(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Benin, His Excellency Mr.\r\nEdgar-Yves Monnou.\r\nMr. Monnou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nYou have the difficult and noble task, Sir, of guiding the\r\nwork of the General Assembly at a time when the United\r\nNations is celebrating 50 years of existence and\r\napproaching a decisive turning-point in its history. Your\r\nelection to this high office is cause for joy and satisfaction\r\nin the delegation of Benin, on behalf of which I have the\r\ngreat honour of speaking from this world-renowned\r\nrostrum.\r\nI am pleased to be able to add my voice to those of\r\npreceding speakers in congratulating you sincerely and\r\nwarmly and also in congratulating the members of your\r\nBureau. I am particularly glad in that you represent a\r\ncountry, Portugal, with which Benin is honoured to have\r\nexcellent relations and valuable cultural ties. It is my belief\r\nthat your experience and your qualities and abilities will\r\nhelp to ensure smooth proceedings and success here in our\r\ndiscussions.\r\nYou, Sir, are taking over your office from my brother\r\nAmara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, to whom I would like to\r\nextend the satisfaction and appreciation of my delegation\r\non the exemplary manner in which he presided over the\r\nwork of the forty-ninth session. In an international\r\nsituation marked by doubt, fatigue and an absence of\r\nresources, he endeavoured with lucidity, resolve and\r\nperseverance to reconfirm the central and irreplaceable\r\nrole of this Organization in attaining peace and social\r\nprogress.\r\nI would also wish fraternally to extend a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, whom I welcome here with us today, a\r\nman of conviction and humanism whom we should\r\nsupport and recognize for his efforts and initiatives to\r\ntranslate into action the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter.\r\nOur world has changed considerably, and the wheels\r\nof history continue to turn inexorably, throwing up their\r\nshare of upheaval and change, which makes even clearer\r\nthe need for a universal forum and an instrument as\r\nvaluable as the United Nations. It has asserted itself as an\r\nessential catalyst for international cooperation based on\r\ninterdependence and an awareness of the common future\r\nof mankind.\r\nThe ceremonies commemorating 50 years of the\r\nUnited Nations give us an opportunity to evaluate what it\r\nhas done. I shall confine myself to just a few points.\r\nThere is a saying in my country that whenever we\r\nhesitate about how to proceed in life, we should look\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nback over the road we have travelled. So, in that\r\ncontext, I would like to recall that there should be three\r\npillars supporting this Organization, namely: the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security; economic and social\r\ndevelopment; and respect for and protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nI think I am right in saying that, since 1945, peace has\r\nin general been maintained. Most States have now gained\r\ntheir sovereignty and their peoples are exercising their\r\nrights, and the fundamental nature of respect for human\r\nrights has been universally recognized.\r\nYet, there are such deep cracks in the second pillar\r\nthat the whole building may crumble. Hence the United\r\nNations is now at a critical turning-point in its history.\r\nIn a world in which economies and markets are being\r\nglobalized, a world that is almost entirely characterized and\r\nunited by the communications revolution and the progress\r\nmade in transport, we soon realized that peace does not\r\nsimply mean that weapons are silent. Increasing\r\ninterdependence has not really created a genuine feeling of\r\nsolidarity. Although this is often said — some of us\r\nspeaking before the international community every year\r\nfrom this rostrum — it has not prompted collective action\r\nto ensure prosperity for all.\r\nThe three pillars that symbolize the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations and its ability to carry out its mandate must\r\nall be strengthened if the building is to continue to stand.\r\nI did not mean to turn my back on Benin’s tradition\r\nby allowing myself to turn the thoughts of this Assembly\r\ntowards symbolism, but rather to highlight the reality of the\r\nproblems we face and the scope of the challenges they\r\nthrow down before us. Human dignity is what is at stake\r\nhere.\r\nThe United Nations can become stronger only by\r\nstrengthening its second pillar, by promoting action in\r\neconomic and social areas, by focusing its concerns on\r\ndevelopment in order to achieve or maintain peace through\r\nthe promotion of social development.\r\nThe Organization therefore has a central role to play\r\nin preventing mankind from drifting towards new\r\nconfrontation and impoverishment, and in enabling man to\r\ngain greater control over his environment and his fate.\r\nThe new dynamic in international relations resulting\r\nfrom the end of ideological confrontation is characterized\r\nby a search for a new kind of inter-State relationship. As\r\na result, the hotbeds of tension and conflict that have not\r\nbeen quelled are now approaching a solution or are being\r\ncontained. And yet, there is still such upheaval in some\r\nparts of the world that international peace and security are\r\nbeing threatened.\r\nI am thinking here of the negotiations between Israel\r\nand Palestine. They are the result of resolute action. We\r\nknow how difficult was the road leading to the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace in view of the level of\r\ndistrust and the acute, accumulated suffering involved.\r\nYet, we have high hopes that bitterness and fear will be\r\novercome so that dialogue may continue. We must all\r\nencourage dialogue between Israel and the States of the\r\nregion, and to that end, the good will of all is essential.\r\nIn Benin, we welcomed the fact that the weapons\r\nhad finally fallen silent in southern Africa. For the first\r\ntime in several decades, the region seems to be able to\r\ndevote all its energies and resources to development\r\nactivities.\r\nHere, we wish to pay tribute to the maturity of the\r\npeople and leaders of Mozambique who have helped to\r\nestablish a State based on the rule of law and political\r\npluralism on the basis of free and democratic elections. I\r\ncan only congratulate the United Nations on what it has\r\ndone to promote peace in that country. We are all\r\nconcerned that peace should be strengthened through\r\nstability, reconciliation and national reconstruction. Faced\r\nwith this situation, the international community must,\r\nmore than ever before, support Mozambique by providing\r\nassistance that can recreate an environment conducive to\r\neconomic development.\r\nI also welcome the agreements signed at Lusaka\r\nbetween the Government of the Republic of Angola and\r\nUNITA, and on behalf of my delegation I should like to\r\nencourage them to live up to the commitments they have\r\nmade.\r\nThe positive developments in Haiti are also most\r\nwelcome. Benin applauds the reinstatement of the\r\nlegitimate Haitian authorities and the courage and sense\r\nof responsibility shown by the President, Jean-Bertrand\r\nAristide, who has engendered a spirit of reconciliation.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts made by the Government of\r\nHaiti to strengthen democracy in the country by\r\nestablishing institutions following free elections. We have\r\nhigh hopes that security and stability can thus be\r\nre-established and will help to promote economic and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nsocial development, the only guarantee of lasting\r\ndemocracy.\r\nUnfortunately, however, in other regions, the course of\r\nhistory is still not running smoothly. This is the case in\r\nSomalia, Rwanda, Burundi and Liberia, where events would\r\nseem to suggest that the protagonists have learned\r\nnothing — but they have forgotten nothing either.\r\nIn Somalia, the absence of any viable State structure\r\nhas plunged the country into an impossible situation with\r\nmomentous consequences. The desire to secure\r\nadvantageous negotiating positions through the use of force\r\nhas led to continued suffering for the country. In expressing\r\nour sympathy for the people of Somalia, Benin wishes to\r\nremind the various factions that they must create the\r\nconditions for dialogue and national reconciliation and we\r\nwould urge them to be tolerant.\r\nIn Rwanda and Burundi, re-establishing the judiciary\r\nand establishing public order would seem to be the only\r\nmeans of putting an end to the spiral of violence and\r\nencouraging national reconciliation, which is a prerequisite\r\nfor establishing trust and encouraging the voluntary return\r\nof refugees. We cannot deny that the slow pace and the\r\nfragility of developments in the situation in those two\r\ncountries raise fears that the tragic events we so recently\r\ndeplored may recur at any moment.\r\nIn Liberia, we welcome the new situation that has\r\nemerged from the cease-fire and the establishment of the\r\nCouncil of State. We urge all parties to strengthen the\r\nrenewed peace by effectively disarming all the factions.\r\nThe former Yugoslavia is undoubtedly the world stage\r\non which new types of conflict and efforts to limit them are\r\nrunning at the same time. While taking what may seem a\r\ndispassionate look at the situation in the Balkans region, we\r\nare not insensitive to the fate of millions of women,\r\nchildren and elderly people who are the victims both of\r\nnew kinds of exclusion and of the irredentism of the\r\npeoples of the region.\r\nI should like to take this occasion to reiterate that\r\nBenin strongly condemns “ethnic cleansing”, no matter who\r\nits perpetrators may be, all violations of humanitarian law\r\nand all attacks against United Nations personnel.\r\nBenin supports the idea of a comprehensive settlement\r\nwith respect to the consequences of the disintegration of the\r\nformer Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia. For this\r\nreason, I appeal to all the protagonists to put an end to\r\nthe fighting and to attacks against innocent civilians.\r\nThe New York agreements of 26 September 1995\r\nbetween the three major protagonist groups constitute a\r\ndecisive step towards general and lasting peace in the\r\nregion, which, I trust, will soon cease to be the powder-\r\nkeg of today’s world.\r\nThe deplorable, indeed tragic, situations that I have\r\njust described strengthen my conviction that the protection\r\nand promotion of human rights and of fundamental\r\nfreedoms still deserve our full attention. They justify the\r\ndrafting of new international instruments to complete the\r\nexisting legal arsenal, so that those who continue to\r\nperpetrate cruel and inhuman acts, genocide and “ethnic\r\ncleansing” can be punished. In this spirit, Benin supports\r\nthe establishment of international tribunals for the former\r\nYugoslavia and Rwanda.\r\nBut what will all these efforts mean if we do not put\r\nan end to the production, accumulation and international\r\ntransfers of weapons, and if we do not progress towards\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament under international\r\ncontrol?\r\nIn this connection, Benin reiterates its unwavering\r\nsupport for all United Nations resolutions relating to the\r\nreduction, limitation and non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nOne of the mandates of this Organization is to make\r\ngeneral development efforts the focus of our concerns.\r\nChanges in international relations and the liberalization of\r\ntrade have made us more aware of the many different\r\nsectors and players involved in development. The\r\ndeterioration of our environment has alerted us to the\r\nneed to focus our behaviour and actions on ensuring the\r\nlong-term development of future generations.\r\nWe are both witnesses to and players in the changes\r\nwe are experiencing today. And yet we are not\r\nunequipped to implement the transition to another kind of\r\ndevelopment, because we have at our disposal the tools\r\nfor both diagnosis and prevention. There is only one\r\npossible approach: the political will to implement our\r\nrespective commitments.\r\nI should like to emphasize that as concerns\r\nimplementation of their commitments the developing\r\ncountries in general, and Africa and the least developed\r\ncountries in particular, have proceeded resolutely towards\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nqualitative political and economic changes. In so doing,\r\nthey have required enormous sacrifices on the part of their\r\npeoples in order to readjust and adapt to new world\r\nconditions.\r\nWe must acknowledge, however, that the commitments\r\nto carry out the duty of solidarity have not yet materialized.\r\nBenin, of course, fully appreciates the international\r\ncommunity‘s support for the developing countries, and\r\nparticularly for Africa and the least-developed countries in\r\ngeneral. However, the assistance provided is far from\r\nmeeting either the needs or the expectations.\r\nI sincerely hope that the results of the High-level\r\nIntergovernmental Meeting on the Mid-term Global Review\r\nof the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nLeast-developed Countries for the 1990s, which began here\r\nin New York on 26 September, will make it possible to\r\novercome these shortcomings.\r\nI urge the international community to live up to its\r\ncommitment to solidarity with Africa by contributing to the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s. At the high-level meetings of the Economic\r\nand Social Council held in Geneva from 4 to 6 July last,\r\nthe international community reconfirmed its commitment to\r\ncontribute effectively to the development of Africa and to\r\nthe implementation of this New Agenda.\r\nIt is therefore urgent — and this cannot be said often\r\nenough — to reduce the debt burden to a level that would\r\nenable us truly to set development in motion. I should like\r\nalso to invite all States to speed up their respective\r\nconstitutional procedures for ratifying the United Nations\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nThe demonstrations organized worldwide at the time\r\nof the first World Day to Combat Desertification and\r\nDrought bear witness to the commitment of peoples and\r\nGovernments to tackling seriously this worldwide\r\nenvironmental problem. This commitment must be backed\r\nby the depositing of the 50 ratification instruments needed\r\nfor the entry into force of the Convention in 1996. The first\r\nconference of the parties could thus take place in 1997, the\r\nyear earmarked for the mid-term review of Agenda 21 and\r\nof all the recommendations and conclusions of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development.\r\nMeasures must also be taken to speed up the\r\nintegration of Africa into the international trade system and\r\nto help in diversifying economies and encouraging\r\ninvestment. Only in this way will that continent, which\r\nhas suffered greatly throughout history, be able finally to\r\nemerge from the hellish cycle of poverty.\r\nBenin is prepared to contribute to making 1996, the\r\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty, an\r\noccasion for us to strengthen the moral obligation and\r\nduty of solidarity that underlies the struggle against\r\npoverty. But our Governments’ actions can be successful\r\nonly if they are supported by all our partners in\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe year 1996 will also see the holding of the Ninth\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\nand the Second United Nations Conference on Human\r\nSettlements (Habitat II), which is being referred to as the\r\n“City Summit”. These two major Conferences, whose\r\nimportance cannot be overemphasized, will provide to the\r\ninternational community an opportunity to assess the\r\nprogress made in the context of the commitment entered\r\ninto at Cartagena in February 1992 and of the Global\r\nStrategy for Shelter to the Year 2000. However, the\r\npreparatory committees for those two Conferences must\r\nfocus on finding specific solutions rather than short-lived\r\nmeasures and recommendations.\r\nI am convinced that development cannot be achieved\r\nsimply by transferring one model of production and\r\nconsumption from one region of the world to another. We\r\nmust go beyond that cliché and base ourselves on a true\r\npartnership for development, in which responsibilities\r\nwould be shared equally. For this reason, Benin welcomes\r\nthe outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and of the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen.\r\nBenin fully endorses the elaboration of an Agenda\r\nfor Development with a view to the effective\r\nimplementation of the programmes of action that have not\r\nyet been carried out.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our firm\r\nconviction that this session of the General Assembly will\r\nmake it easier for us to achieve a consensus acceptable to\r\nall on ways and means of revitalizing and strengthening\r\nthe institutions and structures of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Korea, His Excellency\r\nMr. Ro-Myung Gong.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nMr. Gong Ro-Myung (Republic of Korea): Mr.\r\nPresident, congratulations on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of this historic fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations. Leadership has never been\r\nmore critical to this Organization, and we are most grateful\r\nfor the able work of your predecessor, Foreign Minister\r\nAmara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, and of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nWe stand at the threshold of a new era, a time of great\r\nperil and magnificent promise. The choices that we make\r\nin the coming weeks and months could rejuvenate the\r\nUnited Nations for a new century of cooperation and\r\nprogress, or they could consign the world body to years of\r\nstagnation, decline, and irrelevance. Neither path is\r\ninevitable, and none of the United Nations shortcomings are\r\nirreparable. The choice is ours.\r\nThe world, like the United Nations, is in a period of\r\ntransition and flux. Virulent local conflicts in several\r\nregions are being met with global cooperation to contain the\r\nviolence, assist the victims and mend the political and\r\neconomic fabric of the shattered societies. During this past\r\nweek alone, patient and firm diplomacy has yielded\r\nencouraging results in the Middle East and the former\r\nYugoslavia, two areas known more for conflict than\r\ncompromise. In some places, however, gross violations of\r\nhuman rights and genocide are being committed, even as\r\ngreat strides are taken globally by way of strengthening\r\ninternational law and human rights standards, most recently\r\nthrough the Fourth World Conference on Women. As the\r\nfields of communications, trade and technology have\r\nexpanded to global proportions, interdependence has\r\nbecome a fact of life.\r\nIn a world of change, no institution — least of all the\r\nUnited Nations — can afford to stand still. The world body,\r\nafter all, is an experiment. Launched by leaders of vision,\r\nforesight, and courage at another historic turning point half\r\na century ago, the United Nations has steadfastly stood for\r\nchange through peaceful means, for cooperation over\r\nconflict, and for hope over despair. Today, we have been\r\ncalled upon to reinvent the world Organization to meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, while we recommit\r\nourselves to its founding, and enduring, principles.\r\nThere is little doubt that this is a time of testing for\r\nthe United Nations, but really it is the Member States — all\r\n185 of us — that are being challenged as never before. It\r\nis our collective will, commitment, and inspiration — or\r\nlack thereof — that will determine the fate of history’s\r\ngreatest experiment in international organization. Our\r\nresponsibilities begin with paying our financial obligations\r\nin full and on time, but they run much deeper and wider.\r\nThe Republic of Korea recognizes that the time has come\r\nfor far-reaching reform in the way the United Nations\r\nconducts its business and structures its programmes.\r\nKorea gladly joins the many other nations to make this\r\nhistoric General Assembly session a time of reflection,\r\nrecommitment, and renewal.\r\nNo dimension of the United Nations work has been\r\nmore severely or dramatically tested than its far-flung\r\npeace operations. All of us owe a debt of gratitude to the\r\nmen and women from 70 countries whose courage and\r\nfortitude have kept the hope of peace alive under the most\r\ndifficult and trying circumstances. We have asked them\r\nto accomplish a great deal with very little. If the United\r\nNations is to respond effectively to the new forms of\r\nconflict that threaten peace and human security in today’s\r\nuncertain world, it is imperative that its peace operations\r\nbe strengthened and renovated. We appreciate the ongoing\r\nefforts to enhance the preventive diplomacy and rapid\r\nreaction capabilities of the United Nations, both within\r\nand outside the framework of the Organization.\r\nOne of the most promising avenues for bolstering\r\nUnited Nations capabilities is the United Nations stand-by\r\narrangement system, and I would encourage the broadest\r\npossible participation by Member States. Today, my\r\nGovernment reaffirms its decision to take part in the\r\nUnited Nations stand-by system and its willingness to\r\nprovide some 800 men for this effort, including an\r\ninfantry battalion, engineering units, medical units and\r\nmilitary observers.\r\nSince Korea’s first participation in United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations in Somalia in 1993, when it sent\r\nan engineering battalion to the United Nations Operation\r\nin Somalia (UNOSOM II), it has dispatched a medical\r\nunit to the Western Sahara and military observers to both\r\nthe United Nations Military Observer Group in India and\r\nPakistan (UNMOGIP) in Kashmir and the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). I am also\r\npleased to inform the Assembly that next week a Korean\r\nbridging unit of engineers will arrive in Angola to take\r\npart in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEMIII).\r\nMy Government is determined to expand its\r\ncontributions to the peace-keeping operations of the\r\nUnited Nations at a level commensurate with our national\r\ncapacity.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nAs one of the troop-contributing countries to United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations, we feel a great deal of\r\nconcern over the fact that the number of casualties among\r\nUnited Nations peace-keepers is sharply increasing and that\r\ntheir safety is frequently endangered.\r\nWe firmly believe that hostile acts against United\r\nNations personnel, such as armed attack and hostage-taking,\r\nare absolutely unacceptable and should not go unpunished.\r\nWhile we appreciate efforts for the protection of United\r\nNations personnel, such as the conclusion of the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated\r\nPersonnel, we feel that it is the collective responsibility of\r\nall Member States of the United Nations to ensure the\r\nsafety and security of United Nations peace-keepers.\r\nThe challenges before the United Nations, of course,\r\nare hardly confined to traditional security concerns. Unrest\r\nin many parts of the world serves to remind us of the\r\neconomic, social and political roots of conflict. Uneven\r\npatterns of economic and social development are of\r\nparticular concern.\r\nOn the positive side, despite a slight decline in growth\r\nsince last year, the recent economic recovery of the\r\ndeveloped countries and sustained growth in a large number\r\nof developing countries have helped boost the global\r\neconomy in 1995. Economies in transition have shown\r\nencouraging signs of improvement. The overall economic\r\nsituation in Africa has also made headway, albeit slow and\r\nmodest.\r\nHowever, developing countries, particularly those in\r\nAfrica, require the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity in their developmental efforts. Fostering a\r\nfavourable external economic environment for them is\r\nessential. In this regard, my delegation believes that the\r\ndebate in the Economic and Social Council on the theme of\r\ndevelopment in Africa this year was both timely and\r\nappropriate.\r\nIn strengthening its cooperation with developing\r\ncountries, particularly with the least developed countries,\r\nmy Government places primary emphasis on human\r\nresources development. We are implementing a plan, which\r\nwas announced by President Kim Young Sam at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen, to provide\r\ntechnical training for over 30,000 people from developing\r\ncountries, particularly from the African continent, by the\r\nyear 2010.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the issue of development\r\nis receiving renewed attention as a pre-eminent global\r\nconcern. My Government is actively participating in the\r\nWorking Group of the General Assembly on “An Agenda\r\nfor Development”. Although the primary responsibility for\r\ndevelopment falls on the individual Government, we\r\nbelieve that national development efforts also require the\r\nassistance of the international community.\r\nIn that spirit, we vigorously support the multilateral\r\nefforts to realize sustainable global development. As a\r\nfollow-up to President Kim’s announcement at the\r\nCopenhagen Summit of our intention to increase our\r\nofficial development assistance, we plan to enlarge our\r\nvoluntary contribution to the operational activities of the\r\nUnited Nations by 65 per cent next year, and will\r\ncontinue such efforts in the coming years.\r\nIn our view, the Copenhagen Social Summit was a\r\nmilestone, not only because it laid a sound foundation for\r\ninternational assistance and cooperation in the area of\r\nsustainable social development, but also because it charted\r\na clear direction for future action.\r\nWomen’s issues have also become a key part of the\r\nglobal agenda. My Government welcomes the recent\r\ndiscussions in Beijing on the enhancement of the status of\r\nwomen and looks forward to the full and early\r\nimplementation of the plan of action adopted at the\r\nConference.\r\nThe protection and enhancement of human rights are\r\nan enduring task. The inalienable and basic rights of\r\nhuman beings must be faithfully protected and preserved.\r\nAs articulated in the Vienna Declaration, the primary\r\nresponsibility for protecting human rights should be borne\r\nby the respective Government. However, it should also be\r\nnoted that the cooperation and attention of the\r\ninternational community, including the United Nations,\r\nare paramount to the efforts in this field.\r\nSince the inauguration of President Kim Young Sam\r\nin February 1993, the Government of the Republic of\r\nKorea has placed an especially high priority on the\r\npromotion of democracy and human rights. The\r\nGovernment has ardently supported the democratization\r\nprocess and has successfully taken various reform\r\nmeasures to promote human rights in the country. I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to express my\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nGovernment’s deep concern over the human rights situation\r\nin North Korea. As my Government strongly believes that\r\nthe people in North Korea, as our kindred, should enjoy the\r\nfundamental human rights to which all of us are entitled,\r\nwe urge Pyongyang to respond positively to the\r\ninternational calls for the protection of human rights,\r\nespecially through opening its society.\r\nAn outstanding and emotional dimension of this issue\r\nis the division of families on the Korean Peninsula. During\r\nthe Korean War, in 1950 to 1953, 10 million people were\r\nseparated from their families. Most were never to hear from\r\neach other again, because even the exchange of letters was\r\nprohibited between the two Koreas. Even after the war,\r\nhundreds of South Koreans were forcibly taken to North\r\nKorea against their will, leaving behind families grieving\r\nover separation and anguished by the uncertainty of whether\r\nthe other members were still alive. I believe that it is high\r\ntime for the community of nations, particularly the United\r\nNations, to render its assistance and do its part for these\r\ndivided families so that they may at least hear from each\r\nother until they are finally reunited.\r\nTurning to the issue of disarmament, I would like to\r\ntake this occasion to declare, on behalf of my Government,\r\na one-year moratorium, which may be extended, on the\r\nexport of anti-personnel land-mines. We hope that our\r\ndecision will strengthen the international efforts to limit the\r\nproliferation of land-mines and to end their indiscriminate\r\nuse.\r\nConsidering the continued importance of the\r\nConference on Disarmament as a unique negotiating forum\r\nfor disarmament, my delegation welcomes the decision on\r\nexpansion of membership of the Conference, adopted by\r\nconsensus at its plenary meeting a week ago. We hope that\r\nthe countries of the Group of 23 that wish to participate in\r\nthe Conference will be given full-fledged membership at\r\nthe earliest possible date.\r\nThe Republic of Korea, as one of the original\r\nsignatories to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993,\r\nhas taken steps to ratify the Convention with a view to\r\nsupporting the international endeavours to prohibit and\r\neliminate all types of weapons of mass destruction. As we\r\nall recognize, universal adherence to the Convention is an\r\nessential step towards securing an effective non-\r\nproliferation regime in this area. The Republic of Korea\r\ntherefore strongly urges those countries, including the\r\nDPRK, which have not yet joined the Convention to do so\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nIn our efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons, the indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty (NPT) by consensus last May was a watershed\r\nevent. We urge the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their\r\nresponsibilities under the NPT to make the world nuclear-\r\nfree. In this regard, my delegation joins the call of many\r\nother countries for the early conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, a global agreement which\r\nwould undoubtedly help facilitate the eventual elimination\r\nof nuclear weapons as envisaged in the NPT.\r\nIn the same spirit, it is deeply regrettable that some\r\ncountries with nuclear weapons are still engaged in\r\nnuclear testing. On behalf of the Government and people\r\nof the Republic of Korea, I would like to urge those\r\nnations with future plans for testing to cancel them\r\nwithout delay.\r\nMy delegation strongly endorses the efforts to\r\nstrengthen the safeguards system of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We believe that the\r\nfuture of the NPT also depends upon cooperation between\r\nStates in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In this\r\nregard, we believe that the legitimate demands of the non-\r\nnuclear States to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy should be duly respected and that resolute\r\nmeasures should be taken against those States that fail to\r\nfulfil their obligations under the IAEA safeguards system.\r\nThe North Korean nuclear issue remains a\r\nparamount security concern for North-East Asia and the\r\nworld. The Republic of Korea urges North Korea once\r\nagain not only to comply with its NPT obligations and\r\nIAEA safeguards in a full and complete manner, but also\r\nfaithfully to implement the Geneva Agreed Framework\r\nbetween the United States and the DPRK of October\r\n1994. Furthermore, North Korea should live up to its\r\ncommitments and obligations under the Joint Declaration\r\non Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\r\nMaintaining peace and stability on the Korean\r\nPeninsula is not just an issue affecting 70 million\r\nKoreans, but also a strategic issue with critical\r\nimplications for the North-East Asia region and the world\r\nat large. Accordingly, we believe that the current\r\narmistice agreement must be kept in force until a\r\npermanent peace mechanism is set in place. With a view\r\nto dealing with all inter-Korean issues, my Government\r\nearnestly hopes that the North Korean leadership will\r\nrespond positively to our call for inter-Korean dialogue\r\nand cooperation.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nAs I noted at the outset, the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations provides a unique opportunity for the\r\ninternational community to revitalize, strengthen and reform\r\nthe United Nations system. To this end, a number of\r\nproposals, studies and reports have been put forward. My\r\nGovernment is closely following the constructive\r\ndiscussions which have been conducted thus far in the\r\nworking groups of the General Assembly seeking ways to\r\naugment the effectiveness, efficiency and democracy of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs for the Security Council, we are of the view that\r\nin reforming it account should be taken first and foremost\r\nof the need for equitable geographical representation in its\r\nmembership and enhanced transparency and efficiency in its\r\nworking methods. Given the utmost importance of the issue\r\nand its implication for other issues, we will remain flexible\r\nand open-minded to various ideas and suggestions and\r\nmake due contributions to the process of consensus-\r\nbuilding. We also believe that the coordinating role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should be strengthened,\r\nparticularly in the area of operational activities.\r\nOn the financial aspect of the United Nations, it is\r\nalarming to note that the total amount of unpaid\r\nassessments is well over $3.5 billion. An effective solution\r\nto the current financial difficulties should be found in order\r\nto meet the increasing demands of the United Nations and\r\nto strengthen it. It is in this context that we again urge all\r\nMember States to pay their assessed contributions on time\r\nand in full.\r\nIn order for reform to be successful, however, it is\r\ncrucial to secure a broad consensus among Member States.\r\nWe must not forget that consolidated political will, mutual\r\nconfidence and a sense of common interest and benefit\r\namong Member States are key elements in the process of\r\nreform. In this spirit, reform begins at home, in\r\nrededicating ourselves to the community of interests and\r\nprinciples that serve to unite the disparate nations of the\r\nworld.\r\nIn three weeks, in this Hall, the leaders of more than\r\n150 nations — three times as many as met in San Francisco\r\na half-century ago — will reaffirm their commitment to the\r\nideals and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs the nations and peoples of the world reflect upon\r\nwhat the United Nations has achieved in its first half-\r\ncentury and what it should aspire to in the years ahead, the\r\nRepublic of Korea wishes to renew its determination to\r\nrender full and unswerving support for the revitalization\r\nof the world body in the years ahead. We believe in the\r\ncollective ability of nations to build a safer, more\r\nprosperous and just world, and we are committed to do\r\nour part.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden,\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Lena Hjelm-Wallén.\r\nMrs. Hjelm-Wallén (Sweden): First of all I should\r\nlike to welcome the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement\r\nbeing signed today in Washington by Yasser Arafat and\r\nYitzhak Rabin. This show of reconciliation should be an\r\nexample to parties in various conflicts the world over.\r\nAs the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, it is time to look to the future. The world is\r\ndifferent. The end of the cold war, the spread of\r\ndemocracy, economic globalization, and the explosive\r\ngrowth of communications have led to far-reaching\r\nchanges. Distances between people are shorter, national\r\nboundaries are more open and global interdependence is\r\nincreasingly apparent.\r\nSecurity is no longer primarily a military matter.\r\nSecurity also implies building confidence, justice and\r\nequal opportunities to achieve lasting and sustainable\r\npeace, both within countries and through closer\r\ncooperation between countries and peoples.\r\nSuch cooperation is needed at the regional and\r\nglobal levels. Further enlargement of the European Union\r\nwould be a step towards a pan-European community for\r\npeace and security. We have a historic opportunity to\r\ncreate a united Europe, ultimately developing integration\r\nand cooperation to a point where war becomes\r\ninconceivable anywhere on our continent. In my vision,\r\nthe European Union must be a genuine peace project,\r\nopening itself towards the rest of Europe and the rest of\r\nthe world.\r\nAt the same time, major threats to human security\r\nare global. They must be met by global action. Thus, we\r\nmust revitalize the United Nations system, and adapt the\r\nOrganization to the new reality. We need an effective\r\ninstrument for global cooperation — for peace and\r\nsecurity, for sustainable development, for justice and for\r\na life in dignity for all.\r\nWe are more convinced than ever that, with 50 years\r\nof experience, the United Nations is an indispensable tool\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nfor achieving these goals. Fifty years of experience have\r\nstrengthened our support for the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nIn pursuit of these goals, United Nations personnel all\r\nover the world are making major contributions. They merit\r\nour deep gratitude. We pay special tribute to those who\r\nhave lost their lives in the service of the world community\r\nand we extend our sympathy to their families.\r\nAppalling pictures of human suffering in Somalia,\r\nRwanda and former Yugoslavia force their way into our\r\nhomes. We see the United Nations humiliated. The apparent\r\nshortcomings of the world Organization have sown doubts\r\nabout the feasibility of multilateral global cooperation. But\r\nthe problems of the United Nations are in fact those of its\r\nMember States. They result from a combination of growing\r\nneeds and expectations, on the one hand, and insufficient\r\nresources and a lack of political will, on the other.\r\nSweden’s former Prime Minister, Olof Palme,\r\ndeveloped this theme in a speech he gave from this rostrum\r\n10 years ago at the special commemorative session to mark\r\nthe fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. He said:\r\n“Let us not make the United Nations the\r\nscapegoat for problems that reflect our own\r\nshortcomings. It is not the United Nations that has not\r\nlived up to us; it is we who have not lived up to the\r\nideals of the United Nations. It is by improving\r\nourselves and our policies that we can improve the\r\nUnited Nations.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fortieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 43rd\r\nmeeting, p. 64)\r\nLet us not curse the dark but instead shed light. Let us\r\ndraw lessons both from the more difficult United Nations\r\noperations of recent years, and the more successful ones —\r\nEl Salvador, Namibia, Mozambique and Cambodia.\r\nWe have learned that we must take action at an early\r\nstage, before the catastrophe is a fact, before the genie of\r\nviolence has escaped from the bottle. The United Nations\r\nCharter offers plenty of scope for preventive efforts. Action\r\nmust be undertaken with the consent of the States\r\nconcerned and their sovereignty must be respected. We\r\nappeal to Governments: in an internal conflict accept the\r\nassistance offered by the United Nations or by a regional\r\norganization.\r\nPrevention is seldom glamorous. It does not make\r\nheadlines. Long-term, often tedious, work, with the focus\r\non the fundamental causes of conflicts, must be backed\r\nup by deliberate political support.\r\nMore resources must be earmarked for preventive\r\nmeasures. This is an investment that is needed if we are\r\nto avoid new tragedies. The Swedish Government is\r\ncurrently studying how to improve the United Nations\r\ncapacity for early-warning and preventive action.\r\nWe have learned to focus on the security and needs\r\nof human beings. Our goal must always be human\r\ncoexistence, irrespective of cultural, religious or ethnic\r\ndifferences. We must never confine ourselves to drawing\r\nup maps that reflect the realities of power politics. We\r\nmust never accept the evil of “ethnic cleansing”. If we do,\r\nwe will ultimately threaten ourselves and our future.\r\nWe have also learned the importance of the\r\nprinciples of international law and respect for human\r\nrights. Humanitarian law must be defended and reinforced\r\nand war crimes investigated. For example, we must find\r\nout what happened to those who disappeared in\r\nSrebrenica and Zepa. By bringing war criminals to trial\r\nwe will enhance respect for humanitarian law.\r\nPerpetrators of cruelty, rape and torture must be made to\r\nunderstand that they cannot act out their perversions with\r\nimpunity. We support the international criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the former Yugoslavia, and the Rwanda tribunal.\r\nWe have learned that a democratic culture provides\r\ngreater potential for prevention and conflict resolution.\r\nContinued democratization within individual countries\r\nmust be encouraged, underpinning a democratic\r\ninternational community. Sweden is honoured to be the\r\nhost country of the International Institute for Democracy\r\nand Electoral Assistance (IDEA), which supports\r\ndemocratization processes throughout the world. The work\r\nof IDEA will be a valuable complement to the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations and non-governmental organizations\r\nin this area.\r\nWe have learned that troops must be made available\r\nfor rapid-reaction operations when non-military measures\r\nhave failed. As a conflict begins to escalate, every hour\r\nis precious. The lack of well-trained and well-equipped\r\npeace-keeping forces, ready to be deployed at short\r\nnotice, may preclude successful action. Failure to achieve\r\nthe proper execution of Security Council decisions due to\r\nlack of troops undermines respect for the United Nations.\r\nWe welcome the efforts made — by Canada and\r\nDenmark for example — to improve the United Nations\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nstand-by capacity. Sweden will contribute an international\r\nforce to achieve this objective.\r\nWe have also learned that the Security Council\r\nmandates for United Nations peace operations must be\r\nmore precisely formulated. Clear messages to the parties\r\nconcerned are necessary. Unclear mandates may lead to\r\nambiguous perceptions of the United Nations role in a\r\nconflict.\r\nWe have learned the need to strengthen the United\r\nNations ability to command and control peace operations.\r\nWe welcome the reinforcements of the Secretariat that have\r\ntaken place. Confusion occurs when troop-contributing\r\ncountries intervene in the field through direct contacts with\r\ntheir own contingents. An effective forum for consultations\r\nwith troop contributors could add to more effective\r\nmanagement of peace operations. Such a forum should be\r\nestablished under the Security Council, preferably in\r\naccordance with Article 29 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe have also learned that coordination of diplomatic,\r\nhumanitarian and military efforts must be improved. Those\r\nwho are to do the work in the field — humanitarian\r\norganizations and potential troop-contributing countries —\r\nshould participate at an early stage in discussions on the\r\nimplementation of mandates for complex United Nations\r\npeace operations. In this context, I would like to underline\r\nthe importance of the United Nations Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs.\r\nFurther, we have learned the need to involve\r\nnon-governmental organizations in such humanitarian\r\noperations. We have learned the value of comprehensive\r\nUnited Nations efforts in which humanitarian assistance,\r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and long-term peace-building\r\nare carried out simultaneously, thus mutually reinforcing\r\neach other.\r\nWe have learned that monitoring respect for human\r\nrights can build confidence, thus allaying fears and\r\npreventing the use of force.\r\nWe have learned the vital importance of regional\r\norganizations for peace and security, as foreseen in Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. The Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is already\r\nplaying a prominent role in conflict management in Europe.\r\nIn other parts of the world — in Africa, Asia and the\r\nAmericas — regional and subregional organizations are in\r\na position to fulfil similar tasks, if necessary with the\r\nsupport of the United Nations.\r\nMilitary operations should be based on decisions\r\ntaken by the United Nations, the OSCE or corresponding\r\norganizations in other regions. Other regional\r\narrangements may have a role in organizing and executing\r\nsuch operations, but the bodies I have just mentioned\r\nshould assume overall political and strategic\r\nresponsibility.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations offers an opportunity to\r\nestablish a solid basis for improved global cooperation.\r\nSweden welcomes the reform process now under way in\r\nthe United Nations. To embrace multilateralism we must\r\nall rise above short-sighted interests and focus on what is\r\nbest for global cooperation. We need political leadership\r\nfrom Governments if we are to make progress.\r\nAdapting the United Nations to the demands of the\r\nnew era will involve hard work and difficult negotiations.\r\nWe must not miss the opportunity provided by this\r\nanniversary. We need speedy progress. A clear timetable\r\nand a comprehensive framework are required for\r\nnecessary change.\r\nThe Commission on Global Governance, under the\r\nchairmanship of Sir Shridath Ramphal and the Prime\r\nMinister of Sweden, Ingvar Carlsson, offers several\r\nproposals for a stronger, more efficient and more\r\ndemocratic United Nations. The Commission’s report is\r\na valuable contribution and a source of inspiration for\r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\nIn order to be effective and more representative, the\r\nSecurity Council requires enlargement. We would\r\nwelcome Germany and Japan as permanent members. At\r\nthe same time, the need for geographical balance must be\r\nmet. We want a more transparent Security Council. We\r\nwant a composition and a decision-making process which\r\nprevent the division of the world into spheres of interest.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should be reviewed\r\nafter 15 to 20 years with a view to maintaining its\r\nlegitimacy and to achieving optimum flexibility.\r\nWe meet at a time when the financial situation of\r\nthe United Nations is critical. Last Monday the Nordic\r\nForeign Ministers, in a joint statement, highlighted the\r\nthreat to multilateralism caused by the present financial\r\ncrisis. Nowhere is the crisis in multilateralism seen more\r\nclearly than in the unwillingness of some Member States\r\nto pay their assessed contributions to the United Nations\r\nin full, without conditions and on time. It is unacceptable\r\nthat so far only one third of the Member States have paid\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\ntheir regular-budget contributions for this year. Countries\r\nconstantly demand more from the Organization, yet some\r\nof them are not willing to pay their membership fees. They\r\napparently want others to foot the bill.\r\nUnilateral withholding of payment cannot be justified.\r\nUnilateral measures undermine multilateralism, particularly\r\nwhen taken by the single most important contributor. It is\r\nhumiliating to see the Secretary-General spend time and\r\nenergy begging for funds when the world community is\r\ndemanding that the United Nations concentrate fully on the\r\ntasks which it was designed for.\r\nThe United Nations needs revised scales of assessment\r\nto better reflect Member States’ ability to pay. Together\r\nwith the United Kingdom, my Government has presented\r\nconcrete proposals to address this problem.\r\nIn the longer term, the resource base of the United\r\nNations must be strengthened. The possibility of additional\r\nsources of funding needs also to be considered.\r\nPoverty and social misery are the greatest long-term\r\nthreats to international peace and security. Some of the\r\npoorest countries have been caught in vicious circles of\r\ndebt management. The United Nations must be given a\r\nstronger and better-defined role in the economic and social\r\nfields.\r\nA clearer division of work is called for in development\r\nassistance. Better coordination, more distinct priorities and\r\nmore effective management by the United Nations\r\ndevelopment agencies are required. The governing boards\r\nof these agencies must be in a better position to play their\r\nleading role in the implementation of development\r\nassistance. Furthermore, we need improved forms of\r\nfinancing, with a higher proportion of assistance levied and\r\nnegotiated in advance. More long-term planning of\r\nassistance is required, and the flow of funds must become\r\nmore predictable.\r\nSweden continues to be one of the largest voluntary\r\ncontributors to United Nations economic and social\r\nactivities. We expect other donor countries to assume their\r\nresponsibilities to the same degree. As regards total\r\ndevelopment assistance, it must be possible for most donor\r\ncountries to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross national product.\r\nThe United Nations is contemporary with the atomic\r\nbomb. Today we no longer accept living under a nuclear\r\nthreat. The indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was an important\r\nstep in the right direction. We urge those few States\r\nwhich have not yet acceded to the NPT to do so without\r\nfurther delay, thus making it clear to the world\r\ncommunity that they renounce the nuclear-weapon option.\r\nIn May of this year the 180 States which have\r\nacceded to the NPT confirmed that the ultimate goal is to\r\nabolish nuclear weapons. International bans on chemical\r\nand biological weapons are already in place. It should be\r\npossible, if there is political will, to achieve within 10 to\r\n15 years an agreement prohibiting nuclear weapons, thus\r\nmaking this threat to human existence a brief interlude in\r\nour history.\r\nA comprehensive test-ban treaty must be achieved in\r\n1996, banning all nuclear tests for all time. In the\r\nmeantime, we urge the nuclear-weapon States to refrain\r\nfrom all nuclear testing in order to ensure that faith in a\r\nfuture free from fear of a nuclear holocaust can be\r\nsustained.\r\nEvery day, every hour, around the world,\r\nanti-personnel mines indiscriminately maim innocent\r\ncivilians, many of them children. The ongoing Conference\r\nin Vienna to review the 1980 weapons Convention should\r\nresult in a strongly and concretely reinforced regime\r\nagainst anti-personnel mines. This is a fundamental, moral\r\nand humanitarian imperative, and it is one step on the\r\nroad to a total international ban on the use of\r\nanti-personnel mines. Moreover, substantial resources\r\nneed to be invested in efficient mine clearance. Sweden\r\nis ready to contribute expertise and assist in the\r\ndevelopment of more advanced technology in this field.\r\nFurthermore, at the Vienna Conference, Sweden has\r\nproposed an additional protocol on blinding weapons. For\r\nmore than a decade we have worked for explicit\r\nprohibition of blinding as a method of warfare. We now\r\nhope that it will be universally accepted.\r\nSecurity is a broad concept in today’s world. We\r\nknow that poverty, social injustice, environmental\r\ndegradation, rapid population growth and massive refugee\r\nflows create fear, disruption and conflicts.\r\nThe major United Nations conferences on\r\nenvironment and development, human rights, population,\r\nsocial issues, women and human settlement all involved\r\ncrucial questions of survival. We welcome the outcome of\r\nthese conferences, the most recent of which was the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing. We\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nneed to address both the root causes and the consequences\r\nof social injustice. Sustainable social and economic\r\ndevelopment can be achieved only with the full\r\nparticipation of women.\r\nTo Sweden, multilateral cooperation is the most\r\nimportant instrument for mastering the crucial issues of\r\nsurvival. For this reason, we will continue to be an active\r\nMember of the United Nations. For this reason, we believe\r\nwholeheartedly that multilateralism is not only a matter of\r\nsolidarity, but, indeed, a question of enlightened self-\r\ninterest.\r\nAs an expression of our strong commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations and to international peace and security,\r\nSweden is a candidate for a seat on the Security Council in\r\n1997-98. Our candidacy is a matter of highest priority for\r\nthe Swedish Government and the Swedish people. It has\r\nbeen launched with the full support of the other four Nordic\r\ncountries. As a member of the Council, we will make a\r\nconstructive contribution to its work. Our dedication will be\r\nconsistent with our record as a United Nations Member.\r\nOur support for United Nations ideals and activities is\r\nconcrete, substantial and unwavering.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Ukraine, Mr.\r\nHennadiy Udovenko.\r\nMr. Udovenko (Ukraine): I should like first of all to\r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral, on his election to that high position.\r\nTo guide the proceedings of the most representative organ\r\nof the United Nations in its jubilee year is a great privilege\r\nfor a politician and diplomat, as well as for the country that\r\nhe represents. We hope that his vision of the future of the\r\nOrganization, contained in his opening remarks, will find\r\nsupport among Member States.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine also expresses its gratitude\r\nto Mr. Amara Essy for successfully guiding the General\r\nAssembly at its last session. Many years of close\r\ncooperation have bonded me with Minister Essy, whom I\r\nhighly respect for his diplomatic and human qualities.\r\nIn the historical calendar there are dates that can never\r\nbe forgotten. The year 1945 is one such memorable time.\r\nRecently, we all commemorated together the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the end of the Second World War. The\r\ncalendar of international life is for ever interwoven with the\r\nhalf-century history of the United Nations.\r\nIn paying tribute to the founders of the United\r\nNations, Ukraine among them, our delegation would like\r\nto note the leading role of President Franklin Delano\r\nRoosevelt — one of the initiators of the creation of the\r\nuniversal Organization and the author of its very name —\r\nthe United Nations. We are confident that the United\r\nNations can work out an appropriate way in which to pay\r\nrespect to this outstanding person.\r\nDuring the past half century the United Nations, as\r\nno other international organization, has acquired\r\ncredibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace,\r\nas a mediator and active participant in the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts, and as a champion of human\r\nrights. The United Nations has played a decisive role in\r\nthe decolonization and self-determination of peoples. The\r\nUnited Nations has proved its viability, having\r\nexperienced the difficult decades of the cold war, when\r\nthe walls and the rostrum of its Headquarters often\r\nwitnessed the struggle of two opposing blocs. Ukraine —\r\nwhose institutions of statehood were developing along\r\nwith the United Nations and were fully established after\r\nthe proclamation of independence in 1991 — feels the\r\nconsiderable support of the United Nations as well.\r\nWitness the dramatic events of the past quarter of\r\nthe twentieth century, the pinnacle of the philosophic\r\ntriangle of “peace-development-democracy” is peace. And\r\nthe most illustrative example of this is the tragic conflict\r\nin the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This conflict, by\r\nits very nature, is due to all possible reasons: militant\r\nseparatism, ethnic confrontation, religious intolerance. The\r\nmost dangerous thing is the fact that, in terms of its scale,\r\ndevelopments and tragic consequences, this conflict has\r\nturned into a real threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. I think that for all of us, Members of the United\r\nNations, the painful fact is that we are compelled again\r\nand again to return to this issue, even during the jubilee\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in this\r\nregion have revealed both positive and negative aspects of\r\ninternational efforts. The Yugoslav example demonstrates,\r\nin general, that rethinking the role of the United Nations\r\nand adapting the role to current realities are proceeding\r\nvery slowly. Sometimes it seems as if the Organization is\r\ncontinuing to live by the inertia of the old mentality,\r\nwhich does not allow it to use its potential effectively and\r\nmakes it appeal to other organizations for help. Besides,\r\nwe consider that most of the problems the United Nations\r\nis facing in the former Yugoslavia are rooted in the non-\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nobservance of at least a number of the major established\r\nprinciples of peace-keeping.\r\nIn particular, this may apply to the principle of\r\nimpartiality. Thus, a review of the discussions in the\r\nSecurity Council and the activities of the Contact Group\r\ndoes not, unfortunately, give a sufficient basis for talking\r\nabout real political impartiality in the positions of some of\r\ntheir members in regard to all parties to the post-Yugoslav\r\nconflict. As a result, international public opinion bases itself\r\non a policy of dual standards and biased assessments and\r\ndecisions, and this does not enhance the credibility of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is universally recognized that success in the final\r\nsettlement of any conflict depends on the will of the\r\nbelligerents and their readiness to engage in a dialogue and\r\ninternational mediation. At the same time, the consent of\r\nthe conflicting parties to facilitate United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping efforts was not always given. The taking of peace-\r\nkeepers hostage by parties to the conflict in the former\r\nYugoslavia makes us think seriously of the need to\r\nestablish a comprehensive mechanism for the use of force\r\nand to enhance the protection of United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping personnel. In this connection, Ukraine, which\r\ninitiated the elaboration of the Convention on the Safety of\r\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel, calls upon all\r\ncountries to expedite the ratification of this document.\r\nAt the same time, in spite of all the unprecedented\r\ndifficulties and some miscalculations in conducting United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nwe find it necessary to keep United Nations forces there.\r\nAccordingly, we should continue to seek means to bring\r\nabout a peaceful settlement of the conflict. It seems that\r\ntoday everyone agrees that there is no alternative to a\r\npolitical settlement. We welcome efforts in that direction,\r\nparticularly the recent intensification of relevant activities\r\nby the United States. We also believe that Russia can play\r\na greater and constructive role in a peaceful settlement. For\r\nits part, Ukraine, as a major contributor to the United\r\nNations Protection Force, is ready to continue its\r\ncooperation with the United Nations in this field. I would\r\nlike to confirm that Kiev is ready, if necessary, to host a\r\nmeeting of the leaders of the parties to the conflict with the\r\nparticipation of all the countries and international\r\norganizations concerned. The President of Ukraine, Leonid\r\nKuchma, has sent letters with appropriate proposals to the\r\nleaders of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe process of settling the Yugoslav conflict could, in\r\nour opinion, be intensified by expanding the composition of\r\nthe Contact Group and studying new approaches. As an\r\nexample to follow, we note the international meeting on\r\nBosnia held on 21 July in London, in which the\r\ndelegation of Ukraine also took part.\r\nWhile highly appreciating the considerable personal\r\ncontribution of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali\r\nto the philosophy of peace-keeping, we consider that new\r\napproaches in this field require further practical\r\ndevelopment, in particular the principle of utilizing the\r\nrapid reaction force, which has already been quite actively\r\ninvolved in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe question of implementing the idea of\r\nestablishing a United Nations stand-by force, in which\r\nUkraine is ready to participate, is still outstanding.\r\nWe consider preventive diplomacy, which has\r\ndemonstrated its potential in the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, to be one of the priority trends in\r\nthe development of United Nations peace-keeping\r\nactivities. In this context we are again proposing\r\nconsideration of the establishment within the United\r\nNations, and specifically within the Office of the\r\nSecretary-General, of a standing council of international\r\nmediators, whose membership would include\r\ninternationally recognized and authoritative political\r\nfigures.\r\nEconomic sanctions continue to be an important\r\ninstrument in United Nations conflict-settlement activities.\r\nIn this field, we believe it is necessary to elaborate a\r\ncomprehensive and detailed mechanism for the\r\nimplementation of sanctions which would also take into\r\nconsideration all their potential consequences, including\r\nthe negative impact on third countries. In our opinion, it\r\nhas now been demonstrated that the embargo regime\r\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is\r\ncounterproductive and has not attained the main objective\r\nof promoting peaceful settlement of the conflict. Ukraine\r\nconsiders that, along with the process of further political\r\nsettlement, the Security Council should lift economic\r\nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nwhich, in real terms, has already demonstrated its\r\nwillingness to assist in the restoration of peace. At the\r\nsame time, we proceed from the premise that mutual and\r\nsimultaneous recognition of the States that emerged in the\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia should be an important\r\ncondition for the lifting of sanctions.\r\nThe principle that no single State or regional\r\norganization can be granted the right to be the main\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nguarantor of peace and security in one region or another\r\nshould continue to be a cornerstone of United Nations\r\nconflict-prevention and crisis-management activities.\r\nAmong the international community’s undertakings in\r\nthe past year we could list many important achievements\r\nwhich have become our common gains. Today, in\r\nWashington, the ceremony for the signing of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian agreement is taking place, and we want to\r\ncongratulate sincerely both parties and all those who\r\ncontributed to this achievement.\r\nI would also like to dwell on one accomplishment\r\nwhich has significance for our country. The Conference on\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) was undoubtedly the main event since the last\r\nsession in the field of arms control and disarmament. It is\r\nsymbolic that this Conference took place within these walls.\r\nIts decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty is\r\nreally a historic achievement. I do not think it would be\r\ngoing too far to say that Ukraine’s accession to the NPT as\r\na non-nuclear weapon State, and our ratification of the\r\nSTART-1 Treaty and its entry into force played a\r\nsubstantive role in making this event a reality. Thus,\r\nUkraine made its tangible contribution to the global\r\ncause — freeing mankind from the most dangerous\r\nweapons of mass destruction. The voluntary renunciation by\r\nthe third largest nuclear State of this monster of the\r\ntwentieth century is unprecedented.\r\nThe NPT is undoubtedly a key treaty among all the\r\nexisting treaties on arms control and disarmament, since it\r\nprovides an opportunity to consistently coordinate policies\r\nin the field of nuclear disarmament, allowing non-nuclear\r\nStates to conduct a dialogue as equals with nuclear States.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to emphasize that in\r\nUkraine’s opinion, in spite of the record-breaking number\r\nof NPT participants — 179 countries — we cannot regard\r\na situation as stable when States that build their security on\r\nthe possession of nuclear weapons and States that have\r\nnever had or have renounced them exist alongside each\r\nother.\r\nIn this connection, Ukraine attaches great importance\r\nto the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test-ban\r\ntreaty. Unfortunately, the world community has not\r\nmanaged to mark the UN’s fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations by concluding this treaty, but we share the\r\nhopes that the relevant talks will be successfully completed\r\nno later than 1996. In this context the necessity for all\r\ncountries to observe the moratorium on nuclear tests is of\r\nspecial importance. Recent nuclear tests have aroused\r\njustifiable concern in the world. Such actions are not\r\nconducive to enhancing the favourable international\r\nclimate that emerged after the end of the cold war.\r\nThe huge existing arsenals of conventional weapons\r\nand the danger they constitute for mankind put these\r\nweapons on a par with weapons of mass destruction and\r\nrequire the same close attention. As of today, Ukraine is\r\nfulfilling its obligations under the Treaty on Conventional\r\nArmed Forces in Europe. To support the initiative\r\nadvanced by the General Assembly, the Government of\r\nUkraine has declared a moratorium on the export of anti-\r\npersonnel mines.\r\nThe course of the development of history has vividly\r\ndemonstrated the interconnection and interdependence\r\nbetween the safeguarding of peace and security and\r\neconomic and social development. In spite of significant\r\nachievements in this field, the present-day picture of the\r\nworld is far from being ideal. Problems of unemployment,\r\nunderdevelopment, poverty, social disintegration and\r\nisolation require urgent solutions. These problems are\r\nespecially acute for economies in transition that are\r\ncarrying out fundamental reforms.\r\nUkraine, which inherited a heavy burden of problems\r\nfrom the former USSR, is undergoing a painful period of\r\nradical political and economic transformation. Having laid\r\nthe basic foundations of a democratic political system and\r\ncivil society over the past four years, Ukraine has entered\r\na new stage of development. Last October, the President\r\nof Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, proclaimed a new economic\r\npolicy based on the implementation of fundamental\r\neconomic reform. Now, our main efforts are aimed at the\r\nfurther strengthening of democratic foundations, the\r\ncreation of a socially oriented market economy, and the\r\nimplementation of an open, predictable and consistent\r\nforeign policy. The reform of the State system of division\r\nof power is continuing. In contrast to most post-Soviet\r\ncountries, we managed, without violent confrontation, to\r\nfind a way out of the constitutional impasse. The\r\nimportant stage is ahead, namely the final drafting and the\r\nadoption of a new Constitution of Ukraine. A diversified\r\nsystem of external economic relations is being gradually\r\nestablished. The process of integrating the national\r\neconomy into the world economic space is being\r\nintensified.\r\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian economy continues\r\nto suffer from a crisis phenomenon. Having charted a\r\ncourse toward market reform and its rapid\r\nimplementation, Ukraine must seek its own national\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nmodel of market transformation. Today the establishment of\r\nan effective system of social protection is the Government’s\r\nprincipal and most topical task.\r\nThe most important priority for President Kuchma and\r\nthe Government of Ukraine continues to be the preservation\r\nof civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony in the country. In\r\nits four years of independence, Ukraine has managed to\r\nsettle confrontational situations by peaceful political means.\r\nUkraine’s achievements in the field of securing the rights\r\nof national minorities are especially evident against the\r\nbackground of the numerous conflicts that unfortunately\r\ncontinue to be a reality in the territory of the former Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\nUkraine’s national legislation in this sphere has earned\r\nit high international marks, specifically from such\r\nauthoritative organizations as the Council of Europe, of\r\nwhich Ukraine hopes to become a member this year. But,\r\nat the same time, we have problems in this sphere,\r\nparticularly with regard to repatriating the deported Crimean\r\nTatar people and representatives of other nationalities.\r\nThe Government of Ukraine has developed a large-\r\nscale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights\r\nof national minorities and indigenous peoples and has\r\nestablished a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea. But\r\nfor Ukraine, which faces conditions of economic crisis and\r\na complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary\r\ninfrastructure, services and mechanisms, the task of\r\naccommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated\r\npersons appears too complicated. Solving these problems\r\nrequires a complex approach: the mobilization and\r\nconsolidation of efforts at the national, regional and broader\r\ninternational levels.\r\nIn its international activities, Ukraine proceeds from\r\nthe premise that stable development is a guarantor of\r\nlasting peace.\r\nAt present, when economic reforms in Ukraine are\r\ngaining momentum, we are especially interested in the\r\nwidening of the activities of the United Nations and of its\r\nspecialized agencies in the social and economic fields,\r\naimed at establishing conditions for the integration of the\r\nUkrainian economy and other economies in transition into\r\nthe world economic space. The United Nations is an\r\nimportant instrument for promoting this process, and we\r\nappreciate the fact that the Members of this Organization\r\nshow a deep understanding of the problems of countries in\r\ntransition, including Ukraine.\r\nWe believe that creating internal preconditions for\r\nUkraine’s steady and gradual development has an\r\ninternational dimension as well. Ukraine’s geo-political\r\nsituation transforms its efforts to build an economically\r\nviable State into an important factor in promoting\r\nguaranteed peace, stability and security — including in\r\nthe field of ecology — on the European continent.\r\nIt was this deep understanding of global\r\ninterdependence that dictated, in particular, the political\r\ndecision of President Kuchma to decommission the\r\nChernobyl nuclear-power plant by the year 2000. Next\r\nyear marks the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl\r\ncatastrophe, which not only left deep scars on the lives of\r\nthe present generation of Ukrainians, Belarussians and\r\nRussians, but also has a global perspective. We propose\r\nto declare 1996 the Year of the Commemoration of\r\nChernobyl and to organize special activities under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations. On the eve of this tragic\r\nanniversary, I should like once again to emphasize that\r\nnuclear-safety problems and the decommissioning of\r\nmalfunctioning and outdated industrial nuclear facilities\r\nare critical, and not only for Ukraine. We are convinced\r\nthat the time has come for a practical solution to the\r\nentire series of issues related to the accident, especially in\r\nview of the long-term nature of its aftermath. The sooner\r\nwe invest money in the solution of this problem, the\r\nsooner we will be able to overcome it, with fewer\r\nnegative consequences for humanity. We expect that the\r\ninternational community’s support of Ukraine’s efforts\r\nwill be directed not only at the decommissioning of the\r\nChernobyl power plant but also at solving the whole\r\ncluster of associated economic, social and ecological\r\nproblems. In particular, we would welcome wide\r\ninternational participation in establishing an international\r\nscientific-technological centre in Chernobyl.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to emphasize that\r\nUkraine retains a sense of realism with regard to the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to solve our national\r\nproblems. We do not aim to compete with the less\r\ndeveloped countries for the limited resources of the\r\nUnited Nations development system. We are ready and\r\nwilling to cooperate with all interested partners, and we\r\nrely on the purposeful activity of the international\r\ncommunity aimed at creating favourable conditions for\r\nexpanding the access of Ukrainian exports to the world\r\nmarket. We expect that the World Trade Organization,\r\nwhich Ukraine is ready to join, will play an important\r\nrole in the expansion and diversification of international\r\ntrade and economic relations.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nRecently the financial problems of the United Nations\r\nhave had an acute political resonance. There can be only\r\none conclusion: the existing financial system is incapable of\r\nguaranteeing the effective functioning of the Organization\r\nin the current situation and requires substantial reform.\r\nWe fully understand that the financial crisis of the\r\nUnited Nations has been provoked not only by political and\r\neconomic circumstances but also by the imperfect system\r\nof apportionment of expenses, which is based on outdated\r\nprinciples. Ukraine will actively support the adoption of\r\nprogressive changes to the methods of determining the scale\r\nof assessments and the special scheme of expenses for\r\nfinancing United Nations peace-keeping operations, with the\r\naim of reflecting the principle of capacity to pay.\r\nUkraine’s full participation in United Nations activities\r\nis impeded by its excessive contribution and its existing\r\ndebt for financing United Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe State, which for the benefit of the world community\r\nhas taken political decisions to voluntarily renounce nuclear\r\nweapons and decommission the Chernobyl power plant,\r\nshould be able to concentrate its resources primarily on the\r\nimplementation of those decisions. Ukraine, whose\r\neconomy is undergoing an extremely difficult\r\ntransformation and which is also suffering economic losses\r\nin the billions as a result of its strict compliance with the\r\nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, can\r\nby no means continue to be held hostage to the settlement\r\nof the financial problems of the United Nations.\r\nThe world is changing. The cold-war confrontation\r\nbetween blocs, as well as bloc discipline, has become\r\nhistory. The interdependence of States at the regional and\r\nglobal levels is increasing. Given the nature of modern\r\ninternational problems, we should be ready to face the\r\nchallenges of the new era. We need a strong and effective\r\nUnited Nations. Its renovation should encompass both the\r\nstructure itself and the character of its activities, in\r\naccordance with the requirements of the new epoch. In our\r\nopinion, a number of measures should be taken to\r\ndemocratize the Security Council’s activity, in particular to\r\nincrease the legitimacy of its decisions and the transparency\r\nof its work.\r\nOn the whole, Ukraine supports the activity of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and hopes that the interests of all regional groups,\r\nincluding, I should like to emphasize, the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States, will be taken into consideration during the\r\nreform process. Ukraine also supports the proposals related\r\nto the improvement of the activities of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. It stands for a reduction of the staff and\r\nthe enhancement of the efficiency of the activities of the\r\nSecretariat, and for a reduction in the number of items on\r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to paraphrase a point of\r\ncommon wisdom: when you criticize the reflection in the\r\nmirror, you are criticizing yourself. The United Nations\r\nneeds renovation — so we need to renovate ourselves.\r\nThis Organization will not become more effective and\r\ninstrumental unless its Members show enough eagerness\r\nfor practical efforts. I would not want this Assembly in\r\nthe twenty-first century to listen again to wishful thinking\r\nthat is not backed by our political will and readiness to\r\nwork hard.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea,\r\nMr. Kozo Zoumanigui.\r\nMr. Zoumanigui (Guinea) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is a great pleasure and, indeed, an honour for\r\nme, to convey to the General Assembly the fond greetings\r\nof the people of Guinea, its Government and its President,\r\nGeneral Lansana Conté, at the opening of this session,\r\nwhich so fortuitously coincides with the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nI am very pleased to extend to you, Mr. President,\r\nmy warm congratulations on your brilliant election to the\r\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your election and the outstanding efforts by\r\nyour country, Portugal, within this great family of nations,\r\nare a cause of satisfaction to my delegation. I believe that\r\nwith your experience and your abilities as a great\r\ndiplomat, you will guide our deliberations with great\r\nsuccess.\r\nI would join other delegations in paying a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy of\r\nthe sister Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, whose dynamism and\r\ngreat qualities as a sophisticated diplomat helped us move\r\nforward as our Organization sought answers to the\r\nchallenges facing our world today.\r\nAlso, I would here extend my Government’s\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the enormous amount of work he has\r\ndone and for the resolve and wisdom that he demonstrates\r\nin seeking solutions to all the fundamental issues,\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nparticularly those relating to peace, security, development\r\nand democracy throughout the world.\r\nI should like to congratulate the people of Palau on\r\ntheir admission to membership in the United Nations as the\r\n185th Member State. The presence of their delegation here\r\nwith us confirms once more the universality of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is clear that the last few years of this century are\r\nbeing played out against a background of crisis and\r\nconflict, creating an impression of uncertainty as to the\r\nfuture of the human race. But we must recognize that the\r\ninternational community has made considerable efforts in\r\npreparing global strategies for peace and security\r\nthroughout the world, taking into account the environment,\r\nsustainable development, the emancipation of women and\r\nthe protection of children.\r\nDespite these efforts, many parts of the world, sorely\r\ntried by poverty and backwardness, do not yet have\r\nsufficient food or enough drinking water, education or\r\nmedical care. Civil war and natural disaster continue to\r\nendanger the economies of those same areas, which are\r\nalready afflicted by a widespread world crisis.\r\nEntire nations, such as my own, the Republic of\r\nGuinea, pay a heavy price because of their geographical\r\nlocation. More than 600,000 refugees and displaced persons\r\nfrom Liberia and Sierra Leone are now living in our\r\ncountry. The Republic of Guinea will never abandon its\r\nhumanitarian duty to its Liberian and Sierra Leonean\r\nbrothers, and continues to suffer the consequences of a\r\nfratricidal war which has lasted for six years in one of\r\nthose neighbours and three years in the other.\r\nIt is true that relative calm, showing a clearer desire\r\nfor peace in Liberia, has been noted since the agreements\r\nbetween the factions were signed on 19 August 1995 at\r\nAbuja.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, this new choice of peace\r\nin Liberia also requires a clear-cut effort on the part of the\r\ninternational community. In this connection, one has to\r\nensure better control of weapons flows in the region. The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Guinea is resolved to take\r\naction to that end.\r\nClearly, peace in Liberia will help to unblock the\r\ncrisis in Sierra Leone and to establish in our subregion of\r\nWest Africa an atmosphere of peace, security and lasting\r\nstability, which are all essential to our programme for\r\neconomic integration.\r\nMy Government also welcomes the Lusaka\r\nAgreements and we support all the efforts being made to\r\nimplement those Agreements with a view to ending the\r\ncrisis in Angola. It is our belief that if the political will\r\nshown on both sides is sustained, then the people of\r\nAngola will come to know the peace and stability they\r\nhave yearned for so long and will be able to work for\r\nnational reconstruction and economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nHere we would pay tribute to the joint efforts made\r\nby the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and by the international community for\r\npeace and reconciliation in that brother country.\r\nOn the question of Somalia, my delegation deplores\r\nthe current blockage in the peace process. We would urge\r\nall parties to the conflict to demonstrate wisdom and\r\nmutual understanding with a view to finding a peaceful\r\nsettlement to the crisis.\r\nTurning to Rwanda and Burundi, my delegation\r\nbelieves that to encourage major efforts by the\r\ninternational community, those involved in those societies\r\nmust triumph over hatred, cultivate a spirit of forgiveness\r\nand promote love and dialogue.\r\nToday, the conflict in the Middle East is on a\r\npositive footing. In this regard, the advent of Palestinian\r\nautonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, continuing\r\nnegotiations for extending that autonomy to territories still\r\nunder occupation, the Jordanian-Israeli agreement on\r\nborders and the Israeli-Syrian talks on the Golan are all\r\nsignificant advances that augur well for a comprehensive,\r\njust and lasting settlement of the question.\r\nUnited Nations resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir,\r\non recognition of the border between Iraq and Kuwait and\r\non the situation in Afghanistan should, we believe, benefit\r\nfrom mutual understanding between those involved. The\r\nsame holds true for the question of Western Sahara.\r\nIn the Korean peninsula, we are pleased to see an\r\neasing of tension. My delegation would encourage the\r\nNorth and the South to pursue their efforts towards the\r\nindependent and peaceful reunification of their country\r\ninto a confederated republic in keeping with the principle\r\nof one State, one nation, two regimes and two\r\nGovernments. Moreover, my Government is pleased that\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nthe talks between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States of America have led to a\r\nnegotiated solution of the nuclear issue on the peninsula\r\nand to an improvement in the relations between those two\r\ncountries.\r\nIn the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nthe multicultural and ancient civilization, born of the\r\ncontributions of diverse peoples throughout the Balkans, is\r\nbeing jeopardized by human fury. My delegation believes\r\nthat what is happening there, and indeed everywhere,\r\nshould remind the international community of its\r\nresponsibilities for peace and reconciliation among the\r\npeoples and their component groups.\r\nAll the wars that are ravaging entire regions of the\r\nworld today share, along with their countless dead, the\r\nphenomenon of an endless flow of displaced persons\r\nseeking, over mountains and through valleys, a place of\r\nrefuge. Despite the international community’s spirit of\r\nsolidarity, refugees and displaced persons experience the\r\nvery worst deprivations. These days, their problem has\r\ngrown to unprecedented proportions of gravity and\r\ncomplexity. Their numbers have increased from year to\r\nyear, making it ever more difficult to manage the problem\r\nappropriately. In my delegation’s view, the crises that\r\nspawn refugees constitute genuine threats to regional\r\nstability and world peace.\r\nGuinea, which is participating in the United Nations\r\nsecurity mission in the Rwandese refugee camps in Zaire,\r\nin keeping with a framework agreement signed with the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, and taking account of its own experience with\r\nLiberian and Sierra Leonean refugees, believes that no\r\neffort should be spared to calm extremism everywhere. That\r\nis why my Government supports all initiatives to strengthen\r\nthe intervention capacities of the High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees. Guinea also supports the drafting of an agenda\r\nfor humanitarian action along the lines of “An Agenda for\r\nPeace” and “An Agenda for Development”.\r\nDespite the end of the East-West conflict, nuclear\r\nweapons remain the greatest threat to international peace\r\nand security, in spite of the remarkable progress made in\r\nbilateral and multilateral disarmament negotiations. Many\r\ndangers still threaten our efforts to achieve a collective\r\nsecurity that would include the related issues of\r\ndevelopment, environment and human rights.\r\nIn certain key areas, there is an evident and growing\r\ntrend in the trafficking and use of chemical and fissionable\r\nmaterials in conflicts, as well as the hidden or overt\r\ndesire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons.\r\nThese facts represent dangers that increase the\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations, which is called\r\nupon to take rigorous verification measures.\r\nThat is why the Republic of Guinea welcomes the\r\npositive outcome of the New York Conference which led\r\nto the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This was\r\nundeniably an important step towards nuclear\r\ndisarmament and confirmed the special responsibility of\r\nthe nuclear Powers. However, if it is to be effective, this\r\nachievement must be complemented by the immediate\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. All\r\nnuclear tests must be prohibited.\r\nIt is obvious that this quick overview of the major\r\nconcerns of our age — those relating to international\r\nsecurity — amply demonstrate the importance today of\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. My Government\r\ntherefore welcomes the special attention given by the\r\nUnited Nations to the settlement of conflicts in the world.\r\nWe support the relevant views expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General in his Agenda for Peace.\r\nNone the less, while welcoming United Nations\r\ninvolvement in various theatres of operation throughout\r\nthe world, we must also recognize that over the past few\r\nyears the peace-keeping operations have, for the most\r\npart, yielded somewhat meagre results. This requires\r\ntoday, in the light of our experience, a reformulation of\r\nthe entire issue of such operations.\r\nIf they are to be effective, peacemaking and peace-\r\nkeeping operations must be the subject of broader\r\nagreement and dialogue among all the States Members of\r\nthe United Nations, without discrimination. It is in that\r\ncontext that Guinea welcomes the establishment and work\r\nof the mechanism of the Organization of African Unity\r\nfor the prevention, management and settlement of\r\nconflicts in Africa. We urge the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community to give it all the necessary\r\nassistance.\r\nEconomic and social development is a prerequisite\r\nof lasting peace and security. In developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa, a sense of insecurity arises out of\r\nuncertainty in the future. It can thus be easily understood\r\nwhy we often see a collapse of political and social\r\nbalances, leading to civil disorder and ethnic and religious\r\nconflicts.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nDespite United Nations efforts in the economic and\r\nsocial field, the results remain meagre in some regions of\r\nthe world, particularly Africa, which is still deeply affected\r\nby inequality, poverty and other serious problems that often\r\nweaken the social fabric and undermine the foundations of\r\nour States.\r\nRecent trends in the world economy have helped to\r\nworsen this already precarious situation. Thus, the debt\r\nburden remains the main obstacle to development in poor\r\ncountries, forcing them to devote a major share of their\r\nscarce resources to it. The collapse of the prices of\r\ncommodities, which are their main contribution to the world\r\nmarket, has added to their poverty.\r\nOn top of these harsh conditions come the effects of\r\nthe implementation, by some of our States, of structural\r\nadjustment programmes that are sometimes poorly prepared\r\nand often poorly implemented. If all of these various\r\nreforms undertaken by our countries are to bear fruit, all of\r\nthe partners, national and foreign alike, will have to support\r\nAfrica’s development efforts in an effective way. If they\r\nare to be mutually beneficial, the proceeds of all public and\r\nprivate assistance will simply have to take account of\r\neveryone’s respective requirements for well-being.\r\nWithin the framework of the Uruguay Round of the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Guinea welcomes\r\nthe Marrakesh Agreements that gave rise to the World\r\nTrade Organization. Those Agreements will be viable,\r\nhowever, only if they take genuine account of the need to\r\npromote the integration of the African economy into the\r\nworld economy by developing its capacities and making it\r\nmore dynamic. In this connection we strongly support the\r\nidea of setting up a commodities diversification fund.\r\nMy delegation greatly appreciates the special attention\r\ngiven to Africa at the summer session of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council in Geneva, which considered the conditions\r\nfor implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nBilateral initiatives must be supported in order to\r\nstrengthen South-South cooperation on the one hand and to\r\ncontinue the North-South dialogue on the other hand.\r\nMoreover the Agenda for Development must focus\r\nprimarily on Africa, where much of the population lives in\r\npoverty. Implementation of that Agenda, complementing the\r\nAgenda for Peace, will make it possible once again to\r\nmeasure the new political will that has emerged at recent\r\ninternational conferences on social development,\r\npopulation and development, and women.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s Agenda for Development\r\noffers an appropriate framework for North-South dialogue\r\nand it must also enable the United Nations to provide\r\nbetter coordination for, and to make more operational, the\r\npolicies and programmes implemented by its specialized\r\nagencies and institutions, which have had a very limited\r\npositive impact on the economies of developing countries\r\nso far.\r\nIn this connection my Government notes with real\r\ninterest and much hope that the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations will be organizing a\r\nworld summit on food security in November 1996. That\r\nworld-wide meeting will make it possible we believe to\r\nformulate specific and appropriate solutions to the serious\r\neconomic problems facing developing countries.\r\nOf course, all these hopes will be in vain if the\r\nStates of the world are unable to crush drug-trafficking\r\nand abuse.\r\nWhile reconfirming our support for Agenda 21 and\r\nall the agreements on sustainable development, we believe\r\nthat it is only greater political will that will make it\r\npossible to translate into action the decisions that emerge\r\nfrom these various meetings.\r\nAt the Halifax Summit, held from 15 to 17 June last,\r\nthe Group of Seven quite rightly recognized that\r\nsustainable development was one of the major challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century. At that meeting it was also\r\nsaid that better quality of life for all was the objective of\r\nsustainable development, the foundations of which are\r\ndemocracy, human rights, transparent and responsible\r\nmanagement of public affairs, investment in the human\r\nindividual and protection of the environment. Guinea\r\nwelcomes the commitments entered into by the Group of\r\nSeven to support national efforts in this area.\r\nProtecting fundamental human rights, meeting human\r\nneeds, achieving social justice and human development\r\nare still the focus of concern of the Government of\r\nGuinea in its ambitious economic and social reform\r\nprogramme, which has been under way since 1984.\r\nGuinea is party to several international conventions\r\nrelating to human rights because it is firmly committed to\r\npromoting and protecting these fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nToday I am happy to be able to tell the international\r\ncommunity that my country completed instituting its\r\ndemocratic republican institutions in June this year when\r\nwe organized our multiparty legislative and municipal\r\nelections.\r\nThe successful completion of this process of\r\ndemocratization, the establishment of a State of law, and\r\nthe liberalization of the economy in the Republic of Guinea\r\nall benefited from the support and understanding of the\r\ninternational community as a whole and I should like to\r\nthank you all for this.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies, as the\r\nparamount instrument for cooperation and multilateral\r\nagreement, see their responsibilities increased today more\r\nthan ever before. Today this universal Organization has\r\ncertainly acquired a certain prestige. Its help is requested in\r\nevery area.\r\nTo strengthen its effectiveness on this fiftieth\r\nanniversary of its founding, the United Nations must\r\nrestructure and revitalize its principal organs in the light of\r\nthe changes that have taken place in the international arena\r\nand taking account of the challenges facing mankind in the\r\nforthcoming millennium.\r\nThe reforms must be based on the principle of equality\r\namong Member States at the level of decision-making\r\nbodies and also within the various organs.\r\nIt is only in this way that our common heritage, this\r\nirreplaceable tool, this United Nations, will be able\r\nsuccessfully to discharge its mission of preserving\r\ninternational peace and security and promoting a fairer\r\nworld, more equitable and more prosperous world.\r\nThe success of this institution does depend of course\r\non an improvement in its financial situation at a time when\r\nits responsibilities are constantly increasing in this ever-\r\nchanging international situation.\r\nThe United Nations has existed for half a century now.\r\nThe solemn celebration of its first 50 years coincides with\r\nthe twilight of the twentieth century and it offers its 185\r\nMembers an opportunity to try to revitalize its activities and\r\nto agree on equitable representation within its principal\r\norgans. In Guinea commemoration of this historic event is\r\ntaking place with the full support of our Government.\r\nMay the decades to come bring greater\r\nunderstanding among people and among nations so as to\r\nensure the greater happiness of mankind.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Malta, and former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency, the Honourable\r\nProfessor Guido de Marco.\r\nMr. de Marco (Malta): It is with great pleasure that\r\nI congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. You bring to\r\nthe Assembly the wealth of your personal, political and\r\nacademic experience and the positive contribution which\r\nPortugal has given to the work of the Organization\r\nthroughout its 40 years of membership. At the dawn of\r\ndemocracy in your country, yours was a determining\r\ncontribution towards freedom based on fundamental\r\nhuman rights and a State built on the rule of law. Your\r\ncommitment to these principles required no mean measure\r\nof moral and physical courage.\r\nMay I join other speakers in saluting the Foreign\r\nMinister of Côte d’Ivoire, Mr. Amara Essy, who skilfully\r\nled the forty-ninth session and continued to promote the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly within a broader\r\nframework of strengthening the United Nations system.\r\nIt is with great pleasure that we are convinced that,\r\nunder your able leadership, Mr. President, Member States\r\nwill continue to strive to ensure that this Assembly\r\nreflects with immediacy and with clarity that which the\r\nworld community desires of the United Nations.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace through the\r\nadvancement of social progress and better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom for all was 50 years ago, and\r\nremains today, the onerous but vital mission entrusted to\r\nthis Organization by the peoples of the United Nations. In\r\nlooking back at the past 50 years, we must exercise\r\nrealistic restraint. It would be a mistake to recall only\r\nthose instances when our efforts were crowned with\r\nsuccess. It would be equally erroneous if we were to\r\njudge the efficacy of the United Nations by highlighting\r\nonly those complex instances when results failed to do\r\njustice to our collective will and endeavour.\r\nThe determination to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war was what inspired nations and\r\nbrought them together to form this Organization towards\r\nthe end of the Second World War. We have managed to\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\navoid a global conflict. This is in itself a great achievement,\r\none that inspires hope and confidence. Yet realistic restraint\r\nis particularly called for at this moment. Grief still echoes\r\nover the explosions of cannon fire aimed at villages and\r\ncities under siege.\r\nDuring its first 45 years the United Nations was held\r\nhostage to the prevailing cold war logic. Yet even during\r\nthose years, when world peace was strapped to the\r\nterrifying balance of nuclear destructive potential, there\r\nwere moments of great significance.\r\nThe process of decolonization, even if there was\r\nsuffering at times, remains a peak achievement in\r\nhumankind’s history during the twentieth century. It\r\nreaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity\r\nand worth of the human person and in the equal rights of\r\nmen and women and of nations large and small. That\r\nprocess paved the way for the achievement of independence\r\nby peoples spread around the globe, who today are\r\nrepresented in this Hall as sovereign nations.\r\nThe five years since the end of the cold war have\r\nwitnessed a world community subjected to the most intense\r\nperiods of instability. High expectations violently oscillated\r\nwith the doldrums of despair; the exuberant relief of\r\npeoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated\r\nwith the miserable anguish of occupation and “ethnic\r\ncleansing”; rays of hope were paralleled by violent\r\nexplosions of civil strife; nuclear non-proliferation was\r\ncountered by a devastating spread in the traffic in\r\nconventional weaponry; peace for some was matched by\r\nwanton slaughter for others. Never have mankind’s\r\naspirations been so great, yet never have they been so\r\nformidably challenged.\r\nSuch events cannot but impact on our concept of\r\nsecurity. The primary mandate of the United Nations is\r\n“To maintain international peace ..., and to that\r\nend: to take effective collective measures for the\r\nprevention and removal of threats to the peace”.\r\nHow can we ensure and implement this commission?\r\nFive years ago, in the General Assembly, I had the\r\nhonour of calling on the United Nations to implement the\r\nprovisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter with regard to\r\nregional arrangements. Later, at the Helsinki follow-up\r\nmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE), Malta proposed that the CSCE declare\r\nitself a regional arrangement, in terms of Chapter VIII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter — which it did.\r\nIt is still too early to assess the impact and full\r\npotential of that development, particularly in view of the\r\ncomplex situations that already existed and continued to\r\ndevelop in the CSCE region. However, we are convinced\r\nthat the future ability and effectiveness of the United\r\nNations in containing, addressing and resolving situations\r\nof conflict is dependent on the creation and consolidation\r\nof such regional arrangements.\r\nThe world has witnessed communities rediscover the\r\noldest recipes for the generation of human misery. Most\r\nof us believed that tolerance was universally embraced,\r\nthat it was strong enough to have imbued the manner in\r\nwhich we view elements that give nations and ethnic and\r\nreligious groups their rightful identity. The abuse of these\r\nelements as a platform and weapon of war cannot but\r\ninstil in us determination to consolidate structures that\r\npromote a permanent confidence-building dialogue.\r\nDuring the darkest hours of the cold war the CSCE\r\nlearnt that confidence-building was the most effective\r\nguarantee in the promotion of a wider concept of security.\r\nThat conviction remains as we seek to identify the\r\nsupporting structures for a European security architecture.\r\nThe broad elements of the emerging European security\r\narchitecture are already in place.\r\nOn one hand, the CSCE, now changed into the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), is transmuting the notion of confidence- and\r\nsecurity-building from a remedial measure of the age of\r\nantagonism to a tool of partnership in the new\r\ninternational environment.\r\nOn the other hand, the enlarging European Union, of\r\nwhich Malta expects to become full member in the near\r\nfuture, provides a unique and ever-deepening dimension\r\nof the process of regional cooperation. Malta has always\r\nseen membership of the European Union in terms that\r\nencompass not only economic but also much broader\r\npolitical dimensions. In this spirit, membership of the\r\nUnion constitutes for us both the natural culmination of\r\nour significant economic and social development of recent\r\nyears and — more important — the opportunity to\r\nparticipate in a collective endeavour that consolidates\r\nunion within Europe and stability within the region,\r\nthereby providing a solid anchorage for those fundamental\r\nvalues of democracy, the rule of law and the observance\r\nof human rights to which we are deeply attached.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nComprehensive security is distinct from notions of\r\ndefence. It is much wider in scope. It is more appropriate\r\nfor treating issues not necessarily or immediately linked\r\nwith a military threat or outbreak of conflict.\r\nComprehensive regional security structures could be the\r\nmost effective instruments for identifying, analysing and\r\ncontaining the original root causes of potential conflict.\r\nSuch regional arrangements cannot operate in\r\nisolation. They must take into account the work of other\r\ninternational mechanisms that help signal developments\r\nwhich, in the short or long term, could destabilize regional\r\nor international security. Early-warning systems are an\r\nessential ingredient for success.\r\nTo save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar we must cultivate and nurture stability. Equilibrium in\r\nthe socio-political environment cannot be ensured through\r\nsuppression or imposition. It requires the development of\r\neffective rapid-response mechanisms to tackle problem\r\nareas that generate instability. A multifaceted approach\r\ndemonstrates an awareness of the manner in which different\r\nissues, if left unattended or unresolved, fester and spread to\r\nthreaten society.\r\nWeaving such vital areas as human rights, fundamental\r\nfreedoms and social justice into the broader network of\r\ncomprehensive security is the foundation for the launching\r\nof stability pacts which give peoples and nations the\r\nreassurance of peace, dignity and freedom.\r\nIn this respect Malta has been active in promoting\r\nsecurity and cooperation in the Mediterranean. The\r\nobstacles are enormous, but the perils that threaten to\r\ntransform this historic middle-sea into a permanent lake of\r\ninstability are even greater.\r\nThough aware of the difficulties in the way of its final\r\nimplementation, we have supported the idea of a conference\r\non security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, and\r\nwithin this concept of stability in the Mediterranean we\r\nhave ourselves proposed two distinct but correlated ideas,\r\nnamely, that of a council of the Mediterranean and a\r\nstability pact for the Mediterranean. Both are based on the\r\nnotion of dialogue in that region of turbulence.\r\nThe setting up of a council of the Mediterranean\r\nthrough an association of Mediterranean States at the level\r\nof Ministers of Foreign Affairs would facilitate cooperation\r\nat the highest political level. A parliamentary dimension to\r\nthat association further enhances this joint action and\r\nensures a wider spectrum of participation by the elected\r\nrepresentatives in the identification and solution of\r\nproblem areas of common concern.\r\nThe measured success of the Stability Pact for\r\nEurope, first launched by France, has underlined the need\r\nfor applying this notion to the Mediterranean region itself.\r\nWith this in mind, at the concluding conference on the\r\nStability Pact for Europe, Malta launched the concept of\r\na stability pact for the Mediterranean based on the round-\r\ntable system and not only bringing together parties to\r\ndisputes but also making possible the discussion of issues\r\nwhich can serve to pre-empt the development of new\r\nthreats to the security of peoples and States in the region.\r\nThe generally positive reception which this notion has\r\nencountered encourages us to pursue its development\r\nfurther.\r\nMalta welcomes the holding of a Euro-\r\nMediterranean Ministerial Conference at Barcelona in\r\nNovember to consider future economic and political\r\nrelations as a milestone in the consolidation of regional\r\ncooperation. The Mediterranean’s wealth lies in its\r\nheritage of cultural, religious and social diversity. A\r\nforced mutation of this rich mosaic into uniformity would\r\nbe destabilizing. Confidence-building and mutual\r\nunderstanding create the route that leads to security and\r\ncooperation. We must walk that arduous path. Within\r\nmulticultural diversity we must discover the common\r\nvalues that help foster dialogue. This requires shedding\r\npreconceived notions. It requires strong political will. It\r\nrequires that we supplant instinctive mistrust with a spirit\r\nof mutual respect.\r\nThe key protagonists in the Middle East crisis have\r\ndemonstrated how political will and dialogue can\r\novercome obstacles that for decades appeared\r\ninsurmountable. We have supported the peace process and\r\nwill continue to support it, and we welcome the official\r\nsigning in Washington today of the agreements reached\r\nlast Sunday in Taba, Egypt, by Chairman Arafat and\r\nForeign Minister Shimon Peres on behalf of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, respectively. A\r\njust and long-lasting peace in the Middle East requires a\r\nsolution that takes into account both the right of peoples\r\nto self-determination and the right of States to secure\r\nboundaries. May this process of dialogue inspire others\r\nwho still resist this unique human tool of conflict\r\nresolution.\r\nIn particular, we are deeply concerned that the\r\ndivision of Cyprus has so far remained impervious to the\r\nefforts of the international community, especially those of\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nthe Secretary-General, to find a just and lasting peaceful\r\nsolution. We predict that persistent efforts in this regard\r\nwill eventually prevail.\r\nThe Mediterranean process is of great significance to\r\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. The time that\r\nthe United Nations has dedicated over the years to defusing\r\nand resolving issues which threaten peace in the region\r\nillustrates the weight which we attach to the spill-over\r\npotential of current crises. More important, however, is the\r\nfact that a successful Mediterranean process could inspire\r\npatterns of cooperation in other areas characterized by\r\nmulticultural diversity.\r\nImportant as it is to create forums that make it easier\r\nfor political leaders to enter into dialogue on and identify\r\ncommon strategies, the essential ingredient for long-term\r\nstability, is the building of peace in the minds of all women\r\nand men. The United Nations and its agencies have had a\r\nmajor role in the effort to identify common strategies for\r\nfuture achievements built on knowledge of and respect for\r\nthe multicultural diversity of the world community.\r\nDuring the past 12 months three world conferences\r\nhave touched on the most crucial aspects of human rights\r\nand freedoms, the dignity of the human person and the right\r\nof all peoples to development. At Cairo, Copenhagen and\r\nBeijing we worked together, conscious of our cultural\r\ndifferences, yet aware that diversity need not and must not\r\nimpede our common endeavours if we are mindful of our\r\ncommon heritage, our common concern and our common\r\ninterest.\r\nThis respect for multicultural identities has been\r\nevident in the commitments undertaken by States and in the\r\nprinciples which inspire the platforms of action. It must\r\nremain ever-present in the mind of all United Nations\r\nofficials entrusted with its implementation.\r\nOne other area in which the United Nations has\r\ntraditionally been very active is that of arms control and\r\ndisarmament. Over the past 12 months the international\r\ncommunity has had the satisfaction of seeing a successful\r\nconclusion to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference, with the\r\nagreement on the indefinite extension of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime. Malta is proud to have taken an\r\nactive role in helping to bring about this agreement.\r\nWe now look forward to an early agreement on the\r\ncomprehensive ban on the testing of all nuclear weapons.\r\nWe urge all countries, in particular the nuclear States, to\r\ntake all possible measures to ensure a successful\r\nconclusion, during the coming 12 months, of the\r\nnegotiations which have been taking place within the\r\nConference on Disarmament since 1994.\r\nAnniversaries encourage us to drink from the\r\noriginal source for inspiration. The United Nations\r\nCharter was forged at a time when the struggle against a\r\ntotalitarian world vision was nearly complete. The horrors\r\nof war were still tangible, but so also was the fear of\r\nwhat could have been the fate of humankind had a\r\ntotalitarian vision prevailed.\r\nThe Charter established within its principal organs a\r\ndelicate balance based on the equal rights of nations, large\r\nand small, and a pragmatic awareness of the particular\r\nrole which certain States had in ensuring international\r\npeace and security.\r\nDuring the past five years we have assisted in an\r\nintense discussion among Member States on whether or\r\nnot there exists the need to evolve, reform or restructure\r\nthe principal organs of the Charter. I am personally\r\nhonoured to have been the first President of the General\r\nAssembly to chair such a discussion within the\r\nOrganization and to make a presidential motion on this\r\nmatter approved by the Assembly which ensured\r\ncontinuity. This process was later to give fruit in the\r\nformation of the Working Groups which examined the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and are still\r\nstudying the different options relative to the restructuring\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nIn this ongoing process of review and evaluation, we\r\nhave failed to take into account the future of the\r\nTrusteeship Council. Aware that the Trusteeship Council\r\nhad nearly completed its responsibilities for the Trust\r\nTerritories for which it was responsible, five years ago I\r\nproposed to the General Assembly a new, additional\r\nrole — that of trustee of the different areas of common\r\nheritage. It is because of the uncertainty as to the future\r\nof the Council and the diverse opinions on this matter that\r\nwe have requested the inclusion of an item on the agenda\r\nof the General Assembly at its fiftieth session entitled\r\n“Review of the role of the Trusteeship Council”.\r\nWe are confident that when the item is discussed by\r\nthe Assembly — first in plenary and later within the Sixth\r\nCommittee — Member States will bring and share their\r\nviews with that same openness and frankness that have\r\ncharacterized the discussion of the other two principal\r\norgans. Naturally we shall, on that occasion, expound\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nfurther our ideas on how the Trusteeship Council could\r\nevolve.\r\nThere is one aspect which I consider it opportune to\r\nunderline at this stage: the notion of the United Nations as\r\na trustee. The notion that the Charter envisages is unique to\r\nthe Trusteeship Council. It is a notion which, at the time,\r\nwas immediately explicable and applicable to the Territories\r\nplaced under its care. Today, in a world that has become a\r\nglobal community, we are aware that the different areas of\r\ncommon heritage protected by convention require\r\ncoordination by a trustee.\r\nTo avoid fragmentation, dispersal or duplication of\r\neffort in areas which are our common heritage, our\r\ncommon concern and our common interest, we should\r\nexplore the manner in which this principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations can evolve that notion of trust, which was\r\nits major premise, to meet our present-day needs, an\r\nevolution that ensures that the Trusteeship Council holds in\r\nsacred trust the common heritage of humankind and acts as\r\na guardian of the interests of future generations.\r\nDuring the past months we have all invested much\r\ntime and energy in generating public awareness on the\r\nimportance of the fiftieth anniversary. The peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations are sensitive to what we do and decide in\r\nthis forum, not out of mere curiosity or an interest in\r\ninternational affairs, but because the decisions we take have\r\na direct bearing on their personal lives. They did so in the\r\npast, when decolonization brought sovereignty to States and\r\nfreedom to many millions. They do so at present, when the\r\nUnited Nations and its blue insignia represent the last\r\nbeacon of hope for those terrorized by the brutality of war,\r\nfamine or disease. Likewise, our decisions have a bearing\r\non the lives of those who serve the Organization in the\r\nfield, on the fate of the families of peace-keepers killed in\r\nUnited Nations operations and all those of whom we expect\r\nsacrifice to ensure the success of sanctions.\r\nWe pay a special tribute to all United Nations peace-\r\nkeepers, and in particular those killed while on mission.\r\nTheir dedication to duty, humanitarian concern and peace\r\nis honoured by the whole international community.\r\nOur deliberations this year have a particular\r\nsignificance. On them hinge the hopes of millions. As we\r\ntake decisions, may we continue to be inspired by that\r\ncommitment to the maintenance of international peace, the\r\nadvancement of social progress and better standards of life\r\nin larger freedom for all peoples, which is the platform of\r\naction set forth in the Charter. Only then will we rightfully\r\ndeserve to be regarded as trustees of the common\r\nconcerns, common interests and common heritage which\r\nthe peoples of the United Nations have charged to our\r\ncare.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Kazakstan, His Excellency Mr.\r\nKassymjomart Tokaev.\r\nMr. Tokaev (Kazakstan): Please accept my\r\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. This attests to\r\nyour excellent qualities, which will undoubtedly\r\ncontribute to the successful discussion of all the items on\r\nthe agenda.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nspecial appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his great contribution to the solution of\r\ninternational problems of the world community and his\r\nefficient management aimed at the establishment of new\r\nrelations between nations in the twenty-first century.\r\nWe have to note that this anniversary session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time of increased\r\ntension and continued armed conflicts in different parts of\r\nthe globe. One of the most dangerous and complicated is\r\nthe Bosnian conflict. Events in Bosnia defy\r\nstraightforward interpretation. At the same time, the\r\nreadiness recently displayed by the parties in conflict to\r\nsettle existing problems on the basis of adherence to the\r\nprinciples of State sovereignty inspires optimism and hope\r\nthat long-awaited peace will be established in the Balkans.\r\nIn Kazakstan’s opinion one of the most important\r\nconditions for achieving peace is that respective countries\r\nin the territory of the former Yugoslavia continue to exist\r\nas sovereign States within the borders recognized by the\r\nworld community.\r\nWe highly appreciate the role of the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping forces, which in differing situations have\r\ndone their best to contain conflicts and alleviate the\r\nconsequences of hostilities for the civilian population. We\r\nhave no doubt that the Organization has to exercise all its\r\nauthority in such situations. The world community should\r\nprovide more effective assistance to the United Nations so\r\nthat it can use its peace-keeping forces in areas of conflict\r\nin a more efficient and timely manner.\r\nCreation of regional and global structures designed\r\nto promote long-lasting peace is an important aspect of\r\ninternational security. The balance of forces, upset after\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nthe end of the cold war, should be restored not through the\r\nestablishment of new military and political alliances but\r\nthrough international treaties and agreements promoting\r\nsecurity and stability and through the establishment and use\r\nof effective mechanisms of preventive diplomacy.\r\nWe view as quite successful the activities of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), whose sphere of responsibility includes not only\r\nEurope but Central Asia as well. A high degree of\r\nefficiency in security matters concerning the Asian and\r\nPacific region is being displayed by the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum.\r\nKazakstan, for its part, continues its work towards the\r\nconvening of a conference on interaction and confidence-\r\nbuilding measures in Asia. The forum’s mandate is being\r\ndrawn up by the Special Working Group. We believe that\r\nall the countries of the Asian continent, despite their\r\nheterogeneity, have an equal interest in durable peace and\r\nstability, which is an important guarantee for their\r\nprogressive movement towards economic prosperity and\r\ninternal stability. Taking this opportunity, I urge all Asian\r\ncountries to contribute to the realization of this idea,\r\nexpressed by President Nazarbayev from the rostrum of this\r\nlofty Organization at the forty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe firmly believe that no matter how strong and\r\neffective the United Nations may be, no matter how\r\ncomprehensive its activities are, security and peace should\r\nbe the backbone of the policy of all countries, irrespective\r\nof their capabilities and regional affiliation. We see that in\r\nthe new geopolitical reality more emphasis is being placed\r\non meeting the various needs of the individual. There is a\r\ngeneral understanding that quick solutions of security and\r\nstability issues cannot and should not take the place of a\r\nlong-term strategy of sustainable development. In other\r\nwords, in today’s world there is an emerging tendency\r\ntowards a gradual transition from national security to\r\nhuman security.\r\nThe Republic of Kazakstan, which used to be a\r\nde facto nuclear-weapon State and now is a nuclear-free\r\nState, is making its contribution to these global\r\ntransformations. The elimination of all existing nuclear\r\nwarheads in Kazakstan’s territory and of the last nuclear\r\ncharge at the already-closed Semipalatinsk nuclear-test site\r\nhas been a highly important step in the fulfilment of\r\nKazakstan’s international obligations.\r\nKazakstan is a consistent advocate of a moratorium\r\non nuclear tests and of a comprehensive test-ban treaty,\r\nwhich should be concluded as soon as possible but not\r\nlater than next year.\r\nAddressing the United Nations Conference on\r\nDisarmament in June 1995 in Geneva, Kazakstan’s\r\nPresident reaffirmed its commitment to the consistent\r\npolicy of the strengthening of international security in its\r\nnew interpretation. The President of Kazakstan stressed\r\nthat various needs of the individual must be met. Indeed,\r\nthe success of the disarmament process is measured today\r\nnot only by the percentage of warheads and delivery\r\nsystems cut but also by the increase in the production of\r\ngoods for the people.\r\nIn the light of the outcome of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit, emerging models of human development should\r\ninclude new concepts for solving educational,\r\nemployment, environmental and health-care problems.\r\nUrgent and effective measures are needed to address a\r\ndangerous growth in unemployment — an especially\r\npressing problem for the economies in transition. We\r\nbelieve that these countries can legitimately expect from\r\nthe United Nations the adoption of special measures\r\npromoting their sustainable development. The priority that\r\nthis matter should be given by the United Nations can be\r\nexplained by a number of factors.\r\nIndeed, modern geo-economic trends reflect the fact\r\nthat in the near future world economic centres in North\r\nAmerica, South-East Asia and Europe will emerge or be\r\nstrengthened. The stability and effectiveness of these\r\ncentres cannot be imagined without their involvement in\r\ntrade and economic relations with the countries of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, which, even taken\r\nseparately, represent significant economic and political\r\nentities capable of filling existing gaps in relations\r\nbetween Europe and Asia, North and South. It is relevant,\r\nfirst of all, in the case of Kazakstan — a major Central\r\nAsian State.\r\nSpeaking of the need to adapt the United Nations\r\nsystem to the new geo-political realities, we think that the\r\npotential of the countries of Central Asia should be taken\r\ninto account. Their capabilities in the formulation of the\r\nstrategies of sustainable development and peace-making\r\nare becoming stronger. Close attention should be paid to\r\nthe impetus for cooperation with the United Nations, in\r\nthe interest of a secure world, that is being served by\r\nthese countries.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nIn this context, I would like to draw attention to\r\nPresident Nazarbayev’s initiative regarding the\r\nestablishment, under the auspices of the United Nations, of\r\na unit of the armed forces of three Central Asian\r\nrepublics — Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. In our\r\nopinion, this would contribute to the strengthening of\r\nsecurity and peace in Central Asia — a region which also\r\nhas its areas of conflict.\r\nIn the opinion of Kazakstan, priority attention in\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the economies\r\nin transition should be paid to the protection of the\r\nenvironment, which is one of the five main dimensions of\r\ndevelopment. In the Central Asian region, the ecological\r\nthreat is one of the most dangerous threats to human\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe think that the world community should pay special\r\nattention to the tragedy of the Aral Sea region. According\r\nto the World Bank, in the next 25 years, the efforts to\r\nrestore an ecological balance in the region will require $50\r\nbillion. Such a project is not feasible without financial\r\nassistance from international organizations. Thus, we are\r\ninterested in the search for new international sources of\r\nfinancing, and support the idea of devising a system of\r\ninternational taxes on arms transfers and transactions,\r\ninvolving currency flows, to achieve global human,\r\nincluding ecological, security.\r\nI would like to say a few words about United Nations\r\nreforms. The position of Kazakstan on this issue is as\r\nfollows. Reforms are necessary, but they should be carried\r\nout with the utmost care, in order to avoid upsetting the\r\nbalance of the whole system of international relations. The\r\nCharter of the United Nations should largely remain as the\r\nbasis and the reference point for the work of the\r\nOrganization, to which there is no alternative in the modern\r\nworld.\r\nMajor changes that have taken place in the world since\r\nthe creation of the United Nations should be reflected in the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council. Kazakstan believes\r\nthat the number of Council members, including the number\r\nof permanent members, could, in principle, be increased.\r\nWe welcome measures taken by the Secretary-General\r\nto reduce expenses related to the activities of the\r\nSecretariat. It is important, in our opinion, that such an\r\nessential body as the International Court of Justice should\r\nalso be adapted to present-day requirements. The idea of\r\nhaving important decisions adopted in an economic security\r\ncouncil appears to be worthy of attention, considering the\r\nneed, in the view of many countries, to reorganize and\r\nrevitalize the Economic and Social Council.\r\nDebates on fundamental United Nations\r\ndocuments — the reports by the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, “An Agenda for\r\nPeace” and “An Agenda for Development” — reveal the\r\nneed for a more detailed analysis of ways to develop\r\nsociety by meeting the social, economic, political and\r\ncultural needs of the individual. We are especially aware\r\nof this now as we celebrate, under the auspices of\r\nUNESCO, the 150th anniversary of Abai, a great Kazak\r\npoet, educator and philosopher, who devoted his life to\r\nthe mutual spiritual and cultural enrichment of nations.\r\nThe desire to jointly solve the issues of “peace and\r\ndevelopment” also lies at the heart of our proposal to set\r\nup a United Nations commission for central Asia — a\r\njoint body of the Economic Commission for Europe\r\n(ECE) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia\r\nand the Pacific (ESCAP). This idea was initially proposed\r\nby the President of the Republic of Kazakstan, Mr. N.\r\nNazarbaev, at the Summit of the member States of the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization in 1993 in Istanbul.\r\nThe common nature of the social, economic and political\r\nobjectives of the countries in the region, on the threshold\r\nof the twenty-first century, determines the need to\r\nestablish regional mechanisms for their attainment and to\r\ncreate appropriate structures. The progress achieved by\r\nthe countries of Central Asia in this regard is reflected by\r\nthe rather effective activities of the OECD, as well as\r\nthose of the economic union between Kazakstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.\r\nSpeaking about the importance of this problem for\r\nthe Central Asian States, I would like to note that,\r\njudging by past experience, the efforts of two important\r\nregional Commissions — ESCAP and ECE — are not\r\nadequately coordinated with regard to this group of\r\ncountries. As a result, the republics of Central Asia are\r\nnot sufficiently involved in their programmes.\r\nAs the United Nations Organization approaches its\r\nfiftieth anniversary, it has great accomplishments to its\r\ncredit in peacemaking and in the strengthening of\r\ninternational security. As a well-known Japanese writer\r\nonce said: only life filled with a workaday routine might\r\nbe worse and more dreadful than a war. Least of all\r\nwould we like to see the United Nations as a structure\r\nwhich mechanically services the demands of mankind on\r\na day-by-day basis. In other words, we do not want to see\r\nthe\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 28 September 1995\r\nUnited Nations as a rigid structure, insensitive to the\r\nprofound changes of our rapidly changing times. The world\r\ncontinues to pin its hopes on the United Nations as a\r\nconcentrated source of wisdom, justice and responsiveness\r\nto the sufferings of mankind. The world appeals to the\r\nUnited Nations to rise above immediate plans and\r\nprogrammes in order to appreciate fully the mosaic of\r\nmodern international relations in all their variety and\r\ndiversity. And we firmly believe that the United Nations\r\nshould adequately respond to the aspirations of all peoples\r\nyearning for peace and tranquillity, aspirations born out of\r\ntheir very existence.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
