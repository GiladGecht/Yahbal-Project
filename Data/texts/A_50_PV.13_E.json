(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Tsaty-Boungou\r\n(Congo) Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Assembly will first hear a statement by the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nMr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Morocco,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdellatif Filali, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Filali (Morocco) (interpretation from Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, I am\r\npleased to extend to the President my sincere\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI am convinced that his diplomatic experience,\r\nexcellent knowledge of international issues, and the many\r\nresponsibilities that were assigned to him will ensure the\r\nsuccess of our work and help us achieve the best results.\r\nI also wish to assure the President that the delegation\r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco will spare no effort in\r\ncooperating with him and in providing every support to\r\nfacilitate his task. I also salute in him the representative\r\nof a country which shares strong ties of friendship,\r\ncooperation and good-neighbourliness with Morocco.\r\nI should like to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\npay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Amara Essy,\r\nfor his excellent conduct of the work of our previous\r\nsession.\r\nI should like also to express my deep appreciation to\r\nMr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali, the Secretary General, for his\r\nuntiring efforts towards the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity and for his constant endeavours in facing up to\r\nthe tremendous responsibilities shouldered by the United\r\nNations as a result of the developments that took place in\r\nthe world over the past few years.\r\nThose efforts of the Secretary-General acquire\r\ngreater importance at a time when our Organization faces\r\nan unprecedented financial crisis.\r\nThis session stands out by the fact that it coincides\r\nwith the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. We may\r\nrecall the day, 50 years ago, which gave rise to hope that\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nwe were embarking on an age of emancipation, liberty,\r\nindependence and the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nThat day heralded, for all humanity, the dawn of a new era\r\nthat was received with joy as it was to be the beginning of\r\na path of dialogue and cooperation that affected an\r\nalternative to violence and confrontation.\r\nThe important changes in international relations\r\nwitnessed by the world over the past few years did usher in\r\na new world situation. However, the fact that, in the new\r\nsituation, the economic interests of the major Powers\r\ncontinued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the\r\ndeveloping countries that a new era of genuine solidarity\r\nbetween the rich and the poor was about to emerge and\r\nserve the legitimate interests of all the members of the\r\ninternational Community.\r\nAs we see it, the economic and social situation in\r\nmost countries of the South gives no cause for hope or\r\noptimism. The gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries is still widening, and the economic, commercial,\r\nand social problems of the developing countries are only\r\nworsening. This has thrown the doors wide open to such\r\nphenomena as extremism, fanaticism and terrorism,\r\nscourges that we must confront and curb.\r\nIn order for us to do so, the world economy has to be\r\nrestructured in the context of genuine cooperation between\r\nall nations and an earnest dialogue in which the rich\r\ncountries would shoulder their full responsibilities towards\r\nthe promotion of an international partnership whose aim\r\nshould be to find viable solutions to this problem that\r\nwould work in favour of men’s moral and material\r\ninterests, wherever they may be: North or South.\r\nWhile we welcome the initiatives taken towards the\r\nrestructuring of the world economy since the ratification of\r\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the\r\nsubsequent inception of the World Trade Organization, and\r\nthe steps taken by numerous developing nations, including\r\nMorocco, to restructure their economies with a view to\r\nintegrating those economies into the world economy, we\r\nbelieve that such initiatives, by themselves, will not be\r\nsufficient to lead to solutions to the economic, trade and\r\nfinancial problems that beset the third world. We hope that\r\nthe World Trade Organization will adequately and fully\r\ndischarge its responsibilities and that it will be provided\r\nwith the necessary means that would make it an effective\r\ntool and enable it to translate into reality the commitments\r\nmade.\r\nWe hope that the current negotiations amongst the\r\nvarious international organizations concerned will lead to\r\nthe desired coordination between monetary, financial and\r\ntrade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine\r\nfoundations for free international trade, wherein there\r\nwould be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any\r\ndecline in the prices of primary commodities. We also\r\nhope that those discussions will mark the beginning of a\r\nreconsideration of the concept of foreign debt from which\r\nthe developing countries suffer.\r\nThe African continent is in the grip of a disastrous\r\neconomic and social situation. Morocco views with\r\nconcern the deterioration of this situation as it is part of\r\nthe African continent, and is a member of the African\r\nfamily that has a long history of shared struggle for\r\nliberation and emancipation which binds it to all the\r\npeoples of Africa.\r\nGiven the gravity of a situation, that portends untold\r\ntragedies, Morocco calls on the international community\r\nto make a concerted effort to find a solution to the\r\nworsening problems of Africa.\r\nIn our opinion, the strategic perspective and the\r\napproach adopted so far in tackling those problems will\r\nnot lead to any improvement or substantial qualitative\r\nchange so long as the international community does not\r\ncommit itself to a long-term strategy that embodies\r\nconcrete commitments in favour of Africa. Such a\r\nstrategy, as we see it, should be part of a comprehensive\r\nperspective aimed at improving the level of social and\r\neconomic development in Africa with a view to\r\nintegrating the continent into the world economy and\r\nenabling it to benefit from its dividends. In this respect,\r\nMorocco calls for a speeding up of the implementation of\r\nthe Convention to combat desertification in order to meet\r\nthe needs of our continent at both the national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nIn spite of the efforts made by the United Nations\r\nand repeated calls from this rostrum to give pride of place\r\nto dialogue, and to solve conflicts by peaceful means and\r\npreventive diplomacy, some regions in the world continue\r\nto be the scene of armed conflicts and civil wars which\r\ncrush our hopes of establishing lasting peace and security.\r\nBy the same token, the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons, still threatens our\r\nworld and should be addressed most earnestly in order to\r\navoid irreparable disasters.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nIn this respect Morocco has effectively contributed to\r\nthe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and hopes that all\r\ncountries will accede to this important Treaty and thereby\r\nensure its universality. Morocco also hopes that the Middle\r\nEast will be exempt from all weapons of mass destruction,\r\nas has been the case for other regions of the world. This is\r\none of the noble objectives that the Organization should\r\nwork for so that all may channel the funds tied up in this\r\nfield to development and to combating all forms of\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nIt is indeed cause for optimism that progress has been\r\nmade in the negotiations on the test-ban treaty, especially\r\nthe pledge made by the Conference on Disarmament to\r\nconclude a treaty concerning this issue before the end of\r\n1996.\r\nThe era of colonialism is now a thing of the past. As\r\na matter of fact, this has been one of the great\r\nachievements of the past 50 years. Unfortunately however,\r\nthe two Moroccan cities of Sebta and Melilia and the\r\nneighbouring islands are still under Spanish occupation.\r\nThese enclaves, which are part and parcel of Moroccan\r\nterritory, and which overlook the Mediterranean sea, are\r\nthus the last remaining colonies in Africa. Such a situation\r\nis indeed a strange anomaly which neither reason nor logic\r\ncan accept and which clashes head on with the spirit and\r\nthe letter of the United Nations Charter.\r\nIn this context, may I recall the major stages which\r\nMorocco has gone through in order to complete its\r\nterritorial integrity. Since its independence in 1956,\r\nMorocco started negotiations with Spain in order to\r\ncomplete its independence, hence the withdrawal, in 1958,\r\nfrom the region of Tarfaya, which is part of the Moroccan\r\nSahara, then the withdrawal from the region of Sidi Ifni in\r\n1969. In 1975, after a period of alternating dialogue and\r\ntension, Morocco recovered its other southern provinces.\r\nThe only parts that are still under Spanish colonization are\r\nSebta and Melilia and the neighbouring islands.\r\nMorocco, which opted for dialogue as a fundamental\r\nprinciple in its policy vis-à-vis its neighbours, propounded\r\nthat principle in international forums as the best means of\r\navoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by\r\npeaceful means, remains convinced that its historical ties\r\nwith Spain, coupled with the two countries’ common\r\neconomic interests, will help overcome the difficulties that\r\nstand in the way of a solution to this dispute.\r\nMorocco considers Spain to be one of its most\r\nimportant economic and political partners in view of the\r\nsize of Spain’s investments in Morocco, the volume of\r\ntrade between the two countries, the joint development\r\nprojects, such as the intercontinental link between Spain\r\nand Morocco that would link the African and European\r\ncontinents, as well as the burgeoning cooperation in the\r\nareas of culture and tourism.\r\nWe are convinced that if all this is taken into\r\naccount, it would help resolve the disputes. We believe\r\nthat the best framework for the desired settlement is to be\r\nfound in the proposal made to Spain by His Majesty King\r\nHassan II, to set up a reflection and consultation\r\ncommittee with the aim of finding a solution to the\r\nproblem of Sebta and Melilia that would allow Morocco\r\nto exercise its sovereignty over the two cities and the\r\nneighbouring islands while preserving Spain’s economic\r\ninterests.\r\nThe Arab Maghreb Union has made considerable\r\nprogress on the road to Maghreb unity. Morocco, which,\r\nlike its neighbours, believes that the Union is a strategic\r\nchoice, is determined to overcome the few remaining\r\nobstacles in the way of progress towards unity. In this era\r\nof economic blocs, the creation of the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion is an unavoidable necessity if regional integration\r\nis to be achieved, if challenges are to be met and if we\r\nare to ensure the progress and prosperity of our peoples,\r\nwho are united by the bonds of common language,\r\nreligion and history.\r\nI am sure that idea of establishing the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion, which reflects an ancient historical reality, will\r\ncome to fruition as have other regional blocs that have\r\nachieved a high level of integration and unity even\r\nwithout enjoying the bonds that unite the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion.\r\nIn recent years, the Middle East has witnessed many\r\ndevelopments that have created an opportunity to achieve\r\npeace and to end the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of\r\nthe principles of land for peace, respect for the national\r\nand political rights of the Palestinian people and the\r\nestablishment of their own State, with Al Quds as its\r\ncapital.\r\nOne of the decisive events in the region was the\r\nconclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement signed at\r\nWashington D.C., which confirmed that the peace process\r\nin the region is irreversible, notwithstanding the obstacles\r\nit is encountering. The Jordanian-Israeli agreement also\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nconfirmed that the logic of tolerance and coexistence in the\r\nframework of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace based\r\non international legality is now an absolute necessity for all.\r\nIn this connection we welcome with satisfaction the\r\nTaba Agreement that was signed in Washington D.C.\r\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis, an important\r\nmilestone on the road towards the establishment of peace\r\nand security in the region. It is our fervent hope that the\r\ntwo parties will be able to overcome existing obstacles and\r\nshow a firm determination to settle pending problems,\r\nbearing in mind the legitimate interests of all and respecting\r\ntheir commitments and the behests of international legality.\r\nOptimistic as we are about the progress on the Israeli-\r\nJordanian and the Israeli-Palestinian tracks, we hope that\r\npositive development will materialize on the Israeli-Syrian\r\nand Israeli-Lebanese tracks which would lead to results\r\nacceptable to all parties on the basis of the relevant\r\nresolutions of the United Nations Security Council and\r\nGeneral Assembly, particularly Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nLast year, in an attempt to promote the peace process\r\nin the region, Morocco acted as host to the very first\r\nEconomic Summit for the Middle East and North Africa,\r\nwhich stressed the need to establish economic programmes\r\nas part of an effective partnership that would create better\r\nliving conditions for the peoples of those regions. The\r\nSummit also emphasized the need to assist economic\r\ndevelopment in Palestine to enable the Palestinian people to\r\npromote their economic and developmental institutions and\r\nto participate on an equal footing in the development of the\r\nregion.\r\nWe hope that the Amman Summit will be another\r\nmilestone in the mobilization of the potential of public and\r\nprivate sectors to consolidate the peace process by\r\npromoting economic cooperation to help in the region’s\r\ndevelopment and by meeting the aspirations of the peoples\r\nof that region after progress, prosperity and just and lasting\r\npeace.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran have not yet arrived at a final settlement of their\r\ndispute over the future of the islands of Abu Musa and\r\nGreater and Lesser Tumbs. In light of our historical\r\nrelations with those two sisterly countries, and given the\r\nrelations of neighbourliness and friendship between the\r\npeoples of the United Arab Emirates and Iran, we look\r\nforward the day when there will be a final solution to this\r\ndispute so that the region may revert to the spirit of\r\ncoexistence that once characterized it.\r\nThe tragedy of the Bosnian people is almost without\r\nprecedent in the history of mankind. It is even more\r\nalarming in light of the international community’s failure\r\nto stand up against murders, displacement of populations,\r\nethnic and religious cleansing, mass rape and the\r\ndestruction of the country’s culture heritage and\r\ncivilization.\r\nIt is regrettable that the world should be witnessing\r\nsuch procrastination under the new world order, which\r\npurports to be founded on respect for human rights. It is\r\nalso somewhat amazing that that new world order, which\r\nhad mustered all its resources to extinguish every hot spot\r\noutside the Western world, should now fail to protect a\r\npeople in the very heart of Europe who are daily being\r\nsubjected to Serb aggression.\r\nMorocco, which had been under the impression that\r\nthe problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be settled\r\nin 1992, was surprised at the deterioration of the situation\r\nthere and by the escalation of violence and massacres. In\r\nthis connection, Morocco has consistently discharged its\r\nhuman and Islamic duty to defend the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, mitigate the agony of the Bosnian people\r\nand provide humanitarian assistance to them.\r\nI am convinced that the meeting of the Islamic and\r\nInternational Contact Groups in Paris on 7 September\r\n1995 and the meeting that took place between the two\r\ngroups yesterday, 28 September 1995, are likely to open\r\nthe way to coordination and consultation to achieve the\r\nexpected objectives and strengthen the foundations for\r\npeace in the region on the basis of justice and\r\ninternational law.\r\nWe welcome with hope the results of the 8\r\nSeptember 1995 meeting between the Bosnian, Serb and\r\nCroat ministers at Geneva.\r\nWe hope that the agreement in principle concluded\r\nby the parties to the conflict last Tuesday, 26 September\r\n1995, in New York will be a decisive step towards\r\nalleviating the sufferings of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and that it will help them achieve their\r\nhopes for peace, tranquillity, sovereignty, safeguard the\r\nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina\r\nand thus ensure peace, reconciliation and stability in the\r\nregion.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nWith regard to the question of the so-called Western\r\nSahara, Morocco took the initiative of proposing the\r\norganization of a referendum and accepted the settlement\r\nplan presented by the Secretary-General. Morocco also\r\nagreed on the criteria concerning voter identification and\r\nmade serious efforts in full cooperation with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Security Council and the United Nations\r\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\r\n(MINURSO). Morocco has also offered financial assistance\r\nand the necessary support to overcome difficulties and\r\nimplement the settlement plan in good faith.\r\nIn view of the obstacles we are now encountering in\r\nconnection with the identification process with regard to all\r\npersons of Saharan origin, we appeal to the Security\r\nCouncil to take the necessary measures and to mobilize all\r\nthe appropriate means that would safeguard the settlement\r\nplan against collapse and remove the spectre of tension\r\nfrom the region.\r\nI take this opportunity to renew our commitment and\r\nstress our firm determination to continue our full\r\ncooperation with the Secretary-General in order to complete\r\nall the procedures and take all necessary measures to\r\norganize the referendum early next year, as suggested by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his latest report to the Security\r\nCouncil on the issue.\r\nWe hope that the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization will be an opportunity to study all the ideas\r\nand suggestions put forth in order to improve and redress\r\nthe structures of our Organization so that, given all the\r\nchanges in the world, it can meet the actual needs of the\r\ninternational community. I refer in particular to ideas\r\nregarding the enlargement of the Security Council and\r\nimprovement of its working methods, which must be\r\ncarefully considered and given ample time so that results\r\ncan be achieved and a consensus can be reached.\r\nWe are confident that the perseverance and earnest\r\ndetermination we have shown in taking up challenges will\r\nbe the best incentive for us to face up to the new challenge\r\nand enable our Organization to fulfil its duties adequately\r\nat the dawning of the twenty-first century, which we hope\r\nwill be the beginning of a new era of peace, stability and\r\nlife in dignity for humanity.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nZambia, His Excellency Mr. Christon Tembo, on whom\r\nI now call.\r\nMr. Tembo (Zambia): On this important occasion,\r\nallow me to extend to the President the congratulations of\r\nthe people and the Government of Zambia upon his well-\r\ndeserved election to preside over the work of the General\r\nAssembly at its fiftieth session. We are confident that his\r\nbroad experience and ability will afford us sure guidance\r\nat this historic session of the General Assembly, which\r\nmarks half a century of the United Nations.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nwho so successfully presided over the session with great\r\nskill and expertise. He leaves the presidency with a record\r\nof successes that has enhanced the Assembly’s\r\ndeliberative role.\r\nMy delegation would also like to put on record its\r\nappreciation for the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has continued to lead the\r\nOrganization with skill and tenacity under trying\r\ncircumstances.\r\nAs we observe and celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the founding of the United Nations, we should also\r\ntake this opportunity to take stock of the Organization’s\r\npast performance, evaluating its achievements and\r\nfailures, and then proceed to map out our future direction.\r\nIt cannot be disputed that the United Nations has\r\nmade outstanding contributions to world peace and\r\nsecurity and the promotion of development throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nThe United Nations has conducted successful peace-\r\nkeeping operations in various parts of the world, including\r\nCambodia, Mozambique, Haiti and, very recently, Angola.\r\nIt is also as a result of United Nations engagement\r\nthat the world is now entering an era in which the ideals\r\nof human rights and democracy are gaining support in\r\nmany countries. The United Nations is on record as\r\nhaving provided electoral assistance to over 40 countries.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nThis has gone a long way in ensuring free and fair\r\nelections.\r\nThe United Nations has been a strong source of relief\r\nfrom human suffering. Through the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\r\nNations has provided food, shelter, medicine and education\r\nfor millions of refugees the world over.\r\nVery recently, in 1990, through the efforts of our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the\r\npersonal dedication to children of the late James Grant, the\r\nWorld Summit for Children was convened here in New\r\nYork, where the Convention on the Rights of the Child was\r\nadopted. This Convention has become the first to receive\r\nuniversal acceptance. This is a remarkable achievement in\r\nitself.\r\nAgainst this background of achievements, the\r\nOrganization has had to deal with many formidable\r\nproblems, such as the super-Power rivalry of the cold-war\r\nera, which resulted in a long period of paralysis in terms of\r\nthe Organization’s ability to take quick and effective\r\ndecisions and in the increasing number of ethnic conflicts\r\nand tensions around the world, as evidenced by conflicts in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and\r\nGeorgia, among others.\r\nThe continued unfavourable international economic\r\nsituation and environmental degradation are serious\r\nchallenges that the United Nations has had to deal with.\r\nZambia is convinced that the United Nations remains\r\nthe only world body with the capacity to galvanize political\r\nwill to face these challenges as we approach the twenty-\r\nfirst century. As a country and Member State, we take this\r\nopportunity to reaffirm and renew our commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is quite clear that the United Nations will require a\r\nrenewed vision for the next 50 years. The agenda to disarm\r\nthroughout the world is not complete. My delegation\r\nstrongly feels that as long as there is continued proliferation\r\nof weapons, there can never be any hope for lasting peace\r\nand security in any corner of the world.\r\nMy delegation, therefore, welcomes the successful\r\nconclusion, early this year, of the Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); the Treaty\r\nwas extended indefinitely. My delegation wishes to express\r\nour grave concern that, soon after the extension, some of\r\nthe signatories to the NPT have resumed nuclear tests.\r\nThis is not in the spirit of nuclear disarmament. We also\r\ncongratulate those that have continued to observe their\r\nmoratoriums and hope that they will not be swayed by\r\nthose that are embarking on nuclear testing.\r\nZambia takes note of the ongoing negotiations in\r\nGeneva on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty\r\n(CTBT), and urges a speedy and successful completion of\r\nthat treaty. We also welcome the efforts to strengthen the\r\nBiological and Toxic Weapons Convention.\r\nHowever, in spite of all these positive developments\r\nin the area of disarmament, there are, of course, other\r\ncritical areas, such as complete and general disarmament,\r\nnuclear technology, nuclear-weapon-free zones, mine\r\nclearance as well as peaceful uses of nuclear energy, that\r\nremain unresolved. We therefore urge all concerned to\r\ngive special attention to such issues, in the hope that this\r\nwill enhance security guarantees.\r\nThe issue of specific concern to southern Africa,\r\nwhich has emerged from a long period of conflict, is land\r\nmine clearance. Many of our people continue to die from\r\nuncleared land mines. Accordingly, we call upon the\r\ninternational community to increase its support for the\r\nregional efforts being carried out through the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community to de-mine the affected\r\nareas in the southern Africa region. In this regard, we\r\nwish to express our appreciation to the European Union,\r\nwhich continues to support our efforts in mine clearance.\r\nIn the area of peace-keeping, Zambia realizes that\r\npursuing peace has not been an easy task for the United\r\nNations and is not likely to be so in the foreseeable\r\nfuture. The Organization needs a clear vision of what\r\nmust be done in each particular case. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Agenda for Peace, we believe, provides that\r\nvision. It is an important agenda, which has already\r\nassisted in many areas of our peace-keeping operations.\r\nWe are aware that a quick and effective response in\r\ntime of conflicts depends on a number of important\r\nfactors, especially the political will by the Member States\r\nto meet resource requirements. In this respect, Zambia\r\nsupports the establishment of a rapid- reaction-capability\r\nforce, which we believe will enhance peace-keeping\r\noperations and save lives.\r\nThe protection, promotion and enjoyment of human\r\nrights is an obligation Governments and peoples the world\r\nover must uphold. The dignity of life cannot be enhanced\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nwithout full observance of human rights. Zambia therefore\r\nbelieves that the United Nations must continue to give high\r\npriority to human rights issues.\r\nIn this regard, Zambia is gratified that the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, recently held in Beijing,\r\nChina, recognized that women’s rights are human rights,\r\nand that Governments committed themselves to the\r\nimplementation of that human rights agenda.\r\nThe Beijing conference and the other recent United\r\nNations conferences — the World Conference on Human\r\nRights, the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the World Social Summit — will all need\r\nactive and integrated follow-up throughout the United\r\nNations system. In this follow-up, the roles of the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council are crucial\r\nnot only for the efficient implementation of the programmes\r\nof action, but also for strengthening the Organization in the\r\nsocial and economic fields. Zambia recognizes the urgent\r\nneed to revitalize the Council’s functions, including\r\nimproved and enhanced utilization of its various functional\r\ncommittees. Harmonization of institutional arrangements in\r\nthe entire United Nations system will need to be undertaken\r\nas a matter of priority.\r\nIn terms of the reform of the Security Council, Zambia\r\nbelieves it is necessary to expand the Security Council to\r\nenable it to become more representative. It is also our view\r\nthat the Security Council needs to become democratic and\r\ntransparent.\r\nZambia would like to see the United Nations give\r\npriority to addressing developmental issues in the new\r\nmillennium. In this regard, I wish to state that Zambia\r\nattaches great importance to the realization of the Agenda\r\nfor Development. Development is a critical area of concern\r\nfor my own continent, Africa, where poverty,\r\nunemployment and social exclusion affect virtually every\r\ncountry. As we approach the twenty-first century, the\r\ninternational community should give added emphasis to the\r\nfight against poverty. By fighting poverty, we can assure\r\nthe progress of individuals, which is essential to the\r\nsustained progress of all nations.\r\nZambia is therefore gratified that the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development committed itself to accelerating the\r\neconomic, social and human resources development of\r\nAfrica and the least developed countries. The World\r\nSummit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen,\r\nDenmark, in March this year, has, through its Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action, challenged Governments the\r\nworld over to create opportunities through employment\r\ngeneration and social integration that should eradicate\r\npoverty. My delegation hopes that Governments will\r\nimplement its Programme of Action.\r\nThe poverty obtaining in many developing countries\r\nis being exacerbated by the onerous debt burdens most of\r\nthese countries have continued to carry since the early\r\n1980s. The Naples terms, with the potential to achieve a\r\n67 per cent debt reduction on either export credits or debt\r\nservice, is only the beginning in offering durable debt\r\nrelief to developing countries, especially with regard to\r\nthose with very high debt service ratios. The creditor\r\ncountries should move beyond modesty and offer terms\r\nthat can in the shortest possible time frame reduce debt\r\nservice ratios of the poorest developing countries to 21\r\nper cent of their export earnings. This is the level\r\nrecognized by the United Nations as the basic minimum\r\nrequirement to ensure that the poorest developing\r\ncountries overcome their debt problems and re-establish\r\ncredit-worthiness. Coupled with the sustained\r\nunderfunding of many structural adjustment programmes,\r\na modest approach on promoting debt reduction can only\r\nhave the ultimate result of undermining opportunities for\r\ngrowth, development and prosperity in developing\r\ncountries.\r\nAs the World Trade Organization begins its\r\nformative years, a new challenge from this institution is\r\nemerging in developing countries that will add to the\r\nchallenges of external debt burdens and poverty. This is\r\nthe challenge of registering early net losses from the new\r\nsystem of multilateral trade as preferences are removed,\r\nfood prices rise, subsidies decrease and commodity\r\nexports continue to face marginalization. This is\r\nespecially pronounced for Africa, which, as we all know,\r\nhas already recorded more than a decade of austerity.\r\nWhile we recognize the long-term opportunities\r\ndeveloping countries will gain from the World Trade\r\nOrganization, it still remains the duty of developed\r\ncountries to make good their pledges reaffirmed at\r\nMarrakesh to compensate net losers in the new system of\r\nmultilateral trade, by quickly specifying the terms of\r\ncompensation.\r\nZambia realizes that establishing the foundations of\r\ninternational competitiveness is the key to getting a\r\nfoothold in the world economy. Our reform measures,\r\nwhich started in 1991, are gaining momentum. The\r\nchallenge now is to move away from concerns over\r\nstabilization and liberalization to the stimulation of\r\nproduction, employment and labour productivity as the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nbasic foundations for poverty reduction. This is being done\r\nat the same time as we are building on complementarities\r\nalready established in the regional integration mechanisms\r\nof the Southern African Development Community and the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, of which\r\nZambia is a member. However, our domestic reform efforts\r\ncan only be sustained by generous debt reduction that\r\nimproves our cash-flow position to levels which regenerate\r\nbusiness confidence in Zambia. The debt overhang remains\r\nthe single biggest barrier to recovery and development in\r\nZambia.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to state that Zambia will\r\nremain actively committed to achieving these priorities in\r\nthe framework of the United Nations. We believe in the\r\nUnited Nations and have every confidence that our\r\nOrganization will lead us into a new era of full of hope and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nVenezuela, His Excellency Mr. Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas.\r\nMr. Burelli Rivas (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Everything that could be said has been said\r\nduring this annual routine, in which each Head of State or\r\nGovernment, or Minister, stands before the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly. If all the speeches were to be published\r\nin a compendium, the same universal themes would be\r\nrepeated a thousand times.\r\nThe compendium would include the great, insoluble\r\nproblems that, to various degrees, afflict the peoples of\r\nevery continent, as well as the solutions that have already\r\nbeen found, and the promised solutions implicit in the\r\nconstant efforts of this Organization, which, like any other\r\nhuman endeavour, has lived through 50 years of triumphs\r\nand frustration.\r\nWe must rejoice that, thanks to the Organization’s\r\nvigilance and action, we have enjoyed — as never\r\nbefore — half a century of peace, although we lament the\r\nfact that we must now deploy efforts against violence born\r\nof intolerance, fanaticism and ethnic or religious strife that\r\nfrustrate the achievement of the harmony for which\r\nmankind yearns.\r\nAlongside the impressive achievements of the world\r\ncommunity, these 50 years have also seen numerous local\r\nconflicts that have taken 23 million lives. Eighty seven per\r\ncent of the weapons sold and used in the world come from\r\nthe five countries that are permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council. And, unbelievable as it might seem, at\r\nthis stage of our political evolution, two atomic Powers\r\nare causing anxiety with inexplicable nuclear tests for\r\nwhich we criticized other Powers.\r\nBut who can deny that in the fields of health,\r\ntechnology, environment, human rights, communications,\r\nthe exploitation of the resources of the seas and many\r\nother fields, there is progress and hope, and at least a\r\nwarning that awakens the universal conscience?\r\nToday’s statement by the Foreign Minister of\r\nVenezuela will be no different. Political scenarios change,\r\nas do ideologies, the most extraordinary crisis in history\r\nerupts, but life’s dramas continue, with man bruised by\r\nchange, but for the first time wavering between hope and\r\nbewilderment. This situation results from the fact that we\r\nhave rushed from one era to another without the\r\ndemolition caused by war, although we have had the\r\nenthusiastic and confident contribution of students and\r\nworkers, who have devoted their free time to making it.\r\nWe note hardly any curiosity about the era we are\r\napproaching, an era as yet unnamed, though soon to be\r\nupon us it could be called anything: “post-capitalist”,\r\n“post-socialist” or “post-industrial”; or it could simply be\r\ndescribed as a time of transition between two periods that\r\nour generations share.\r\nThere has been talk, of course, of the end of history,\r\nwith the end of ideological confrontation; that is precisely\r\nwhat makes history: incessant conflicts and passionate\r\nconfrontations, fears and hopes, freedom and deprivation\r\nof freedom, in any of the forms of oppression that have\r\nalways been applied.\r\nMan today has the vague feeling that he is in contact\r\nwith all other men through the miracle of the media, fibre\r\noptics, and cybernetic systems, and yet, now that there are\r\nmore human beings with whom solidarity may be felt,\r\nsolidarity is more precarious and man’s loneliness is more\r\npoignant.\r\nTo create a different world based on a solid,\r\ncomplex and long-lasting Organization that has been\r\ntaking shape since the end of the First World War, we\r\nhave begun to talk — since we want words to describe\r\nwhat is going on — of globalization, of integration, of the\r\nabolition of the nation-State and its replacement by large\r\nblocs, in order to produce through strength of numbers\r\nand unity a new dynamic different from military might.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nLet us suppose, then, that the world of the future will\r\nhave to be shaped according to regions, or large integrated\r\ngroups or communities, regional or otherwise, that have a\r\ncommon cultural origin and wish to be identified with the\r\nothers, because of the particular characteristics of their\r\nculture, such as tradition, language, religion and even mixed\r\nblood.\r\nThis is what strikes me, as I now appear for the first\r\ntime before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf of\r\na country such as mine — a country with a modest\r\neconomy, a small population, a territory that is\r\nmedium-sized but which, owing to its excellent\r\ngeographical situation, developed more than others; a\r\nculture of social freedom, of mixed races and of political\r\nindependence, achieved by means of an epic struggle, not\r\nonly for itself but for all of its American neighbours. Mine\r\nis a country that has never been at war with anyone, a\r\ncountry whose desire to see its neighbours freed from\r\ncolonialism gave impetus to, and is inspiring, the brand-new\r\nCaribbean community, for instance. It is a country that, as\r\nwe have proved time and again, will support and promote\r\nany initiative aimed at pacification in the region, as we did\r\ntoday in the Group of Friends of Guatemala, for example,\r\nand when we welcomed the latest agreement between Israel\r\nand the Palestinians.\r\nVenezuela, like other countries, has been shaken — in\r\nour case since 1989 — by a severe crisis. Not so much\r\neconomic or political as ethical in nature, this crisis has\r\nweakened our institutions and undermined our financial\r\nsystem, the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of our\r\ngross national product and has attracted the\r\nnot-always-understanding attention of international opinion.\r\nThis is the crisis that our Government inherited.\r\nAware that its characteristics are atypical in our region,\r\nsince its basic goal is to replace a paternalistic, oil-\r\ndependent model by an open culture based on work and\r\nself-reliance rather than on seeking the understanding of\r\nother countries, our Government is proceeding to solve our\r\nnation’s problems, which, fortunately, are no match for our\r\ndiverse and solid economic resources.\r\nVenezuela is a country that has simultaneously — as\r\nif by magic — produced great thinkers, the most credible\r\nUtopians, the luckiest generals, the most visionary\r\neducators. My country, situated at the northern gate of\r\nSouth America, freed itself and other countries by following\r\nthe dreams of Francisco de Miranda, brought to fruition by\r\nSimón Bolivár and Antonio José de Sucre, by systematic\r\nthinking and by the actions of Andrés Bello and Simón\r\nRodríguez, among other well-known figures.\r\nSimón Bolívar was clear-sighted. In that nebulous\r\nperiod of history that was the year 1815, he set out, from\r\nJamaica — in the most famous political document of this\r\npart of the world — a dazzling prophecy of what the\r\nideal destiny of Hispanic America was to be. To this day,\r\nno one can understand how he thought it up. He wrote:\r\n“It is a grandiose idea to try to make of the entire\r\nnew world a single nation, with only one link to\r\nbind and tie together all the parts to the whole.”\r\nOnce independence was achieved, he foresaw that an\r\nimperfect and erratic unity, such as that of the South,\r\ncould be thrown off balance by the organization of the\r\nformer 13 American colonies, whose integration he\r\nalready anticipated. He also foresaw the power of the\r\nhard-working, driven race that would consolidate on the\r\nAmerican continent the formidable and admirable nation\r\nthat the United States has become, with its transcendent\r\nand unique feeling of liberty, since its founders left\r\nbehind all prejudices and fears.\r\nBolívar visualized uniting the American half that\r\nwas discovered, populated and moulded in all its aspects\r\nby Spain and Portugal, seeing it as one that must\r\nnecessarily have its own way of life and of behaving. His\r\nvision was never based on rivalry, but rather, in keeping\r\nwith his views on the destiny of this shared hemisphere,\r\non the basis of emulation and friendship instead of strife\r\nas its driving force.\r\nThe colonizing Powers contributed, and based this\r\nhalf of America on, all they had brought with them. They\r\nestablished a religion, a society reminiscent of the\r\noffspring of settlers, whose physical surroundings and\r\nindiscriminate crossbreeding gave rise to a feeling of\r\nunfettered freedom and equality. This, in turn, engendered\r\nirrevocably an equally free spirit of social democracy,\r\nwhich Latin America has never since lacked, not even\r\nduring the long periods when political democracy was\r\nnon-existent.\r\nIn 1826, Bolívar, the Liberator, convened the\r\nCongress of Panama to speak there, for the first time in\r\nhistory, not of sacred or profane alliances of war, but of\r\nalliances for peace. The thoughts he presented gave rise\r\nto the idea of an organized international community, first\r\nof all for the Americas, through the Pan-American Union,\r\nwhich in turn gave rise to the present Organization of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nAmerican States (OAS), then to the League of Nations and\r\nfinally to this Organization, which has given humanity,\r\ntogether with peace, all the possibilities that peace offers.\r\nThis is an exceptional community, the largest in the\r\nworld, since it extends from the southern border of the\r\nUnited States all the way south to Patagonia, uniting the\r\ngreatest number of peoples and republics with similar\r\ncharacteristics. Here, the various languages spoken in Spain\r\nfortunately became one, revitalizing the Castilian tongue,\r\nand similarly, the Portuguese language, which in Brazil is\r\na language as open and soft as America itself. In the\r\nnorthernmost point of America, the imprint of France in\r\nCanada, as well as the Hispanic minority in the United\r\nStates, are living reminders of this community.\r\nIn geographical terms, we are larger than other official\r\ncommunities, since the United States’ surface area covers\r\n9,372,000 square kilometres and Europe’s covers\r\n10,404,000 square kilometres. But we cover 20,000,000\r\nsquare kilometres, and in these, the future of humanity is\r\npulsing.\r\nIn political and spiritual terms, we are history’s largest\r\nlaboratory, at once a mystery and a promise — an absolute\r\nwonder that the future is revealing day by day. The seed of\r\na new world, different from our expectations, is growing\r\namong us.\r\nWe are not the only five hundred million human\r\nbeings to be allergic to the discrimination that will confront\r\nus in the year 2000. But we are the only human group to\r\nhave been born and moulded without privileges, hesitations\r\nor complexes, on an equal footing. Though this sense of\r\nequality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic\r\nmeasures that were respected but not implemented, and by\r\nthe extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in\r\nimposing a single faith on this immense geographical area,\r\nit was imbued with the spaciousness of the land, the rivers,\r\nthe forests, the gentle climate, the mountains and prairies,\r\nwhose influence produced a different type of human\r\ncharacter. And I would repeat that this deep feeling and\r\nsense of fundamental freedom was something that had\r\nnever happened to any other group of people.\r\nGermán Arciniegas rightly said that\r\n“America was colonized by a man who was destined\r\nto a life of servitude in Europe. He became\r\nemancipated when he crossed from one shore to the\r\nother ... These wretches worked the continent with\r\ntheir bare hands, they were the poor, the landless, the\r\nilliterate of the popular Renaissance. Uneducated,\r\nunenlightened, their common destiny was to join\r\ntogether to become nations and so achieve justice.”\r\nAnd justice was the most absolute independence,\r\ninfluenced by American determinism.\r\nIn his sociologist’s discourse, Bolívar said that we\r\nAmericans represent a small human race. We have now\r\nbecome an important branch of the broader human race:\r\nthe branch of possibilities and hope.\r\nOur region would not enter into conflict with any\r\nother; not even with the one with which it shares the\r\nhemisphere, and which speaks a different language and\r\nhas different customs. It will not be another international\r\nagency, or form another bureaucracy, or take up more\r\nroom than the enormous space of its present physical and\r\nhuman geography.\r\nIn other words, we aspire to a beautiful Utopia, with\r\nno other pragmatism than the pride of being a Utopia\r\nwith ever more solidarity; part of the universe with shared\r\nvalues, in search of the same destiny.\r\nIf other continents fashion communities around\r\nreligious, racial or geopolitical banners, it is natural that\r\nwe, Latin Americans, put forth ours with our own\r\nimmense, protean sense of unity.\r\nThere was a time, as we followed a different cultural\r\npattern, when we had a more orderly society and enjoyed\r\npolitical systems that brought us fame throughout the\r\nworld. Practically all Latin American countries\r\nexperienced a sort of golden age of culture and politics,\r\nmarked by originality. We created literature. We forged\r\nour own laws with our own institutions. We pioneered the\r\nLaw of the Sea; we produced the first system against\r\nnuclear weapons, with the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\r\nA concerted Latin American community of nations\r\nwould tend to recuperate and exchange training and\r\neducational systems capable of affirming our collective\r\npride and personality, as Europe has already done, despite\r\nthe diversity of its components, out of fear of the return\r\nof thousands of years of violence. Morally, the Latin\r\nAmerican community would be equal to the commercial\r\nand economic commitments made through ALADI, the\r\nLatin American Integration Association, as well as the\r\nAndean Pact, the Central American Common Market and\r\nMERCOSUR, all designed to form a front of solidarity\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nand a crucial link in the economic integration of the\r\nuniverse.\r\nA conscious Latin American community of nations\r\nwould guarantee the sustainable development of the world’s\r\nmost varied and richest ecological systems, and would\r\nconceive not only of the larger spaces, but also of the\r\nimportance of drinking water, of mining resources, and of\r\nthe most varied and richest flora and fauna on the face of\r\nthe earth.\r\nOf course, we bring before the United Nations the\r\nmany concerns that we have expressed about the fate of our\r\nOrganization which, in its 50 years of arbitrating peace, has\r\ncharted a new path for the peoples it represents. These\r\nconcerns have prompted talk of reforming the Charter, in\r\norder for the Security Council, for instance, to take up and\r\nrepresent new geopolitical realities, and not only military\r\nmight. This is the spirit in which my country, through the\r\nvoice of its President, Rafael Caldera, has realistically and\r\nfrankly proposed that Brazil be the permanent\r\nrepresentative of Latin America in an enlarged Security\r\nCouncil. We have also spoken of the justification of\r\nagencies and powers, to make the cost of peace less\r\nburdensome; of the urgent need to adapt the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to the necessities of our time, as well as the\r\nCouncil for Culture, Science and Technology, that is still\r\nthe monopoly of industrialized centres. If a common market\r\nfor technology were to be established, we would be truly\r\nkeeping pace with history.\r\nIn America, although less than in Africa and Asia, we\r\ntoo are disturbed by the growing marginalization, the social\r\ninjustice, the poverty bordering on famine, the insecurity\r\nexacerbated by the trade in illicit drugs and its\r\nconsequences, which we witness. We produce terrible drugs\r\nin ever greater quantities to satisfy the voracity of the\r\nconsumer markets. But, at the same time, we fight this\r\nscourge with the greatest tenacity and determination.\r\nOur community has had the virtue of becoming\r\npractically a breeding ground for democracy, thanks to the\r\nsteadfastness of its leaders and thinkers, as well as of the\r\noldest but least championed regional organization. We must\r\nnow see to it that democracy is purged of its dishonesty,\r\nand is cleansed. To this end, at the Hemispheric Summit in\r\nMiami, my Government proposed, with unanimous support,\r\nto put a stop to the impunity of corruption.\r\nWe consider that drug trafficking and political\r\ncorruption are linked together by money laundering, under\r\nthe cover of electoral contributions.\r\nIf democracy is to acquire a new respectability, it\r\nwill be thanks to the common, concerted effort of\r\nAmerica; an effort which this world Organization will\r\nalso be called upon to make in the near future. That is\r\nbecause political corruption, a manifestation of the\r\nuniversal mafia, is not exclusive to our region and must\r\nbe fought at the global level, just like illicit drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nVery shortly, a world congress against corruption\r\nwill be held in China, doubtless inspired by our example.\r\nWe hold out great expectations for that congress. Indeed,\r\nwe are keenly interested in anything that is sponsored and\r\nadvanced by this Organization.\r\nBut I wanted to put before the Assembly the\r\nsomewhat romantic idea of a Latin American Utopia, that\r\nit might inspire confidence in our neighbours in this\r\nhemisphere and hope in all other regions, whether on an\r\norganized basis or not. This is the spirit in which the Rio\r\nGroup has endorsed the oft-repeated proposal for a Latin\r\nAmerican Parliament.\r\nSince the first Great War there has been a\r\ndislocation in Europe, which conveyed itself through\r\nSpain and Portugal; its aesthetic sense of life and\r\nexistence through Italy; its modes of thought and\r\nphilosophy through France; its political models through\r\nGreat Britain and its lasting technologies through\r\nGermany. A regrettable dislocation occurred between\r\nEurope and Latin America, which is truly its most\r\nkindred continent, where we live as distant cousins, and\r\nstill the most vibrant and promising offshoot of this\r\nlineage.\r\nIf we underscore the need to encourage this idea of\r\nour community, it is because it exists, in fact, although it\r\nis now beset with social problems that require combined\r\ntreatment. It also has a legalist existence, since States\r\nsuch as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and\r\nVenezuela have incorporated it into their political\r\nconstitutions.\r\nThe greatest tragedy of Latin America is its social\r\ncondition, because of the imbalances characteristic of any\r\nlarge society — irregularities in family patterns,\r\ndeficiencies in education, the destruction of homes due to\r\na lack of ethics — even housing, which was never one of\r\nour biggest problems, has become one, because it is\r\nlinked to a sense of ethics at the family level. They are\r\ninseparably linked.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nWe could say, along with Arturo Uslar Pietri that,\r\ncaught as we are between the millstones that grind the\r\npolitical universe, we have given more thought to building\r\nrepublics than to perfecting the nation that we are.\r\nIn spite of all its faults, the United Nations — the\r\nOrganization we aspired to and wish to maintain — has\r\ncreated a civilization. It is responsible for over 300\r\ninternational treaties: for the consolidation of democracy;\r\nfor the dedicated protection of refugees; for self-\r\ndetermination, freedom, independence, the dignity of life,\r\nthe arts, traditions; for coexistence — even if the phantoms\r\nof intolerance reappear; for trade free of protectionism; for\r\nchildren, women and our indigenous populations. And this,\r\nbeyond civilization, we can call the new culture of the\r\nhuman family.\r\nThe Organization has grown and expanded since 1945,\r\nand the world with it. Its many offspring, scattered among\r\nthe five continents and virtually all of them free, have led\r\nto a membership quadruple the number of the founding\r\nMembers, among them Venezuela, which was represented\r\nthen by its great Minister Caracciolo Parra Pérez. At that\r\ntime he voiced an idea that has even greater validity today:\r\n“The peoples of the world must know each other\r\nmorally and spiritually before they can manage to\r\ndispel the distrust and ignorance which keep them\r\napart. We must build up a kind of intellectual\r\nnetwork, above the network of the physical\r\ncommunications system which exists between nations,\r\nor parallel to it.” (Official Records of the United\r\nNations Conference on International Organization, 7th\r\nplenary meeting, p. 23)\r\nThis Organization’s greatest achievement has been to\r\noffer the world a span of half a century during which,\r\ndespite remaining fears, it could think of a new course for\r\nharmonizing all aspects of the life of societies with the\r\nnature that shelters those societies.\r\nI congratulate the Organization and the President of\r\nthe General Assembly, Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral, in the\r\nhope that under his leadership the Organization will achieve\r\nall the success it deserves and needs. All races, all\r\nreligions, all the most varied shades of humankind bring\r\ntheir aspirations and their claims here. This is an spacious\r\nhome that has always endeavoured to live in the peace that\r\nis and must be the normal condition of life. It has been said\r\nthat if health is the peace of the body, peace is the health\r\nof peoples. In that connection, the pre-Socratic philosopher\r\nwrote that in times of peace people awake to the crowing\r\nof roosters, while in times of war they waken to the\r\nclamour of arms; in peace the young bury the old, while\r\nin war the old bury the young.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call next on the First Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait, His Excellency\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.\r\nSheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Kuwait, to convey to Mr. Diego Freitas do\r\nAmaral our sincere congratulations on his unanimous\r\nelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We have no doubt that his election is\r\ntestimony to his expertise and skills, which will guarantee\r\nthe able stewardship of this historic session. I assure\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of the support and cooperation of\r\nthe delegation of the State of Kuwait.\r\nI take this opportunity to commend the President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, for his significant contribution to the\r\nwork of this world body as well as for the wisdom he\r\ndemonstrated as he presided over the deliberations of the\r\nlast session.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his immense\r\nefforts to streamline the structure and operations of the\r\nUnited Nations with an eye to the constantly changing\r\nmodern world. Also, I should like to put on record\r\nKuwait’s support for the proposals put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General in his programme of action to deal with\r\npotential crises, the use of preventive diplomacy and the\r\nmodalities of peacemaking and peace-building. In this\r\ncontext, special mention should be made of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s annual report on the work of the Organization,\r\nwhich demonstrates incisive vision combined with a\r\ndispassionate and in-depth analysis of the challenges\r\nfacing the United Nations. The report outlines in a\r\nresponsible fashion the failures suffered in some of the\r\nactivities and operations undertaken by the Organization.\r\nNext month, a great number of Heads of States or\r\nGovernments will come to New York City to celebrate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United\r\nNations. This massive presence will reflect a genuine\r\nbelief in the role of the United Nations in building a\r\nworld founded on justice, equality, coexistence and\r\ncooperation, free of tension and aggression. Their\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nstatements in this Assembly Hall will no doubt define their\r\nvision of the tasks the United Nations should undertake,\r\ntheir hopes for the ideal way of life that should prevail in\r\nthe world and their determination to spare no effort in\r\nworking for a better world. We cherish the wisdom of the\r\nfounding fathers who established an Organization that\r\nembodies mankind’s collective effort and hope in a better\r\nworld that would differ from the world of war and strife,\r\nwhich wrought enormous destruction in terms of\r\ngeopolitical entities, property and human life. States were\r\ndestroyed and entire human populations were annihilated to\r\nsatisfy the capricious whims of individuals who were driven\r\nby greed and hegemony. The scale of sacrifice and\r\ndevastation, and the toll in human life caused by the\r\ndevelopment of atomic weapons was too immense to\r\nignore. In the wake of such destruction, the world’s leaders\r\nwere determined to make the Second World War the last\r\nwar the world should ever endure.\r\nThe signing ceremony of the United Nations Charter\r\nin San Francisco was, in a sense, a universal pledge to\r\nrenounce the use of force, to embrace peaceful coexistence\r\nand to shun the power politics of blackmail and hegemony.\r\nRegardless, the world continued to live thereafter in an\r\nenvironment that differed from the vision of the founding\r\nfathers of the United Nations. The intense bipolar strife that\r\nfollowed plunged the world in the maelstrom of a cold war\r\nthat lasted for some five decades and spawned numerous\r\nregional conflicts with which the United Nations dealt\r\nwithin the constraints imposed by big Power rivalries. The\r\ninability to act was not due to impotence on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations but was the direct result of that bipolar\r\nrivalry. Notwithstanding, the Organization did manage to\r\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in many a peace-keeping\r\noperation it undertook over the past decades and did\r\nmanage to pacify many a volatile area.\r\nIn point of fact, experience has shown, over the past\r\nfew decades, that the presence of the United Nations in the\r\nareas of tension did prevent the eruption of conflict and war\r\nin several flash points while its absence increased the\r\nchances of war. In all this, the United Nations has been a\r\ntrue reflection of the will of its Member States and, during\r\nthe cold war, it provided a war-prevention mechanism by\r\ncreating buffer zones between the belligerents. It was\r\neffective in containing tensions and in creating a climate of\r\npeaceful negotiation.\r\nOver the years, the United Nations system has\r\ndeveloped an array of effective and credible mechanisms,\r\nand gained wide-ranging experience and undoubted\r\ncredibility that are employed to the common benefit of\r\nmankind. Over the past 50 years, since the adoption of its\r\nCharter, the United Nations has worked consistently to\r\ngive real meaning to the dream of peoples all over the\r\nworld, that of saving\r\n“succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\r\nwhich ... has brought untold sorrow to mankind” —\r\nas expressed in the opening paragraph of the Charter. In\r\nlarge measure, the United Nations has lived up to its\r\ninitial commitment.\r\nOnce the cold-war chapter was closed, the world\r\nstarted to edge towards rapprochement and meaningful\r\ndialogue. Once the arms race ended, an intense\r\ndevelopment-race started. The territorial-gains mentality\r\ngave way to a new commitment to intensive human\r\ndevelopment. Thus the new challenge facing our world\r\nnow is the fulfilment of the immediate concerns of the\r\nhuman person and his or her right to live in dignity.\r\nThe world was an arena of rivalry between the\r\nsuper-Powers; now it has become a vast battlefield in the\r\nwar against poverty and backwardness. The world was a\r\nbattleground for fighting between various blocs in\r\ndifferent regions; now many regions are closing ranks in\r\na common effort to combat illiteracy and want. While the\r\nworld was the theatre of many a battle, now the world\r\nhas but one battle, that of trying to break loose from the\r\ngrip of underdevelopment and backwardness.\r\nWe in Kuwait were in the forefront of donors for\r\ndevelopment. The volume of assistance we offered was\r\nthe highest, in terms of gross national product, because\r\nwe wanted to live in a world dominated by justice, a\r\nworld whose hallmark is human compassion, a world in\r\nwhich the privileged will reach out towards the\r\nunderprivileged without strings attached.\r\nAlong these lines, Kuwait welcomes the trend\r\ntowards the consolidation of relations between members\r\nof the family of nations on the basis of equality. We are\r\npart of a common effort to eliminate tensions. We rely on\r\nthe collective will of nations to suppress aggression, and\r\non global cooperation to confront underdevelopment.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we cannot overlook the need\r\nfor reform and restructuring inside the United Nations\r\nitself with a view to bringing the system more into line\r\nwith these new objectives. In 1945, 50 founding Member\r\nStates signed the Charter. Ever since, 135 other States\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nhave joined the membership. Regardless, the Security\r\nCouncil, which is a major organ of the system, has, for\r\nexample, retained its original structure — without change\r\nto reflect the enormous expansion in the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. Nor has the Economic and Social Council\r\nshown, as yet, significant improvement in programme\r\ndelivery, as dictated by the requirements of modern\r\ndevelopment, in the broad sense of such requirements, at\r\nthe threshold of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe call for expanding the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil in order to enable the larger membership of the\r\nUnited Nations to participate in the process of decision-\r\nmaking. The change, which would enhance fairness, should\r\nbe effected in such a way as to ensure balance between the\r\nrequirements of efficiency and of expansion. We also call\r\nfor more transparency in the Council’s methods of work,\r\nfor this, in our view, would reinforce our sense of\r\ncollective participation and responsibility. We are also in\r\nfavour of the trend towards better use of the resources of\r\nthose States that can contribute significantly to\r\npeace-keeping operations and development activities.\r\nThe people of Kuwait participate in the celebrations of\r\nthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary with a deep sense of\r\ngratitude to the Organization for its crucial role in liberating\r\nKuwait from occupation. The people of Kuwait recognize\r\nthe firm resolve of the world community in rejecting\r\naggression and its commitment to putting an end to\r\noccupation. We cherish the determination displayed in the\r\nseries of successive resolutions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil from the second day of August 1990, when the\r\npeople of Kuwait, together with the rest of the world, were\r\ntaken by surprise by the sneak invasion of the State of\r\nKuwait by Iraq. That naked aggression was committed in\r\ntotal violation of the principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations and international treaties. Beyond Kuwait, the\r\ninvasion totally shattered the security and stability of the\r\nentire Gulf region.\r\nIn facing up to that blatant aggression, the United\r\nNations did indeed live up to its principles and was true to\r\nits mission. It did indeed stand firm in upholding justice\r\nand in defending the victim.\r\nBuilding on the Kuwait experience, it is our hope that\r\nthe critical role that the United Nations can play will be\r\nfully utilized to further consolidate the underpinning of\r\npeace and to safeguard security and stability. The United\r\nNations system can indeed provide deterrence in the face of\r\nthose regimes that harbour schemes of aggression. There is\r\na full range of measures and restrictions that the United\r\nNations can put in place to ensure the isolation and\r\ncurtailment of those aggressive regimes and, if need be,\r\nto strip them of their stockpiles of weapons that can be\r\nused in committing aggression.\r\nThe ultimate goal of the United Nations is to ensure\r\nequality, mutual respect amongst Member States and\r\nrespect for the will of peoples. This would be conducive\r\nto peaceful coexistence among nations and would create\r\na favourable atmosphere allowing freedom of choice in a\r\ndemocratic climate, where the stronger cannot dominate\r\nthe weaker, nor can a big country exploit a small\r\nneighbour, nor one party assume a privileged role to the\r\ndetriment of others.\r\nOver a long period — since the end of the Gulf\r\nwar — the Iraqi regime has continued to claim that it has\r\nfulfilled all its obligations under all Security Council\r\nresolutions relating to the situation between Iraq and\r\nKuwait, especially resolutions 687 (1991) and 715 (1991),\r\nand thus blamed the Security Council and the Special\r\nCommission for the delay in lifting the sanctions imposed\r\non Iraq. The Chairman and staff of the Special\r\nCommission, as well as the Security Council itself, have\r\nbeen harshly and offensively criticized by senior Iraqi\r\nofficials and the regime-controlled media.\r\nIn view of the recent dramatic surprises that\r\nunfolded in regard to the Iraqi armament programmes, a\r\nthoroughly legitimate set of questions arises — namely:\r\nDoes the Iraqi regime have any more credibility? Who\r\namongst us would be willing to accept Iraq’s statements\r\nat face value? Who would believe its claims, echoed at\r\nevery gathering or forum, that it had met its obligations?\r\nWhat about Kuwaiti property and military hardware\r\nlooted from Kuwait? Who can go along with Iraq’s\r\nassertions regarding Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners\r\nand hostages?\r\nThe tragedy of Kuwaiti and other prisoners held by\r\nIraq remains unresolved four years after the liberation of\r\nKuwait. This is due to the intransigence and\r\nprocrastination of the Iraqi regime, which continues to\r\nsidestep a straightforward and genuine resolution of this\r\nhuman tragedy. This represents a failure on the part of\r\nIraq to fulfil its commitments under paragraph 30 of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991), which demands\r\nthat Iraq should cooperate fully with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross.\r\nAccordingly, Kuwait reiterates its appeal, to the\r\nSecurity Council in particular and to the world\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\ncommunity in general, to continue to bring pressure to bear\r\non Iraq, in a bid to bring this painful episode to an end.\r\nIraq’s false claims and lies that it is sincere in its efforts to\r\nclose this case should be met with a firm stand. Indeed, this\r\nwas the only course of action that forced Iraq in the first\r\nplace to cooperate with the Special Commission.\r\nIraq must recognize that participation in the meetings\r\nof the Tripartite Commission and its sub-committee is not\r\nan end in itself. The purpose of these meetings is to secure\r\nthe freedom of prisoners and to account for the missing\r\npersons. The litmus test of Iraq’s cooperation in this area is\r\nthe number of persons released or accounted for. Mere\r\nattendance at those meetings is an exercise in subterfuge,\r\nintended by Iraq to mislead world public opinion and to\r\ncircumvent its obligations.\r\nThe final objective of Kuwait’s overall policy is to\r\nensure security and stability in our region. This goal will\r\nremain elusive unless and until Iraq implements fully and\r\nunconditionally all relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe are aware of the difficulties endured by the Iraqi\r\npeople. However, the responsibility for the suffering of the\r\nIraqis lies squarely on the regime itself which wasted\r\nvaluable time since April 1991 in pursuing a futile course\r\nof prevarication, deception, suppression of data and\r\nmisinformation in regard to every area of its mandatory\r\nobligations.\r\nThe most recent events came to confirm our\r\nsuspicions and fears, namely, the disclosure of the\r\npossession by Iraq of an arsenal of prohibited weapons of\r\nmass destruction, which were being prepared for use against\r\npeoples of the region without heed for the potential massive\r\nloss of human life.\r\nIn the meantime, let me take this occasion to set on\r\nrecord that Kuwait affirms the need to maintain the unity\r\nand territorial integrity of Iraq. In view of the hardships\r\nfaced by the Iraqi people, Kuwait has moved to send,\r\nthrough the Kuwait Red Crescent Society, food and medical\r\nsupplies to the Iraqi civilian population in areas bordering\r\nIran and in Northern Iraq. We will continue to pursue this\r\npolicy on humanitarian grounds.\r\nIn the context of international endeavours to bring\r\nabout just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle\r\nEast, Kuwait follows closely the ongoing peace negotiations\r\nbetween the immediate parties. We support the negotiations\r\nprocess. In our view, this process should be anchored in the\r\nset of principles agreed upon, namely, full withdrawal in\r\nreturn for peace. Also, progress should be made on all\r\ntracks of negotiations. And the final peace package should\r\nbe satisfactory to all sides because this would be the real\r\nguarantee of a lasting peace.\r\nKuwait did participate in the multilateral negotiations\r\nbecause we believed that our role within the multilaterals\r\nwould strengthen the position of the Arab parties engaged\r\nin the bilateral talks and would eventually give\r\nmomentum to the process as a whole. We fully appreciate\r\nthe position of our sister State, Syria, which insists on full\r\nIsraeli withdrawal from occupied Syrian territory in return\r\nfor peace. Israel cannot attain full peace without complete\r\nwithdrawal.\r\nIn the same vein, international efforts should\r\nintensify to ensure full implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978) which requires\r\nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese\r\nterritory and the exercise by the Lebanese Government of\r\nits sovereignty over all Lebanese territory, including the\r\nSouth. In the end, the territorial integrity and\r\nindependence of Lebanon must be preserved.\r\nFurthermore, Kuwait supports the self-rule\r\nnegotiations between the Palestine National Authority and\r\nIsrael. In our view, the agreement signed yesterday in\r\nWashington, D.C. regarding the expansion of the self-rule\r\narrangements represents an important step in the right\r\ndirection towards the exercise by the people of Palestine\r\nof their right to self-determination and the establishment\r\nof their independent State.\r\nIn this regard, let me recall that Kuwait has pledged\r\n$25 million in aid to the development programmes\r\nundertaken by international specialized agencies in the\r\nself-rule areas. Indeed, Kuwait has started disbursement\r\nof funds earmarked for those purposes.\r\nAlso, we would like to underline the status of\r\noccupied Al-Quds, given its special significance to the\r\nthree heavenly-revealed religions. We emphasize that Al-\r\nQuds is Palestinian territory under occupation and should\r\nas such be subject to the withdrawal conditions under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967).\r\nKuwait welcomes the recent developments aiming at\r\nachieving a fair settlement of the situation in the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. We expect such a settlement\r\nshould satisfy the behests of international legality and be\r\nbased on Security Council resolutions. In the wake of\r\nlarge-scale suffering, destruction and displacement, the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\npeople of the region now yearn for an overall settlement\r\nthat satisfies the demands of all parties, especially the\r\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina who insist on\r\nmaintaining their independent State on their own territory\r\nwithout any interference from outside. My Government\r\nvalues the role played by the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and the United Nations Protection\r\nForces (UNPROFOR) in opposing territorial expansion by\r\nthe Serbs at the expense of other parties, as well as the\r\nactions taken to lift the siege on Sarajevo. It is our hope\r\nthat this joint NATO-UNPROFOR action will persist until\r\nthe declared objective is attained, that is, the conclusion of\r\na final accord that brings security and stability to the whole\r\nregion. It is our sincere hope now that the most recent\r\nagreement reached several days ago will be honoured by\r\nthe parties to the conflict.\r\nExperience has shown that regional groupings and\r\narrangements can play an effective role in addressing\r\ncontentious issues that create tension, impact adversely on\r\npeace and security and poison the relations amongst the\r\npeople of a given area. These groups have also\r\ndemonstrated a great sense of commitment in defusing flash\r\npoints of tension that might undermine regional security.\r\nA case in point is the experience of the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council whose member States are firmly\r\nconvinced that understanding among them is crucial in\r\nsteering away from frictions and tensions. To them,\r\ndialogue is an essential channel of confidence-building\r\namong neighbour States. Since our established policy\r\nconsiders negotiations as the only viable means of resolving\r\ndisputes, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to\r\nrespond favourably to the call by the United Arab Emirates\r\nto resolve the problem of the islands occupied by Iran by\r\nthe means suggested by the International Court of Justice.\r\nSuch an approach would indeed reinforce the principle of\r\nunderstanding and negotiations to which we adhere as a\r\nprimary component in relations among States.\r\nKuwait is convinced that world peace is indivisible\r\nand that it has far-reaching multiple implications on all of\r\nus. Accordingly, ethnic disputes, tribal wars and factional\r\nconflicts should be addressed as phenomena that can lead\r\nto massacres and genocides and to a total collapse of the\r\nafflicted communities. Therefore, in this year which marks\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we ring down\r\nthe curtain on the Rwanda tragedy before a solution is\r\nfound, nor can we walk away from the catastrophe in\r\nSomalia, nor give up hope in the face of enormous odds in\r\nAfghanistan. All these remain burning issues despite the\r\nfeeling by some Powers that they have moved outside the\r\ncircle of global strategic limelight.\r\nWe call for scaling up the efforts and showing more\r\ndetermination in addressing these festering wounds within\r\nthe framework of collective world peace.\r\nThe burden of debt is a major constraint on the\r\nbudget resources of many nations, especially the\r\ndeveloping ones. It aggravates their social problems and\r\npushes up unemployment rates to a point where it\r\nundermines domestic security and stability and endangers\r\nthe lives of millions of people.\r\nBack in 1988, His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad\r\nAl-Jaber, Emir of the State of Kuwait, launched from this\r\nrostrum an initiative to write off the foreign debt under\r\nwhich many least developed countries were suffering.\r\nThose countries have been victims of a complex host of\r\nfactors that denied them the privilege of a calm life and\r\nindeed posed a real threat to their very existence. Kuwait,\r\nfor its part, cancelled all interest on loans to these\r\ncountries in a bid to alleviate their debt burdens. It is our\r\nhope that this approach would be expanded and that the\r\ndeveloped nations would cancel the interest on their loans\r\nto the developing countries.\r\nThe dreams of the Charter’s authors stood the test of\r\ntime and transcended the tensions and limitations of the\r\ncold war. The era of the cold war was characterized by\r\nthe stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction to the\r\ndetriment of construction needs. It represented a hard\r\ndrive to acquire the means of annihilation at the expense\r\nof the means of development. Prestige was put ahead of\r\nreal meaningful growth. Human ingenuity was put in the\r\nservice of human exploitation rather than in the service of\r\nenhancing human freedoms. That chapter is now over.\r\nAnd we have entered a new epoch in which we have to\r\nheed the rational calls for civilized conduct in order to\r\nbuild up an atmosphere of genuine brotherhood and\r\nharmony. This can only be achieved by our collective\r\nendeavour that emphasizes our universal identity. Only\r\nthrough such a common effort can we pool together the\r\nresources and energy of all peoples, big and small, to\r\nachieve a strategic consensus that would translate into a\r\nreality the dreams envisioned 50 years ago when the\r\nCharter was signed.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Croatia, His Excellency Mr. Mate\r\nGranic.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nMr. Granic (Croatia): Let me first extend my heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his\r\nelection to the distinguished office from which he will\r\nguide the work of the fiftieth session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that his experience and\r\ncommitment to the noble principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter will guarantee that this session will be marked by\r\nnew vigour, commitment and determination. I wish to\r\nexpress our gratitude also to his predecessor, Mr. Amara\r\nEssy, for the fine, skilful manner in which he presided over\r\nthe work of the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe world we live in has been deeply and positively\r\naffected by the end of the cold war and national\r\nemancipation in Central and Eastern Europe, and Western\r\nAsia. Many hotbeds of crisis have been extinguished or are\r\non the way to being resolved, from Eastern Asia and South\r\nAfrica to the Middle East.\r\nMr. Obadi (Yemen), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nHowever, many problems having a negative impact on\r\ninternational relations remain unresolved, including the\r\ncrisis in south-eastern Europe. Most disquieting are the\r\ndangers of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nespecially nuclear weapons. The world is still faced with\r\nvarious forms of terrorism. There is a grave danger\r\nresulting from the illicit trade in narcotics. Widespread\r\nabuses of human rights continue as do the problems of\r\nracism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and national and\r\nreligious intolerance. The solution to the problem of\r\nunderdevelopment requires more concerted and coordinated\r\nefforts.\r\nIn order to be able to deal with the many problems\r\nfacing the world, it is necessary to have a vital and efficient\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFollowing the end of the cold war there was a period\r\nof optimism, renewed hope and expectation that the United\r\nNations would finally play the role which had been\r\nenvisaged for it at the time of its founding, almost 50 years\r\nago. However, we have recently experienced severe\r\ndisappointment at the inability of the United Nations to\r\nfulfil all these expectations; this has resulted in the loss of\r\ncredibility by the United Nations.\r\nThe causes for its loss of credibility are many and\r\nvaried, and among the most important is the failure of\r\nmany United Nations peace-keeping operations to achieve\r\ntheir assigned goals. This is not to say that there have not\r\nbeen successful United Nations peace-keeping missions; this\r\nis evident from the operations in Cambodia and southern\r\nAfrica.\r\nOne way in which the peace-keeping or\r\npeacemaking missions of the United Nations could be\r\nimproved is by the establishment of a United Nations\r\nmilitary force of a more permanent nature or one that\r\ncould be assembled quickly, consisting of contingents\r\nfrom specific countries or regional arrangements. Such a\r\nforce should be constructed in such a way as to make\r\nsure that its national contingents acted to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and not to promote the\r\npolicies of their States. In this regard I wish to express\r\nthe Republic of Croatia’s interest in providing troops for\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\nHowever, in order to make the peace-keeping\r\nfunctions of the United Nations more effective it is\r\nnecessary to reform the body which is primarily\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity — the Security Council. It is also important that\r\nthe composition of the Security Council reflect the new\r\npolitical and economic realities which have emerged since\r\nits formation after the Second World War. Due regard\r\nmust also be given to proper geographical balance as well\r\nas to the increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations. Making the Security Council more representative\r\nand democratic will also enhance its credibility as it will\r\nthen be a more legitimate body representing the will of\r\nthe international community. This will no doubt serve to\r\nfacilitate the implementation of its resolutions.\r\nIn this regard, the Republic of Croatia supports an\r\nincrease in the number of both the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council to a\r\npoint which will not negatively affect its effectiveness. I\r\nwish to reiterate Croatia’s support for the admission of\r\nGermany and Japan as permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council due to the actual, as well as potential,\r\ncontribution of these two countries to the cause of\r\ninternational peace and security and to other aspects of\r\nthe work of the United Nations. Additionally, serious\r\nconsideration should be given to the possibility of one or\r\nmore developing countries from Asia, Africa or Latin\r\nAmerica being granted permanent-member status.\r\nDespite the various setbacks which I have already\r\nreferred to, the United Nations still has a critical role to\r\nplay in resolving many of the world’s problems,\r\nespecially in regard to the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nIn addition to economic well-being, equal attention\r\nshould be paid to respect for the human rights of each and\r\nevery individual. In this regard, Croatia reiterates its\r\nsupport for the work of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, Mr. José Ayalo Lasso, and commends the manner\r\nin which he has been performing his duty. As a further\r\nmethod of combating gross violations of human rights and\r\ninternational humanitarian law, Croatia supports the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court in the form\r\nof an apolitical legal organ of the international community.\r\nBy its geographical position, history, socio-cultural\r\nfeatures, and political and economic orientation, the\r\nRepublic of Croatia is a part of both Central Europe and\r\nthe Mediterranean. As a European country in transition,\r\nCroatia has already achieved significant progress in the\r\ndevelopment of democratic institutions and adherence to\r\ninternationally accepted standards concerning the rule of\r\nlaw and protection of human rights. It is also worth noting\r\nthat the economic situation has been stabilized and even\r\nimproved during the past two years, despite the extremely\r\ndifficult conditions caused by Serbian aggression. Our\r\nnational development strategy is outward-oriented, while the\r\nsocial policies and legal framework are based on the\r\nprinciples of pluralistic democracy, including an\r\nopen-market economy.\r\nAs a country of European civilization and tradition,\r\nCroatia’s strategic, political, economic and social orientation\r\nis clearly focused on active participation in the process of\r\nEuropean integration. Croatia’s harmonization with\r\nEuropean legislation and criteria represents a crucial part of\r\nits national development. While Croatia is already a\r\nmember of various European intergovernmental and\r\ninterregional organizations, the forging of closer relations\r\nwith the European Union, as well as full membership in the\r\nCouncil of Europe, are the basic pillars of Croatia’s\r\nEuropean policy. However, Croatia will seek to adopt an\r\napproach to reflecting a balance between its European\r\norientation and its wider global cooperation on a\r\nmultilateral and bilateral basis.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia endeavours to contribute to\r\nlasting peace and durable stability in south-eastern Europe,\r\nwhich can be achieved only by the normalization of\r\nrelations among all States based on full and strict respect\r\nfor and adherence to the principles of the inviolability of\r\ninternational borders, the territorial integrity of all States\r\nand the rights of minorities.\r\nCroatia has effectively assumed its role as an\r\nindispensable factor in the search for peace, stability and\r\nsecurity. In this sense, Croatia will continue to cooperate\r\nconstructively with the relevant international forums and\r\nleading institutions or countries with a view to finding a\r\npolitical solution to the present crisis in the region.\r\nIn this respect — and bearing in mind the nature of\r\nthe crisis and that its underlying cause has been and\r\nremains Serbian aggression — Croatia will continue to\r\ncooperate closely and coordinate its political, military and\r\ndiplomatic activities with the Republic and Federation of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, on the basis of the Washington\r\nAgreements and other bilateral agreements and\r\narrangements such as the Split Declaration. This is\r\nbecause one of the prerequisites for ensuring long-term\r\nstability and progress for Croatia is the settlement of the\r\ncrisis in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThanks to the clarity and transparency of its national\r\nagenda, the decisiveness of its political leadership and its\r\ncooperation with the international community in pursuit\r\nof its vital national interests, Croatia has succeeded over\r\nthe course of several years in reintegrating most of its\r\noccupied territories, paving the way for the return of\r\nsome 110,000 displaced persons and refugees to their\r\nhomes, as well as in revitalizing energy and transport\r\ncommunications throughout the country.\r\nCroatia has also managed in very difficult\r\ncircumstances to reach reasonable stability and to enjoy\r\nincreased prospects for further development and the\r\nstrengthening of the democratic system and institutions,\r\ncombined with a significant level of economic\r\nstabilization.\r\nSince the outbreak of the crisis in south-eastern\r\nEurope Croatia has constantly advocated a negotiated\r\npeaceful solution, with the active support and full\r\nparticipation of the international community, and on the\r\nbasis of the principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law.\r\nSpecial emphasis has been placed on the imperative\r\nof fully regulating and normalizing Croat-Serb relations.\r\nFuture relations between these two States are of\r\nparamount importance for lasting stability in south-eastern\r\nEurope. At the same time, Croatia is actively contributing\r\nto the quest for a solution to the issue of the\r\nBosniac-Muslim people, one that would ensure their\r\nnational rights and provide stability for the region.\r\nFurthermore, in the interests of ensuring long-term\r\nsecurity and stability, Croatia has advocated the need for\r\nthe introduction of the confidence- and security- building\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nmeasures of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE).\r\nCroatia has always done its utmost to enable the\r\ninternational community to pursue its peace efforts and has\r\nconsistently demonstrated utmost restraint in resorting to the\r\nuse of force. When we had to use force, our military\r\nalways strove to minimize the loss of life and the extent of\r\ndestruction and to enable the international community to\r\npursue its peace efforts. Croatian military operations have\r\nalways been in self-defence and in response to the\r\nintransigence and non-cooperation of the rebel Croatian-\r\nSerb leadership, to the inability of the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping forces to fulfil their mandate, to complete\r\ndeadlock in international mediating efforts, or to direct\r\nprovocations and terrorist attacks against civilians from the\r\nrebel Serb side.\r\nIn the aftermath of the liberation of almost one fifth of\r\nour country in August, isolated instances of unlawful\r\nbehaviour and human rights abuses have been recorded. My\r\nGovernment strongly condemns all such individual acts and\r\nhas initiated proceedings against the perpetrators.\r\nCroatia believes that its military operations during the\r\nfirst week of August, on both sides of the Croatian-Bosnian\r\nborder, have substantially changed the balance of power\r\nand in so doing have created a window of opportunity for\r\nrevitalization of the ongoing peace process. Croatia is of the\r\nopinion that the joint effects of Operation Storm, the\r\ncoordinated activities of the army of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and HVO (Croatian Defence Council) units,\r\nand the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) rapid reaction force against the Bosnian Serbs,\r\ncoupled with diplomatic efforts, have finally opened the\r\nway to serious and comprehensive peace negotiations,\r\nwhich will eventually lead to a realistic, balanced and\r\nlasting solution to the crisis.\r\nCroatia fully supports the current United States peace\r\ninitiative and the increased decisiveness of the international\r\ncommunity, manifested particularly by the United Nations\r\nand NATO rapid-reaction force operations and pressure\r\nagainst the Bosnian Serbs.\r\nCroatia’s major interest with regard to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is in achieving a lasting peace and just\r\nsettlement of the conflict that would be satisfactory to the\r\nconstituent peoples and that would ensure stability along\r\nCroatian borders; the survival, safety and dignified life of\r\nthe Bosnian Croats; and mutually beneficial relations and\r\ncooperation between the two friendly neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nTherefore, Croatia strongly supports the\r\nimplementation of the Washington Agreements and the\r\nSplit Declaration and the strengthening of the Federation\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and its association with\r\nCroatia at various levels and in various areas of\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe prerequisites for lasting stability, security and\r\ncooperation in the region include a just and lasting\r\nsolution to the crisis, reconstruction and development of\r\nthe countries in the region, normalization of relations\r\nbetween all successor States of the former Yugoslavia on\r\nthe basis of equal succession and introduction of a new\r\nregional order as an integral part of the new European\r\nsecurity system.\r\nIt is Croatia’s firm position that the solution for the\r\npeaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied\r\nterritories of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\r\nSrijem and the former United Nations Confidence\r\nRestoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) Sector East\r\nmust be an integral part of the overall peaceful resolution\r\nof the crisis in the region, in both Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and Croatia, within the time-frame of the\r\ncurrent peace initiative and the expiration date of the\r\nUNCRO mandate. Without progress in the solution of this\r\nissue, progress in the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina cannot be envisaged, and neither can\r\nany real stabilization of the situation in south-eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nDeeply committed to peaceful reintegration, Croatia\r\nis willing to immediately open meaningful and\r\nconstructive talks with the representatives of the Serb\r\npopulation in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\r\nSrijem that should lead to the re-establishment of\r\nCroatia’s full sovereignty, the return of forcibly displaced\r\npersons to their homes and respect, in accordance with\r\nhigh European standards, for the minority rights of the\r\nSerbs and other minority ethnic or national\r\ncommunities — Slovak, Hungarian, Ukrainian and\r\nothers — in this area.\r\nTo this end Croatia has already proposed to the local\r\nSerbs and the Government of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, through the good offices of the international\r\nmediators, a comprehensive, elaborate and concrete peace\r\nplan in the form of a draft agreement on the peaceful\r\nreintegration of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nSrijem into the constitutional and economic system of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia.\r\nImplementation of the proposed agreement must begin\r\nwith the immediate withdrawal of all military and\r\nparamilitary groups not originally from this region, to be\r\nfollowed by the disarming and disbanding, under UNCRO\r\nsupervision, of the military and paramilitary groups\r\ncomposed of persons who reside in the area.\r\nUpon signing the agreement on the peaceful\r\nreintegration of the remaining occupied areas, the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia would\r\nrecognize each other within their internationally recognized\r\nborders and diplomatic relations between these two States\r\nwould be established at the ambassadorial level. This would\r\nbe followed shortly by the reopening of the Zagreb-\r\nBelgrade highway and railways, the river traffic along the\r\nDanube and Sava rivers, the Adriatic pipeline’s outlet to\r\nSerbia and telecommunications between Croatia and the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nThe proposed draft agreement provides ample evidence\r\nof Croatia’s sincere will and disposition to find a negotiated\r\nand just solution to the reintegration of the remaining\r\noccupied territories, providing for the legitimate rights of\r\nCroatia as a sovereign State and of all its citizens, including\r\nits minorities. Along these lines, Croatia participated in the\r\nContact Group negotiations in Geneva and New York.\r\nFollowing these negotiations, I am moderately optimistic\r\nthat the resolution of the crisis and peace in the region can\r\nbe achieved in the near future.\r\nHowever, there is no doubt that progress towards a\r\nlasting, just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the\r\ncontinued, determined and coordinated efforts of the\r\ninternational community in the maintenance of a global\r\napproach to the current peace initiative and the continuation\r\nof the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime.\r\nIn the next several weeks the parties and the international\r\ncommunity have to work out a framework, in the form of\r\na package, for the peace accord, which should include\r\nseveral interrelated steps: a solution for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina; a resolution of the issue of Eastern Slavonia\r\nleading to its reintegration into Croatia; mutual recognition,\r\nwithin their international borders, between Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia; and changes in the sanctions regime against the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia as the international\r\ncommunity deems appropriate. Upon the acceptance of such\r\na plan, the road to lasting peace and stability will be\r\nopened.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to thank\r\nagain all the countries contributing troops to the UNCRO\r\noperations in Croatia and underscore our appreciation of\r\ntheir efforts to aid the peace process. Croatia deeply\r\nregrets the loss of life and the injuries sustained by\r\nmembers of the United Nations force during their mission\r\nin Croatia. Their noble sacrifice will always be\r\nremembered and cherished by the Croatian people.\r\nIn the name of my Government, I am particularly\r\nproud to thank the General Assembly for having\r\nsupported the cause of Croatia, most of all by adopting\r\nresolution 49/43, concerning the occupied territories of\r\nCroatia. I kindly ask the Assembly to remain steadfast in\r\nthe contribution it has made through this important\r\nresolution and through the individual and collective\r\nengagement of most Members’ Governments to the search\r\nfor a just and lasting peace for Croatia and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, as well as for the whole of south-eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, His Excellency\r\nMr. Karolos Papoulias, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Papoulias (Greece) (spoke in Greek; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Allow me at the outset\r\nto extend to the President of the General Assembly the\r\nwarmest congratulations of the Greek Government on his\r\nelection to the presidency at this historic fiftieth session,\r\nwhich is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities\r\nand his distinguished international career. I would also\r\nlike to thank His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy for the\r\nhighly constructive and efficient manner in which he\r\nperformed his duties as President of the General\r\nAssembly during its forty-ninth session.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to address my sincere\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is striving with\r\ncourage, energy, political will and vision for a new world\r\nin which law and ethics will prevail, and for the\r\nrestructuring of the Organization, so that it may meet the\r\nchallenges of our time. He has our full support in his\r\nefforts to fulfil his mission.\r\nLet me also welcome Palau, the new Member that\r\nhas been admitted to the United Nations this year. Its\r\npresence among us is a renewed expression of our\r\nOrganization’s desire to welcome in its midst all those\r\nStates that undertake the commitment to adhere to the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\npurposes and principles set out in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThe Foreign Minister of Spain, in his capacity as\r\nPresident of the Council of the European Union, delivered\r\na statement earlier this week on behalf of the Union and its\r\nmember States. My Government fully subscribes to the\r\ncontent of that statement and of the memorandum of the\r\nUnion. I would like, however, to elaborate further on some\r\nissues which are of particular interest to my country.\r\nThis fiftieth session of the General Assembly provides\r\nus with an opportunity, not only for an annual exchange of\r\nviews between the States Members of the United Nations\r\non the state of international affairs, but also for the\r\ncelebration of a milestone in the life of the Organization.\r\nThis celebration should not, however, be just a token tribute\r\nto the great undertaking of 50 years ago. It is only natural\r\nthat, on this occasion, Governments should endeavour to\r\nanalyse the successes and failures of the United Nations\r\nover five decades, to ask themselves whether we have come\r\ncloser to fulfilling, in the practice of international relations,\r\nthe principles proclaimed in the Charter, and to look to the\r\nyears ahead in order to try to chart our new priorities in a\r\nrapidly changing world.\r\nThis Organization was brought into being by the\r\nvision, the hope and the determination of men and women\r\nwho experienced at first hand the lethal dangers of\r\nnationalism, economic depression, lost freedom and\r\ndevastating war — men and women who realized the need\r\nto create mechanisms that would allow States to embark\r\nupon a collective effort in dealing with a wide range of\r\ncomplex international issues.\r\nLooking back over the 50 years since the guns of the\r\nSecond World War fell silent, one notes with satisfaction\r\nthe valuable work performed by the United Nations as a\r\nforum for debate on matters of international concern, and\r\nas a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in the\r\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields.\r\nThe United Nations has played a vital role as a\r\nframework for the historical process of decolonization, by\r\nsecuring international recognition for the new countries and\r\nby helping them improve their economic and social\r\nconditions. It has defined human rights for the global\r\ncommunity. It has defeated the shameful practice of\r\napartheid. It has provided the basis for an intensive\r\ndevelopment of international law. It has monitored elections\r\nin countries where elections have seldom been held. It has\r\nassisted in the drafting of constitutions, and has trained\r\nindigenous police forces. It has moved forward consensus\r\non global problems such as disarmament, the\r\nenvironment, the status of women, human rights,\r\ndevelopment and many other fundamental issues.\r\nFurthermore, the specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system have achieved major successes in their\r\ndifferent spheres of activity, and have provided invaluable\r\nhumanitarian and other assistance in distressed areas of\r\nthe world.\r\nDespite this creditable record, it is the shortcomings\r\nof the United Nations that receive the greatest attention.\r\nI will certainly not argue that the achievements of those\r\npast 50 years yield any ground whatsoever for\r\ncomplacency. However, while disappointment has been\r\nfrequently expressed at the Organization’s performance,\r\nno credible alternative is offered by those who criticize it.\r\nMoreover, little regard is given to the innumerable\r\nconstraints under which it operates, as well as to the fact\r\nthat it can be only as effective as Governments allow it to\r\nbe. The United Nations has indeed structural deficiencies,\r\nwhich it urgently needs to overcome. But it is too often\r\na useful scapegoat for the mistakes, the failings and the\r\nunfulfilled promises of Member States.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his highly acclaimed and\r\nvery timely report entitled “Supplement to an Agenda\r\nfor Peace\u0027”, issued earlier this year, has underlined the\r\ngreat problems presented to the United Nations by the\r\nnew generation of post-cold-war conflicts, for which the\r\nOrganization was obviously unprepared. He has pointed\r\nout that, for instance, in the framework of its peace-\r\nkeeping activities, the Organization has had, in some\r\ncases, to juggle efforts to combine mandates, including\r\nthe use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter, with\r\nthe basic principle of neutrality and impartiality of the\r\nUnited Nations and the lack of adequate resources to\r\neffectively implement that mandate. In the same context,\r\nshortcomings in the unity of command which we have\r\nwitnessed in the case of some peace-keeping operations\r\nhave also contributed to undermining the effectiveness of\r\nUnited Nations action.\r\nThe financial crisis in general has also been\r\nparticularly debilitating as regards the activities of the\r\nOrganization in all areas. The Secretary-General has often\r\nquestioned the credibility of those Member States that\r\nsupport the ends, by actively participating in the decision-\r\nmaking process, but not the means, by failing to pay their\r\nassessed contribution. Nobody denies the fact that\r\nconsiderable progress can still be achieved with regard to\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nthe effective use of resources that are already available. But\r\nunless the necessary financial means are provided, it would\r\nbe folly to expect miracles from the Organization.\r\nEliminating waste and inefficiency, through better\r\nmanagement and accountability, essential though it may be,\r\nwill never be a substitute for ensuring adequate and regular\r\nfunding.\r\nThe increasing resort to, and use, of sanctions regimes\r\nhas brought to light another series of difficulties which have\r\nalso undermined the credibility of the United Nations. As\r\nthe Secretary-General pointed out in his report, the\r\nobjectives for which specific sanctions regimes were\r\nimposed and the criteria for their lifting have not been\r\nclearly defined, or have seemed to change over time, as has\r\nbeen the case for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro) and Iraq. This situation is all the\r\nmore worrying because experience has proved that the\r\nimposition of sanctions results in the infliction of\r\ntremendous suffering upon vulnerable groups of the\r\ntargeted country, rather than in the modification of the\r\nbehaviour of its Government.\r\nFurthermore, the role of those countries that shoulder\r\nthe main burden of the implementation of the sanctions\r\nregimes, despite the considerable collateral damage which\r\nthey suffer in terms of economic and social costs, needs, at\r\nlast, to be appropriately acknowledged, for their\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity is, in some cases, no less important than that of\r\ntroop-contributing countries. It should be clear that if, in the\r\nlong run, the difficulties of those Member States that have\r\nthe misfortune to be neighbours of the targeted countries\r\nare not dealt with in a satisfactory way, inter alia, through\r\nthe appropriate implementation of Article 50 of the Charter,\r\nthen general support for the use of sanctions as an effective\r\ninstrument will not be easily maintained.\r\nRegrettably, one would have to acknowledge that the\r\nprimary purpose of the United Nations — that of\r\nestablishing a pattern of world order and international\r\nsecurity — has been achieved to a much lesser degree than\r\nhad been expected, or is indeed required by the growing\r\nneeds of the international community. The threat and the\r\nuse of force are still a recurrent feature of international\r\nrelations, contrary to the expectations raised in 1945. The\r\nterritorial integrity or the sovereign rights of States are\r\nfrequently threatened or compromised by the practice of\r\npower politics, in contravention of the purposes and\r\nprinciples that govern our Organization.\r\nIn this context, allow me to observe that a charter is\r\nof value in so far as each member that subscribes to it\r\nconducts itself in accordance with the commitments it has\r\nundertaken of its own free will, without guile or\r\nreservations. It is also of paramount importance that the\r\nUnited Nations should not be perceived as resorting to\r\ndouble standards when it comes to military aggression\r\nand other blatant violations of international law.\r\nThe guiding principle of Greek foreign policy is the\r\nestablishment of good-neighbourly relations with all\r\ncountries of the region, on the basis of respect for\r\ninternational law, national sovereignty and human rights,\r\nand on non-interference in the internal affairs of other\r\nStates. This principle has always constituted the\r\ncornerstone of our foreign policy and applies fully to our\r\nrelations with neighbouring Turkey. It is the sincere wish\r\nof my Government that Greek-Turkish relations be\r\nnormalized, on the basis of the principles of international\r\nlaw and the relevant international treaties, and in\r\nconformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the\r\nHelsinki Document and the Charter of Paris for a New\r\nEurope. Greece has never raised any claims against\r\nTurkey. On the other hand, we have made it absolutely\r\nclear that we categorically reject any idea of\r\ncompromising our sovereign rights, which we are\r\ndetermined to protect by all legitimate means.\r\nUnfortunately, Turkey is following a different\r\napproach in its policies vis-à-vis our country. To cite just\r\none example, I wish to refer to the resolution adopted on\r\n8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly,\r\nauthorizing the Turkish Government to use military force\r\nin case Greece exercised its legal right to expand its\r\nterritorial waters to 12 nautical miles, according to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The\r\nsaid resolution was obviously endorsed by the Turkish\r\nGovernment, since it was forwarded to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on 23 June 1995 in a letter addressed to him by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Turkey to the United\r\nNations.\r\nTurkey is in fact attempting to intimidate Greece\r\ninto forfeiting a right acknowledged to all signatory\r\nparties, by article 3 of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea of 1982, and already exercised by a\r\nlarge number of States. Furthermore, it is beyond any\r\ndoubt that the above-mentioned resolution constitutes a\r\ndirect violation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, which stipulates that\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\n“All Members shall refrain in their international\r\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the\r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any\r\nState”,\r\nas well as of many similar provisions of international\r\ntreaties and conventions.\r\nIt is self-evident that an essential improvement of\r\nGreek-Turkish relations presupposes a just and lasting\r\nsolution of the Cyprus question and the re-establishment of\r\ninternational legality in Cyprus. Unfortunately, during the\r\nlast 21 years, the Turkish forces, defying a series of United\r\nNations resolutions, have occupied a large part of Cyprus,\r\ndespite the assiduous efforts of the Secretary-General. Their\r\ncontinuing presence has resulted in the division of the\r\nisland by force, the brutal violation of human rights and\r\nfreedoms, and the systematic plundering of the island’s\r\ncultural and religious heritage.\r\nThe Greek Government strongly supports the efforts\r\nof the Secretary-General with a view to a just and viable\r\nsolution of the Cyprus problem, on the basis of the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including the most recent one,\r\nresolution 939 (1994), which calls for a bi-communal and\r\nbi-zonal federal State of Cyprus with single sovereignty and\r\ninternational personality and single citizenship, with its\r\nindependence and territorial integrity safeguarded. The\r\nGreek Government believes that the prospect of the\r\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union, which was\r\nfurther promoted by concrete actions taken by the Union in\r\nthe course of 1995, will create conditions that would make\r\nit possible to tackle the current deadlock and, thus, assist\r\neffectively the Secretary-General’s efforts for the reversal\r\nof the unacceptable status quo.\r\nOne should also bear in mind that no progress towards\r\na settlement is possible as long as the Turkish occupation\r\nforces remain on the island. The Greek Government\r\nconsiders the proposal for the total demilitarization of the\r\nisland, put forward by President Clerides, as most\r\nconstructive. It also feels that it is imperative that countries\r\nwhich are in a position to back the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and wish to do so should exert the necessary\r\npressure so that the side which is responsible for the\r\nimpasse will be forced to abide by international law and\r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nThe signing of the Interim Accord, on 13 September\r\n1995, in New York, constitutes an important step towards\r\nestablishing a new era in relations between Greece and the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It also paves the\r\nway for bilateral cooperation for their own benefit, as\r\nwell as for the sake of peace, cooperation, stability and\r\nprosperity throughout the Balkans, which has been so\r\naffected by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe do hope that this preliminary significant step in\r\nthe relations between the two countries will lead to a\r\ndefinite settlement of the dispute over the name, which\r\nconstitutes the main difference existing between them and\r\nwhich will be dealt with in the context of further\r\nnegotiations, in accordance with the conventional\r\ncommitment of the parties concerned and the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nGreece attaches great importance to its relations with\r\nAlbania. For this reason, we constantly follow a policy of\r\ngood- neighbourliness and cooperation with that country\r\nand continue to support, in many ways, its efforts to\r\npromote political and economic reforms and thus\r\ncontribute to the establishment of a modern and\r\ndemocratic society.\r\nGreece has been offering substantial economic\r\nsupport to Albania, which has enabled it to face the many\r\ndifficult problems that arose after the former regime was\r\noverthrown. Today, Greek investments in Albania\r\ncontinue to contribute substantially to the country’s\r\neconomic development and to the strengthening of its\r\nsocial stability.\r\nFurthermore, a large Greek minority lives in\r\nAlbania, contributing positively to the country’s\r\ndevelopment. Under the previous regime, this minority\r\nwas subjected to persecution and harsh treatment. Greece\r\nis convinced that the Greek minority in Albania\r\nconstitutes a bridge of friendship between the two\r\ncountries and helps further their rapprochement and\r\ncooperation. For this reason, we believe that the human\r\nrights of the members of that minority should be fully\r\nrespected, so that they are able to stay in their homeland\r\nand live there in a safe environment. Moreover, they\r\nshould be proportionally represented in the administration,\r\nthe State institutions and the armed forces, and be\r\nallowed to exercise their religious and educational rights\r\nfreely and fully.\r\nUnfortunately, notwithstanding some improvements,\r\nconsiderable restrictions continue to apply to the free\r\nexercise of these rights, particularly in the field of\r\neducation. We sincerely hope that the Albanian\r\nGovernment, in conformity also with its international\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\ncommitments, will secure full respect for the human rights\r\nof the Greek minority.\r\nDuring the current year, the tragedy of the former\r\nYugoslavia has continued to unfold relentlessly, imposing\r\ntremendous suffering and hardships on the civilian\r\npopulation. Greece, as a country neighbouring the former\r\nYugoslavia, has been directly subjected to the negative\r\nconsequences of this bloody conflict, as regards both its\r\neconomy and its security.\r\nMy country has always advocated that, as has already\r\nbeen pointed out by the presidency of the European Union,\r\na fair and viable solution to the conflict in Bosnia can be\r\nfound only by political means, and not on the battlefields.\r\nThis is why from the beginning of the crisis we have\r\nspared no effort to ensure that all the parties involved\r\nmoved in the direction of trying to promote a peaceful\r\nsettlement, in cooperation with our European partners and\r\nRussia, which has played, and is to play, a significant role\r\nin this issue. Furthermore, the Greek Government fully\r\nsupports the current diplomatic initiative and the ongoing\r\nnegotiating process based on the Contact Group plan.\r\nRecently, there have been encouraging developments\r\nregarding the future shape of things in the former\r\nYugoslavia. The parties have begun to show signs of\r\nrapprochement and willingness to talk. Thus, we warmly\r\nwelcome the Basic Principles, agreed in Geneva on 8\r\nSeptember 1995, and the Further Basic Principles, agreed\r\nthree days ago in New York, which are very important\r\nsteps on the long and difficult road to peace. Much remains\r\nto be done, but if the parties display the necessary political\r\nwill and with the assistance of the international community\r\na comprehensive and viable peaceful settlement should no\r\nlonger be a fictitious objective, whose attainment would\r\ntake a very long time.\r\nGreece, for its part, is ready to contribute to the\r\nfulfilment of this objective through the good relations that\r\nit has developed with all the parties involved in the conflict.\r\nFurthermore, my country, fully aware of the intricacies of\r\nthe Balkans and having actively participated in the\r\ninitiatives for regional economic cooperation, will do its\r\nutmost, both on a national basis and in the framework of\r\nthe European Union, to promote efforts aiming at the\r\nreconstruction of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nConcerning the situation in the Middle East, Greece\r\nconsiders as a matter of utmost importance the early and\r\nunimpeded implementation of the recent Erez and Taba\r\nAgreements and the speedy conclusion of the talks on\r\nredeployment and elections, together with the solution of\r\nthe two outstanding problems, namely security for all, and\r\nsocial and economic development.\r\nWe welcome the signature yesterday in Washington\r\nby Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\r\nof the interim agreement on the second stage of\r\nPalestinian autonomy, which constitutes additional proof\r\nof determination and political courage. We congratulate\r\nthe Israeli Government and Chairman Arafat on their\r\ncommitment to peace.\r\nGreece believes that the international community\r\nmust exert consistent efforts, in which we are willing to\r\nactively participate, aiming at the creation of a solid basis\r\nfor the political and economic survival of the Palestinian\r\nNational Authority, thereby providing a source of hope\r\nfor the Palestinian people.\r\nGreece is of the view that the peace process could\r\nbe substantially promoted if the States of the region\r\ndirectly involved in it joined forces with those actively\r\nparticipating, and we welcome all recent indications to\r\nthis effect. The peoples of the region should be\r\nguaranteed a secure life, within internationally recognized\r\nand safe boundaries.\r\nWe urge the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978) on Lebanon.\r\nGreece, which has actively participated in the Middle\r\nEast peace process since it began in Madrid, will continue\r\nto offer full support and assistance to the bilateral and\r\nmultilateral negotiations towards a comprehensive, final\r\nand just peace.\r\nGreece believes that an increase in the number of\r\nmembers of the Security Council has become an\r\nimperative necessity. Such an increase, which should be\r\nmoderate so as not to undermine the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil’s action, must reflect the current number of\r\nStates that are Members of the United Nations, the\r\nrealities of the new international situation and an\r\nequitable distribution among all existing regional groups.\r\nWhile recognizing that any formal definition of criteria\r\nfor new permanent members could not be easily\r\nformulated, we consider that new members of this\r\ncategory should be selected from among States that exert\r\na major influence in world affairs and are in a position to\r\nmake an essential contribution to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nGreece welcomes the indefinite extension of the\r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the commitment made\r\nby the States parties to its universalization and full\r\nimplementation. We emphasize the importance of\r\nstrengthening the review process and adopting a set of\r\nprinciples and objectives for non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament. We also stress the need to complete without\r\ndelay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-\r\nweapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile\r\nmaterial for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive\r\ndevices.\r\nWe are deeply concerned at the continued dangers\r\nposed by the excessive transfer of conventional arms, and\r\nwe support putting the United Nations Register fully into\r\neffect. Furthermore, the continuing injuries to civilians\r\ncaused by anti-personnel mines demonstrate the need to\r\nstrengthen multilateral controls in this regard.\r\nGrowing economic and social gaps breed violence.\r\nThe need to bridge the differences between rich and poor,\r\nboth between nations and within nations, is of the utmost\r\nimportance for our efforts and opportunities to preserve\r\npeace. This fundamental truth was recognized and stressed\r\nby the founders of the United Nations and, subsequently, by\r\nall members of the Organization, who pledged to “employ\r\ninternational machinery for the promotion of the economic\r\nand social advancement of all peoples”.\r\nIn responding to the changing needs of the\r\nincreasingly interdependent world economy, we have to\r\nreinforce the coherence and effectiveness of the competent\r\ninternational institutions and to complete without delay our\r\nconsideration of the “Agenda for Development”, thus\r\nsetting out a new impetus to international cooperation in\r\nthis field and defining the particular contribution expected\r\nof the United Nations system.\r\nThere is an increasing realization worldwide that in\r\nmajor denials of human rights, which breed antagonisms\r\nand deep resentments, there lie the seeds of international\r\ndiscord as surely as in the clashes of economic rivalries and\r\nterritorial ambitions. In this regard, Greece strongly\r\ncondemns all forms of discrimination and intolerance, and\r\nreaffirms its full support for the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and his coordinating role\r\nthroughout the United Nations system, as well as for the\r\nstrengthening of the Centre for Human Rights. The\r\nprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\r\nand also those of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction, as well as of the other international acts and\r\ninstruments, should guide the actions of all Member\r\nStates in this respect on a daily basis.\r\nIndustrialization and the technological revolution,\r\nwhile bringing benefits to the human race, have also\r\ngiven rise to side effects, namely the problems of the\r\ndevastation of the natural environment. In this context, the\r\nimportance of meeting the commitments we made at the\r\n1992 Rio Earth Summit, and the need to review and\r\nstrengthen them, where appropriate, cannot be\r\noverstressed. Strengthening national institutions\r\nresponsible for environmental management, and\r\nsupporting international organizations that focus on\r\nenvironmental issues, will be vital in maintaining and\r\nincreasing the momentum for the protection and the\r\nimprovement of the environment.\r\nTroops and civilian personnel engaged in United\r\nNations peace-keeping and humanitarian activities have\r\nbeen carrying out their most important tasks under\r\nconditions of extraordinary personal risk, and very often\r\nat the expense of their own lives. I would like to\r\ncondemn, in the strongest possible terms, the abhorrent\r\nand unacceptable harassment of and attacks against\r\nUnited Nations peace-keepers, to whose relentless courage\r\nand determination we pay tribute. I should also like to\r\nstress the need for measures which will ensure their\r\nsecurity, including the early entry into force of the\r\nrecently adopted Convention for the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel.\r\nThese past 50 years of United Nations existence\r\nhave been a time of unparalleled human advancement and\r\nof the fundamental enlargement of human expectations.\r\nAs I see it, it will be the principal task of the\r\nOrganization, which has done so much to give voice to\r\nthose expectations, to take the lead in bringing them ever\r\ncloser to realization.\r\nGreece, as a small country, has always had a strong\r\nvested interest in the strengthening of the common\r\ncapacity to deal with threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity and, in general, in the success of the United\r\nNations. The Greek people will always be supportive of\r\na collective approach to global and regional problems. For\r\nmy part, I can only reaffirm our resolve to extend our full\r\ncooperation to the efforts of the Organization as it strives\r\nfor the realization of its noble objectives, and our\r\ncontinued dedication to its purposes and principles.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nWorship of Bolivia, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Aranibar\r\nQuiroga.\r\nMr. Aranibar Quiroga (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me to convey to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly the congratulations of the Government\r\nand people of Bolivia upon his election to the presidency of\r\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. He can be\r\nassured that my delegation will cooperate with him to\r\nensure the full success of this important session.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the United Nations Charter affords a\r\nfresh opportunity for critical and renewed reflection on the\r\nscope, difficulties and role of the multilateral system.\r\nDuring the year 1995 important meetings of universal\r\nscope have taken place, such as the World Summit on\r\nSocial Development, the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, and the Review and Extension Conference on the\r\nTreaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Those\r\nmeetings, together with others of a bilateral, subregional or\r\nregional character — notably the Hemispheric Summit in\r\nMiami — show that the principles which presided over the\r\ncreation of the United Nations are still very much alive, and\r\ndemonstrate the need to make significant further headway\r\nin promoting peace, human rights, democracy, and\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMeetings at the highest level of the world’s political\r\nleaders and their representatives, ready to assume\r\nundertakings on issues of such significance, are indicative\r\nof a strong political will and reveal an interest in finding\r\nconcrete collective responses to the problems of our time.\r\nAs a result of those Conferences, the world\r\ncommunity has at hand new approaches that enrich and\r\nstrengthen prior agreements as it seeks to cope successfully\r\nwith contemporary challenges. For example, social\r\ndevelopment and recognition of the due role of women in\r\nsociety have ceased to be mere promises; they are\r\nbecoming definite realities before the end of this century.\r\nThe International Decade of the World’s Indigenous\r\nPeople will make it possible for priority attention to be\r\ngiven to that important sector of the community.\r\nThe end of the cold war has not released the material\r\nand human resources that were committed to that contest.\r\nNor has it freed our minds of concern over war and\r\ndestruction. There persist negative situations and\r\nprejudices, which were born during that period when the\r\nworld was divided into antagonistic blocs, and which no\r\nlonger have any justification.\r\nThe long-awaited peace dividend has not been\r\nforthcoming; on the contrary, we see a proliferation of\r\nconflicts in many parts of the world. Many of these\r\nsituations are due to still unresolved social and national\r\nproblems, to a backlog of injustices and long-standing\r\nresentments, to geopolitical and economic interests which,\r\nfrom within and from outside, have exacerbated\r\nconfrontation for decades, and, above all, to\r\nGovernments’ difficulties in defining an effective form of\r\ncooperation for the peaceful solution of problems.\r\nIn this context, we reiterate our support for the\r\nprinciples and the renewed objectives of the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries, whose chairmanship is shortly to\r\nbe assumed by the sister republic of Colombia.\r\nWe feel a sense of solidarity with the peoples of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, who are enduring the torment of an\r\nunjustifiable war. We also express our solidarity with the\r\nmillions of human beings affected by military conflict,\r\nunilateral blockades, hindrances to free contact with the\r\noutside world, and by having been uprooted from their\r\nlands.\r\nWe reiterate what the Heads of State or Government\r\nof the Rio Group stated at their recent summit meeting in\r\nQuito:\r\n“We express our concern over attempts to\r\nenforce domestic laws beyond territorial boundaries\r\nin violation of international law and the fundamental\r\nprinciples governing coexistence in the region. Such\r\nactions violate the sovereignty of other States and\r\nare contrary to unanimously adopted transparent\r\ntrade practices”. (A/50/425, annex, para. 13)\r\nBolivia expresses its condemnation of grave\r\nviolations of international law, war crimes, violations of\r\nthe fundamental rules of coexistence, manifestations of\r\nracism, and other offenses against humanity, all of which\r\nshould be vigorously condemned. The work of the United\r\nNations in this field has been important, but it needs to be\r\nfurther refined. In that work, the role of regional and\r\nsubregional organizations for cooperation and\r\ncoordination is essential and should gain greater\r\nimportance in years to come. These organizations include\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nthe Organization of American States, the Rio Group and the\r\nvarious regional and subregional instruments of economic\r\nintegration, to which my Government lends its full support.\r\nWe rejoice that Haiti and other countries have made\r\nfirm strides towards peace and democratic governance.\r\nLikewise, Bolivia notes with particular interest, and\r\ncommends, the peace process in the Middle East, whose\r\nadvances in the face of difficulties give us cause to be\r\noptimistic and to hope for reconciliation through the\r\nfashioning of innovative solutions with a distinctive explicit\r\npolitical content. The agreement signed yesterday between\r\nIsrael and Palestine is an example of determination and\r\nvision of historic proportions.\r\nBolivia has expressed its rejection of the resumption\r\nof nuclear tests, which jeopardize negotiations towards the\r\nspeedy adoption of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\r\nWe condemn terrorism and organized crime, whose\r\nscope and reach cut across national boundaries and which\r\nthus threatens security and constitutional stability\r\neverywhere. Bolivia has signed several bilateral treaties\r\nintended to advance international cooperation on legal\r\nmatters within a framework of strict respect for sovereignty,\r\nbut at the same time closing off avenues to impunity for\r\ninternational crime.\r\nAs our awareness of the rights and duties of\r\nmultilateral interdependence grows, cooperation in\r\nachieving the inherent right to development of all the\r\nworld’s peoples should come to the fore.\r\nIn the new international situation, Bolivia supports\r\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening the United Nations and\r\nshares the conviction that it is necessary to carry out major\r\nreforms in its structure and functioning. Bolivia believes it\r\nessential as a first step in that direction to strengthen the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the principal organ providing for\r\neffective participation by all countries.\r\nMy Government supports initiatives aimed at\r\nexpanding the Security Council, in both its permanent and\r\nits non-permanent membership. Such an expansion should\r\nreflect the diversity of the world’s regions and enable all\r\nStates to participate effectively and responsibly in the\r\ncommitment to guarantee peace, security and the timely\r\nsettlement of conflicts, in a transparent manner and in\r\nkeeping with the interests of the international community,\r\nnot only in the narrow framework of the individual interests\r\nof States.\r\nI also highlight the importance we attach to the\r\nUnited Nations in the area of international cooperation,\r\nespecially in the economic sphere and on matters of social\r\nand technological development, and the urgency of\r\nrestoring to the Economic and Social Council the high\r\nstature it originally possessed.\r\nThe principles of justice and international law must\r\nbe our main guiding light in seeking solutions to the\r\nproblems we face.\r\nWith regard to Bolivia’s maritime question, which\r\nwe have brought before international forums, I wish to\r\ndeclare to this Assembly the political will of my\r\nGovernment to embark upon negotiations that are\r\nconsonant with our historic responsibility, that serve the\r\nrights and interests of all parties involved, and that ensure\r\na sovereign Bolivian presence on the Pacific Ocean.\r\nBolivia has to contend with the consequences of the land-\r\nlocked position imposed upon it, the economic, political\r\nand moral effects of which demand a solution in the\r\nframework of international solidarity, justice, equity and\r\nlaw.\r\nJust as countries call for international justice, we are\r\nobliged also to apply that principle within our own\r\nsocieties. That is the golden rule of the Administration of\r\nPresident Gonzalo Sánchez de Losada. Our message is\r\none of change. Never before in the history of our republic\r\nhave such profound and rapid structural changes been\r\ndemocratically and peacefully carried out as those that\r\nbegan in Bolivia in August 1993.\r\nFirst, we are implementing the law on the people’s\r\nparticipation, which is integrating civil society into the\r\npolitical system. Traditionally disadvantaged populations\r\nnow have in their hands the ability to diagnose their\r\nproblems and to prescribe public policy, especially\r\nregarding self-help to meet their own needs. This is\r\nessentially a policy of redistribution, which enables a\r\nlarge part of the nation fully to assume their status as\r\ncitizens.\r\nSecondly, the foregoing requires training the people\r\nso that they will be able to meet internal and external\r\nchallenges. To that end, another reform undertaken by\r\nPresident Gonzálo Sánchez de Lozada’s administration is\r\neducational reform, viewed specifically in the light of\r\nBolivia’s ethnic and cultural diversity and with the aim of\r\ninstitutionalizing bilingual and multicultural education.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nThirdly, I am pleased to inform this Assembly that\r\ncapital investment in Bolivia’s main public enterprises is\r\nmoving forward successfully and strongly. We are\r\ntransforming the largest productive and service units of the\r\ncountry to enable them to double their capital in the space\r\nof a few months, modernize their management in\r\naccordance with the requirements of international life, and\r\nsecure a series of real benefits for the Bolivian population,\r\nmaking possible individual investment by citizens of 50 per\r\ncent of the share capital.\r\nSuch initiatives represent an effort to make Bolivia\r\nequal to contemporary demands, especially those resulting\r\nfrom the international economy, which is characterized by\r\ngreat dynamism, innovation and competitiveness.\r\nInternational economic cooperation is indispensable\r\nand should enjoy the firm political backing of developed\r\ncountries and international financial institutions. For that\r\nreason my country expresses concern about the declining\r\nand negative trends of some sources of cooperation and\r\nfinancing. This situation is especially disturbing when seen\r\nin the light of the fact that Bolivia has to contend in its\r\nterritory with a universal problem — namely, illicit drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nIt is paradoxical — to say the least — to urge an\r\nincrease in Bolivia’s contribution and in Bolivia’s tasks in\r\nthat common struggle precisely at a time when cooperation\r\nresources are decreasing. The task at hand is simultaneously\r\nto fulfil the commitments in the struggle against drug\r\ntrafficking and to prepare to embark on genuine sustainable\r\ndevelopment, especially in the rural sector, where the most\r\nacute poverty exists.\r\nGiven the magnitude of the tasks falling to Bolivia in\r\nthis matter, strong backing from the international\r\ncommunity is needed for Bolivia’s national strategy in\r\nregard to interdiction, prevention, the eradication of surplus\r\ncrops, and alternative development. That contribution is\r\nessential to Bolivia’s effort to cease being a link in the\r\ndrug-trafficking chain and, at the same time, ensure\r\npolitical and economic stability and promote development\r\nof the country’s productive apparatus.\r\nWith a view to consolidating the vision of shared\r\nresponsibility with regard to the problem of drug-\r\ntrafficking, the nations of the Americas support the holding\r\nof a world conference to take stock of the situation and the\r\nstate of international cooperation in the struggle against\r\ndemand for and production, sale, trafficking and illicit\r\ndistribution of narcotics. In that context, Bolivia actively\r\nadvocates the holding in 1977 of a second international\r\nconference against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking,\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nBefore concluding, I must refer to the topic of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe must stimulate vigorous and sustained economic\r\ngrowth, with social equity, in conditions that protect and\r\nmake efficient use of natural resources and ensure rational\r\ndistribution of the fruits of that growth. Henceforth, we\r\nmust adopt a mode of development that is nurtured by\r\ntechnological advances designed to curb the waste and\r\npollution that have characterized industrialized societies.\r\nAccordingly, it is with special satisfaction that I\r\nannounce to this Assembly that in the latter half of next\r\nyear Bolivia will have the privilege of hosting, in the city\r\nof Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the American Hemispheric\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development. We hope that the\r\nideas and proposals that emerge from that important\r\nmeeting will contribute to the development of our\r\ncountries and to better preservation of the environment in\r\nthis part of the world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of\r\nFinance of Samoa, His Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele\r\nMalielegaoi.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): I have to confess to my\r\nusual excitement and pleasure at addressing the General\r\nAssembly, exceptionally crowded and patient even at this\r\nlate hour.\r\nLet me begin by congratulating Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fiftieth session. Mr. Freito do Amaral\r\nrepresents a country with a long history of global\r\nachievements. With his personal qualities and experience,\r\nhe is a very natural choice to guide the work of this\r\nAssembly at such a critical moment.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr.\r\nAmara Essy, for his dedicated and distinguished\r\nstewardship during the last session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI want also to record the gratitude of my\r\nGovernment to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the measure and quality of the\r\nleadership that he continues to provide in the direction\r\nand work of the Organization.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nBarely three weeks ago Hurricane Luis wrought\r\ndevastation on several island countries in the Caribbean,\r\ncausing major setbacks to economic and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, as well as the loss of lives. As we ourselves\r\nrecently experienced two similar disasters, our thoughts and\r\nsympathy are with the people of the Caribbean nations\r\ndevastated by Hurricane Luis, and we pray for their speedy\r\nrecovery.\r\nThe President of the General Assembly, in his opening\r\nremarks, reminded us of the scope of the membership and\r\nthe universal character of this Organization. Samoa is proud\r\nto note that a sister nation of the Pacific, the Republic of\r\nPalau, is the newest Member of the United Nations, and I\r\nam delighted to extend to Palau the warmest of welcomes.\r\nTwo weeks ago the Republic of Palau was acclaimed to\r\nmembership — becoming the sixteenth member — of the\r\nSouth Pacific Forum. That too was a moment of great pride\r\nfor all of us.\r\nWe come together at a special moment for this\r\nOrganization and in the history of international cooperation.\r\nUndeniably, this is a session of exceptional importance. We\r\nneed to take stock of where we, the United Nations, are and\r\nto set new goals and priorities for the future.\r\nSamoa believes that any stocktaking must be rooted in\r\nthe Charter, which proclaims the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Organization. Regrettably, the Charter pledges that we\r\nhave made to succeeding generations remain largely\r\nunfulfilled.\r\nIt is right, and it is natural, therefore that at this\r\nfiftieth session, we, the peoples of the United Nations,\r\nshould seek to renew our commitment to those pledges. But\r\nfirst, it must be remembered that they are pledges that carry\r\nthe attendant duty — a most sacred duty — to make them\r\nrealities. It is a duty imposed upon us all and accepted upon\r\nmembership in our Organization. Far too often, this is\r\nforgotten, or seemingly ignored.\r\nThis session will also be the natural occasion on which\r\nto reaffirm our support for, and our faith in, the United\r\nNations. I speak positively and unhesitatingly about\r\nreaffirmation because, quite frankly, what else is there to\r\ntake the place of the United Nations?\r\nWhat we have is certainly not perfect. And given its\r\nalmost universal make-up, the range of issues before it and\r\nthe increasing demands being made of the United Nations,\r\nit would be surprising if this were the case. Indeed, in\r\nrecent years, all of us in this Assembly have been engaged\r\nin various activities aimed at making the United Nations\r\nmore relevant, more efficient and more cost-effective and\r\nat preparing the Organization for the twenty-first century.\r\nWe welcome in particular resolution 49/252, which was\r\nrecently adopted, on strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem, and we look forward to taking part in the\r\ndiscussions in the Open-ended High-level Working Group\r\nestablished. If and when we have devised changes and\r\nimprovements in the United Nations system, I dare say\r\nthat in years to come it will be necessary to persist in\r\nmonitoring and putting into place further needed reforms\r\nto ensure the sustaining vigour of the Organization. That\r\nbeing the case, there is clearly room for criticism and\r\nfault-finding, from among ourselves as well as from those\r\nwho look on. We do not however think the shortcomings\r\nof the United Nations warrant uninformed cynicism and\r\nunfair blame, nor the charge of irrelevance that is\r\nsometimes levelled at it.\r\nBut clearly, the standing and the very role of the\r\nUnited Nations is at risk if the Members continue to deny\r\nthe Organization the funds and resources it needs. The\r\nSecretary-General has spoken of this matter time and\r\nagain, and once more in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/50/1). The Organization is in a most\r\ncritical financial state, but it is also clear that the situation\r\ncan be substantially improved with the early payment of\r\narrears and by the full and timely payment of assessed\r\ncontributions. We can only urge the most immediate\r\naction on the part of those who know they must act.\r\nSamoa is a small and least-developed country. We\r\nare deeply committed to the United Nations, and we will\r\ncontinue to meet our financial and other responsibilities,\r\nnotwithstanding the budgetary problems we face. We\r\nshare the view that the strongest measures must be taken\r\nto achieve sound financial viability for this Organization.\r\nIt would be essential for this purpose that there be a fair,\r\nmore equitable and realistic scale of assessments, one\r\nwhich would take full account of the principle of capacity\r\nto pay.\r\nThis must also take into account the predicament of\r\nsome countries, including my own, which are assessed at\r\nthe floor rate of the scale, at levels far beyond their\r\ncapacity to pay. We believe there is a just case for\r\nabolishing or reducing the current floor rate. This is a\r\nmatter of importance to many small States and we would\r\nhope that the High-level Working Group on the Financial\r\nSituation of the United Nations would continue to give it\r\ndue consideration.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nThere is a second aspect, which touches on the\r\nemphasis now being given to United Nations peace-keeping\r\nactivities. While Samoa recognizes the necessary and\r\ntraditional role of the United Nations in promoting global\r\npeace and security, it seems to us that ultimately no amount\r\nof force and no measure of peace-keeping can sustain peace\r\nand security without attention to the root causes. Our own\r\nview is that human misery brought about by poverty and\r\nthe denial of human and democratic rights are often the real\r\nand fundamental problems. Unless these are removed or\r\nminimized, there can never be the substratum that we need\r\nfor lasting world peace and security.\r\nPut simply, Samoa believes firmly that social and\r\neconomic development must remain a major preoccupation\r\nof the United Nations, as pledged in the Charter.\r\nDevelopment priorities spelt out in recent global\r\nconferences for the sustained economic and social\r\nadvancement of the developing countries should be\r\neffectively implemented. They should not be ignored while\r\nthe Organization’s attention and its focus, in terms of\r\nhuman and financial resources, is diverted elsewhere,\r\nlargely on peace-keeping activities.\r\nFor Samoa and other small island States disadvantaged\r\nby their size and geographical location, the Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development on Small Island\r\nDeveloping States must remain a centrepiece of our\r\nattention.\r\nWe welcome steps taken by the various organs of the\r\nUnited Nations system to implement the Plan of Action.\r\nWe appreciate, in particular, what is being done by the\r\nDepartment for Policy Co-ordination and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the Unit set up to monitor the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. These steps\r\nwill complement efforts undertaken by our regional\r\ncountries in the South Pacific region to further advance the\r\ncommitments made in Rio, Barbados and elsewhere.\r\nSamoa’s commitment to the pursuit of global peace\r\nand security is unwavering. We will continue to do what\r\nwe can. Conflicts which continue to rage in many regions\r\nof the world today cannot be ignored. They affect us all,\r\nfor they impact directly or indirectly on the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to respond\r\nto the development needs of others.\r\nWe welcome the latest initiatives with a view to\r\nbringing a peaceful end to the conflict in Bosnia. A\r\nsettlement acceptable to all parties must be reached.\r\nAnother milestone in the Middle East peace process\r\nwas reached in Washington yesterday. With the rest of\r\nthe world, we celebrate and commend the enduring efforts\r\nand commitments made by the Israeli and Palestinian\r\nleaders to lasting peace and security for all in that region.\r\nOur environment is of vital importance, and of\r\nsingular concern to my Government. Our actions in the\r\nregion and at the international level are dictated by a deep\r\ncommitment to preserving it. Together with other\r\ncountries in our region, we have initiated and concluded\r\na series of treaty regimes, including those designed to\r\nprotect the natural resources and environment of the\r\nSouth Pacific region and to establish the South Pacific\r\nnuclear-free zone to keep our region free of\r\nenvironmental pollution by radioactive wastes and other\r\nradioactive matter.\r\nWe will continue to supplement these efforts as the\r\nneed arises. Indeed, leaders at the recent South Pacific\r\nForum meeting in Papua New Guinea adopted the Treaty\r\non the Control and Movement of Hazardous and Toxic\r\nWastes in the South Pacific. Samoa did not hesitate to\r\nsign it.\r\nConsistently over the years Samoa, together with our\r\nregional partners, has called for a permanent end to\r\nnuclear testing, the dumping of chemical and toxic wastes\r\nand the transportation of these materials in our waters.\r\nFrom this account you will therefore understand our\r\ndeep shock and distress when it was announced in June\r\nthat France proposed to resume the testing of nuclear\r\nweapons in the Pacific. We sought, at the highest level,\r\nas many others did, to persuade the Government of\r\nFrance not to do so. We took action to register our\r\nconcern and to protest and we sought to intervene in the\r\nproceedings brought by New Zealand against France in\r\nthe International Court of Justice. Together with other\r\nForum countries we moved to make direct representation\r\nto the Government of France — all to no avail.\r\nThe explosion of a nuclear device at Mururoa atoll\r\nearly this month brings to close to 200 the number of\r\nunderground nuclear tests France has carried out in the\r\nPacific since 1975. Of the whole United Nations\r\nmembership, Samoa is the closest to the test site.\r\nThe resumption of nuclear testing by France has\r\nbeen made in the face of strong and persistent protest\r\nfrom countries of the region, and equally strong and\r\noverwhelming condemnation from all parts of the world.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nThe current tests are being conducted in the absence of any\r\nenvironmental impact assessments that we know of or have\r\nbeen advised of, and in the opinion of my Government in\r\ndisregard of France’s existing regional treaty obligations.\r\nLike other members of the South Pacific Forum, Samoa is\r\noutraged at the resumption of French nuclear testing in the\r\nPacific — and, as I say, in the vicinity of my country. In\r\nthe strongest possible terms we condemn it. We do so\r\nbecause of the extreme danger it poses to our environment\r\nand health, now and in the long term; and because the tests\r\nare completely contrary to the undertaking at the recent\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty review Conference that nuclear\r\nStates exercise utmost restraint in nuclear testing pending\r\nthe completion of negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty that would ban nuclear tests for all time.\r\nWe do welcome France’s commitment to a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, but that should not be used\r\nas an excuse for France to continue its nuclear testing in\r\nour region. For the sake of our environment and all who\r\nlive there, we call on France to stop.\r\nWe call also, and once more, on the three nuclear\r\nPowers which have not yet signed and ratified the Protocols\r\nto the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty to do so.\r\nIt is also out of deep concern for our environment that\r\nSamoa has taken every step possible to be engaged in the\r\nnegotiations and in the implementation of the international\r\nconventions relating to climate change, biodiversity, marine\r\npollution and the conservation of straddling and highly\r\nmigratory fish stocks. Global warming and the threat of\r\nsea-level rise are matters of the gravest concern to my\r\ncountry and our region. Recently, the Intergovernmental\r\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the warming\r\nof the global atmosphere is unlikely to be entirely due to\r\nnatural causes. In other words, human activity is a definite\r\ncause that cannot be discounted.\r\nWhile this is not entirely unexpected, the latest\r\nindication from the IPCC bears out the inadequacy of\r\ncurrent Convention commitments for Annex I parties, and\r\nunderlines the essential correctness, and the urgency, of the\r\nBerlin Mandate issued from the first Conference of the\r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change. For its part, Samoa will continue to work\r\ntogether with countries of the Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates (AOSIS) towards the early acceptance of clear\r\nemission-reduction targets of the type advanced in the draft\r\nAOSIS Protocol.\r\nIn respect of fish stocks, let me take the opportunity\r\nto pay tribute to all the countries that worked so hard to\r\nproduce the truly remarkable triumph in the form of the\r\ndraft Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\r\nIn particular, we express our gratitude to Ambassador\r\nSatya Nandan of Fiji for his exceptional skill and\r\nchairmanship.\r\nThis has been a landmark year on many counts; with\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary commemoration we will celebrate\r\nnext month the crowning event.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, in\r\nBeijing, is one such landmark. Samoa warmly applauds\r\nthe unanimous adoption of the Platform for Action, and\r\nthe remarkable degree of international consultation and\r\ncooperation that was employed to produce it. What is\r\nneeded now is the highest degree of commitment and\r\naction, in close consultation with women at all levels.\r\nThere would be little point in having yet another fine\r\ndocument without any prospect of implementation, and\r\nwithout the effort and the will to make concrete changes\r\nand improvements. And let it be remembered that such\r\nchanges and improvements are not for women alone, but\r\nfor the full development of mankind.\r\nWithout doubt, the extension of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty was a major achievement for the\r\nworld community this year. We congratulate Ambassador\r\nDhanapala of Sri Lanka on his remarkable role and\r\nleadership in ensuring the successful outcome of the\r\nReview Conference.\r\nThe decisions we took then are essential to\r\ninternational peace and security, and the attainment of the\r\nultimate goals of the complete elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons and a treaty on general and complete\r\ndisarmament under strict and effective international\r\ncontrol. The successful conclusion of a comprehensive\r\nnuclear-test-ban treaty by 1996 is a specific goal for the\r\nattainment of which all Member States of this body\r\nshould strive with the utmost effort.\r\nWe pray that at the end of the presidency of\r\nAmbassador Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, the world\r\ncommunity will be able to celebrate the accomplishment\r\nof that objective.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Colombia, His Excellency Mr. Rodrigo\r\nPardo Garcia-Peña.\r\nMr. Pardo Garcia-Peña (Colombia)(interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): On behalf of my Government I congratulate\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session,\r\na crucial time in the history of the Organization. I should\r\nlike at the outset to express our full readiness to make a\r\nmajor contribution to the success of the deliberations under\r\nhis leadership.\r\nI should also like to express our appreciation and\r\ngratitude to Minister Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire for his\r\nexcellent performance as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-ninth session.\r\nThe peoples of the world believed that the end of the\r\ncold war would bring peace and prosperity — and they are\r\nstill waiting. Indeed the changes that have taken place in\r\ninternational relations have not been accompanied by\r\nchanges of a similar magnitude in the relations between the\r\nindustrialized North and the impoverished South. On the\r\ncontrary, the situation of developing countries, far from\r\nhaving improved, is deteriorating further. The international\r\ntrade system does not meet the expectations that there\r\nwould be access to markets and transparency in the rules of\r\nthe game. Poverty has not been reduced, social\r\ndevelopment is at a standstill, the scientific and\r\ntechnological development of the South continues to lag\r\nand the external debt problem is still a heavy burden on our\r\neconomies.\r\nIt is our duty now to realize the dream of those who\r\nwrote the San Francisco Charter — something that has been\r\npostponed for 50 years by a cold war and dozens of\r\nregional conflicts and overshadowed by the grief of the\r\nvictims of armed conflicts.\r\nThe period of transition through which the\r\ninternational system is passing should not lead us to accept\r\nso-called unilateral solutions to problems that are global in\r\nnature nor to permit the emergence of a new era of\r\nintervention in matters that lie within the domestic\r\njurisdiction of States. There is an imperative need to\r\nconcert policies and coordinate strategies to face\r\ninternational problems and to foster constructive links\r\nbetween North and South.\r\nThe United Nations, which was a stage for the cold\r\nwar, must now cooperate in eradicating poverty, in\r\nmaking sustainable human development viable, in\r\nguaranteeing equality of rights between men and women\r\nand in giving full effect to human rights — in other\r\nwords, it must work on behalf of human beings — all\r\nhuman beings — without distinction of any kind\r\nwhatsoever. The United Nations has the responsibility to\r\nstrive to make the hopes and expectations that arose at the\r\nend of the cold war a reality and not the source of new\r\nfrustrations.\r\nThe current situation requires a modern United\r\nNations attuned to the new times, a pluralistic and\r\ndemocratic Organization that will be an instrument for the\r\npromotion of a world order that can make the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality and achieve peace. The building of\r\na new international system to replace the hegemonic,\r\nweapons-based and unilateral practices of the past is a\r\ngoal towards which we must work from within this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe international system we aspire to create is one\r\ncompatible with interdependence and autonomy, with the\r\nstrengthening of the international organization and with\r\nfull respect for the sovereign equality of States, one\r\ncompatible with economic development and devoted to\r\nthe significant improvement of the living conditions of the\r\npoorest segments of the population.\r\nIt is indispensable to forge a new economic model\r\nthat can satisfy the needs of our people, one characterized\r\nby social justice and equity, efficiency and\r\ncompetitiveness. At the same time, we are convinced that\r\ngenuine and representative democracy, free from foreign\r\ninterference, must be the key element in preserving peace\r\nand observing the basic principles of respect for the\r\nfundamental rights of the human person and of economic\r\nand social development.\r\nFor the preservation of peace, security and\r\ninternational stability it is indispensable that the nuclear-\r\nweapon States act responsibly and immediately\r\ndiscontinue nuclear testing. In this regard, we deplore the\r\nrecent nuclear tests that have been carried out,\r\nnotwithstanding the opposition of the international\r\ncommunity to that practice.\r\nNext month the Eleventh Summit Meeting of the\r\nmembers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will\r\ntake place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. My country\r\nlooks forward to the attendance of leaders of developing\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nnations and is prepared to shoulder the creative challenge\r\nof presiding over the Movement for the next three years.\r\nIn recent decades, under the leadership of His\r\nExcellency President Soeharto of Indonesia, the Non-\r\nAligned Movement adopted a new course, one in tune with\r\ncurrent reality, abandoning the confrontational context in\r\nfavour of cooperation as the central focus of its action. We\r\nshall continue to pursue that task with enthusiasm.\r\nWith the same determination with which it succeeded\r\nin its struggle against colonialism, the non-aligned countries\r\nmust now face the challenge of eradicating poverty and\r\nclosing the vast gap between rich and poor and between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nIn the twenty-first century non-alignment will mean a\r\ncommitment to peace and to the well-being and progress of\r\nour peoples, as well as action against poverty and\r\nmarginalization. It will also entail a commitment to\r\ncooperation in dealing with global problems and a struggle\r\nfor participation and against unilateralism and imposition.\r\nIn facing the next century, non-alignment must\r\nparticipate actively in the reform of international\r\ninstitutions, including the United Nations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. Non-alignment must also promote the\r\nneeded changes in the structures of cooperation and the\r\ndynamic modalities by which developed countries and\r\ninternational institutions provide resources for the\r\nimplementation of projects and programmes of South-South\r\ncooperation.\r\nOne of the global problems that calls for an effective\r\nmultilateral strategy headed by the United Nations is that of\r\nillegal drugs. This is not an issue that can be dealt with by\r\na single country or small group of nations. This is a\r\ntransnational crime of vast proportions, overwhelming\r\ndimensions and the greatest perils. It is a crime without\r\nnationality.\r\nWe Colombians have suffered more than anyone from\r\nthe devastating effects of this problem. We have suffered\r\ndeath and corruption as a consequence of the huge profits\r\nto be derived from this illegal activity. We find it\r\nsurprising, therefore, to note that the international\r\ncommunity is not fully aware of the real nature and\r\ndimensions of the problem of illicit drugs.\r\nWe are dealing with an illegal economic activity with\r\ndimensions that have been compared with those of the oil\r\nindustry. It is seven or eight times greater than the gross\r\nnational product of a nation like Colombia; it operates in\r\ndozens of countries and entails a number of linked\r\nactivities, including money laundering and the deviation\r\nof chemical precursors. Such linked activities generally\r\ntake place in developed countries and are as important as\r\nthe growing of coca leaves or their transformation into\r\ncocaine.\r\nMany studies indicate an increase in the\r\nconsumption of illegal drugs in industrialized countries as\r\nwell as an increase in new markets throughout the world.\r\nWorld statistics demonstrate that deaths from drug abuse\r\nhave trebled since 1988 and that an increase of 1000 per\r\ncent has been observed in medical emergencies due to\r\ncocaine overdose between 1978 and 1993.\r\nMy country has battled, with more success than any\r\nother, against the producers of and traffickers in illegal\r\ndrugs. Colombia eradicated marihuana crops in the 1970s,\r\ndestroyed the Medellín Cartel in the 1980s and dismantled\r\nthe Cali Cartel in the 1990s.\r\nColombia is responsible for more than 50 per cent of\r\nthe poppy crops eradicated worldwide and for the\r\nconfiscation of more than a quarter of the total amount of\r\ncocaine and cocaine base seized globally.\r\nThe eradication of illegal crops in Colombia must be\r\naccompanied by similar efforts to bring about the\r\neradication of marihuana crops in other countries,\r\nincluding in some industrialized countries in the North.\r\nDuring the first year of President Ernesto Samper’s\r\nAdministration, the anti-drug cartel policy has produced\r\nresults that no prior administration in Colombia, or in any\r\nother nation, has been able to achieve.\r\nThanks to Colombia’s success, the world now has a\r\nhistoric opportunity to defeat drug trafficking once and\r\nfor all. Yet this opportunity could be missed if adequate\r\nmeasures are not immediately adopted to combat money\r\nlaundering, the deviation of precursor chemicals and\r\npermissive consumption.\r\nMy country has proposed creating a special unit of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council to oversee measures of\r\ninternational cooperation, the adoption of an inter-\r\nAmerican convention against money laundering and the\r\nconvening in 1997 of an international conference to\r\nevaluate the results of the Vienna Convention and to\r\nmake the necessary adjustments to it.\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nThere is still time for the international community to\r\nface up to its responsibility to bring about the final defeat\r\nof this international scourge.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Turkmenistan, His Excellency Mr. Boris\r\nShikhmuradov.\r\nMr. Shikhmuradov (Turkmenistan) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Please allow me to offer sincere\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like to emphasize that this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, will occupy a special place in the\r\nhistory of the Organization. In that context, on behalf of\r\nTurkmenistan and President Niyazov, I wish to express our\r\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts to build a new kind of\r\ninternational relations for the Organization.\r\nThe opportunity for our State to participate in the\r\naffairs of the world community as an independent entity\r\nflowed, of course, from those events that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in his report on the work of the Organization,\r\ndescribes as\r\n“the momentum in world affairs that appeared so\r\ndramatically at the outset of this decade.” (A/50/1,\r\npara. 4)\r\nSerenely, and immensely grateful for its good fortune,\r\nTurkmenistan embarked on its independent course and,\r\nwithout any political romanticism, began to carry out its\r\nprogramme of building a nation-State and a system of\r\nforeign ties and seeking optimal ways for participating in\r\ninternational relations. This was a quest for Turkmenistan’s\r\nplace in the United Nations system and a model of\r\nstatehood reflecting its national mentality and the traditions\r\nof the Turkmen people.\r\nSince that time, in our four years of independent\r\nexistence, we have travelled a great distance, and each step\r\nwe have taken along the way has been both in the national\r\ninterest of Turkmenistan and in the interest of stabilizing\r\nthe region and strengthening international security, in the\r\nconstant conviction that these two are inseparable.\r\nAfter engaging in broad contacts within the system of\r\nAsian States, we have once again become convinced of the\r\ncorrectness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning of\r\nthis century that Asia, with its enormous human, natural\r\nand intellectual resources, had every possibility of\r\nbecoming the most prosperous region in the world.\r\nHowever, throughout the entire history of the Asian\r\ncontinent, instability and protracted regional conflicts have\r\noften, unfortunately, constituted the political background,\r\nand this has significantly complicated the solution of\r\nproblems of internal development.\r\nTurkmenistan has set as its main priority the\r\npreservation of internal stability and social peace in\r\ncarrying out radical reforms in building its State and its\r\neconomy. This is vitally necessary in order for us to take\r\nadvantage of our enormous resource potential. But that\r\nimportant condition is not the only one: the other is\r\nstability around us so that we can freely and naturally\r\ndevelop our trade and economic relations with other\r\nStates. This question is of special interest, in view of the\r\nworld’s share of hydrocarbon deposits and other mineral\r\nand biological resources that Turkmenistan possesses.\r\nTurkmenistan is at one of the world’s important\r\ncrossroads of political and economic interests, in a\r\nregional dimension and beyond. Aware of this geopolitical\r\nreality, Turkmenistan is prepared to participate in the\r\nmost constructive way in establishing new relations in the\r\nregion and to promote efforts to establish there overall\r\nstability, security and effective and mutually advantageous\r\ncooperation on the basis of the principles of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe believe that with the breakup of the Soviet\r\nUnion and the Iron Curtain’s disappearance from its\r\nborders with its southern neighbours, a new region has\r\nemerged, a new community of States of Central Asia, the\r\nMiddle East, South-West Asia, the Caucasus and part of\r\nthe Near East. This region is united by common\r\ndevelopment interests, the restoration of historical trade\r\nand economic relations and cultural and humanitarian\r\ntraditions.\r\nThis was the logic that led to the idea of active\r\nparticipation in the Economic Cooperation Organization\r\n(ECO). I would like to emphasize that the ECO’s\r\nconfiguration fully corresponds to our concept of a new\r\nregion’s emergence following the disintegration of the\r\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics: the restoration of a\r\nnatural gravitational attraction between these States that\r\nfor decades were artificially divided by an ideological\r\nbarrier, which conditions for them the priority of\r\ntransportation, telecommunications and energy\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nprogrammes. Underlying these processes lies the principle\r\nof absolute economic feasibility, based on the mutual\r\ninterests of the member States of the ECO and the absence\r\nof any political, territorial or other disputes between them.\r\nAs for the internal tensions that persist in some\r\ncountries, we should stress that economic cooperation,\r\nparticipation and joint projects will create fertile soil for\r\nconstructive solutions to these problems. Turkmenistan\r\nbelieves that this 10-country organization, emerging at such\r\nan important time, will open up additional possibilities for\r\nthe newly independent States to the south of the former\r\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics.\r\nFurthermore, the basis of our political and economic\r\nstrategy is the principle of reasonable pragmatism and the\r\npreservation of positive experiences and ties from the past.\r\nWe have a politically new type of State. Its independent\r\nstatus cannot be achieved by denying the realities of the\r\npast and old ties that can still serve our higher interests\r\ntoday. In this respect, our relations with Russia and other\r\npartners in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\r\nhave remained a key component of Turkmenistan’s foreign\r\npolicy.\r\nI would like to lay special emphasis on the fact that\r\nthe obligations that neutral Turkmenistan has assumed have\r\nbeen set out in our Constitution and have been supported by\r\nthe people. These obligations not only take account of\r\nnational interests but also objectively promote the\r\ndevelopment of cooperation in the region, and they have\r\nenormous potential for stimulating the peacemaking\r\nprocesses in the area and for promoting the efforts of the\r\nworld community, primarily here at the United Nations, to\r\nrid it of obsolete measures and adopt preventive measures\r\nto defuse disputes and conflicts.\r\nI would like to set out some parameters of\r\nTurkmenistan’s neutrality initiative in order to make sure\r\nthat it is correctly understood by our partners in the United\r\nNations and supported by them as well.\r\nThe rapid pace of recent events determined the\r\nchanges in Asia’s geopolitical and geo-economic situation.\r\nThe nature and direction of inter-State and regional\r\nprocesses, an important component of some of these\r\nchanges, has resulted in the formation of new, independent\r\nStates, each having chosen its own independent path of\r\ndevelopment and having its own interests. One of the ways\r\nin which the uniqueness of each country has been\r\nmanifested is in its political path, as is natural. For each\r\ncountry that path is based on the people’s historical roots,\r\nmentality and psychological make-up. Turkmenistan is no\r\nexception to this. Merging the prospects for its own\r\ndevelopment with the direction and nature of regional and\r\ncontinental processes and linking national interests with\r\nthe objective requirements of the day — from this\r\ntheoretical and practical basis we have arrived at the need\r\nto proclaim neutrality as a principle and instrument of\r\nTurkmenistan’s foreign policy. We are pleased that our\r\nneutrality initiative is finding more and more support,\r\nattracting civil and political interest and receiving broad\r\ninternational recognition. We are grateful to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for providing\r\nTurkmenistan with assistance in this regard.\r\nIn the context of asserting itself as a neutral State,\r\nTurkmenistan requested admission to the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement as a full-fledged member. We hope that during\r\nthe non-aligned summit in Cartagena, Colombia,\r\nTurkmenistan’s membership will be confirmed. In this\r\ncontext, I would like to state Turkmenistan’s conviction\r\nthat the idea of non-alignment is both a vital and a viable\r\none. We do not share the view that it is archaic. We\r\nbelieve that we must not participate in the two conflicting\r\nglobal systems and that we need to turn to an idea of\r\nnon-participation in the various rigid regional blocs,\r\nmulti-State formations capable of generating considerable\r\ndestructive force. Turkmenistan advocates non-alignment,\r\nas well as non-participation in improper acts of\r\nintervention in the internal affairs of States, non-\r\nparticipation in efforts for global or regional dominance\r\nand non-participation in schemes to limit the role of the\r\nUnited Nations or weaken the universal and proven\r\nmachinery for implementing global policy. Such practices\r\nserve selfish purposes.\r\nWe are convinced that the use of military force to\r\nsolve existing conflicts has no future, but that negotiations\r\nare effective. Although seeking peaceful means is\r\ncomplex, alternatives do not exist. At the same time, we\r\nunderstand that without active efforts, without good will,\r\nit will hardly be possible to attain the desired result.\r\nTherefore, inter alia, while not intervening in the Tajik\r\nconflict, we are prepared to play a role in holding the\r\nnext round of inter-Tajik negotiations. We welcome and\r\ncommend the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations\r\nand Russia, Iran, Pakistan and other countries in this\r\nprocess.\r\nNaturally, we must be concerned at the situation\r\nunfolding in neighbouring Afghanistan. Supporting\r\ncontacts with the central Government in Kabul, as well as\r\nwith regional leaders, we believe that the Afghans must\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nbe helped to demonstrate their ability to achieve peace and\r\nconsensus in their country, and that attempts to intervene in\r\nAfghanistan’s internal affairs not only are counter-\r\nproductive, but may lead to highly undesirable\r\nconsequences. In that context, I would like to emphasize\r\nthat Turkmenistan gives priority to the United Nations, to\r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to find an acceptable\r\nmachinery for an Afghan settlement. Turkmenistan agrees\r\nwith the concern expressed from this rostrum at the\r\ncontinuing internal Afghan conflict. Turkmenistan has a\r\nlong border with this long-suffering State and is truly\r\ninterested in finding a prompt settlement to the Afghan\r\nproblem. We are also interested in the success of the\r\nspecial representative of the United Nations, who in our\r\nview requires serious support from the United Nations. We\r\ncannot allow a situation whereby efforts to focus on solving\r\none conflict cause less attention to be paid to another,\r\nresulting in negative consequences.\r\nJust as mankind has become aware that the nuclear\r\nthreat has a global dimension, we are also aware that today\r\nwe need an adequate response to all regional and local\r\ndisputes and conflicts. I would like to emphasize that\r\nAshkhabad is prepared to engage in constructive\r\ncooperation with the United Nations on these issues, and to\r\ndemonstrate its commitment to the principles of\r\nconstructive neutrality.\r\nAll countries and peoples are now adapting in their\r\nown ways to new conditions in the world, which dictate the\r\nneed to adopt a common philosophy of security, based on\r\nthe principle of security for one and security for all. I\r\nwould like to emphasize that at this stage we are talking\r\nabout a philosophy, of perceptions of the world, reflecting\r\nrealities in Asian countries, in particular. This philosophy\r\nexcludes the use of force, diktat, as a means of solving\r\npolitical disputes, and its main principles should include\r\nequality, humanism, social and economic progress, and\r\nhealthy pragmatism.\r\nHere I should like to support what was said by my\r\ncolleague from Germany, Mr. Klaus Kinkel, who\r\nemphasized that we must not allow hostile stereotypes to\r\nbecome instilled in people’s minds and that we cannot\r\nassociate in one sweep Islam with terrorism and\r\nfundamentalism. We welcome this assertion and express our\r\nconviction that this attitude will become universal.\r\nAs for Turkmenistan, we are fundamental advocates of\r\na secular State model, in which religion would play its\r\nproper role. We believe that, as has been emphasized by\r\nPresident Niyasov, a poly-ethnic, multi-faith State model\r\nand structure is more effective, more fruitful, than a\r\nmono-ethnic and mono-religious State.\r\nI take this opportunity to emphasize the support that\r\nTurkmenistan has received, through its participation in the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), in European matters, as one of the legal\r\nsuccessors of the former federated State. This has created\r\nfor us, in a difficult transitional time of colossal\r\ntransformations, the possibility of benefiting from Asian-\r\nEuropean development. In that context, the words of the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Hervé de\r\nCharette, were very important for us, when he spoke\r\nabout the States of Asia and Africa and about focusing on\r\nthe first meeting of Heads of State of Asia and Africa, set\r\nfor March 1996. We hope, within the context of\r\nactivating work on the Euro-Asian bridge, that there will\r\nbe other major projects, with the participation of\r\nTurkmenistan, on a direct window to Europe. Primarily,\r\nwe are talking about a north-south transit corridor to link\r\nEurope and Asia, through the territory of Russia and\r\nTurkmenistan, facilitating the supply of Turkmen energy\r\nto European markets and so on.\r\nI should like to emphasize that we have witnessed a\r\nsignificant, if not radical, increase in international interest\r\nin Caspian Sea matters, and the utilization of its abundant\r\nnatural resources. Our conceptual approach to this is\r\nbased on the idea that the Caspian Sea is a unique water\r\nbasin and the common property of the five coastal States.\r\nIn the making of plans for the development of its\r\nresources account should be taken of those States’\r\ninterests; their consent should be required and no\r\nunilateral decisions should be taken. Turkmenistan firmly\r\nadvocates the prevention of any naval activities in the\r\nCaspian Sea, and favours freedom of navigation, on the\r\nbasis of a legal status to be developed by the littoral\r\nStates. We must create legal and economic conditions that\r\nwill guarantee a normal regime for foreign investment and\r\nexclude any risks for investors, such as the emergence of\r\na situation of distrust between the States of the basin.\r\nAt the coming anniversary session of the General\r\nAssembly next month, President Niyasov will set forth\r\nthe principles of the domestic and foreign policies of\r\nTurkmenistan, focusing on problems being taken up by\r\nthe United Nations, an Organization reflecting the face of\r\nmankind, which today faces a new millennium with its\r\nunique challenges and times and circumstances. We\r\nsincerely congratulate each other, and first and foremost\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, as we are absolutely\r\nconvinced that the United Nations, in this year of its\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nfiftieth anniversary, will prove that it is essential to the\r\nworld as the highest international assembly, developing an\r\nagenda for global partnership in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I shall\r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first, and\r\nfive minutes for the second, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Yañez-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Spanish delegation feels duty-bound to\r\nexercise its right of reply.\r\nMy delegation would like to refer to the mentions of\r\nthe Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla contained in the\r\nstatement made here today by the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco. Such references are not in keeping\r\nwith reality, since those are Spanish territories, whose\r\ncitizens are represented in the Spanish Parliament with the\r\nsame rights and under the same conditions as their\r\ncompatriots, and it is not possible to establish any parallels\r\nwith other situations which are quite different in nature.\r\nSuch references are not appropriate, since they are not\r\nin keeping with the overall relationship which exists\r\nbetween the Kingdoms of Spain and of Morocco, bilaterally\r\nas well as in the region as a whole, to which we both, as\r\nneighbours, belong.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): I am speaking in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply because the Foreign Minister of India\r\nmade a reference in his statement this morning to Jammu\r\nand Kashmir as a State in India. Jammu and Kashmir is a\r\ndisputed territory and Pakistan is a party to this dispute. To\r\ndescribe the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir as a\r\nState in India is totally fallacious and a distortion of the\r\nfacts as they are known to the United Nations. The relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions clearly determine that the final\r\ndisposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir will be\r\nmade in accordance with the will of the people, expressed\r\nthrough the democratic method of a free and impartial\r\nplebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. The Indian claim that Kashmir is an integral part\r\nof India is therefore untenable and incorrect.\r\nOnly a week ago, the spokesperson of the Indian\r\nExternal Affairs Ministry, while commenting on the United\r\nNations Secretary-General’s offer of mediation on\r\nKashmir, said that India remained fully committed to the\r\nresolution of the Kashmir issue peacefully, in accordance\r\nwith the Simla Agreement. If Jammu and Kashmir was a\r\npart of the Indian Union, why would India appeal to the\r\nGovernment of Pakistan “to demonstrate sincerity in\r\nfinding a peaceful solution to the Jammu and Kashmir\r\nproblem”? Why would the Secretary-General want to\r\noffer his good offices on an Indian province? Or why\r\nwould it be raised in international forums? The fact of the\r\nmatter is that Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally\r\nrecognized disputed territory.\r\nThe Indian Foreign Minister also described terrorism\r\nas the “black plague” of our times, and we fully agree.\r\nBut he went on to say that it is specious logic to say that\r\none man’s freedom-fighter is another man’s terrorist. The\r\nfact is that the United Nations has consistently underlined\r\nthe distinction between terrorism, on the one hand, and\r\nthe legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or alien\r\ndomination or foreign occupation for the realization of\r\ntheir right to self-determination and national liberation, on\r\nthe other hand. The latter is exactly the situation in\r\nJammu and Kashmir, where for the past 47 years an\r\noppressed population has been struggling to seek\r\nliberation from the Indian yoke. Its struggle is not a\r\nmovement for secession; it is not a violation of the\r\nterritorial integrity of a country: it is the realization of a\r\npromise that was made to the people of Jammu and\r\nKashmir by the United Nations and agreed to by India\r\nand Pakistan. No amount of distortion of history or\r\nattempts to cloud the issue by sidetracking it can change\r\nthe irrefutable validity of Security Council resolutions\r\nfreely accepted but subsequently reneged on by India.\r\nTerrorism, in any case, should be condemned and\r\nopposed in all its forms and manifestations, including\r\nState-sponsored terrorism targeting people living under\r\nalien domination and foreign occupation. The United\r\nNations should not appease the States that are involved in\r\norganized terrorism against the people of occupied\r\nterritories. With 600,000 armed troops in Jammu and\r\nKashmir terrorizing an innocent people, we are witnessing\r\nState-sponsored terrorism at its worst.\r\nReference was also made by the Foreign Minister of\r\nIndia to the unfortunate incident of hostage-taking in\r\nKashmir. We have already had occasion to point out in\r\nthis forum the mounting evidence of Indian complicity in\r\nthis gruesome act. This time again, as in past instances,\r\nforeign tourists have been taken hostage by a group\r\nunknown to all, including to the 34-member All-Parties\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nHurriyet Conference. Al-Faran, a group which manages to\r\noperate with immunity in one of the most heavily soldiered\r\nregions of the world, a group which manages to stay in\r\nregular communication and contact with the Indian\r\nauthorities, without their being able to trace it — all this is\r\nonly part of the circumstantial evidence of a plot\r\nmasterminded by Indian intelligence agencies to denigrate\r\nthe Kashmiri struggle for freedom. No one here is gullible\r\nenough to accept Indian professions of piety.\r\nFinally, the Indian Foreign Minister said that\r\ndemocracy alone is not a guarantee against colonial rule or\r\nwars. We agree. In fact, here is the so-called largest\r\ndemocracy in the world responsible for the largest operation\r\nof State-sponsored terrorism and the most gruesome human\r\nrights violations seen over the past 50 years.\r\nMr. Gaussot (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nSome opinions expressed today on nuclear tests, in the\r\nframework of the general debate, make it necessary for my\r\ndelegation to set forth certain facts once again.\r\nFirst of all, our underground nuclear tests are in no\r\nway detrimental to the environment; eminent scientists have\r\ndemonstrated this on many occasions.\r\nSecondly, the final tests, eight at the most, that France\r\nfinds it necessary to carry out are not contrary to its\r\ncommitment to exercise the utmost restraint. Restraint is not\r\nthe same thing as prohibition. Furthermore — and this point\r\nis fundamental — far from being contrary to the conclusion\r\nof a comprehensive test-ban treaty, the last programme of\r\ntests now under way serves the achievement of that goal.\r\nIndeed, because of this final programme of tests, to be\r\nconcluded before the end of May 1996, France will be in\r\na position to commit itself to such an international\r\nagreement without any reservations.\r\nFurthermore, the completion of our tests will make it\r\npossible for my country to argue resolutely for what is\r\nknown as the zero-option — that is, for a treaty prohibiting\r\nany nuclear-weapons testing or any other nuclear explosion,\r\nat any level. France, as the Assembly knows, was the first\r\nnuclear Power to commit itself to this essential option, and\r\nmy delegation is pleased to see that several States have\r\nwelcomed that commitment.\r\nThe most recent French tests thus come within the\r\ncontext of, and must be seen from the point of view of, the\r\nimpending conclusion of a truly significant treaty, namely\r\na treaty that does not envisage any exception or allow for\r\nany circumvention.\r\nMs. Murugesan (India): The representative of\r\nPakistan does not tire of wasting the valuable time of this\r\nAssembly. The unfounded and baseless allegations he has\r\njust made are only a reflection of the frustration that is\r\naxiomatic when truth is pushed under the carpet and an\r\nattempt is made to build an edifice on falsehood. Or is\r\nthis latest outburst reflective of a guilty conscience? It is\r\nno doubt a mixture of the two.\r\nI am intrigued that the representative of Pakistan has\r\nchosen to exercise his right of reply in response to the\r\nstatement made earlier today in the Assembly by the\r\nleader of my delegation. I do not recall, nor I am sure can\r\nanyone else in this Assembly recall, any reference to\r\nPakistan in our statement today. We can therefore draw\r\nthe only possible logical conclusion: that Pakistan is\r\nactively engaged in interfering in the internal affairs of\r\nIndia.\r\nBlaming India is so juvenile a reaction to Pakistan’s\r\nown culpability in sponsoring, supporting and sustaining\r\nterrorism in its most brutal form in India that it deserves\r\nno response. Such an allegation from a State that has\r\nturned its armed might against its own people is ironic, to\r\nsay the least.\r\nThe only impediment to dialogue between India and\r\nPakistan is Pakistan’s continued export of terrorism in its\r\nmost brutal form into India. Pakistan’s greed for Indian\r\nterritory has fuelled three wars which, by the\r\nacknowledgement of Pakistan’s own generals, were\r\nstarted by Pakistan; and since 1989, that greed has fuelled\r\nPakistan’s proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir through\r\nterrorism. This is the distinction in Jammu and Kashmir\r\nbetween terrorism and self-determination. Self-\r\ndetermination here is predetermination by Pakistan.\r\nPakistan should be condemned by the international\r\ncommunity as a sponsor of terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations — cross-border, State-sponsored terrorism\r\nin India and Afghanistan, ongoing State terrorism against\r\nethnic minorities in Sind, clear linkages to international\r\nterrorism such as the World Trade Center bombing, and\r\nseveral other incidents in the Middle East. The terrorist\r\ncamps and schools run by Pakistan should be shut down.\r\nOur official spokesman stated on 21 September that\r\nin spite of the numerous provocations by Pakistan, the\r\nIndian security forces have exercised enormous restraint.\r\nThere is no threat to peace and security in the region\r\nfrom the Indian side of the Line of Control or the\r\ninternational border. The Government of India hopes that\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 29 September 1995\r\nthe Government of Pakistan would demonstrate sincerity in\r\nfinding a peaceful solution by eschewing sponsorship of\r\nterrorism across the Line of Control and returning to the\r\nnegotiating table for a meaningful dialogue.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): Once again we have heard one\r\nof India’s representatives trying to hide their own guilt\r\nbehind non-relevant arguments. We dismiss their allegations\r\nwith the contempt that they deserve. The central and only\r\npoint that has to be addressed is that of the disputed\r\nterritory of Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nCan the Indian representative deny that the United\r\nNations, of which this Assembly is a constituent part, duly\r\nrecognizes Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory? Can\r\nshe deny that the Security Council resolutions clearly state\r\nthat the future of Jammu and Kashmir is to be determined\r\nby a plebiscite, to be held under the auspices of the United\r\nNations? Can she deny that the Security Council resolutions\r\nremain valid and operative until they are fully\r\nimplemented? Can she deny that the concentration of Indian\r\ntroops in Kashmir is the largest such concentration since\r\nthe Second World War, with a ratio of one Indian soldier\r\nto every three adult male Kashmiris? Can she deny the\r\nsystematic killing, torture and rape of civilians by Indian\r\ntroops or the torching of their homes, villages and\r\ntownships, as documented by so many human rights\r\norganizations? Can she deny the excellent means of\r\ncommunication that exist between Indian security and\r\nintelligence forces and the Al-Faran outfit, which has\r\ntaken innocent Western tourists hostage and beheaded one\r\nof them?\r\nCan she deny that it is India that has opposed the\r\nproposal by Pakistan for an increased strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations Military Observer Group in India and\r\nPakistan (UNMOGIP) along the Line of Control, so that\r\nthese facile allegations of theirs can be monitored by the\r\nUnited Nations itself? Can she deny, finally, that despite\r\nrepeated proposals by Pakistan, it is India that has\r\nrejected the offer for an independent, neutral international\r\nfact-finding mission to visit both sides of the Line of\r\nControl, to establish once and for all what is the true state\r\nof affairs in this disputed territory of Jammu and\r\nKashmir?\r\nThese are the relevant questions, to which we, and\r\nthis Assembly, want clear answers from the Indian\r\ndelegation. They are entitled to a reply to a statement in\r\nright of reply. We challenge them to come on record to\r\nanswer these questions in front of the Assembly.\r\nMr. Surie (India): I have no intention of further\r\ndignifying the representative of Pakistan by wasting the\r\ntime of this Assembly. However, I would only urge\r\nPakistan to look deep within itself and cleanse itself of\r\nthe devil that lurks within.\r\nJammu and Kashmir is, and shall remain, an integral\r\npart of India. This is an immutable fact.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.35 p.m.\r\n39\r\n"
