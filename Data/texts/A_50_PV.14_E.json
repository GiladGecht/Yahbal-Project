(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Reyn (Belgium),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Janez Drnovšek, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Slovenia\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Assembly will first hear a statement by the Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Janez Drnovšek, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Slovenia, His Excellency Mr. Janez\r\nDrnovšek, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Drnovšek (Slovenia): It is a great pleasure to see\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral presiding over the important\r\nproceedings of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are confident that under his guidance this session will\r\nbe a great success.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations gives\r\nus a reason and an opportunity to reflect on the state of\r\nthe United Nations and on the question of its ability to\r\nadjust to a changing world. This is especially necessary\r\nin our times. We have witnessed in the short span of the\r\nlast few years a variety of changes which have affirmed\r\nthe global nature of all the basic issues facing mankind.\r\nAn array of United Nations conferences and summits\r\nhas strengthened our common awareness of the global\r\nnature of environmental and development issues,\r\nincluding those related to social development. The world-\r\nwide tendency towards democracy and the freedom of the\r\nindividual has strengthened the world-wide cause of\r\nhuman rights. The notion of our common security is\r\nbeing redefined and globalized. It now contains not only\r\nmilitary and political, but also economic, social and\r\nenvironmental components.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly began less\r\nthan two weeks after the conclusion of the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women. That conference amply\r\ndemonstrated the depth and the global nature of the\r\nchanges that are at hand. The equality of women and the\r\nrealization of the human rights of women are now among\r\nthe priority issues on the international agenda.\r\nThe United Nations has highlighted the sensitivity of\r\nthe organized international community to the crucial\r\nissues facing the world and the Organization’s ability to\r\nprovide a framework for articulating the main objectives\r\nand commitments. It has also demonstrated the ability to\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nformulate principal policy objectives. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, the United Nations has yet to prove its ability to\r\norganize effective international cooperation for the\r\nrealization of voluntary, agreed objectives and\r\ncommitments. This is a more difficult task, and much is left\r\nto be desired in our fulfilment of it.\r\nFurthermore, it is in this context that the question of\r\nreform of the United Nations system arises. Reforms are\r\nneeded to respond to profound changes in international\r\nrelations and should be much more far-reaching and\r\ncarefully focused than is currently the case. So, for\r\nexample, reforms in the economic and social domains\r\nshould duly take into account the transformation of the\r\nworld economy and the ever growing importance of market\r\nforces, private-initiative entrepreneurship and free trade. In\r\nthese circumstances there is no place for the creation of\r\nunnecessary supra-State structures. What is needed,\r\nhowever, is carefully targeted operational cooperation for\r\ndevelopment and high-level dialogue capable of assisting\r\nMember States to formulate the most effective economic\r\nand social policies.\r\nThe functional commissions of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council should become places where decision\r\nmakers both from Governments and from non-governmental\r\nsectors meet and devise specific strategies. New schemes of\r\ncooperation among governmental and non-governmental\r\nsectors are needed, not least to develop appropriate models\r\nfor financing the relevant priorities in the fields of\r\nenvironment and social development.\r\nCareful thinking and responsible action are necessary\r\nfor the strengthening of international peace and security.\r\nEach of the diverse priorities in this domain will require\r\nserious efforts if satisfactory solutions are to be possible.\r\nHowever, there are also fears that the will to reach them\r\nhas not yet been mobilized.\r\nAnother priority area of United Nations action for the\r\nstrengthening of international peace and security concerns\r\nthe necessary reform of the principal United Nations body\r\nin this field, the Security Council. An awareness of the\r\nneed to strengthen the representative character and the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council through expansion of\r\nits membership is now generally shared. Slovenia is among\r\nthose Members of the United Nations which support the\r\nidea of appropriate expansion of the number of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent seats on the Security\r\nCouncil. This is the majority view now. Furthermore, we\r\nbelieve that in order to reflect adequately the political and\r\neconomic realities of our time it is important that Germany\r\nand Japan should become permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn the framework of the proposed reform, we should\r\nask ourselves what the future role of the United Nations\r\nought to be. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, after the\r\ndisappearance of the communist bloc, there is a new\r\nsituation in the world. The process is basically positive,\r\nbut in the first years after the big change there are still\r\nmany questions to be answered. The world must find new\r\nstability, a new balance. The danger of regional conflicts\r\nand wars has increased. The international community did\r\nnot find adequate responses to specific situations, such as\r\nthose in Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nBut we cannot simply say that international\r\ninstitutions, including the United Nations, were inefficient\r\nin dealing with these situations. The humanitarian\r\nendeavour and contribution were significant. Many\r\nremarkable efforts were put into solutions — efforts by\r\nindividuals and by institutions. But it remains clear that\r\nthe world must find answers to the new challenges.\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a very\r\ngood example. It is an important case in itself, but it is\r\nalso a very important precedent to be considered in the\r\nfuture. The response of the world to the situation in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia was slow. Preventive diplomacy failed\r\nin this case, as in many other crises, as a result of the\r\nnormal behaviour of the majority of politicians, who\r\nusually give priority to domestic situations and problems.\r\nBut in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina there is\r\nanother very important dimension of the problem: a\r\nsolution or the absence of a solution will influence the\r\nfuture.\r\nHow will the post-cold-war world develop? Will\r\nthere be efficient international coordination, mainly within\r\nthe United Nations, to take care of such problems and\r\ncrises? Or shall we go back to the old division of the\r\nworld and of Europe: the division, in interest spheres,\r\namong classic Powers — the traditional interest spheres\r\nof the most important countries?\r\nIt is obvious that in the case of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina there was some mix of the two approaches.\r\nThere was an international effort in the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations, and there were differences among some\r\npower States with different opinions about the situation.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is where the First World War\r\nstarted, when the old European Powers tried to expand\r\ntheir interest zones. The former Yugoslavia was at the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\ncrossroads of many interests and is where so many horrors\r\nand killings took place during the Second World War. And\r\nthere are some signs that the international community has\r\nnot yet completely overcome such historical divisions and\r\ninfluences.\r\nOn the other hand, we cannot say that this historical\r\napproach prevailed in tackling the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. There was also strong international action in\r\nthe name of the universal order and universal values, in the\r\nname of the protection of human rights, in the name of the\r\nprotection of the rights of all nations. It is very encouraging\r\nthat we recently witnessed really serious activity, a very\r\nserious peace plan. Diplomatic activity combined with the\r\nnecessary military action has for the first time provided a\r\nrealistic chance to stop the war and the killing in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and to establish a durable peace and the\r\nprospect of stability in the region.\r\nIf these activities succeed, they will be an extremely\r\nimportant model for the future, for further development of\r\ninternational coordination in the framework of the United\r\nNations. If the international community is able to solve\r\nsuch an extremely difficult case as that of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina we shall all be encouraged to direct new\r\nenergy and efforts towards establishing global instruments\r\nand activities to prevent and to solve future crises. The\r\ninternational community will strengthen its institutions in\r\nsupport of universal values and rights.\r\nIf it fails in this case the situation will be just the\r\nopposite. The road will be open to anarchy, chaos and\r\nregional wars, to the rule of the stronger, to the old\r\npractices of spheres of interest, and the world will not find\r\na way out of the post-cold-war situation. Instability will\r\nincrease, and the chances of regional and global wars will\r\nbe greater.\r\nSo we are at a very important moment in history and\r\nin the functioning of the United Nations. If the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations is celebrated with success\r\nin finally solving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, this\r\nwill be the best reward for everybody who, over the past 50\r\nyears, has sacrificed his time, his energy or even his life for\r\nthe establishment of a world of freedom, stability and\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nOf course, there are many problems to be solved in\r\nthe future. The United Nations will have to develop\r\nefficient instruments of preventive diplomacy and means of\r\nhandling crises if they occur anyway and of defining the\r\ncriteria as to when and how to intervene. As is very evident\r\nfrom the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is not always\r\neasy to achieve a unanimous definition of “the bad guys”\r\nin the world order or to agree upon action against them.\r\nBut there are human rights criteria, and there are\r\nuniversal values that were developed in the world over\r\nthe centuries, and especially during recent decades. These\r\nhave to be respected and implemented.\r\nLuckily, Slovenia was out of the Yugoslav crisis at\r\na very early stage and established its independence four\r\nyears ago. Now we have a very prosperous State with\r\ngood democratic performance and very good economic\r\ndevelopment. Slovenia is considered one of the best\r\ncountries, if not the best country, in transition to the\r\nmarket and democratic system. We are also prepared to\r\nmake our contribution to building the international\r\ninstitutions and the coordination that will lead to greater\r\nstability in the world. We see our future as being in\r\ninternational institutions like the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and the European Union. We look\r\nupon such bodies not only as economic or defence\r\ninstitutions but also as institutions that should ensure\r\ngreater stability in the world, greater democracy and the\r\ndevelopment of universal principles of individual and\r\ncollective human rights.\r\nBut we can see that the way is not easy. Even in our\r\nown neighbourhood we face some remnants of the past.\r\nThis is just one further reason for our insistence on\r\nrespect by everybody, and not just by the smaller and the\r\nweaker countries, for principle in international relations,\r\ndemocracy and universal values. This is the only\r\nguarantee of international peace and stability. Clearly, if\r\nwe start to correct the past and the present on the basis of\r\nsome historical tendencies of domination, there will be no\r\nway of securing the future stability of the world. The\r\nsolution lies only in overcoming such practices and\r\nattitudes and in establishing international cooperation,\r\npeace and stability on the basis of respect for each other\r\nand for universal human rights.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia for the\r\nimportant statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Janez Drnovsek, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel,\r\nMr. Shimon Peres, upon whom I call.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nMr. Peres (Israel): I should like to congratulate Mr.\r\nFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are glad that a representative of\r\nPortugal, a nation for which Israel has high regard, was\r\nelected to that distinguished post.\r\nI would like to express to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, a man of our region and a man of\r\npeace, our deepest appreciation for his contribution to world\r\npeace in general and to the Middle East peace in particular.\r\nTomorrow, the Jewish people will pray on the day of\r\nYom Ha-Kippurim:\r\n(spoke in Hebrew; English text furnished by the delegation)\r\n“In the Book of Life: blessings, peace, a good\r\nlivelihood, good decrees, salvation and consolation.\r\nMay you be remembered and inscribed.”\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe pray for all humanity, for the whole world.\r\nFor us, the United Nations is not just a place of prayer\r\nand surely not a platform for speeches. We come here to\r\nstate our convictions and to announce our commitments. In\r\nour address in 1987, I stated on behalf of the State of\r\nIsrael:\r\n“We have found President Mubarak of Egypt to\r\nbe a builder of a better life for his people and of\r\nbridges for a comprehensive peace in the region.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\r\nsecond Session, Plenary Meetings, 17th meeting,\r\np. 23-25)\r\nToday, under the leadership of President Mubarak,\r\nEgypt is becoming a centre for regional development on the\r\nway to hosting the first regional bank of development.\r\nIn the same address, we stated:\r\n“An international conference is the door to direct\r\nnegotiations. Once convened it should lead\r\nimmediately to face-to-face bilateral negotiations.”\r\n(Ibid., p. 26)\r\nOn 30 October, 1991, the Madrid Conference took place.\r\nIn 1992, again we declared:\r\n“The opportunity to select, through democratic\r\npolitical elections, the Palestinian administrative\r\ncouncil will enable the Palestinian people to exercise\r\na double measure of freedom: the freedom to govern\r\ntheir own lives and to do so ... democratically.”\r\n(Ibid., Forty-seventh Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n20th meeting, p. 48)\r\nLast week, we achieved what we promised.\r\nLastly, in 1993, we declared again from this rostrum:\r\n“Geographically speaking, we live side by side\r\nwith the Jordanian Kingdom, and what is so obvious\r\ngeographically must become clear politically [so\r\nthat] we can offer the people of both sides of the\r\nriver full peace, that the Dead Sea can become a\r\nspring of new life.” (Ibid., Forty-eighth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 6th meeting, p. 22)\r\nIn October 1994, just one year later, Jordan and Israel\r\nsigned a peace treaty.\r\nLast year, we said here:\r\n“All countries of the Middle East face a choice:\r\nto remain politically divided and economically\r\nstagnant or to become economically advanced and\r\npolitically just.\r\n“... We shall try to establish instruments for\r\ndevelopment: a regional bank, channels for private\r\ninvestment and a framework for regional planning.”\r\n(Ibid., Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n10th meeting, p. 16)\r\nIn October 1994, the first Middle East-North African\r\neconomic summit was held in Casablanca under the\r\nsplendid presidency of His Majesty King Hassan II. At\r\nthe end of this month, a second summit will be held in\r\nAmman under the auspices of His Majesty King Hussein.\r\nAt the end of November, the first ground-breaking Euro-\r\nMediterranean conference will be held in Barcelona.\r\nThree years, five promises: all of them fulfilled. I\r\nwould like to use this occasion to turn to the Syrians and\r\nto turn to the Lebanese and ask them to stop hesitating,\r\nto stop wandering. They have to look at this record and\r\ncome in and follow up. The President of Syria has said\r\nthat from experience he has learned that only through\r\nmilitary negotiations and making security the major\r\nagenda item can one achieve peace. Sorry: Experience has\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nshown that through negotiation on all levels, embracing all\r\nissues without timidity, without fatigue, we can achieve\r\npeace. If leaders meet and are not successful at the first\r\nmeeting, they will have another meeting. How can it be\r\nwrong for them to work day and night, ceaselessly, with\r\nnew ideas and new approaches? They are not wasting the\r\nleaders’ time; they are wasting the time of the people —\r\ntheir fortunes, their happiness, opportunities for the younger\r\ngeneration.\r\nWe also tell all the countries of the Middle East, not\r\nthat we want to have a new Middle East, but that we want\r\nthe Middle East to join in a new age — for the good of\r\ntheir people, not for the good of Israel. Israel is in good\r\nshape because we are no longer living in a world where\r\nthere are empires of power and colonies of poverty. Poverty\r\nand oppression are home-made, not imposed by others. The\r\nchoice is before every country to become free and\r\nprosperous and democratic, like so many nations have done\r\nin a relatively short time in Asia, Latin America and in\r\nsome countries of Africa. It is their choice, their\r\nopportunity not just to build a different world but to\r\nintroduce the new world to their own people.\r\nFor us, the United States is not an empire of power.\r\nWe are not afraid of the United States. For us, the United\r\nStates is an empire of peace. We need the United States.\r\nFor us, Russia is going through a process of change. Russia\r\nwill remain great but will become something different. For\r\nus, we welcome the European contribution to other\r\ncountries east and south of them and the convening of the\r\nBarcelona conference to offer the Mediterranean peoples\r\nfunds and experience to build a new life. We are glad that\r\nJapan is expanding its economic horizons and understanding\r\nand contributing so that other nations can do so. And we\r\nhope that other well-to-do countries in the Middle East,\r\nincluding Arab countries, will help the needy parts of our\r\nown region.\r\nMay I say that in my best judgement the greatest\r\ndanger is a combination of high technology and deep\r\nhatred, of modern instruments and feudalistic views, and\r\nthe greatest hope for all of us is a double effort to respect\r\nhuman values and modern education.\r\nIsrael itself is in good shape. We are strong militarily:\r\nI do not deny it. We have an excellent economy — an\r\neconomy of brains, not of material resources. We have\r\nabsorbed a very large immigration of white and black Jews,\r\nwhite Jews from Russia and black Jews from Ethiopia, and\r\nnobody can understand what put Israel in such a relatively\r\ngood position.\r\nWhat brought this about is, first of all, the return to\r\nthe moral choice. By the end of this year — at the latest\r\nat the beginning of next year — not one Palestinian will\r\nremain under our control. For the first time in the history\r\nof the Palestinian people, they are educating their children\r\nwithout intervention by us or anybody else. Nobody\r\nforces us to do so. We are not weak. We are not poor.\r\nWe are not under pressure. We have had to take serious\r\nrisks because terror still continues. The Arab boycott is\r\nstill intact.\r\nIn our own country there is strong opposition to\r\nwhat we are doing. We have had to spend a great part of\r\nour budget to make peace — and yet, despite all this, we\r\ndecided to make a moral choice: not to dominate another\r\npeople. We stated in this Assembly that that was our\r\nintention. Now we have done it and even politically, as\r\ndifficult as it may be at home — because, as a party, we\r\nmay win historically but we may also lose politically —\r\nbut then, winning peace is in our eyes more important\r\nthan winning elections. Why should you be elected if you\r\ndo not use the mandate of the people to change the course\r\nof your history in a reasoned, moral way?\r\nWe believe that the strength of ethical judgement is\r\nas important as military exercises or triumphs. We gave\r\nup land and produced instead an economy of brains.\r\nToday Israel is making out of its brains more than some\r\nother countries in our vicinity are making out of oil.\r\nAnd what we actually expect from the Palestinians\r\nis for them to become democratic, to be prosperous, to\r\nfight violence and terror, and we are giving our\r\nneighbours a simple message: What we can do,\r\neverybody can do.\r\nFor many years there was a legend that only the\r\nNorth, which is white and wealthy and permanent, is a\r\nsuccess story, whereas the South is condemned to\r\nbackwardness, to poverty, to lagging behind. What has\r\nhappened in Asia, where the most vibrant economic\r\nendeavours are taking place today, and what is happening\r\nin Latin America show that the economy has nothing to\r\ndo with geographical location or the colour of the skin.\r\nMake the right choice: serve your people and create a\r\nnew future.\r\nWhat we are offering to anyone who is interested is\r\nour experience — open, in a comradely way. We do not\r\nwant to dominate anybody and certainly not anybody’s\r\neconomy. We did not give up the domination of people\r\nto gain domination of markets. And we are suggesting to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nour neighbours — and we are happy that they have\r\naccepted — is that the new frontiers — say, between\r\nJordan and Israel — will not be frontiers of mines and\r\nhostile fences, but an occasion for joint ventures.\r\nThe whole rift of Africa, the whole valley which is a\r\ndesert that separates the Jordanians and us will become,\r\nwith God’s help, a source for work, for development. We\r\nwill build hotels and schools and desalination plants and\r\nparks, and people will be free to move from one side to the\r\nother, competing without hating, cooperating without\r\ndominating.\r\nWe want to do the same about the dividing line\r\nbetween us and the Palestinians: we want to build alongside\r\nthe line on the West Bank and Gaza eight industrial parks\r\nso that the Palestinians will not have to cross the border\r\nand go through Israel’s checkpoints: instead, work will\r\ncome to them, and together we shall invest and together we\r\nshall develop.\r\nA better economy is the best guarantee of peace.\r\nActually, there cannot be economic cooperation without\r\npolitical understanding. Recently, while we were negotiating\r\nwe created three zones of security sensibility on the West\r\nBank — zone A, zone B and zone C. Then we turned to\r\nwater and electricity and we asked the water and the\r\ncurrent to submit to our political wisdom, but the electricity\r\nand the water people said that they did not distinguish\r\nbetween A, B and C. Water flows according to nature and\r\nnot according to artificial agreements, and electric current\r\ndoes not stop at A or B or C. They serve everybody.\r\nToday in the Middle East as elsewhere, the distinction\r\nis no longer ideological or religious or national. There is\r\njust one distinction between an old, poor, backward\r\neconomy and a new age where economies are based on\r\ntechnology and science and where the natural resource is\r\nschools for the children and not the mines of the Gulf.\r\nEverybody can postpone the choice but nobody can escape\r\nit.\r\nOur aim is to have peace so as to serve our people; to\r\nhave education so as to equip our children to take\r\nadvantage of the new age, to be equal to others and to\r\ncompete with other children. It cannot remain a peace\r\nbetween leaders: it must become a peace for the people,\r\nnow and in the future.\r\nI started by showing what has happened in three or\r\nfour short years. It is a revolution. It is a beginning. We\r\nshould not stop in the middle. Let everybody pray to the\r\nLord in the language he is used to. Let everybody respect\r\nhis own tradition, his own heritage. Let everybody respect\r\nthe special experience of a people, of a nation. But let all\r\nof us give up unnecessary hatred, untold suspicion. Let us\r\ngive up barricading ourselves behind old dogmas and\r\nterrible prejudices. Let us help the people and the future.\r\nThen the 50 years of the United Nations will offer not\r\njust 50 years without war but the coming 50 years with\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nIndonesia, His Excellency Mr. Ali Alatas.\r\nMr. Alatas (Indonesia): On behalf of the Indonesian\r\ndelegation I should like to offer our congratulations to\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election as\r\nPresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are confident that under his able guidance we will\r\nmake substantive progress in our work.\r\nTo his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, I should like to convey our deep\r\nappreciation for the exemplary manner in which he\r\npresided over the Assembly at the last session.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to our esteemed Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedicated\r\nendeavours in pursuing the objectives of the United\r\nNations Charter and for his untiring efforts for the cause\r\nof peace and development.\r\nWe observe the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations at a most crucial time in the history of\r\nhumankind. In this post-cold-war era, we have been\r\nconfronted by global changes so profound and massive\r\nthat we are just beginning to understand some of their\r\nramifications. These changes have generated challenges\r\nand contradictory trends in international relations which\r\nhave cast a dark shadow on our contemporary world and\r\nintensified our sense of uncertainty as we stand on the\r\nthreshold of a new century. On the other hand, a\r\ndeepening sense of interdependence has prompted nations\r\nto devise more equitable and mutually beneficial patterns\r\nof cooperation — and this has provided us with a new\r\nsource of hope. Fittingly indeed, on this fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, hope is the dominant\r\nfeeling in the world today just as it was hope, for a more\r\npeaceful and tolerant world, which inspired the founding\r\nof the United Nations in San Francisco half a century\r\nago.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nWith the Second World War barely over, the\r\ninternational community of that time sought to establish a\r\nworld organization which would “save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war” by instituting a\r\nsystem of collective security based on the repudiation of the\r\nuse of force “save in the common interest”, and on the\r\nbasic principles of sovereign equality, freedom, justice and\r\nthe rule of law. This splendid vision was not to be realized,\r\nfor soon the cold war set in between two rival military and\r\nideological blocs locked in a struggle for dominance. Power\r\npolitics and the quest for hegemony and spheres of\r\ninfluence paralysed the collective security system. That may\r\nbe why the United Nations has not been able to prevent the\r\nmore than 150 armed conflicts which, since its founding,\r\nhave erupted in various parts of the world, taking a horrible\r\ntoll in human lives and material devastation. And that also\r\npartly explains the persistence of inequities and imbalances\r\nin international economic relations.\r\nThe United Nations was but a decade old when the\r\nfirst generation of leaders of Asia and Africa, reacting to\r\nthe debilitating effects of the cold war and the problems\r\nbesetting the world at the time, met in Bandung to\r\narticulate a new ethos which would reaffirm the ideals and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter and\r\ngovern relationships between and among nations, great and\r\nsmall. Thus in 1955 the leaders of Asia and Africa laid\r\ndown the “Dasa Sila of Bandung” — the “Ten Principles\r\nof Bandung” — which embodied fundamental principles of\r\ninter-State relations in accordance with the spirit of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe seeds that germinated in Bandung took firm root\r\nsix years later in Belgrade with the formal institution of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement. Since then, the Movement has\r\nserved as a moral and political force that provided an\r\nalternative vision to the bloc politics of the cold war.\r\nPursuing that vision, the Movement contributed to the\r\ntriumph of such causes as the world-wide struggle against\r\ncolonialism; the drive against institutionalized racism,\r\nparticularly apartheid; the advocacy for nuclear\r\ndisarmament, which is finally under way; and, lately, the\r\nlaunching of a global partnership for development. It is no\r\ncoincidence that these are the very same issues as those on\r\nthe agenda of the United Nations, for it is precisely within\r\nthe United Nations and through its processes and\r\ninstitutions that the Non-Aligned Movement has waged its\r\nstruggles for, and pursued its advocacy of, the principles\r\nand ideas enshrined in the United Nations Charter and\r\nreiterated in the Dasa Sila of Bandung. There is no doubt\r\nthat the United Nations has served as the principal\r\ninstrument for the amelioration of the human condition\r\nthrough the pursuit of peace and development.\r\nIn spite of the constraints to its system of collective\r\nsecurity, the United Nations has nevertheless undertaken\r\na large number of peace-keeping and peacemaking\r\noperations. Admittedly, not all United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping efforts have been regarded as successful, but they\r\nhave consistently promoted progress in negotiations\r\nbetween the parties in conflict. In the process the United\r\nNations has expanded the meaning of peace-keeping\r\nbeyond mere impartial interposition to include the\r\nprotection of humanitarian aid, refugees and displaced\r\npersons as well as assistance to countries holding\r\nelections. Even the set-backs and difficulties encountered\r\nin peace-keeping operations have yielded useful insights\r\nthat could help secure the success of similar undertakings\r\nin the future.\r\nWith the implementation of “An Agenda for Peace”\r\nand its Supplement, further progress may be expected, not\r\nonly in peace-keeping but also in preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking, post-conflict peace-building and the\r\ncomplementary role of regional organizations in\r\nmaintaining peace and security.\r\nWe are heartened that the Agenda for Peace has\r\nbeen complemented with “An Agenda for Development”,\r\nwhich would not only enhance the capability of United\r\nNations to do its work in the economic and social spheres\r\nbut which will also facilitate the forging of a global\r\npartnership for development.\r\nHowever, the United Nations is much more than a\r\nforum for maintaining security, resolving conflicts and\r\nkeeping the peace. The Organization, its specialized\r\nagencies and related institutions have been engaged in an\r\nimmense array of activities that touch every aspect of\r\npeople’s lives all over the world.\r\nIt is therefore most regrettable to note that the\r\nseverest financial crisis in the history of the United\r\nNations casts a dark shadow over the fiftieth anniversary.\r\nIn particular, the failure of one major Member State to\r\nmeet its obligations by withholding legally obligated\r\ncontributions is not only contrary to Article 17 of the\r\nCharter but has also driven the Organization to the very\r\nbrink of insolvency. This aggravating situation has forced\r\nthe Secretary-General to try to resolve the crisis through\r\npostponing reimbursements to the troop-contributing\r\ncountries. This places an unfair burden on those countries\r\nand penalizes especially the developing countries among\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nthem. If the situation were to continue without urgent and\r\neffective measures being taken to resolve it, peace-keeping\r\noperations would grind to a halt and all our endeavours to\r\nmaintain peace and security would be endangered. The\r\nfiftieth anniversary presents us with an opportunity to\r\naddress this fundamental issue of the United Nations\r\ninsolvency at the highest political level, including possible\r\nrecourse to innovative global taxation schemes.\r\nThe achievements of the United Nations over the past\r\nfive decades make a compelling case for the further\r\nstrengthening of multilateral cooperation, and we believe\r\nthat the United Nations can be an even better instrument of\r\nmultilateral cooperation if we act with greater purpose and\r\ndetermination in rectifying its inadequacies and\r\nshortcomings through a comprehensive process of\r\nrestructuring, revitalization and democratization.\r\nMy delegation is therefore gratified that steps have\r\nbeen taken to revitalize the role of the General Assembly,\r\nincluding the reorganization of its Committee structures and\r\nthe streamlining of its agenda for greater efficiency and\r\nefficacy.\r\nIndonesia also believes that the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, including its permanent members, should\r\nbe increased so as to reflect the changed international\r\nsituation since 1945 and to accommodate the interests and\r\nconcerns of developing countries, which comprise the\r\noverwhelming majority of the Organization. It is a glaring\r\nanomaly that on the roster of permanent members of the\r\nCouncil Europe is overrepresented, Asia is underrepresented\r\nand Africa and Latin America are not represented at all. We\r\nare also of the view that additional permanent members\r\nshould be chosen on the basis, not only of equitable\r\ngeographical representation, but also of such objective\r\ncriteria as the political, economic and demographic weight\r\nof a country, its capability and proven track record of\r\ncontributing to the promotion of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment, both regionally and globally, and its\r\ncommitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in\r\npermanent membership. It may also be timely and pertinent\r\nto review the manner in which the veto is exercised at\r\npresent with a view to mitigating its arbitrary use and to\r\nensuring a more democratic decision-making process.\r\nOne central challenge not yet fully met by the United\r\nNations in its fiftieth year is that of general disarmament,\r\nparticularly in its nuclear dimension. The 1995 Review and\r\nExtension Conference of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) adopted three\r\ndecisions, namely, to extend the Treaty indefinitely, to\r\nstrengthen its review process and to agree on certain\r\nprinciples and objectives for non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament. Yet the Conference failed to address the\r\ninequalities inherent in the Treaty. Issues long identified\r\nas crucial components of the non-proliferation regime\r\nwere marginalized. The indefinite extension of the NPT\r\nremoved the element of urgency from obligations under\r\narticle VI of the Treaty, which may legitimize existing\r\nnuclear arsenals and perpetuate their further\r\nmodernization. Hence, our priority agenda in the\r\ndisarmament field should continue to be one of seeking\r\nfurther deep reductions in those arsenals with a view to\r\ntheir ultimate, total elimination, curbing the horizontal and\r\nvertical proliferation of nuclear weapons, banning the\r\nproduction of fissile materials for weapons purposes,\r\nensuring the peaceful applications of nuclear technology\r\non a predictable and long-term basis, initiating\r\nnegotiations towards an international convention on\r\nsecurity assurances to non-nuclear States, and concluding\r\nthe ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty.\r\nIt is in this context that we have deplored the\r\nunderground testing by France and China, not only\r\nbecause of health and environmental considerations but\r\nprecisely because it contravenes the spirit of the 1995\r\nReview and Extension Conference of the NPT and\r\nundermines the ongoing efforts to conclude a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. While urging the nuclear\r\nPowers to desist from conducting further tests, we believe\r\nit is imperative that concerted efforts should now be\r\ndirected at achieving a treaty banning nuclear testing in\r\nall environments and for all time, without any loopholes\r\nor exceptions, by 1996.\r\nPerhaps the greatest tragedy of recent times is that\r\nwhich has befallen the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe brutal aggression perpetrated again this independent\r\nMember State of the United Nations and the slaughter and\r\n“ethnic cleansing” of its people have shocked the whole\r\nworld. Denied its legitimate right to defend itself as a\r\nresult of an unjust arms embargo, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina faces the prospect of the forcible dismantling\r\nof its multicultural, multi-ethnic and multireligious society\r\nand the erosion of its internationally recognized\r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.\r\nThe major Powers, which early on could have put an\r\nend to this tragedy, have failed the cause of justice and of\r\na principled solution, offering instead rationalizations for\r\nwhat clearly amounts to a policy of appeasement. Only\r\nnow, after an excruciating wait, have the United Nations\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) finally\r\ntaken firm action. On the ground, the tide of battle seems\r\nto be turning, while at the same time a new peace process\r\nis unfolding which appears to have some viability.\r\nIndonesia welcomes the accords recently reached between\r\nthe Foreign Ministers of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, comprised of a set of broad\r\nprinciples that are to govern a peaceful settlement of the\r\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Developments have\r\nthus entered a crucial stage, and it is of paramount\r\nimportance for the international community to ensure that\r\nneither an unjust nor an unworkable peace be forced on\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIn this regard, President Soeharto has offered\r\nIndonesia’s good offices to facilitate a peace process based\r\non direct negotiations among the leaders of the States\r\ndirectly involved in the conflict. These negotiations should\r\nbe conducted on the basis of certain basic principles, such\r\nas peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal\r\naffairs. Any settlement should take into account existing\r\nUnited Nations resolutions and existing proposals for\r\nsettlement and should entail mutual recognition by the\r\nStates that were components of the former Yugoslavia,\r\nrespect for internationally recognized boundaries and\r\nprotection of minorities. Furthermore, the process should\r\nproceed in stages, from direct negotiations between the\r\nleaders themselves to an appropriately structured\r\ninternational conference, to be held when agreement has\r\nbeen reached on the basic elements of a settlement.\r\nIn the Middle East the pursuit of peace has continued\r\nto gather momentum. The historic Declaration of Principles\r\nsigned two years ago was bolstered by the agreement\r\nreached last week between the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO) and Israel, which calls for an extension\r\nof Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories, phased\r\nwithdrawal of Israeli forces and free elections for a\r\nPalestinian Council, thereby paving the way for a final\r\nsettlement of the Palestinian-Israeli dimension of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict. Indonesia welcomes the agreement as an\r\nimportant watershed in the Middle East peace process. But\r\nthe path to a lasting peace still faces major hurdles and\r\nchallenges, including those posed by Israeli settlements in\r\nthe West Bank, the unresolved question of Palestinian\r\nrefugees 50 years after they were forced to flee their\r\nhomeland and the status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. At the same\r\ntime, progress must also be achieved on the other tracks of\r\nthe Arab-Israeli negotiations, which is a sine qua non for a\r\ncomprehensive settlement of the Middle East question. The\r\nultimate guarantee for a durable and just peace is Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from all occupied territories, including the\r\nSyrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.\r\nThe global economy today is reportedly at its\r\nstrongest in many years. According to the World\r\nEconomic and Social Survey of 1995, it has attained an\r\naverage growth in output of 3 per cent per year. But the\r\nrising tide of production has not lifted all economies.\r\nThus, notwithstanding the promise of global recovery,\r\nover 2 billion people remain poverty-stricken, often under\r\ncircumstances of extreme deprivation. Up to 18 million\r\ndie annually from hunger, malnutrition and poverty-\r\nrelated causes. The gap between the haves and the have-\r\nnots continues to widen, doubling in size over the past\r\nthree decades between the richest 20 per cent and the\r\npoorest.\r\nPolicy decisions affecting the developing countries\r\nare increasingly being made by international agencies or\r\ngroups, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\r\nthe World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nand the Group of Seven. It even seems that the United\r\nNations itself is being marginalized, as decision-making\r\non international economic and financial issues continues\r\nto shift to the Bretton Woods institutions, where the\r\nparticipation of the developing countries is less equitable.\r\nIt is no secret that some countries would like to\r\ninaugurate a global system in which finance and\r\nmacroeconomic management become the exclusive\r\ndomain of the IMF, development strategies that of the\r\nWorld Bank and international trade matters that of the\r\nWTO.\r\nI submit, however, that given the expanding role of\r\nthe developing countries in the world economy and the\r\ngrowing interdependence between States, the participation\r\nof developing countries should be enhanced rather than\r\ncurtailed. The solution of global economic problems\r\nrequires a global partnership for development, and that\r\npartnership cannot be forged without sustained dialogue\r\nand cooperation on key economic issues between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries. This is why, after\r\nthe Jakarta summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, where\r\neconomic development was restored to the top of its\r\nagenda, the Movement sought to relaunch a constructive\r\ndialogue between the North and the South based on\r\nmutual interest, common benefit and equitably shared\r\nresponsibility. That kind of dialogue has been welcomed\r\nin this Assembly, and it is our hope that other key players\r\nin the globalization process, such as non-governmental\r\norganizations, transnational corporations and international\r\nfinancial institutions, will in time also join that dialogue.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nJust as important is the revitalization of the institutions\r\nwhich the United Nations Charter set in place 50 years ago\r\nto lay the social and economic foundations for peace. We\r\nmust ensure, however, that in the process we will\r\nstrengthen the role of the developing countries in decision-\r\nmaking and enhance the democratic character of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is in this context that I have opposed the idea of\r\nestablishing an economic security council to take the place\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, because it is bound to\r\nfrustrate our efforts to democratize the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations. As to the attendant suggestion to wind up\r\nthe work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), I believe, to the\r\ncontrary, that these two bodies are vital to the achievement\r\nof accelerated, sustainable and equitably spread\r\ndevelopment, especially for the developing countries. Since\r\nits establishment 30 years ago, UNCTAD has consistently\r\nendeavoured to redress the inequities and imbalances in the\r\nworld economy and to give a greater voice and role to the\r\ndeveloping countries in its management. UNIDO, too, has\r\nproven to be of concrete benefit to the developing\r\ncountries, in particular in their efforts to accelerate their\r\nindustrial development. Both UNCTAD and UNIDO,\r\ntherefore, should be strengthened rather than be allowed to\r\nbe whittled down or eliminated.\r\nWe believe that the problems now plaguing many\r\ndeveloping countries could have been forestalled if they had\r\nadequate access to international markets, to financial\r\nresources and to appropriate technologies. And while we\r\nexpect that the results of the Uruguay Round will alleviate\r\nthe crisis by liberalizing the international trading system,\r\nwe also know that the lion’s share of the benefits will\r\naccrue to the developed countries. This imbalance is due to\r\nthe significant loss of differential treatment in trade for the\r\ndeveloping countries, the limited progress achieved in\r\nlifting restrictions on agricultural exports and the imposition\r\nof trade conditionalities based on labour codes,\r\neco-labelling and so on. If the new trading regime is to\r\nhave a positive impact on the developing countries, these\r\nproblems and imbalances should be squarely addressed, and\r\nthe rights and interests of the developing countries,\r\nparticularly the least developed among them, should be\r\nupheld.\r\nAmid such trends as increasing globalization, the\r\nintegration of global financial markets and speculation\r\nduring periods of national adjustment to privatization, the\r\ndeveloping countries have become increasingly vulnerable.\r\nAmong the developing countries, those in Africa are\r\nparticularly disadvantaged because their external-debt\r\nproblems have virtually excluded them from investment\r\nflows — they must rely on official development\r\nassistance (ODA), which continues to decline. At the\r\nsame time, negative financial flows continue to hamper\r\ntheir development efforts. In 1994 alone the continent’s\r\nindebtedness was double that of other developing\r\ncountries. It is therefore incumbent upon the international\r\ncommunity to give its priority attention to the critical\r\nsituation in Africa.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development,\r\nconvened earlier this year in Copenhagen, underscored the\r\ndetermination of the international community to raise\r\nglobal standards of living and to address the problems of\r\npoverty, unemployment and social integration. Its\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action offer a pragmatic\r\nand feasible course to alleviate mass human suffering and\r\nto elevate the human condition. Now we must translate\r\nrhetoric into action, and realize the true potential for\r\nglobal prosperity.\r\nAn integral part of that process is the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration and Platform for\r\nAction adopted at the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, recently concluded in Beijing. For only through\r\nthe empowerment and advancement of women by such\r\nmeans as access to economic resources, to education and\r\nto the decision-making processes in all fields and at all\r\nlevels can the social and economic welfare of humankind\r\nprogress. It is essential, therefore, that we create an\r\nenvironment conducive to women’s full participation in\r\nthe development process, as both its agents and its\r\nbeneficiaries, if we are to move forward in our efforts to\r\nachieve sustained economic growth, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and social justice.\r\nThe observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations is particularly significant to us in\r\nIndonesia, for it takes place while we celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the proclamation of our independence. To\r\nus, this is not a mere coincidence in time but a\r\nconvergence of ideals and values. Neither is it a\r\ncoincidence that the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nConstitution of Indonesia embrace the same principles and\r\nobjectives, such as independence, social justice, equality\r\nand abiding peace. For the United Nations and Indonesia\r\nemerged from the crucible of the Second World War and\r\nthe struggle for independence yearning and hoping for the\r\nuniversal peace that can only be derived from a sharing\r\nof the fruits of freedom and justice by all humankind.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nSince then, the United Nations and all of us, the\r\npeoples who are its constituents, have gone through another\r\ncrucible, that of the cold war and the massive global\r\nchanges that attended its wake. And, again, we have\r\nemerged with a yearning and a hope that the peace\r\nenvisaged in the United Nations Charter 50 years ago will\r\nbe attained in our time. The difference is that this time we\r\nhave 50 years of experience to illuminate our endeavours\r\nand to sharpen our perspective of the future. On this\r\noccasion, as we rededicate ourselves to the vision of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, let us resolve to use our collective\r\nexperience in our continuing efforts to revitalize and\r\nstrengthen the Organization that is the vehicle of our hope.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International\r\nCooperation of Cambodia, His Excellency Mr. Ung Huot.\r\nMr. Ung Huot (Cambodia): First of all, I wish to\r\nextend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral and his glorious country,\r\nPortugal, my delegation’s heartfelt congratulations on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. I am certain that his\r\nleadership talent and experiences will enable us to meet the\r\nserious challenges that we face in today’s quickly changing\r\nworld. I wish to assure him of our full cooperation.\r\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I would like\r\nto join the heads of delegation who have preceded me in\r\nthe pleasant task of expressing thanks and admiration to the\r\nPresident of the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, for the\r\ntremendous contribution he made over the course of a\r\nproductive and historic year.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia wishes also to thank the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nstrong and effective work, which has been so instrumental\r\nin the success of this Organization. We are all aware of the\r\nSecretary-General’s great achievement in his handling of\r\nCambodia’s problem. My country is very proud of him.\r\nCambodia now enjoys peace, freedom and democracy\r\nthanks to the representatives of all the Member States, who\r\nhave contributed so much in this peace process with us.\r\nCambodia wishes to pay special tribute to the courage of\r\nthe United Nations peace-keepers who died for peace and\r\nfreedom on Cambodian soil alongside thousands of other\r\ncompatriots.\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia is working in\r\nclose cooperation with the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General in Cambodia, the Honourable Benny\r\nWidyono. His presence is of the utmost importance to\r\nCambodia. He performs his duty with excellence and is\r\nhighly commended by the Government and the people of\r\nCambodia.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia appreciated the work of\r\nthe Honourable Justice Michael Kirby, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Representative for Human Rights in\r\nCambodia. Through close cooperation and regular\r\nconsultations with him, and the United Nations Centre for\r\nHuman Rights, steps are being taken to improve the\r\nhuman rights situation in the country. Cambodia,\r\nhowever, continues to support the presence and the work\r\nof the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. It is\r\nmaking valuable contributions to and recommendations\r\nfor the improvement of the overall situation in Cambodia.\r\nIt is with great honour and pride that I address this\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly, for the first\r\ntime, as the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia.\r\nThe Royal Government today, under the leadership of\r\nboth the First Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Prince\r\nNorodom Ranariddh, and the Second Prime Minister,\r\nSamdech Hun Sen, is now more than two years old. It\r\nwas the result of a democratic election organized and\r\nsupervised by the United Nations. It is a product of the\r\nmultilateral efforts of the United Nations with the close\r\ncooperation of the Cambodian people, under the wise\r\nguidance and leadership of His Majesty King Norodom\r\nSihanouk Varman.\r\nThrough the determination of the Cambodian people,\r\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia today has emerged from a\r\nlong period of destruction and war, with many challenges\r\nand opportunities to build a better future. In the past two\r\nyears, the Royal Government has made important\r\nprogress and achieved some of the most important work\r\nin nation-building, peace-building and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAfter the United Nations-sponsored election in May\r\n1993 the two main political parties combined their efforts\r\nand formed a coalition Government, which has shown\r\nitself to be able to work closely in an efficient manner.\r\nThese achievements were only possible with the support\r\nand assistance of the international community.\r\nWith peace-building, Cambodia has further\r\nconsolidated sustainable peace, security and stability,\r\nwhich are the necessary conditions for economic\r\ndevelopment and nation-building. We have been dealing\r\nwith the task of reforming the military, the police and the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nadministration for some time now, in order to improve the\r\npublic sectors so that they can serve the needs and interests\r\nof the Cambodian people and the private sector. At the\r\nsame time, the Royal Government and the National\r\nAssembly are working very closely together to make\r\nCambodia a State based on the rule of law. Cambodia is\r\nnow concentrating more effort, time, energy and funds on\r\nnation-building and economic development. In this respect,\r\nCambodia is a nation in the making.\r\nOn the economic front, Cambodia is working closely\r\nwith international financial institutions, particularly the\r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the\r\nAsian Development Bank and the Caisse Française pour le\r\nDeveloppement to ensure that the process of rehabilitation\r\nand transition to a market economy is well under way.\r\nDespite some difficulties during the period immediately\r\nfollowing the elections, progress in economic development\r\nthus far is very encouraging. According to the latest report\r\nfrom the IMF, dated 15 September 1995,\r\n“The improved financial discipline has led to an\r\nincreasingly stable economic environment, as is\r\nevident in the stability of the exchange rate after the\r\nwide fluctuations of previous years.”\r\nMr Gurirab (Namibia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nFor the period from 1995 to 1997 the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia is targeting a 7 per cent growth rate. The\r\ninflation rate was brought down from 200 per cent for the\r\nperiod before the election to 31 per cent in 1993 and to 18\r\nper cent in 1994. An inflation rate of below 10 per cent has\r\nbeen projected for 1995. These improvements are linked to\r\nthe pursuit of structural reforms in the financial sector, civil\r\nservice, military and public enterprises. It is important to\r\nnote here that a privatization law was adopted in December\r\n1994, and private investments approved and formalized by\r\nthe Council for the Development of Cambodia from August\r\n1994 to May 1995 are estimated at $2.5 billion, compared\r\nto $621 million of private investment approved during the\r\n1991 to 1993 period.\r\nThe Royal Government is pleased to inform you, Sir,\r\nand the Assembly that the National Programme to\r\nRehabilitate and Develop Cambodia has made great\r\nprogress in articulating the Government’s overall and\r\nsectoral policies and programmes.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nFirst Country Programme for Cambodia for 1994-1995 has\r\nhelped establish three important priorities: first,\r\nmodernizing and restructuring the country; secondly,\r\npoverty alleviation and sustainable management of the\r\nenvironment; and, thirdly, natural resources.\r\nIn this regard, Cambodia wishes to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his appeal for the implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries for the 1990s, especially for the five main\r\nobjectives: first, the lifting of the debt burden; secondly,\r\na greater flow of finance to the least developed countries\r\n(LDCs); thirdly, a more favourable trade environment for\r\nthe LDCs; fourthly, encouragement for partnership in\r\nLDCs; and, fifthly, a proper infrastructure within LDCs.\r\nThe economic and financial situation in Cambodia is\r\nevolving positively, and the performance criteria\r\nsubscribed to by the Government with international\r\norganizations have been achieved. While these are good\r\nsigns for improving the economic situation in Cambodia,\r\npoverty is still a major problem, particularly in rural\r\nareas, where development is moving at a slower pace.\r\nRural development has been hampered in some parts of\r\nthe country by the continuing problem of landmines. With\r\ninternational and bilateral assistance, the Cambodian Mine\r\nAction Centre is working towards making Cambodia a\r\nlandmine-free country. It will take time, effort and\r\nsupport from the international community to accomplish\r\nthat task.\r\nThis year the Kingdom of Cambodia has officially\r\nacceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-\r\nEast Asia. It has become an observer member in the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is\r\nnow a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).\r\nCambodia is actively engaged in improving and\r\nexpanding ties with all countries throughout the world.\r\nSince 1993, with its open door policy and the policy of\r\npositive engagement, Cambodia has rejoined the\r\ncommunity of nations and is working closely with others\r\nto promote world peace and international security. So far\r\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia has established diplomatic\r\nrelations with 87 countries from all continents.\r\nCambodia has also taken steps towards full\r\nintegration into ASEAN. As an observer member of\r\nASEAN, Cambodia may participate in important ASEAN\r\nmeetings. In December this year Cambodia will for the\r\nfirst time participate in the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok,\r\nThailand. Cambodia welcomed Vietnam’s full\r\nmembership of ASEAN, Lao aspirations to become a full\r\nmember by 1997 and Myanmar’s accession to the Treaty\r\nof Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia, to become\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nan observer, and looks to the day when all the countries of\r\nSouth-East Asia form an ASEAN-10. At the same time,\r\nCambodia welcomes the recent positive trends in the\r\ncontinuing development and growth of the Asia-Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation (APEC). While sustainable\r\neconomic development and growth are crucial for us all, it\r\nis important that development works to further enhance\r\npeace and stability for the whole world. The long-term\r\nsolution being widespread economic development,\r\nCambodia wishes to assure the Assembly of its support for\r\nthe newly created World Trade Organization.\r\nI turn to the question of world peace and international\r\nsecurity. Cambodia is very concerned about the situation in\r\nAfghanistan. We support a peaceful settlement of the\r\nconflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia.\r\nContinuing war in these countries will have serious\r\nrepercussions on international security.\r\nCambodia warmly welcomed the major agreement\r\nconcluded between Israel and the Palestinians on Sunday,\r\n24 September 1995. We support and encourage the\r\ncontinuing efforts of the Israeli and Palestinian people to\r\nbuild peace, freedom and harmony between them.\r\nCambodia is very happy to see that Mrs. Aung San\r\nSuu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy of\r\nMyanmar, was freed last July by the State Law and Order\r\nRestoration Council. We welcome this latest move by\r\nMyanmar.\r\nWe note with great concern the role of the United\r\nNations peace-keepers. Ten years ago they numbered only\r\n4,000, but now, as new conflicts pop up like mushrooms,\r\ntheir number has risen to over 70,000. A new situation has\r\nalso emerged wherein the credibility of the peace-keepers\r\nis constantly being challenged. We must find a mechanism\r\nto strengthen the role of the peace-keepers and give them\r\nbetter support and protection against the evil forces that are\r\nout to weaken and destroy them. It is in this context that\r\nwe applaud the new role assigned to the peace-keepers in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We pray for the success of the\r\npeace talks, led by the distinguished American diplomat\r\nRichard Holbrooke, between Croatia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the Bosnian Serbs.\r\nThe subject of the United Nations Conference on\r\nWomen, held in Beijing this year, was very timely. Since\r\nthe formation of the Provisional Government in June 1993,\r\nCambodia has been conscious of the rights of women.\r\nCambodia now has in the Government a National\r\nSecretariat for Women’s Affairs, which promotes greater\r\nrecognition of the roles of women in society. The Royal\r\nGovernment sent a delegation of women, headed by Her\r\nRoyal Highness Princess Marie Norodom Ranariddh, to\r\nBeijing.\r\nWith regard to nuclear testing, as a Party to the\r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Cambodia\r\nstrongly supports a ban on all nuclear testing around the\r\nworld. As we have just concluded the 1995 Review and\r\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, nuclear tests\r\nanywhere, whether atmospheric or underground, are of\r\nmajor concern for all of us in terms of the health, safety\r\nand well-being of humankind. The Kingdom of Cambodia\r\nnotes with satisfaction that progress is being made on the\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, and we applaud the\r\nagreement that has been reached on the mandate with\r\nregard to the production of fissile materials for weapons.\r\nWe are very happy to see the encouraging sign from the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in\r\naugmenting application of the NPT’s safeguards\r\nprovisions.\r\nAs one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, Cambodia looks forward with great\r\nenthusiasm to participating in the ninth Summit\r\nConference of Heads of State or Government of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries, to be held this year in Cartagena\r\nde Indias, Colombia.\r\nWe applaud the professional skill and chairmanship\r\nof His Excellency President Soeharto of the Republic of\r\nIndonesia during the last three years, as leader of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nCambodia is very happy to welcome the next\r\nChairman of our Movement, His Excellency President\r\nErnesto Samper, President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMy delegation wishes to assure him that he will receive\r\nthe fullest cooperation from Cambodia. We are convinced\r\nthat he will, in a very spirited way, keep our Movement\r\nin the international agenda spotlight.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of this\r\nimportant Organization, an Organization that we should\r\nall be proud of, Cambodia calls for the strengthening and\r\nenhancement of the role of the United Nations, and urges\r\nthat we move towards global peace-building and harmony.\r\nRemember that our Organization was built on the very\r\nidea of preventing and ending all conflicts and sufferings,\r\nand remember also that this same idea was made possible\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nin the case of Cambodia. Cambodia, I am very proud to\r\nsay, is one of the success stories of our Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Andorra, His Excellency Mr. Manuel\r\nMas Ribó.\r\nMr. Mas Ribó (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): It is only right to begin by thanking the\r\noutgoing President, Minister Amara Essy, who has done so\r\nmuch for our Organization during the past year, and by\r\ncongratulating the incoming President, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral. On behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nAndorra, I wish him every success and good fortune in his\r\nimportant task. I have no doubt that this distinguished\r\npersonality from the Iberian peninsula, for whom I have\r\ngreat respect and fraternal esteem, will take the helm of this\r\nAssembly with a firm hand.\r\nFor the last 50 years Heads of State, Heads of\r\nGovernment, Ministers and Ambassadors have been coming\r\nbefore this General Assembly of the United Nations to set\r\nout, with hope and with passion, their desire for world\r\npeace and the development of our planet. Year after year\r\ndignitaries from all corners of the globe have met in New\r\nYork to reiterate the ideals conceived in San Francisco five\r\ndecades ago. It is thus an honour and a privilege for me to\r\ndo the same today, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, a very old and very small nation,\r\na State that is the fruit of 700 years of peace and\r\nindependence.\r\nThe celebration of anniversaries allows people to\r\npause briefly to look back on their past, to reflect, to draw\r\nconclusions and to try to better prepare their future. Fifty\r\nyears after the horrors of the Second World War, “We the\r\npeoples of the United Nations” now have the task of\r\nreaffirming the importance of our Organization by\r\nconsolidating its founding principles and giving impetus to\r\nthe reform of the United Nations so as to make it a modern,\r\nefficient instrument for the new international order that has\r\narisen since the end of the cold war.\r\nThe founding principles of the United Nations could\r\nbe summed up as follows: equality of States, tolerance, the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe principle of the equality of States is dear to all\r\nsmall States. The preamble to the Charter of the United\r\nNations refers to all nations, large and small. In the\r\nGeneral Assembly each State has one vote.\r\nA sovereign State is not only a group — whatever\r\nits size — of people; it is a history, a language, the will\r\nof a people, a sense of independence — in a word, a\r\ncommunity of human beings. Some States, like ours,\r\nAndorra, have only 60,000 inhabitants. Others have more\r\nthan a billion. But all have the right to speak and vote at\r\nthe United Nations. And, just as peace comes into being\r\nwhen the powerful respect the small, the rule of law\r\nbecomes reality in international affairs when all are\r\ntreated as equals and when parties can solve their\r\ndifferences at the negotiating table, not on the field of\r\ndevastation that results from the use of force.\r\nLast year, the Head of Government of Andorra\r\nstressed from this very rostrum that by their very nature,\r\nsmall States intrinsically and essentially maintain the\r\nvalues of respect for diversity and of peaceful\r\ncoexistence. To create a world balanced by the rule of\r\nlaw in a world of instincts, exchanges must be based on\r\nthe principle of equality between States.\r\nNevertheless, the principle of equality should not be\r\nreduced to the formula “one State, one vote”. The\r\nprinciple of equality springs from the desire to understand\r\nthe other, to allow diversity and to exchange different\r\nvisions of humankind and society. The principle of\r\nequality derives from the concept of tolerance. In this\r\nInternational Year of Tolerance, we must be particularly\r\naware of the central position of this idea. The United\r\nNations cannot exist without tolerance. It would surely be\r\nabsurd to meet in this Assembly if all that were to come\r\nout of it was the prevention and outlawing of the opinions\r\nof others. Though it is sometimes considered less heroic\r\nthan force, diplomacy is the supreme instrument we have\r\nin this forum, an instrument for respect and\r\nunderstanding.\r\nWe in Andorra have resorted to diplomacy from\r\nhistorical necessity from very early times; these 700 years\r\nof peace of which we are so proud are probably the\r\nresult. We have also had to be tolerant and to respect\r\nothers because, during the numerous conflicts that have\r\nshaken the European continent over the centuries, we\r\nhave sheltered on our territory those in search of asylum,\r\nfrom whichever side they came. We have learned, I\r\nrepeat, of necessity, being weak and humble like all small\r\nStates, how to differ without imposing ourselves.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nLet us give tolerance the importance it deserves as a\r\nfounding principle of the United Nations. But tolerance\r\ndoes not mean laissez faire. Just as John Stuart Mill set the\r\nlimits of individual freedom at the point at which that\r\nfreedom infringed on the liberty of others, tolerance is\r\nlimited only by intolerance. The United Nations has the\r\npower to say “no” to those States and peoples who do not\r\nrespect the religious, political, moral and artistic convictions\r\nof others; “no” to those States and peoples who do not\r\nrespect minorities, be they national or of any other kind,\r\nand their languages, which are an essential element of\r\ncultural transmission; “no”, above all, when repression is\r\naccompanied by the use of force and by cruelty, torture and\r\nother unspeakable acts. That is why, since joining the\r\nUnited Nations, my country has attached such importance\r\nto the Third Committee of the General Assembly and to\r\nquestions of human rights. Last year, Andorra took an\r\nactive part in the debate on capital punishment, applying\r\nthe constitutional ideas approved by its people, which loves\r\nlife and believes in it.\r\nThe United Nations was not built in a vacuum of\r\nvalues — quite the contrary. When, in June 1945, the right\r\nwords were being sought in San Francisco for the United\r\nNations Charter, those that were found were based on a\r\nvery clear vision of the dignity of the human being with a\r\nuniversal vocation. The Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, adopted by the United Nations on 10 December\r\n1948, made clear once and for all what was, is and will be\r\nacceptable and desirable, and what is not, in order that the\r\ninalienable dignity of every human being should be\r\nrespected and the limits of tolerance demarcated by\r\ndefining what we consider to be intolerable.\r\nFor instance, we find intolerable the ethnic and\r\nreligious intolerance that leads to disasters like those which\r\nthe horror-struck international community has been obliged\r\nto witness in the territories that were once part of\r\nYugoslavia. To face up to these challenges, the United\r\nNations has made a considerable effort in recent years to\r\ncarry out large-scale operations to keep the peace. The\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, informed us\r\non 3 January this year in his supplement to “An Agenda for\r\nPeace” of the considerable increase in the deployment of\r\nmilitary personnel since 1988. On 31 January of that year,\r\n9,570 “blue helmets” were engaged in peace-keeping\r\noperations; as at 16 December last year, there were 73,393.\r\nThe near non-use of the veto in the Security Council\r\nsince the end of the cold war has encouraged this growth in\r\ndeployment. Very often, unfortunately, we hear so much\r\ntalk of the failures of United Nations operations that we\r\nforget to mention the successes. When we now celebrate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, we should\r\nproclaim it aloud: the role of the United Nations has been\r\nessential, and the results are highly positive. Let us not\r\nask the United Nations to do what the Organization\r\ncannot do, and has no vocation to do, making it the target\r\nof criticisms better levelled at the paralysis of Member\r\nStates. The United Nations is and will be what the\r\nMember States wish it to be, neither more nor less, and\r\nwithout miracles.\r\nThe complexity of the conflicts now afflicting the\r\nworld, as the Secretary-General has on several occasions\r\npointed out, lies in the fact that most of them are conflicts\r\nwithin the borders of States, or former States. This makes\r\nthem more complicated than the conflicts we were\r\naccustomed to during the years of the cold war, mainly\r\nbecause in many cases the target for destruction is the\r\ncivilian population, and secondly because the task of the\r\nhumanitarian organizations and the soldiers sent to keep\r\nthe peace is not respected by the parties to the conflict,\r\nwhich consider them as abetting the enemy.\r\nThe action for peace taken by the United Nations, an\r\nOrganization founded on the ruins of a ferocious war,\r\nmust be constant. It is our imperative duty to eliminate\r\nwar and to cut off conflicts at the root. We all know the\r\nrecommendations listed by the Secretary-General in his\r\n“An Agenda for Peace”, so I shall not repeat them. But\r\nI will underline the importance in the opinion of my\r\nGovernment of preventive diplomacy. Precisely because\r\nAndorra came into being as a result of a peace agreement\r\nsigned in 1278, which made our territory completely\r\nneutral and which called for the destruction of all castles\r\nand warlike fortifications, we can well understand the\r\npossibility of stopping conflicts in time by means of\r\npeace agreements that neutralize the power to harm of the\r\ncontenders by removing both parties’ access to\r\narmaments.\r\nBut the United Nations and we, its Members, must\r\nhave the courage to act when the first signs of a conflict\r\nlead us to suspect its existence. The world today needs an\r\ninternational authority to facilitate dialogue, to suggest\r\ncompromises acceptable to the parties to the conflict —\r\nabove all, when the conflict is in its initial stages — and\r\nto confirm the agreements reached by negotiation. The\r\nUnited Nations has demonstrated that it is such an\r\ninstitution, and it would be unjust not to recognize this\r\ngreat merit during this anniversary. Let us imagine a\r\nworld without the United Nations, where force\r\npredominated over law, where there were no standard\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nuniversal values for which to strive, where the human\r\ncommunity, which is capable of the highest and most noble\r\nacts, fell into a vortex of egoism, war and destruction. The\r\nUnited Nations is not optional in this world of\r\ninterdependent States, but indispensable.\r\nPlease allow me at this stage to evaluate the relevance\r\nof Andorra’s modern development in this regard. As I have\r\nsaid, Andorra is a land of peace, welcome and friendship.\r\nDuring the more than 700 years of its existence with its\r\nown national identity, particularly in this century, when\r\nwars have shaken our neighbour States and Europe,\r\nAndorra has been a place of refuge, of asylum and of\r\npeaceful coexistence. It is precisely now, when 50 years\r\nhave passed since the founding of the United Nations as a\r\nresult of the events of that tragic phase in human history,\r\nand when we must still regret that irrationality is sowing\r\ndeath and cruelty in many places throughout the world, that\r\nwe would like to recall, humbly, but with a firmness\r\ninformed by the realities of our history, the deep and\r\nsincere conviction that Andorra can bring to the world.\r\nThere can be no difficulty in peaceful coexistence if there\r\nis good will and understanding. There can be no\r\ninfringement of tolerance if there is respect for people and\r\nideas. In a word, magnanimity and indulgence will always\r\nbe more effective than ignominy and opprobrium.\r\nFrom Andorra we proclaim peace; we call for it and,\r\nif necessary, we demand it as a universal possession that no\r\none has the right to change or to violate. When there is\r\nserious aggression against nature and the environment,\r\nwhen materialism and speculation seek to obliterate\r\nhumanism and sensitivity, when the hypocrisy of interests\r\novercomes the reality of ideals, a generous-spirited common\r\neffort must be made to find the path of peace and\r\ncoexistence.\r\nThe Andorran Constitution enshrines respect for and\r\nthe promotion of freedom, equality, justice and tolerance,\r\nand the defence of human rights and individual dignity.\r\nWith that background, we forcefully insist before the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the primary purpose of mankind is\r\nto achieve peace, without reservation and without ulterior\r\nmotive. None of us here can be satisfied with the results\r\nuntil one day we can announce the great news that peace\r\nreigns on Earth. The near-universality of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the spirit of which\r\nAndorra has always respected, is a positive example of that\r\ncommon task. It thus gives me pleasure today to announce\r\nthat the Government of Andorra has submitted the Treaty\r\nto its Parliament for ratification.\r\nPeace must be promoted. By every possible means,\r\nespecially through education, we must spread the word\r\neverywhere that only tolerance, common sense,\r\nunderstanding, good will, solidarity, respect for cultural\r\ndiversity with its intellectual and spiritual stimulation,\r\nvariety and the struggle for social progress and\r\nbrotherhood can lead to peace and can provide pride and\r\ndignity to all human beings while eliminating\r\nintransigence and racial, religious, social and political\r\nhatred, which are at the root of all conflicts between\r\npeoples and civilizations.\r\nThere must be an end to the horrors and atrocities of\r\nthe wars that continue to take place in our civilized world\r\namid alarming indifference. These threats affect us all; we\r\nmust find the means to prevent violence against society\r\nand against individuals. It is not enough to cry out in\r\ncompassion or frustration, or to make the excuse that we\r\nare the victims of modern times, as Anthony Burgess put\r\nit in his novel A Clockwork Orange. There must be\r\ndetermination if we are to be able to say that we all have\r\na future. There must be serious, unhesitating commitment\r\non the part of those bearing the heaviest responsibility,\r\nparticularly with respect to the economic consequences,\r\nwhich are in fact predominant in causing certain\r\nscandalous situations and in keeping them alive. We must\r\nact with morality if we are to be able to face repeated\r\naggression against human rights. It would be wonderful\r\nif we could all make an unstinting effort to emerge from\r\nthe shadows and if, with one voice, we could set up the\r\nmachinery that would make peace triumph forever, and\r\ncould understand — in the words of François Mitterrand,\r\nformer President of the French Republic and therefore\r\nformer Co-Prince of Andorra — that “awareness of\r\ninjustice is not enough to combat injustice”.\r\nAs we strive towards peace let us always remember\r\nthat we can never reach the development goals set by\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment” without reducing the warlike and military\r\nactivities of the poorest countries. Let us face the facts:\r\ndevelopment makes for peace, but without peace, without\r\neliminating unnecessary spending on military equipment,\r\nwithout agreement among Governments that rightly\r\ndemand a better future for their citizens, there will be no\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBut this must not mean a relaxation of the\r\ndevelopment efforts that Member States and the\r\nOrganization itself have always promoted. Day after day\r\nin the field, the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) carry out work that is far too\r\nimportant not to enjoy our sincere support. I take this\r\nopportunity to announce that during my stay in New York\r\nI signed, on behalf of the Government of Andorra, the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, which reflects my\r\ncountry’s recognition of the cause promoted by that great\r\ntext. Men and women like the late James Grant — who at\r\nUNICEF carried out such tasks and contributed to the well-\r\nbeing of so many children throughout the world —\r\ndemonstrate the productive vitality of the United Nations.\r\nWe in Andorra are much concerned with questions of\r\ndevelopment. Despite our modest means and small territory,\r\nwe feel solidarity with victims of malnutrition, hunger,\r\nsickness and the lack of educational opportunities. Our\r\nforeign policy at the United Nations has been oriented in\r\nthat direction. Last March, the Andorran Head of\r\nGovernment brought to Copenhagen a message of\r\nsolidarity, and declared that poverty was not inevitable.\r\nAndorra is a small State; we are therefore convinced that,\r\napart from the importance of large programmes and their\r\ninevitable macro-amplitudes, social development is a more\r\naccessible goal when it is approached on a small scale, at\r\nthe level of the community or indeed of the family.\r\nHence, the Declaration of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development includes a commitment proposed by\r\nAndorra, which we shall invoke in our work in the\r\nAssembly’s Main Committees. This commitment urges us\r\nto\r\n“Acknowledge and encourage the contribution of\r\npeople of all age groups as equally and vitally\r\nimportant for the building of a harmonious society,\r\nand foster dialogue between generations in all parts of\r\nsociety”. (A/CONF.166/9, para. 29, commitment 4 (h))\r\nHuman beings, happily, are living longer, and their\r\nnumbers are growing. We must find new ways to guarantee\r\nthe balance of the social contract between generations, and\r\nmake social integration — one of the pillars of\r\ndevelopment — work. To that end, we need to devote\r\nspecial attention to the problems of unemployment and the\r\nsocial integration of young people, particularly this year as\r\nwe mark the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year.\r\nI have instructed our Permanent Representative to the\r\nUnited Nations to devote time and resources to initiating a\r\ndialogue with his counterparts on the question of youth.\r\nWe have recently seen how three great conferences —\r\nthose of Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing — focused the\r\nattention of the international community. Cairo addressed\r\nproblems of population, Copenhagen those of poverty and\r\nsocial development, and Beijing the question of women.\r\nIt is vital that the conclusions of these high-level meetings\r\nnot become a dead letter; all Member States must assess\r\ntheir results and consider their concrete applications, both\r\nat home and throughout the world. But Cairo,\r\nCopenhagen and Beijing must not overshadow other\r\nsimilar conferences. I am thinking of Rio de Janeiro and\r\nits impact on environmental policy. A country of the\r\nPyrenees, like Andorra, cannot shirk its environmental\r\nresponsibilities; that is why the office of Andorra’s\r\nSecretary-General for the environment has drawn up\r\nvaluable initiatives to protect our ecosystem, our flora and\r\nfauna, our waters and the air we breathe.\r\nIn this statement I have tried to recall the founding\r\nprinciples that inspire the United Nations, and the great\r\nthemes on which the General Assembly will reflect over\r\nthe coming decades. Clearly, not everything has been\r\nperfect during the past 50 years; there have been\r\nsituations where we Member States have not been\r\neffective enough. Every day, we hear about hunger,\r\ndisease and lack of access to education, which affect the\r\npoor more often than the rich. But now, on this\r\nanniversary, let us take comfort from the work that has\r\nbeen achieved. As I said before, let us consider what the\r\nworld would be without the United Nations.\r\nNone the less, on the eve of the third millennium,\r\nwhen interdependence among the Earth’s peoples is\r\nstronger than ever, we need the United Nations to be\r\nincreasingly nimble and flexible, able to process\r\ninformation quickly and to react rapidly to any crisis.\r\nMany reforms are needed: reform of the Security Council,\r\nnow under debate, and that of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, which may take place in the future, will not be\r\nthe last. We also need more effective methods for\r\nallocating resources and for evaluating the needs of each\r\ndepartment to avoid duplication of labour. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has mentioned this on several occasions, and I\r\nhave no doubt that, given good will, we shall succeed.\r\nThe Principality of Andorra — in the words of our\r\nHead of Government — is a very old nation and a very\r\nyoung State. We are a newcomer to the United\r\nNations — the 184th Member. Nevertheless, it is to the\r\nUnited Nations that we have set up our first diplomatic\r\nmission. Our first Permanent Representative, who during\r\nthe next two years will be in charge of opening our\r\nMission and starting its activities, presented his\r\ncredentials to the Secretary-General just over a week ago.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nWith the humility of a newcomer, but with the joy and\r\nenergy of the convinced, we are making progress in our\r\ntask of participating in the work of the Organization.\r\nI should like, on behalf of the people and Government\r\nof Andorra, to affirm our support for the United Nations.\r\nWe wish it long life and much success in its struggle for\r\ntolerance, peace and development, for the benefit of the\r\nworld and of generations to come. And we express our\r\nhope that humankind will guard those values that will allow\r\nus all to face the challenges of the future — love,\r\nbrotherhood and friendship.\r\nLet me end this statement by quoting Robert Kennedy:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“It is from numberless diverse acts of courage\r\nand belief that human history is shaped. Each time a\r\nman stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot\r\nof others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends\r\nforth a tiny ripple of hope, and, crossing each other\r\nfrom a million different centres of energy and daring,\r\nthose ripples build a current that can sweep down the\r\nmightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain, Sheikh Mohammed\r\nBin Mubarak Al-Khalifa, on whom I call.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset I have pleasure in extending to\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral and to his friendly country,\r\nPortugal, my sincere congratulations on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly for this session, which\r\nmarks the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, when\r\nthe Organization is celebrating its golden jubilee. In\r\nwishing Mr. Freitas do Amaral success in conducting the\r\nproceedings of this session, I assure him of my delegation’s\r\nreadiness to cooperate fully with him towards achieving the\r\ndesired objectives.\r\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy thanks and appreciation to Mr. Freitas do Amaral’s\r\npredecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, for his dedicated and sincere\r\nefforts in guiding the proceedings of the last session.\r\nIt is also a pleasure to express my deep appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ntireless efforts to enhance the international Organization’s\r\nstanding and role and to enable it to carry out its great\r\nresponsibilities and tasks.\r\nThe United Nations was established 50 years ago\r\nwith the purpose of becoming the effective means of\r\nsaving humanity from the scourge of war which had\r\nplagued the century. The Organization was also designed\r\nto serve as a mechanism aimed at developing a new\r\ninternational order based on justice and equality for all\r\nand the promotion of human and cultural interaction\r\namongst the world’s various peoples in the framework of\r\na secure international community.\r\nStates and peoples, in their desire for security,\r\nstability and cooperation, supported the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter, including those which call for\r\nensuring the sovereign equality of and mutual respect\r\nbetween States, refraining from the threat or use of force,\r\nentrenching the principles of settling disputes by peaceful\r\nmeans, respecting every State’s territorial integrity, and\r\nrefraining from interfering in the internal affairs of others.\r\nGuided by these principles, the United Nations has\r\nachieved numerous accomplishments at the political,\r\neconomic and social levels. Many nations and peoples,\r\nwith the support of the United Nations, have been able to\r\nachieve political independence, attain their legitimate\r\nrights and implement development programmes.\r\nThe 50 year experience of the United Nations\r\nembodies profound indications of the future of a changing\r\nworld in which the enormous interacting developments\r\nhave not yet reached the limit. The most prominent\r\namong those signs is, perhaps, the end of the era of\r\nconfrontation between East and West at a time when the\r\nhuman race is on the threshold of a new century. The\r\nprofound significance of these developments is that the\r\nprevailing political climate has given rise to a situation\r\nthat favours the correcting of certain trends in\r\ninternational relations and their development in a manner\r\nthat takes into account the new circumstances and\r\nchanges in several regions of the world.\r\nIn the context of these historical premises, world\r\nPowers have been concerned that changes might lead\r\nthem to proceed in disparate directions which, it was\r\nfeared, would make it difficult for the international\r\ncommunity to check the unrestrained pace of the changes\r\nso engendered and control their effects on world peace\r\nand security. Thus it becomes essential to develop a\r\nbalancing strategy for joint international action, especially\r\nnow that interdependence and multilateralism must form\r\nthe basis of cooperation in international relations.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nThis political reality was given expression on 31\r\nJanuary 1992, when the Security Council — for the first\r\ntime — held a meeting at the level of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment. The Council then requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to prepare a report containing analyses and\r\nrecommendations concerning ways of enhancing and\r\nstrengthening the capabilities of the United Nations in the\r\nareas of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-\r\nkeeping. Recently, on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, the Secretary-General\r\nhas submitted the important “Supplement to An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\u0027”, in which he set out his views and thoughts as\r\na contribution to the continuous drive to enhance the\r\nOrganization’s capability to face up to threats to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe significance of this new tendency was underscored\r\nduring the United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and its Rio\r\nDeclaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21\r\nas well as in many other important international\r\nconventions relating to development and the environment.\r\nIt was further confirmed during the International\r\nConference on Population and Development, held in Cairo\r\nlast year. Both the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nheld in Copenhagen, and the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, held recently in Beijing, confirmed the principle of\r\ninterdependence and recognized its importance.\r\nThese world conferences and meetings have made the\r\nUnited Nations a global forum for the international politics\r\nof multilateralism. Efforts are now being directed towards\r\naddressing the problems of the future, such as\r\nenvironmental pollution and population explosion, in\r\naddition to economic and social crises and other dilemmas\r\nof a universal character.\r\nThis increasing tendency to act in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of interdependence and multilateralism is\r\nundoubtedly a positive one that is in consonance with the\r\npurposes of the Charter. However, certain aspects of the\r\ncurrent international situation raise a number of\r\nfundamental questions concerning the role of the United\r\nNations and its influence on the current developments on\r\nthe international scene which serve as pointers to the shape\r\nof future relations between States.\r\nSuch questioning includes, for example: How will the\r\nOrganization steer a course amid the new features of the\r\nmodern political topography which is changing due to\r\nincessant strategic changes of international policies? How\r\nwill the major Powers identify the role of the United\r\nNations in the area of interdependence and international\r\nmultilateralism? And how will they deal with crises in\r\nareas of high tension around the world?\r\nIt is obvious that such questioning has to do, in\r\nessence, with two fundamental issues. The first is the\r\nfuture of collective security, as envisioned in the Charter,\r\nfor the remaining part of this century and during the next\r\ncentury. The second is the mechanism for international\r\neconomic and social cooperation to which the major\r\nindustrial States will agree.\r\nA search into the legacy of the United Nations\r\nduring half a century leads us to say that these two issues\r\nwill constitute the major characteristics of international\r\nrelations in the twenty-first century. The problem of the\r\nrealpolitik policies pursued by the Powers that influence\r\nthe formulation of international relations is that they do\r\nnot seem to be in harmony with the principle of collective\r\nsecurity. The problem of international economic and\r\nsocial cooperation lies in the fact that the concepts of\r\neconomic and social development held by the wealthy\r\nindustrialized countries are at variance with those of the\r\ndeveloping countries vis-à-vis the economic and social\r\naspects of development issues. In our view, this difference\r\nof outlook creates obstacles that not only impede the\r\nimplementation and development of international\r\ncooperation but also affect the manner in which economic\r\nand social problems are dealt with.\r\nThe two issues of collective security and\r\ninternational economic and social cooperation should be\r\naccorded an increasing importance since they embody the\r\nsolid foundation of stability and progress in a world that\r\nis in a state of flux. The need to attach such importance\r\nto those two issues arises from the fact that, for over 50\r\nyears, the international community has not been able to\r\nreach consensus on how to put into practice the principle\r\nof collective security in line with the vision of the\r\nCharter. In so far as international economic and social\r\ncooperation is concerned, the North-South dialogue has\r\nnot led to any positive result in over three decades.\r\nGiven this fact, the world has to evolve new\r\nperceptions on how to address the issues of collective\r\nsecurity and international economic and social cooperation\r\nin the context of a practical perspective that takes into\r\naccount the new changes that have taken place in the\r\nworld.\r\nIn our view, it is possible, once the international\r\ncommunity musters the necessary political will, to put\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\ninto practice important aspects of the principle of collective\r\nsecurity along the following lines:\r\nThe creation of a mechanism that meets on a regular\r\nbasis within the framework of the Security Council to\r\nmonitor and detect threats to world peace and security.\r\nThe development and better use of the mechanisms of\r\npreventive diplomacy in preventing, containing or\r\npre-empting conflicts before they develop into serious\r\nhostilities.\r\nThe development, in all seriousness, of the ideas and\r\nconcepts embodied in Chapter VII of the Charter, in the\r\nlight of the international community’s experience, to\r\nbecome the basis of dealing with aggression as it arises.\r\nThe utilization of the capabilities of regional\r\norganizations in the context of United Nations cooperation\r\nwith such organizations in the maintenance of world peace\r\nand security.\r\nAs regards international economic and social\r\ncooperation, this too requires the existence of the political\r\nwill, especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized\r\ncountries, to create an equitable global economic\r\nenvironment that may contribute to the achievement of\r\nstability and prosperity for all States and peoples.\r\nWe believe that the gap which exists, in the areas of\r\neconomic growth and social advancement, between the\r\nwealthy industrialized countries, with their enormous\r\neconomic resources, and the developing countries, is among\r\nthe most chronic and significant problems that face the\r\ninternational community.\r\nRegrettably, the commitments to implement the\r\ndevelopment policies and strategies agreed upon in the\r\nUnited Nations with a view to narrowing that gap have not\r\nbeen honoured. It goes without saying that the United\r\nNations will not be able to discharge its mandate in an\r\nenvironment fraught with disparities, because the poverty,\r\nunemployment and lack of productive employment that are\r\nrampant throughout the world are negative factors in the\r\narea of development. Proceeding from its awareness of this\r\nreality, the United Nations has convened the World Summit\r\non Social Development in Copenhagen to address the\r\nurgent and serious issues of social development that face\r\nmankind. We believe that the implementation of the\r\npolicies set out in the Summit’s Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action should take place within the context\r\nof the religious principles, national legislation, customs\r\nand traditions of every State.\r\nIt is essential at this stage to reopen the dialogue\r\nwithin the United Nations system between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries concerning all development matters,\r\non the basis of the commitments set out in the\r\nDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation and\r\nthe International Development Strategy for the Fourth\r\nUnited Nations Development Decade. To that end, a new\r\nand practical development plan has to be adopted with a\r\nview to ensuring compliance with the decisions of the\r\nvarious United Nations development conferences, so that\r\nthe desired objectives of those decisions may be achieved.\r\nWe are convinced that international cooperation\r\ncould be enhanced and strengthened through the adoption\r\nof policies leading to the activation of the United Nations\r\nrole in the area of economic and social cooperation by\r\nmeans of addressing such world problems as development\r\nand environment. Also, world trade mechanisms should\r\nbe developed in accordance with the common interests of\r\nStates and in an equitable manner that takes into account\r\nthe requirements of development and the economic\r\nproblems of the developing countries, accords due\r\nattention to the socio-political aspects of the economic\r\nproblems that beset those countries and aims at\r\nconsolidating the foundations of their economic security.\r\nNotwithstanding its accomplishments, on the one\r\nhand, and, on the other, the obstacles and failures it has\r\nencountered for reasons beyond its control, the United\r\nNations now finds itself facing a new challenge. This new\r\nchallenge forces it to deal with crises and problems\r\ncaused by ethnic, national and even religious and cultural\r\nconflicts and clashes between parties that belonged to\r\nStates and territories which had originally been unified in\r\naccordance with agreements reached in the wake of this\r\ncentury’s wars.\r\nIn view of the tense regional and international\r\natmosphere caused by the eruption of those heretofore\r\ndormant volcanoes and the ensuing changes brought about\r\nby such eruption, it has become essential to enhance the\r\nrole of the United Nations and provide it with the\r\nnecessary means of dealing effectively with such crises\r\nand resolving them before they develop into devastating\r\nwars between the sons of this or that country such as\r\nthose we now witness in Afghanistan, Somalia, the\r\nBalkans and other parts of the world where peoples are\r\nsuffering destruction and destitution.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nIn addition to the new issues that the United Nations\r\nnow faces in the wake of the cold war, there is a host of\r\nregional and international questions that continue to be\r\ncause for concern and require the attention of our\r\nOrganization. Top of the list is the situation in the Gulf\r\nregion which, in the recent past, witnessed two destructive\r\nwars whose consequences continue to affect adversely the\r\nregion’s political and economic conditions and to jeopardize\r\nits security and stability. Proceeding from our eagerness to\r\npreserve security and stability in this vital region of the\r\nworld, we call upon all parties to pay heed to its\r\nimportance as an area where international interests criss-\r\ncross and as an area of strategic importance to world trade.\r\nIn the light of these facts, we stress the need for Iraq\r\nto comply with Security Council resolutions concerning the\r\nState of Kuwait and the release of Kuwaiti and other\r\nprisoners of war and detainees. While we call upon Iraq to\r\nrespond fully to the behests of international legality, we\r\nmust voice our concern over the territorial integrity,\r\nsovereignty and unity of Iraq which must be preserved and\r\nexpress sympathy with the brotherly Iraqi people who\r\nendure difficult economic and social conditions that should\r\nend once their causes cease to exist.\r\nThe persistence of the dispute between the United\r\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran over the\r\nquestion of sovereignty over the islands of Abu Mousa,\r\nGreater Tunb and Lesser Tunb is regrettable in view of its\r\nadverse effects on the Gulf region’s security and stability.\r\nConsequently, Bahrain calls upon the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran to respond to the United Arab Emirates call to seek\r\na solution to the question of the islands through serious\r\nbilateral talks, or by any of the other peaceful means that\r\nare available for the settlement of disputes between States\r\nby mutual consent.\r\nThe Middle East has embarked on a new historical\r\nphase wherein optimism holds sway with the adoption of\r\nthe principle of negotiation and respect for law as a means\r\nto settle disputes between States instead of war, violence\r\nand occupation of territories by force. The peace process in\r\nthe Middle East has taken significant steps since the historic\r\nWashington meeting 13 September 1993, which resulted in\r\nthe signing of the Agreement on Principles between the\r\nPalestinians and Israel. It was followed by the signing of\r\nthe Peace Treaty between Jordan and Israel on 26 October\r\n1994 and the signing of the second phase of the Agreement\r\nof Principles on the expansion of Palestinian self-rule\r\nbetween the Palestinians and Israel in Washington on 28\r\nSeptember 1995. The sparkle of optimism that has glittered\r\non the horizon should not be allowed to die out as a\r\nresult of the Israeli settlement policies that aim at\r\nchanging the demography of the occupied Arab territories,\r\nparticularly Al-Quds, in order to create a new reality.\r\nBahrain welcomes these steps and reaffirms its\r\nsupport for the Middle East peace process. It also\r\nsupports the endeavours and efforts that aim at reaching\r\na just, comprehensive and durable solution based on the\r\nprinciple of land for peace as well as Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Proceeding from\r\nthis, Bahrain reaffirms its support for the position taken\r\nby the Syrian Arab Republic regarding the restoration of\r\nits full sovereignty over its territories in the Syrian Golan\r\nthat has been occupied since 1967. It is also important\r\nthat the peace process should be reactivated on the\r\nLebanese track and that Israel should be compelled to\r\ncomply with Security Council resolution 425 (1978). For\r\nif peace is to prevail, it should include all parties without\r\nexception.\r\nWe appeal to all the parties involved in the dispute\r\nin Somalia to allow the creation of a secure climate that\r\nis conducive to the continuation of political efforts and\r\nhumanitarian activities. Such continuation depends on the\r\ncooperation of those parties and on their adherence to the\r\nprinciple of dialogue and understanding in order to\r\nachieve a political settlement that would ensure the\r\nrestoration of peace, security and stability to this sister\r\nnation.\r\nThe State of Bahrain has, from the beginning,\r\nfollowed with utmost attention and deepest concern the\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with all the\r\nhuman tragedies and injustices resulting from the policies\r\nof aggression and criminal acts, including killings,\r\ndeportations and ethnic cleansing, committed by the Serb\r\naggressors against the people of Bosnia. The crisis has\r\ntaken several turns and twists and has been accompanied\r\nby political moves by regional and international parties\r\nthat have almost deprived the international community of\r\ncredibility.\r\nBahrain has supported all United Nations resolutions\r\nrelating to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has endorsed all\r\nthe efforts and initiatives undertaken by the United\r\nNations, as well as other organizations and all those who\r\ndesire peace and uphold justice.\r\nAs the Serbs have gone too far in their aggression\r\nand in defying the will of the international community in\r\npursuit of their expansionist and aggressive schemes that\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nhave been exposed to all and rejected by all, we see a ray\r\nof light on the horizon which gives cause for hope that, at\r\nlong last, a solution for this human tragedy may be at hand\r\nand might finally redeem the international community’s\r\nsilence over the plight of the Bosnian people.\r\nBahrain supports the positive developments that are\r\ntaking place now in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It calls upon\r\nthe international community and the Security Council to\r\nmaintain pressure on the Serb aggressors towards\r\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions and accepting\r\na just and equitable solution for all parties. In particular,\r\nthe solution should be just and equitable for the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose people have suffered\r\nmaterial losses and have been subjected to inhuman\r\nsuffering as a result of the occupation of parts of their\r\nterritories.\r\nWhile we voice deep concern over the ongoing\r\nconflict in Afghanistan, we should like to call upon the\r\nparties involved in the conflict to resort to reason and logic\r\nand, thereby, reach a cease-fire and work for peace,\r\nstability and national reconciliation.\r\nThe United Nations has deployed continuous efforts\r\nover the past few years towards the settlement of the\r\nCyprus problem. In this connection, we should like to\r\nreiterate our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\nthat aim at reaching a just resolution of the problem in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nBahrain, having supported the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the objectives\r\nthereof,is of the opinion that the Treaty, being an\r\ninstrument of international peace and security, should apply\r\nuniversally with no exceptions or special considerations.\r\nWe should like, meanwhile, to stress the need for upholding\r\nthe Treaty, adherence to its provisions and pursuit of its\r\nobjectives. Bahrain views Security Council resolution 984\r\n(1995), despite the limited nature of the guarantees it\r\nembodies, as a first positive step towards security\r\nguarantees that are applicable to all, for States which do not\r\npossess nuclear weapons.\r\nBahrain supported the initiative of making the Middle\r\nEast a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction on the basis of its belief in the importance of\r\npeace, security and confidence building amongst all States\r\nof the region. It has also endorsed the resolution adopted by\r\nthe conference of the parties to the NPT and the arms\r\nlimitations Treaty, despite its shortcomings. We are\r\nconfident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and\r\nweapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace\r\nprocess and lead to a situation wherein enormous\r\nfinancial resources would be saved and channelled\r\ntowards the economic prosperity and social development\r\nof the peoples of the region.\r\nRegional cooperation has become one of the\r\nnecessities of our modern world in view of the\r\nintertwined interests of the peoples of the world. It is thus\r\na complementary part of, rather than a substitute for\r\ninternational cooperation. It serves today as an effective\r\nmeans for the promotion of economic prosperity and\r\nmutual understanding with a view to establishing strong\r\nrelations based on mutual trust, good-neighbourliness and\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others.\r\nThe Arab Gulf States have long recognized the\r\nimportance of regional cooperation amongst them in\r\nenabling them to face the imminent risks that beset the\r\nregion. More than 15 years ago, they established the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council with a view to reinvigorating Gulf\r\njoint action and strengthening the historical and brotherly\r\nties between the Gulf States on the basis of the unity of\r\nobjectives and a common destiny. The Council’s march\r\nhas witnessed positive developments in the fields of\r\ncoordination and cooperation amongst its member States.\r\nThe resolutions of the fifteenth summit which Bahrain\r\nhad the honour of hosting and presiding over have\r\nstrengthened this march. The summit had historic\r\nsignificance in that it addressed crucial Gulf issues by\r\nadopting resolutions that reaffirmed the determination to\r\nwiden the scope of cooperation, to surmount obstacles and\r\nto settle all outstanding matters within the Council and\r\nthe unified Gulf family. Brotherly and friendly States\r\nhave welcomed these steps and expressed the hope that\r\nthe same spirit would apply to all issues so that all the\r\nStates and peoples of the region may reap the benefits of\r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity.\r\nThe Governments of the States members of the\r\nCouncil have undertaken to continue to promote all\r\naspects of cooperation between their States and with other\r\neconomic groups, to look forward positively to the\r\nprospects of future work and to develop strategic visions\r\nthat take into consideration the interests and priorities of\r\nthe other members of the Council and those of other\r\nStates in the interests of peace, security and stability in\r\nthe region and in the world at large.\r\nThe strengthening of the United Nations role and\r\nincreasing its capabilities and effectiveness require the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\ndeveloping of its bodies, including the Security Council, the\r\norgan concerned with international peace and security. The\r\nneed to develop the work of the Council has become an\r\nimportant issue that has the unanimous support of Member\r\nStates in view of the current international changes. We\r\nbelieve that such development should reflect the equitable\r\ngeographic representation of all regional groups in order to\r\nincrease the effectiveness and level of efficiency of the\r\nOrganization and to achieve balance in the Council, so that\r\nits membership may be representative of the world’s\r\ndifferent cultures. As member of this international\r\nOrganization, Bahrain looks forward to participating in the\r\nwork of the Council during the period of its membership\r\nscheduled for 1998-1999.\r\nWe all aspire after a world of security, cooperation\r\nand peace. Our international Organization, equipped as it is\r\nwith its membership’s intellectual and cultural values and\r\nwith the high principles and noble objectives enshrined in\r\nits Charter, is quite capable of satisfying this aspiration.\r\nHowever, in order for the United Nations to do so, we, its\r\nMembers, must give the Organization our full support on\r\nthe occasion of its fiftieth anniversary so that it may\r\nachieve in our behalf what we all desire, namely, justice\r\nand peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Sri Lanka, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Lakshman Kadirgamar.\r\nMr. Kadirgamar (Sri Lanka): Let me at the outset\r\nextend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal the sincere\r\ngood wishes of the Government and people of Sri Lanka on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nthis its historic fiftieth session. We are privileged to have\r\nhim guide its deliberations. My delegation offers him the\r\nsame full cooperation that we extended to all his\r\npredecessors in that high office.\r\nOur gratitude is due Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nwho presided over the forty-ninth session with great skill\r\nand wisdom.\r\nWhen I addressed the Assembly last year, I reported\r\nthat the people of Sri Lanka had secured an electoral\r\nvictory for\r\n“moderation, tolerance and unity” (Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 5th meeting, p. 23)\r\nin a society that had passed through harrowing times. I\r\ndetailed the initiatives taken by the Government of\r\nPresident Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,\r\nsupported by a number of political parties, including those\r\nof the two principal minority communities, to resolve\r\noutstanding ethnic and other disputes through a bold\r\nprocess of political negotiation. That process was\r\nlaunched, but later encountered set-backs, primarily\r\nbecause one of the groups with which the Government\r\nhad commenced talks abruptly returned to violence and\r\nterrorism, rejecting the peaceful option to which the rest\r\nof the country is committed. The Government has been\r\nconstrained to take unavoidable reactive military measures\r\nto safeguard the lives, the security and the welfare of\r\nthose who are threatened by the terrorist group. So long\r\nas they aim at our leaders the threat of assassination, we\r\ncannot believe that their professions of peace are sincere.\r\nWe continue to fulfil our obligations to all our\r\ncitizens, including those trapped in the north of the\r\ncountry. Supplies of food and other essential requirements\r\nare being made available by the Government and\r\ndelivered through the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross to our citizens in affected areas. This is an\r\nexceptional exercise which the late James Grant of the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) described as\r\nuniquely humanitarian in a conflict situation.\r\nWe are deeply troubled and concerned about the\r\nsituation in which the children of the north and east of\r\nour country are placed. That mankind owes to the child\r\nthe best it has to give is universally accepted. Yet we are\r\nappalled that in their desperation the militants, spurning\r\nthe entreaties of distraught parents, have descended to\r\nconscripting children as young in age as 10 years to wage\r\nwar and have even assigned them to suicide missions. A\r\nrecent military encounter in north-eastern Sri Lanka\r\nrevealed grim evidence confirming our worst fears. Most\r\nof the lives sacrificed by the leadership of the militants\r\nwere teenagers barely able to carry arms, let alone\r\nunderstand the twisted mono-ethnic separatist ideology\r\nthey have been indoctrinated to defend. In truth, it is the\r\nmilitants who must bear the ultimate responsibility for\r\ncivilian casualties in this conflict. One of the challenges\r\nof peace that Sri Lanka will soon have to face is the need\r\nto overcome the terrible legacy of the subverted and\r\ndistorted young minds, of the broken, bereft families and\r\ninterrupted lives that the conflict will leave behind.\r\nAll this has only increased my Government’s\r\ndetermination to fulfil an imperative mandate from the\r\npeople, to rebuild a free society in our Republic which is\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nbased on tolerance and understanding and in which all\r\ncommunities throughout the nation could live in harmony\r\nand dignity in accordance with the principles of democratic\r\ngovernance. The Government has accordingly presented\r\ncomprehensive proposals, daring in their scope and reach,\r\nfor the devolution of power to regional units. True to our\r\nlong-established democratic tradition, a free-ranging\r\nnational debate among Sri Lankans is proceeding on these\r\nproposals. The eventual implementation of agreed proposals\r\nwill require compliance with the procedures appropriate for\r\nthe amendment of our Constitution, including a two-thirds\r\nmajority in Parliament and a national referendum.\r\nTo help further enhance conditions of confidence for\r\nthe observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nmy Government has presented legislation in Parliament to\r\nestablish a Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. The\r\nCommission will consist of members chosen from among\r\npersons with knowledge and experience in the field of\r\nhuman rights. They will be appointed on the\r\nrecommendation of a Constitutional Council — an\r\nindependent and widely representative body reflecting all\r\nshades of political opinion. The proposed Commission will\r\nhave monitoring functions in respect of executive and\r\nadministrative practices as well as investigative functions to\r\ninquire into any infringement of fundamental rights. It will\r\nalso have advisory and other functions, inter alia, to ensure\r\nthat laws and administrative practices accord with\r\ninternational human-rights norms and standards and to\r\nfacilitate inexpensive access to remedial relief. Sri Lanka\r\nhas consistently supported United Nations initiatives for\r\nnational institution-building in the field of human rights.\r\nIt has been a source of major encouragement to us that\r\nthe international community has supported the efforts of the\r\nGovernment of Sri Lanka in the pursuit of peace. While the\r\neventual solution of our problems lies essentially in our\r\nown hands and through mechanisms of our own devising,\r\nwe sincerely appreciate the interest and support of the\r\ninternational community. It is in this context that I have\r\nvolunteered today to brief the Assembly on the situation in\r\nSri Lanka.\r\nThe significance of this session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly extends well beyond the fact that it\r\ncommemorates 50 years in the life of the Organization.\r\nInternational life is in constant flux. No era is wholly static.\r\nYet the last decade or so has seen radical changes affecting\r\nvirtually every aspect of life on this planet. Not all of such\r\nchanges have been welcome. Not all of the changes have\r\nreached their logical, or indeed illogical, conclusion.\r\nThe acclaimed transformation in South Africa has\r\nbeen a blessed exception. Institutionalized racism in its\r\ngrosser forms has at last been vanquished. The South\r\nAfrican experience has demonstrated the power of\r\ntolerance, understanding and inspired leadership to wear\r\ndown the brutal, evil legacies of the past. It has also\r\nshown that there is a capacity for change in human\r\nattitudes once considered unthinkable. Racism, however,\r\nhas continued in subtler forms elsewhere in the world.\r\nThe international community must continue to be vigilant.\r\nThat ugly phenomenon must never be tolerated, wherever\r\nit occurs and whatever its manifestations.\r\nSri Lanka feels deeply that the African continent\r\nneeds the wholehearted and vigorous support of the\r\ninternational community to overcome the obstacles to\r\ndevelopment and growth in this vital region of the world.\r\nThe strengthening and utilization of the capacities and\r\nresources of Africa, identified by the African countries\r\nthemselves and the Economic Commission for Africa, and\r\nconcerted action to implement the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Least-Developed Countries are urgently called for.\r\nThe Middle East is the cradle of three of the world’s\r\ngreat religions. Yet historical prejudices have weighed\r\ndown the quest for peace. Resort to violence and\r\nterrorism, the expropriation of land and the development\r\nof illegal settlements have conspired to impede the\r\nmomentum for peace. Sri Lanka supports the continuation\r\nof the peace process in the Middle East, the realization of\r\nthe inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people\r\nand the establishment of conditions of peace and stability\r\nfor all States in the region which would enable them to\r\ndevelop within secure boundaries. Commitments made on\r\ninterim agreements towards this objective, as Chairman\r\nArafat of Palestine stated last Thursday, must be precise,\r\nhonest and mutual.\r\nIn Bosnia, Sri Lanka welcomes the fact that the\r\nparties concerned have found it possible to commence\r\npeace negotiations although the guns have yet to be\r\nfinally silenced. We feel deeply for, and share the sorrow\r\nof, those who mourn for lives lost, lives disrupted in the\r\naffected communities. We hope that a viable settlement\r\nacceptable to all will soon be concluded. I had occasion\r\nrecently, speaking in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, to\r\ncondemn unreservedly the inhumane and cruel treatment\r\nthat has been inflicted upon the Muslims in Bosnia. These\r\nand other atrocities committed in Bosnia have been fully\r\ndocumented by the United Nations rapporteurs and\r\nhumanitarian agencies and need to be condemned by the\r\ninternational community.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nThe role of the United Nations in that conflict has\r\nreceived special focus as the Organization, in this its fiftieth\r\nyear, undergoes a period of introspection. The situation in\r\nBosnia has been an unusually complex one in which the\r\nUnited Nations has had to deal with developments without\r\nprecedent in the Organization’s peace-keeping history. In\r\nterms of Article 17 of the United Nations Charter, peace-\r\nkeeping is the collective financial responsibility of all\r\nStates. A healthy, albeit controversial, debate has proceeded\r\nin the United Nations on peace-keeping and other related\r\nissues. The debate has made abundantly clear that United\r\nNations intervention or involvement in any situation can\r\nexpect to be successful only if certain basic considerations\r\nare heeded. First, any intervention must enjoy the general\r\nsupport and confidence of the international community and\r\nnot be promoted merely to satisfy the political exigencies\r\nand partisan objectives of members of the Security Council\r\nor other powerful States. Secondly, in any intervention the\r\nconsent of the countries in conflict must be clearly\r\nobtained. Finally, such politico-military operations must\r\nneither dominate United Nations activity nor be its principal\r\nfinancial liability. They must certainly not be carried out to\r\nthe detriment of the pressing development priorities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn “An Agenda for Peace” the Secretary-General has\r\nsought to evaluate manifold aspects of contemporary peace\r\nand security, not merely the question of peace-keeping\r\noperations. This evaluation has had a continuous focus in\r\nthe General Assembly, in the Security Council, in other\r\nforums such as the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as\r\nwell as in national debate since the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitial report was presented in 1992. The cardinal aspect of\r\n“An Agenda for Peace” is the conviction that it is clearly\r\nbetter to prevent conflicts through heeding early warnings\r\nand encouraging quiet diplomacy rather than through\r\nlaunching major politico-military ventures to settle conflicts\r\nafter they have erupted.\r\nWhile economic factors have not always been the\r\ncause of conflict, we very much agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the foundations for peace lie primarily in the\r\nrealm of economic and social development.\r\nThe 1990s have often been described as a period of\r\neconomic globalization, considering the increasing\r\ninterdependence among States, greater international\r\nintegration and flow of goods, services, capital and markets,\r\nas well as a more widespread and rapid dissemination of\r\ninformation and ideas through technological advancements\r\nin communications. Globalization is sometimes over-\r\nsimplified as a phenomenon favourable to the emancipation\r\nof international economic activity. It is true that most\r\neconomies which had been constricted or centrally\r\ncontrolled have now been liberalized and have, as it were,\r\nplugged in to the global economy. Yet, in the process,\r\nmany developing countries have had to make painful\r\nstructural adjustments in their economies at heavy cost to\r\nvulnerable sections of their populations. If there is greater\r\noverall international economic activity, it is also true that\r\nfor many developing countries, despite their best efforts,\r\nthe economic outlook has not been encouraging. The\r\nrecent Conference of non-aligned countries held at Jakarta\r\nissued a renewed call for a new orientation between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries whereby constructive\r\ndialogue and partnership were emphasized, based on a\r\nmutuality of interest and benefit, genuine interdependence\r\nand shared responsibility.\r\nA major thrust of this approach has been to work out\r\nnew practical aspects of international development\r\ncooperation which would embrace developed as well as\r\ndeveloping countries, the more secure economies as well\r\nas those that are more vulnerable. The final communiqué\r\nissued earlier this year in Halifax, at the Summit of the\r\nseven major industrialized countries, proclaimed their\r\nwillingness to cooperate with others to develop a new\r\napproach to international cooperation and to define the\r\nparticular contribution expected of the United Nations\r\nsystem to develop such an approach. A vital aspect of this\r\nexercise should be the enhancement of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations system and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions.\r\nCalls made earlier for a restructuring of international\r\neconomic relations and a North-South dialogue have\r\nfloundered in a sea of slogans. But we must realize that\r\nglobal interdependence has made international cooperation\r\nan imperative, not a slogan. The United Nations must\r\nassert its part in a more effective new multilateralism.\r\nAlmost two decades ago Sri Lanka adopted a liberal\r\nfree-market economy in order to accelerate economic\r\ngrowth. My Government is taking steps to privatize State-\r\ncontrolled enterprises, in particular utilities and services\r\nprovided by the Government, and to encourage foreign\r\ninvestment. We intend to benefit from the opportunities\r\narising from the globalization of economic activity.\r\nA number of world conferences have recently been\r\nheld, covering a series of generic issues which have a\r\ndirect bearing on the lives of people the world over.\r\nThese have demonstrated both the promise and the\r\npaucity of international cooperation. Agenda 21, produced\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nby the Rio Conference on Environment and Development,\r\nis yet to be fully operationalized due to the lack of\r\nnecessary resources. Last year the International Conference\r\non Population and Development affirmed the central role of\r\nthe human being in all development and population\r\nactivities. The World Summit for Social Development, held\r\nin March this year in Copenhagen, sought to promote\r\nconcerted international action to deal with a crucial trio of\r\ncontemporary concerns: poverty, unemployment and the\r\ndisintegration of society. The World Conference on\r\nWomen, in Beijing last month, dealt with a range of\r\nissues — political, social, religious and economic —\r\naffecting women and adopted a Platform for Action to\r\nempower women.\r\nAll these conferences have emphasized that\r\nresponsibility for major global problems needs to be shared\r\nand that action to deal with them needs to be taken in\r\nconcert. Regrettably, if expectations have been great,\r\nresources for their realization have been meagre. The\r\npolitical determination necessary to transform commitments\r\ninto action still appears far less than adequate.\r\nDespite the absence of optimal international\r\ncooperation in certain areas, some regional activities have\r\nmade good progress. In our own region, the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) celebrates\r\nits tenth anniversary this year. The SAARC Preferential\r\nTrade Arrangement has made much headway and is\r\nexpected to enter into force this year. We look to the future\r\nconfident of consolidating our gains in a South Asian free-\r\ntrade arrangement. Sri Lanka, together with our South\r\nAsian partners, will explore all avenues to seek and build\r\non common ground and optimize regional cooperation in\r\nareas of mutual interest. Indeed, cooperation within, as well\r\nas between, regions offers much scope for economic\r\nprogress and equitable sharing of global wealth. We look\r\nforward to greater interregional cooperation to advance this\r\nprocess.\r\nSri Lanka was privileged to have served the Review\r\nand Extension Conference on the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to facilitate\r\nthe adoption of a package of decisions without resort to a\r\nvote. While the outcome of the Conference has been widely\r\nhailed, it is vital also to emphasize the need for the\r\nestablishment of a comprehensive disarmament regime to\r\nmeet the security concerns of all countries, including the\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States, through the realization of\r\ncommitments undertaken under the Treaty and the decisions\r\ntaken at the 1995 Conference by the nuclear-weapon States.\r\nThese commitments include the conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban Treaty, legally binding assurances\r\nto non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of\r\nuse of nuclear weapons, the unimpeded,\r\nnon-discriminatory transfer of nuclear technology for\r\npeaceful purposes and the eventual elimination of all\r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWe have expressed our deep disappointment and\r\nconcern over the resumption of nuclear testing by some\r\nnuclear Powers, which is contrary to the undertakings of\r\nutmost restraint entered into at the NPT Conference. We\r\ntherefore urge that expeditious negotiations be conducted\r\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty, with a view to\r\nconcluding it in 1996. In this regard, we are happy to\r\nsupport President Clinton’s initiative to place the Geneva\r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty on a\r\nfaster track in order to achieve a zero-yield test-ban treaty\r\nby 1996. We also note the recent assurance in this respect\r\ngiven by President Chirac of France.\r\nThe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and\r\nzones of peace is an essential part of regional security.\r\nThe non-aligned countries, including Sri Lanka, have\r\nsought to establish conditions of peace, security and\r\nstability in the Indian Ocean region. The United Nations\r\nAd Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, taking into\r\naccount current realities, has been considering new,\r\nalternative approaches to ensuring peace and security in\r\nthis vital but volatile region of the world. Sri Lanka, as\r\nChairman of the Ad Hoc Committee, has been in\r\nconsultation with those permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council that have not been participating in the\r\nCommittee’s work in order to re-enlist their active\r\nparticipation and give fresh impetus to the process of\r\nstrengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean region,\r\nincluding in respect of non-military aspects of security.\r\nSri Lanka’s initiative for Indian Ocean Marine\r\nAffairs Cooperation (IOMAC) has focused on the\r\ndevelopment of international cooperation in marine affairs\r\nin the economic, scientific and technical fields. The recent\r\nMauritius and Perth initiatives on the Indian Ocean have\r\nrecognized IOMAC’s pioneering effort in helping to\r\nwiden cooperation in the marine sector. The process for\r\nthe formalization of IOMAC through the ratification of\r\nthe 1990 Arusha Agreement on the Organization for\r\nIndian Ocean Marine Affairs Cooperation is being further\r\naccelerated in order to provide an effective mechanism for\r\nintensifying cooperation, in keeping with the growing\r\naspirations of the countries of the region.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has\r\nspawned a variety of studies on the future of the\r\nOrganization, initiated within as well as outside the United\r\nNations. Working groups of the General Assembly have\r\nbeen busy during recent sessions, studying the financial\r\nsituation of the Organization, development issues, the\r\nSecurity Council, the Agenda for Peace and other aspects\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe issues are complex. Progress is slow. Decisions\r\nare few. A resolution on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system, patiently negotiated on the initiative of the\r\nPresident of the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly, was adopted by consensus. There is much to\r\nsupport a coordinated, rational and informed examination of\r\nrecommendations which seek to strengthen the United\r\nNations and render it a more effective and efficient\r\nOrganization. A piecemeal approach may not be an\r\neffective one, given the complexity of the individual issues\r\ninvolved as well as their interrelationship. We look forward\r\nto further work on this initiative next year.\r\nThe Security Council has perhaps been the single most\r\ncontentious United Nations organ under scrutiny. Sri\r\nLanka’s own position is that in many respects the Council\r\nstill reflects power realities that prevailed 50 years ago.\r\nThere can be no warrant for the perpetuation of exclusive\r\nrights without accommodation of other relevant\r\nconsiderations. A substantial increase in the membership of\r\nthe United Nations, particularly from among developing\r\ncounties, needs to be more equitably reflected in the\r\ncomposition of the Council as well. Furthermore, there are\r\nreasons, at least as compelling as those proclaimed 50 years\r\nago to justify the status conferred at that time on the\r\nCouncil’s five permanent members, to now advance the\r\nclaims of other States that aspire to join the five. These\r\nnew aspirants to permanent-member status include,\r\nreasonably and justifiably in our view, non-aligned\r\ncountries as well. Regrettably, eligibility claims for\r\nmembership in the Council continue to be made on\r\nassumptions of power, military or economic, and its global\r\nor regional projection. But this vitiates basic principles\r\nunderlying democratic representation and considerations of\r\njustice and equity. If regional criteria are considered, then,\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America are either unrepresented or\r\nseverely under-represented in the present Council. Finally,\r\nthe veto power, given its untrammelled character and its\r\nassociation with the possession of nuclear weapons, needs,\r\nin our opinion, careful, sober review.\r\nThe Security Council’s methods of work have in the\r\nrecent past been subject to welcome improvement,\r\nparticularly in permitting a better exchange of views\r\nbetween Council members and others. There is, however,\r\nmuch more that needs to be done to make the Security\r\nCouncil truly accessible, democratic and responsive to\r\nMember States of the United Nations, on whose behalf\r\nthe Council is meant to act in accordance with Charter\r\nprinciples. A single example relating to the imposition\r\nand implementation of sanctions would suffice to indicate\r\nthe gap between principle and practice. Situations in\r\nwhich sanctions are imposed vary greatly and no uniform\r\nrules are applicable. Sanctions cannot be applied with\r\nsurgical precision to impact exclusively on those at whom\r\nthey are aimed. Sanctions can thus hurt innocent civilians,\r\naffect entire economies and, as the Council itself\r\nacknowledges, impact adversely on third countries that are\r\nin no way involved in the transgressions of the regime\r\nagainst which sanctions are imposed. Yet decisions by the\r\nCouncil on the imposition of sanctions are not based on\r\nprior consultations with the countries concerned, to assess\r\ncarefully the true impact, extent and reach of such\r\nextreme measures. As sanctions are mandatory, all\r\ncountries are bound to implement them even when they\r\nhave had no part in the decisions leading to them. In his\r\n“Supplement to An Agenda for Peace\u0027”, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has made a number of useful recommendations\r\nrelating to the serious problems encountered in the\r\nimplementation of sanctions. The non-aligned countries\r\nhave studied these proposals and we await further developments.\r\nLater this month, the United Nations will mark its\r\nfiftieth anniversary with a special commemorative\r\nmeeting. Although the occasion will, by its very nature,\r\nembody the highest possible political commitment made\r\nby the international community to the United Nations, it\r\nmust not be seen purely as an opportunity for the\r\nOrganization to garner a harvest of tributes. Much ails the\r\nOrganization. Nevertheless, it is Sri Lanka’s firm\r\nconviction that the membership of the United Nations has\r\nwithin it the means to reinvest in the Organization all it\r\nrequires to fulfil the principles of the Charter. This would\r\nrequire much more than a symbolic declaration of\r\ncommitment by each Member State. We owe it to the\r\npeople we represent to strive diligently in the years to\r\ncome to make this Organization truly a place where the\r\nhighest aspirations of humanity can be fulfilled.\r\nTentative programme of work\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly\r\nto document A/INF/50/5, which contains a tentative\r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings of\r\nthe Assembly for the month of October.
