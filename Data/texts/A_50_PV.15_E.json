(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Lamamra\r\n(Algeria), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (Article 19 of the\r\nCharter) (A/50/444/Add.2)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like to draw the General Assembly’s attention to\r\ndocument A/50/444/Add.2.\r\nIn a letter contained in that document, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs me that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications dated 19 and 22 September 1995, Sierra\r\nLeone has made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears\r\nbelow the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly duly takes note of this\r\ninformation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by the Right Honourable Sir Julius Chan,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Trade of Papua New Guinea\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Assembly will first hear a statement by the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of\r\nPapua New Guinea.\r\nThe Right Honourable Sir Julius Chan, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\nof Papua New Guinea, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI have pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Papua New\r\nGuinea, His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir Julius\r\nChan, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nSir Julius Chan (Papua New Guinea): It is an\r\nhonour for me to address this Assembly on behalf of\r\nPapua New Guinea and in my capacity as the Chairman\r\nof the South Pacific Forum, which met three weeks ago.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral upon his election to preside over the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session, which also marks the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations; and to\r\ncongratulate also his predecessor for the efficiency and\r\nfairness with which he conducted the forty-ninth session.\r\nIn my capacity as the Chairman of the South Pacific\r\nForum and on behalf of Papua New Guinea, I warmly\r\nwelcome the Republic of Palau, a sister country from our\r\nregion, as the 185th Member of the United Nations.\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nAs we mark this fiftieth anniversary, our celebrations\r\nare tempered by the fact that many of the dreams and ideals\r\nof the United Nations remain elusive. A world of greater\r\nfreedom, prosperity and security - the fundamental goals of\r\nthe United Nations Charter - unfortunately has not yet been\r\nattained. Much remains to be achieved by the United\r\nNations, and that, to a great degree, depends on the\r\ncollective support of each and every Member nation.\r\nPapua New Guinea retains a strong belief that the\r\ninternational community cannot do without the United\r\nNations, despite its shortcomings. If it was necessary in the\r\naftermath of the Second World War, it is even more so\r\ntoday. In 50 years, the United Nations has contributed\r\nimmensely to positive international interactions and has\r\nprovided the codes of conduct that today we take for\r\ngranted in our international dealings.\r\nAs one of many countries governed under the watchful\r\neye of the United Nations before becoming a full Member\r\nat independence, Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to\r\nrejuvenating and strengthening the world’s paramount\r\ninternational Organization.\r\nEverything that needs to be said for the good of\r\nhumanity has been said many times over in this very Hall.\r\nNoble and practical sentiments have always been expressed,\r\noften in the strongest terms. What too often have been\r\nlacking are political will and international statesmanship.\r\nTherein lies the difference between wishful thinking and\r\nturning our hopes and dreams for humanity into reality.\r\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, I am proud to say that Papua New Guinea\r\npledges full commitment to the principles and objectives of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nWe should together strive to build a better world for\r\nthis generation and for those to come, in the next 50 years\r\nand beyond. In areas where the United Nations has been\r\nsuccessful, we have to recommit ourselves, and where it\r\nhas not been successful, now is the time to correct and\r\nrebuild inadequate systems. Our ultimate objective must be\r\nto promote a more effective, more accountable, more\r\nresponsible and more caring United Nations, capable of\r\nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe must consider very carefully how we should usher\r\nin and embrace the twenty-first century. The end of one\r\ncentury and the beginning of another provides us with a\r\nnatural period of reflection and self-examination. It is time\r\nto resolve to untangle, and rid ourselves of, all that has\r\nstopped us from creating a better world.\r\nFor that reform, we require a fresh start with greater\r\ndetermination, less cynicism, and hearts open more widely\r\nto the plight of all humanity. That is our collective\r\nchallenge between now and the year 2000. The\r\ninternational community must demonstrate the necessary\r\nresolve, courage, vision and moral will to make this world\r\na better place.\r\nIn setting the agenda for a better future, we must\r\nfirst understand our shared history. We must know that\r\nwithin the United Nations, our collective search for true\r\npeace is deeply rooted in events that took place just\r\nmonths before this Organization came into existence.\r\nI speak of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and\r\nNagasaki. They did not just change our world forever —\r\nthese events changed the very way we think. Effectively\r\nthe closing acts of the Second World War, they forced\r\nupon the world an urgency in the search for peace. It is\r\nan urgency that has never been lost, as morality and the\r\nheart of man battle to keep pace with technology in all its\r\nforms.\r\nIt is a race that the United Nations is running. It is\r\na race that it cannot afford to lose.\r\nIf peace is in the hearts of men, and men in turn are\r\nthe heart of nations, and nations the heart of the world,\r\nthen we must fully realize just how profound a change we\r\nmust undergo to find true peace. The extent to which the\r\nworld discovers and embraces peace will be reflected in\r\nthe way it faces up to other threats to humanity.\r\nOne of the challenges that I believe is eating away\r\nat the health and lives of all nations is the abuse of\r\ndrugs — and it truly is a world problem.\r\nThe drug trade preys upon the youth of the world,\r\nshattering the lives of individuals and the peace and\r\nprosperity of communities. It has truly established its own\r\nfoul “united nations”.\r\nThe criminals — and they are criminals of the\r\nlowest order — have broken down barriers of nationality,\r\npolitics, race, religion and culture far more successfully\r\nthan has this Assembly, as they ply their evil trade.\r\nThe networks they have established make\r\nmultinational corporate giants look like small players, and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nhave become so entrenched that they can be met only with\r\nan equally determined and broad-based international\r\nresponse.\r\nThat task must be placed at the door of the United\r\nNations because, quite simply, no other group, no nation,\r\ncan take them on alone.\r\nVictory in the battle against the drug barons will\r\nrequire the same qualities needed in every other serious\r\nendeavour of the United Nations — political will and\r\ncollective determination. Without these factors, we risk\r\nlosing generations to destructive substance abuse. The price\r\nis too high. We must fight as one against this evil.\r\nIt is battles such as this that collectively we must take\r\nup. If we do not commit ourselves to fights for decency\r\nsuch as this one, we will never find the courage required to\r\nattain true life and peace in this world.\r\nOn the question of the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil membership, we urge the five permanent members\r\nof the Council to join us in looking critically at the\r\ncontinuing relevance of their privileged positions and to\r\nconsider how the Security Council might operate more\r\neffectively.\r\nPapua New Guinea fully supports the permanent\r\nmembership of Japan and Germany on the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe are also aware of the need to support shared\r\nobjectives and decisions with adequate resources. We are\r\nespecially concerned that the ongoing financial difficulties\r\nshould be resolved promptly, so that the United Nations can\r\nfunction to its full capacity.\r\nNo one should rest satisfied while we are faced with\r\nthe perpetuation of social and economic disparities between\r\nand within nations — largely the result of parochial\r\ninterests being pursued at the expense of genuine human\r\nconcerns.\r\nIt is precisely this short-sightedness that has resulted\r\nin United Nations failure in some areas in the past.\r\nDecency and justice must prevail in fact, and not just\r\nin words.\r\nPapua New Guinea, as an active participant in and\r\nbeneficiary of the Lome Convention between the European\r\nUnion (EU) and the African Caribbean Pacific Group of\r\nStates (ACP), is greatly honoured to currently hold the\r\npresidency and the chairmanship of all Lome Convention\r\ninstitutions, including the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the\r\nACP Council of Ministers and the ACP Committee of\r\nAmbassadors.\r\nWe feel confident that we will play a substantive\r\nrole, under the Lome Convention, in addressing these\r\ninequities. We are also hopeful that the international trade\r\nand economic situation will improve with the advent of\r\nthe World Trade Organization, with protections to ensure\r\nthat the weak are not manipulated by the strong.\r\nThe problems of debt management and servicing\r\ncontinue to plague many developing countries. In trying\r\nto address them, we do not believe there are universal\r\nsolutions. Every case must be dealt with individually and\r\non its own merits. To do otherwise will simply cause\r\nserious social and political dislocation.\r\nIn this regard, international lending institutions such\r\nas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) should demonstrate the requisite sensitivity and\r\ntact. We do not believe there is a single recipe for all\r\nproblems, particularly as they relate to structural\r\nadjustment programmes of the type which we in Papua\r\nNew Guinea have only recently ploughed through and\r\nadopted, after refinements to meet our own particular\r\ncircumstances.\r\nWe live in a rapidly changing world, and it is a\r\nworld dogged by confusion and distortion as it struggles\r\nto set new bounds of acceptability and compatibility.\r\nWith the decline of the cold war, our optimistic\r\nhearts thought we might at long last enter a period of\r\npeace, security and prosperity. Much of that optimism has\r\ntoday given way to doubt and concern.\r\nThe challenge to the resolve and the resources of the\r\nUnited Nations is arguably as great as it has ever been —\r\nin Bosnia, the former Soviet Union, Rwanda, Somalia and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nSome of these trouble-spots have highlighted the\r\nUnited Nations problems and been a source of acute\r\nembarrassment to the United Nations, which has too often\r\nbeen reduced to shameful impotence. The tragedy — the\r\noverwhelming tragedy — of this is that lives have been\r\nlost; people have died in huge numbers. The simple fact\r\nis that so many of them would still be alive today if the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nUnited Nations had more effectively fulfilled its role once\r\nit had decided to intervene.\r\nWhen we lay this accusation at the door of the United\r\nNations, let us make no mistake about it: we do not and\r\ncannot distance ourselves from these failings. We, the\r\nmembers, are the United Nations. We are responsible for\r\nwhat it does, or fails to do. We must lay much blame at the\r\ndoor of the Member States which, collectively, have so\r\nlacked political will and moral courage.\r\nThe reforms that will bring about increased political\r\nwill and a more humanitarian view must occur within each\r\nand every Member nation. As the United Nations celebrates\r\nits fiftieth anniversary, we would like to stress that if it\r\nwants to be a true world forum, then it should exclude no\r\ncountry, large or small.\r\nAt a time when reconciliation is superseding\r\nconfrontation the United Nations, in accordance with the\r\nspirit of preventive diplomacy, should do its best to ease\r\nthe tensions between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Peace\r\nand prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region are at stake.\r\nOn a global scale, we thought there was a hope for\r\npeace and prosperity on the horizon when the international\r\ncommunity gathered in Rio for the Earth Summit on\r\nEnvironment and Sustainable Development.\r\nWe all pledged and acknowledged at the Rio Summit\r\nthat something had to be done, because humanity was\r\nendangered by environmental degradation and climate\r\nchange, and we adopted “Agenda 21” as the framework\r\ndocument.\r\nAll Governments took the document firmly in hand,\r\nbut sadly their grip today appears to have slackened.\r\nThis experience and others call into question the\r\nusefulness of further global conferences, when the results\r\nof the ones already held are so generally disappointing.\r\nWe have had all the special world conferences, such\r\nas the ones in Barbados on small island developing States,\r\nin Cairo on population, in Copenhagen on social issues, in\r\nBerlin on climate change and the recent Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, held in Beijing — although in\r\nfairness to the latter, we should give it more time to\r\nproduce results. We should consider a moratorium on such\r\ngatherings until we begin to see practical benefits coming\r\nthrough. The talking has been done; it is now time for\r\naction.\r\nEnvironmental issues have become an all-\r\nencompassing international agenda. In the context of an\r\ninterdependent world, we have a collective responsibility\r\nguided by the framework of international conventions to\r\nmanage and develop our resources sustainably. The goals\r\nof sustainable development can be realized only through\r\neffective intergovernmental cooperation and through\r\nregional and international efforts.\r\nFor its part, the South Pacific Forum, made up of 16\r\nnations, including Palau, which joined at the most recent\r\nForum, has adopted both national and regional strategies\r\nto develop and implement environmentally sound\r\nprogrammes. Together with our fellow members of the\r\nMelanesian Spearhead Group, we have become party to\r\nthe Lakatoro Declaration on Oceania Cooperation on\r\nDenuclearization.\r\nPapua New Guinea and the other 15 members of the\r\nSouth Pacific Forum recently expressed extreme outrage\r\nat the French Government’s resumption of nuclear testing\r\nat Mururoa and resolved to review the status of their\r\ndialogue with France. In total disregard of our stand,\r\nFrance detonated its second nuclear test, at Fangataufa\r\nAtoll, at 9.30 a.m., Papua New Guinea time, on Monday,\r\n2 October 1995. Consistent with the resolution of the\r\nSouth Pacific Forum nations, I now, regrettably, in my\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Forum, announce the\r\nsuspension forthwith of all post-Forum dialogue with\r\nFrance.\r\nI am pleased to report that the twenty-sixth South\r\nPacific Forum paid close attention to the changed regional\r\nand world security situation. The Forum’s concept paper\r\n“Securing Development Beyond 2000” looked at security\r\nissues well beyond the scope of military threats and\r\nmilitary solutions. We focused on increasing security on\r\na sustainable basis by promoting trade, transport and\r\ntourism in and for our region. We addressed the need for\r\nregional arrangements on environmental damage, natural\r\ndisasters and other emergencies; as a result, we are\r\nworking to have a comprehensive and detailed plan of\r\naction for the region.\r\nThat is a Forum document to which we are party;\r\nbut for Papua New Guinea’s part, we have our own\r\nnational guiding document, “The Pacific Plan”, for our\r\nrelations with our Pacific neighbours.\r\nIn considering Pacific issues, the Forum was\r\nconscious that small island States are very vulnerable and\r\nhave unusual needs. Their economies are constantly under\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nthreat from natural disasters such as cyclones, volcanoes\r\nand the looming danger of rising sea levels. When such\r\nStates are hit by cyclones, it is akin to the ravages of war,\r\nand their economies and infrastructures face severe strains\r\nthat seriously hamper and set back their development.\r\nPapua New Guinea therefore appeals to the international\r\ncommunity to render support consistent with the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States to assist their efforts to\r\nachieve greater self-reliance.\r\nSmall nations, including many in the Pacific, have\r\nsuffered from declining international concern since the end\r\nof the cold war. Geo-economic considerations have largely\r\nreplaced the geo-political considerations of the past, with\r\nnew webs of alignment replacing the old and familiar ones.\r\nThis has forced regionalistic tendencies upon nations, which\r\nin some respects has crippled moves towards a true global\r\npartnership.\r\nMember nations will be aware of the internal crisis\r\nthat Papua New Guinea has faced on Bougainville, one that\r\nhas demanded enormous energy, time, patience and\r\nresources from the Government of my country. I am\r\npleased to inform the Assembly that my Government, since\r\ntaking office in August of last year, has wholeheartedly\r\nsought a successful resolution to the Bougainville situation,\r\nso far with notable success. Please allow me to express the\r\nappreciation of the people and the Government of Papua\r\nNew Guinea to the United Nations, and to the\r\nSecretary-General’s office in particular, for the cooperation\r\nand understanding extended to us throughout this process.\r\nI am thinking particularly of the support the United Nations\r\noffered to the Bougainville Peace Conference of October\r\nlast year, which, I am pleased to say, with the coming\r\ntogether of the South Pacific peace-keeping force, put flesh\r\non the words of the Secretary-General on the value of\r\nregional approaches to conflict resolution. I believe that\r\ntoday the benefits of that wise policy are there for all to see\r\nin the situation on Bougainville, which has vastly improved\r\nover the past 12 months.\r\nWe also wish to assure the international community of\r\nour absolute commitment to human rights in dealing with\r\nthis situation, as guaranteed in our Constitution. Indeed, it\r\nis a fundamental regard for the right of all our people to\r\nlive free and peaceful lives that has driven me and my\r\nGovernment to search tirelessly for a resolution to this\r\ncrisis.\r\nThere is no such thing as a minority group in Papua\r\nNew Guinea because we come from numerous and diverse\r\nlinguistic, cultural and social backgrounds. We have over\r\n800 tribes and languages among 4 million people, in a\r\ncountry the size of Malaysia. In effect, we are all\r\nminorities in our land. As such, every group has a\r\nlegitimate place in Papua New Guinea.\r\nFor us and for other developing nations, the focus of\r\nsocial issues falls squarely on the question of empowering\r\npeople to eradicate poverty, get an education and live\r\nhealthy lives. When that is achieved, the people are then\r\nin a position to expand their participation in the social\r\nand economic development of their nation. Without those\r\nbasics, theirs is simply a battle for survival.\r\nIncreasing marginalization of the poor and of\r\nminorities remains a major problem within every country,\r\nregardless of economic or political status. We support the\r\nview that a new paradigm of development has to redefine\r\nthe needs of people in terms of securing the basics of life\r\nsuch as housing, food and water. This can be achieved\r\nonly by empowering people through decision-making and\r\nthrough direct participation in the development process.\r\nIn that connection, I wish to draw the attention of\r\nthe Assembly to a report to be prepared by the\r\nSecretary-General on the United Nations initiative on\r\nopportunity and participation, which I hope will receive\r\nthe serious consideration it deserves.\r\nOne of the hallmarks of United Nations achievement\r\nhas been the decolonization of peoples under colonial\r\ndomination. As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, we can proudly testify that the\r\nUnited Nations has generally fulfilled its duties and\r\nresponsibilities with respect to the decolonization process.\r\nMy country and many others represented in this Hall are\r\ntestimony to the honourable achievements of this\r\nOrganization in decolonization. Less than three weeks ago\r\nmy people joyfully celebrated the twentieth anniversary of\r\nthe independence of Papua New Guinea.\r\nWhile we acknowledge and commend the United\r\nNations for its decolonization achievements, its task is not\r\nyet complete. There are still many Territories under\r\ncolonial domination of one form or another. In\r\nrecognition of the unfinished task relating to colonialism,\r\nthe General Assembly has adopted a resolution\r\nproclaiming the International Decade for the Eradication\r\nof Colonialism. This carries great hope for those who are\r\nstill under the yoke of colonialism.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nThe end of apartheid in South Africa brought a great\r\nsense of relief and enlightenment, not just there but\r\nthroughout the world. In that vein, colonialism — another\r\nblight on humanity — should be done away with and\r\nconsigned to the pages of history as a degrading\r\nphenomenon of a bygone age.\r\nThere is a need to take a case-by-case approach in\r\naddressing the problems of the Territories under colonial\r\nadministration to ensure that the wishes of the people\r\nconcerned are adequately and realistically taken into\r\naccount in determining their eventual political status.\r\nIn our immediate region, we are keen to see the\r\ndecolonization process in New Caledonia allowed to take its\r\ndue course, consistent with United Nations principles and\r\npractices. While we acknowledge the progressive attitude\r\ntaken by the French Government with regard to New\r\nCaledonia, we are concerned that certain negative and\r\ncounter-productive policies still exist. In that regard, we call\r\non France to fulfil its decolonization responsibilities quickly\r\nand with dignity.\r\nThe eradication of colonialism before the year 2000\r\nwill place us on a more enlightened plateau. It will make\r\nthe world a better place, more equipped to take on the\r\nchallenges of the future with justice and dignity for all.\r\nThe United Nations undoubtedly stands for humanity.\r\nIt provides the best possible avenue to peace, security and\r\nprosperity. While we all acknowledge the worthy objectives\r\nof the United Nations Charter, no country can claim that it\r\nhas given full and complete support to the Organization.\r\nUnfortunately, the United Nations has time and again\r\nbeen used for parochial pursuits, whether in respect of\r\npeace-keeping, human rights or environmental areas or in\r\nSecurity Council deliberations. In this very imperfect world,\r\nit would be naive to have ever expected perfect solutions\r\nfrom the United Nations. I say again that it is, however, an\r\nOrganization that my Government strongly believes the\r\ninternational community cannot do without. If the United\r\nNations did not exist, we would have to invent it. Fifty\r\nyears on, our task is to reinvent it, to make it better, to\r\nallow it to fully and ably serve humanity. This is a most\r\nnoble goal that must be pursued with pragmatic intensity\r\nand determination.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is the\r\ntime for each and every Member nation to recommit itself\r\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter. We must do it for peace, and with the vivid\r\nrecollection of Hiroshima and Nagasaki never far way. If\r\nwe are to welcome the new century as we should, then\r\nthe United Nations Charter provides the yardstick for the\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\nThere are many global issues confronting us today,\r\nand the United Nations provides us with the best\r\nchance — the only chance — of handling them\r\nsuccessfully. So let us act for the sake of all humanity. In\r\nthis global age we must mend our ways. We must think\r\nwith global heads and attend to humanity’s needs with\r\nglobal hearts. Only then will our attitudes have kept pace\r\nwith the realities we face. Only then can we leave a better\r\nworld for our children.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nTrade of Papua New Guinea for the important statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nThe Right Honourable Sir Julius Chan, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade\r\nof Papua New Guinea, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister of State, Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Senegal and Senegalese Living\r\nAbroad, His Excellency Mr. Moustapha Niasse, on whom\r\nI call.\r\nMr. Niasse (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nMy country, Senegal, is very pleased to express to Mr.\r\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral its warm congratulations on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfiftieth session. His election reflects how much the\r\ninternational community values the role his country —\r\nPortugal — has played in analysing and managing the\r\nmajor questions that mark the evolution of the world. It\r\nalso values his personal qualities as a diplomat and a\r\nstatesman, as well as his experience in the field of human\r\nrelations, the fundamental basis of peace among nations.\r\nI should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Freitas do\r\nAmaral’s predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister\r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, who conducted the work for the year of\r\nthe forty-ninth session with effectiveness and remarkable\r\nopen-mindedness, thus earning the pride of all Africa.\r\nFinally, I should like here, once again, to emphasize\r\nmy country’s support for the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali. His initiatives, his repeated actions\r\nand his determination to accomplish his noble mission in\r\nthe service of peace, security and development, despite a\r\nparticularly unstable international situation, have earned the\r\ngratitude of the world. History will owe him a debt of\r\nthanks.\r\nToday, the United Nations has travelled through half\r\na century. For 50 years the peoples of the Earth, following\r\nthe Second World War, having wisely learned the lessons\r\nof the mistakes and set-backs of the history of human\r\nconflicts, have been engaged in an effort to create a new\r\nenvironment, an atmosphere of mutual understanding and\r\nof cooperation in solidarity, a framework within which\r\nmankind can finally realize that communal spirit, generosity\r\nand mutual respect are the best possible guarantees of\r\npeace, well-being, health and the environment, as well as\r\nthe blossoming of society.\r\nFor 50 years, pursuant to the principles set forth in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter by the founders of our shared\r\nOrganization, we have, stage by stage, laid the foundations\r\nfor an international system that can provide collective\r\nsecurity for all countries and, at the same time, create the\r\nbest possible conditions for life in greater freedom.\r\nIf we consider the action that the Organization has\r\nundertaken since its creation — in particular, if we analyse\r\nthe management of the many conflicts that arose here and\r\nthere during the period of the cold war — we can see,\r\nwithout any shadow of doubt, that it has indeed proved to\r\nbe an irreplaceable tool for the promotion and maintenance\r\nof peace.\r\nIndeed, beyond the simple maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the Organization\r\nremarkably distinguished itself in the struggle for\r\ndecolonization, but, above all, in the establishment of a\r\nprogressive system of specialized agencies, all of which\r\nprovide highly valued assistance in the social, economic,\r\nhumanitarian and cultural fields.\r\nBut, despite these recorded achievements, we have to\r\nadmit that there is still a long road to travel, that a number\r\nof important challenges still have to be met, and new and\r\nbold initiatives taken, if we are to realize fully the ideals\r\ncontained in the San Francisco Charter.\r\nPatient preparation is being made for a historic reform\r\nof the structures of the Organization itself and, specifically,\r\nthe Security Council. In this connection, Senegal\r\nunreservedly supports an increase in the numbers of\r\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Council\r\nwith a view to strengthening the conditions and\r\nmachinery available for the maintenance of peace.\r\nIt must indeed be accepted that the end of\r\nideological confrontation has brought the world neither\r\nthe peace nor the development that was so earnestly\r\nanticipated by the founding fathers of the Charter.\r\nFrom Afghanistan to Angola, from Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to Somalia, from Liberia to the republics\r\nthat emerged from the former Soviet Union, many\r\nconflicts continue to this day to resist our attempts to\r\nsolve them. True, for some conflicts, such as those in\r\nAngola or the Middle East, significant progress has\r\nrecently been achieved. And I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to welcome the new important step that has\r\njust been taken in the search for a settlement to the\r\nMiddle East conflict with the signing, on 28 September in\r\nWashington, of the Taba Agreement.\r\nIn the case of other conflicts, such as that in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, a glimmer of hope is now showing over\r\nthe horizon thanks to the concerted action of the Western\r\nContact Group and the Contact Group of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference, as well as the European Union,\r\nthe United States of America, the Russian Federation and\r\nother Governments of good will. This is also an\r\nopportunity for me to congratulate the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and its member States for all their\r\nefforts and initiatives. They have made a considerable\r\ncontribution to the results we have solemnly welcomed\r\ntoday.\r\nIn this regard, it is clear that the heroic struggle of\r\nthe Bosnian people, underpinned by its leaders’ acute\r\nawareness of their responsibilities, has made a powerful\r\ncontribution to the new situation which the international\r\ncommunity wishes to see strengthened and eventually\r\nresult in a definitive peace for the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe proliferation of conflicts resulting from the\r\ndisappearance of blocs has had the positive effect of\r\nlaying the foundation for a consensus on the machinery,\r\ncriteria, conditions and means to be used to ensure,\r\norganize and safeguard peace throughout the world. This\r\nconsensus implies that we must have greater recourse to\r\npreventive diplomacy as an innovative concept to ensure\r\nthat our system of collective security functions properly.\r\nThis consensus also implies that the mandates of peace-\r\nkeeping operations should henceforth be better defined in\r\nthe light of the circumstances and objectives sought. The\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nnecessary means should therefore be collected and\r\nmobilized.\r\nThe importance which my country, Senegal, attaches\r\nto this question is commensurate with its tireless\r\ndetermination to work towards an effective security system\r\nthat works because it is fully adapted to current realities. It\r\nis above all in this spirit that Senegal is a regular\r\nparticipant in the work of the Special Committee to review\r\nthe whole question of peace-keeping operations in all their\r\naspects.\r\nMoreover, Senegal’s position is in accord with the\r\nclear awareness in Africa of changes occurring throughout\r\nthe world and which led our continent in 1992, at the\r\nsummit meeting of the Organization of African Unity in\r\nDakar, to conceive and establish a mechanism for the\r\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts. This\r\nAfrican initiative, which contributes to the maintenance of\r\npeace and security throughout the world, should therefore\r\nbe supported by the international community in order to\r\nreduce the practical ramifications of the lack of funds\r\nwhich, as everyone knows, is so sorely afflicting Africa,\r\nand enable it to achieve its legitimate ambitions through\r\nfulfilment of the aims of this machinery. With such support,\r\nour continent, Africa, would be able to devote itself further\r\nto settling the conflicts in Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra\r\nLeone and Somalia.\r\nSpeaking of regional conflicts, in regard to the\r\nproblem of Jammu and Kashmir — involving two\r\nneighbouring and fraternal countries, India and Pakistan,\r\nwith which Senegal has friendly relations — my delegation\r\nwould urge a definitive settlement that would allow these\r\ntwo great Asian nations to devote their efforts to\r\nestablishing an atmosphere of peace conducive to integrated\r\ndevelopment and mutual benefit. The Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, in conjunction with these two\r\ncountries, is giving careful thought to this matter.\r\nIt is universally recognized today that there can be no\r\ndevelopment without peace and stability. It is thus in the\r\nlack of development, poverty, marginalization and exclusion\r\nthat we must seek the underlying causes of insecurity. We\r\nmust therefore devise together a new system of collective\r\nlife that will give everyone new reasons for hope on the\r\nbasis of the spirit of solidarity and desire for peace in\r\nwhich the system is founded.\r\nSuch action should begin with a new awareness that,\r\neven if the expression “globalization of the economy” is\r\nnow in vogue, the phenomenon goes far beyond the trend.\r\nIndeed, it involves, coevally, economics, finance and\r\ninformation. It is also and particularly relevant to the\r\nmajor problems of humanity’s future, be it the question of\r\nprotecting the environment, fighting threats against our\r\ncollective health, drug trafficking or fighting organized\r\ncrime. It has become obvious today that the solutions to\r\nthese problems cannot but be global.\r\nIn the light of these new realities of today’s world,\r\nit is clear that only a new conception of collective\r\nsolidarity will allow us to avoid or at least mitigate the\r\nmany serious consequences of poverty and exclusion that\r\nare so damaging to everyone. We must therefore make a\r\ncollective commitment to defining a new social covenant\r\nfor the future of mankind. The struggle against poverty in\r\nthe countries of the southern hemisphere therefore\r\nassumes particular importance in this context.\r\nGiven the current globalization and liberalization in\r\nthe economy of nations, the new World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) — opened in Geneva a few months\r\nago after having been christened at the historic Marrakesh\r\nmeeting — should prove to be a new framework and\r\ncradle for a world open to fairer, more balanced and more\r\nhuman economic and trade relations between the countries\r\nof the North and South, in the spirit of the legitimate\r\nclaims of the peoples of the third world. Here, I wish\r\nsolemnly to reaffirm that the WTO carries with it the\r\nhopes of the world for a new era of profitable, balanced\r\nand sustainable trade for all.\r\nFrom this perspective, the World Trade\r\nOrganization, to the establishment of which the African\r\ncountries contributed, should help those countries to\r\nparticipate more actively in the new international\r\neconomic system.\r\nMoreover, the globalization and liberalization of the\r\neconomy should also encourage the developing countries\r\nto intensify South-South cooperation as an essential\r\ncomponent of both the strategy for development and the\r\nmeans to ensure the integration of their economies in the\r\nnew context and within the new aspirations of the\r\ninternational community for development in peace,\r\nparticularly of the countries of the South. The same is\r\ntrue of the need to boost commodity prices and to ensure\r\nequitable access to markets — to all markets — to allow\r\nour countries to develop genuine and effective trade\r\npolicies. My country, Senegal, wishes unreservedly to\r\nstake its claim to this dynamic process.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nOn the occasion of this fiftieth anniversary of the\r\ncreation of the United Nations, from this rostrum I wish to\r\nmake a solemn and heartfelt appeal on behalf of the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. This appeal reflects a major concern\r\nof African leaders and peoples. The United Nations, as we\r\nknow, has devoted much fruitful attention to this matter, as\r\nwitnessed by the convening in Geneva last July, within the\r\nframework of the session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, of a high-level debate on African development.\r\nToday, it is a truism to stress the dangers of Africa’s\r\nmarginalization. It is a danger, a real one, painful and\r\nserious. Although it is real, the danger is none the less\r\nunacceptable. It is therefore absolutely essential, for all\r\nthose for whom solidarity and international cooperation\r\ncontinue to hold meaning, that it be averted.\r\nI welcome the fact that the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization that shelters us today is one of those who\r\nbelieves that there is no historical inevitability which Africa\r\ncannot overcome. Has not Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\r\ndecisively proved this by deciding to launch a special\r\ninitiative for Africa, with the clear aim of breathing fresh\r\nlife into international cooperation?\r\nThrough me, Senegal reiterates its total support for\r\nthis initiative, which is particularly fortunate since it\r\ndovetails with all the priorities Africa has set for itself —\r\nnamely, food security, water control, social and human\r\ndevelopment, democracy, mobilization of resources and,\r\nfinally the struggle against poverty.\r\nIt should also be recalled that the Head of the\r\nSenegalese State, His Excellency President Abdou Diouf,\r\nhas been tirelessly devoting himself for a long time now to\r\nseeking global solutions to the problems of Africa,\r\nparticularly the excruciating question of debt which is\r\ndelaying the development of African countries.\r\nThus, during his first term of office as Chairman of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, he was the initiation of\r\nthe convening in 1986, for the first time in the annals of the\r\nUnited Nations, of a special session of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to Africa’s critical economic situation.\r\nSimilarly, Senegal welcomed the conclusion in Paris\r\nin 1994 of the international Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa, and\r\nwould like to stress here that this Convention must be put\r\ninto effect very soon and that the allocation of the\r\nconsiderable resource that would be needed to uproot this\r\nscourge from the African continent should be accelerated.\r\nThis is the task which for years now has been the special\r\nconcern of the Interstate Committee for Drought Control\r\nin the Sahara.\r\nWe cannot speak about development without\r\naddressing the question of respect for and protection of,\r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, which have\r\ntoday become a universally recognized requirement.\r\nEveryone is aware of how wedded Senegal is to this\r\nrequirement of our modern times that, in view of the\r\nchanges which have affected the world since the end of\r\nthe 1980s, all African countries, integrate this policy into\r\ntheir development policy as an unavoidable dimension of\r\nprogress.\r\nTo conclude, may I emphasize once again that the\r\nnew international context and the multi-dimensional\r\nnature of the problems that must be solved require\r\nconcerted action by all of us: integrated action, solidarity\r\namong all partners — Governments, agencies and bodies,\r\npublic or private — that mould the life and the evolution\r\nof the human international community.\r\nSolidarity is the cement and also the guarantee of\r\nthis common approach, which is inspired by what is\r\nneeded for mankind to survive. Solidarity is first and\r\nforemost a profound conviction that we all belong to one\r\nand the same world, whether it be developed or\r\nunderdeveloped. Solidarity also entails a duty to face up\r\nto our common problems and our common challenges,\r\nwhether we come from the North or from the South.\r\nSolidarity is, finally, a collective will to build the future\r\non the basis of a partnership from which none are\r\nexcluded. Solidarity is also a common commitment\r\nvoluntarily to promote the collective progress of all\r\nmankind. It is in the name of all the nations that are so\r\ngreatly devoted to the mission of man on earth that we\r\nmust nurture solidarity, cooperation, friendship and\r\nbrotherhood.\r\nIn this spirit and at this juncture in the history of our\r\nplanet when hope has been rekindled by the celebration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of an organization — the\r\nUnited Nations — without which the world would not be\r\nwhat it is today, we solemnly express our ardent hope\r\nthat this 1995 session, the fiftieth in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations, will be the dawn of a new era in which\r\nwe shall witness the realization of all our ideals of peace,\r\njustice and progress, to the greatest benefit of future\r\ngenerations, to which it is our duty to hand over a world\r\nof peace, a world of security and a world of development.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Foreign Minister of Australia, His\r\nExcellency Senator Gareth Evans.\r\nMr. Evans (Australia): I congratulate Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. His election is a tribute\r\nboth to him and to Portugal, and Australia will work with\r\nhim to ensure that this historic fiftieth session is as\r\nmemorable as it could possibly be.\r\nI join in warmly welcoming, as the 185th Member\r\nState of the United Nations, our fellow South Pacific Forum\r\nmember Palau.\r\nIf we are to effectively prepare for our future we must\r\nfirst be able to clearly see our past. If we are to see where\r\nwe must go, we must know where we have been: we must\r\nbe conscious of our failures, but we should be proud of our\r\nsuccesses.\r\nThe structure of today’s world community — of\r\nsovereign, self-determined, independent States working\r\ntogether on the basis of equality in a framework of\r\ninternational law — simply did not exist before the Charter\r\nof the United Nations came into being. There were\r\nimaginings of it in the minds of many for a very long time,\r\nand we saw emerge between the two world wars a pale\r\napproximation of it with the League of Nations. But it was\r\nat that special moment in San Francisco, 50 years ago, that\r\ntoday’s concept of a community of nations was first truly\r\nborn. And that concept has passed the test of 50 years of\r\nlife.\r\nGifted though the authors of the Charter were, they\r\nwould I think be awed to see how very much their vision\r\nof a globalized world has now been answered, and\r\nexceeded. Today’s world is one world, a world in which no\r\nindividuals and no States can aspire to solve all their\r\nproblems or fulfil all their dreams alone. The ideas of San\r\nFrancisco have entered into the unconscious of people all\r\nover the world. Those who refuse to acknowledge the\r\nglobal character of our world, or who recoil from it and\r\nretreat into unilateralism or, worse, isolationism, have\r\nsimply not understood the new dynamics that are at work.\r\nOurs is an age in which we are called to more, not less,\r\ncooperation — and to ever more, and more responsible,\r\nsharing of our common destiny.\r\nThe ideas of San Francisco have assumed many\r\nconcrete forms, which have deepened and expanded over\r\nthe last five decades. States now habitually, virtually\r\nautomatically, conduct their relations with each other on\r\nthe basis of the United Nations Charter. We have added\r\ncontinually to the corpus of international law and\r\nagreements made pursuant to the Charter, in ways that\r\nhave touched every aspect of modern life. We have built\r\ninstitutions that have sought to deliver to the peoples of\r\nthe world their most basic needs — for peace and\r\nsecurity, for economic well-being, and for dignity and\r\nliberty.\r\nIt was natural that following a devastating world war\r\nand the hideous brutality which accompanied it, the\r\nCharter would have at its heart the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. So far, anyway, we have\r\npassed the test of ensuring that the world would never\r\nagain be subjected to global conflict. The United Nations\r\nhas been, of course, deeply challenged in the maintenance\r\nof peace, from the very beginning and ever since. There\r\nare areas in which its attempts to maintain and restore\r\npeace have been flawed, and where the United Nations\r\nhas faltered. But for all that has gone wrong in places like\r\nBosnia and Somalia and Rwanda we should not forget the\r\nsuccesses, like those in El Salvador, Cambodia and\r\nMozambique. To go back a generation, no one should\r\nforget the role that was played by the Security Council\r\nand the Secretary-General in that desperate month of\r\nOctober 1962 when the hands of the clock were seconds\r\nbefore midnight and the world did face potential nuclear\r\nholocaust. And no one should forget the role that, for\r\nexample, the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty has played\r\nin falsifying the almost universal prediction in the 1960s\r\nthat within two decades there would be 20 or more States\r\npossessing nuclear weapons.\r\nIn development, in seeking to fulfil its commitment\r\nto promote \"social progress and better standards of life\"\r\nthe United Nations has laboured hard, sometimes in very\r\ndifficult circumstances. The gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries remains unacceptably high; there\r\nhave been and continue to be difficulties with the\r\navailability of resources for development assistance; and\r\nwe have to acknowledge the awful reality, according to\r\nthe World Bank, that 1.3 billion of our people still live in\r\nabsolute poverty. But in food and agriculture, in\r\nemployment and labour standards, in health, in education\r\nand in building the infrastructure so vital to communities\r\nin the developing world — roads, bridges, water\r\nsystems — the United Nations and its agencies have\r\nworked relentlessly in the service of the human family. It\r\nis because of the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) that today 80 per cent of the world’s children\r\nare immunized against six killer diseases. And this is just\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\none of hundreds of similar stories that the United Nations\r\ncan and should be telling.\r\nBasic to the United Nations concept of the world\r\ncommunity was that it should operate under and foster the\r\ndevelopment of law, justice and human rights. A\r\nfundamental commitment of the United Nations is to\r\nestablish conditions under which justice may prevail,\r\ninternational law will be respected and peace can be built.\r\nIn fulfilment of this charge, the United Nations has\r\nprovided the setting for the negotiation of over 300 major\r\ntreaties, including in such crucial fields as arms control,\r\ntransport, navigation and communications. This very\r\npractical area of international cooperation has formed the\r\nframework of a globalized world.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations speaks not just of\r\nsecuring better standards of life, but of those better\r\nstandards being enjoyed “in larger freedom”. And the\r\narticulation, development and implementation of human\r\nrights standards across the whole spectrum of rights —\r\neconomic, social and cultural as well as political and\r\ncivil — has been one of the most important and\r\nconstructive roles of the United Nations. One of the worst\r\nof all denials of personal and political freedom was that\r\nimposed by apartheid. The triumph over that evil was above\r\nall a victory for those South Africans and their leaders\r\nwhose freedom and dignity apartheid had so long denied.\r\nBut it would ignore the testimony of history not to\r\nrecognize the importance of the role played by the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council in creating the\r\nconditions for that to occur.\r\nFor the peoples of this world, no political right has\r\nbeen more important than the right to self-determination.\r\nThe achievements of the United Nations in this field alone\r\nare testimony to the indispensable role it has played in\r\nhuman affairs, with hundreds of millions of people having\r\nexercised their right to self-determination in these past 50\r\nyears. It is the great movement of decolonization, as much\r\nas the cold war and its aftermath, that defines the modern\r\nworld as we now know it, and which shapes the world’s\r\nagenda for the years that lie ahead.\r\nThe United Nations of the future will need to be,\r\nabove all, an organization which works and speaks for all\r\nits Members, no matter how large or small, and whose\r\nlegitimacy is thus without question. It must be an\r\norganization better oriented to performance, to delivery to\r\npeople of the things they need and have a right to expect.\r\nAnd it must be an organization which seeks to reintegrate,\r\nand better coordinate, the implementation of the three basic\r\nobjectives of the United Nations so clearly articulated at\r\nSan Francisco 50 years ago: the objectives of peace —\r\nmeeting the need for security; of development —\r\nmeeting economic needs; and of human rights and\r\njustice — meeting the need for individual and group\r\ndignity and liberty.\r\nIn the peace agenda, disarmament and arms control\r\ncontinue to be of crucial importance, and a major\r\nchallenge immediately ahead will be to maintain the\r\nmomentum of multilateral disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation efforts. The decision by the Review and\r\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to extend the\r\nTreaty indefinitely was, and remains — despite what has\r\nhappened since — the right decision. The work on a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty must be brought to\r\nconclusion, as promised, in the first half of 1996. We\r\nmust also begin as soon as possible negotiations on a\r\ntreaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear-\r\nweapons purposes. A further helpful step, although more\r\ndifficult to achieve, would be a regime requiring all States\r\nto declare and account for their present stocks of fissile\r\nmaterial. The basic objective in all of this is to move\r\ntowards the goal that is agreed by all — and it should\r\nnever be forgotten that it has been agreed by all —\r\nnamely, that we will, ultimately, eliminate all nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nIt is in this context particularly that the decisions by\r\nFrance and China to continue nuclear testing are to be so\r\nstrongly deplored. The environmental consequences are\r\nbad enough of setting off an explosion more than five\r\ntimes the size of that which destroyed Hiroshima — as\r\nFrance did yesterday on the fragile atoll of Fangataufa in\r\nAustralia’s Pacific neighbourhood. But the nuclear policy\r\nconsequences are even worse. This is not the time to be\r\nreinforcing nuclear stockpiles and asserting their ongoing\r\ndeterrent role: the world wants and needs to be moving in\r\nthe opposite direction.\r\nThis is the time to be negotiating away those\r\nstockpiles, and building verification systems of the kind\r\nwe did with the chemical weapons Convention — which\r\nstill needs to be ratified to come into effect — and I urge\r\nthose States that have not yet acceded to that Convention\r\nto do so urgently. This is not the time to be encouraging\r\nscepticism about the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, as\r\nthe Chinese and French tests are doing. It is, rather, the\r\ntime for the nuclear Powers to be encouraging the\r\nuniversal observance of that Treaty in the way that they\r\nbest can: by showing that they themselves are absolutely\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nserious about moving to eliminate nuclear weapons from\r\nthe face of the globe. The best way for them to do that\r\nright now is for France and China to immediately end their\r\ntesting programmes; for all the nuclear-weapon States to\r\nsign the nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties that now exist in\r\nthe South Pacific and elsewhere; and for those States to\r\ncommit themselves wholeheartedly to negotiating a\r\ngenuinely comprehensive, zero-threshold comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty into place by the middle of next year.\r\nThe past few turbulent years of United Nations\r\nexperience on the ground in peace-keeping and peace\r\nenforcement has underlined the need for it to improve the\r\neffectiveness of its work in these important fields. Australia\r\nhas welcomed the Secretary-General’s further work in this\r\narea in his very lucid January 1995 “Supplement to An\r\nAgenda for Peace\u0027”. In our own contributions to the debate\r\non these issues, we have argued for the clearest possible\r\nthinking to be given to the achievability of objectives right\r\nacross the whole spectrum of responses to security\r\nproblems — from peace-building to peace maintenance to\r\npeace restoration to peace enforcement.\r\nWe have consistently argued, and I make the point\r\nagain very briefly today, that if the United Nations is to be\r\nable to meet effectively the security challenges of the\r\npost-cold-war world it must begin to devote more resources\r\nto preventive strategies than to reactive strategies. It just\r\nmakes more sense to concentrate on prevention than on\r\nafter-the-event peace restoration, both for inter-State\r\nconflict and in the unhappily now far more common case\r\nof intra-State conflict. Violent conflicts are always far more\r\ndifficult and costly to resolve than non-violent disputes, and\r\nfailed States are extremely difficult to piece back together.\r\nAll that said, it has been encouraging to see the\r\nprogress made in recent days towards resolving the conflict\r\nin the former Yugoslavia, and in moving the Middle East\r\npeace process a substantial new step forward. The United\r\nNations should always be prepared to lend its support and\r\nencouragement to preventive diplomacy and to peacemaking\r\nefforts taking place outside the formal framework of the\r\nUnited Nations system, and it should remain particularly\r\nalert to the opportunities envisaged in the Charter for\r\nadvancing the peace agenda through regional organizations.\r\nIn the latter context we in the Asia-Pacific have been very\r\npleased with the rapid evolution of the new Regional Forum\r\nof the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nover the last two years as a new vehicle for dialogue and\r\ntrust and confidence-building, in our own region.\r\nParticular attention has been given recently, as we all\r\nknow, to the question of improving the rapid reaction\r\ncapability of the United Nations, and I warmly commend\r\nthe work that has been done to clarify our thinking on\r\nthese issues by the Netherlands and Danish Governments,\r\nand particularly in the major Canadian report, “Towards\r\na Rapid Reaction Capability for the United Nations”, just\r\npresented to the Assembly. The very useful emphasis of\r\nthe Canadian study is on the idea of improving the United\r\nNations system’s capability at the centre first, particularly\r\nin the area of operational planning, and thereby\r\nencouraging greater willingness by troop contributors to\r\ngive practical and more urgent effect to stand-by\r\narrangements. No organizational arrangements will ever\r\nsubstitute for clear-eyed decision-making by the Security\r\nCouncil on the responses and mandates that are\r\nappropriate to particular situations, but the implementation\r\nof changes of this kind should make us much better\r\nequipped as an international community to deal in future\r\nwith situations like that in Rwanda, where last time our\r\nresponse was so tragically inadequate.\r\nThe security agenda tends to dominate most popular\r\nperceptions of the United Nations role, but we in the\r\ninternational community must never allow our attention to\r\nbe diverted from the demands of the development agenda,\r\nnow as pressing as ever. When historians hundreds of\r\nyears hence look back at this last half century, the cold\r\nwar and its aftermath will not be the only great\r\ninternational current to be remembered; it will be the\r\ngiant step of decolonization that looms at least as large.\r\nDecolonization led to the emergence of a world\r\neconomy which for many years has been seen as divided\r\nprincipally into two categories, the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries. But today, the picture is more\r\ncomplicated. Mainly for reasons of change in technology\r\nand information systems, we do now live in a global\r\neconomy. No part of it is entirely separate from the\r\nwhole, and no one can act in that global economy in an\r\neffective way, entirely alone. Because we live in that kind\r\nof economy a key part of our action to deal with the\r\nproblems of development must, accordingly, be\r\nmultilateral, and the key problem facing us, both\r\nmultilaterally and in our bilateral, donor roles, is that\r\nwithin the global economy the gap between rich and poor\r\ncountries, despite all efforts to resist this, has grown. The\r\nfact that some 1.3 billion of the 5.7 billion people alive\r\ntoday live at an unacceptable level of poverty is morally\r\ninsupportable, and dangerous.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nThe United Nations of the future must, as a matter of\r\nthe most urgent priority, forge a new agenda for\r\ndevelopment and reshape its relevant institutions to\r\nimplement that agenda effectively. This is as important as\r\nany task it faces in the service of the human family and in\r\nrecreating itself as an institution fit for the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The agenda is available for all to see. It has been\r\nfully described in the six global conferences held by the\r\nUnited Nations in the past four years — the conferences on\r\nchildren, the environment, human rights, population, social\r\ndevelopment, and now women. There have also been\r\nimportant studies by the international financial institutions\r\nand by academic institutions. We know now what we need\r\nto do. We must resolve, politically, to do it.\r\nIn pursuing these various themes it is important,\r\nhowever, for us not to lose sight of those geographical\r\nregions where particular focus is still required, and where\r\nthe United Nations role is more vital than ever. Africa’s\r\ninfluence and importance continues to be felt throughout the\r\nworld in every field of human activity and culture. Exciting\r\npolitical developments, including the ending of apartheid,\r\nhave been accompanied by major new efforts to restructure\r\nand reform national economies. Those efforts demand the\r\ncontinued support of the international community, and in\r\nparticular the United Nations system. Other regions where\r\nthe United Nations needs to play a particular role to\r\nfacilitate economic and social development are the Central\r\nAsian republics, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and in a\r\nnumber of areas in the Indian Ocean region.\r\nThe Indian Ocean region is one where Australia, as an\r\nIndian Ocean country as well as an Asia-Pacific country,\r\nhas been promoting, with others in the region, both\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental efforts to enhance\r\nregional cooperation, particularly on economic and trade\r\nissues. The success to date of the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council (APECC) in developing cooperative\r\nstrategies in the Asia-Pacific region to promote prosperity\r\nand stability, complementing the United Nations broader\r\nwork for these goals at the international level, does offer\r\none possible model for the countries of the Indian Ocean\r\nRim to consider.\r\nThe institutions of the United Nations relevant to\r\neconomic and social development are urgently in need of\r\nreform. The General Assembly has created the high-level\r\nWorking Group needed for political consensus on this. That\r\nmust complete its work in this fiftieth anniversary year, and\r\nit must do so creatively, setting aside past vested interests\r\nin the system. We must implement the development agenda\r\nof the future in a way which ensures a productive and fair\r\nplace in the global economy for all States.\r\nThe complex and interlinked system of principles,\r\nlegal regimes and machinery that the United Nations has\r\nestablished to promote human rights is one of its major\r\nachievements. It must be built upon and strengthened,\r\nrecognizing always that the human rights whose\r\nuniversality and indivisibility we assert are about\r\neconomic and social and cultural rights just as much as\r\nabout the civil and political rights on which the developed\r\ncountries tend to focus so much attention. Priority must\r\nbe given to the major international human rights\r\ninstruments and machinery and the committees which\r\nmonitor their implementation. By this means we can\r\nprovide a frank, non-confrontational and constructive\r\ndialogue amongst States parties.\r\nThe advisory services and technical-assistance\r\nactivities of the United Nations can also play a role in\r\npromoting the observance of human rights and the\r\nimplementation of democratic principles around the world.\r\nProgrammes to help countries develop their own national\r\ninstitutions and systems to promote and protect human\r\nrights will enhance their capacity to prevent violations\r\nand, accordingly, make a direct contribution to human\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt cannot be sufficiently emphasized enough that the\r\npeace and development and human-rights agendas I have\r\nmentioned are all interlinked. We need to avoid the\r\ncompartmentalization that occurred throughout the cold-\r\nwar years, in which peace-and-security issues,\r\ndevelopment issues and human-rights and justice issues\r\nwere isolated in completely different conceptual and\r\ninstitutional boxes. Any viable modern concept of\r\ninternational peace, let alone peace within States, must\r\nrecognize that peace and security and development are\r\nindissolubly bound up with each other. There can be no\r\nsustainable peace without development and no\r\ndevelopment without peace. And human rights, in the\r\nfullest sense, as I have described them, have to come into\r\nthe equation too. There is unlikely to be sustainable peace\r\nin any society if material needs are satisfied but needs for\r\ndignity and liberty are not.\r\nNo agendas of substance, no matter how clear in\r\nconcept, how well-coordinated in principle they may be,\r\nwill mean anything to people if they are not able to be\r\nimplemented through effective organizational structures\r\nand instruments. There has been widespread recognition\r\nin recent years, as we all know, that the structure of the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nUnited Nations that grew up during the past 50 years is\r\nsimply not adequate to the tasks of the next.\r\nWe now have an embarrassment of riches with respect\r\nto ideas and proposals for change to the United Nations.\r\nJust as it is urgent that we complete work on “An Agenda\r\nfor Development” in this fiftieth year, it is equally urgent\r\nthat we complete the work of the high-level Working Group\r\non the reform of the United Nations system also within this\r\nfiftieth year.\r\nThe structural problem that it is probably the most\r\nurgently necessary to resolve, if the credibility of the whole\r\nUnited Nations system is to be maintained, is that of the\r\nSecurity Council. The debate on this subject has been long\r\nand detailed and is familiar to all of us. Australia’s definite\r\nview is that it has been going on for long enough, and we\r\nare now at the time when action is required. Last year, we\r\nsubmitted some illustrative models on the basis of which\r\nconsideration could be given to an expansion in the\r\nmembership of the Council. Others have made very specific\r\nproposals. Again, in this field there is no lack of ideas.\r\nWhat we have to do now is move to the stage of forging\r\npolitical consensus on a new Security Council, which will\r\nbe effective, represent the whole membership of the United\r\nNations and sensibly reflect the realities of today and the\r\nfuture, not those of 1945.\r\nThere are many structural changes and personnel\r\nreforms that could and should be made within the United\r\nNations system to improve its efficiency. But ultimately the\r\nquality of that system depends on what we are prepared to\r\npay for it.\r\nIt is important to appreciate at the outset the order of\r\nmagnitude of the sums we are talking about. The core\r\nfunctions of the United Nations, involving the Headquarters\r\nin New York, the Offices in Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi,\r\nand the five regional Commissions, cost just US$ 1.2\r\nbillion between them. To take just one comparison, last\r\nyear the annual budget of just one Department in one\r\nUnited States city, the New York Police Department,\r\nexceeded that $1.2 billion by $600 million.\r\nThe total number of personnel needed to run those\r\nUnited Nations core functions is around 10,700. Compare\r\nthe local administration of my own national capital,\r\nCanberra — again, just one city in one of the 185 States\r\nMembers of the United Nations — which has some 22,000\r\nemployees on the public payroll.\r\nThe cost of United Nations peace operations last\r\nyear, in Cyprus, Western Sahara, the former Yugoslavia\r\nand 13 other locations, was $3.2 billion. That is less than\r\nwhat it takes to run just three New York City\r\nDepartments: the Police Department, the Fire Department\r\nand the Department of Correction.\r\nIf we add to the core functions of the United Nations\r\nall the related programmes and organs, including the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP), we are still talking about\r\na total of around 33,000 people and a total budget,\r\nincluding both assessed and voluntary contributions, of\r\n$6.3 billion. That sounds a lot — rather more than just\r\nfor the core functions — but it is not quite so much when\r\none considers, for example, that the annual global\r\nturnover of just one international accounting firm, Price\r\nWaterhouse, is around $4.5 billion.\r\nIf we go further than that and add to the core\r\nfunctions and related programmes all the other specialized\r\nprogrammes and agencies of the entire United Nations\r\nfamily — agencies such as the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization (FAO), the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO), the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency, and put into the equation as well\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions — the World Bank group\r\nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which\r\nbetween them employ nearly 10,000 people and spend $5\r\nbillion annually — we are still talking about total United\r\nNations-system personnel of just around 61,400 and a\r\ntotal United Nations-system dollar cost of $18.2 billion.\r\nA total of 61,400 may sound like a lot of people,\r\nand it is, but perhaps it is not so many when we consider\r\nthat more than this number — 65,000, in fact — are\r\nemployed by the three Disney theme parks in California,\r\nFlorida and France. Three times as many people sell\r\nMcDonald’s hamburgers around the world as work for the\r\nUnited Nations system. And $18.2 billion might be a lot\r\nof money, but just one major multinational corporation,\r\nDow Chemical, which happens also to have 61,000\r\nemployees world wide, has an annual revenue in excess\r\nof $20 billion.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nWhen we put the financial problems of the United\r\nNations into this kind of perspective, as I think we ought to\r\ndo more often, the solutions do not really look quite so\r\nhard. Surely, between us, with our combined defence\r\nexpenditure alone of around $767 billion, the 185 Member\r\nStates can find that kind of money. But, of course, the\r\nproblem of paying for the United Nations has now become\r\ncritical because of the unwillingness or inability of so many\r\nof the Member States, including the biggest of us all, to\r\npay their assessed contributions, notwithstanding that the\r\ncost of these for the major developed-country contributors\r\nworks out at between $7 and $15 per head per year — the\r\nprice of no more than one or two movie tickets in this city.\r\nWe have a short-term problem, which I believe can\r\nand should be solved within the United Nations system by\r\nallowing the United Nations to borrow from the World\r\nBank. But we also have a longer-term problem which,\r\nfrankly, does not look as though it is going to be solved,\r\nhowever much we continue to work at adjusting assessment\r\nscales, exhort Member States to pay up and remind them of\r\nthe consequences under Article 19 of the Charter if they\r\nfail to do so.\r\nSo what are we to do about all this? In my judgement,\r\nit is time to look again — this time very seriously\r\nindeed — at the options which exist for supplementing\r\nMember States’ contributions with external sources of\r\nfinance. The practicability of collecting a levy on every one\r\nof the $300,000 billion worth of foreign-exchange\r\ntransactions that now occur every year remains to be fully\r\nassessed, but simple arithmetic tells us that if we strike a\r\nrate of just .001 per cent for such a levy, which hardly\r\nseems likely to have any significant economic\r\nconsequences, we could generate $3 billion in revenue.\r\nMoreover, we know that if we could impose a levy on\r\ninternational airline passengers of $10 for every\r\ninternational sector flown, which would be very easily\r\ncollectible indeed, we could also raise $3 billion: nearly the\r\nwhole annual cost of United Nations peace operations.\r\nThere are also other revenue options that, to a greater\r\nor lesser extent, have the same rational nexus with United\r\nNations costs as these do, in that they involve transactions\r\nwhich are international, take place within a framework of\r\nlaw and cooperation provided by the United Nations and\r\ncan be harmed by a breakdown in international peace and\r\nsecurity — precisely the areas in which the United Nations\r\nhas a fundamental responsibility.\r\nBut traditionally, a threshold objection of principle has\r\nbeen mounted against any such talk. Member States, it has\r\nbeen said, should themselves wholly own the United\r\nNations system; if the Secretariat had direct access to\r\nrevenue other than assessed contributions of Member\r\nStates, who knows what adventures it might be inclined\r\nto get up to. But ownership and control are totally\r\nseparate issues. The United Nations operates on a\r\nsovereign-equality principle, which means that, for\r\nexample, those six States which between them pay at\r\npresent over 65 per cent of the United Nations regular\r\nbudget should under no circumstances have greater\r\nauthority over how it is spent than the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Members, each of which pays much lesser\r\nproportions of the total.\r\nWhatever the funding sources involved, the crucial\r\nquestion is surely how and by whom the money is spent.\r\nIt is absolutely crucial that there be appropriate control of\r\nfunds by Member States, with all the accountability\r\nmechanisms that implies. But that does not mean that\r\nthose Member States should themselves have to provide\r\nall the funds in the first place.\r\nIn talking about these issues to many of my\r\nministerial colleagues from a wide range of countries and\r\nacross all continents over the last few days, I have found\r\nthe almost unanimous reaction that the present, and likely\r\ncontinuing, financial crisis of the United Nations demands\r\nthat these issues be looked at again, without any\r\nprejudgements of the questions of principle or\r\npracticability involved.\r\nI would suggest accordingly that the time is right for\r\nthe Secretary-General to convene once again a high-level\r\nadvisory group, like the Volcker-Ogata group established\r\nin 1992, with a mandate to think explicitly through what\r\nhas hitherto been more or less unthinkable: how to fund\r\nthe United Nations system in a way that reaches out\r\nbeyond the resources that Member States are prepared to\r\nput directly into it. Such a group could report to or work\r\nwith a committee of representatives of Member States —\r\none in existence already, such as the High-Level Working\r\nGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations or\r\none newly created for the purpose.\r\nA great deal of work has already been or is being\r\ndone on many of these issues, and it should be possible\r\nfor such a group to report within six months or so —\r\ncertainly within a year. The parameters of the debate have\r\nto be changed, and for that to happen we need an\r\nauthoritative new statement of the art of the possible.\r\nHere, as elsewhere, we have to move forward. We\r\nhave to look to new ideas. We have to encourage\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nhumankind’s ingenuity to search for better ways for States\r\nto deal with each other as relationships take new shape, as\r\nnew States emerge and as problems which could not have\r\nbeen conceived of a few years ago become the challenges\r\nof the day.\r\nWe will fail to meet those challenges if we adhere\r\nsolely to the ideas and dogma of the past. The United\r\nNations was itself founded on a mixture of idealism and\r\npragmatism. Both were essential to build a new world 50\r\nyears ago, and in the past 50 years that idealism has not\r\ndisappeared. It was an important force in bringing about the\r\nend of the cold war, and, more than anything else, it was\r\nidealism that lay behind the process of decolonization,\r\nwhich so shifted the tectonic plates of history.\r\nTo some idealism will always be the enemy of\r\npracticality. But to others it will always involve, more than\r\nanything else, the courage to take advantage of new\r\nopportunities, ensuring that at least some of today’s ideals\r\nwill become tomorrow’s reality. Perhaps now, 50 years\r\nbeyond San Francisco, we need to renew that idealism and\r\nwalk down some of those uncharted paths that idealists\r\nhave always been prepared to tread.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call on the Acting Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nPhilippines, His Excellency Mr. Domingo Siazon.\r\nMr. Siazon (Philippines): It is with special fervour\r\nthat I congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral, on behalf of the\r\nPhilippine delegation, on his election as President of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly in this landmark session.\r\nLet me also express the gratitude of my delegation to Mr.\r\nAmara Essy, the Foreign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, for the\r\nexcellent leadership which he provided us at our forty-ninth\r\nsession. Our tribute goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali and to the men and women of the\r\nSecretariat, who, in the course of the past year, carried out\r\ntheir indispensable tasks under circumstances of great\r\ndifficulty for them and for the Organization.\r\nIn three weeks, most of the world’s Heads of State or\r\nGovernment will gather in this Hall to commemorate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. They\r\nwill no doubt recall how the founding fathers of our\r\nOrganization convened in San Francisco, animated by their\r\nresolve to transform the world. It was a world devastated\r\nby a global war. Like most wars, it was ignited by the\r\npropensity and ability of nations to use force to acquire\r\nterritory and resources, to avenge past wrongs, or to\r\npromote, at the expense of others, the security and\r\nwelfare of their people.\r\nThis was the world which the United Nations was\r\ncreated to transform. Our founding fathers were idealistic\r\nenough to insist that questions of war and peace had\r\nultimately to be resolved in the hearts and minds of men\r\nand nations; but they were realistic enough to recognize\r\nthat practical measures and considerations were necessary\r\nto deter the use of force and mitigate its effects. They\r\nwere realistic enough to concede that States that held a\r\npreponderance of military force had to be allowed a large\r\nmeasure of authority and responsibility; but they were\r\nidealistic enough to hope that those States would use their\r\npower for the good of all.\r\nWith the hindsight of 50 years, we can see that the\r\nUnited Nations has not fulfilled the vision that the\r\nfounders had for it, but it succeeded well beyond what it\r\nwas reasonable to expect of it at that time. The world was\r\nspared yet another global cataclysm. The quiet work of\r\nthe United Nations, particularly through its specialized\r\nagencies, advanced the well-being and raised the standard\r\nof living of countless millions around the world.\r\nSadly, however, these considerable achievements\r\nwere offset, in a fundamental way, by the continued and\r\nrepeated defiance of the United Nations proclaimed\r\npurposes by so many men and nations, in so many\r\ninstances. Almost from the beginning of the existence of\r\nthe United Nations, and despite the United Nations, man\r\npersisted in his ability, propensity and willingness to use\r\nforce in order to achieve his national or ideological ends.\r\nIf peace was kept on a global scale, it was only because\r\nthe mutual threat of nuclear annihilation deterred the\r\nlaunching of full-scale war. In the international economy,\r\ncountries sought to beggar their neighbours through the\r\nunabashed use of a full range of protectionist and\r\nmercantilist tools.\r\nToday, however, in the fiftieth year of the United\r\nNations, we can say with a measure of plausibility, that\r\nthe world has indeed been transformed; and we can hope,\r\nwith a degree of realism, that the idealistic vision of the\r\nUnited Nations can be substantially attained.\r\nOne of the central aims of the United Nations — the\r\nliberation of colonized nations — has been largely\r\nachieved. The world’s most mightily armed Powers have\r\npulled back from the brink of nuclear annihilation. No\r\nlonger do nuclear-armed ideological camps face each\r\nother in deadly confrontation, and mankind’s survival no\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nlonger hangs in the perilous balance of mutual nuclear\r\nthreat. The Philippines is gratified by the decision earlier\r\nthis year to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls for the\r\nconclusion early next year of a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty that would put an absolute end to all nuclear testing.\r\nThe international community has reached agreement\r\non the elimination of other devices of mass destruction and\r\nof inhumane weapons. In particular, the Philippines urges\r\nthe ratification and the strengthening of the 1980\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of Restrictions on the Use of\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to\r\nbe Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects.\r\nWe call for the early entry into force of the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production and\r\nStockpiling of Chemical Weapons and on Their\r\nDestruction, and the full implementation of the Convention\r\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production and\r\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) Weapons and\r\nToxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.\r\nIn place of the use and threat of force, more and more\r\nnations have resorted to dialogue and reconciliation in\r\ndealing with disputes among themselves or with their\r\nneighbours, even in the case of conflicts which the\r\n“realistic” had considered to be insoluble. Almost\r\nthroughout its entire existence, the United Nations has been\r\nseized with the conflicts in the Middle East. But only four\r\ndays ago, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization,\r\nwith the approbation of other States in the area, took\r\nanother significant step on the difficult road to peace. In\r\nSouth Africa, where a minority regime long oppressed the\r\nmajority with systematic cruelty, a multiracial Government\r\nnow administers the country with success that has surpassed\r\neven the world’s most fervent expectations. In Latin\r\nAmerica, old territorial disputes are now the subject of\r\ndialogue and consultation.\r\nIn our own region, the political settlement of the\r\nconflict in Cambodia and the emergence of an elected\r\ngovernment in that long-suffering country stand as\r\ncrowning achievements of the United Nations, as well as of\r\nthe countries of the region — a triumph of negotiation over\r\nthe force of arms. We welcome the accord that was so\r\npainstakingly crafted a year ago to avert the development\r\nof nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula. We urge the\r\nresumption of serious talks between North and South Korea\r\nas a further contribution to peace and reconciliation in our\r\nregion. The Government of Myanmar has agreed on a\r\ncease-fire and has undertaken negotiations with all but one\r\nof the minority nationalities in Myanmar, a remarkable\r\ndevelopment in a country riven by inter-ethnic conflict for\r\nso long.\r\nMatching the spread of the spirit of dialogue and\r\nreconciliation, faith in the efficacy of market forces and\r\neconomic liberalization as a condition and stimulant of\r\ndevelopment has been sweeping the world. Policies\r\narising from this faith have unleashed the productive\r\nenergies of many of the world’s people, a development\r\nlargely responsible for the remarkable economic growth\r\nof countries in many parts of the world. Liberalization of\r\ninternational economic transactions and the resulting\r\ninterdependence of the global economy have raised the\r\nstake of nations in one another’s prosperity and have thus\r\nconsiderably brightened the prospects of enduring stability\r\nand peace. Thus, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\nCouncil, of which the Philippines is an active founding\r\nparticipant, is devoted solely to economic collaboration.\r\nBut one of its salutary by-products is the\r\nstrengthening of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion, for now APEC participants have a growing stake\r\nin one another’s economic progress and political stability.\r\nWe find in my country, the Philippines, a microcosm\r\nof the global trend of political reconciliation, economic\r\nliberalization, and regionalism. The peace talks that we\r\nare undertaking with rebel groups in the spirit of national\r\nreconciliation have brought a new stability to the country,\r\nproviding the atmosphere of tranquillity so necessary for\r\nthe resurgence of the economy.\r\nThe military rebels have availed themselves of a\r\nprogramme of amnesty. Many of them now pursue their\r\nambitions for the country through the legal political\r\nsystem, with one of them recently elected as a Senator of\r\nthe Republic. The Government has been negotiating in\r\nEurope with the self-exiled leaders of the Communist\r\nParty, which is now legal in the Philippines and whose\r\nmembers are free to contest Philippine elections.\r\nWith the assistance of the Committee of Six of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, under the\r\nchairmanship of Indonesia, negotiations are taking place\r\nwith the Moro National Liberation Front. These\r\nnegotiations have resulted in a cease-fire and agreement\r\non more than 80 per cent of the points at issue. Peace in\r\nthe southern Philippines has made possible an\r\nextraordinary surge in the economic growth of that\r\nregion. We have opened wide the doors to the Philippine\r\neconomy, welcoming foreign investment, letting in the\r\nbracing wind of foreign competition. We have lowered\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nour barriers to trade in fulfilment of international\r\ncommitments or through unilateral measures.\r\nOne of the results of these structural reforms is a\r\ngrowth rate that is respectable even by the standards of our\r\nfast-growing region. There are bright prospects for the\r\ncontinuation of this growth rate because it proceeds from\r\nsolid policy foundations and is taking place within a system\r\nof pluralistic democracy, respect for human rights, and the\r\nrule of law.\r\nWe have strengthened our bonds with our neighbours,\r\nthrough the Association of South-East Asian Nations above\r\nall. We have dealt with border questions and territorial\r\ndisputes, including the conflicting claims in the South\r\nChina Sea, through peaceful dialogue and consultation.\r\nThe general improvement in global security, the rising\r\ntide of global prosperity, and the intensification of regional\r\ncooperation should give rise to hope, but it should not\r\ninduce complacency, as new threats have arisen to confront\r\nus and old ones have swollen in magnitude and virulence.\r\nThe dissolution of power blocs has unleashed latent\r\ntribalism that had been under authoritarian constraint. One\r\nof the most savage manifestations of this has been taking\r\nplace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nInternational terrorism has become a global menace.\r\nThe illicit trade in drugs undermines the fabric of society.\r\nTrafficking in women and children is a crime that cries out\r\nfor international cooperative countermeasures.\r\nThe recent resumption of nuclear testing by two of the\r\nnuclear-weapon States poses an immediate threat to\r\npeople’s health, the natural environment, and the\r\nnon-proliferation regime. We repeat our condemnation of\r\nthese tests and ask that they stop — now and forever.\r\nEven as the notion of economic liberalization has been\r\nalmost universally embraced as a condition and catalyst for\r\ndevelopment, many countries have resorted to inventive\r\nmeasures of disguised protectionism. Numerous developing\r\ncountries continue to labour, like Sisyphus, under the\r\ncrushing burden of foreign debt.\r\nShortages of labour in resource-rich or rapidly\r\nindustrializing economies have induced the large-scale\r\nmigration of workers across national boundaries. Their\r\npresence in foreign lands has placed them in positions of\r\nvulnerability that require international cooperation for the\r\nprotection of their rights and dignity as human beings.\r\nThe Philippines calls upon all States to ratify the\r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights\r\nof All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.\r\nThe Philippines is at one with the Group of 77 in calling\r\nfor a United Nations-sponsored global conference on\r\ninternational migration.\r\nMy delegation intends to pursue with great vigour\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on violence against women\r\nmigrant workers and on trafficking in women and girls.\r\nThese are some of the more outstanding challenges\r\nthat confront the United Nations as it enters its second\r\nhalf-century and approaches the next millennium. The\r\nUnited Nations, however, cannot respond to the\r\nchallenges of today and the next century with the\r\norganization and procedures of 50 years ago. The nature\r\nof the new threats to international peace and security\r\nrequires a review of United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations in order to streamline them and make them\r\nmore effective.\r\nAt this stage, I must stress that, whatever measures\r\nare agreed upon, they must be financed adequately, in\r\nproportion to the capacity and degree of responsibility of\r\nMember States and not by sacrificing any development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe United Nations is in a desperate financial\r\nsituation. We cannot demand that it fulfil tasks that we\r\nare unwilling to finance. We cannot simply use the United\r\nNations and then withhold from it the resources needed\r\nfor its effective functioning. Year after year, we call for\r\nbetter management of the United Nations. The Philippines\r\nsupports this call, and strongly articulated its position in\r\nthis Hall last year.\r\nAt the same time, we must point out that the United\r\nNations cannot be managed efficiently if it is constantly\r\nuncertain of the resources available to it. We therefore\r\nappeal to all Member States, particularly the larger\r\ncontributors, to make up their arrears, to pay their dues,\r\nand to pay on time.\r\nWe have of late heard the proposition that in trying\r\nto achieve economy and efficiency in the United Nations\r\nwe should look to the economic and social area, to those\r\nbodies whose mandate is to advance the interests of the\r\ndeveloping countries — abolishing agencies here, gutting\r\nprogrammes there. We support the streamlining of\r\nmultilateral development institutions and programmes. But\r\nwe cannot accept moves to abolish the development\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nagencies in the name of the \"division of labour\" or\r\n“comparative advantage”. What the international community\r\nneeds to do with respect to these agencies — and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the regional development\r\nbanks — is to augment their resources, not to reduce them.\r\nWe deplore the position of some Powers that refuse to raise\r\ntheir contributions to the international and regional financial\r\ninstitutions, but in their desire to maintain a dominant role\r\nin those bodies prevent others from increasing their own\r\nshare.\r\nWe have all come to this session ready to address the\r\nquestion of reform of the structure of the Security Council.\r\nThe Council’s structure is no longer adequate to meet the\r\nnew and enlarged demands upon its mandate and no longer\r\nreflects the size and composition of the United Nations. The\r\nPhilippines fully supports the enlargement of the Council’s\r\nmembership in order to ensure the equitable representation\r\nof all regions and of the developing countries.\r\nAny reform, however, must go beyond the question of\r\nmembership. The question of the veto must be reviewed, as\r\nmust the Council’s working methods and procedures, in\r\norder to ensure the greatest transparency possible and the\r\nparticipation of as broad a range of countries as possible.\r\nThe vital nature of its decisions requires no less.\r\nAt the same time, the growing importance of the role\r\nof the United Nations requires that its membership, as well\r\nas its functions, reflect the realities of today. Accordingly,\r\nwe need to consider the proposition that, in the high\r\ninterests of universality, no significant group of people\r\nshould be left without representation in the United Nations.\r\nIn this fiftieth year, as we recall the founding\r\nprinciples and fundamental goals of our Organization, as we\r\nreview its mandate and as we assess its strengths and\r\nweaknesses, its achievements and shortcomings, we must\r\nnever lose sight of the fact that all our labours in the\r\nUnited Nations have as their centre and object the human\r\nperson — his or her security, dignity and well-being —\r\nabove ideology, above religion, above even the State itself.\r\nWith the shrinking of this planet Earth, a process\r\nhelped in no small measure by the United Nations itself,\r\nhundreds of millions more people are crying out for their\r\nown empowerment and for the universal respect of their\r\nrights and dignity.\r\nIn this fiftieth year of our Organization, we in the\r\nUnited Nations must heed their cry if we are to keep faith\r\nwith its mandate and mission.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet\r\nNam, His Excellency Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Manh Cam (Viet Nam) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): Allow me at the outset, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at this session, a\r\nhistoric session that coincides with the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. I am confident that under his\r\nguidance, our session will be crowned with success.\r\nLet me take this opportunity also to convey our\r\nappreciation for the dynamic and effective activities\r\nundertaken by his predecessor, His Excellency Minister\r\nAmara Essy. We would like to express our appreciation\r\nalso for the perseverance shown by His Excellency Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali in serving the common cause of all\r\nnations for peace, national independence and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is a special\r\noccasion for us to look back at the changes in the world\r\nand at the growth of the United Nations over the past 50\r\nyears, since the end of the Second World War. Out of\r\nthe tumultuous course of mankind’s history in those 50\r\nyears, let us identify what has changed, what has not, and\r\nwhat cannot change. Only with such a clear vision will\r\nwe be able to chart our course into the twenty-first\r\ncentury and to find the confidence to build a United\r\nNations that can meet the expectations of all of us.\r\nWhile the first half of the twentieth century has left\r\nin the mind of mankind the haunting memories of two\r\ndreadful world wars, in the second half of this century,\r\ndespite the fierce local wars that have taken place — such\r\nas those in Indochina, Korea and Viet Nam — nations\r\nhave been spared the horrors of a global conflagration.\r\nMoreover, after several decades of an unbridled arms\r\nrace, the world has chosen the course of reason, striving\r\nfor the long-term goal of general and complete\r\ndisarmament, especially with regard to nuclear weapons\r\nand other weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe recent indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons gave rise to much\r\nhope. However, the nuclear testing undertaken right\r\nafterwards caused disillusion in international public\r\nopinion and has made it imperative for all nations — first\r\nand foremost the nuclear-weapon States — to redouble\r\ntheir efforts in a fully responsible manner, so as to\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\ncomplete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course of\r\nthe next year.\r\nWhile the threat of a new world war and a nuclear\r\nholocaust is receding, peace and security remain elusive for\r\nmany regions and countries beset by racial, ethnic and\r\nreligious conflicts, and terrorist activities that take on\r\ndisquieting proportions. In the intractable case of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, a peaceful solution should be pursued,\r\nwithout the imposition of measures, from any quarter\r\nwhatsoever, that may complicate the situation further and\r\ncause more suffering to the multi-ethnic population of\r\nBosnia.\r\nThe past half-century can also be said to have been a\r\nshining chapter in the history of the struggle of peoples to\r\nregain their national independence, sovereignty and the\r\nright to be the masters of their own destinies, and to strive\r\nfor well-being, freedom and equality within the\r\ninternational community. The international community has\r\nbeen following very closely the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast and welcomes its recent progress. Only strong political\r\nwill and respect for the fundamental national rights of the\r\nPalestinian people and the legitimate interests of all the\r\nparties concerned can bring about lasting stability in this\r\nregion of the world.\r\nIn practice, however, the basic and universal principles\r\nof sovereignty and sovereign equality continue to be\r\nignored or violated by reason of the unequal and\r\nundemocratic set-up of international relations and through\r\nimpositions upon, and interference in, the internal affairs of\r\nother countries, for different reasons and with a variety of\r\njustifications.\r\nAt the end of this twentieth century, thanks to\r\nmankind’s achievements in science and technology and in\r\ncommunication and production, and thanks also to the hard\r\nwork of all nations, our world as a whole has become more\r\nprosperous and more alive, with the manifold increase in\r\nmaterial and non-material flows and exchanges, thus\r\nfacilitating better mutual understanding and closer\r\nrelationships among nations. However, our conscience\r\ncannot rest easy in view of a reality that we cannot ignore:\r\nthe fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject\r\npoverty, and the challenges posed by the enormous gap\r\nbetween the annual per capita gross national product for the\r\nleast developed countries — less than $200 — and that of\r\nadvanced industrialized countries, which is more than a\r\nhundred times higher. Furthermore, all nations, no matter\r\nwhere in the world, face global problems that threaten our\r\neconomic achievements and the progress made in\r\nenhancing the quality of life.\r\nNowadays, mankind has a clearer, more holistic\r\nawareness of development, peace and security. We\r\nunderstand better the close correlation and interaction\r\nbetween economic development and social development,\r\nbetween internal security and external security, and\r\nbetween economic, social and military security.\r\nAnother reality of the world today, which is of far-\r\nreaching significance to each nation and individual, is the\r\nincreasing role of international law, which binds nations\r\nand circumscribes and harmonizes the behaviour of States\r\nthrough multilateral instruments and institutions. Such a\r\nrole is all the more crucial in the light of the tendency to\r\nblur the boundaries between national and international\r\njurisdiction, as well as to extend the enforcement of one\r\ncountry’s laws beyond its borders. Recently, international\r\nopinion has been increasingly concerned about the fact\r\nthat the implementation of United Nations sanctions is\r\nshifting towards punishment or retribution for private\r\npolitical motives, in contravention of the purposes\r\noriginally assigned by the Charter. Nor can public opinion\r\nremain unconcerned by the fact that sanctions in reality\r\naffect mainly the life and health of the innocent civilian\r\npopulation, and therefore cannot accept the prolongation\r\nof sanctions regardless of their effectiveness and\r\nconsequences. In view of this, international opinion\r\ncannot but protest the imposition of unilateral sanctions\r\nfor several decades, such as is the case of the embargo\r\nagainst Cuba. We express our sincere sympathy for the\r\nhardships experienced by the Cuban people and strongly\r\nurge that the embargo against Cuba be lifted, and that the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly be promptly\r\nand effectively implemented.\r\nIn short, 50 years after the Second World War, the\r\nworld offers us a scene of vivid contrasts between\r\ncontinuity and change, between stagnation and\r\ndevelopment, between division and integration, especially\r\nthe vast and profound integration that unfolds before us\r\nunder the impact of the trend towards interdependence,\r\nregionalization and globalization. Moreover, the powerful\r\nvitality and steadfast determination which drive peoples\r\nto preserve their national traditions and cultural identities\r\ndemonstrate their will to safeguard from within the\r\ninevitable process of international integration something\r\nstable and lasting, which links the present of each nation\r\nto the roots of its traditions, and the need to affirm the\r\nsingularity of each society, each nation and each\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\ncommunity, and not only of each individual. The history of\r\nthe past 50 years is a clear testimony thereof.\r\nOver the past half century, the United Nations has\r\nweathered the tests and trials of the cold war and of the\r\nimmediate post-cold-war years to endure and grow. Its\r\nindispensable role as a centre for harmonizing the actions\r\nof nation States in a world characterized by rapid and\r\ncomplex changes and increasing interdependence has been\r\nrecognized by all Members.\r\nAs I have mentioned, the United Nations has recorded\r\nsome encouraging achievements for peace and development,\r\nfor equality and justice. However, given the speed and\r\nscope of changes taking place in the world, it must be\r\nrecognized that the United Nations has failed to reform and\r\nadjust itself in keeping with the new situation and with the\r\ntrend of the times, and thus to address the needs of nations.\r\nWe are of the view that the peace-keeping operations of the\r\nUnited Nations must strictly observe the principle of respect\r\nfor independence, sovereignty and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States, and should go hand in hand with\r\nthe persevering search for a peaceful solution. The United\r\nNations ought to draw the lessons of the successes and\r\nfailures of its recent peace-keeping operations so as to\r\nbetter discharge the responsibility entrusted to it by the\r\ncommunity of its Member States. It is certain that in a few\r\nweeks, during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, our Heads of State and Government\r\nwill voice the hopes that the peoples of the world place in\r\nour Organization. For this reason, it is imperative that we\r\nturn the United Nations into an effective instrument to serve\r\nthe common ideals and interests of mankind in the next\r\ncentury. The challenge for the United Nations, as it tackles\r\nthe burning issues of today’s world, is to continue\r\nupholding the progressive spirit enshrined in its Charter and\r\nadequately to implement, with all due attention, both the\r\n“Agenda for Peace” and the “Agenda for Development”,\r\novercoming the discrepancy between the desirable and the\r\npossible so that the United Nations can be a true\r\nrepresentative — in the fullest sense of the term — of the\r\nexpectations and interests of its Members, in its structure\r\nand organization, its agenda, its mandate and its mode of\r\noperation. This requires that the General Assembly should\r\nplay an “essential role” as the Secretary-General reminded\r\nus at the opening of this session, namely that by virtue of\r\nthe principle of “equal rights ... of nations large and small”,\r\nit is the General Assembly that is endowed with the\r\ndemocratic legitimacy of our global Organization.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic Republic),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWe agree with the overall thrust of the draft\r\ndeclaration on the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations and believe that it is particularly important to\r\nreaffirm the principles of respect for independence,\r\nsovereignty and sovereign equality, territorial integrity and\r\nnon-interference in the jurisdiction and the internal affairs\r\nof nations, the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-\r\nuse of force or threat to use force. At the same time, the\r\npositive role that the United Nations has played and\r\nshould continue to play in helping nations exercise their\r\nright to self-determination and to development should not\r\nbe forgotten. The declaration should not fail to address\r\ntwo topical issues. One is the need for a Security Council\r\nthat is more effective, more representative and transparent\r\nin its workings, while the other is the need for adequate\r\nresources to enable the United Nations fully to carry out\r\nits mandate. Viet Nam recognizes a plain fact of everyday\r\nlife, which is that whoever contributes more shall be\r\nentitled to more rights. But conversely, whoever has more\r\nrights will have to show greater responsibility. Therefore,\r\nthe richest countries should set an example by meeting\r\ntheir financial obligations in full and on time, which is of\r\nvital significance for our Organization at this juncture. We\r\nparticularly agree with the stress placed by the draft\r\ndeclaration on poverty as the scourge visited upon billions\r\nof people on our planet, as well as on the human person\r\nas the centre of the whole development process. Those\r\nare only some preliminary observations.\r\nIn this incredibly changing world, the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion in general and South-East Asia in particular are\r\nentering a new era with profound changes and great\r\npromises for peaceful cooperation and dynamic\r\ndevelopment. Most striking is the common consciousness\r\nand efforts of the whole region directed towards building\r\na peaceful and stable environment conducive to the\r\ndevelopment of each country in the region and of the\r\nregion as a whole. As a country in the dynamic region\r\nand a member of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN), Viet Nam will make positive\r\ncontributions toward those common objectives.\r\nViet Nam’s official membership in ASEAN since\r\nlast July, the participation of Laos and Cambodia as\r\nobservers and Myanmar’s accession to the Bali Treaty\r\nhave opened up prospects for further strengthening\r\ncooperation throughout the region and for expanding\r\nASEAN into an association of all 10 countries of the\r\nregion. These are the foundation and components of a\r\nSouth-East Asia of peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nTogether with the other countries concerned, the ASEAN\r\ncountries recently held the second ASEAN Regional\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nForum, at which the participating countries agreed to\r\npromote cooperation on an equal footing among all parties,\r\nby taking the appropriate measures, and in the short term\r\nby stepping up confidence-building measures in order to\r\nconsolidate peace and security in the region.\r\nAlongside that favourable overall trend, there are\r\npotentially destabilizing factors in the region. The dispute\r\nin the Eastern Sea and other recent developments remain a\r\nsource of concern for countries both within and outside the\r\nregion. Regarding this issue, we would like to reaffirm once\r\nagain our position, which is that the disputes in the Eastern\r\nSea should be settled through peaceful negotiations in\r\naccordance with the principles contained in the Manila\r\nDeclaration adopted by ASEAN in 1992, as confirmed at\r\nthe recent ASEAN ministerial meeting in Brunei, and in\r\nconformity with international law, especially the 1982\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\r\nentered into force at the end of 1994. Pending a\r\nfundamental and lasting solution to these disputes, all\r\nparties concerned should maintain the status quo and refrain\r\nfrom any action that might further complicate the situation,\r\nespecially the use or threat of use of force.\r\nFor Viet Nam, 1995 has been a year of great historic\r\nsignificance. As we join the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in preparing for the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, our people are solemnly celebrating several\r\nother major events, especially the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nproclamation of our independence. During the past half\r\ncentury, our people have endured tremendous human\r\nsacrifice and material loss in order to safeguard our national\r\nindependence. To rebuild and develop our homeland, we\r\nhave overcome innumerable tests and trials, as well as the\r\nextremely heavy consequences of long and fierce wars.\r\nThanks to the determination of the whole nation united in\r\nmind and in action, our reform and renewal process, now\r\nin its tenth year, has achieved major initial results, thus\r\nmaking it possible to move to a new stage of development:\r\nthe industrialization and modernization of our country.\r\nRecent years have seen the continuous development of\r\nour economy, with an average annual growth rate of 8.2\r\nper cent, an annual increase in exports of 20 per cent, and\r\na 40 per cent annual increase in foreign investment. The\r\nstandard of living is steadily improving. Economic\r\ndevelopment is increasingly linked with social and cultural\r\ndevelopment. Our objective is to build a strong and\r\nprosperous Viet Nam with an equitable and civilized\r\nsociety. Alongside our economic reforms, we have carried\r\nout political reforms to build a State governed by the rule\r\nof law, and which is of the people, by the people and for\r\nthe people. On the basis of our 1992 Constitution, we\r\nhave promulgated a series of laws, codes and legal\r\ndecrees in order ever more completely to ensure the rights\r\nand interests of all citizens, and at the same time to create\r\na firm legal basis for governing the country. These all-\r\nround achievements constitute a firm guarantee of social\r\nand political stability and lay the foundation needed for\r\nfuture sustainable development.\r\nAlong with reform in all aspects of social life, Viet\r\nNam has consistently pursued its foreign policy of broad\r\nopenness, the thrust of which is to diversify and\r\nmultilateralize its external relations in order to create a\r\nstable environment and external conditions conducive to\r\nthe task of building and defending the country, and to\r\nenhance Viet Nam’s position on the international scene.\r\nTo implement this policy, Viet Nam has established\r\ndiplomatic relations with nearly 160 countries, including\r\nall the world’s major Powers and leading economic and\r\npolitical centres. Viet Nam’s accession to full membership\r\nof ASEAN, the signing of an agreement of cooperation\r\nwith the European Union, and the normalization and\r\nestablishment of full diplomatic relations with the United\r\nStates all took place in July this year. That was no\r\ncoincidence, but was the outcome of a whole process of\r\nimplementing a foreign policy inspired by a new spirit, by\r\nwhich Viet Nam is willing to be the friend of all nations\r\nin the international community, and to strive for peace,\r\nnational independence and development. This provides\r\neloquent testimony to the correctness of our foreign\r\npolicy and to its consonance with the trends of our times.\r\nAs it broadens its relations with all countries, Viet\r\nNam is also endeavouring consistently to improve and\r\nstrengthen relations with international organizations,\r\nincluding the international financial and monetary\r\ninstitutions, and is ready to participate in regional and\r\nglobal cooperation organizations. Following the\r\nnormalization of its relations with the International\r\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asia\r\nDevelopment Bank and its participation in the ASEAN\r\nFree Trade Area, Viet Nam is now actively preparing to\r\njoin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and\r\nthe World Trade Organization at an appropriate time. Viet\r\nNam continues to maintain close and effective\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and with specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations system.\r\nThe achievements of its foreign policy provide a\r\nnew impetus for Viet Nam to accelerate the process of\r\nregional and global integration, and to participate more\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\neffectively in global forums and institutions, with a view to\r\ntackling the pressing problems facing all mankind, and to\r\ncontributing meaningfully to the common endeavour of the\r\ninternational community to achieve peace, national\r\nindependence, friendship, cooperation among States and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nToday and in the weeks to come, from every point on\r\nthe horizon, peoples of the world, regardless of language,\r\nrace or culture, are turning to this Hall, where the\r\nrepresentatives of 185 countries are assembled at a historic\r\nmoment marking half a century of the United Nations with\r\nthe ardent hope and expectation that the Organization will\r\ntruly enter a new era, in which its own motto, “United for\r\na better world” can become a reality. There is no promise\r\nmore dear to our hearts and no commitment more solemn\r\nthan our determination to prepare ourselves for the common\r\njourney into the twenty-first century, to realize the noble\r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations for a better\r\nworld and for a fairer and more reasonable world order that\r\nwill meet the ardent hopes of the present generation and\r\nthat will build a sound foundation for succeeding\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Albania, His Excellency Mr. Alfred Serreqi, on\r\nwhom I call.\r\nMr. Serreqi (Albania): It gives me special pleasure to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Frietas do Amaral of Portugal on\r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfiftieth session. I take this opportunity to extend to him my\r\nbest wishes for success in the deliberations of this\r\nimportant gathering, and I assure him of the full\r\ncollaboration of the delegation of Albania.\r\nI also congratulate Mr. do Amaral’s predecessor, Mr.\r\nAmara Essy, on the excellent way he conducted the work\r\nof the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nI wish to express my highest regard for his unfailing\r\nendeavours to provide the Organization with ever more\r\neffective leadership.\r\nMy warmest greetings go to the Republic of Palau, the\r\nnewest State Member of the United Nations.\r\nSince March 1992 — the time of the final break with\r\nthe Communist regime — Albania has made tremendous\r\nprogress in its democratic processes. The building up and\r\nstrengthening of political pluralism, the rule of law,\r\nrespect for human rights in general and for those of\r\nminorities in particular, as well as the transition from a\r\ncentralized to a market economy, constitute the main\r\ndirections in which Albanian society is moving. The\r\ncountry is sustainably engaged in speedy economic reform\r\nsupported by a whole new set of laws, and the results of\r\nintensive transformation are very tangible.\r\nCertainly reform is not painless. In this regard, the\r\nGovernment is paying special and particular attention to\r\nimprovement of the living conditions of some social\r\ngroups that are more vulnerable to economic reform. I\r\nwish, on behalf of the Albanian Government, to avail\r\nmyself of the occasion to express gratitude to the donor\r\ncountries, the European Member States, the United States\r\nand the countries of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, as well as to international agencies such as\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the World\r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund, for the\r\nvaluable assistance provided to Albania.\r\nIn its efforts to eliminate the consequences of fatal\r\nlong isolation, Albania is convincingly engaged in an\r\nopen policy and has firmly abided by one of the major\r\nobjectives that the Government set out in its\r\nprogramme — the integration of the country into Europe,\r\nwhich implies the building of a Western-style society,\r\nadherence to its institutions and active participation in\r\nEuropean life.\r\nOur growing cooperation with the European Union,\r\nwhich we hope will in due course lead to the opening of\r\nnegotiations on and the conclusion of the Europe\r\nagreement, is a process that enjoys the backing of all\r\npolitical parties and all strata of the population. With a\r\nview to achieving full integration, we attach special\r\nimportance to cooperation with the Euro-Atlantic\r\nstructures, primarily the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO). Albania is the first country of the\r\nregion to have formally requested membership of NATO,\r\nand it is engaged in active cooperation within the\r\nPartnership for Peace. In this spirit of close cooperation,\r\nAlbania has offered action facilities to NATO, and it will\r\ncontinue to do so in the future, convinced that this will\r\nbenefit peace and security in the Balkans.\r\nTo this end, and desirous of demonstrating in a\r\npractical way its commitment to peace and security,\r\nAlbania has set up its first Albanian military unit to\r\nparticipate in the peace-keeping and humanitarian\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\noperations of the United Nations and will soon put this at\r\nthe disposal of the Organization.\r\nThe tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nwhich is suffering the consequences of Belgrade’s ambition\r\nto create a “Greater Serbia” — inspired by the philosophy\r\nof national chauvinism, the policy of “ethnic cleansing” and\r\nthe forceful changing of borders — lies at the centre of the\r\npresent-day Balkan crisis, concentrated in the former\r\nYugoslavia. Identification of the causes and culprits of the\r\ncrisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina now makes it easier for\r\nthe Balkan States and the international community at large\r\nto make realistic assessments of the situation in all the\r\nterritories of the former Yugoslavia and to seek adequate\r\napproaches for solution.\r\nIt is a fact that the international community and its\r\nmain actors have been present at all stages in dealing with\r\nthe conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, it has to be admitted that, despite the action taken\r\nso far, they have not always been consistent. For that\r\nreason, efficiency has for a long time left much to be\r\ndesired.\r\nThe many resolutions of the United Nations and of the\r\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, the\r\nactivities of the Contact Group, the projects offered and the\r\nplans suggested have not yet yielded the desired results.\r\nNevertheless, we think that the United Nations peace force\r\ndeserves special praise for the humanitarian assistance it\r\nhas provided to the innocent civilian population. A special\r\ntribute should be paid to the soldiers, officers, diplomats\r\nand journalists who lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\nFollowing recent developments, it appears that the\r\nsituation in the crisis areas is more balanced, politically and\r\nmilitarily, and that it offers real possibilities for solution.\r\nHowever, it is still very complex, and there is still the risk\r\nof a spill-over of the conflict to other areas — a widely\r\nheld view. In the face of this situation, we appreciate the\r\nfact that, on the initiative of the United States of America,\r\nthe international community is reviewing its stand on this\r\nconflict, including insistence on thorough implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions adopted pursuant to Chapter\r\nVII of the United Nations Charter. These provide for\r\ncontinuation of the sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs and\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, as well as the stepping up of\r\ndiplomatic activity, backed by the use of NATO military\r\nintervention when necessary.\r\nThe Republic of Albania is deeply concerned about the\r\ngrave situation in Kosova. The Serbian military and police\r\nregime that has been installed in Kosova, with the\r\nelimination of the autonomy that this federal unit of the\r\nformer Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia enjoyed,\r\nis continuing widespread terror against the Albanian\r\npopulation. The brutality of the Serbian police is evident\r\nevery day and in every part of Kosova. The apartheid\r\npolicy and practices pursued by the Serbs against the\r\nAlbanians have led to the compulsory exodus of hundreds\r\nof thousands of Albanians, mainly youngsters, to different\r\ncountries of the world. Part of this systematic terror are\r\nthe endless killings, the ransacking and the plotted\r\npolitical trials against the Albanians of Kosova.\r\nAs if this extremely tense and eruptive situation\r\nwere not enough, the Belgrade authorities are now\r\nsending to Kosova, as colonists, the Serb refugees from\r\nCroatia and Bosnia. This grave provocation, under the\r\nguise of humanism for Serb refugees, is in reality part of\r\nthe old plan of the Belgrade authorities to carry out\r\n“ethnic cleansing” in Kosova, which is inhabited to the\r\nextent of 95 per cent by Albanians, and forcefully change\r\nits ethnic-demographic composition.\r\nThe consequences of what Belgrade is doing to\r\nattain the “Greater Serbia” ambition are already common\r\nknowledge and have been internationally witnessed in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community and to concerned humanitarian\r\norganizations not to be duped by the intentions of\r\nBelgrade and not to assist it to settle the Serb refugees in\r\nKosova — an activity that falls short of being a simple\r\nhumanitarian action.\r\nWe also call upon the international community not\r\nto ignore the extremely important issue of Kosova. The\r\nBelgrade authorities have clearly challenged General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/204, the resolutions of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights in Geneva and the\r\ndecisions of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe on Kosova. If Serbia is not put\r\nunder international pressure to refrain from its policy of\r\nconfrontation in Kosova, it will not be long before\r\nanother tragedy with unpredictable consequences\r\nexplodes. The Kosova Albanian leaders have miraculously\r\nmanaged to avoid it so far through their peaceful\r\nresistance, but the question immediately arises: How long\r\nwill they be able to do so?\r\nThe Republic of Albania holds that the United\r\nNations, the major Powers and NATO should anticipate\r\nand take adequate measures in order to prevent a conflict\r\nin Kosova: demilitarize its territory; protect human and\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nnational rights of Albanians there; put an end to ethnic\r\ncleansing and Serb colonization; reopen the institutions of\r\nKosova; create a climate of dialogue between Albanians\r\nand Serbs in Kosova, and between Pristina and Belgrade;\r\nopen and continue dialogue in the presence of a third party.\r\nAlbania is of the view, and insists, that the Kosova\r\nissue be included in the agenda for discussion and solution\r\nof the problem of the former Yugoslavia. In the meantime,\r\nthe lifting of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro\r\nshould be subject to the strict condition that there should be\r\na complete and lasting solution of the Kosova issue. There\r\nis more than one problem to tackle and solve in Kosova;\r\nthey all need to be addressed properly and not overlooked.\r\nWhen we see today the progress in solving the\r\nconstitutional status of the entities in Bosnia, which we\r\nhope will be just and equitable and will satisfy all parties,\r\nwe have reason to hope and believe that the international\r\ncommunity will proceed in the right direction to solve the\r\nquestion of Kosova as well. The world is right in thinking\r\nthat, in so doing, we are respecting one of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Charter, especially the right of peoples to\r\nself-determination. The application of double standards will\r\nundoubtedly generate future conflicts.\r\nIn order for the Balkans to be an area of peace,\r\nstability and prosperity, it is necessary to bring war to an\r\nend, to bring the perpetrators of the Bosnian tragedy before\r\nthe Court and to punish them, to demilitarize over-armed\r\nStates and areas, to reconstruct what was damaged by war,\r\nto settle the Kosova issue and to thaw the already frozen\r\nbilateral relations. Internal democratization of all States, the\r\ncreation of the democratic space where Albanians live in\r\nthe Balkans, as repeatedly stated by the President of the\r\nRepublic, Sali Berisha, constitute a most positive response\r\nto any international initiative for peace and stability in the\r\nBalkans. Furthermore, transition to broad programmes of\r\ninter-Balkan and Euro-Balkan cooperation is also an\r\nabsolute requirement for development and for full\r\nintegration of the Balkans into developed and civilized\r\nEurope.\r\nIn the coming December, Albania will celebrate the\r\nfortieth anniversary of its membership in the United\r\nNations. Over all these years the Republic of Albania has\r\ndemonstrated its commitment to the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter. While the region is living through a\r\nprofound and complex crisis, Albania is testifying that it is\r\na factor of peace and stability. It has never provoked\r\nconflicts or tensions between States and has repeatedly\r\nasserted its firm stand against the forceful alteration of\r\ninternationally recognized borders. This is demonstrated\r\nfirst in its policy towards its neighbours.\r\nI am glad to declare that bilateral relations with\r\nGreece have improved following a period of tension last\r\nyear. Dialogue and good will, which Albania has always\r\nfavoured, have prevailed, and today the two countries are\r\ntaking concrete steps in the direction of extending,\r\ndeepening and speeding up cooperation in fields of\r\nmutual benefit.\r\nIt is worth mentioning here that we are glad to see\r\nthat the international community, in general, recognize the\r\ngreat improvement in the rights of the Greek minority in\r\nAlbania in the last three years. The Albanian\r\nGovernment has consistently demonstrated its willingness\r\nto ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedom for all the citizens, including members of the\r\nGreek minority, and its commitment to do so. We have\r\nalways emphasized that the Greek minority in Albania\r\nconstitutes a bridge of friendship and we are glad that this\r\nis not our view alone. There is no political reason\r\nwhatsoever that could hinder this since the realization of\r\nrights stems from our political will and from the very\r\nessence of Albanian society.\r\nAs to the right of education in one’s mother tongue,\r\nin addition to the measures already taken by the\r\nGovernment to apply international standards and fulfil its\r\ninternational commitments, such as the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, the national\r\nlegislation on education, in particular the law on private\r\nschools — which entered into force a few months ago —\r\nhas resolved this question.\r\nAlbania maintains good relations with the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and supports the full\r\nintegration of this Republic into international institutions.\r\nHowever, we encourage it to take concrete steps to\r\nimprove the situation of the Albanians there and to ensure\r\nfull respect for their human and national rights, including\r\nthe right to education in their mother tongue. This is all\r\nthe more so because of our conviction that equality\r\nbetween citizens of any nationality leads to the integration\r\nof that country and that integration is to the benefit of all\r\nthe citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and of stability in the region.\r\nAlbania does not hold a prejudiced view in its\r\nrelations with Serbia and Montenegro, either. However, it\r\nshould be said that their improvement is dependent on the\r\nrenunciation of violence against and suppression of the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nAlbanians in Kosova. Though Italy is across the sea, my\r\ncountry has considered, and considers, Italy a neighbouring\r\ncountry of great importance for bilateral relations and for\r\nthe developments in the Balkans and the Mediterranean.\r\nOur relations with this country are built on an ancient\r\ntradition and are characterized by very positive\r\ndevelopments in all fields.\r\nAlbania attaches great importance to the work with a\r\nview to the reform of the Security Council. Albania is the\r\nonly country from the Eastern European Group, except the\r\nnewly created countries in the region, that has never served\r\nin the Security Council in its course of 40 years’\r\nmembership in the Organization. We believe that the\r\nMember States, by giving Albania the first chance to sit in\r\nthe Security Council, will offer encouragement and support\r\nto the good will of the small States for active participation\r\nin multilateral cooperation in the service of international\r\npeace and security, and will show that it will not take long\r\nfor our fruitful discussions on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil to be implemented. I would like to assure you that\r\nthe election of Albania to the Security Council will be a\r\ncontribution to peace and security in the troubled region of\r\nthe Balkans as well.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express Albania’s\r\nsupport for the United Nations, its desire to strengthen the\r\nOrganization and its role in safeguarding international peace\r\nand promoting and supporting democracy, development and\r\nwell-being.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker on our list for the general\r\ndebate at this meeting. One representative has asked to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind Members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nI now call on the representative of France.\r\nMr. Ladsous (interpretation from French): Several\r\ndelegations have mentioned the question of nuclear tests\r\nand one of them did so in particularly unacceptable and\r\neven disagreeable terms. Such statements require the French\r\ndelegation to recall the facts and to place this last series of\r\ntests conducted by France in the proper context of the\r\ncomplete and final cessation of nuclear tests.\r\nThe programme of tests under way has to be seen\r\nfor what it is — that is, a conclusion. The tests will be\r\nlimited to eight at the most and will come to an end\r\nbefore the end of May 1996.\r\nOur main objective is to achieve a truly meaningful\r\ntest-ban treaty in 1996 — a treaty that will prohibit all\r\nnuclear-weapon tests and all other nuclear explosions.\r\nThat is the major problem in connection with the scope of\r\nsuch a treaty, and the Assembly is aware that on\r\n10 August 1995, in the Conference on Disarmament,\r\nFrance announced that it endorsed this objective and this\r\nformulation.\r\nThis is an extremely important choice. I repeat that\r\nif a test-ban treaty is signed in the conditions envisaged\r\nin the relevant General Assembly resolutions, France will\r\nin the future desist from all nuclear-weapons tests and all\r\nother nuclear explosions. This is the choice of the zero\r\noption, a choice that gives its full meaning to the signing\r\nof the comprehensive test-ban treaty. But to reach that\r\ngoal and to bring the negotiations to a successful\r\nconclusion, France was duty-bound, in the short period\r\nbefore the end of May 1996, to ensure for the future the\r\nreliability and safety of its weaponry. It was duty-bound\r\nto acquire an independent mastery of simulation\r\ntechniques.\r\nThis programme to complete the tests makes it\r\npossible for France to advocate the most satisfactory and\r\nthe strictest option for the test-ban treaty.\r\nSome of the attacks directed at France are\r\nunfounded, unfair and vicious. In fact, this programme of\r\ntests does not adversely affect the environment; eminent\r\ninternational scientists have demonstrated — again very\r\nrecently — that our tests are harmless. Moreover, this\r\nprogramme is in conformity with law and with the\r\ncommitments undertaken by France. Utmost restraint is\r\nnot the same thing as prohibition, and we have never\r\nruled out completing this series of tests.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 October 1995\r\nIncidentally, I should like to recall that a country that\r\ntoday described itself as our neighbour in the Pacific is\r\nreally farther away from French Polynesia than New York\r\nis from Paris.\r\nFinally, my delegation would recall that, for its part,\r\nFrance remains open to dialogue and cooperation with all\r\nStates, those of the Pacific region and all others.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
