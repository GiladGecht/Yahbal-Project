(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Obadi (Yemen),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/50/444/Add.3)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s attention to document A/50/444/Add.3.\r\nIn a letter contained in that document, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs me that since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications dated 19 and 22 September and 2 October\r\n1995, Niger has made the necessary payments to reduce its\r\narrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: The first speaker is the\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and International\r\nCooperation of Sierra Leone, His Excellency Alhaji\r\nMr. Alusine Fofanah, and I now call on him.\r\nMr. Fofanah (Sierra Leone): Permit me, first of all,\r\nto congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Indeed, as we commemorate 50 years\r\nof the existence of our Organization, his unanimous\r\nelection to preside over this Assembly is a fitting tribute\r\nto his country and an eloquent testimony to his personal\r\nexperience and skills as a seasoned diplomat. I therefore\r\nwant to assure him of my delegation’s fullest cooperation\r\nas he directs and guides our deliberations on this historic\r\noccasion, and to wish him every success in that\r\nendeavour.\r\nTo his immediate predecessor, and our esteemed\r\nBrother, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, I convey my delegation’s gratitude and\r\nappreciation for the exemplary manner in which he\r\nconducted the affairs of the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI would also like to thank our eminent Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his bold\r\ninitiatives and his firm guidance of the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe world has come a long way from 26 June 1945,\r\nwhen 50 States appended their signatures to the Charter\r\ndocument, creating this enduring body. In spite of the\r\nundoubted advancement of science and technology, and\r\nindeed the enormous strides made by the Organization\r\nduring the past 50 years, the world continues, alas, to be\r\ngripped by the same age-old problems of poverty,\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\ndisarmament, maintenance of peace and security,\r\ndevelopment and many more.\r\nCertainly, on the economic front there is no cause for\r\ncomfort or complacency. Most developing countries,\r\nespecially the least developed, continue to be strangled by\r\nnegative economic trends, stagnating resource flows,\r\nseemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings, rising\r\nunemployment and, above all, the phenomenal increase in\r\nthe number of people living in absolute poverty, occasioned\r\nlargely by wars, famine, drought and the heavy burden of\r\nforeign debts.\r\nThe debt burden, in particular, continues to be\r\nexcessive and harmful to the sustainable development of\r\ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed among\r\nthem. In this connection, the initiative of the British\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer earlier this year to put in place\r\nmeasures to help reduce the stock of multilateral debt of the\r\nmost indebted developing nations is a step in the right\r\ndirection. Nevertheless, we continue to hold the view that\r\nunless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the\r\ninternational community, no meaningful progress for the\r\nnext 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future\r\nby the developing countries, especially the least developed\r\namong them.\r\nWe believe that a permanent and definitive\r\ncomprehensive solution to the debt problem must be found\r\nwithout further delay. That is why we commend the current\r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, His Excellency\r\nPresident Soeharto of Indonesia, for his initiative in\r\nconvening in August last year a Ministerial Meeting of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries on the subject of debt and\r\ndevelopment with the theme “Sharing of Experiences”, at\r\nwhich a number of general principles for debt reduction\r\nwere adopted, marking significant progress in the search for\r\na lasting solution to this nagging problem.\r\nWe continue to appeal to the international community,\r\nparticularly to the international financial institutions, to give\r\nthose modest recommendations serious consideration in the\r\nformulation of policies and actions on the debt issue.\r\nThe persistence of these problems has undermined\r\npolitical stability and threatened regional and international\r\npeace and security. Determined as we in the developing\r\ncountries have been to improve the lot of our people and to\r\nredress the economic plight facing our various countries, we\r\nstill labour under excruciating circumstances. It is now\r\nabundantly clear that the developing countries cannot go it\r\nalone. We need the involvement of other, dependable,\r\npartners, particularly among the developed countries and\r\nthe major international financial institutions. Additional\r\nresources at multilateral and bilateral levels are essential\r\nfrom these partners to achieve rapid improvement in the\r\nlives of the millions of our affected people.\r\nAs for Sierra Leone, since April 1992, when the\r\nNational Provisional Ruling Council took over the reins\r\nof government, we have set for ourselves the task of\r\nimplementing anti-poverty programmes and socio-\r\neconomic reforms, including deregulation of prices,\r\nexchange control and interest rates, and the reduction of\r\nfiscal deficit.\r\nDespite the limited scope of the success attained so\r\nfar, we are determined not to relent in our efforts to cater\r\nfor the special needs of the most vulnerable groups in\r\nsociety.\r\nCalling upon the international community to pay\r\nspecial attention to the problems of developing countries\r\nby providing them with financial and technical support\r\nshould not be considered as an appeal simply for charity\r\nbut rather an investment in the future development and\r\nwell-being of mankind. Indeed, we realize that the key to\r\nsustainable development in any State is in the hands of its\r\ncitizenry. Developing countries are now very much aware\r\nof this and are taking responsibility for working towards\r\nimproving the lot of the peoples of their respective\r\ncountries.\r\nIndeed, during the 50 years of its existence, the\r\nUnited Nations has also been studying ways and means of\r\nimproving the economies of the developing countries of\r\nthe world. None the less, as our export prices have been\r\non the decline, our economic plans have remained\r\nunfulfilled and the rate of growth of our gross domestic\r\nproduct, which was never fast, is in great danger of\r\nslowing down to a complete standstill. The technical\r\nassistance schemes which have been formulated to study\r\nthe problem are numerous. My delegation firmly believes\r\nthat the time has now come for positive action that would\r\nlead to the eradication of the largely known causes of\r\neconomic stagnation, particularly in Africa. We call for a\r\nspeedy implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s as\r\nwell as for the consolidation of efforts towards the\r\ndiversification of the African economies.\r\nIn a world of growing interdependence, the\r\nliberalization of trade, the globalization of the economy\r\nand increasing regional integration, sustainable\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty cannot be\r\nensured in the absence of peace and stability. “An Agenda\r\nfor Peace” and “An Agenda for Development” not only\r\nshow that peace and development are inseparable and\r\nindivisible but rather that they contain the essential\r\ningredients of a new vision of our one world. No\r\ndevelopment is possible anywhere, save in an environment\r\nthat is peaceful, stable and secure. This holds true for\r\nnational development, as it does for regional and\r\ninternational cooperation. That is why we in Sierra Leone\r\nhave always believed that peace at home is incomplete\r\nunless our neighbours enjoy peace too. Today, more than\r\never before, we should all be aware that we are our\r\nbrother’s keeper and that we can no longer afford to be\r\nindifferent to developments in any part of the globe.\r\nThree years ago, my Head of State, Captain Valentine\r\nE. M. Strasser, acquainted this body with the devastation\r\nvisited on Sierra Leone initially as a spillover from the civil\r\nwar in Liberia. He explained to this Assembly the pain and\r\nthe agony that our people have had to endure as a result of\r\nthat conflict and its ramifications for regional peace and\r\nstability.\r\nRegrettably, I am again constrained to inform you that\r\nthe conflict has persisted and that the lives of many\r\ninnocent Sierra Leoneans continue to be lost. In spite of my\r\nGovernment’s repeated overtures for peace and\r\nreconciliation there is as yet no let-up in the fighting on the\r\nground and the rebel attacks against innocent and\r\nunsuspecting civilians in provincial cities and several towns\r\nand villages in the country continue unabated.\r\nConsequently, we are witnessing today the internal\r\ndisplacement of hundreds of thousands of our people and\r\nthousands more have had to seek refugee status in\r\nneighbouring countries, not to mention the devastation\r\ncaused to the national economy.\r\nWhat all this means is that the Liberian situation is\r\ninextricably linked with the situation in Sierra Leone. It is\r\ntherefore our ardent hope that with the budding peace in\r\nLiberia, Sierra Leoneans can realistically expect a lull in the\r\nfighting on their own soil to enable them embark on\r\neconomic reconstruction and rehabilitation. We would, in\r\nthis regard, like to express our profound thanks and\r\nappreciation to the West African leaders who have made\r\nthe success achieved in Liberia possible. The leadership of\r\nNigeria, Ghana and the countries contributing to the\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) deserve\r\nspecial commendation. So do the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), organizations which\r\nin their own diverse ways, have contributed to the\r\npeaceful developments in Liberia.\r\nWe therefore call upon this Organization and all\r\npeace-loving people the world over to support the new\r\ngovernment in Liberia. At the same time, we would\r\nfervently appeal to the Liberian people to rise to the\r\noccasion, for in the final analysis, it must be Liberians\r\nthemselves who should find a lasting solution to their\r\nproblems. We wish the New Liberian Council of State\r\nand the people of Liberia success in their search for\r\ndurable peace in their country, for we believe that such\r\nsuccess will have a positive impact on Sierra Leone.\r\nThe need to strengthen the peace momentum in\r\nLiberia is particularly important because during the\r\ndisarmament process there are going to be thousands of\r\nhardened former combatants, some of them probably still\r\narmed, who might be tempted to relocate the theatre of\r\nwar unless they are effectively disarmed, brought under\r\ncontrol and suitably reintegrated into Liberian society.\r\nClosely linked to the search for peace in Sierra\r\nLeone is the implementation of the programme of\r\ndemocratization announced by my Head of State, His\r\nExcellency Captain Valentine E. M. Strasser, three years\r\nago for the return of Sierra Leone to multiparty civilian\r\nrule. I am happy to report that this programme is still on\r\ncourse, despite the unavoidable delays resulting from the\r\nrebel war. The ban on political parties has now been\r\nlifted and indeed the registration of political parties\r\ncompleted. A National Consultative Conference convened\r\nby the Interim National Electoral Commission was held\r\nin mid-August to seek national consensus on how\r\nelections could be conducted in a war situation and to\r\ndiscuss some other related issues. At that Conference, it\r\nwas agreed that both presidential and parliamentary\r\nelections will be held not later than in February 1996. The\r\nRevolutionary United Front, the rebel faction, was invited\r\nto participate in that political process, but unfortunately,\r\ntheir response, as has consistently been the case, was\r\nnegative. Yet, in spite of this, we continue to persist in\r\npursuing peace and continue to state clearly that the peace\r\noption is still on the table. Be that as it may, I should also\r\nstate that as a responsible Government, we cannot give up\r\nthe armed struggle, if only out of the sense of legitimate\r\nobligation to protect the lives and properties of innocent\r\nSierra Leoneans, who have borne a large measure of the\r\nbrunt of our senseless rebel war.\r\nAt this juncture, my delegation would like to express\r\nits appreciation to this Organization, to the OAU and to\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nthe Commonwealth for responding positively to our request\r\nfor help by way of exploratory fact-finding missions to\r\nSierra Leone. In the case of the United Nations, the\r\nSecretary-General subsequently sent a resident Special\r\nEnvoy in the person of Ambassador Berhanu Dinka, who\r\nis still in the country offering assistance. It is an\r\nencouraging sign that the international community, through\r\nthe United Nations, the OAU and the Commonwealth, is\r\njust as anxious as the National Provisional Ruling Council\r\nGovernment to see an early end to our destructive war so\r\nthat our peaceful citizens may once again be able to live in\r\nan environment free of fear and anxiety and to engage in\r\ntheir ordinary daily pursuits. At the same time, while\r\nappealing to the international community to help us with\r\nlogistical, financial and related support in the\r\nimplementation of our political programme, we will also\r\nrequire similar assistance, at the appropriate time, in\r\nrebuilding and rehabilitating our devastated economy. In\r\nthis connection, we would like to express our deep and\r\nsincere appreciation to all friendly Governments,\r\nparticularly Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana for their assistance\r\nin our trying moments.\r\nThe world-wide problem of refugees and displaced\r\npersons continues to be our concern, particularly as we\r\nourselves have become victims of this scourge. More than\r\nhalf a million of our citizens have become displaced in\r\nSierra Leone, and hundreds of thousands more are refugees\r\nin neighbouring countries. The yearning of all these people\r\nis for an opportunity to finally return to their homes, settle\r\ndown and rebuild their lives. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to urgently help us bring our people back home.\r\nThe use of narcotic drugs has for some time now been\r\na source of concern, mainly to developing countries,\r\nbecause of the inherent danger it poses to society,\r\nespecially the young. Today, no country can claim to be\r\ninsulated from this scourge, as it is now a global\r\nphenomenon. The abuse of drugs and drug-related\r\nsubstances is gaining in prominence, not only in Sierra\r\nLeone, but in the whole West African subregion, and there\r\nis no doubt that with the prevalence of rebel wars it will\r\ncontinue to plague us long after these wars are over,\r\nthereby threatening social peace and stability in the\r\ncountries concerned.\r\nThe Government of Sierra Leone is determined to take\r\nall necessary measures against drug abuse and illicit\r\ntrafficking domestically, as well as through subregional and\r\ninternational cooperation. To this end, my Government has\r\nratified the 1961, 1971 and 1988 Conventions dealing with\r\nillicit drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, and has set up\r\nboth inter-ministerial and technical committees comprising\r\nall relevant sectoral departments to advise the\r\nGovernment on effective measures to contain drug abuse\r\nand other related ills.\r\nNo one can deny that the threat of global nuclear\r\ndestruction posed by the cold war has receded. However,\r\nit is becoming increasingly clear to us that where one\r\ntype of peril has been combated others are swiftly arising\r\nto take its place. Today, the breakdown of bipolar control\r\nhas lifted restrictions on long- simmering civic, ethnic and\r\nterritorial disputes. Violence has brought the very\r\nexistence of some States into question and, with it, gross\r\nviolations of human rights, including instances of\r\ngenocide exceeded only, perhaps, by those of the Second\r\nWorld War. Conflicts are becoming more numerous and\r\nmore complex, and are scattered all over the globe, even\r\nas there are glimmers of hope.\r\nIn Africa, for example, we welcome the recent\r\ndevelopments whereby both parties in the Angolan\r\nconflict are moving towards allowing the will of the\r\nAngolan people finally to prevail over the barrel of the\r\ngun. My delegation also notes with satisfaction the\r\nagreement by UNITA to join with the MPLA in a\r\ngovernment of national unity. In like manner, the\r\nacceptance by the Mozambican opposition leader,\r\nComrade Afonso Dhlakama, and his men of the outcome\r\nof the electoral process should be a source of relief to all\r\nAfricans and peace-loving people everywhere. It is our\r\nfervent hope that the Mozambicans will emulate the\r\nexample of their neighbours in Zimbabwe, South Africa\r\nand Namibia — societies which have shown that, with the\r\nright political attitude and good will, it is quite possible\r\nto replace strife with reconciliation and hatred with\r\naccommodation.\r\nIn the Middle East, we view the developments that\r\nstarted a few years ago with the mutual recognition of the\r\nPLO and Israel, followed later by the signing of the\r\nWashington Declaration between Jordan and Israel, which\r\nended the state of war between them, as extremely\r\nimportant positive steps towards the full realization of\r\npeace in that region. In like manner, we welcome the just-\r\nconcluded Interim Agreement on Jericho and the West\r\nBank, signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington.\r\nIn the same vein, we commend Norway, the United\r\nStates, Egypt and all those others that in one way or the\r\nother have played, and are continuing to play, a role in\r\nmoving this historic conflict towards a peaceful\r\nresolution.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nOn the other aspect of the Middle Eastern equation,\r\nwe urge Israel, Syria and Lebanon to join fully in the\r\nhistoric peace process and display a spirit of\r\naccommodation, in the interest of all the people of the\r\nMiddle East and mankind as a whole.\r\nWith regard to the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq,\r\nwe call upon Iraq fully to respect the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait, in accordance with the terms\r\nof the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nHowever, we call upon the international community, in\r\napplying sanctions against Iraq, not to lose sight of the\r\nsuffering being experienced by the innocent civilians of that\r\ncountry.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the decision to extend\r\nindefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), a decision which my country co-\r\nsponsored. It was indeed a decision of momentous\r\nimportance, which heralded what has been described as a\r\nmajor success of the United Nations in the field of\r\ndisarmament. However, we are disappointed that indications\r\nsince the extension are that final agreement on an\r\nimmediate and comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty seems\r\nuncertain. If humanity is to maintain any lasting hope for\r\nthe future, we must act now with courage and decisiveness\r\nto achieve a nuclear-free world. In this regard, we call\r\nunequivocally for the cessation of nuclear tests of any kind\r\nin all environments, and call upon the Conference on\r\nDisarmament to work towards the speedy conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty within the shortest possible\r\ntime.\r\nInternational peace can hardly be maintained in a\r\nworld in which some men are free while others are under\r\nthe yoke of colonialism. Being fully aware of that problem\r\nand imbued with the idealism that brought this Organization\r\ninto being, Member States solemnly resolved to remove any\r\nvestiges of colonialism from the world. This line of\r\nthinking achieved full stature at the United Nations in 1960,\r\nwhen the landmark resolution 1514 (XV), incorporating the\r\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial\r\nCountries and Peoples, was adopted.\r\nToday, as the world celebrates the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof our Organization, its considerable success in the field of\r\ndecolonization is universally acclaimed. We remember the\r\nhistory of the struggle against colonialism and pay tribute\r\nto all those who were part of that struggle. We remain\r\nmindful of the sacrifices that made it possible for hundreds\r\nof millions of people to achieve self-determination and\r\nindependence. We commend the work of the Special\r\nCommittee of 24 for its effective contribution to the\r\napplication of the Declaration on the Granting of\r\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. My\r\ncountry has had the honour of serving that Committee —\r\nit is, in fact, currently chairing it — and we are proud to\r\nhave been able to make some contribution to its work and\r\nto bringing freedom to a good portion of the human race.\r\nIn that regard, while we welcome with profound\r\npleasure the State of Palau to this world Organization as\r\nthe 185th Member, it is my delegation’s view that the\r\ntask of decolonization remains unfinished. Further\r\nconcerted and determined action is still required on the\r\npart of all involved to win freedom for people who are\r\nstill unable to exercise their right to self-determination —\r\nmostly peoples of small island States, located mainly in\r\nthe Pacific and Caribbean regions. These territories are\r\nconfronted with unique problems that require new and\r\ninnovative solutions geared towards the implementation of\r\nthe International Decade for the Eradication of\r\nColonialism by the Year 2000, launched by the General\r\nAssembly in 1988.\r\nWe believe that the situation of these Territories\r\nshould not be seen as an impediment to the application of\r\nthe principle of self-determination. The wishes of the\r\npeople of the Non-Self-Governing Territories are what\r\ncount most. We appeal for the strengthened and continued\r\nsupport of the administering Powers, whose cooperation\r\nwith the Special Committee is essential for the progress\r\nof the Territories towards self-determination. We count on\r\nthe support of the specialized agencies and the\r\ninternational community as a whole to continue to assist\r\nthe Non-Self-Governing Territories in enhancing their\r\nstandard of living and promoting their self-sufficiency.\r\nWe also truly believe that our combined and unrelenting\r\nefforts will ensure the fulfilment of the promise of\r\nfreedom, lasting peace, sustained growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all the people of our planet in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the successful outcome of\r\nthe Conference on the Environment and Development in\r\n1992, the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993,\r\nthe International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment in 1994, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment convened in Copenhagen in 1995 and the\r\nrecently concluded United Nations Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing. Referring to the\r\nBeijing Conference, we note with satisfaction that the\r\nhistory of the United Nations for the past 50 years has\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nalso been one of steady progress for women, from a drive\r\nfor their civil and political rights to their recognition as\r\nequal partners in the broader societal context.\r\nWe appeal for the urgent implementation of the\r\nrecommendations, conclusions and decisions adopted in\r\nthese various international Conferences. We believe that in\r\ntheir realization partly lies the possibility of lasting peace\r\nand security, economic progress and social emancipation for\r\nall humankind.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the positive role played by\r\nour Organization in facilitating international agreement on\r\nthorny issues, whose resolution would certainly have been\r\nmore difficult, if not impossible, in other forums. In this\r\nconnection, my delegation welcomes the new Agreements\r\nsigned at Marrakesh in April last year, establishing the\r\nWorld Trade Organization. However, we stress the need for\r\na continuous assessment of its likely impact on developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed among them. We\r\nfear that countries which are net importers of food, such as\r\nSierra Leone, might face the prospect of higher food import\r\nbills arising from the liberalization of trade in the\r\nagricultural sector. Other areas in the Agreements which\r\nopen up competition between developed and developing\r\ncountries also need to be constantly reviewed to ensure that\r\nthe latter do not suffer unduly.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, it has become\r\nincreasingly clear that the United Nations is finding it\r\ndifficult to deal with the challenges of the post-cold-war\r\nera. As we enter the next millennium, we believe it should\r\nbe a strong, revitalized, effective and purposeful United\r\nNations, able to play its full role as envisaged in its\r\nCharter.\r\nWith democracy taking root among nations, logic and\r\ncommon sense dictate that decisions of the United Nations\r\nshould also carry the necessary imprint of the collective\r\nwill of its Members. Indeed, the Security Council, which is\r\ncharged with the primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, should be perceived as\r\nlegitimate in its decision-making process. My delegation\r\ntakes the view that a more efficient, transparent and\r\ndemocratic Security Council, embracing the views of a\r\nwider sector of the international community, could stand it\r\nin good stead to deal with the challenges of the next\r\nmillennium — challenges which touch humanity generally,\r\nrather than individual States which often lack the capacity\r\nand the ability to handle them successfully. Such challenges\r\ninclude the problem of drugs, devastating diseases like\r\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), money\r\nlaundering, poverty and many more yet unknown. We\r\nsincerely hope that the final outcome of the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on institutional reforms will\r\nadequately address these concerns and offer appropriately\r\nbold suggestions and solutions.\r\nThe relevance of the United Nations after 50 years\r\nas an instrument for the peaceful existence and orderly\r\ndevelopment of every nation no longer requires\r\njustification. We commend the Secretary-General and the\r\nSecretariat for initiating a restructuring process which will\r\nultimately ensure the enhanced viability and efficiency of\r\nour Organization. We also pay tribute to all their\r\npredecessors whose own efforts contributed to the\r\nsurvival of the Organization. Member States owe it to\r\nposterity to adopt a firm commitment to the provisions of\r\nthe Charter and not to undermine the credibility of our\r\ncommon Organization. We renew our call for all Member\r\nStates to be resolute and uncompromising in the quest for\r\nglobal peace, security and social and economic justice as\r\nwe move into the twenty-first century. Let me, in\r\nconclusion, reaffirm my country’s commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and dedication to the principles\r\nwhich undergird our Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai.\r\nMr. Ghafoorzai (Afghanistan): On the eve of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the\r\nrepresentatives of the world’s nations are gathered here\r\nwith hearts full of hope for a better future, as well as for\r\nthe cause of the peace and prosperity of mankind, in an\r\natmosphere of great enthusiasm and animation.\r\nThe Afghan nation, in spite of the immense\r\ndifficulties it has encountered, shares that optimism with\r\nmany of the nations represented here, as well as\r\nconfidence in its ability to overcome those challenges.\r\nWar and conflict always bring with them miseries\r\nand devastation. The last 17 years have taught our\r\nchildren only to differentiate the various sounds of guns,\r\nrockets, tanks and mortars, rather than teaching them\r\nliteracy or providing them with basic nutrition, security\r\nand peace of mind.\r\nWe turn to this world family, as an institution\r\ndedicated to the cause of humanity, the self-determination\r\nof nations, human rights and democracy, to pronounce\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nitself opposed to the forces aiming to create a bloodbath in\r\nan already devastated Afghanistan.\r\nWhen I return to my homeland — the home of 1.7\r\nmillion martyr graves, tens of millions of unexploded land-\r\nmines, 2 million disabled people, hundreds of thousands of\r\norphans and widows — I am expected to be carrying\r\nanswers as to why this world, which claims to be\r\ncommitted to human rights and justice, has remained a\r\nspectator of the sufferings of Afghans, brought about by\r\nforeign interference. Why, in spite of the complete peace,\r\nsecurity and tranquillity prevailing in the capital for many\r\nmonths past, have the United Nations offices unjustifiably\r\nabandoned us by remaining outside?\r\nOur people find it astonishing that in an era of such\r\ndeveloped mass communication, which leaves no distance\r\nbetween different corners of the globe, the apparently\r\ninsurmountable difficulties — in particular, the actual\r\ncauses of the continuing imposed war — are not\r\nunderstood. I am confident that there are people who\r\nclearly see the factors contributing to the continuation of\r\nthe conflict. There are forces that insist on seeing our\r\npolitical system subordinated to their political and economic\r\ndesigns and policies. This is the actual source of the\r\nconflict.\r\nThe crisis in Afghanistan is often perceived as a\r\nsubject of academic studies. Some call this a civil war in a\r\nsociety that they consider “fragmented”. Others look at it as\r\nthe scene of a contest, a struggle for power. Yet others try\r\nto find the roots of the conflict in the ethnic and tribal\r\ncomposition of the country. The truth is far more clear:\r\nwhatever it is, it is not a civil war; nor is it a tribal or\r\nethnic conflict; it is an imposed war.\r\nWe have learned from history that our existence\r\ndepends on our unity. We, like many other nations, want to\r\nlive in peace and security, as well as benefit from economic\r\ndevelopment, welfare and democracy, which will be\r\navailable only in peaceful circumstances. We want to live\r\nin peace with our neighbours and to engage in good-\r\nneighbourly relations. We leave it up to the astute observers\r\nof the United Nations and the impartial analysts of the\r\nworld community to judge the efficacy of the United\r\nNations in alleviating the sufferings in Afghanistan.\r\nThe year 1995 opened with good omens for\r\nAfghanistan. The country witnessed positive changes\r\ntowards peace and political stability. Following the removal\r\nof the sources of danger from the southern part of the\r\ncapital, the people of Kabul found a moment of peace after\r\nyears of being rocketed indiscriminately. Every day since\r\nmid-March an average of about 3,500 refugees\r\nreturned home — mostly to the capital — according to\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR). Prices fell sharply. Goods and\r\nservices became plentiful in the markets. The Government\r\nreopened 156 schools for girls and boys, and the\r\nuniversities reopened in an atmosphere of security and\r\npeace.\r\nOfficial delegations from the United States,\r\nSwitzerland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan,\r\nSaudi Arabia, Turkey, Tajikistan, the Russian Federation,\r\nUzbekistan, the People’s Republic of China and the\r\nSudan, as well as many international organizations and\r\nothers, came to Kabul. High-ranking Afghan delegations\r\nalso travelled abroad.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan even won an\r\nopportunity to take steps towards peace and regional\r\nsecurity. Among the Tajikistan peace mediators, Professor\r\nBurhan-ud-din Rabbani, the President of the Islamic State\r\nof Afghanistan, accomplished the most. We remember\r\nthat his peace initiative conduced to unprecedented and\r\npositive changes regarding the civil strife in Tajikistan.\r\nKabul city, for the first time, hosted direct talks between\r\nHis Excellency Imam Ali Rakhmanov, the President of\r\nTajikistan, and Sayed Abdullah Nouri, the leader of the\r\nIslamic Revival Movement, representing all the Tajik\r\nopposition. In a historic press conference the two leaders\r\nembraced each other and agreed on a longer-term cease-\r\nfire.\r\nConfidence-building measures were taken on the\r\nbasis of domestic endeavours between Afghanistan and\r\nthe opposition. The Islamic State of Afghanistan, with the\r\naim of putting an end to all problems in the country,\r\npresented to the United Nations a peace plan, on most of\r\nwhose items there emerged, for the first time, a sense of\r\nagreement among all sides. The plan pledged to the nation\r\nthe convening of a Grand National Assembly — Loya\r\nJirga, as we call it — within a year. The Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan, while leaving to the United Nations Special\r\nMission the question of the creation of an appropriate\r\nmechanism for the convening of the Grand National\r\nAssembly, promised to agree to the participation of the\r\nopposition groups in the current Supreme State Council\r\nand in the present one-year-term transitional Government\r\nuntil the convening of the Grand National Assembly.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nAs a result of these proposals the people of our\r\ncountry and of the region felt more optimistic about the\r\nreturn of peace to Afghanistan. However, those needlessly\r\nafraid of an independent, stable and self-reliant Afghanistan\r\nsought to change the course of events to coincide with their\r\nown interests. They once again used the made-up Taliban\r\ngroup — whose actual identity and character and the\r\nsources of whose funding and arming are yet to be made\r\nknown to most of the members in this Hall — equipped\r\nwith arms, light and heavy, from across the border of our\r\ncountry and with air power. Ironically enough, they recently\r\nchose to target the west of Afghanistan, which, according\r\nto earlier statements of Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri,\r\nhead of the United Nation Special Mission to Afghanistan,\r\nwas the best model of healthy administration, order,\r\nstability and people’s welfare.\r\nIntent on exposing the Islamic State to instability,\r\nmilitary intelligence services across the border tried hard to\r\nunite the opponents of the State under a single command.\r\nThey boosted the Taliban mercenaries with their own\r\nfrontier militia. Thousands of those being trained across\r\nAfghan borders launched attacks against the Shindand air\r\nbase and a number of other western provinces of the\r\ncountry, including Herat, as a result of which the peaceful\r\ncity of Herat was on 5 September turned into a place of\r\noccupation, chaos and insecurity. A great number of\r\ncivilians lost their lives. Tens of thousands were forced to\r\nleave their houses. The bands of the so-called Taliban, or\r\nreligious students, began their rule by closing schools for\r\ngirls and the universities, as well as banning women from\r\nworking in offices or teaching in schools. They have even\r\nforbidden the use of televisions and videos, and all movie\r\ntheatres are closed down in the areas under their\r\noccupation.\r\nAs the so-called Taliban are said to have the capability\r\nof jeopardizing any viable peace process in the country, I\r\ndeem it necessary to register some basic facts about this\r\nmysterious movement.\r\nIn Islamic countries there are many religious schools\r\nor “Madrasas” where several subjects related to Islam are\r\ntaught. The purpose of these schools is to prepare Muslim\r\nyouth for religious service to their countrymen. In no\r\n“Madrasa” in the world is the subject of modern warfare,\r\nsuch as the use of artillery and rockets, or the flying of\r\nwarplanes, taught. That is the work of military academies.\r\nThe only modern items the Taliban mercenaries are\r\naware of are advanced armaments. As for their links with\r\nthe outside, the most pertinent and very important question\r\nis: if their numbers are about 30,000, as they claim, and\r\neach of them would require $100 for daily and military\r\nexpenses, who is paying the more than $88 million a\r\nmonth for their expenses?\r\nAs for logistical support, for instance, it is calculated\r\nthat in order for the Taliban to keep their transport\r\nvehicles, tanks and other armoured vehicles running they\r\nneed more than 15,000 gallons of fuel each day. That is\r\nseparate from almost the same amount of fuel that they\r\nrequire as reserve. Again, who is providing them with\r\nsuch huge logistical support?\r\nThe Taliban have no single leader. They claim to\r\nhave a Central Council in Kandahar. However, no\r\nplatform or political agenda has been made known yet.\r\nThe declarations of their many leaders are not consistent.\r\nOn 20 September one of their leaders, Mullah Mishr, told\r\nPeter Greste, a correspondent of the Reuters news agency,\r\nthat the problem of Afghanistan could only be solved\r\nthrough war.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan expressed the\r\nintense indignation of its people and Government in its\r\nletters of 5 September 1995 (S/1995/767) and 14\r\nSeptember 1995 (S/1995/795) addressed to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, calling for immediate measures to end the state\r\nof occupation in western Afghanistan. We specifically\r\nrequested the United Nations to send a fact-finding\r\nmission to the western part of the country to investigate\r\nand assess the reality of the state of occupation. That is\r\nthe responsibility of the Security Council.\r\nThe resistance of our people together with the forces\r\nof the Islamic State of Afghanistan, against the\r\nmercenaries and foreign militia, has been further\r\nstrengthened. As a result, the Province of Ghowr, east of\r\nHerat, once occupied, has been liberated. The foreign\r\narmed intervention, however, reached a new dimension.\r\nThe bands of mercenaries were reinforced west of Kabul\r\nto attack the capital, the plan of attack being engineered\r\nand guided from abroad.\r\nWe strongly demand that the United Nations Special\r\nMission break its silence regarding those mercenaries and\r\nanswer the relevant questions, including whether this band\r\nis a threat to peace. This is particularly pertinent because\r\nthe Special Mission once considered the Taliban to be a\r\npositive factor for peace. Is it not time for the Special\r\nMission to find out the intentions of the Taliban in\r\nrelation to General Assembly resolutions on Afghanistan?\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nMr. Odlum (Saint Lucia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nEvents have proved that the United Nations Special\r\nMission encountered many difficulties and challenges,\r\nowing to the lack of an adequate capability to carry out the\r\nmandate entrusted to it by General Assembly resolutions\r\n48/208 and 49/140. To enhance the capabilities of the\r\nSpecial Mission, the Islamic State of Afghanistan submits\r\nthe following five-point proposal.\r\nFirst, the necessity to reinforce the Mission requires\r\nthe formation of a contact group on Afghanistan to speed\r\nup the peace process. The contact group on Afghanistan\r\nshould be composed of one representative of the United\r\nNations Special Mission; one representative of the\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, which is already active in the peace process in\r\nAfghanistan; one representative from among the member\r\nStates of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, but\r\nnot a country directly involved; one representative from\r\namong the members of the European Union; and one\r\nrepresentative from among the members of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\nSecondly, the contact group would promote the peace\r\nprocess in Afghanistan by focusing its endeavours in the\r\nlight of information, evidence and documents provided to\r\nthe Special Mission pertaining to the violation of the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.\r\nThirdly, the contact group on Afghanistan would\r\nsearch for ways and means to end foreign intervention and\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, and make\r\neffective and appropriate recommendations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and to the Security Council.\r\nFourthly, the various proposed programmes to bring\r\npeace to Afghanistan should be studied by the contact\r\ngroup in consultation with the involved Afghan parties.\r\nThese endeavours would have the following objectives:\r\nCreation of a commission for the convening of the\r\nGrand National Assembly, or “Loya Jirga”; this\r\ncommission would also have the mandate to draft the\r\nConstitution, to include a firm disposition guaranteeing\r\ndemocracy and human rights for the future\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nConvening of the Grand National Assembly, or “Loya\r\nJirga”, within one year.\r\nElection of the future leader of Afghanistan for a\r\nsubsequent fixed term of office.\r\nAdoption of the Constitution.\r\nFormation of the first parliament from among the\r\nmembers of the Grand National Assembly, which\r\ncould represent the administrative units of the\r\ncountry on the basis of their proportion of\r\npopulation.\r\nFifthly, the contact group on Afghanistan would\r\nimmediately approach all Afghan groups and invite them\r\nto participate in the Supreme State Council and\r\nGovernment, until the formation of the Grand National\r\nAssembly, or “Loya Jirga”.\r\nThe contact group on Afghanistan would also play\r\na crucial role in the reconstruction of the country, as\r\nrequired by General Assembly resolution 49/140, adopted\r\non 20 December 1994.\r\nWe consider that proposal, which has already been\r\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nto be a secure and short path towards peace, national\r\nrapprochement and stability, through the cessation of\r\nhostilities.\r\nTo those who refuse to accept the one-year lapse of\r\ntime for that peace process, insisting on an unconditional\r\nand immediate transfer of power, we say that a period of\r\none year is not long in the life of a nation. Had there\r\nbeen an agreement a year ago for the transfer of power\r\nand for the consolidation of the political process, we\r\nwould by now have been in the process of transferring\r\npower.\r\nWe solemnly ask the General Assembly to take this\r\nproposal into consideration when discussing the agenda\r\nitem on Afghanistan during this historic fiftieth session.\r\nHaving said this, we would like to state — for those\r\nwho insist on the need for a military solution to the\r\nproblem — that the Islamic State of Afghanistan, while\r\nwilling to transfer power to a legitimate and lawful\r\nauthority, has the capacity and capability to respond to the\r\nterrorist acts of mercenaries linked to foreign quarters.\r\nAfghanistan would not allow any circles to\r\nundermine the process of the peaceful transfer of power\r\nand the normal political process that is to be implemented\r\nunder the supervision of the United Nations and the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Those cliques of\r\noutsiders who are recruiting, training, arming, and providing\r\nfinancial assistance to the mercenaries — as well as\r\nreinforcing them with their own militia — and using such\r\nreactionary groups to destabilize a moderate Islamic system\r\nwhich believes in democracy and human rights, are wrong\r\nin their assessments and calculations. Such foreign circles\r\nmay think that after the usurpation of power by the Taliban\r\nall will go well for them. In fact, they will add a further\r\nproblem, especially by bringing onto the scene a faction\r\nwhich has no factual presence on Afghanistan’s political\r\nscene. These circles should be aware that the peace and\r\nsecurity in the capital, the actual relative peace and stability\r\nin the country and in the region, would be jeopardized by\r\nsuch an erroneous miscalculation. The same error was made\r\nby the former Soviet Union in 1979.\r\nFor the record, we would like to emphasize that those\r\nwho ignite a fire in our country will burn themselves. It\r\nwould then be too late to return to the peaceful political\r\nprocess on which we are now trying to embark.\r\nThe statement made by His Excellency the Foreign\r\nMinister of Pakistan on 27 September 1995 before this\r\nAssembly pertaining to the relation between Afghanistan\r\nand Pakistan was itself a clear illustration of his\r\nGovernment’s unfriendly intentions towards my country.\r\nThe assertions of His Excellency the Foreign Minister of\r\nPakistan, as contained in his statement, need to be\r\nresponded to for the sake of the record.\r\nFirst, the Pakistani Foreign Minister was trying to\r\nconfuse our friends and to divert the attention of world\r\npublic opinion from his country’s own acts of blatant\r\ninterference in Afghanistan and from the invasion by its\r\nmilitia in assisting the so-called Taliban in Western\r\nAfghanistan to the tragic incident in the Pakistani Embassy\r\nat Kabul.\r\nIn this regard the following explanations are necessary.\r\nI express, on behalf of His Excellency the President and the\r\nGovernment and the people of Afghanistan, profound regret\r\nabout the very sad and grievous incident that occurred in\r\nthe Embassy of Pakistan at Kabul on 6 September 1995.\r\nThis message has also been forwarded by an official note\r\nof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan to the\r\nForeign Ministry of Pakistan. Furthermore, I have conveyed\r\ntwo messages by telephone from Kabul to His Excellency\r\nMr. Najmuddin Sheikh, Foreign Secretary of Pakistan.\r\nThe tragic incident contradicts the traditional\r\nhospitality of the Afghan people. While we express our\r\ngrief at the incident, which we consider unjustifiable, at\r\nthe same time we say that some aspects of the events\r\nhave been overlooked by the Foreign Minister of\r\nPakistan, whose Government tried to use different forums\r\nfor political gains through a distortion of the facts.\r\nAllow me, for the sake of the record, to point out\r\nthe sequence of incidents as they occurred. On 6\r\nSeptember 1995, on the morrow of the occupation of\r\nHerat City by the so-called Taliban mercenaries, with the\r\nhelp of foreign militias, the people of Kabul held a\r\npeaceful demonstration. Tens of thousands of peaceful\r\ndemonstrators gathered outside the compound of the\r\nEmbassy of Pakistan at Kabul chanting anti-Pakistani\r\nslogans. The staff of the Embassy, contrary to all\r\nrecognized principles of international law, used a firearm\r\nfrom inside the Embassy premises against the peaceful\r\ndemonstrators. This caused the death of one of the\r\nstudents, a student by the name of Badruddin Muslim, an\r\neleventh grader in the Naderia High School of Kabul.\r\nThis highly unjustifiable and provocative act of the\r\nEmbassy staff incited the fury of the demonstrators, who\r\nin the beginning were non-violent and peaceful, gathered\r\nonly to express their deep resentment at the occupation of\r\npart of their country.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the security forces of the\r\nGovernment were already active in the early morning,\r\nhaving observed the spontaneous gathering of people in\r\ndifferent parts of Kabul city. The security forces formed\r\ntwo security belts around the Embassy premises.\r\nHowever, the death of the young demonstrator caused a\r\nsudden reaction and, unfortunately, the crowd got out of\r\ncontrol. The security forces tried their utmost to prevent\r\nthe upsurge of violence and to protect the Embassy and\r\nits staff. Regrettably, despite the losses suffered by the\r\nsecurity forces, five of whose personnel were killed while\r\nprotecting the Embassy, they did not succeed in\r\npreventing this tragic event. Mr. Ejaz Ali, the Third\r\nSecretary of the Pakistani Embassy at Kabul, a witness to\r\nthe event, acknowledged in an interview at Islamabad\r\nairport on 7 September 1995 that the security forces of\r\nthe Afghan Government exerted efforts to avert the tragic\r\nhappening.\r\nWe declare from this rostrum that the Afghan nation\r\nnever had recourse to terrorism, even during the long\r\nyears of resistance against the invasion of their country by\r\nthe former Soviet Union. That fact clearly shows that,\r\ndespite heavy sacrifices by the Afghan nation, it never\r\nhad recourse to terrorist acts against any consulate or\r\nembassy of the former Soviet Union.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nSecondly, in his statement the Foreign Minister of\r\nPakistan referred nine times to the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan as the “Kabul regime” or the “Rabbani\r\nregime”. We do not intend to reciprocate with similar unfair\r\nlanguage because of our sincerity and commitment to\r\nfriendship towards Pakistan.\r\nThirdly, it is ironic to witness His Excellency the\r\nForeign Minister of Pakistan prescribing the type, nature\r\nand characteristics of a government that he would like to\r\nsee in Afghanistan. My delegation, however, reciprocates\r\nthe sense of good will and brotherhood he expressed\r\nregarding our two nations. Moreover, we recall with\r\nappreciation the strong sense of brotherhood and Islamic\r\nsolidarity by which the fraternal nation of Pakistan extended\r\nits support to the just struggle, the Jihad of the Afghan\r\nnation, against the invading forces of the former Soviet\r\nUnion. We trust that our Pakistani brothers are also fully\r\naware of the sacrifices we made when Afghanistan served\r\nas a shield for the protection of Pakistan territories against\r\nthe most important mobilization of an army since the war\r\nin Viet Nam.\r\nHowever, our complaint is addressed, not to the nation\r\nof Pakistan, but against the manifest interferences of\r\nPakistani authorities, especially the Inter-Service\r\nIntelligence (ISI), which is the Pakistani military\r\nintelligence. Sometimes the explanations of the Pakistani\r\nGovernment, which claims to remain impartial, seem to be\r\njustified owing to the fact that the Pakistani civilian\r\nadministration is not capable of containing the operations of\r\nthe ISI, a powerful military-intelligence body which has\r\nemerged as a State within the State.\r\nSecondly, we wonder which of the internationally\r\naccepted norms and principles governing relations between\r\nnations justify the Pakistani desire to prescribe the type and\r\ncharacteristics of government for a sovereign and\r\nindependent neighbour. Could there be any clearer example\r\nof Pakistani interference in our internal affairs?\r\nThe Foreign Minister of Pakistan has repeatedly\r\nclaimed that Pakistan is not interfering in the internal\r\naffairs of Afghanistan. Let us leave aside all evidence\r\npertaining to the aggression of the Pakistani frontier militia\r\non Afghan territory, as set out in the documents of the\r\nSecurity Council that we have submitted, as well as the\r\ncomments and statements of independent international\r\nreporters and scholarly analysts on Afghanistan identifying\r\nand highlighting the interference of Pakistani military\r\nintelligence in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as the only\r\nsource of the present-day conflict in Afghanistan. We need\r\nonly refer to internationally recognized newspapers: The\r\nWashington Times, in its issue of 24 September 1995, The\r\nTimes of London, 26 September 1995, and The Canberra\r\nTimes, 11 September 1995.\r\nBoth The Washington Times and The Times of\r\nLondon quote Ambassador Mestiri’s comments regarding\r\nthe so-called Taliban and Pakistan’s involvement in\r\nsupporting them.\r\nThe Times of London of Tuesday, 26 September\r\n1995, under the headline “Student army gives notice of\r\nattack on Kabul”, states,\r\n“Mahmoud Mestiri, who heads the United Nations\r\npeace efforts in Afghanistan, said he was convinced\r\nPakistan was behind the Taliban group”.\r\nThe Washington Times of 24 September 1995, in an\r\narticle entitled “Pakistan aid to rebels has Kabul talking\r\nwar”, states,\r\n“Even the United Nations special envoy to\r\nAfghanistan is suspicious ... The power of Taliban\r\nis mysterious\u0027, envoy Mahmoud Mestiri said. I\r\nthink they are getting money and help, maybe from\r\nPakistan\u0027.”\r\nThe same article, written by Ian Stewart of the Associated\r\nPress, contains a description of a Taliban fighter:\r\n“One of a new breed of noble fighter in\r\nAfghanistan, the dust-caked 19-year-old is armed\r\nwith a Kalashnikov and the writings of the Muslim\r\nProphet Mohammed and trained, he says, in\r\nPakistan”.\r\nIn his statement, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan\r\ncannot conceal the true intention of his Government with\r\nrespect to Afghanistan. He inadvertently uncovers the\r\nintention:\r\n“provocation will not deter us from our steadfast\r\npath of neutrality towards the Afghan people and the\r\nunity of Afghanistan or from non-interference in\r\nAfghanistan’s internal affairs, nor will it affect our\r\nabiding friendship and brotherhood with the Afghan\r\nnation”. (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 8th meeting,\r\np. 22)\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nHowever, subsequently the Foreign Minister of Pakistan\r\nnegates the spirit of the above by saying,\r\n“In the meantime, we would like to assure the people\r\nof Afghanistan that we shall stand by them in their\r\nhour of trial. We shall not abandon them.” (ibid.)\r\nI am certain that the words “we shall stand by them in their\r\nhour of trial” will raise a question in the minds of the\r\nMembers of the Assembly: what could Pakistan’s intention\r\nbe in making such a statement?\r\nThe former Soviet Union’s aggression in Afghanistan\r\nis long over. Our nation would like our neighbours and the\r\nworld to assist us in our endeavours towards national\r\nreconciliation and peace.\r\nMoreover, His Excellency the Foreign Minister of\r\nPakistan promises that they will not abandon the Afghans.\r\nThe Assembly should realize that this amounts to assuring\r\nthe opposition of the Afghan Government that Pakistan will\r\ncontinue interfering in Afghanistan’s affairs in their favour\r\nuntil the Islamic State is destabilized and a proxy\r\nGovernment obedient to the will of Pakistan’s Government\r\nis brought to power.\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan has cast\r\ninto doubt the legitimacy and legality of the Afghan\r\nGovernment and the territory governed by it. We call on\r\nHis Excellency the Foreign Minister of Pakistan to allow\r\nany impartial observer to visit the north-western agencies\r\nand find out if the central Government of Pakistan has any\r\nadministrative authority over them. Is it not a fact that the\r\nproduction of firearms has continued, as an ongoing\r\ntraditional trade, ever since the establishment of Pakistan?\r\nWhere is heroin, the most dangerous enemy of humanity,\r\nproduced and refined? John F. Burns of The New York\r\nTimes wrote,\r\n“Top army officers have been accused in the past of\r\nconniving with drug lords, to the extent of running\r\nheroin shipments to Karachi aboard army-owned\r\ntrucks”. (“Heroin scourges million Pakistanis”, The\r\nNew York Times, 5 April 1995, Section A, p. 12)\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan and Pakistan will\r\nboth be losers if they try to confront each other. The only\r\nway leading towards securing both countries’ highest\r\ninterests is to re-establish, broaden and consolidate their\r\nmutual brotherly relations on the basis of equality of States,\r\nrespect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty\r\nand the right of each to determine its own future.\r\nPresident Rabbani is a strong believer in the\r\nperpetual necessity for both countries to establish ties of\r\nfraternity and cooperation. Both countries, and the entire\r\nregion of Asia where they live side by side, will gain\r\nthrough Afghan-Pakistani friendship.\r\nWhile the international community is deploying\r\nefforts to prevent conflicts and wars, the peace and\r\nsecurity of individuals and of human communities are\r\nunder the threat of an undeclared and inhumane war\r\nwaged by the world’s terrorists. This year the world has\r\nwitnessed terrible terrorist acts, such as the tragedies in\r\nOklahoma City, Paris and Tokyo, in which many innocent\r\ncivilians lost their lives.\r\nProsperity and the welfare of the human being\r\ncannot be secured without tranquillity and peace of mind.\r\nIf the international community does not take drastic\r\nmeasures to eradicate terrorism, people in different\r\nregions of the world will continue to live in fear and\r\nunder the menace of terrorist acts. Islam teaches the\r\nprinciple of the rights of innocents to live in safety and\r\ndignity. The Islamic State of Afghanistan considers that\r\nthere is a great need for the signing of an international\r\ntreaty ensuring meaningful cooperation between States, in\r\nthe form of a convention to combat terrorism.\r\nAfghanistan, as one of the early Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, contributed to the drafting, discussion and\r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nand participated in the drafting of both Covenants of\r\nHuman Rights. We once again reaffirm our deep\r\ncommitment to these international instruments.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan considers respect\r\nfor human rights one of its fundamental objectives.\r\nDuring the year under consideration, however, the human\r\nrights of a number of Afghan citizens in the country, as\r\nwell as international humanitarian law, have,\r\nunfortunately, been violated as a result of the continued\r\nterror perpetrated by the so-called Taliban. The Taliban\r\nmercenaries’ closing of schools for girls and depriving\r\nwomen of their right to work has been a major violation\r\nof human rights. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has the\r\nconviction that taking appropriate and effective\r\ninternational measures towards putting an end to foreign\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan would\r\nserve as a major step towards the realization of human\r\nrights in the country.\r\nAs far as the issue of women’s rights in Afghanistan\r\nis concerned, as brought to the attention of Mr. Paik, the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nnew United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights\r\nin Afghanistan, during his recent trip to Kabul, such\r\nconcerns do not seem to be appropriate in the case of a\r\ncountry where 383 women army officers, ranking from the\r\nposition of Lieutenant-General to lower positions, defend\r\ntheir people and country; where women are serving as\r\npilots in the Army, as well as parachutists; and where\r\nwomen are representing their country at Afghanistan\r\ndiplomatic missions and are serving in various branches of\r\nthe Administration. Women’s rights are guaranteed in the\r\npresently enforced laws and regulations governing the life\r\nof our nation.\r\nI turn now to the question of land-mines. For the first\r\ntime, an international meeting was held in Geneva on mine\r\nclearance. This meeting further enhanced international\r\nawareness of different dimensions of the land-mine crisis\r\nand contributed to strengthening international cooperation.\r\nIt is an alarming fact that every year, while 100,000 land-\r\nmines are removed, more than 2 million land-mines are\r\nlaid. An estimated 30 people are killed by land-mines, and\r\nas many as 60 are maimed, every single day. The slow\r\npace of demining operations is another major concern to be\r\nnoted. According to the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC), at the current pace of the mine-removal\r\nprocess, it will take 1,100 years to get rid of existing mines\r\n- and the laying of mines continues in different regions of\r\nthe world.\r\nAs we already stated in the Geneva meeting on mine\r\nclearance, only the adoption of a convention which would\r\nban the production, sale and stockpiling of all varieties of\r\nland-mines, and especially a sincere commitment on the\r\npart of mine-producing countries to such an instrument,\r\nwould serve effectively to put an end to this problem.\r\nAfghanistan, a war-stricken country, where the largest\r\nnumber of land-mines have been laid, needs further\r\nassistance from the international community. This assistance\r\nwould further help the cause of the repatriation of refugees\r\nand the revitalization of agricultural activities all over the\r\ncountry.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan expresses its serious\r\nconcern at the acts of aggression and genocide that continue\r\nto be committed against the people of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Effective measures should be\r\ntaken to put an end, once and for all, to this tragic crisis.\r\nSrebrenica and Zepa must be restored as safe areas and the\r\nsiege of Sarajevo must be ended. The International Tribunal\r\non war crimes in the former Yugoslavia should bring to\r\njustice those Serbian civil and military individuals who\r\nperpetrated crimes of war and genocide, and crimes against\r\nhumanity. Afghanistan has repeatedly maintained the view\r\nthat the arms embargo against the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is not applicable de jure. The right of the\r\nvictim to self-defence has to be respected and restored.\r\nI would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to one\r\nof the great threats to the life, health and well-being of\r\npresent and future generations. This man-made plague is\r\nnarcotic drugs, and its production, sale and smuggling.\r\nThe expansion of the poppy fields in my country,\r\nAfghanistan, as one of the legacies of war, is unfortunate.\r\nStatistics show that the cultivation of poppy increased\r\nduring 1994, as compared to 1993. This is in spite of the\r\nallocation of about $25 million, which the international\r\ncommunity spent in Afghanistan through non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. The Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan cannot agree to the procedure through which\r\nthe assistance was channeled. Perhaps an evaluation is\r\nneeded to correct the procedure. The Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan declares its sincere readiness to cooperate\r\neffectively with regional and international organizations.\r\nWe are working for the preparation of a master plan to\r\neffectively combat narcotic drugs on the regional and\r\ninternational levels. We have invited Mr. Giacomelli, the\r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme, to visit Afghanistan and speed\r\nup the drawing up of such a master plan.\r\nWe have had critical episodes in our life, but we\r\nhave a vision of a peaceful and stable Afghanistan; an\r\nAfghanistan which it is hoped this Assembly will render\r\nfree of foreign interference in its internal affairs; an\r\nAfghanistan where our people come to be blessed with\r\nbrotherhood and understanding, national conciliation and\r\nunity; a country to which its 3 million refugees will have\r\nreturned with confidence and assurance, and where our\r\nintellectuals, as a source of hope, will dedicate their vast\r\nenergy and experience and their scientific and physical\r\npotential to the cause of rebuilding their country; a\r\ncountry that will once again serve as a major factor in the\r\nstrengthening of regional peace and stability; a country\r\nthat will be actively involved in the common efforts of\r\nthis world family in combating extremism, adhering to a\r\npositive and dynamic impartial and non-aligned policy,\r\nand firmly participating in combating terrorism and drug\r\nabuse. Such a vision takes its source from the heart of our\r\nnation.\r\nOur expectation of the world community is that it\r\nassist us in achieving these goals. The objectives of the\r\nreconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan\r\ncannot be achieved without economic assistance from\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nindustrialized nations and other countries that are able to\r\nfurnish such assistance. Afghanistan has enormous\r\neconomic capabilities. During the time the former Soviet\r\nUnion thought of our country as its strategic backyard, the\r\nworld’s major corporations were prevented from becoming\r\ninvolved in the exploration of Afghanistan’s natural\r\nresources and wealth. At the threshold of Afghanistan’s\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation, possibilities exist for the\r\nexploration of our natural wealth, such as natural gas, oil,\r\ncopper, iron, precious stones and even uranium.\r\nAfghanistan can become a major producer and exporter of\r\nfruit. Once the crisis is over, Afghanistan will emerge as\r\none of the most attractive sites for private investment.\r\nAfghanistan, a land-locked country, is now vitally important\r\nat the heart of Asia, connecting Central Asia to the south\r\nand the Middle East as a historical transit route.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we invite the industrialized\r\ncountries, as well as private sectors, to benefit from the\r\nenormous investment opportunities in our country. In this\r\ncontext, the Islamic State of Afghanistan warmly welcomes\r\ndelegations determined to conduct relevant studies, as it is\r\nexpecting a number of potential investors in the coming\r\nmonth. This move would itself contribute towards the\r\nfurther strengthening of stability and an early return of\r\npeace to Afghanistan.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the next speaker, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of The former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, His Excellency Mr. Stevo\r\nCrvenkovski.\r\nMr. Crvenkovski (The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): I extend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral my warm\r\ncongratulations on his election as President of this jubilee\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. At the same time\r\nI wish to express appreciation to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Amara Essy, for his very successful work.\r\nOn 3 October 1995, in a cowardly terrorist act, an\r\nattempt was made on the life of the President of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Kiro Gligorov. This assassination\r\nattempt was a deliberate political act intended to destabilize\r\nmy country. It was carried out, not insignificantly, at a time\r\nwhen the centuries-old dream of the Macedonian people for\r\ntheir own State and for an equal role in the international\r\ncommunity had come true. Furthermore, it happened at the\r\nvery time when the resolution of the situation in the\r\nBalkans was in sight and when all of our neighbours and\r\nthe world had come to accept the fact that the Republic of\r\nMacedonia was a reality, and a factor of peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThe attempt to assassinate President Gligorov is an\r\nattack against the independent and peace-loving position\r\nof Macedonia. It is directed against life in peace and\r\nagainst the well-being of all our citizens. This terrorist act\r\nhas been strongly condemned and decisively rejected by\r\nall of my countrymen, as well as by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations against\r\nterrorism — a criminal phenomenon — must continue\r\nwith a strong determination to wipe this scourge out\r\ncompletely. We should all fight unabatedly against the\r\nforces of darkness and the power-hungry demagogues\r\nwho are the main source and generator of criminal\r\nterrorist activities.\r\nThe attempt to assassinate my President on\r\n3 October 1995 shall not, under any circumstances, divert\r\nus in our pursuit of democracy, reforms, and the\r\ndevelopment of good-neighbourly relations with all of our\r\nneighbours, in brief, our efforts to transform our country\r\ninto a modern European State.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General\r\nand all delegations in this body our sincere gratitude for\r\ntheir sympathy and solidarity and for their wishes for the\r\nspeedy recovery of my President.\r\nAs our Organization approaches the next 50 years,\r\nas we approach the twenty-first century, it is timely to\r\nacknowledge and pay tribute to the great achievements of\r\nthe United Nations in bringing about a better and safer\r\nworld and to stress the need to work together to improve\r\nour Organization and prepare for the challenges of the\r\nfuture.\r\nThroughout the past 50 years, the United Nations has\r\nbeen the right place in which to build better\r\nunderstanding among nations, the right place in which to\r\naddress some of the basic problems and needs of\r\nhumanity and the right place in which to coordinate\r\nactions towards a brighter future for mankind. The United\r\nNations assisted in achieving peace in many regions of\r\nthe world; it succeeded in preventing many conflicts; it\r\nhelped in decolonization; it delivered humanitarian\r\nassistance; it succeeded in minimizing the nuclear threat\r\nand in building bridges over many gulfs between\r\ncountries all over the world.\r\nIn the past few years, very important decisions have\r\nbeen adopted at many United Nations conferences, such\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nas the Earth Summit in Rio, the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights in Vienna, the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development in Cairo, the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development in Copenhagen, the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing, the 1995 Review and\r\nExtension Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in New York\r\nand the discussions on land-mines at the Conference on\r\nDisarmament in Geneva. We must work to implement the\r\ndecisions made at these conferences. We must work on\r\nfinalizing the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, and on\r\nfurthering the disarmament process. At the same time, we\r\nmust also begin working towards finding solutions to, and\r\npreventing, the new problems and challenges that we are\r\nfacing in this ever-changing world. Rapid technological\r\nprogress brings new hope for a better future but also puts\r\ndangerous power into the hands of some of the worst\r\nenemies of our civilization. We have to design new\r\nmechanisms that will enable us to face these new\r\nchallenges and enable the United Nations to achieve new\r\nsuccesses in the next 50 years.\r\nOn the basis of the experience of the past 50 years, we\r\nwill have to examine the functioning of the United Nations\r\nsystem as a whole, to restructure some of its parts, and to\r\nassign new tasks to some of the others for the purpose of\r\nachieving the efficiency of the Organization as a whole.\r\nThe United Nations must have as its vision a world that is\r\nmore stable, politically and economically. The recent\r\nagreement between Israel and Palestine gives hope for\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East. We strongly support the\r\nSecretary-General’s Agenda for Development and hope that,\r\nat this session, we will carry out this most important\r\nundertaking successfully.\r\nEconomic development is necessary for political and\r\nsocial stability. For many countries access to markets and\r\nthe question of finances for development are of essential\r\nimportance. We must also ensure that the United Nations\r\nshall continue to be financially viable. Each Member of the\r\nUnited Nations, however large or small, has an obligation\r\nto do its share. We must also discuss the possible\r\nimprovement of the work of the Security Council. To this\r\nend, my delegation fully supports the inclusion of Germany\r\nand Japan as permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nAt this session of the General Assembly, I can assure\r\nthe President of the General Assembly that he will have the\r\nfull support of the Macedonian delegation in bringing to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion the many important issues we have\r\non the agenda. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nthank this General Assembly for giving us the important\r\nduty of presiding over the Second Committee. We attach\r\nparticular significance to the economic issues that will be\r\ndiscussed there.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia, despite difficult\r\nconditions, achieved its independence peacefully, without\r\nthe use of force and with respect for all international\r\nnorms. In a region so burdened by tragic wars, a region\r\nwith violations of human rights, with a high degree of\r\ninstability, we have pursued the path of our independence\r\nwith a strong commitment to resolve all of our problems\r\nand conflicts peacefully, through dialogue, with good will,\r\nwith readiness for cooperation with all of our neighbours\r\nand with all international organizations.\r\nWe are determined to contribute, within the\r\nframework of our capabilities, to the overcoming of all of\r\nthe divisions and conflicts in the Balkans inherited from\r\nthe past and to pursue the integration of our country into\r\nEurope as soon as possible, with respect for all of the\r\nEuropean norms and standards of relations between\r\ncountries as the only means to avoid repeating the tragic\r\nincidents of this region.\r\nOne of the basic principles of our foreign policy is\r\nthat of equidistance in our relations with our neighbours,\r\na readiness to establish equally good relations with all of\r\nour neighbours, based on mutual respect, the inviolability\r\nof borders, non-interference in the internal affairs of other\r\ncountries, and non-use of force.\r\nRecently in this building, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, through the mediation of Cyrus Vance,\r\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General, Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and Matthew Nimetz, Special Envoy of\r\nPresident Clinton, my country, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, reached an accord with the Republic of\r\nGreece which regulates many aspects of relations between\r\nthe two countries, and creates a basis for good-\r\nneighbourly cooperation. We believe that this accord will\r\ncontribute to increased stability in the Balkans and will\r\nhave a positive influence on the future development of\r\nevents in the region. We believe this accord is a good\r\nillustration of the positive role of the international\r\ncommunity, and especially of the United Nations, in\r\npursuing peaceful solutions in relations between States,\r\nbased on the principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia, during its four years of\r\nindependence, has faced many challenges. The economy\r\nof the whole region was deeply disturbed by the war to\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nthe north of us. As a result of the United Nations sanctions\r\nagainst Serbia and Montenegro, the usual route to our\r\ntraditional markets in Europe was cut off. The losses caused\r\nto our economy by the sanctions amount to over $4 billion.\r\nSince February 1994, we have also been under a unilateral\r\ntrade embargo from the south. In the same period, we have\r\nundertaken a thorough transformation of our economy,\r\nturning it into a market-oriented economy, with all of the\r\ndifficulties and risks that this transition brings. Despite all\r\nof this, we have succeeded in maintaining a high level of\r\npolitical, social and economic stability. We have built new\r\ndemocratic institutions with provisions for full protection of\r\nhuman rights and a political system in which all national\r\nminorities are recognized and enjoy full participation. We\r\ncannot claim that we have solved all of our problems.\r\nHowever, we have built the right mechanisms for solving\r\nthem.\r\nA great deal of attention has been given during this\r\nsession of the General Assembly to United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping operations. The enormous efforts of the United\r\nNations in many peace-keeping operations have had varied\r\nresults. Some of them have been more successful than\r\nothers. Allow me to say a few words about the United\r\nNations peace-keeping operation in the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, the United Nations Preventive Deployment\r\nForce (UNPREDEP). It is a very successful operation and\r\nis fully achieving its goals. It has contributed tremendously\r\nto peace and stability in the southern Balkans and has built\r\nconfidence among the people of the Republic of Macedonia\r\nin international organizations. This operation proves that\r\npreventive deployment is the most effective channel for\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts. This operation is the\r\nbest example that results can be achieved even with a\r\nsmall, almost symbolic deployment of United Nations\r\npeace-keepers, if it is done at the right time and with a\r\nclear mandate. The full support the people of the Republic\r\nof Macedonia are giving this operation shows that the right\r\ndecision was made by the Security Council when this\r\npeace-keeping operation was approved. This has been a\r\nvery successful operation, and we hope it will serve as a\r\nmodel for many future activities of the United Nations; if\r\nso, I am confident that the same positive results will be\r\nachieved.\r\nThese days there is new hope that peace in Bosnia can\r\nbe achieved. This tragic war has resulted in huge numbers\r\nof victims, a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe and\r\nmassive destruction. We hope that the efforts of the\r\ninternational community will result in a solution which will\r\nrespect the basic principles of the modern world. Bosnia\r\nshould be preserved as an independent State within its\r\ninternationally recognized borders. Provision must be\r\nmade for full respect of human rights, and repetition of\r\natrocities and war crimes must never be allowed.\r\nWe believe that as soon as peace is achieved it will\r\nbe necessary to start the process of the reduction of arms\r\nin the Balkans, to start the process of a Balkan détente.\r\nThis year the General Assembly, under item 81 of\r\nits agenda, will consider the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the development of good-neighbourly relations\r\namong Balkan States, prepared on the basis of resolution\r\n48/84 B, adopted at its forty-eighth session on the\r\nproposal of the Macedonian delegation. It is expected that\r\nspecial attention will be paid to measures and preventive\r\nactivities aimed at the creation of a stable zone of peace\r\nand cooperation in the Balkans by the year 2000.\r\nThe only way to achieve long-term peace and\r\nstability in the whole Balkan region is through the full\r\nintegration of all the Balkan countries into Europe, with\r\nfull respect for European standards and norms. The\r\nindependence, territorial integrity and inviolability of the\r\nborders of all Balkan countries must be respected.\r\nProblems of national minorities that have been at the root\r\nof many conflicts in the Balkans throughout its history\r\nshould be addressed. All national minorities should be\r\nrecognized and their basic human rights fully respected.\r\nIt is our duty to work for peace and the democratic\r\ndevelopment of the whole Balkan region now, and not to\r\nleave burdens of the past to future generations.\r\nJust as we must work for the stabilization of the\r\nBalkan region as a whole, we must also recognize the\r\nuniqueness of each of the countries of the region. The\r\nproblems are not identical, and therefore the solutions\r\ncannot be identical. There are a lot of discussions about\r\nthe problems of former Yugoslavia. It is very important\r\nto understand that there is no such entity as former\r\nYugoslavia”. There are a number of new countries in this\r\narea, each with their own set of problems and prospects,\r\nand there is no way to find a unified solution for these\r\nproblems. Each country must be treated individually.\r\nThe hope and desire for a better world were the\r\nfoundations for the United Nations 50 years ago. At this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, it is our duty to lay the\r\ngroundwork for the role of the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century. We should all work together towards\r\na safer world and to reduce the fears and threats of the\r\nfuture as much as possible.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Kyrgyzstan, Mrs. Rosa Otunbayeva.\r\nMrs. Otunbayeva (Kyrgyzstan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): On behalf of the delegation of my country, I\r\nwould like to congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on\r\nhis election to the lofty post of President of the fiftieth,\r\nanniversary session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. We would also like to express our deep gratitude\r\nto the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, who is at the head of our Organization at\r\nthis momentous time, for his tireless efforts to strengthen\r\npeace and security around the world.\r\nThe fireworks commemorating victory in the Second\r\nWorld War still resounded when our Organization was\r\ncoming into being, but the world had already been divided\r\nby military and ideological confrontation. In the Soviet\r\nUnion, Ministries of Foreign Affairs were founded in each\r\nof the republics and hastily staffed with diplomatic\r\npersonnel. However, the Soviet Union’s attempts to use its\r\nrepublics to increase the number of votes in its bloc within\r\nthe newly formed international Organization were not\r\nsuccessful. Only three out of the 15 republics were accepted\r\nas Members of the United Nations. Frozen by the years of\r\nthe cold war, we gained our independence without any\r\nviolence or bloodshed. Now, almost half a century later, we\r\nhave entered into the community of fully-fledged Members\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nSince then, the world has gone through dramatic\r\nchanges. Today we need the United Nations as never\r\nbefore.\r\nThrough the United Nations, we, the post-socialist\r\ncountries, enter into the world and interact with countries\r\nof the North and the South, the West and the East. Within\r\nonly four years of attaining independence, Kyrgyzstan has\r\nbecome a Member of the United Nations and has joined the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the\r\nNorth Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO), as well as\r\nmany other international political and financial\r\norganizations. The United Nations represents the main axis\r\nof the foreign policy of our young country, and we will\r\nwork without respite to increase the effectiveness of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs small countries, we see in the United Nations a\r\nguarantor of our independence, security and justice, based\r\non mutual respect for international law. The law is our\r\nstrongest argument in the family of the United Nations.\r\nAs countries with economies in transition and as\r\ndeveloping democracies, we receive extremely important\r\nand urgent aid and support from the United Nations:\r\nmedicine, food and technical equipment. The Gramin\r\nBank is fighting rising poverty by giving the people\r\nmicroloans. We are trying to build a civil society by\r\neducating the non-governmental organizations, lawyers\r\nand journalists. On 24 December 1995, open presidential\r\nelections will take place in Kyrgyzstan, to which we\r\nwould like to invite observers from all over the world.\r\nOne of our most significant achievements during our\r\nfirst years of independence, as our President, Askar\r\nAkayev, has pointed out, is — in addition to our small\r\neconomic advances on the road to a free market — the\r\nattainment of an inter-ethnic consensus, internal stability\r\nand peace in our country.\r\nHidden tensions based on religious and ethnic\r\ngrounds erupted in Central Asia after the dissolution of\r\nthe Soviet Union, requiring the involvement of the United\r\nNations, the OSCE and the CIS. We commend the\r\nmediating role of the United Nations, which led to a\r\ncease-fire agreement and the beginning of a dialogue\r\nbetween the sides in the inter-Tajik conflict. The five\r\ncountries of Central Asia, along with the Russian\r\nFederation, are doing their best to launch the fifth round\r\nof talks on the conflict in Tajikistan. These should lead to\r\na dialogue regarding fundamental issues pertaining to the\r\npolitical future of the country.\r\nActions taken by the organs of the United Nations\r\nsystem, the donor countries and international financial\r\ninstitutions should range from humanitarian assistance to\r\nlong-term development programmes. This is true for both\r\nTajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. I strongly support the proposal\r\nby the Secretary of State of the United Kingdom,\r\nMr. Malcolm Rifkind, for the establishment within the\r\nUnited Nations of special programmes for stabilization\r\nand transition.\r\nIt is a sign of the times that, in the face of horrible\r\nand prolonged conflicts, all the major countries, for the\r\nfirst time in half a century, have joined together to build\r\nand keep the peace.\r\nStep by step, the knot in the Middle East is being\r\nuntied. We would like to congratulate Israel and Palestine\r\non the recent signing of an agreement on the West Bank,\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nand we hope that both parties will have patience, courage\r\nand success on this difficult road to peace. There are\r\npromising hopes for a settlement to be reached that will end\r\nthe conflict in Bosnia. Kyrgyzstan welcomes the peace talks\r\nbased on the Washington Agreements on the creation of a\r\nState based on the federal principle. We are convinced that\r\nthe time has come to focus the world’s attention on the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan. There can be no peace in Asia\r\nwithout the settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan.\r\nIt is impossible to be a mere spectator when the\r\nflames of wars and conflicts scorch our borders and\r\ndecrease stability. Kazakstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan\r\nhave announced their willingness to create a peace-keeping\r\nunit under the auspices of the United Nations. We are\r\nconvinced of the need to have such United Nations\r\noperational peace-keeping forces in reserve, so they can be\r\ncalled upon in extreme situations.\r\nThere remains an undiscovered potential when it\r\ncomes to cooperation among the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE, the United Nations and the CIS, and all of them\r\ntogether when it comes to solving conflicts in post-Soviet\r\nterritory. It is not by competing but by cooperating that the\r\nregional security institutions can stop the violence and\r\nexplosions. They can use a wide spectrum of preventive\r\nmeasures, such as “planting” the culture of peace, bringing\r\nthe sides to the negotiating table and constant monitoring.\r\nBorder issues, the distribution of water and natural\r\nresources, the rights of ethnic minorities: we in Central\r\nAsia need international legal expertise in all these areas, as\r\nwell as the introduction of proven legal, political, socio-\r\neconomic norms and regulations.\r\nFully sharing the responsibility for peace and security\r\nin our region, the newly independent States of Central Asia\r\nare trying to do all they can to keep peace and order on the\r\nland given to us by God. Kazakstan is working with\r\npersistence to organize a conference on confidence-building\r\nmeasures in Asia. Uzbekistan is working on the idea of a\r\nstanding seminar on the subject of regional security.\r\nTurkmenistan declared its intention to become a neutral\r\nState. During a meeting in May of this year at Lake\r\nIssyk-Kul, representatives of the five countries, with the\r\nsupport of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), created a standing seminar on stable development\r\nfor Central Asia.\r\nKyrgyzstan and other Central Asian countries\r\nsupported with great enthusiasm the unconditional and\r\nindefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty\r\nat the 1995 Conference on that Treaty. Along with\r\nUzbekistan, my country calls for establishing Central Asia\r\nas a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It is our firm wish to\r\nfinalize work on the agreement on a comprehensive test-\r\nban treaty no later than 1996 and to make the moratorium\r\non nuclear testing universal and permanent.\r\nFree economic and trade zones have become\r\nefficient instruments in speeding up trade and\r\ndevelopment among countries and continents. To make\r\nthe world a safer place, we need other types of zones: not\r\njust non-nuclear but “non-conflict” zones. Central Asia\r\ncould become such a testing ground.\r\nThe lessons of the last decade require focused and\r\ncompassionate attention from the United Nations and the\r\nworld community in general on countries in transition\r\nsuch as Kyrgyzstan. The United Nations and its\r\norganizations — UNDP, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) — although sometimes\r\noverwhelmed by the unprecedented nature and scope of\r\nproblems such as those of refugees, natural disasters,\r\ndegradation of the environment, illegal drug trafficking\r\nand the spread of AIDS, deserve a great deal of credit for\r\nhelping us to solve severe social problems in this difficult\r\ntransition period. It is not only professional office\r\nmanagers who work there, but true implementators of\r\nreforms. World forums of the United Nations — from\r\nCairo to Copenhagen, from Beijing to the Habitat II\r\nConference scheduled to be held in Istanbul — bind us\r\ntogether in the United Nations in understanding the\r\nmagnitude of the social problems confronting humanity.\r\nImplementing their decisions will require enthusiasm and\r\na huge concentration of effort. The most important thing\r\nnow is action — the political will of Member States to\r\ngo forward— effective international monitoring and\r\n“glasnost”.\r\nThe participation of women in all these\r\ntransformations is of critical importance. The world in the\r\ntwenty-first century means equal rights for men and\r\nwomen, for my son and my daughter, my daughter and\r\nmillions of other young girls and women in Central Asia,\r\nto be married in accordance with their own choice and\r\ndesires, to have unrestricted access to education and\r\nemployment, to be elected to Parliament and to work at\r\nall levels of government. It is for the sake of these goals\r\nthat I am tirelessly working today.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nWe welcome the intention and determination of the\r\nPresident for this session, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral of Portugal, personally to lead the activities of\r\na High-level Open-ended Working Group to report on the\r\nsubject of reform to the General Assembly at its fiftieth\r\nsession. We, the Member States of the United Nations,\r\nexpect not only thorough and precise reports, but seek\r\nconcrete, genuine reforms and changes.\r\nKyrgyzstan favours an enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil, while bearing in mind the need for appropriate\r\nregional balance. Germany and Japan, in our view, deserve\r\nto be elected to the Council as permanent members. Being\r\namong the biggest contributors to the United Nations\r\nbudget, they are playing an ever-increasing role in\r\nstrengthening peace and promoting development and\r\ndemocracy. It is also necessary to increase the number of\r\nnon-permanent Security Council members.\r\nThe world at the end of the twentieth century is as\r\ncomplicated and multi-faceted as we are — peoples and\r\ncountries on six continents who are burdened with their\r\ndaily problems and worries, their dreams and concerns.\r\nModern means of communication and speed have\r\nencouraged humankind to feel more united on an\r\nunprotected Earth. It is likely that no one would have tried\r\nto rule the world if it were a single voting district.\r\nThe United Nations, empowered by its 185 Member\r\nStates with a clear understanding of its responsibility, is\r\nwisely and competently leading us to the new millennium.\r\nMy country is going forward consciously and confidently\r\nunder the United Nations banner with a hope for a better\r\nfuture.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right\r\nof reply.\r\nMay I remind Members that statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Abolhassani Shahreza (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): Today we all listened to the statement made by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nwho once again laid claims against the territorial integrity\r\nof my country that have no basis in history or in\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe position of my Government is clear and needs\r\nno reiteration in detail. We categorically reject these\r\nclaims. Therefore, I will confine myself to making a few\r\nbrief remarks.\r\nFirst, the Islamic Republic of Iran is fully committed\r\nto its international obligations, especially those arising\r\nfrom the Agreement of 1971. We firmly believe that\r\nmisunderstandings over the interpretation or\r\nimplementation of that Agreement, if any, should be\r\naddressed with good will and through mutually-agreed\r\nmechanisms in order to find an amicable solution.\r\nWe thus oppose any measure that might cause\r\ninstability in the sensitive region of the Persian Gulf and\r\nthus adversely affect the interests of all countries in the\r\nregion. For its part, the Islamic Republic of Iran is\r\ncommitted to respect and maintain peace, security and\r\ntranquillity in the region.\r\nSecondly, the appropriate and practical step to\r\nremove misunderstandings between nations is direct\r\nnegotiations between the parties concerned, a process\r\nwhich allows all those directly concerned to show\r\nflexibility and to manage the whole mechanism of\r\nsettlement by themselves.\r\nOn the basis of this principle, my Government\r\nremains prepared to take up the misunderstandings over\r\nthe island of Abu Moosa directly with officials of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and stands ready to enter into\r\nnegotiations without preconditions. We have shown our\r\ngood will by dispatching two high-level delegations,\r\nincluding our Foreign Minister, to the United Arab\r\nEmirates to resolve these misunderstandings.\r\nUnfortunately, our brothers in the United Arab\r\nEmirates have failed to come to Tehran for a continuation\r\nof high-level talks, despite their prior agreement to do so.\r\nThey have a standing invitation to bilateral talks in\r\nTehran aimed at resolving the issue in a friendly and\r\nneighbourly atmosphere. We have consistently underlined\r\nthe efficiency of this mechanism, and do not really see\r\nany genuine utility in the public exercise of this issue in\r\ninternational forums, including the General Assembly of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThirdly, what we need in the Persian Gulf region is\r\npeace, tranquillity, stability, good-neighbourly relations,\r\nunderstanding and fraternal sincerity and honesty. Our\r\nregion, unfortunately, has witnessed two destructive wars\r\nand many skirmishes, and is still paying the price to\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nmitigate the consequences of those wars and\r\nmiscalculations.\r\nFortunately, we have a history of cordial relations with\r\nthe United Arab Emirates, and we are confident that\r\nwisdom and prudence will ultimately prevail. We are\r\ndetermined to maintain and promote brotherly and good-\r\nneighbourly relations between our two countries.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): It was with great dismay that\r\nmy delegation heard the intervention of the representative\r\nof Afghanistan earlier this afternoon.\r\nPakistan, as is well known, has all along supported the\r\nAfghan cause, expressed its solidarity with the Afghans and\r\nhas made tremendous sacrifices for the people of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nEvents in Afghanistan after the end of foreign\r\noccupation have obviously been a source of deep\r\ndisappointment to us. Pakistan has been following a policy\r\nof strict neutrality and non-interference in Afghanistan’s\r\ninternal affairs. We have no favourites in Afghanistan and,\r\ntherefore, have no preference for one group over another in\r\nthe intra-Afghan rivalries. We believe that the solution to\r\nthe Afghan problem has to emerge from the Afghans\r\nthemselves.\r\nBeing an immediate neighbour, Pakistan does,\r\nhowever, have a vested interest in peace and stability in\r\nAfghanistan; only that would enable the 1.6 million Afghan\r\nrefugees still in Pakistan to return to their homes. That is\r\nwhy we have whole-heartedly supported the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.\r\nPakistan is also ready to assist the brotherly Afghan parties,\r\nin any way possible, to arrive at a peaceful and durable\r\npolitical solution that could bring an end to the ongoing\r\nfratricidal conflict.\r\nThe allegation that Pakistan is interfering in\r\nAfghanistan’s internal affairs is totally baseless and\r\nunwarranted. Pakistan does not support any one group\r\nagainst any other. The Talibans’ take-over of Herat without\r\na single shot being fired and without any bloodshed was\r\nreflective of the Afghan people’s disenchantment with the\r\ncontinuous violence in Afghanistan and with the regime in\r\nKabul. The Afghan representative’s attempt now to blame\r\nPakistan for Kabul’s failure in Herat and elsewhere is only\r\nmeant to cover up the internal political difficulties being\r\nfaced by a Government that no longer has support or\r\nlegitimacy.\r\nReference has been made to the dastardly attack on\r\nand burning down of the Pakistan embassy in Kabul\r\nabout four weeks ago — on 6 September 1995 — by a\r\nmob of 3,000 persons, instigated and led by the Kabul\r\nauthorities. The embassy was burnt down, one staff\r\nmember was killed, and others, including the Ambassador\r\nand the Defence Attaché, received serious wounds. The\r\nattack took place despite the warning we had\r\ncommunicated to the Afghan Government a day before\r\nthe incident.\r\nThere is ample evidence to suggest that the attack\r\nagainst the Pakistani diplomatic mission was aided,\r\nabetted and, in fact, executed by the Kabul authorities\r\nthemselves. This was a gross violation of the norms of\r\ndiplomatic behaviour, and it runs contrary to the Geneva\r\nConvention of 1961. It deserves outright condemnation by\r\nall. All Afghan leaders other than the regime in Kabul\r\nhave condemned it — and rightly so. That is why the\r\nstatement of Afghanistan’s Acting Defence Minister,\r\nMr. Yunnus Qanuni, that the Kabul authorities had\r\nnothing to apologize for in respect of this incident is\r\nextremely deplorable and runs totally contrary to the\r\ntraditional and fraternal ties between the peoples of\r\nAfghanistan and Pakistan.\r\nThe Afghan representative’s statement today and the\r\nwild allegations it contains represent the irrational actions\r\nof a regime that is desperately trying to cling to power\r\ndespite being disowned by its own population. Today it\r\ncontrols no more than 5 out of 32 provinces, and even the\r\ncapital is being progressively surrounded by Afghans who\r\nno longer accept this Government. It is obvious, therefore,\r\nthat the authorities in Kabul no longer enjoy the\r\nconfidence of the people of Afghanistan and no longer\r\nhave the legitimacy that can come only from the support\r\nof the population.\r\nLet me remind the Assembly that, according to the\r\nIslamabad Accord entered into by the political parties in\r\nAfghanistan, the tenure of Professor Rabbani was to come\r\nto an end in June 1994. That commitment was not met,\r\nand the regime in Kabul had its rule extended by\r\nquestionable means for another six months, up to\r\nDecember 1994. Even then the handing over of power did\r\nnot take place. Professor Rabbani then informed the\r\nSecretary-General’s Special Representative, Ambassador\r\nMestiri, that he would hand over power on 21 March\r\n1995. That did not happen — yet again, for the third time\r\nround.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nAmbassador Mestiri, in his address to the donors’\r\nbriefing conference in Stockholm on 2 June 1995, said:\r\n“General Masoud, Professor Rabbani and others\r\nassociated with them have been arguing that by\r\npushing the Taliban out of Kabul they had achieved\r\nvictory all over Afghanistan.”\r\nThe reality is that the base of the Government has become\r\nnarrower and could be said to represent only the Tajik\r\nethnic group. The Pushtuns, Uzbeks and Hazaras have been\r\nalienated. These three ethnic groups, combined, represent\r\nabout 60 per cent of the population of Afghanistan.\r\nThe frank and candid assessment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s representative clearly enunciates the facts\r\nregarding the legitimacy of the Kabul regime. The attempt\r\nnow to implicate Pakistan is clearly designed to divert the\r\nattention of the people of Afghanistan from the core\r\nissue — the transfer of power. It is interesting to note that\r\nonly the Kabul regime is making these strange accusations.\r\nNone of all the other groups and parties in Afghanistan has\r\nmade any such allegations. One can wonder why.\r\nThe truth is that the regime in Kabul no longer has\r\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan population. We can\r\nonly suggest that the quicker the regime in Kabul\r\nacknowledges the loss of popular support and hands over\r\npower, the quicker peace will return to that war-torn\r\ncountry.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): I should like to comment on the statement\r\nmade by the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nregarding the Iranian occupation of three Arab islands —\r\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Moussa — which were\r\npart of the United Arab Emirates but were occupied by the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran in 1971. My delegation regrets\r\nIran’s repeated refusal of all the Emirates’ peace initiatives\r\nwhich called upon the parties to resort to bilateral\r\nnegotiations or to have recourse to the International Court\r\nof Justice in order to settle the dispute.\r\nSince the very beginning of Iran’s occupation of the\r\nthree islands, the United Arab Emirates has continued to\r\nvoice its rejection of that occupation and to call for putting\r\nan end to it in the interests of good-neighbourliness and\r\nconfidence-building between the two countries, in\r\nconsonance with the decisions and resolutions of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the rules of international\r\nlaw. Despite this peaceful approach, the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran persists in adopting measures that aim at\r\nentrenching its military and civilian occupation of the\r\nthree islands.\r\nMore disappointing still is Iran’s persistence in\r\ntrying to divert all efforts towards side issues that have\r\nnothing whatsoever to do with the issue of putting an end\r\nto its occupation. The aim, of course, is to impose a fait\r\naccompli policy that flies in the face of the international\r\ncommunity, which does not accept the occupation of the\r\nterritory of others by force.\r\nBy the same token we should like to reaffirm that,\r\nunder the established rules of international law, Iran’s\r\noccupation of the three islands does not in any way\r\nchange their legal status and, no matter how long it may\r\nlast, it will not give the occupying Power any jurisdiction\r\nor confer upon it any sovereignty. The facts on the\r\nground and the constants of history which are amply\r\ndocumented under our hand rebut the illegal claims of the\r\nIranian Government.\r\nSince 1929, Iran has tried, time and again, to\r\npurchase or to lease those islands from the Government\r\nof the United Arab Emirates. This, by itself, refutes Iran’s\r\nclaims. We, therefore, must ask ourselves how could the\r\nthree islands be Iranian when the Government of Iran,\r\nfollowing the failure by Iran to purchase or lease them,\r\nresorted to occupation and the killing and expulsion of\r\ntheir indigenous population in 1971.\r\nThe polices of hegemony and the use of or threat of\r\nforce pursued by certain States to secure certain regional\r\ngains at the expense of neighbouring countries no longer\r\nhas a place in the context of the international order that\r\nupholds the principles of mutual respect between States\r\nand of non-interference and non-intervention in the\r\ninternal affairs of other States, irrespective of the size of\r\nany State’s territory or density of population.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that the Government of Iran\r\nwill review its unacceptable policies which have been in\r\nplace for over 23 years now, and respond to the peace\r\ninitiatives put forward by my country, with the aim of\r\nengaging in unconditional bilateral negotiations or of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 4 October 1995\r\nhaving recourse to the International Court of Justice in\r\norder to reach a just settlement to the dispute, to return the\r\nislands to their rightful owners and, thereby, to re-establish\r\npeace and justice in the region.\r\nMr. Osmani (Afghanistan): In relation to the\r\ncomments made by Pakistan, my delegation wishes to\r\nreserve its right to make a statement in right of reply at a\r\nsubsequent meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.\r\n22\r\n"
