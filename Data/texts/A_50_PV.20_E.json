(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m.\r\nAddress by His Holiness Pope John Paul II\r\nThe President: This morning the Assembly will hear\r\nan address by His Holiness Pope John Paul II of the\r\nObserver State of the Holy See, on the occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall by the President and the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe President: Your Holiness, this is the second time\r\nthat the General Assembly of the United Nations has been\r\nhonoured with your presence. I feel specially privileged in\r\nbeing able to welcome Your Holiness here today, where\r\nyour presence so clearly confers a mark of distinction on\r\nour Organization on its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nYour Holiness, more than any of your predecessors,\r\nhas travelled to all the corners of the world in your wish to\r\nbring to each of them, even the most distant ones, your\r\nmessage of peace and understanding, tolerance and justice\r\namong men. Your visit here today, more than an act of\r\ncelebration of the United Nations jubilee, is, above all, a\r\nstrong sign of encouragement for this Organization’s\r\nactivities.\r\nThroughout the 50 years of its existence, the United\r\nNations has come to believe that for the ideals of peace and\r\nfraternity to take root deeply among men they must be\r\nbased on economic, social and cultural development as\r\nwell as on the primacy of justice. In all these fields, the\r\nUnited Nations has performed with persistence and\r\ndedication, and with the best of human abilities. Success\r\nand accomplishments have not always been achieved.\r\nHowever, this is not surprising if we take into account the\r\ndifficulties, which are many, and the means, which, in\r\nmost cases, are few.\r\nNevertheless, the ideals endure always, and give us\r\nthe strength to continue. On this fiftieth anniversary,\r\nwhich is an occasion to celebrate, but also a time to\r\nreflect, we are facing many criticisms on both the form\r\nand the performance of our Organization. We should take\r\nthese criticisms into account, but we must not allow them\r\nto paralyse our activities for the benefit of mankind.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWhile the errors and failures have been many during\r\nthe 50 years of the life of the United Nations —\r\ninevitably true for any institution — the benefits, the\r\nsuccesses and the victories gained during that time have\r\nbeen many as well. For each success in the areas of\r\nhealth, justice with respect to labour, the protection of\r\nchildren, support for refugees, the dissemination of culture\r\nand the guaranteeing of peace, it is not only the United\r\nNations that has met its commitments and justified its\r\nexistence. It is mankind itself that has become richer,\r\nennobled, glorified, because someone, on its behalf, has\r\ndone disinterested good, expecting nothing in return.\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nAs Your Holiness can see, in this Hall are seated\r\nrepresentatives of nearly all the countries of the world,\r\nbelonging to very diverse ethnic and religious groups. Yet\r\nall are united in their respect for Your Holiness and in the\r\nattention they will give your words. I think that this is\r\nbecause of the example Your Holiness has set during your\r\npontificate: of total readiness to go forth to meet all who\r\ntruly seek to realize the full potential of mankind and the\r\nwealth of human existence, spiritual and material.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express a wish: that the\r\nwords Your Holiness used before this Assembly 16 years\r\nago still ring true today and that they will do so for the\r\nnext 50 years:\r\n“I hope that the United Nations will ever remain the\r\nsupreme forum of peace and justice, the authentic seat\r\nof the freedom of peoples and individuals in their\r\nlonging for a better future.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Thirty-fourth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 17th meeting, para. 49)\r\nI now call on the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Spirituality is the greatest\r\ngift to humanity. All peoples have been touched by faith.\r\nBelief in a higher reality provides a common bond among\r\nnations. But the horrors we witness today deny the values\r\nof the spirit. Terrible examples on every continent tell us\r\nthat to deny our spiritual nature is to diminish our\r\nhumanity; it is to forget our God.\r\nA crisis of the human spirit is taking place. It accounts\r\nfor many of the major problems of our time. We must\r\nmake it possible for people to regain their faith. The United\r\nNations was created as a bond between peoples and nations.\r\nThe United Nations is essential if humanity is to rebuild its\r\nspiritual foundations.\r\nThe Holy Father’s presence is a reminder of the\r\nspiritual dimension of the United Nations. The United\r\nNations was created so that hope could conquer the horror\r\nof war. It was created so that compassion — the\r\ncompassion that all religions share — could conquer the\r\ndespair of poverty, disease and injustice. Hope enables us\r\nto continue our mission under the most adverse conditions.\r\nFaith enables us to continue the dialogue, to pursue\r\nnegotiation, even when a situation seems hopeless. Love\r\nenables us to continue development, to reach out to the less\r\nfortunate of our brothers and sisters.\r\nPope John Paul II has reflected deeply on the\r\ncomplex issues of our time. His message to the family of\r\nnations comes to us with clarity and conviction. His\r\nmessage is the kind of comprehensive vision which today\r\nwe require. Everything matters. Whether near or far,\r\neverything is interrelated. All that we do is done in\r\nrecognition that our work is inspired by something far\r\ngreater than ourselves.\r\nWith us today is one who has felt these issues at the\r\ndepth of the soul, and who has expressed them, in their\r\nessence, to the world. He rejoices with us, like the angel\r\nin the garden, and calls upon us to “be not afraid”. He\r\ntells us that we can and we must conquer fear if we are\r\nto solve the problems of our planet and its people.\r\nAll of us who serve the peoples of the United\r\nNations welcome to this Hall His Holiness Pope John\r\nPaul II.\r\nThe President: I now invite His Holiness Pope John\r\nPaul II to address the General Assembly.\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II: It is an honour for\r\nme to have the opportunity to address this international\r\nAssembly and to join men and women of every country,\r\nrace, language and culture in celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\r\nI wish to express my heartfelt gratitude in the first\r\nplace to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for having warmly encouraged this visit.\r\nAnd I thank you, Mr. President, for your cordial\r\nwelcome. I greet all of you, the members of this General\r\nAssembly; I am grateful for your presence and for your\r\nkind attention.\r\nOn the threshold of a new millennium we are\r\nwitnessing an extraordinary global acceleration of that\r\nquest for freedom which is one of the great dynamics of\r\nhuman history. This phenomenon is not limited to any\r\none part of the world, nor is it the expression of any\r\nsingle culture. Men and women throughout the world,\r\neven when threatened by violence, have taken the risk of\r\nfreedom, asking to be given a place in social, political\r\nand economic life commensurate with their dignity as free\r\nhuman beings. This universal longing for freedom is truly\r\none of the distinguishing marks of our time.\r\nIt is important for us to grasp what might be called\r\nthe inner structure of this worldwide movement. It is\r\nprecisely its global character which offers us its first and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nfundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed\r\nuniversal human rights rooted in the nature of the person,\r\nrights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of\r\na universal moral law. These are not abstract points; rather,\r\nthese rights tell us something important about the actual life\r\nof every individual and every social group. They also\r\nremind us that we do not live in an irrational and\r\nmeaningless world. On the contrary, there is a moral logic\r\nwhich is built into human life and which makes possible\r\ndialogue between individuals and peoples. If we want a\r\ncentury of violent coercion to be succeeded by a century of\r\npersuasion, we must find a way to discuss the human future\r\nintelligibly. The universal moral law written on the human\r\nheart is precisely that kind of grammar which is needed if\r\nthe world is to engage in this discussion of its future.\r\nThe moral dynamics of this universal quest for\r\nfreedom clearly appeared in Central and Eastern Europe\r\nduring the non-violent revolutions of 1989. Unfolding in\r\nspecific times and places, those historical events none the\r\nless taught a lesson which goes far beyond a specific\r\ngeographical location. For the non-violent revolutions of\r\n1989 demonstrated that the quest for freedom cannot be\r\nsuppressed. It arises from a recognition of the inestimable\r\ndignity and value of the human person, and it cannot fail to\r\nbe accompanied by a commitment on behalf of the human\r\nperson. Modern totalitarianism has been, first and foremost,\r\nan assault on the dignity of the person, an assault which has\r\ngone even to the point of denying the inalienable value of\r\nthe individual’s life. The revolutions of 1989 were made\r\npossible by the commitment of brave men and women\r\ninspired by a different, and ultimately more profound and\r\npowerful, vision: the vision of man as a creature of\r\nintelligence and free will, immersed in a mystery which\r\ntranscends his own being and endowed with the ability to\r\nreflect and the ability to choose, and thus capable of\r\nwisdom and virtue. A decisive factor in the success of those\r\nnonviolent revolutions was the experience of social\r\nsolidarity; in the face of regimes backed by the power of\r\npropaganda and terror, that solidarity was the moral core of\r\nthe power of the powerless, a beacon of hope and an\r\nenduring reminder that it is possible for man’s historical\r\njourney to follow a path which is true to the finest\r\naspirations of the human spirit.\r\nThe quest for freedom in the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century has engaged not only individuals, but\r\nnations as well. Fifty years after the end of the Second\r\nWorld War, it is important to remember that that war was\r\nfought because of violations of the rights of nations.\r\nUnfortunately, even after the end of the Second World War,\r\nthe rights of nations continued to be violated. To take but\r\none set of examples, the Baltic States and extensive\r\nterritories in Ukraine and Belarus were absorbed into the\r\nSoviet Union, as had already happened to Armenia,\r\nAzerbaijan and Georgia in the Caucasus. At the same\r\ntime, the so-called people’s democracies of Central and\r\nEastern Europe effectively lost their sovereignty and were\r\nrequired to submit to the will dominating the entire bloc.\r\nThe result of this artificial division of Europe was the\r\ncold war, a situation of international tension in which the\r\nthreat of a nuclear holocaust hung over humanity. It was\r\nonly when freedom was restored to the nations of Central\r\nand Eastern Europe that the promise of the peace which\r\nshould have come with the end of the war began to be\r\nrealized for many of the victims of that conflict.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted\r\nin 1948, spoke eloquently of the rights of persons, but no\r\nsimilar international agreement has yet adequately\r\naddressed the rights of nations. This situation must be\r\ncarefully pondered, for it raises urgent questions about\r\njustice and freedom in the world today. A study of these\r\nrights is certainly not easy, if we consider the difficulty\r\nof defining the very concept of “nation”, which cannot be\r\nidentified a priori and necessarily with a State. Such a\r\nstudy must none the less be made if we wish to avoid the\r\nerrors of the past and ensure a just world order.\r\nA presupposition of a nation’s rights is certainly its\r\nright to exist: therefore no one — neither a State, nor\r\nanother nation, nor an international organization — is\r\never justified in asserting that an individual nation is not\r\nworthy of existence. This fundamental right to existence\r\nnaturally implies that every nation also enjoys the right to\r\nits own language and culture, through which a people\r\nexpresses and promotes that which I would call its\r\nfundamental spiritual sovereignty. History shows that in\r\nextreme circumstances, such as those which occurred in\r\nthe land where I was born, it is precisely its culture that\r\nenables a nation to survive the loss of political and\r\neconomic independence. Every nation therefore has also\r\nthe right to shape its life according to its own traditions,\r\nexcluding, of course, every abuse of basic human rights\r\nand in particular the oppression of minorities. Every\r\nnation has the right to build its future by providing an\r\nappropriate education for the younger generation.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nDuring my pastoral pilgrimages to the communities\r\nof the Catholic Church over the past 17 years, I have\r\nbeen able to enter into dialogue with the rich diversity of\r\nnations and cultures in every part of the world.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nUnhappily, the world has yet to learn how to live with\r\ndiversity, as recent events in the Balkans and Central Africa\r\nhave painfully reminded us. The fact of “difference”, and\r\nthe reality of “the other”, can sometimes be felt as a\r\nburden, or even as a threat. Amplified by historic\r\ngrievances and exacerbated by the manipulations of the\r\nunscrupulous, the fear of “difference” can lead to a denial\r\nof the very humanity of “the other”, with the result that\r\npeople fall into a cycle of violence in which no one is\r\nspared, not even the children. We are all very familiar\r\ntoday with such situations; at this moment my heart and my\r\nprayers turn in a special way to the sufferings of the sorely\r\ntried peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nFrom bitter experience, then, we know that the fear of\r\n“difference”, especially when it expresses itself in a narrow\r\nand exclusive nationalism which denies any rights to “the\r\nother”, can lead to a true nightmare of violence and terror.\r\nAnd yet if we make the effort to look at matters\r\nobjectively, we can see that, transcending all the differences\r\nwhich distinguish individuals and peoples, there is a\r\nfundamental commonality. For different cultures are but\r\ndifferent ways of facing the question of the meaning of\r\npersonal existence. And it is precisely here that we find one\r\nsource of the respect which is due to every culture and\r\nevery nation: every culture is an effort to ponder the\r\nmystery of the world and in particular of the human person;\r\nit is a way of giving expression to the transcendent\r\ndimension of human life. The heart of every culture is its\r\napproach to the greatest of all mysteries: the mystery of\r\nGod.\r\nOur respect for the culture of others is therefore rooted\r\nin our respect for each community’s attempt to answer the\r\nquestion of human life. And here we can see how important\r\nit is to safeguard the fundamental right to freedom of\r\nreligion and freedom of conscience, as the cornerstones of\r\nthe structure of human rights and the foundation of every\r\ntruly free society. No one is permitted to suppress those\r\nrights by using coercive power to impose an answer to the\r\nmystery of man.\r\nWe need also to clarify the essential difference\r\nbetween an unhealthy form of nationalism, which teaches\r\ncontempt for other nations or cultures, and patriotism,\r\nwhich is a proper love of one’s country. True patriotism\r\nnever seeks to advance the well-being of one’s own nation\r\nat the expense of others. For in the end this would harm\r\none’s own nation as well: doing wrong damages both\r\naggressor and victim. Nationalism, particularly in its most\r\nradical forms, is thus the antithesis of true patriotism, and\r\ntoday we must ensure that extreme nationalism does not\r\ncontinue to give rise to new forms of the aberrations of\r\ntotalitarianism.\r\nFreedom is the measure of man’s dignity and\r\ngreatness. Living the freedom sought by individuals and\r\npeoples is a great challenge to man’s spiritual growth and\r\nto the moral vitality of nations. The basic question which\r\nwe must all face today is the responsible use of freedom,\r\nin both its personal and its social dimensions. Our\r\nreflection must turn, then, to the question of the moral\r\nstructure of freedom, which is the inner architecture of\r\nthe culture of freedom.\r\nFreedom is not simply the absence of tyranny or of\r\noppression. Nor is freedom a licence to do whatever we\r\nlike. Freedom has an inner logic which distinguishes it\r\nand ennobles it; freedom is ordered to the truth, and is\r\nfulfilled in man’s quest for truth and in man’s living in\r\nthe truth. Detached from the truth about the human\r\nperson, freedom deteriorates into licence in the lives of\r\nindividuals, and in political life it becomes the caprice of\r\nthe most powerful and the arrogance of power. Far from\r\nbeing a limitation upon freedom or a threat to it,\r\nreference to the truth about the human person — a truth\r\nuniversally knowable through the moral law written on\r\nthe hearts of all — is, in fact, the guarantor of freedom’s\r\nfuture.\r\nIn the light of what has been said, we understand\r\nhow utilitarianism, the doctrine which defines morality\r\nnot in terms of what is good, but of what is advantageous,\r\nthreatens the freedom of individuals and nations and\r\nobstructs the building of a true culture of freedom.\r\nUtilitarianism often has devastating political\r\nconsequences, because it inspires an aggressive\r\nnationalism on the basis of which the subjugation, for\r\nexample, of a smaller or weaker nation is claimed to be\r\na good thing solely because it corresponds to the national\r\ninterest. No less grave are the results of economic\r\nutilitarianism, which drives more powerful countries to\r\nmanipulate and exploit weaker ones.\r\nNationalistic and economic utilitarianism are\r\nsometimes combined, a phenomenon which has too often\r\ncharacterized relations between the North and the South.\r\nFor the emerging countries, the achievement of political\r\nindependence has too frequently been accompanied by a\r\nsituation of de facto economic dependence on other\r\ncountries. Such situations offend the conscience of\r\nhumanity and pose a formidable moral challenge to the\r\nhuman family.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\n(spoke in Russian)\r\nThe international economic scene needs an ethic of\r\nsolidarity, if participation, economic growth and a just\r\ndistribution of goods are to characterize the future of\r\nhumanity. The international cooperation called for by the\r\nCharter of the United Nations\r\n“in solving international problems of an economic,\r\nsocial, cultural, or humanitarian character”\r\ncannot be conceived exclusively in terms of help and\r\nassistance, or even by considering the eventual returns on\r\nthe resources provided. When millions of people are\r\nsuffering from a poverty which means hunger, malnutrition,\r\nsickness, illiteracy and degradation, we must not only\r\nremind ourselves that no one has a right to exploit another\r\nfor his own advantage, but also and above all must\r\nrecommit ourselves to that solidarity which enables others\r\nto live out, in the actual circumstances of their economic\r\nand political lives, the creativity which is a distinguishing\r\nmark of the human person and the true source of the wealth\r\nof nations in today’s world.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nAs we face these enormous challenges, how can we\r\nfail to acknowledge the role of the United Nations? The\r\nUnited Nations needs to rise more and more above the cold\r\nstatus of an administrative institution and become a moral\r\ncentre where all the nations of the world feel at home and\r\ndevelop a shared awareness of being, as it were, a family\r\nof nations. The idea of “family” immediately evokes\r\nsomething more than simple functional relations or a mere\r\nconvergence of interests. The family is by nature a\r\ncommunity based on mutual trust, mutual support and\r\nsincere respect. In an authentic family the strong do not\r\ndominate; instead, the weaker members, because of their\r\nvery weakness, are all the more welcomed and served.\r\nRaised to the level of the family of nations, these\r\nsentiments ought to be, even before law itself, the very\r\nfabric of relations between peoples. The United Nations has\r\nthe historic, even momentous, task of promoting this\r\nqualitative leap in international life, not only by serving as\r\na centre of effective mediation for the resolution of\r\nconflicts, but also by fostering values, attitudes and concrete\r\ninitiatives of solidarity capable of raising the level of\r\nrelations between nations from the organizational to a more\r\norganic level, from simple existence with others to\r\nexistence for others, in a fruitful exchange of gifts,\r\nprimarily for the good of the weaker nations, but even so\r\na clear harbinger of greater good for everyone.\r\nNone of this should appear an unattainable Utopia.\r\nNow is the time for new hope, which calls us to expel the\r\nparalysing burden of cynicism from the future of politics\r\nand of human life. The anniversary which we are\r\ncelebrating invites us to do this by reminding us of the\r\nidea of “united nations”, an idea which bespeaks mutual\r\ntrust, security and solidarity. Inspired by the example of\r\nall those who have taken the risk of freedom, can we not\r\nrecommit ourselves also to taking the risk of solidarity,\r\nand thus the risk of peace?\r\nIt is one of the great paradoxes of our time that man,\r\nwho began the period we call “modernity” with a\r\nself-confident assertion of his coming of age and his\r\nautonomy, approaches the end of the twentieth century\r\nfearful of himself, fearful of what he might be capable of,\r\nfearful for the future. Indeed, the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century has seen the unprecedented phenomenon\r\nof a humanity uncertain about the very likelihood of a\r\nfuture, given the threat of nuclear war. That danger,\r\nmercifully, appears to have receded, and everything that\r\nmight make it return needs to be rejected firmly and\r\nuniversally. All the same, fear for the future and of the\r\nfuture remains.\r\nIn order to ensure that the new millennium now\r\napproaching will witness a new flourishing of the human\r\nspirit, mediated through an authentic culture of freedom,\r\nmen and women must learn to conquer fear. We must\r\nlearn not to be afraid; we must rediscover a spirit of hope\r\nand a spirit of trust. Hope is not empty optimism\r\nspringing from a naive confidence that the future will\r\nnecessarily be better than the past. Hope and trust are the\r\npremise of responsible activity and are nurtured in that\r\ninner sanctuary of conscience where “man is alone with\r\nGod” and thus perceives that he is not alone amid the\r\nenigmas of existence, for he is surrounded by the love of\r\nthe Creator.\r\nHope and trust: these may seem matters beyond the\r\npurview of the United Nations. But they are not. The\r\npolitics of nations, with which this Organization is\r\nprincipally concerned, can never ignore the transcendent,\r\nspiritual dimension of the human experience, and could\r\nnever ignore it without harming the cause of man and the\r\ncause of human freedom. Whatever diminishes man\r\nharms the cause of freedom. In order to recover our hope\r\nand our trust at the end of this century of sorrows, we\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nmust regain sight of that transcendent horizon of possibility\r\nto which the soul of man aspires.\r\nAs a Christian, I cannot fail to affirm that my hope\r\nand trust are centred on Jesus Christ, the two thousandth\r\nanniversary of whose birth will be celebrated at the coming\r\nof the new millennium. We Christians believe that in his\r\ndeath and resurrection were fully revealed God’s love and\r\nhis care for all creation. Jesus Christ is for us God made\r\nman, and made a part of the history of humanity. Precisely\r\nfor this reason, Christian hope for the world and its future\r\nextends to every human person. Nothing genuinely human\r\nfails to touch the hearts of Christians. Thus, as we approach\r\nthe two thousandth anniversary of the birth of Christ, the\r\nChurch asks only to be able to propose respectfully this\r\nmessage of salvation, and to be able to promote, in charity\r\nand service, the solidarity of the entire human family.\r\nWe must overcome our fear of the future. But we will\r\nnot be able to overcome it completely unless we do so\r\ntogether. The answer to that fear is neither coercion nor\r\nrepression, nor the imposition of one social model on the\r\nentire world. The answer to the fear which darkens human\r\nexistence at the end of the century is the common effort to\r\nbuild a civilization of love, founded on the universal values\r\nof peace, solidarity, justice and liberty. And the soul of the\r\ncivilization of love is the culture of freedom: the freedom\r\nof individuals and the freedom of nations, lived in\r\nself-giving solidarity and responsibility.\r\nWe must not be afraid of the future. We must not be\r\nafraid of man. It is no accident that we are here. Each and\r\nevery human person has been created in the image and\r\nlikeness of the One who is the origin of all that is. We\r\nhave within us the capacities for wisdom and virtue. With\r\nthese gifts, and with the help of God’s grace, we can\r\nbuild in the next century and the next millennium a\r\ncivilization worthy of the human person, a true culture of\r\nfreedom. We can and must do so. And in doing so we\r\nshall see that the tears of this century have prepared the\r\nground for a new springtime of the human spirit.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI should like to express a small greeting in Arabic\r\nand in Chinese.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nMay the United Nations contribute to the building of\r\ngenuine peace and the prosperity of the human family.\r\n(spoke in Chinese)\r\nI wish freedom, peace and coexistence for all the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nMay all live in dignity, freedom and genuine peace.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly\r\nI wish to express our deep appreciation to His Holiness\r\nPope John Paul II for his important and inspiring\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall by the President and the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.\r\n6\r\n"
