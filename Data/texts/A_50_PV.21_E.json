(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Azerbaijan, His Excellency, Mr. Hassan\r\nHassanov.\r\nMr. Kouliev (Azerbaijan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Mr. President, my Foreign Minister has asked me\r\nto read out his statement on his behalf.\r\n“Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to\r\ncongratulate you upon your election to the important\r\npost of President of this historic fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that, under your\r\nskilful leadership, the General Assembly will write\r\none more significant page in the chronicles of the\r\nUnited Nations. I should also like to express my\r\ngratitude to your distinguished predecessor, Mr.\r\nAmara Essy, for his valuable contribution to the work\r\nof the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\n“I should like to express particular words of\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts to strengthen\r\npeace on Earth.\r\n“We have gathered here on this fiftieth\r\nanniversary year of the existence of the United\r\nNations, understanding as we do the tremendous\r\nsignificance of the role played by our Organization\r\nin the world today. All progressive people welcomed\r\nthe end of the cold war, rightly believing that it\r\nwould lead to an easing of nuclear confrontation and\r\nan improvement of the political climate on the\r\nplanet. However, the dissolution of totalitarian\r\nsystems entailed the emergence of bloody armed\r\nconflicts and hot spots around the world.\r\n“The world has witnessed with tremendous\r\nalarm the continuing military confrontations and\r\ntension in the republics of the former Yugoslavia,\r\nTajikistan and the Nagorny Karabakh region of\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\n“For seven years now we have seen open\r\naggression from the Republic of Armenia against the\r\nAzerbaijan Republic. Twenty per cent of Azerbaijan\r\nterritory has been under occupation by the armed\r\nforces of the Republic of Armenia. More than one\r\nmillion Azerbaijanis have been forcibly driven from\r\ntheir homes. A serious hotbed of tension has been\r\ncreated in the region and threatens international\r\npeace and security.\r\n“The Security Council has adopted four\r\nresolutions on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict in\r\nwhich it called upon the aggressor to withdraw,\r\nimmediately and totally, from the occupied\r\nterritories. However, the Republic of Armenia has\r\ncompletely ignored compliance with the resolutions\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nand as a Member of the United Nations is, in effect,\r\nrefusing to follow the decisions of one of its major\r\norgans.\r\n“Almost a year has elapsed since the adoption in\r\nBudapest by the Heads of State and Government,\r\nmembers of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), of a decision\r\nappointing the co-chairmen of the Minsk Conference\r\non the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict\r\ndesigned to ensure the signing of a major political\r\nagreement the realization of which should eliminate all\r\nthe consequences of the conflict. However, in this case\r\nthe Republic of Armenia is pursuing a policy of\r\nputting forward obviously unacceptable conditions and\r\nattempting to impose provisions which would impose\r\nin advance a political status on the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nregion of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Here we are\r\nfaced with attempts to intimidate us with the\r\npossibility of the undermining of the peace-keeping\r\noperation in the region. It is, to say the least, unethical\r\nto accuse the victim of aggression, of not being\r\nwilling to compromise on the problem of the\r\nliberation of its occupied territories.\r\n“Azerbaijan, for its part, is continuously\r\ndisplaying its readiness for constructive cooperation\r\nwith the mediators in order to bring about a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict.\r\n“We have repeatedly expressed ourselves in\r\nfavour of a multinational peace-keeping operation of\r\nthe OSCE for the maintenance of peace on the border\r\nbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia and in the region as\r\na whole.\r\n“At the present time discussions are taking place\r\non the mandate and parameters of the peace-\r\nkeeping operations of that Organization. In connection\r\nwith the fact that the peace-keeping operation in our\r\nregion will be the first to be carried out by the OSCE,\r\nAzerbaijan has agreed to the provision of technical\r\nexpert consultative assistance from the United Nations\r\nfor the success of this operation.\r\n“Azerbaijan shares the general understanding that\r\npeace-keeping operations should be viewed as\r\ntemporary in nature and should be used to promote a\r\nclimate to facilitate the settlement of a particular\r\nproblem. At the same time, however, we must not lose\r\nsight of the fact that settlement is the ultimate goal. In\r\nimplementing any peace-keeping operation we must\r\nstrictly abide by the principles contained in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, particularly the principles of\r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nStates and non-intervention in internal affairs.\r\n“Peace-keeping operations must be based on an\r\nappropriate mandate drawn up with the consent of\r\nall the parties involved, and they must be impartial,\r\nobjective and neutral in character. Azerbaijan agrees\r\nwith the current and established international\r\npractice under which the military contingent of any\r\ncountry participating in a given peace-keeping\r\noperation should not exceed 30 per cent of the total\r\nfor the force. It is also important for the\r\ninternational organs involved in peace-keeping\r\noperations to furnish all available information to\r\nStates and to keep world public opinion informed of\r\nthe progress of the operation.\r\n“The settlement of the conflict between\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan entails strict compliance\r\nwith these principles. Failing the liberation of all\r\nAzerbaijani territory occupied by Armenia, there can\r\nbe no question of any comprehensive settlement of\r\nthis conflict. Restoration of the territorial integrity of\r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan and the return of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons to their homes in\r\naccordance with international practice are the only\r\nbases on which a solution can be found to the\r\nproblem of the Armenian national minority\r\npopulation in Azerbaijan.\r\n“In the context of a settlement of the\r\nArmenian-Azerbaijani conflict I should also like to\r\ndraw attention to the principle of the right of peoples\r\nto self-determination, a principle that the Republic of\r\nArmenia is flouting. The world has not yet found a\r\nworkable balance between the principle of the right\r\nof peoples to self-determination, on the one hand,\r\nand the principle of the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of States, on the other. Nevertheless, it is\r\nclear that the right to self-determination, as\r\ncontained in the Charter, is not intended to furnish\r\na pretext for flouting the principle of independence\r\nand territorial integrity.\r\n“The Republic of Azerbaijan, now a full-\r\nfledged member of the world community, has\r\nundertaken to abide by all universally recognized\r\nnorms and principles of international law in its\r\nrelations with other States. The Republic of\r\nArmenia, however, has persistently attempted to use\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nthe principle of the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination as a pretext to legitimize and\r\nconsolidate its territorial claims and to justify its\r\naggression against Azerbaijan and its occupation of\r\nAzerbaijani territory. Indeed, the expansionist circles\r\nin Armenia have been implementing such a policy for\r\nyears. In 1988, when the Soviet Union was still in\r\nexistence, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic\r\nexpelled its Azerbaijani population — some 200,000\r\npersons, a national minority. Immediately following\r\nthat inhuman decision, the Parliament of Armenia,\r\nacting counter to all the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law, approved Armenia’s annexation of\r\nthe Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan — in\r\nother words, it decided to annex a part of the territory\r\nof a neighbouring State.\r\n“Subsequently, 50,000 persons were expelled\r\nfrom the Nagorny Karabakh region, whose total\r\npopulation numbered 170,000, with the financial and\r\nmilitary support of the Republic of Armenia. In\r\naddition, Armenian armed forces were used to\r\nconsolidate the annexation of the Lachin and Shusha\r\ndistricts of Azerbaijan, through which the Republic of\r\nArmenia maintains direct communication with the\r\nNagorny Karabakh region of the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan. Through this corridor, cynically referred\r\nto as a humanitarian corridor, a river of weapons,\r\nammunitions and human resources flows from the\r\nRepublic of Armenia. Some 20 per cent of the\r\nterritory of Azerbaijan is now occupied by Armenian\r\narmed forces. Again, this armed expansion is\r\naccompanied by a thorough ethnic cleansing\u0027 of the\r\noccupied Azerbaijani territories and a scorched-earth\r\npolicy.\r\n“The world community must condemn the\r\nactions of Armenia in Azerbaijan and call for the full\r\nand unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armed\r\nforces from the occupied territories and for the return\r\nof refugees and displaced persons to their homes. This\r\nis clearly a case in which we are witnessing a total\r\ndisregard for the provision of the United Nations\r\nCharter that calls upon all Member States\r\nto refrain in their international relations from\r\nthe threat or use of force against the territorial\r\nintegrity or political independence of any State,\r\nor in any other manner inconsistent with the\r\nPurposes of the United Nations.\u0027\r\nWorld public opinion must not be misled as to the\r\ntrue motives for the actions of Armenia, which is\r\ncloaking its aggression against Azerbaijan in the\r\nlofty principle of the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\n“Armenia’s aggression against Azerbaijan has\r\ncaused enormous suffering and grief to the whole of\r\nthe Azerbaijani people, who have been forced by the\r\nmilitary actions and occupation of the Armenian\r\narmed forces to leave their homes, abandon their\r\nproperty and flee in order to avoid falling into the\r\nhands of the occupiers. The Azerbaijani Government\r\nhas been forced to convert many schools, dwellings,\r\nsanatoriums and rest homes into housing for\r\nrefugees and displaced persons. In the territory of\r\nAzerbaijan, people are forced to take refuge in tent\r\ncities. The normal life of the country has been\r\nalmost totally destroyed.\r\n“We are grateful to the countries and\r\ninternational and non-governmental organizations\r\nthat have lent active humanitarian assistance to\r\nAzerbaijan. The United Nations too has played an\r\nimportant role in this assistance. The activities of the\r\n1995-1996 humanitarian programmes, as presented\r\nin the United Nations consolidated inter-agency\r\nhumanitarian assistance appeal for the Caucasus,\r\ninclude relief projects in the food, non-food, shelter,\r\neducation and health sectors. However, as the\r\nSecretary-General indicates in his annual report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, only 37 per cent, or\r\n$12.8 million, of the requirements pledged for\r\nhumanitarian activities in Azerbaijan had been\r\nreceived as at 31 July 1995. Other projects carried\r\nout under the aegis of the United Nations have\r\naddressed capacity-building and the transition from\r\nemergency assistance to development.\r\n“Azerbaijan has always attached great\r\nimportance to multifaceted cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations system in the spheres of social and\r\neconomic development. Following the dissolution of\r\nthe USSR our country was confronted with the task\r\nof radically restructuring the Azerbaijani economy\r\non a free-market basis. No country can be expected\r\nto undertake such a radical restructuring unilaterally\r\nwithout the active cooperation of international\r\norganizations, and Azerbaijan has been no exception.\r\nSo far, we can point with some satisfaction to the\r\ncontinued cooperation between the Government of\r\nAzerbaijan and such important international financial\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\ninstitutions as the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment. We have had considerable success in\r\nstabilizing the exchange rate of the manat, our national\r\ncurrency. The Government of Azerbaijan has received\r\napproval of sizeable loans to assist in a number of\r\nmajor infrastructure projects and for drilling and\r\ntransporting oil.\r\n“Although the majority of the contacts between\r\nAzerbaijan and the United Nations system have been\r\nsuccessful, we must nevertheless mention some\r\ncurrent problems. We have not yet been able to\r\nresolve the question of a proper scale for Azerbaijan’s\r\ncontribution to the regular budget of the Organization\r\nthat would reflect my country’s real ability to pay.\r\n“In Azerbaijan’s brief period of independence\r\nsome important changes have occurred. The Republic\r\nof Azerbaijan has begun to build its free democratic\r\nsociety on the basis of a market economy. We shall\r\ncontinue to pursue that path. It goes without saying,\r\nhowever, that the transition from one social and\r\neconomic system to another requires a certain amount\r\nof time and very careful and meticulous work.\r\n“We need fundamental changes in many aspects\r\nof the life of the Republic, and corresponding changes\r\nin the thinking of our people. After long stagnation,\r\nthe people have achieved civic freedom; now, they\r\nmust understand that freedom. This is one of our most\r\nimportant areas of activity. A certain amount of\r\nprogress has been made with respect to the political\r\nlife of Azerbaijan. The principles of political\r\npluralism, personal freedoms and freedom of\r\nexpression, of the press and of conscience are\r\nguaranteed. Human rights are effectively protected. A\r\nmulti-party system is at work. We consistently act on\r\nthe principle of the primacy of law. Irrespective of sex\r\nor national, religious, ethnic or linguistic affiliation,\r\ncitizens of Azerbaijan enjoy equal rights.\r\n“Azerbaijan’s highest legislative body, the Milli\r\nMajlis, has adopted a new electoral law, which is a\r\nmilestone in the development of a democratic society\r\nin our country. This law is a further example of how\r\nAzerbaijan is proceeding with the building of a\r\ndemocratic civil society. Parliamentary elections in\r\nAzerbaijan are scheduled for 12 November this year;\r\nthis confirms our unswerving policy of strengthening\r\nindependence and sovereignty. Many countries and\r\nmajor international organizations, including the United\r\nNations, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and others, have already\r\nagreed to act as observers of the elections. I take\r\nthis opportunity to invite States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to send observers to the elections in\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\n“In the social and economic sphere, our\r\npurposeful reforms in the political area and towards\r\na democratic society have made it possible to create\r\nthe preconditions for economic and social change,\r\nwhich is proceeding with success in our country and\r\nwhich is laying the foundation for an early transition\r\nto market relationships. The Republic has achieved\r\na certain stabilization of macro-economic indicators\r\nand is doing all it can to encourage the development\r\nof free enterprise. We have begun a conscientious\r\nprogramme of privatization. Inflation, which had in\r\nprevious years reached 30 to 35 per cent per month,\r\nhas now been reduced to near zero. We appeal to\r\nthe international community and to foreign\r\nbusinesses to increase their investment in the\r\neconomy of Azerbaijan. We have created all the\r\nproper conditions for profitable activities by foreign\r\ncompanies. International consortiums are stepping up\r\ntheir activities; in addition to the Azerbaijan State oil\r\ncompany, these include major transnational\r\ncorporations. These activities are aimed at joint\r\nexploration and development of oil and gas deposits\r\nin the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea.\r\n“The 50 years of the United Nations have\r\nshown that the peoples of the world can achieve a\r\ngreat deal when they combine their efforts and their\r\nwill to defend world peace and to achieve the\r\nprosperity of peoples. We know that it was concern\r\nwith preventing another world war that ordained the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations, and this remains\r\nthe main task before mankind today. For war annuls\r\nall that the efforts of peoples have achieved.”\r\nThe President: I call next on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Worship of Costa Rica, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Fernando Naranjo Villalobos.\r\nMr. Naranjo Villalobos (Costa Rica) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): It is the honour of the delegation of Costa\r\nRica to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this historic\r\nsession marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. We are extremely pleased that a distinguished\r\nson of Portugal, a country so closely linked to Latin\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nAmerica by history and culture, has been chosen for this\r\nhigh position. We offer you our full cooperation in the\r\nperformance of your important duties.\r\nWe wish to express to Member States the gratitude of\r\nthe Government and the people of Costa Rica for having\r\nelected our country to one of the vice-presidencies of the\r\nAssembly. That election is a significant honour.\r\nIt also gives me pleasure to join previous speakers in\r\nthanking the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for the splendid way in\r\nwhich he performed his duties as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\r\nCosta Rica wishes to convey its recognition of the\r\nindefatigable work carried out by the Secretary-General and\r\nby other Secretariat officials towards peace and security.\r\nThe devoted efforts of the Secretary-General to champion\r\na safer, fairer, more peaceful and more humane world for\r\nfuture generations will be a great legacy for mankind, along\r\nwith his determination to transform and modernize the\r\nOrganization and carry it into the future.\r\nFifty years ago, Mr. Julio Acosta, former President of\r\nthe Republic and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Costa\r\nRica, who headed our country’s delegation to the United\r\nNations Conference on International Organization at San\r\nFrancisco, said that the future of the world lay with the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, which was the most\r\nimportant human document of the last 1,000 years. That,\r\nindeed, is what it has been, at least over the last 50 years,\r\ndespite the many difficulties, the many frustrations, the\r\nmany conflicts. The Charter of the United Nations has set\r\na new course for mankind and has provided the\r\ninternational community with an ethical code that grows\r\nstronger every day.\r\nCosta Rica, a founding Member of the Organization,\r\nis firmly committed to the United Nations, in accordance\r\nwith its long-standing regime of democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights. The values and principles which give shape\r\nto this Organization were an integral part of Costa Rican\r\nlife many years before the San Francisco Conference. With\r\nthe abolition of the armed forces in 1948, our country\r\nrenewed its faith in law and its hope that reason, not force,\r\nwould govern relations among human beings. With that\r\ndecision of President José Figueres, Costa Rica addressed\r\nthe world and declared peace. With the same thought in\r\nmind, the Government of Costa Rica has promoted many\r\nUnited Nations initiatives in support of peace and human\r\nrights, including the establishment of the University for\r\nPeace, the declaration of the International Year of Peace\r\nand the creation of the office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. All these ideas are\r\naimed at realizing mankind’s dream of sustainable peace.\r\nIn the spirit of commemorating in deeds the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Organization, Costa Rica proposed a\r\nWorld Week of Peace, to begin on 24 October this year.\r\nThis initiative, sponsored by a large number of countries\r\nand unanimously adopted by the General Assembly on\r\n12 July 1995, would silence weapons everywhere in the\r\nworld for at least a week, so that in the future sustainable\r\npeace might prevail over destructive war. Costa Rica\r\nhopes that during the Week all Member States will carry\r\nout pro-peace activities and reflect on how important it is\r\nfor mankind to learn to live under the sign of concord.\r\nMy delegation is aware of the practical constraints that\r\nstand in the way of the World Week of Peace achieving\r\nits goals on the desired scale. However, it is our belief\r\nthat any move that could be taken this week to promote\r\ndialogue, coexistence and harmony between nations would\r\nbe a valuable contribution to the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and to the building of\r\nthe future. The effort will have been worthwhile if even\r\none human being — a child, a woman or a man — is\r\nsaved from death as a result of this initiative.\r\nThere are no conflicts without solutions. All ground\r\nis fertile for reconciliation. How many tears were shed in\r\nSouth Africa, how much blood was spilled in the Middle\r\nEast! However, animosity has gradually disappeared and\r\nharmony is beginning to flourish. Multicultural democracy\r\nis giving a new and peaceful direction to the history of\r\nSouth Africa. With the recent agreement on the West\r\nBank, Israelis and Palestinians continue to show that\r\npeace is always possible. If there is a will for peace,\r\npeace can be achieved. In that context, the United Nations\r\nmust continue to be the forum where all the peoples of\r\nthe world have fair representation. No country should be\r\nexcluded from becoming a Member of this Organization.\r\nFor many years, the world prevented a general\r\nconflagration by resorting to containment. Today,\r\nalthough the East-West confrontation has dissipated, and\r\npreventive diplomacy is making headway, there are still\r\nlatent seeds of world conflict, concentrated in the sub-\r\nhuman conditions in which a large portion of the world’s\r\npopulation live, and evident also in the massive decay of\r\nthe environment.\r\nThe urgent need to solve senseless conflicts such as\r\nthe one in the former Yugoslavia and to end the violence\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nbesetting so many places in the world should not make us\r\nlose sight of the fact that true peace involves a series of\r\nelements much more significant than the mere absence of\r\nwar. As has been recently stated by His Holiness Pope John\r\nPaul II, who offered to the world such a beautiful message\r\nof hope and goodwill today from this Hall,\r\n“... peace is not limited to the silence of cannons. It is\r\nnourished with justice and freedom. It needs the\r\natmosphere of a spirit rich in some fundamental\r\nelements, such as the sense of God, the taste for\r\nbeauty, the love of truth, the choice of solidarity, and\r\nthe capacity for tenderness and the courage to\r\nforgive.”\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization is an\r\noccasion for reflection, but we should also use it to\r\nmeditate on the challenge of our times: to achieve\r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn Central America we have committed ourselves\r\nfirmly to a comprehensive peace process and\r\ndemocratization, in a regional effort to build peace and\r\ndemocracy where these are needed, and to strengthen them\r\nwhere they already exist. This journey is culminating today\r\nin the encouraging advances experienced in the dialogue in\r\nGuatemala. Costa Rica is optimistic about the efforts to find\r\na lasting peaceful solution to the problem involving that\r\nbrotherly country. We give our full support to the\r\nnegotiation process being developed to that end under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations.\r\nCentral Americans, who for many years have\r\nsuccessfully advocated this process of peace and\r\ndemocratization, are today also committed to an alliance to\r\ngenerate in our region a new model of development,\r\ncombining freedom and the well-being of the vast majority,\r\nwith respect for the natural environment. This Central\r\nAmerican commitment to the region itself and to the\r\ninternational community is being implemented through\r\nvarious actions and development projects. We hope that the\r\ninternational community as a whole will understand and\r\nappreciate Central America’s effort, and will lend it its\r\nsupport, as several friendly nations have already done.\r\nAs an integral part of the process of the consolidation\r\nof peace and the building of sustainable development,\r\nrespect for human rights is no longer just a legal and moral\r\nobligation of Governments; it has become an essential\r\ncondition for harmonious life in every society. However,\r\nwe cannot disregard the fact that many situations in which\r\nthese rights are still ignored or violated persist, making the\r\ntask of the relevant international bodies doubly important.\r\nIt is not legal to violate human rights, but it is not right\r\nto sit idly by, using the pretext of respect for sovereignty,\r\nwhich is only hypothetical respect and borders on\r\ncomplicity.\r\nFor Costa Rica, a party to the International\r\nCovenants on this matter and the headquarters of the\r\nInter-American Court of Human Rights, it is essential that\r\nthe United Nations assume a more dynamic and energetic\r\nrole in the protection of fundamental human rights and\r\nrequire from Member States strict compliance with their\r\nresponsibilities in this area. For this purpose, protective\r\nentities, in particular the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), should be\r\nprovided with more resources. We must also strengthen\r\nmeasures against States which ignore the\r\nrecommendations of those bodies, or prevent them from\r\nperforming their duties.\r\nWe are also concerned that overcoming the balance\r\nof terror has not put an end to the arms race, and that is\r\na matter of concern to us. We cannot understand why at\r\nthis time in history there are still countries which, with\r\nsurprising levity, destroy the environment and endanger\r\ntheir neighbours with nuclear tests. This is a flagrant\r\nviolation of the commitments that marked the conclusion\r\nof the negotiations to extend the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and has a negative\r\neffect on the tasks related to the drafting of the\r\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. Costa Rica has\r\nnever possessed, and does not want to possess, nuclear or\r\nchemical weapons, and strongly urges participant States\r\nto speedily conclude negotiations on this treaty and to\r\nensure that it takes effect as soon as possible.\r\nHowever, the danger of a nuclear holocaust should\r\nnot make us unconcerned about the problems caused by\r\nconventional weapons, the traffic in which has a tragic\r\nimpact on the third world and keeps a series of very\r\nharmful conflicts alive. Many Governments of\r\nunderdeveloped countries continue to waste resources on\r\nweapons, resources needed desperately by their own\r\npeople for basic necessities. The democracies of the\r\nindustrialized world continue providing those weapons in\r\na business which undoubtedly, on a short-term basis, is\r\nfinancially more profitable than cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn 1994, relying on an initiative of the Government\r\nof Romania, a group of 25 countries proposed to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the adoption of a voluntary, global and\r\nnon-discriminatory code of conduct for the international\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\ntransfer of weapons. My delegation believes that this\r\nsubject must be reactivated without delay and also that\r\nconcrete action must be taken to make the Register of\r\nConventional Weapons within the United Nations effective.\r\nThe reduction of military spending has an immediate\r\nrepercussion on budget allocations for the promotion of\r\ndevelopment and well-being. In Costa Rica, we learned this\r\nlesson almost half a century ago and we have had no\r\nreason since then to regret our decision. However, we also\r\nbelieve that providing special treatment, such as cooperation\r\nfor development and the transfer of technology for peaceful\r\npurposes, to countries which reduce military spending\r\nwould be a great incentive, as has been suggested by Oscar\r\nArias, a former President of Costa Rica and a Nobel Peace\r\nPrize Laureate in 1987.\r\nIn the spirit of building a new world, a world better\r\nthan the one that existed 50 years ago, the international\r\ncommunity has the duty to promote changes in the area of\r\ninternational economic relations.\r\nIn recent years, there have been significant\r\nreformulations in international trade plans. A World Trade\r\nOrganization has been created to replace the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, and there has been a\r\nproliferation of regional free-trade plans. However, this has\r\nnot dissipated the worrying trends towards protectionism\r\nthat are increasingly being developed by industrialized\r\nnations. While the underdeveloped countries are applying\r\nprogrammes with a view to the adjustment and the opening\r\nup of trade, the richest countries are imposing burdensome\r\nlimitations on trade. My delegation considers that the ninth\r\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), to be held in South Africa in\r\n1996, must become a fundamental forum for the discussion\r\nof these problems.\r\nSince the first meeting of UNCTAD, held in Geneva\r\nin 1964, 77 countries of the Third World have joined in\r\ndemanding more equitable conditions in regard to world\r\ntrade. The fight for this new international economic order\r\nhas today become a priority because, even though the\r\nmilitary-political blocs which divided the world in the\r\nrecent past have now disappeared, the gap between North\r\nand South is becoming ever greater. In the circumstances,\r\nwe consider that the presidency of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, to which Costa Rica was appointed a few days ago,\r\nis not only a great honour but also an important\r\nresponsibility. Costa Rica is deeply grateful for the support\r\nit received in achieving this significant position and we\r\nhope that in the performance of our duties we will make a\r\nconstructive contribution towards the launching of the\r\nGroup of 77 into the new international realities.\r\nFor some years now, it has been suggested that there\r\nis a need to redesign the United Nations in order to give\r\nthe Organization a new look in keeping with a different\r\nworld situation. Costa Rica, on various occasions, has\r\nexpressed its support for initiatives in this area, including\r\nthe suggestion that Germany and Japan should become\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, and that we\r\nshould guarantee permanent representation for all regions\r\nin that body. Today, on the occasion of the celebration of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary, we wish to reiterate Costa Rica’s\r\nfirm commitment to the renovation of the United Nations.\r\nIt is urgent to take steps along the lines pointed out by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his “An Agenda for Peace” and\r\n“An Agenda for Development”, and it is important that\r\nthe international system should comply with the\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the mandates of\r\nthe Security Council. It is also essential to provide a\r\nfollow-up to, and implement, the commitments made at\r\nthe Rio, Copenhagen and Beijing conferences.\r\nIn celebrating the fifty years of its existence, the\r\nUnited Nations is still young. It remains young because\r\nits spirit is still generously irrigated with idealism and\r\nwith faith in mankind. The Organization remains young\r\nbecause it still believes that the human being has a greater\r\ncapacity to convince than to shoot, to love than to hate,\r\nto build than to destroy, to procreate than to kill.\r\nLet us preserve this essence of youth in our\r\nOrganization. In 1995, as in 1945, in spite of\r\ndisappointments, bitter days and years, the United Nations\r\nrepresents the hope that there will be a future for our\r\nchildren. The United Nations is the most important\r\ndemonstration that there will be a future because the\r\nwords uttered in this Hall many years ago by the then\r\nForeign Minister and later President of Costa Rica, Daniel\r\nOduber, are still valid. He said that the United Nations\r\nhad revealed itself to be the only entity capable of\r\nminimizing the sufferings which, alternating with the\r\nsatisfaction of being alive and of performing our duties,\r\nwere the common lot of mankind.\r\nI would conclude with the inspiring words uttered by\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II in this Hall this morning,\r\n“The answer to the fear which darkens human\r\nexistence at the end of the century is the common\r\neffort to build a civilization of love, founded on the\r\nuniversal values of peace, solidarity, justice and\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nliberty.” (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 20th meeting, p. 6).\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Iraq, His Excellency Mr. Mohammed Saeed\r\nAl-Sahaf.\r\nMr. Al-Sahaf (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): I am\r\npleased to begin my statement by extending to you sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\r\npresent session of the General Assembly. I am confident\r\nthat your high competence and profound experience will\r\ncontribute effectively to the success of the work of the\r\npresent historic session.\r\nThis session coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nour Organization. There is no doubt that such an important\r\noccasion calls for examining the course the Organization\r\nhas taken in order to draw the best object-lessons that\r\nwould enable the international community to proceed to the\r\nbuilding of a better future in which peace and stability\r\nwould prevail on the basis of justice, the balance of\r\ninterests of all peoples and genuine international\r\ncooperation that would be free from selfishness and\r\nhegemony; a future which would open the doors towards\r\nthe solution of economic, social, cultural and humanitarian\r\nproblems that continue to cause suffering to the\r\noverwhelming majority of States, especially in Asia, Africa\r\nand Latin America.\r\nMembers of the international community welcomed\r\nthe end of the cold war. They view it as the harbinger of a\r\nnew age. However, many representatives of many Member\r\nStates did point out the dangers of imbalance in\r\ninternational relations. They warned that the supremacy of\r\none super-Power would make international life hostage to\r\nthat Power and, thereby, lead to the imposition of its views,\r\ninterests and policies on the rest of the world. The\r\ncorrecting of this imbalance in the international situation\r\nrequires a great deal of care in upholding equality between\r\nStates, restructuring the United Nations in line with well-\r\nbalanced formulas, revitalizing the work of its institutions\r\nin a manner that would ensure balance and genuine\r\nparticipation in responsibility, prevent hegemony by one or\r\ncertain parties over the international community and over\r\nthe United Nations with its institutions. Although these\r\nobjectives have not been achieved so far, to work towards\r\ntheir achievement and to develop an understanding of what\r\nthey involved continue to be urgent needs of the highest\r\npriority.\r\nMr. Camacho Omiste (Bolivia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe believe that the imposition of a unipolar\r\nstandpoint on the work of the United Nations totally\r\ncontradicts the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nThe persistence of such attempts would lead only to more\r\nanxiety and deterioration in international relations.\r\nThis conviction stems from Iraq’s actual experience\r\nover the past five years. It is an experience that relates to\r\nthe implementation of the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil on the so-called Gulf Crisis, and especially the\r\nimplementation of resolution 687 (1991).\r\nThat resolution imposed upon Iraq a number of\r\nobligations, as a basis for a comprehensive settlement of\r\nthe situation. A few days after the adoption of the\r\nresolution, Iraq informed the Security Council of its\r\nreadiness to comply with the provisions of the resolution\r\ndespite the harsh nature of the obligations imposed\r\nthereby. Since that date, Iraq has seriously taken upon\r\nitself the implementation of the resolution in order to\r\nnormalize the situation at the regional and international\r\nlevels. In fact, a great many steps have taken place in\r\nimplementing the resolution. Our people hope that what\r\nhas been achieved will be the subject of an objective and\r\nfair evaluation by the Security Council that would lead to\r\nthe lifting of the embargo imposed upon Iraq for more\r\nthan five years now.\r\nAllow me to review very briefly the steps\r\ntaken by Iraq in the context of implementing the\r\nobligations imposed by the Security Council in\r\nresolution 687 (1991).\r\nOn 10 November 1994, Iraq officially recognized the\r\nsovereignty, the territorial integrity and the political\r\nindependence of the State of Kuwait, and the international\r\nboundary demarcated by the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\r\nBoundary Demarcation Commission. This was done in\r\nimplementation of resolutions 687 (1991) and 833 (1993).\r\nIraq has cooperated also with the representatives of\r\nthe United Nations in returning Kuwaiti property on the\r\nbasis of the lists presented through the United Nations\r\ncoordinator. In this connection, Iraq affirmed that it will\r\nreturn any item of property that would be found when it\r\nis established that it belongs to Kuwait.\r\nAs regards the prisoners of war and the missing\r\npersons, Iraq, in implementation of Security Council\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nresolutions 686 (1991) and 687(1991), released all prisoners\r\nof war and detainees who were in Iraq and repatriated them\r\nin cooperation with the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC). As for investigating the fate of missing\r\npersons, we are cooperating fully within the framework of\r\nthe joint work carried out under the auspices of the ICRC\r\nby the Tripartite Commission and its Technical\r\nSubcommittee on Military and Civilian Missing Prisoners\r\nof War and Mortal Remains. Since the middle of 1994,\r\nwhen we found the appropriate modality for effective\r\ntechnical work in dealing with this humanitarian problem,\r\nwe have sought within the said framework to provide\r\nanswers to the questions raised in the individual inquiry\r\nfiles presented to us on the basis of the available\r\ninformation. Moreover, Iraq has been receptive to all the\r\ninitiatives of States and personalities to find a quick\r\nsolution to this humanitarian problem in accordance with\r\nthe Geneva Conventions.\r\nWith regard to the subject of compensation, Iraq\r\naccepted the principle of responsibility in accordance with\r\ninternational law to compensate direct damage resulting\r\nfrom the events in Kuwait as stated in resolution 687\r\n(1991).\r\nIraq has cooperated also with the United Nations Iraq-\r\nKuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) in carrying out its\r\ntasks and has extended every possible assistance to the\r\nMission with the aim of enabling it to perform its duties.\r\nIraq has affirmed its adherence to the 1925 Geneva\r\nProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of\r\nAsphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases and Bacteriological\r\nMethods of warfare, and deposited the instruments of\r\nratification of the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Development, Production and Stockpiling of\r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\ntheir Destruction, in implementation of paragraph 7 of\r\nresolution 687 (1991).\r\nAs for the implementation by Iraq of section (C) of\r\nresolution 687 (1991), that is the provisions relating to\r\nproscribed weapons, our relationship with the Special\r\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) witnessed, in the middle of 1993, a turning point in\r\nthe field of positive and constructive cooperation in order\r\nto finalize the implementation of the said section.\r\nOn 26 November 1993, we presented the official\r\nresponse in regard to compliance with resolution 715 (1991)\r\nrelating to monitoring in the field of weapons.\r\nIn the process of work with the Special Commission\r\nand the IAEA, we have not hesitated to offer all possible\r\nassistance to facilitate the work, whether by presenting\r\ninformation, available documents, details relating to past\r\nprogrammes, the destruction of prohibited weapons, and\r\nthe setting up of an effective monitoring system. We have\r\nbeen able to achieve substantive progress in this area, as\r\nacknowledged by the Special Commission in its report to\r\nthe Security Council on 19 June 1995, and have taken the\r\nfinal steps to complete the desired work.\r\nThese facts are well established in the relationship\r\nbetween Iraq and the Special Commission and the IAEA.\r\nThe substantive nature of these facts cannot be distorted\r\nby the campaign waged against Iraq by well-known\r\nquarters because of special objectives of their own which\r\nare totally alien to the objectives of resolution 687 (1991).\r\nDespite all the propaganda, Iraq no longer has any\r\nproscribed weapons, equipment, devices or materials, and\r\nthis is the essence of resolution 687 (1991). We affirm\r\nour determination to continue our cooperation with the\r\nSpecial Commission and the IAEA to close the weapons\r\nfile in accordance with the relevant resolutions and have\r\nthe embargo against Iraq lifted.\r\nI should like to express here our deep regret\r\nregarding the a priori ill-intentioned exaggerations which\r\ncast a terrifying image of past Iraqi weapons programmes,\r\nand the deliberate distortion of the fact that these\r\nprogrammes were something of the past and that they no\r\nlonger exist. Raising fears in such a contrived fashion is\r\nnot an objective position at all. It is an attitude prompted\r\nby political objectives which are far removed from the\r\nconcern over security and stability in the region and the\r\nprovisions of resolution 687 (1991).\r\nIraq has taken all these steps even while it has\r\ncontinued to suffer the hardship caused by a total\r\nembargo, the most extended ever imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil in all its history. It is an embargo that embraces\r\neverything and every aspect of life with the exception of\r\nfood and medicine. However, the freezing of Iraq’s assets\r\nwith foreign banks has prevented Iraq from using any of\r\nthose assets to purchase its needs of medicines and\r\nfoodstuffs and, thereby, has made the exception relating\r\nto food and medicine devoid of any practical content. The\r\nsituation in Iraq has been aggravated by the actual\r\npractice obtaining in the work of the Security Council\r\nCommittee established by resolution 661 (1990), which is\r\nin charge of the application of sanctions against Iraq.\r\nWork in the Committee proceeds along highly\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nbureaucratic lines and follows the rule of unanimity. This\r\nhas provided certain States with an easy way to object and\r\nthereby to reject a large number of export requests to Iraq\r\nto meet civilian humanitarian needs, from pencils and\r\neducational materials to automobile tyres and other simple\r\ncivilian provisions. All these matters are documented in the\r\nrecords of the 661 Committee.\r\nThe deliberate insistence on prolonging the embargo\r\nagainst Iraq is not linked to Iraq’s implementation of its\r\nobligations. It is a systematic plan to inflict severe damage\r\nupon Iraq and to deliberately destroy its infrastructure and\r\nput paid to its developmental capabilities. This is a fact that\r\nis known to all. The reports of the competent United\r\nNations Agencies operating in Iraq and of\r\nnon-governmental organizations concerned with relief\r\nwarned against the deterioration of the situation as a result\r\nof the shortage of food and medicine, which threatens the\r\nlives of millions of Iraqis, including thousands of children,\r\nwomen and old people. In this connection, I should like to\r\nrefer to the last alert of the World Food Programme, issued\r\non 26 September 1995.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization, and his “Supplement to An Agenda for\r\nPeace”, refer clearly to the problem of sanctions. We\r\nshould like in turn to draw the attention of Member States\r\nto the fact that the application of sanctions against Iraq,\r\nwith such cruelty and bureaucratic complexity, calls for\r\nquestioning and scrutiny, in the interests of objectivity. We\r\nare not sure that all the representatives in the General\r\nAssembly know that the Security Council reviews the\r\nsanctions regime against Iraq every 60 days, and that 27\r\nreviews have been conducted to date without any easing of\r\nthe sanctions. The situation remains the same as it has been\r\nsince 3 April 1991, as if nothing had been achieved. Is this\r\na healthy situation?\r\nThe tragic consequences of the embargo have not been\r\nlimited to the food and health sectors in Iraq. The sections\r\nof agriculture, education and environment also have\r\nsustained grave damage, due to the shortages of materials\r\nand the basic requirements needed for work in such sectors,\r\neven at the minimum level required to satisfy the basic\r\nneeds of the civilian population.\r\nThe aggravation of this extremely difficult situation\r\nhas not prevented us from continuing to implement our\r\nobligations under the relevant resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil. It is worth noting that, as is known to all, while\r\nwe were being called upon to implement our obligations,\r\nand while we were deploying persistent efforts to do just\r\nthat, we have not received in return any objective and\r\nequitable position that would have reduced sanctions\r\ncommensurately with the progress achieved by Iraq in\r\nimplementing the resolutions, or that would have given\r\nencouragement and hope and given confidence that the\r\nsituation would be normalized eventually, in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe reality has been the very opposite. From the\r\nvery beginning and to date, we have been the target of\r\nmany threats; doubts have been raised about our\r\nintentions; and we have been, twice, the target of armed\r\naggression. There has been considerable deceit with\r\nregard to objectives. Pressure has been brought to bear on\r\nany party that even thought of treating us fairly, even if\r\nsuch fairness was not intended as a gesture towards Iraq\r\nbut as a means of safeguarding the credibility of the\r\nCharter system and of the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil. We have been accused of intermittent and\r\nselective cooperation and of a lack of peaceful intentions\r\nand lack of credibility, to such an extent that the levelling\r\nof accusations by certain parties has come to resemble a\r\nchronic pathological alignment. Such accusations have\r\nbeen accompanied by the continued pursuance on the\r\npractical level of policies aimed at interfering in the\r\ninternal affairs of Iraq in order to destabilize it; to\r\nundermine its security, stability, the freedom of its people\r\nand its sovereignty; and to try and change its political\r\nsystem.\r\nA super-Power has imposed upon my country two\r\nno-fly zones, in the north and the south, without any legal\r\njustification or authorization from the Security Council. It\r\nhas also exercised every means of pressure and deception\r\nto perpetuate the harsh conditions caused by the embargo\r\nagainst Iraq, while, at the same time, it conspires, quite\r\nopenly, to change the regime. Without any hesitation, its\r\nofficials declare that such is its intention. While all this\r\ntakes place, it is we who are asked to prove our peaceful\r\nintentions and credibility.\r\nIt is no secret that the Power that leads the onslaught\r\nI have spoken of against Iraq is the United States of\r\nAmerica. All the facts on the ground make it clear that it\r\nis the United States of America and no one else that\r\nshould be asked to demonstrate its credibility, to prove\r\nthat its intentions are peaceful, and to desist from its\r\ncontinuing acts of provocation, aggression and\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Iraq and from\r\nfomenting tension in the Gulf region under the pretext of\r\nan illusory threat.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nPresident Saddam Hussein noted that the American\r\nadministration’s accusation that Iraq lacks credibility in its\r\nrelationship with the Special Commission is a false one,\r\nand that it is the United States that does not have credibility\r\nin dealing with States and international organizations.\r\nWhere is the credibility in the position of the United States\r\nwhen it declares its determination not to lift the sanctions\r\nagainst Iraq even if Iraq implements Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991), of which the United States was the\r\nchief author? Again, where is the credibility in the position\r\nof the United States when the American administration\r\nmasses its naval and military forces in the Gulf and in the\r\nMediterranean under the false pretext that Iraq is planning\r\nto attack Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia?\r\nI do not wish to enter into polemics with the\r\nrepresentatives of the United States in the General\r\nAssembly. But I find it necessary, with regard to the\r\nAmerican allegations about credibility, to raise certain\r\npoints of principle which call for serious thought and\r\ncontemplation. Before I do that, I should like to ask this\r\nquestion: if it is important that the implementation of the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council should be founded on\r\ncredibility, then how can allegations about the credibility of\r\nIraq be accepted at a time when the State which repeats\r\nthose allegations puts itself above the Security Council and\r\nabove the Charter and gives itself the right to interpret\r\nUnited Nations resolutions and to arbitrarily draw\r\nconclusions from such interpretations that agree with its\r\nown selfish interests which are far removed from any basis\r\nto be found in the provisions of the resolutions themselves?\r\nWhile on the subject of credibility, where are the\r\nefforts of the Security Council, and the United States in\r\nparticular, with regard to the implementation of paragraph\r\n14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), which aims\r\nat declaring the Middle East as a zone free from weapons\r\nof mass destruction? This is an objective that has to be a\r\nfundamental cornerstone of the edifice of peace, security\r\nand stability in the region if such an edifice is to be built\r\non sturdy, well-balanced and equitable foundations. It is an\r\nobjective that acquires great importance from the standpoint\r\nof the oft-mentioned credibility, since it is a known fact\r\nthat Israel possesses those weapons. Why does the United\r\nStates keep completely silent about paragraph 14, and why\r\nhas the Security Council not taken any action towards the\r\nimplementation of that part of its resolution? Does such a\r\nblatant double standard have anything to do with\r\ncredibility?\r\nIs it objective or even fair to imagine that the\r\nobligations stipulated in Security Council resolutions could\r\nbe implemented in a natural fashion in the context of such\r\ncircumstances, atmospherics, and hostile policies directed\r\nagainst Iraq?\r\nIraq is well aware of the fact that it is not in its\r\ninterest to conceal any information relating to past\r\nweapons programmes, and that its interest lies in working\r\nto lift as soon as possible the sanctions that are imposed\r\non it. Indeed, Iraq is acting in full conformity with this\r\nobjective. In this connection, we call upon member States\r\nof the Security Council not to jump to any conclusions on\r\nthe basis of any unjust accusations levelled at Iraq,\r\nbecause the right thing to do would be to wait for the\r\noutcome of the work of the Special Commission, which\r\nis responsible for evaluating the implementation by Iraq\r\nof the Council’s resolutions concerning the proscribed\r\nweapons.\r\nWe do not call for anything more than the legally\r\nsound application of Security Council resolutions in\r\nconsonance with the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter, and not in line with the whims and aims of\r\nunilateral policies of a certain State, which are founded\r\non the logic of naked power, opportunism, double\r\nstandards and the imposition of hegemony.\r\nWe believe that there is a collective duty to work\r\njointly with firmness in order to put things in the right\r\nperspective in order to ensure the sound application of the\r\nprovisions of the Charter. The first step in this direction\r\nrequires us to ponder the philosophy of the sanctions as\r\ncreated by the Charter. Is the sanctions regime a means\r\ntowards an end, or is it an end in itself? What is the\r\nnature of the said regime? Is it punitive, or is it a means\r\nwhereby the purposes of the Charter should be achieved\r\nwithout reference to the individual policies of individual\r\nMember States?\r\nIt is well known to all that the sanctions regime\r\ncreated by the Charter is nothing more than a means\r\naimed at achieving certain results which would ultimately\r\nlead to the realization of the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations as elaborated in Articles 1 and 2 of\r\nthe Charter, and that the means should cease to be applied\r\nonce the end has been achieved.\r\nThe competence of the Security Council to impose\r\nsanctions is an exceptional means that is used when it is\r\nestablished, objectively, that all other means of peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes have failed. Such a means should\r\nnot be, however, a tool in the hands of a super-Power or\r\nof a group of major Powers to achieve foreign policy\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\ngoals at the expense of the common interest of Member\r\nStates.\r\nIt is now patently clear that the imposition of sanctions\r\non Iraq and the maintenance of the embargo against it, in\r\nthe well-known fashion, cannot be justified on the\r\nsubstantive basis of the provisions of the Charter, because\r\nit has become, in actual fact, an extension of the unilateral\r\npolicy of a super-Power that has made sanctions an end in\r\nthemselves and a vindictive means that serves its own\r\ninterests in the region.\r\nIn essence, the grounds for the imposition of sanctions\r\non Iraq no longer exist and, thus, the sanctions should be\r\nlifted. But a well-known State obstructs the process.\r\nWe should like to say to the United States that the\r\nsolution lies in dialogue, which provides a mechanism for\r\nthe achievement of interests on a balanced and equitable\r\nbasis. This is what Iraq has called for and continues to call\r\nfor. The policy of hegemony and of creating crises cannot\r\nbut fail, because it is illegitimate and because the\r\ninternational community rejects it. While this continues to\r\nbe our position of principle, we unfortunately find that the\r\nUnited States statesmen ignore the realities of the region\r\nand the needs and aspirations of its peoples, who yearn to\r\nlive in stability, peace and fruitful cooperation amongst\r\nthemselves and with the world as a whole.\r\nAt a time when we witness the tensions and internal\r\nconflicts that prevail in the states of the region, and the\r\nfeelings of bitterness amongst their peoples as a result of\r\nthe current short-sighted policies, which recall to mind the\r\npolicies of the old imperialist Powers, we in Iraq should\r\nlike, from this rostrum, to call for the promotion of\r\nrelations of dialogue, understanding and good\r\nneighbourliness amongst the States of the region, on the\r\nbasis of mutual respect, in accordance with the principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIraq is an ancient country with a very long history that\r\ngoes back 7,000 years. The Iraqi people, who have\r\ncontributed greatly to human civilization, will remain in\r\ncontrol of their affairs, independent in their choices and\r\ncapable of overcoming crises.\r\nWe hope that Member States, especially the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, will make every effort to\r\ninterpret and apply the provisions of the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council in accordance with their normal legal\r\nmeaning and not on the basis of whims and the political\r\ninterests of this or that State. Any course of action that\r\ndeviates from this principled rule would lead only to loss\r\nof credibility and utterly undermine the principle of good\r\nfaith in the determination of international obligations.\r\nThe United Nations was established in order to\r\nachieve the common goals of preserving peace, security\r\nand stability in the world. The provisions of the\r\nOrganization’s Charter, in letter and in spirit, are founded\r\non the balancing of rights and duties and aim at\r\nprotecting the common interests of the international\r\ncommunity. Therefore policies that are based on the logic\r\nof naked power and unilateral action outside the concepts\r\nof the Charter, and that aim at achieving individual\r\nobjectives, are bound to contradict the very raison d’être\r\nof the Organization and to contravene the letter and spirit\r\nof its Charter. Such policies would only lead to the\r\nmarginalization of the Organization’s role in international\r\naffairs.\r\nIt behoves us as we are about to celebrate half a\r\ncentury of the existence of the Organization to rededicate\r\nourselves to honouring our undertakings as enshrined in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLatvia, His Excellency Mr. Valdis Birkavs, on whom I\r\ncall.\r\nMr. Birkavs (Latvia): Allow me to congratulate\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election as President\r\nof the General Assembly. I wish all of us a productive\r\nand fruitful session.\r\nI also wish to thank His Excellency Mr. Amara\r\nEssy, President of the Assembly at its forty-ninth session,\r\nfor his able leadership, and to give due recognition to the\r\nSecretary-General for his achievements in restructuring\r\nthe United Nations on the eve of its golden\r\nanniversary — an occasion for remembrance and\r\ncelebration, but also a time for reflection and appraisal.\r\nThe Baltic States have participated in the work of\r\nthe United Nations only since 1991. Nevertheless, during\r\nthe long years of occupation the United Nations was\r\nperceived in Latvia as a unique global international\r\nOrganization embodying humanity’s ideas about freedom,\r\nhuman rights, sovereign equality and respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nI shall not join in detracting and criticizing the\r\nUnited Nations, for it is not an entity existing on its own.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nRather, the effectiveness of the Organization is a function\r\nof the political will of its Member States and their resolve\r\nto find common ground. In criticizing the United Nations,\r\nwe should keep in mind the amount of criticism that must\r\nbe directed against ourselves.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the end of the cold war has put\r\nan end to balance-of-power politics. Still, the situation in\r\nthe world today evokes historical analogies — about\r\ncollective security, aggressors and their appeasement. A\r\ngeneration of Latvians still alive remembers the results of\r\nappeasement in 1939. It is often stated that today’s leaders\r\nmust try not to repeat the mistakes of the past. The notion\r\nthat they have succeeded is belied by the recent\r\nestablishment of international ad hoc tribunals regarding the\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and by the\r\npressing need for an international criminal court.\r\nConflict-prevention mechanisms, including preventive\r\ndiplomacy and preventive deployment, as well as other\r\nconfidence-building measures, have become increasingly\r\nimportant. The establishment of political dialogue between\r\nparties and early action by the international community are\r\na key to heading off potential conflicts.\r\nThe status of the United Nations as a centre for\r\nconflict resolution may be enhanced by promoting the\r\nuniversality of the Organization. We support the statement\r\nof the Secretary-General that the process of arms control\r\nand disarmament needs to be globalized and that it is vital\r\nthat all States be engaged in the disarmament process in\r\npractice as well as in declared intent. Latvia supported the\r\nunconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We hope that\r\nanother historic step will be taken next year with the\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.\r\nThe dramatic rise in the number and complexity of\r\npeace-keeping operations in recent years, as well as the\r\ndistinctive nature and experience of each operation, requires\r\nnew approaches to peace-keeping. Humanitarian assistance,\r\nhuman rights and economic and political questions are now\r\nintegral components of peace-keeping. Experience shows\r\nthat it is necessary to detach peace-keeping from\r\nenforcement action. In Somalia, as well as in the territory\r\nof the former Yugoslavia, peace-keepers have been\r\nperceived as enemies. In such cases the most suitable\r\nsolution is for the United Nations to grant clearly defined\r\nauthority to international organizations or groups of States\r\nthat have the desire and the capacity to establish peace.\r\nRecognizing that each State has a duty to contribute\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nLatvia is ready to participate, within the Danish battalion,\r\nin bringing peace to the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia. For the purposes of peace-keeping, the Baltic\r\nStates have established a Baltic battalion (BALTBAT),\r\nwhich is currently undergoing intensive training in\r\npreparation for a future role in peace-keeping missions. I\r\ntake this opportunity to thank all countries that have\r\nsupported the establishment and training of BALTBAT —\r\nin particular, the United States, the Nordic countries, the\r\nUnited Kingdom and Germany.\r\nLatvia strongly supports efforts to strengthen and\r\nreform the United Nations system so that it may better\r\nserve the peoples of the Earth. It recognizes that it is still\r\ntoo early to clearly perceive the shape of the post-cold-\r\nwar world, which must be the final determinant of the\r\nnature of the necessary reforms.\r\nIn these circumstances there is a need to view\r\nreforms of the United Nations system as a long-term,\r\nongoing process that must protect the stability of the\r\nUnited Nations system at all times. At the same time,\r\nthere is an opportunity for progress in regard to reforms\r\nwhich can be made without making permanent\r\ncommitments to new fundamental system structures and\r\nprocedures.\r\nIn the light of these general considerations, I should\r\nnow like to address Security Council reforms and United\r\nNations system financing issues.\r\nThe operation of the Security Council must continue\r\nto become more transparent and open, while preserving\r\nthe Council’s effectiveness. Its expansion must strengthen\r\nthe role played by small countries in global\r\ndecision-making, while respecting equitable geographic\r\ndistribution and the new geopolitical realities of the\r\npost-cold-war era.\r\nSince there is general agreement about the need for\r\na modest expansion of the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly could immediately decide to carry it out, if the\r\ndecision would not force Member States to make\r\npermanent commitments on the two controversial\r\nissues — the composition of the Council and the use of\r\nthe veto. Latvia intends to make proposals in this regard\r\nto the relevant Working Group of the General Assembly.\r\nThe current system of financing the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations depends largely on assessed and voluntary\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\ncontributions of Member States. The unprecedented\r\ndifficulties of financing the recent growth in international\r\nactivities have exposed the limitations of the current\r\nsystem, in which international activities have to compete for\r\nfunds against national activities that have stronger\r\nconstituencies.\r\nA recent report, commissioned by the Independent\r\nCommission for Population and Quality of Life, on\r\ninnovative financing mechanisms for internationally agreed\r\nprogrammes, has made a number of recommendations to\r\nstudy and compile information relevant to such\r\nmechanisms. Latvia would support a decision by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this fiftieth session to prepare a\r\ncompilation of information relevant to, and appropriate\r\nstudies of, innovative financing mechanisms.\r\nInnovative financing mechanisms are a matter for the\r\nfuture. Even then, they should not supplant the current\r\nsystem, which, however, needs to be improved.\r\nGovernments have a long-range interest in strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations by completing the reform of the current,\r\nhighly inequitable scale of assessments for the regular\r\nbudget. The reformed scale must obey the equitable\r\nprinciple that Member States with equal average per capita\r\nincomes should bear assessments that are broadly at the\r\nsame per capita level.\r\nThe current inequitable scale is one cause of the\r\ncurrent financial crisis of the United Nations, in that the\r\nover-assessed States are responsible for relatively high\r\namounts of outstanding contributions, including arrears\r\nfrom preceding years.\r\nThis observation is illustrated by the case of the 15\r\nMember States, including Latvia, that were over-assessed\r\nby a General Assembly decision, adopted by vote, in 1992.\r\nA second decision in 1994 improved the situation\r\nsomewhat, by initiating a gradual decline in the excessive\r\nassessment, which in 1997 will still be two times higher\r\nthan the assessment based on the principle of capacity-\r\nto-pay.\r\nWhile Latvia recognizes and tries to discharge its\r\nobligation, derived from the principle of sovereign equality,\r\nto pay in full and on time, it also believes that a second\r\ncomponent of the principle of sovereign equality — the\r\nequal rights of all Member States — is not respected by the\r\npresent assessment. The resulting over-assessment is a\r\nreason that has led, in spite of Latvia’s best efforts under\r\ndifficult financial conditions and in the face of many\r\npressing social, economic and humanitarian needs, to a\r\nbuild-up of arrears which now threaten the application of\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter, beginning January 1996. It will\r\nforce Latvia to seek relief from the General Assembly.\r\nIn discussing the work of the United Nations in the\r\neconomic and social sphere, it is useful to do so from the\r\nperspective of the individual. Is he or she secure? Has he\r\nor she enough food? Does he or she have adequate living\r\nconditions and opportunities for developing his or her\r\npotential?\r\nIn the world today, enormous differences in levels of\r\ndevelopment persist among countries. The United Nations\r\nhas accomplished a great deal in its work to eradicate\r\npoverty and disease and to provide humanitarian relief. It\r\nwould be possible to further improve this work by\r\nimproving coordination between relief agencies and\r\nprogrammes and by eliminating redundancies. Relief must\r\naddress needs; the United Nations has a significant role to\r\nplay in needs assessment.\r\nIn the past Member States of the United Nations\r\nhave met in a number of global forums to highlight the\r\nissues surrounding people-centred development. World\r\nconferences in Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen\r\nand, most recently, Beijing have drafted platforms for\r\naction. Such large gatherings are sometimes criticized as\r\nbeing expensive and resulting in few tangible outputs.\r\nSuch criticism could be avoided if Member States were\r\nto implement their commitments fully. However\r\nimplementation is greatly constrained by the financial\r\nrealities of each State.\r\nNevertheless, Latvia has implemented a\r\nrecommendation of the 1993 World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights by establishing a national Human Rights\r\nOffice, which commenced operations earlier this year.\r\nThe Latvian Human Rights Office is an independent\r\ninstitution for the protection and promotion of human\r\nrights.\r\nThe international community has agreed that human\r\nrights are inviolable and are the cornerstone of democratic\r\nsocieties. We intend to continue to implement the\r\nrecommendations of the Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action, and urge other States to do the\r\nsame. Further, we believe that the question of the\r\nadequate financing of the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights must be resolved.\r\nThe environment is an area that, along with human\r\nrights, demands Latvia’s attention during the present\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nperiod of remedying the many consequences of Latvia’s\r\noccupation. In this connection, Latvia is making efforts to\r\nhold an international conference on disarmament and its\r\nrelationship to environment and development.\r\nLatvia’s development, particularly in the social sector,\r\nhas been greatly assisted by the work of the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\r\nestablished in Riga in 1992. The Government of Latvia\r\nfully cooperates with and supports the work of UNDP, and\r\nis ready to increase the level of this cooperation.\r\nLatvia attaches high priority to the economic and\r\nsocial work of the United Nations and understands the\r\nobligation of each Member State to contribute to this work.\r\nWe value and support the efforts to reform the Economic\r\nand Social Council and, in the spirit of sustaining and\r\nfurthering its work, have presented our candidature for\r\nmembership in the Economic and Social Council for the\r\nperiod 1997-1999.\r\nIn pondering the future of the United Nations during\r\nits fiftieth anniversary, allow me to quote Mr. Henry Cabot\r\nLodge, Jr., a former United States representative to the\r\nUnited Nations:\r\n“This Organization is created to prevent you from\r\ngoing to hell. It isn’t created to take you to heaven.”\r\nLet us remember these words as we look to the future of\r\nthe United Nations. Let us make the necessary changes to\r\nour Organization and, moreover, concentrate our political\r\nwill so that we may ensure that humanity will always\r\nremain firmly anchored between heaven and hell, on the\r\nplanet Earth.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Chairman of the delegation of Malawi,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. David Rubadiri.\r\nMr. Rubadiri (Malawi): Allow me to congratulate the\r\nPresident on his election to his high office at the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The Government and the\r\npeople of the Republic of Malawi hold him and his great\r\ncountry, Portugal, in high esteem. His appointment to\r\npreside over the deliberations of the Assembly during this\r\nimportant session, as the United Nations commemorates its\r\nfiftieth anniversary, is an indisputable reflection of the\r\nrecognition of his eminence by the international community.\r\nMy delegation is confident that he will guide the\r\ndeliberations of the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion.\r\nAt the same time, allow me to pay tribute to his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, who, in spite of the complexity of the issues and\r\nthe difficult constraints which confronted the United\r\nNations during his tenure, guided the work of the\r\nforty-ninth session with admirable skill, dignity and\r\nvision.\r\nIt is indeed very difficult to have to speak today\r\nafter His Holiness the Pope, lest those words which this\r\nmorning flew up to high rafters of this building be\r\nforgotten. We in Malawi feel that perhaps it was our fate\r\nto be scheduled to speak after him. The Assembly will\r\nrecall that the Pope talked about the moral aspects of\r\nnationhood, politics and relations between nations. The\r\nAssembly will also remember how he gave the word\r\nfreedom a new dimension and meaning, saying that man\r\nwill insist on it, whether small or big. The Assembly will\r\nalso remember the moral responsibility he put upon the\r\nhuman being, both as an individual and as a member of\r\nthe community of what is really a small planet. One need\r\nonly fly a few miles up in the air from this little planet,\r\nwhich we call Earth, to see that we all really look like\r\nlittle rabbits dashing from one foxhole to another.\r\nHowever, as human beings, we also resemble God, our\r\ncreator. To me it seemed as if our call to speak after him,\r\nthis afternoon, was an occasion to try to strengthen what\r\nHis Holiness the Pope left with us this morning.\r\nThe twentieth century is soon coming to an end.\r\nHistorians will remember and record it as the century of\r\nthree great phenomena, I think. The first was the\r\nestablishment of a power structure, as demonstrated by\r\nthe rise of the great experiments: the experiment in\r\ndemocracy built on capitalism and respect for individual\r\nrights and the experiment in socialism based on a social\r\ncontract for a community with a common purpose. The\r\nconflict of these ideas would lead to the emergence of\r\nwhat would dominate the world’s political ways during\r\nthe first 45 years of this Organization’s existence: the\r\ncold war.\r\nThe second great phenomenon that the Pope referred\r\nto was the fall of the empires built by the European\r\nPowers from Asia to Africa and the proud rise of\r\ncolonized people to independence. The third — and\r\nperhaps the most heart-rending — phenomenon of this\r\ncentury was that of racism. We saw it first in South\r\nAfrica and later began to see it rearing its ugly head in\r\nthe twilight of this century.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nThe curtain of this act finally falls on the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. Let us remember the joy\r\nand ecstasy with which the former colonial countries\r\nemerged into independence as Members of this body. What\r\ngenius woke up to think of and, later, to found this\r\nOrganization? What idealism sustained it? Yet a dark\r\nshadow haunted it in its growth; and now, as the\r\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary is upon us, we\r\nsomehow realize that perhaps the cold war, that Iron\r\nCurtain, was used by the great Powers, in the name of\r\ndemocracy, human rights and justice for all, simply to keep\r\na balance of power.\r\nMalawi does not wish to seem bitter in expressing\r\nsome of these thoughts; but 50, even in a mere human life,\r\nis the age at which soul-searching is important. Along with\r\nmany others, Malawi sowed the seeds of its own gorgon 30\r\nyears ago — what the Pope referred to as the totalitarian\r\ntotem. The pattern of Presidents-for-life and one-party\r\nautocracies bred a series of dictatorships supported by the\r\ninterests of the cold war’s great Powers.\r\nWhen perestroika knocked on the door, man heaved\r\na sigh of relief. The cold war had ended. We in Malawi\r\nwere not left behind. A new dawn broke in the land once\r\ndescribed by Africa Watch as a place where silence rules.\r\nLast year Malawi stood up in this Assembly to declare\r\nproudly that a people cannot be kept down for ever by\r\nman’s inhumanity to man. Thanks to the action of the\r\nUnited Nations, Malawi fought, this time not for\r\nindependence, but for democracy. A referendum in 1993\r\nand a general election, supervised by this world body and\r\nother friends, on 17 May 1994, gave birth to a new country.\r\nThis is what the Pope referred to as “hope”.\r\nToday, a year and five months later, the four estates\r\nof democracy are taking root in Malawi. We now have an\r\nelective executive and a pluralist parliament with one of the\r\nmost active and articulate oppositions slowly learning the\r\ncomplex art of debate and the art of give-and-take. In\r\naddition, we also have an independent judiciary protecting\r\nthe bastion of the rule of law from which all human rights\r\nare protected and nurtured and we have an independent and\r\nfree press.\r\nThese four estates are almost a novelty in Malawi\r\nafter 30 years of autocracy and a dictatorship responsible\r\nfor the most vicious abuse of human life. Above all, it is\r\nimportant to remember that pathological hero worship is the\r\nprice people pay for losing their self-respect. There is\r\ntherefore cause to celebrate the 50 years of the life of the\r\nUnited Nations — especially for Malawi for, from the\r\nland of the dead, we have come back to the land of the\r\nliving.\r\nWe are astonished, however, that at this moment of\r\nrebirth Malawi — and possibly other countries — seem\r\nto have been abandoned. Could this be what the Pope was\r\ntalking about — the small nations — those which have\r\npower, whether it be economic or military? Where are\r\nthose great friends of yesteryear, the great friends of the\r\ndays of the cold war? We are astonished that as we are\r\nrejoicing in our new democracy they are now standing\r\naloof watching our skeletons of hitherto silenced and\r\nabused citizenry feeding the flickering fires of democracy\r\nagainst the howling winds of poverty, hunger and disease.\r\nIn this wider breakthrough of understanding in the\r\nuniverse, let us be thankful that on this tiny planet there\r\nis on the East River in New York a piece of land where\r\npeople meet to discuss problems — some no bigger than\r\nan ant-hill and some larger — thankful that somewhere\r\nthere is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu where\r\nlilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes!\r\nAfter 30 Years of educated leadership we are still\r\none of the least developed countries in the world, highest\r\nin the rate of illiteracy and the most highly indebted, but\r\nthe most beautiful in nature and the one best qualified,\r\nperhaps, for a Marshall Plan.\r\nMalawi is among those countries in the world that\r\nhave a high incidence of the HIV/AIDS infection. This\r\npandemic has seriously affected the young and active\r\nsegment of the population, which is the hub of\r\ndevelopment activity in all sectors of the national\r\neconomy. We commend the untiring efforts of the World\r\nHealth Organization and other institutions which, together\r\nwith my Government, are actively engaged in tackling\r\nthis pandemic.\r\nBut perhaps I might add that, above all, the\r\nConference on Women held in Beijing brought to the\r\nfore, at least for us, the entire issue of trying to\r\nunderstand the whole question of man’s responsibility\r\ntowards man and the importance of the idea of hope and\r\nsustenance in recognizing the role of women, for in my\r\ncountry 70 per cent of the economy and 70 per cent of\r\nhuman love and care and 70 per cent of all that makes a\r\nnation admirable is in the hands of women.\r\nHow can one understand those who caused so many\r\nbombs and mines to be planted in Mozambique and\r\nAngola? How do they think of the women and children\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nwho wake up with new hope and who go to fetch water or\r\nplant their plantations and who find themselves blown up\r\nby those who should have cared much more than to play\r\nwith such weapons — such utterly senseless weapons of\r\ndestruction?\r\nUntil recently my country hosted a large number of\r\nrefugees from Mozambique when that country was\r\nexperiencing civil strife. The size of the refugee\r\ncommunity, which peaked at over a million, has now\r\ndecreased as refugees are returning home since the\r\nconclusion of a peace accord between the then warring\r\nFRELIMO government and the forces of RENAMO.\r\nHowever, despite the ongoing repatriation of the\r\nrefugees back to Mozambique, a strong legacy of\r\nenvironmental degradation is left behind. Deforestation,\r\novergrazing, and the destruction of roads used by relief\r\nsupply vehicles are some of the problems which resulted\r\nfrom the presence of the refugees.\r\nIn addition, Malawi is playing host to a number of\r\nrefugee communities from around Africa — from Rwanda\r\nand Somalia — although their numbers have grown\r\nnowhere near those reached by our brothers and sisters\r\nfrom neighbouring Mozambique.\r\nThe Government of Malawi would like at this juncture\r\nto express its most sincere gratitude and appreciation for\r\nthe kind and invaluable assistance received from the United\r\nNations system, particularly through the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), as well as from donor Governments and\r\nagencies, and non-governmental organizations at a time\r\nwhen we most needed help.\r\nSince the region experienced severe drought in the\r\n1992 and 1993 crop seasons, with a mild recovery in 1993\r\nand 1994, rainfall has continued to be erratic in southern\r\nAfrica. The economy of Malawi, which is almost entirely\r\nagro-based, has been hard-hit, resulting in chronic food\r\nshortages. This season has not been any better. Once again,\r\nthe country faces severe food shortages, which the\r\nGovernment has to meet through importing grain, mainly\r\nmaize. Is this a test of our democracy? Can a democracy,\r\neven a classical Grecian one, grow on an empty stomach?\r\nAgainst this background is the programme for the\r\nalleviation of poverty, which the new Government of\r\nMalawi has enunciated in order to tackle the chronic\r\npoverty which it inherited from the previous regime. The\r\npoverty-alleviation programme seeks to target the rural\r\npoor, who are in the majority as the primary beneficiary.\r\nA poverty-alleviation fund has been set up, along with a\r\nMalawi social action fund, which is a component thereof.\r\nThe programme is multisectoral in approach and aims at\r\npromoting the education and health sectors among others.\r\nThe Government has, in this regard, introduced free\r\nprimary school education and has also tried to increase\r\nthe number of schools.\r\nMy Government would therefore like to thank the\r\nUnited Nations system and the donor community and the\r\nmany other institutions in the private sector — especially\r\nthe missionary sector — which have extended assistance\r\nin our development endeavours, for if our courage and\r\nhope had not been evoked by the Catholic bishops of\r\nMalawi I would not be speaking here today. I am a\r\nproduct of the 30 years of exile which totalitarianism\r\nimposed on my country.\r\nThe success of the poverty alleviation programme\r\ntherefore becomes a major aspect of our hopes and\r\nexpectations. The new culture of tolerance has created a\r\nhighly conducive climate for investment. We have\r\ntherefore opened the door to prospective investors to\r\ncome, explore and take advantage of the opportunities\r\nwhich exist in other areas such as tourism, irrigation,\r\nmining and other sectors of the economy.\r\nMalawi has noted with interest the ongoing efforts\r\nto reform the United Nations system. We have observed\r\nin particular the various proposals that have been put\r\nforward on the reform of the Security Council. The\r\nSecurity Council is, truly, an important organ of the\r\nOrganization. It is therefore proper and fitting that an\r\norgan of such high standing should operate in an\r\naccountable and transparent manner. In addition, Malawi\r\nsupports measures aimed at enhancing equitable\r\nrepresentation in an effort to reflect the existing\r\ninternational political configuration as well as the\r\ncomposition of the United Nations.\r\nAs Malawi consolidates genuine freedom and\r\ndemocracy it is pleasing to note that the rest of the\r\nsouthern African region has unwaveringly embraced this\r\nnew culture of political pluralism and tolerance. More\r\nimportant, those countries which have for long been\r\ndevastated by civil strife have either resolved or are in the\r\nprocess of resolving their misunderstandings.\r\nMalawi welcomes encouraging moves towards the\r\ndemobilization of combatants of both the Angolan\r\nGovernment Forces and the National Union for the Total\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nIndependence of Angola (UNITA) under the third United\r\nNations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III). We\r\nfully commend the invaluable role which we, the United\r\nNations, are playing in Angola.\r\nIn South Africa, the post-apartheid Government of\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela is now firmly in place.\r\nIncidentally, I am glad I can pronounce it properly, for it is\r\nnot “apartheid” but “apart hate” — put apart and hate. The\r\ndemise of “apart hate” brightened prospects for peace and\r\ncooperation in southern Africa. Malawi therefore calls upon\r\nthe international community to render unflinching support\r\nto the new and emerging democracies in the region so that\r\nthey do not slide back to anarchy and authoritarianism.\r\nThe Malawi Government is concerned about the slow\r\npace at which the identification of eligible voters is\r\nproceeding in Western Sahara. We appreciate the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations to extend its Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) as a show of\r\ngenuine commitment to resolving this long-standing issue.\r\nIt should, however, be noted that without the commitment\r\nof the principal players in the matter the current efforts will\r\nall be in vain. We therefore call upon the Government of\r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco to allow the United Nations\r\nMission a free hand in its operations so that the deadline of\r\nJanuary 1996 for the holding of a referendum can be met.\r\nMalawi has noted with a good deal of concern the\r\nhorrendous massacres of innocent people in the Central\r\nAfrican country of Rwanda. However, despite the continued\r\nexistence of ethnic tensions, the efforts of the United\r\nNations to ensure that peace finally descends upon this\r\ntroubled area have not faltered. To this end, my\r\nGovernment earnestly commends the role played by the\r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),\r\nto which we have made a modest contribution of military\r\nobservers as a demonstration of Malawi’s commitment to\r\nthe restoration of peace.\r\nThe militarization of the refugee camps outside\r\nRwanda is a source of great concern to Malawi. We\r\ntherefore call upon the international community to do its\r\nutmost to reverse the reported inflow of weaponry into the\r\nrefugee camps, and appeal to the people of Rwanda to\r\nexercise political maturity in order to avoid a degeneration\r\nof the situation into the tragedy of yesteryear, especially\r\nwhen the mandate of UNAMIR expires on 9 December\r\n1995.\r\nMy Government is encouraged by the progress being\r\nmade in the Middle East peace process. We commend the\r\ncourage and determination of the Government of the State\r\nof Israel as well as the leadership of the Palestine\r\nNational Authority to move ahead. The two players\r\ndeserve the unflinching support and applause of the\r\ninternational community to ensure that elements which are\r\nopposed to the peace process do not succeed.\r\nOn the other hand, we have observed with remorse\r\nthe tragedy which has unfolded in the countries of the\r\nformer Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Innocent civilians\r\nhave been the most hurt in the shifting fortunes of war in\r\nthe Balkan region. Understandably, the United Nations\r\nand the rest of the international community can play only\r\na limited role in the resolution of the conflict. My\r\nGovernment, therefore, calls upon the principal players in\r\nthe region to cooperate with the international community\r\nin finding a lasting solution to the conflict.\r\nIt is the hope of my Government that the Korean\r\npeople on both sides of the thirty-eighth parallel will\r\nsustain and strengthen contact, with the aim of breaking\r\nthe existing impasse in the reunification of the divided\r\npeninsula.\r\nIn the same vein, my Government favours any\r\nefforts the United Nations may undertake with the aim of\r\nresolving the issue of the international status of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in a manner which would\r\nbe acceptable to both the Government of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China and the authorities in Taiwan.\r\nAs the United Nations celebrates 50 years of\r\nexistence, let us take full stock of the work of the\r\nOrganization since its birth. Let us retrace our steps and\r\nweigh our achievements and failures so that we may\r\napproach the twenty-first century with renewed vigour\r\nand commitment. Let us not lose sight of the ideals which\r\nthe Organization stands for as we continue to uphold the\r\nnecessary flexibility for its adaptation to current trends.\r\nLastly, to those who love and cherish democracy let\r\nthe word go out, lest we forget, that the name\r\n“Nyasaland” at one time represented the biblical David\r\nand Goliath in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,\r\nwhich, if it had been given birth, would have made the\r\nscript for that region a different story. When the borders\r\nthat defined our nationhood opened again and we became\r\npart of Mother Africa and the rest of the world, our State\r\nPresident, Bakili Muluzi, burst out of a suffocated\r\nMalawi, which had become a prison, and invited the\r\nworld to come and rejoice with us. The silent Malawians\r\nwho had crept out of Malawi, cautious not to speak to\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nothers about the pain of imprisonment and death in their\r\nprison country, now saw a new leadership, not only in\r\nPresident Muluzi, but in the people of the country\r\nthemselves. If these 15 months of the new Malawi have not\r\nmeant much to the World Bank, the fatigued donors and the\r\nsceptical theoreticians, let them remember the following\r\ngreat words of Pliny:\r\n“There is always something new out of Africa. Its\r\npresence on this continent, like the great seas that\r\nsurround it, are legendary. Ignore Africa to your\r\nperil.” (Pliny the Elder, Natural History, VII, 77)\r\nIn the same breath, we plead to you here again and\r\nagain: listen to what was said at the United Nations social\r\nsummit meeting, at the United Nations women’s summit\r\nmeeting and during the International Year of the Child.\r\nThere is no hope for mankind in the twenty-first century\r\nand after without a United Nations based on those three\r\ngreat occasions. Malawi pleads to those great nations that\r\nhave grown up with the ideals and ideas of human giants of\r\nthe world not to jump off the ship that carries us all. No\r\none can say, “Stop the world, I want to get off.”\r\nOn behalf of the people of Malawi, I thank Members\r\nof the General Assembly for their attention.\r\nMr. Oyono (Cameroon) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe delegation of Cameroon congratulates Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. We wish him well\r\nas he guides the work of this historic session, which\r\ncoincides with the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Organization. Knowing as I do\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral’s distinction as an educator and a\r\nstatesman, I welcome his election.\r\nMoreover, the President represents a friendly country,\r\nPortugal, whose involvement in Africa is of long standing\r\nand which shares with Cameroon a part of our history:\r\nWhen he alit on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea in 1472,\r\nthe Portuguese Fernando Po was much impressed with the\r\nabundance of shrimp in the waters off what is now the city\r\nof Douala and named the place “Rio dos Camarões” —\r\nShrimp River — from which Cameroon takes its name.\r\nWe also convey our appreciation to His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, for the way in which he carried out his\r\nresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session.\r\nFinally, we pledge to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our constant support in his\r\ntireless efforts to enable the Organization to attain its\r\nnoble purposes.\r\nIt is of enormous significance that the present\r\nsession of the General Assembly should coincide with the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization. The United\r\nNations, which sums up and expresses the deep-felt\r\naspiration of the peoples and nations of the world to\r\npeace, freedom and progress, has become an\r\nindispensable conclave of nations. The Organization’s\r\nuniversality makes it the ideal forum for governing the\r\nworld order.\r\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary should\r\ntherefore be a source of satisfaction to the entire\r\ninternational community. It provides an opportunity to\r\ngauge how far we have come since the beginning and to\r\nconsider our views on the future of the Organization.\r\nWhen they created the United Nations after the Second\r\nWorld War, the founders affirmed their determination to\r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nFortunately, for more than half a century the\r\nNorth — once the epicentre of most of history’s major\r\nconflicts — has been a place of peace and cooperation;\r\nand, despite the build-up of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nthe rivalry between the two great ideological and military\r\nalliances did not drag international society into a third\r\nworld war, which would have sealed the fate of mankind.\r\nAware of the danger to the world posed by the arms\r\nrace, the United Nations encouraged the conclusion of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\r\nits indefinite extension; it has promoted the creation of\r\ndenuclearized zones, inter alia in Africa, and the\r\nconclusion of the Convention on the prohibition of\r\nchemical weapons; and it has given decisive impetus to\r\nmultilateral negotiations on disarmament.\r\nWe are glad that, in its ongoing quest for peace, the\r\nOrganization has been able when necessary to adapt the\r\nCharter to the realities, including by devising the notion\r\nof peace-keeping operations, which have defused many\r\nconflicts and created favourable conditions for dialogue\r\nand negotiation.\r\nBy awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to United\r\nNations peace-keeping forces on 29 September 1988, the\r\nNobel prize committee paid tribute to the devotion and\r\ncourage of the more than half a million men and women\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nwho since 1948 have served the cause of peace all over the\r\nworld.\r\nEven if in recent years peace-keeping operations have\r\nhad mixed results and have been accused of consuming the\r\nlion’s share of United Nations resources to the detriment of\r\ndevelopment, it must be recognized that while the path has\r\nnot always been smooth, these operations have on the\r\nwhole yielded positive results. The “Agenda for Peace”,\r\nthen, remains relevant, and must continue to be the\r\nfoundation of United Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\nCameroon supports the recommendations of the\r\nWorking Group to strengthen these operations by defining\r\nin advance precise objectives, the timeframe for the\r\nintervention, and the resources needed for implementation.\r\nSimilarly, and as we have always said, the United Nations\r\nmust strengthen its cooperation with regional and\r\nsubregional organizations by making available the means\r\nnecessary to enable them to discharge their peace-keeping\r\nmandate. That is why we welcome cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity in\r\nthe area of prevention, management and settlement of\r\nconflicts on a continent riddled with crises and conflicts of\r\nmany forms and many dimensions.\r\nThis applies also on the subregional level: to the role\r\nin the area of peace-keeping of the Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which\r\ndeserves support, as the Committee, which was created with\r\nthe assistance of the Secretary-General, brings together\r\n11 Central African countries which have decided to set up\r\nwithin their national armed forces units specializing in\r\npeace-keeping operations to be carried out under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity. Cameroon trusts that the United Nations will\r\nshow greater interest in this available force of more than\r\n10,000 soldiers, which could serve as reserve forces for\r\npeace missions.\r\nAnother area where United Nations action has been\r\nparticularly significant is decolonization. Thanks to that\r\naction and to their own peoples’ emancipation struggles,\r\nmany colonial Territories have gained independence and\r\nsovereignty; today they make up more than half of the\r\nmembership of the Organization. More than any other\r\ncontinent, Africa is proud to have unswervingly promoted\r\nthe process of its own total liberation, which was recently\r\ncompleted with the end of apartheid in South Africa.\r\nHere we recall with gratitude that it was under United\r\nNations auspices that Cameroon attained sovereignty after\r\nhaving been first a German colony, then a Territory under\r\nLeague of Nations Mandate, then a United Nations Trust\r\nTerritory. It is our hope that the few Territories remaining\r\nunder foreign administration will freely exercise their\r\ninalienable right to self-determination, so that the United\r\nNations objective of the complete eradication of\r\ncolonialism by the year 2000 may be realized.\r\nAlso to the credit of the Organization are the\r\npromotion of human rights, the ongoing development and\r\ncodification of international law, and achievements in all\r\nthe areas covered by the specialized agencies.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights in\r\ngeneral and those of the most vulnerable and\r\ndisadvantaged in particular are at the centre of our\r\nconcerns and those of the United Nations. The creation of\r\nthe Centre for Human Rights, the convening at Vienna of\r\nthe World Conference on Human Rights and the\r\nappointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nall enable the United Nations to follow progress in the\r\narea of human rights throughout the world and to assert\r\ncertain principles by which States must abide. Cameroon\r\nwelcomes this, and attaches great importance to\r\nrecognition of and respect for all human rights, including\r\nthe right to development.\r\nAs regards humanitarian assistance, our Organization\r\nhas been active on all fronts where it has been needed,\r\nproviding aid to victims of catastrophes and natural\r\ndisasters and war.\r\nAt this stage, I would like to mention and welcome\r\naction taken in the field by the United Nations through\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and other organizations, such as the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) and the International Labour Organization\r\n(ILO).\r\nOn another matter, we would like to welcome\r\nprogress by the United Nations in the fight against the\r\nscourge of drugs. The United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme is a result of concerted efforts by the\r\nUnited Nations and Member States in the fight against the\r\nproduction, sale, demand for and traffic in, and the\r\nunlawful distribution of, drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances. Cameroon pledges and invites other States to\r\npledge unreservedly their support for the United Nations\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\r\nPsychotropic Substances in order to stop the scourge of\r\ndrugs.\r\nWe would like to emphasize the considerable efforts\r\nexerted by the United Nations to focus the attention of the\r\ninternational community, in the context of world\r\nconferences, on other questions of interest that require\r\ncollective action, which should be taken by the entire\r\ncommunity of nations. These concerns have been\r\nmanifested through the World Summit for Children, the Rio\r\nConference on Environment and Development, the World\r\nConference on Human Rights at Vienna, the International\r\nConference on Population and Development at Cairo, the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen, the\r\nCairo Conference on the Prevention of Crime, and Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women at Beijing. On the question\r\nof women, it is highly desirable that all States immediately\r\nfollow up on the decisions and recommendations of the\r\nBeijing Conference.\r\nBut these successes of our Organization that I have\r\njust mentioned may not have met the expectations of all\r\npeoples.\r\nFirst, in the area of international peace and security,\r\nthe Organization has not been able to prevent the spread of\r\nsources of tension and conflicts throughout the world. Until\r\nrecently, it has been practically powerless in the face of the\r\ntragedies of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Rwanda.\r\nIn the economic arena, the Organization,\r\nnotwithstanding the declaration of four United Nations\r\ndecades, has not succeeded in adopting declarations,\r\nprogrammes of actions and other strategies to bring about\r\nprogress and economic and social development in\r\ndeveloping countries. The proof is that conditions in these\r\ncountries are still unfavourable, and, in order to experience\r\ngrowth once again, they must engage in policies of\r\nstructural adjustment, the social burden of which has been\r\na source of major concern to their Governments. This is\r\ntrue also of the high price they must pay to join the\r\nmainstream of world trade in order to avoid further\r\nmarginalization.\r\nDevelopment is primarily the responsibility of States\r\nand the peoples concerned. Cameroon nevertheless believes\r\nthat the United Nations should, because of its universality\r\nand in the best interest of the international community as a\r\nwhole, help to ensure global solidarity and interdependence\r\nwith a view to promoting development for all. This means\r\nthat we must stop inveighing against Africa in uniformly\r\npessimistic, not to say doomsday, tones. This style is all\r\ntoo familiar and suggests that our continent is, in the\r\nhistory of the world, nothing but a passive onlooker. But\r\nwho, in all seriousness, can place at the sidelines of world\r\nevents an entire continent, with 700 million inhabitants\r\ntoday — 800 million in the year 2,000 — and with\r\nimmense natural, human, cultural and spiritual wealth? In\r\nthis connection, the Holy Father, speaking of Africa, on\r\nthe occasion of his recent second visit to Cameroon,\r\nappealed in his post-synod apostolic exhortation for\r\navoidance of any blanket condemnations of an entire\r\npopulation, an entire nation or, still worse, an entire\r\ncontinent.\r\nIn spite of the serious difficulties that it must\r\novercome, Africa is determined to shoulder responsibility\r\nfor its future. The sweeping changes which it is\r\nexperiencing today are nothing but the forerunners of a\r\nnascent order whose purpose will be to integrate our\r\ncontinent into the world of the third millennium. This\r\nprocess of transformation is already yielding fruit in most\r\nof our countries.\r\nAs regards Cameroon, I would like in this\r\nconnection, to emphasize our irreversible pursuit of the\r\nprocess of democratization begun by Presidency Paul\r\nBiya at the very moment he assumed power in 1982.\r\nBetween now and the end of this year, there will be\r\nsignificant progress in this process with the adoption of a\r\nnew Constitution allowing for greater democratic\r\nparticipation by the citizens of Cameroon in the\r\nmanagement of their own affairs, and a better balance\r\namong the various powers of Government.\r\nI would like to mention the impact our measures of\r\nrecovery and economic liberalization have had on various\r\nsectors of activity. Cameroon is enjoying self-sufficiency\r\nin food, and is beginning to enjoy growth again. Inflation\r\nhas been halted and macroeconomic balance in major\r\nareas has been re-established. In a word, there are signs\r\nof life in economic activity. Strengthened by the\r\ncredibility confirmed — had that really been needed —\r\nby the recent signing of the agreement with the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, my country is widening its\r\naction for the acceleration of its economic recovery.\r\nOur Organization is confronted with a sudden and\r\nunexpected acceleration of history. Never has there been\r\nsuch an acute sense of upheaval. The same questions keep\r\ncropping up everywhere: Will the world in the future be\r\nmeaningless? What will the world order be like in the\r\nfuture? Will the Organization have a hand in this new\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\norder? And, finally, will it have the ability to be the melting\r\npot for this? But, when all is said and done, the end of the\r\ncold war has brought fair weather.\r\nHowever, it is clear that, 50 years after its creation,\r\nthe Organization needs to turn over a new leaf. That being\r\nso, might it not be highly desirable for it to re-think its\r\nrole, its tasks, its functions, with a view not just to adapting\r\nto this new context, but to responding better to the ever-\r\nincreasing and ever-more-insistent aspirations of the peoples\r\nto peace and well-being? In any case, this is the desire of\r\nCameroon.\r\nThese are the responsibilities we would like the\r\nOrganization to shoulder in order to ensure a better world\r\nand a better future for the generation of the next\r\nmillennium. In this connection, the manner in which the\r\nUnited Nations discharges its responsibilities, or rather the\r\nsuccess of United Nations missions, will depend on the real\r\ncollective political will of its Member States.\r\nFor its part, Cameroon feels that the current thinking\r\non the restructuring of the Security Council augurs well for\r\nthe revitalization of the Organization. The same is true of\r\nthe successful outcome of peace-keeping efforts made\r\npossible by United Nations action and the concerted action\r\nof the international community in Cambodia, Central\r\nAmerica, Angola, Haiti, Mozambique and Eritrea. On the\r\nsame lines, the new diplomatic deals that are evolving in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia and the Middle East are undeniably\r\nvery encouraging developments.\r\nIn the final analysis, then, there is no reason not to\r\nbelieve that in the near future the peoples of regions where\r\nconflicts are continuing will, like so many others, have their\r\nrendezvous with peace.\r\nIn all of these cases, Cameroon has the feeling that a\r\nlasting solution will have to come through a meeting of the\r\npolitical wills of the chief protagonists and the collective\r\nwill of the international community.\r\nIn spite of the difficulties that have impeded action in\r\nthe areas both of peace-keeping and of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, the balance sheet of the Organization —\r\nthough certainly uneven — is not as negative as some\r\nwould have us believe. The celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations gives the international\r\ncommunity an ideal opportunity to consider the ways and\r\nmeans available to our Organization to carry out the\r\ncollective work of ensuring peace, security and prosperity\r\nfor all.\r\nThis anniversary must also be taken as an\r\nopportunity for renewal, for highlighting and praising the\r\nwealth of universality in the diversity in our Organization.\r\nThis is an opportunity to renew our pledge and\r\ncommitment to the purposes and ideals of the Charter.\r\nThis pledge and this commitment must be translated into\r\na strengthening of our determination and our ability to act\r\ncollectively so that, as was the wish of the founding\r\nfathers, we can save future generations from anguish,\r\nfear, poverty, suffering and all sorts of uncertainty, and so\r\nthat we may finally move forward along the path of\r\ntransforming the tools of war into the tools of peace.\r\nCameroon, for its part, is prepared to contribute.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of Djibouti, His Excellency Mr.\r\nMohamed Moussa Chehem.\r\nMr. Chehem (Djibouti) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The United Nations has today reached a historic\r\nturning-point for at this session, we are celebrating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of its founding. I am convinced that\r\nthis Assembly will benefit greatly from the President’s\r\nvast experience as a distinguished jurist. On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to extend to Mr. Freitas do\r\nAmaral my sincere congratulations on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly for a session which\r\nwill undoubtedly prove to be productive.\r\nWe are deeply indebted to Mr. Amara Essy for the\r\nactive and competent way in which he conducted the\r\nproceedings of the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly. It should indeed be noted that a number of\r\nproblems and reforms had the benefit of particular\r\nattention under his presidency.\r\nWe would also like to express our gratitude and our\r\nhigh regard to the Secretary-General for his enlightened\r\nand pragmatic leadership. Today, more than ever, the\r\nuniversality of the United Nations offers to many of us\r\nthe possibility of having our voices heard throughout the\r\nworld. We would also congratulate the Secretary-General\r\non his efforts to preserve and strengthen the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in its work for peace, collective security\r\nand development.\r\nThe situation in the world today, marked as it is by\r\na multiplicity of hotbeds of tension, demonstrates to us —\r\nif that were necessary — the paramount role of the\r\nUnited Nations. This is naturally a subject for reflection\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nand of course a useful matter for us to ponder when we\r\nanalyse our compliance with the Charter and the ideals set\r\nforth in it as we now stand on the threshold of an era\r\nwhich, without any doubt, will prove vital for mankind.\r\nToday, indeed, we are living in a different world — a\r\nworld which the end of the cold war has stripped of the\r\nstructures and priorities that were familiar to it. New crises,\r\ndifficult to understand and to which we must today find\r\nappropriate responses, have arisen in all parts of the world.\r\nNeither States nor even regions can deal with them\r\neffectively and individually.\r\nThe explosion of ethnic identities, too long suppressed,\r\nand the breaking up of States, have posed formidable\r\nchallenges to the international community, thus threatening\r\ninternational peace and security. The crises that are\r\nravaging the world today are not as specific as those of the\r\ncold-war era. Since they fall outside the focus of interest of\r\nthe great Powers, the responsibility for action falls on the\r\nUnited Nations. However, the absence of clear-cut\r\nmandates, plus the inadequacy of resources, is partially\r\nresponsible for the performance of the United Nations in its\r\nnew role as guarantor of peace. In the light of these\r\ncircumstances, it is no surprise that early intervention is\r\noften late in coming. But when the United Nations does\r\npossess the necessary resources and support, it can achieve\r\ncommendable results.\r\nThe persistence of social and economic crises, the\r\ncollapse of Governments and structures underlie this\r\noutbreak of civil conflicts in the world. It is clear that it is\r\nnot enough simply to separate the combatants and stop the\r\nfighting in order to eliminate the multidimensional causes\r\nof these conflicts. Until these causes are understood and\r\ncombated from the very outset of the crisis, we will never\r\nbe in a position to combat the flagrant acts of violence\r\nagainst civilian populations. Until we are ready to offer\r\nfirm resistance to injustice, to acts of aggression, to\r\ncontinuing violations of human rights and peoples, we will\r\nbe doomed to watching history repeat itself over and over\r\nagain. Recent experiences of the United Nations have\r\ndemonstrated this, but none of them is more revealing than\r\nthe history of Bosnia.\r\nNothing has contributed as much as Bosnia to\r\nengendering a feeling of outrage within the international\r\ncommunity. Although numerous resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof Bosnia, confirming the inadmissibility of the annexation\r\nof territory by force and condemning “ethnic cleansing”\r\nhave been adopted, the reaction of the international\r\ncommunity to the challenge posed by the Serbs has\r\nalways been hesitant and confused. The cost of this war\r\nin terms of loss of human life, hardship and material\r\ndestruction is frightening. Serb bombings have turned the\r\ndesignated “safe areas” into vast prisons. Sarajevo has\r\nsuffered by far the most from Serb strangulation.\r\nHowever, the fall of the “safe areas” of Srebrenica\r\nand Zepa marked a turning-point in the attitude of the\r\ngreat Powers in this long and bloody conflict. These acts\r\nof genocide undoubtedly constitute one of the greatest\r\nhumiliations for the international community since the\r\nSecond World War. The combined effects of bombings\r\nand diplomacy seem to have negated Serb domination on\r\nthe ground at the same time as it has promoted prospects\r\nfor peace. Furthermore, United Nations personnel and\r\nhumanitarian convoys are no longer exposed to Serb\r\nattacks thanks to the recent resolve shown by the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization. For the time being,\r\naggression is not paying off and the Serbs seem to have\r\npartially renounced their traditional tactic of murdering\r\ncivilians with impunity. Over all, developments in the\r\nsituation have dealt a new hand and breathed new life\r\ninto the peace process. We welcome this new attitude, but\r\npeace must be both durable and honourable for all people.\r\nBosnia, as a sovereign State, must be protected. Similarly,\r\nSarajevo must be preserved as a multiracial and\r\nmulticultural city.\r\nThe handshake between President Arafat and Prime\r\nMinister Rabin in September 1993 was a source of great\r\nhope and we can but rejoice further at recent events. The\r\nsecond phase of negotiations led to the signing in\r\nWashington of the Taba Accord on 28 September 1995.\r\nWe can only welcome that outcome. We encourage the\r\ntwo parties to persevere in their efforts to expedite the\r\nimplementation of these agreements. They must strive to\r\ncontain the violence of extremists and to take all\r\nnecessary measures to strengthen mutual trust, which will,\r\nundoubtedly, contribute to lasting peace.\r\nThe mutual recognition of Israel and of the PLO has\r\nopened up a tremendous opportunity to strengthen peace\r\nand development in the Middle East, as well as trading\r\nand economic potential for the entire region. These are\r\nthe stakes and neither of the parties, neither the\r\nPalestinians nor the Israelis, should underestimate the\r\nimportance of this new perspective.\r\nSometimes there are mixed feelings about United\r\nNations efforts around the world to contain hostilities and\r\nsettle disputes. The United Nations has effectively been\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nparalysed and hamstrung by the lack of resources and the\r\nabsence of any precise mandate during the crisis in\r\nRwanda. The establishment of the International Tribunal,\r\nfor Rwanda which is responsible for trying and prosecuting\r\nthe persons guilty of genocide has also been delayed.\r\nSerious political dialogue can be broached, because it\r\nwould be hard to deny that those who promoted,\r\nencouraged or committed crimes must be taken to court.\r\nFurthermore, the whole issue of the reconciliation and\r\nreconstruction of the country has failed because of\r\npersistent internal tension and delays in the deployment of\r\ninternational aid. An enormous task still lies ahead, not just\r\nin terms of the repatriation of refugees but also of the\r\nreconstruction of destroyed infrastructures, including\r\nhousing, schools and medical facilities.\r\nIn many respects, there are great similarities between\r\nthe situation in Burundi and that in Rwanda. To date,\r\nall-out civil war has been avoided but the situation remains\r\nextremely volatile. The region as a whole is in need of true\r\nreconciliation. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who is trying, through constant contact, dialogue\r\nand visits to the area, to resolve these complex problems.\r\nHis recent decision to appoint an experienced diplomat to\r\norganize a national conference to promote reconciliation\r\nand mutual understanding among the countries of the region\r\nis a wise decision.\r\nAfter almost two decades of fratricidal and destructive\r\nwarfare, Mozambique is today ready to begin the work of\r\nnational reconstruction following the peace process. We\r\nshould congratulate all the parties that have taken part in\r\nthe political transformation of Mozambique on having\r\nadhered to the peace process. Mozambique, with its\r\ntremendous potential for economic recovery and\r\ndevelopment, has a great future ahead, which it should turn\r\nto full advantage. This is a country for which the\r\ninternational community has every reason to congratulate\r\nitself for having given it timely support and substantial\r\nresources to back the peace process.\r\nIn Haiti, the refusal of the army to comply with the\r\npeace agreement and its intransigence in spite of the\r\ncondemnation of the international community left the\r\nUnited Nations with no alternative but to take resolute\r\naction, beginning with economic sanctions, and then\r\ninternational intervention. This made it possible for the\r\nUnited Nations to deploy a peace-keeping mission there.\r\nWith the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,\r\npolitical violence and human rights violations have been\r\ngreatly reduced. There is now a basis for ensuring the\r\nsecurity of the population, guaranteeing increased political\r\nparticipation and consolidating democracy.\r\nThe untiring efforts in the long and difficult\r\nnegotiations in Lusaka to restore peace in Angola finally\r\nled to an agreement on a general cease-fire and the\r\nestablishment of a government. The United Nations\r\nplayed a prominent role in these negotiations with the full\r\nsupport of three observer States. Much remains to be\r\ndone, but progress has been steady and positive. The\r\nfuture of Angola will depend on the political will and\r\ndetermination of its leaders to forge a new vision, a new\r\nnation.\r\nIn Liberia, the determination of the United Nations\r\nand of the countries of the region has made it possible\r\nfinally to conclude an agreement between the parties.\r\nHostilities are nearing an end, and a cease-fire is to be\r\nnegotiated. This agreement, concluded just a month ago,\r\ndoes not mean that our troubles are over, but we can see\r\nthe light at the end of the tunnel. The Liberian people\r\nseem determined to put a final end to this long and\r\ndestructive war, and it is the duty of the international\r\ncommunity to contribute to this long-awaited outcome the\r\nnecessary resources and substantial support.\r\nLast year, we witnessed the end of United Nations\r\noperations in Somalia, when it became clear that the\r\ndetermination of the various Somali parties to reach a\r\ncompromise in the interests of the people of Somalia was\r\nvisibly lacking. Somalia has fallen into oblivion. It is\r\nsuffering from total political paralysis. Once again, it is\r\nthe same old story: warfare among factions. The country\r\nmust be helped to get off to a new start in order to create\r\nbetter prospects for peace and stability.\r\nWe must recall that the prospect of a new civil war\r\nis more likely than ever. The spectre of famine is looming\r\non the horizon. And the personnel of international aid\r\norganizations faces a difficult choice: to accept a state of\r\nincreasing insecurity or to abandon the country to chaos.\r\nWe want to hope that, no matter how complex and\r\ndesperate the political situation in Somalia, the\r\ninternational community will not abandon that country\r\nand will continue to provide the necessary support to the\r\nSomalis, in particular in the realm of humanitarian\r\nassistance. We hope, moreover, that our brothers in\r\nSomalia will find the path to wisdom and engage in\r\nconstructive negotiations to put an end to the suffering of\r\nthe Somali people.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nMy country, the Republic of Djibouti, continues to\r\nface difficulties in our economic development that are\r\nexacerbated by the presence of refugees and displaced\r\npersons, which make up more than 25 per cent of our\r\npopulation. The pressure thus placed on our infrastructures,\r\nour medical services, our housing sector and on education\r\nand employment is more than we are able to deal with. The\r\ncumulative effects of the civil wars that have raged in\r\nrecent years, both in our country and in neighbouring\r\ncountries, and of natural disasters — drought as well as\r\nfloods — have seriously hindered our efforts in the area of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nA new era of peace and political stability has begun in\r\nmy country, which regained its reputation as an oasis of\r\npeace after the signing of the peace agreement of December\r\n1994 and the formation in June 1995 of a new Government\r\nthat reflected the new situation.\r\nOnce peace had been achieved, and without any\r\ntransition, we began the difficult process of redressing our\r\ncountry’s finances and economy, which had been seriously\r\naffected by the consequences of three years of internal\r\nconflict and the negative world economic situation.\r\nThe first phase of a vast restructuring programme,\r\nproposed by the Government and approved by the\r\nParliament, has just been launched through the\r\nimplementation of various measures involving severe\r\nbudgetary restrictions. In addition to these measures, we are\r\ncurrently negotiating with the International Monetary Fund\r\nand the World Bank for the means to carry out a structural\r\nadjustment programme. Furthermore, in accordance with the\r\nresolutions of the Copenhagen World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, we wish to preserve our social achievements,\r\nwithout which no lasting development can be envisaged.\r\nOn the regional level, Djibouti is still working towards\r\nthe establishment of a climate of cooperation in all areas.\r\nThe member countries of the Inter-Governmental Authority\r\non Drought and Development (IGADD) and of the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\n(COMESA) have great potential and resources, and IGADD\r\nand COMESA are the best instruments for harmonization\r\nand coordination to maximize the exploitation of these\r\nresources.\r\nOn the international scene, Djibouti has discharged\r\nproductively and responsibly its current term in the Security\r\nCouncil, and thanks all the countries that have supported it.\r\nOur participation in peace-keeping operations, particularly\r\nin Rwanda and Haiti, where Djibouti’s police and armed\r\nforces are currently serving, is one of the best proofs of\r\nthis.\r\nTogether with its neighbours, Djibouti hopes to be in\r\na position to struggle against, and overcome, the\r\nconsequences of instability and conflicts in our region.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s view that the work\r\nof the United Nations is frequently misunderstood. The\r\ndevelopment crisis is often overlooked because of the\r\npriority given the short-term alleviation of emergency\r\nsituations. But development is no less urgent — quite to\r\nthe contrary — because today development is a global\r\nissue, and peace, the economy, the environment, social\r\njustice and democracy are its various aspects. The\r\npressures created by poverty, unemployment and social\r\ndisintegration are no longer contained within individual\r\nfrontiers; they affect our entire “global village”, moving\r\nfrom country to country and from region to region. Only\r\nconsistent growth and lasting development will be able to\r\nhalt them. But, clearly, no country, no region can alone\r\nsuccessfully face these problems. Even the best-\r\nperforming economies will face high unemployment if\r\nworld economic growth is not sufficient to absorb their\r\nproduction. If we restrict ourselves to promoting growth\r\nin some sectors to the exclusion of others, the result of\r\nthe growth will be unimpressive.\r\nBut it is most surprising that despite the fact that\r\nworld economic growth yields sufficient resources to\r\neasily eliminate extreme poverty from the face of the\r\nEarth, poverty not only persists but continues to increase.\r\nThe world has a great need of an engine for growth\r\nworldwide, a role played by the United States\r\nimmediately after the Second World War, when it\r\nbroadened world markets. But we can no longer hope that\r\na single country will take on this function. Likewise,\r\noutdated international economic policies and institutions\r\nare standing in the way of investments, the creation of\r\ndevelopment programmes and the markets necessary to\r\nincrease demand in the third-world countries and\r\nconsequently stimulate economic growth.\r\nAside from this global reality, the difficulties faced\r\nby sub-Saharan Africa are sui generis. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself recently called the economic results in\r\nAfrica disappointing, even in the countries that are\r\nengaged in-depth reforms. Thirty-three of the 48 least-\r\ndeveloped countries in the world are in Africa. There are\r\nmany results of this state of affairs and they are well\r\nknown. The recent onslaught of ethnic conflicts and civil\r\nwars has greatly contributed to instability, to the many\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nfaces of poverty and to the underdevelopment of that\r\nregion. These conflicts have forced millions of people to\r\nseek refuge in other countries or to become displaced\r\npersons. The situation is particularly tragic for women and\r\nchildren.\r\nIf Africa is to have a serious chance to develop, the\r\ncrushing burden of foreign debt must be alleviated. The\r\nlong-term debt of the African continent, amounting to $37\r\nbillion, constitutes about one-half of the debt owed by all\r\nthe countries of the “third world”. Very few of those\r\ncountries are in a position to repay their debt.\r\nHowever, for Africa at least to come close to the\r\nobjective of 6 per cent of annual growth in its gross\r\ndomestic product, as envisaged by the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, would\r\nrequire substantial external assistance. Even those among us\r\nwho, in Africa, have opted for free markets and healthy\r\ncurrencies, view privatization and balanced budgets with\r\nscepticism.\r\nThis situation, exacerbated by the shocks created by\r\nstructural adjustment programmes and political reform, is\r\ncontinuing to intensify internal pressures and social\r\ntensions.\r\nIt is important to maintain aid levels during this\r\ntransitional period because this will contribute to stabilizing\r\nthe economic conditions that would permit the emergence\r\nof political and social conditions propitious to free\r\ninstitutions. Without such assistance, our fragile economies\r\nare threatened with collapse before they can even attempt\r\nto carry out their reforms. Yet, the fact is that for the\r\nmajority of African countries now engaged in this effort,\r\nthe flow of capital and assistance in all forms is beginning\r\nto dry up.\r\nAs the President of the General Assembly has rightly\r\nsaid, the world is passing through a transitional period that\r\nis still “vague, confused and imprecise” (Official Records\r\nof the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 1st meeting, p. 6). The effort to identify, to\r\nunderstand, to assign priorities and to try to remedy\r\nproblems whose dimensions have profoundly changed has\r\njust begun. It is revealing, indeed, that in his statement the\r\nPresident told the General Assembly that the new\r\ninternational order that is to be built must not leave out the\r\nUnited Nations, either by replacing it or by doing away\r\nentirely with it.\r\nFor the United Nations represents a concept of work,\r\nan expression of the idea whereby all mankind should\r\nunite its strength to solve problems and improve its\r\nconditions of life. To replace, weaken or marginalize the\r\nUnited Nations would constitute an assault on this\r\nconcept.\r\nThe United Nations, that is, mankind working\r\ntogether, should be the central mechanism through which\r\nthe world can achieve lasting growth and to lend\r\ncredibility and legitimacy to our efforts. Peace and\r\nsecurity remain important questions, but development and\r\neconomic and social problems are just as vital.\r\nThe structure of the United Nations should reflect\r\nthe realities and present problems as they really exist in\r\norder to tackle them in an effective, professional way.\r\nDjibouti favours the constant monitoring of United\r\nNations operations in order to define means and methods\r\nto eliminate all waste and reduce unnecessary costs.\r\nHowever, the improvement of the functioning and\r\nthe structure of the United Nations will prove of limited\r\nuse if the Organization does not have the resources it\r\nneeds to operate. The time has perhaps come to envisage\r\nnew methods for financing the United Nations. In\r\naddition, in the realm of collective security there is a vital\r\nneed to enlarge the Security Council, while respecting the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation, and to\r\nmake it more democratic and more transparent. The\r\nstructure and functions of the Council should be\r\nperiodically reviewed as the international situation\r\nevolves.\r\nIn conclusion, we are the United Nations, and the\r\nUnited Nations is us. Together we can achieve great\r\nthings.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on those representatives who have requested to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind Members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nstatement and five minutes for the second, and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMrs. Albright (United States of America): I wish to\r\nreply to remarks directed against the United States by the\r\nhead of the Iraqi delegation. I was stunned to hear the\r\nIraqi delegation speak about credibility. All of their\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nactions indicate that Iraqi foreign policy has no concept of\r\nthe meaning of the word.\r\nBut since he brought it up, let us discuss credibility.\r\nMany Members here today remember the Iraqi speaker here\r\none year ago affirming that Iraq’s intentions towards its\r\nneighbours were totally peaceful at the very moment when\r\nit was moving offensive forces towards the Kuwaiti border.\r\nLet us discuss the credibility of today’s remarks.\r\nAmong dozens of false statements in Iraq’s speech, the\r\nmost obviously unbelievable is the lie that “Iraq is well\r\naware of the fact that it is not in its interest to conceal any\r\ninformation relating to past weapons programmes” (supra,\r\np. 11)\r\nIn fact, concealing such information has been the\r\nconsistent policy of the Iraqi Government from 1991 until\r\ntoday. The Iraqi Foreign Minister, during several visits to\r\nNew York earlier this year, assured several members of the\r\nSecurity Council that Iraq had turned over to the Special\r\nCommission all documents relating to its weapons of mass\r\ndestruction programmes.\r\nIn August of this year, Iraq was forced to admit to\r\nwhat the Special Commission, the United States and most\r\nmembers of the Council had consistently believed: that Iraq\r\ncontinued to conceal documents relating to these\r\nprogrammes.\r\nLet me remind this body what Iraq was forced to\r\nreveal and how dangerous Iraq’s programmes were to all its\r\nneighbours. It had a crash programme to build a nuclear\r\nweapon in 1990-1991; it had weaponized live biological\r\nagents, including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms,\r\nweapons never before used in warfare; it produced a far\r\ngreater quantity of chemical weapons, in more diverse\r\nforms, than it had previously admitted; and it deliberately\r\nkept these documents hidden from the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM), even as it was claiming\r\nthat all information had been handed over. UNSCOM now\r\nhas a responsibility to be more careful and thorough than\r\never in verifying the complete dismantling of these\r\nprogrammes.\r\nAfter a constant four-year policy of deception, Iraq’s\r\ncurrent assertions have zero credibility in the Security\r\nCouncil, as was made manifestly clear at the last review of\r\nthe Iraqi sanctions.\r\nIraq is seeking to turn its disregard for Security\r\nCouncil resolutions into a bilateral issue between Iraq and\r\nthe United States. This is simply a misrepresentation of\r\nreality. Not a single member of the Security Council\r\nagrees with the assertion we have heard today that Iraq\r\nhas fulfilled its obligations under the relevant resolutions.\r\nIn fact, the only requirement that Iraq has fulfilled is the\r\nrecognition of Kuwait’s independence, sovereignty and\r\nborders, accomplished three and a half years after Iraq\r\npromised to do so. Every single member of the Council\r\ninsists that Iraq must comply fully with its obligations.\r\nThe great majority of the Council agrees that the\r\nsanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq is in overall\r\ncompliance with its obligations.\r\nThis is not the United States position; it is the\r\nUnited Nations position. The programme of the United\r\nNations is the programme of the United States: a change\r\nin Iraqi behaviour through implementation of the\r\nresolutions. Iraq’s continued refusal to return stolen\r\nKuwaiti property, to account for missing Kuwaitis, to end\r\nits support for terrorism and to cease the repression of its\r\ncitizens shows its contempt for the United Nations, its\r\nlack of peaceful intentions and the impossibility of the\r\nSecurity Council’s being able to trust Iraqi promises.\r\nActions, not words, are what will cause the international\r\ncommunity to treat Iraq differently.\r\nI found particularly inconsistent the Iraqi\r\ndelegation’s call for implementation of a zone free of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. In fact, Iraq is the only\r\ncountry in the region that has ever deployed biological\r\nweapons into a war zone. It is the only country in the\r\nworld that has ever used chemical weapons against its\r\nown civilian population. The United States is committed\r\nto the goal of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction\r\nin the Middle East, and is ready to work with any partner\r\nthat shares that goal. Iraq is a long way from such a\r\npartnership.\r\nWe have heard much recently about the impact of\r\nsanctions on the Iraqi population. So let us be clear: the\r\nSecurity Council, and the United States in particular, care\r\nfar more about the suffering of ordinary Iraqis than does\r\nthe Government of Iraq. It is precisely because of the\r\ndeep concern of the members of the Security Council that\r\nthey endeavoured yet again to pass a Security Council\r\nresolution — resolution 986 (1995) — that provides a\r\nfair, flexible and generous mechanism for humanitarian\r\nrelief in Iraq.\r\nWhy does the Iraqi Government refuse this\r\nreasonable offer? We are forced to conclude that it is\r\nSaddam Hussein’s cynical and cruel belief that by\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nmaintaining the suffering of the Iraqi people he will obtain\r\nsome sympathy from the world at large. Despite press\r\nreports today, we have no reason to believe that Baghdad\r\nis any more ready than in the past to accept this resolution.\r\nIf the Iraqi Government wants to restore its credibility,\r\nif it wants the world to believe that the tears it sheds over\r\nthe Iraqi people are not false, let it stop the excuses and\r\nshifting of blame. Let the Iraqi delegation’s next speech\r\ninclude an announcement that Iraq is prepared to use some\r\nof its oil wealth for the good of its people, rather than for\r\nthe personal enrichment of the ruling clique.\r\nThe Iraqi representative stated that Iraq had accepted\r\nthe terms of resolution 687 (1991) in 1991. There was no\r\nconfusion about the terms of that resolution then, and there\r\nis none now. All that remains is for Iraq to at last do what\r\nit promised more than four years ago.\r\nLet me, in conclusion, remind the Iraqi representative\r\nthat on a day when this body has heard such a stirring\r\nspeech from a religious leader respected around the world\r\nit is especially important to follow his words and those of\r\nreligious leaders of all faiths by speaking the whole truth\r\nand nothing but the truth.\r\nMr. Ghalib (Afghanistan): In response to the reply of\r\nthe delegation of Pakistan, my delegation would like once\r\nagain to draw the attention of the world community to the\r\nquestions contained in the statement made to this Assembly\r\nby the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan, to which the Pakistani authorities\r\nhave long failed to provide answers. My delegation would\r\nlike to reiterate that unless and until Islamabad halts its\r\nmilitant interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan\r\nthe prevailing state of peace, security and stability in the\r\nentire region will remain in jeopardy.\r\nThe comments made by the Pakistan delegation do not\r\naddress certain questions, such as, first, the fact of the\r\ncontinuous interference by the Pakistani intelligence\r\nservices — specifically Interservice Intelligence (ISI) — in\r\nthe internal affairs of Afghanistan, which met no evident\r\ndenial by the Pakistani delegation; and, secondly, the\r\nquestions regarding the made-up group of Taliban, such as\r\nthe site of its emergence, its military hardware and\r\nexpenditures, and its training and planning, as well as the\r\ntele-guided onslaught of the so-called Taliban, boosted by\r\nthe act of aggression by Pakistani militia in western\r\nAfghanistan, where the occupied territories are run by a\r\nPakistani by the name of Colonel Imam acting as de facto\r\ngovernor. These questions, too, were disregarded in\r\nPakistan’s reply and have yet to be answered.\r\nIn the light of these issues, my delegation would like\r\nto point out that, above all, the words of the Pakistani\r\ndelegation on the situation inside Afghanistan contradict\r\nthe solid principles of the United Nations Charter\r\ngoverning relations between countries — affirming the\r\ndevelopment of such relations on the basis of respect for\r\nequal rights and self-determination. Moreover, their\r\ncomments themselves contribute to and further strengthen\r\nthe evidence provided in our statement.\r\nIt is no secret that the Pakistani authorities have\r\nalways attempted to cover up their undeniable\r\ninvolvement in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan by\r\nmisinforming the world community, by propagating\r\nfabrications.\r\nMy delegation cannot conclude without saying that\r\nthe statements made by the Pakistani delegation not only\r\nillustrate their linkage with and sympathy and support for\r\nthe opposition, but actually sound like the opposition’s\r\nvoice in an international forum.\r\nMr. Gomersall (United Kingdom): My delegation\r\nwould also like to address remarks made earlier today by\r\nthe Iraqi Foreign Minister.\r\nIn his statement, the Foreign Minister of Iraq made\r\nthe familiar claim that others are to blame for the\r\nproblems of Iraq, and in particular for the maintenance of\r\nsanctions imposed after Iraq’s unprovoked aggression\r\nagainst Kuwait.\r\nThe problems of Iraq and the suffering of the Iraqi\r\npeople are the responsibility of the Government of Iraq,\r\nand of that Government alone. Even today, those\r\nproblems and that suffering are being prolonged and\r\naggravated by the actions of the régime. The sanctions\r\nremain in place simply because Iraq has failed to comply\r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions. The\r\nForeign Minister of Iraq must know that this is the\r\nposition not just of one delegation in the Security\r\nCouncil, but of many others, including the United\r\nKingdom.\r\nIraq’s latest admissions about its weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, after countless assurances that it had\r\nproduced full and final accounting of its past\r\nprogrammes, simply underlines the need for the Security\r\nCouncil to continue to act very cautiously.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nThe humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq have\r\nbeen addressed in a number of Security Council resolutions,\r\nmost recently resolution 986 (1995), which enables the\r\nregime to sell oil to feed its people, even while sanctions\r\nremain in place. The Government of Iraq still refuse to\r\nimplement this, thus inflicting continuing suffering upon\r\ntheir own people. That is the truth which unfortunately\r\nmost Iraqis are unable to hear.\r\nMr. Al-Qaysi (Iraq): My Foreign Minister made it\r\nclear in his statement that he did not want to be drawn into\r\npolemics with the representative of the United States. She\r\ncame to the Hall, she threw her vindictiveness, and she is\r\njust about to leave, joined by the representative of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, whose country’s name was never\r\nmentioned by my Foreign Minister, but who took it upon\r\nhimself, which is his own free choice, just to trail the\r\nUnited States in defence of the position of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIt is our perception that the position of these two\r\nStates is not the position of the Security Council. They took\r\nit upon themselves to speak on behalf of the Security\r\nCouncil collectively — and selectively, unfortunately —\r\nmissing so many facts that boil down in our favour.\r\nLet me pick up the question of credibility. What is\r\ncredibility? Credibility is an ethical value, and if it is an\r\nethical value then it should be followed by all. The two\r\nrepresentatives who have just spoken are telling the General\r\nAssembly that Security Council resolution 986 (1995) was\r\nadopted as a fair and flexible mechanism to provide\r\nnecessary care for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi\r\npopulation, within the framework of sanctions. That in itself\r\nis an admission that the sanctions imposed upon Iraq as a\r\nframework did not take care to provide for the necessary\r\nhumanitarian needs of the Iraqi population; otherwise, a\r\nnew resolution for it would not have needed to be adopted.\r\nWas it true that this resolution, as described by the\r\nrepresentative of the United States, was simply to sell oil to\r\nfeed the Iraqi people? Has she forgotten the political thorns\r\nthat were put into that resolution with a view to enabling\r\ntheir own plans for secession in Iraq and for interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of Iraq. Where is credibility here?\r\nLet me talk again about credibility when it comes to\r\nthe question of what they called concealment of\r\ninformation. Despite all that was said by Mrs. Albright,\r\nwhatever we found we gave to Ambassador Ekeus. The\r\ncrash programme she talked about in the nuclear field was\r\ndescribed by the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) as ridiculous, because they knew about it. Where\r\nis their credibility when they raise fears about past\r\nprogrammes, old stories, the information for which, in its\r\ntotality, was given to the Special Commission and to the\r\nIAEA? If they care about credibility, why do they not\r\nwait for these two responsible bodies to conclude, within\r\nthe time available, and come with their conclusion to the\r\nSecurity Council so that the Security Council can make\r\nthe correct assessment? Why have they fanned so many\r\nconcoctions against Iraq since August? Pelletreau roves\r\naround the capitals discussing the situation in Iraq; other\r\ncountries are drawn in support; there are lies about Iraqi\r\ntroops massing in order to attack neighbouring countries.\r\nIs that credible? I wonder.\r\nMrs. Albright said that there was no confusion about\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) in 1991 or now.\r\nBut who is confusing Security Council resolution 687\r\n(1991)? Is it not the official position of the United States\r\nthat paragraphs 21 and 22 of that resolution mean exactly\r\nthe same? Who is glossing that resolution with\r\ninterpretations that do not have any basis whatsoever in\r\nits provisions? It is not Iraq; Iraq is the weaker party\r\nhere. It is the United States of America.\r\nIn all our contacts with the members of the Security\r\nCouncil and with others it has been consistently pointed\r\nout to us “If the position of the United States is such and\r\nsuch, then we can make such and such a move”. The\r\nperception now is that there is no way to implement\r\nparagraph 22, even if the Special Commission concludes\r\npositively in favour of Iraq. Why? Because we are going\r\ninto an election year in the United States. Who does Mrs.\r\nAlbright think does not know about this in this Hall?\r\nEverybody knows it. Is this credible? Is this ethical under\r\nthe interpretation of the rules of the Security Council and\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations?\r\nWe have repeatedly called for dialogue, but the\r\nAssembly has heard Mrs. Albright and the representative\r\nof the United Kingdom. They do not want dialogue.\r\nBefore I close, I say finally to the representative of\r\nthe United Kingdom that he should know that the\r\nperception throughout the Arab world is that his country\r\nwas the cause of all the ills from which we are suffering.\r\nI say to Mrs. Albright in closing that there is a\r\nmarked difference between us and her. We look forward,\r\nbut she continues to cry over the past by looking\r\nbackwards.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 5 October 1995\r\nMr. Babar (Pakistan): We have heard yet again the\r\ntotally irrational statement of the representative of\r\nAfghanistan in his response to our statement in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply. Let me repeat once again that Pakistan’s\r\ncontribution to the Afghan cause is well known. We have\r\nhelped Afghanistan and its people during a very difficult\r\nperiod of their history. We have done so at great cost and\r\nsacrifice. We have played host to 3.5 million Afghans,\r\nincluding their leaders, for 14 long years. We continue to\r\nentertain the greatest sympathy for the people of\r\nAfghanistan, who are our brothers. More than 1.6 million\r\nof them still enjoy hospitality in Pakistan because of their\r\ndisillusionment with the regime in Kabul.\r\nWe do not understand or appreciate the vile\r\naccusations of a regime which is clinging to power\r\ndespite the loss of support of its own population. We said\r\nearlier that we have no preferences among the different\r\ngroups in Afghanistan, but we are interested in peace and\r\nstability in this neighbouring country, which alone would\r\nenable the Afghan refugees still in Pakistan to return to\r\ntheir homeland in honour and with dignity. Only the\r\npeople of Afghanistan can decide their own future. They\r\nno longer support a regime which is trying to rule the\r\ncountry on the basis of an ethnic minority. History tells\r\nus that such regimes do not survive.\r\nIn the interests of peace and harmony in a war-torn\r\ncountry, it is therefore necessary for the regime in Kabul\r\nto understand that a quick and early hand-over of power\r\nalone will enable the Afghan people to choose a\r\nGovernment which has the confidence and support of the\r\npeople. Meanwhile, we urge the representative of\r\nAfghanistan to refrain from trying to visit the frustrations\r\nof a discredited regime on others.\r\nMr. Ghalib (Afghanistan): My delegation would like\r\nto exercise its right of reply in relation to the comments\r\nmade by the Pakistani delegation at the next opportunity\r\nin the General Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.45 p.m.\r\n30\r\n"
