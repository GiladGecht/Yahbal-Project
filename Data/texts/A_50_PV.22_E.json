(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAnnouncement by the President\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\nthe Open-ended High-level Working Group on the\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations System, established by\r\nAssembly resolution 49/252 of 14 September 1995, will\r\nmeet next Monday, 9 October 1995, at 3 p.m. in the\r\nTrusteeship Council Chamber. All interested delegations are\r\ninvited to attend.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker this morning is the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of South Africa,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alfred Nzo, upon whom I now call.\r\nMr. Nzo (South Africa): Mr. President, I wish to\r\nextend to you, on behalf of the South African delegation,\r\nmy sincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nYour election demonstrates the high regard in which the\r\ninternational community holds your country. I should also\r\nlike to express our deep gratitude to your predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, a brother from Africa and the\r\nForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, who presided over the\r\nforty-ninth session with great wisdom. I should also like to\r\nexpress to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our continued confidence in\r\nhis guidance of the Organization.\r\nA half century ago representatives from 50 countries\r\nmet at San Francisco to draft the United Nations Charter,\r\nthe Declaration of Human Rights and the Statute of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. For the United Nations to\r\nhave survived for a period of 50 years in an imperfect\r\nworld is indeed a milestone and a tribute to the visionary\r\nsteps taken half a century ago towards the creation of a\r\nbetter world.\r\nSouth Africa’s involvement with the United Nations\r\ngoes back to the very conception and birth of this\r\nillustrious body. The then-Prime Minister of South Africa,\r\nField Marshal J. C. Smuts, helped to draft the Preamble\r\nto the Charter of the United Nations. In the Preamble\r\nmany lofty ideas were expressed, among which were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\r\nand small”.\r\nHow ironic that those in power in South Africa since\r\nthen, and until last year, acted in a precisely contrary\r\nspirit. The United Nations contributed significantly in\r\nbringing about change in South Africa. Through\r\nperseverance and commitment, the United Nations\r\nassisted us in our struggle to achieve democracy. Our\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nreward is its reward. I should like again to express the\r\ngratitude of both the people and the Government of South\r\nAfrica for its foresight and courage.\r\nJust over a year ago, on 23 June 1994 to be precise,\r\nI had the honour to address the Assembly on behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica. On that occasion, which marked South Africa’s\r\nresumption of its participation in the work of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations, we were filled with joy\r\nand pride at the peaceful transition of South Africa into a\r\nunited, non-racial, democratic and non-sexist society.\r\nIn the intervening months I have travelled to many\r\ncountries, visited with many foreign ministers and met with\r\nseveral Heads of State or Government. We spoke of the\r\nmiracle that is South Africa. We shared our thoughts and\r\nexperiences on the road to that miracle. In that context, we\r\ncontinue to encourage those who seek change for a better\r\nlife to stand fast in their belief.\r\nAs the representative of a Member of the United\r\nNations, I should like to reassure you of our belief in and\r\nsupport for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe events in April 1994 in South Africa marked a\r\nbreak with the past as well as a commitment to the future,\r\nplacing a heavy burden on us. As a young democracy, we\r\nare ready to meet the challenge. South Africa will meet this\r\nchallenge with a firm commitment to the promotion of\r\nnational welfare, prosperity and security, with a firm\r\ncommitment to the strengthening of cooperation in the\r\npursuit of the economic development and security of the\r\nsouthern African subregion, with an active commitment to\r\npeace, stability and good governance within the African\r\nregion and elsewhere, with a firm commitment to South-\r\nSouth cooperation and with a commitment to responsible\r\ninternational citizenship.\r\nThe Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) was conceived in the struggle for freedom in\r\nsouthern Africa and born of the courage of its leaders in\r\nsetting out to create a new reality.\r\nThe liberation of South Africa and the end of southern\r\nAfrica’s destabilization brought great opportunities for the\r\ndevelopment of our subregion. We must now translate those\r\nhopes into reality. In accordance with the Abuja Treaty, we\r\nmust transform the southern African region into one of the\r\nreliable building blocks on which Africa’s economic\r\nregeneration will be built.\r\nOur greatest need today is to eradicate the scourge\r\nof poverty afflicting the great mass of our people. Only\r\nthen can we fulfil the dream of Africa’s liberation in the\r\nhealth, happiness and well-being of its children.\r\nThe mission of SADC reflects the reality that\r\nsouthern Africa has long since passed the stage of\r\nlamenting the privations of the past. The challenge is to\r\nfind within ourselves the resources to overcome this\r\nlegacy, with the cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity. We need to adapt to the demands of a rapidly\r\nchanging world economy and to develop the skills needed\r\nto compete internationally.\r\nSouth Africa’s main objective is to play a\r\nconstructive role in bringing peace and stability to the\r\nregion. We are totally committed to the utilization of\r\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking,\r\nthrough the use of regional and multilateral mechanisms.\r\nIn this context, South Africa participated with others\r\nin the resolution of the conflict in Lesotho and provided\r\nlogistical support for the elections in Mozambique. Our\r\nsupport for United Nations resolutions and actions\r\nregarding Angola and the Western Sahara should also be\r\nseen in that light.\r\nAs an elected member of the Central Organ of the\r\nConflict Resolution Mechanism of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) from June 1994 to June 1995, we\r\nparticipated in several missions to Burundi. South Africa\r\nwas part of a special four-member ministerial mission\r\nelected to assess the nature and the scope of the Burundi\r\nconflict with a view to encouraging and assisting the\r\nBurundians to resolve their differences and end that\r\nconflict. We continue to participate in the Mechanism as\r\nan invited observer.\r\nIn view of the desperate situation in the former\r\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda, it has become imperative for\r\nStates to cooperate as far as possible with the respective\r\nad hoc criminal tribunals that have been created for those\r\nterritories. In that regard, my country has made available\r\nsome of its most talented jurists to assist.\r\nThese situations have demonstrated anew the real\r\nneed for the establishment of a permanent international\r\ncriminal court. This issue has been revitalized in the past\r\nfew years, and a window of opportunity now exists to\r\nfinally bring the court into existence. It is my sincere\r\nhope that significant progress will be made in that regard\r\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, mankind is still faced with political instability,\r\ndictatorship, corruption, civil war, millions of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons, persistent economic decline\r\nand continued impoverishment.\r\nIn the past year, the international political climate has\r\nexperienced a succession of changes which have brought\r\nboth hope and a certain measure of despair to mankind.\r\nHope has, however, remained a beckoning beacon bringing\r\nabout a sense of confidence in the future. We were\r\nsaddened by events in Somalia, but rejoiced at the transition\r\nin Haiti and El Salvador. We despair at the tragedy that is\r\nBosnia, yet hope that the emerging signs of a solution will\r\ncome to fruition.\r\nIn this spirit, allow me to congratulate the peoples of\r\nIsrael and Palestine on having reached yet another landmark\r\nin their journey towards a lasting settlement. We encourage\r\nand support the Middle East peace process.\r\nThe issues of proliferation and disarmament, in\r\nparticular nuclear disarmament, are among the major\r\nquestions that have been facing the international community\r\nin recent times. At the historic 1995 Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), all those present\r\nagreed to exercise the utmost restraint pending the entry\r\ninto force of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are of the\r\nview that the recent tests conducted by two nuclear-weapon\r\nStates are retrogressive steps in the international\r\ncommunity’s endeavour to ban nuclear testing. We believe\r\nthat these tests will negatively affect the outcome of work\r\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The South African\r\nGovernment is strongly opposed to these and any further\r\nnuclear tests being conducted, and calls upon those States\r\nto cease testing, so as to enhance international efforts\r\ntowards non-proliferation and disarmament. We call upon\r\nthem to honour both the letter and the spirit of the\r\nPrinciples and Objectives which they agreed to and helped\r\nnegotiate at the NPT Review and Extension Conference.\r\nSouth Africa has dismantled its nuclear capability. South\r\nAfrica, for its part, has proven its commitment to nuclear\r\ndisarmament. Now it is the turn of others to manifest a\r\nsimilar commitment.\r\nSouth Africa notes with great satisfaction the progress\r\nachieved thus far towards the establishment of an African\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. We have been actively involved\r\nin trying to find solutions to the outstanding issues, and we\r\ntrust that these hurdles can be overcome and the draft treaty\r\nof Pelindaba can receive due consideration during this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The draft treaty is\r\nimportant as it would expand the non-nuclear-weapon\r\narea of the globe considerably and would be a further step\r\ntowards the final goal of complete nuclear disarmament.\r\nSouth Africa appeals to the nuclear-weapon States to\r\nensure that the draft treaty is concluded and the relevant\r\nprotocols signed.\r\nSince the 1986 declaration of the Zone of Peace and\r\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, significant progress has\r\nbeen made in the political, economic, scientific, technical\r\nand cultural spheres to further the objectives of the Zone.\r\nOnly relatively few obstacles remain. We hope to advance\r\nthis endeavour when the next meeting of participating\r\nnations takes place in Cape Town in March 1996.\r\nOn 13 September 1995 South Africa became the\r\nthirty-seventh State party to the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\r\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\r\nOn the same day South Africa also acceded to the\r\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\r\nto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate\r\nEffects. The ratification of the chemical weapons\r\nConvention again underlines the commitment of the\r\nGovernment of National Unity to the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. South Africa’s accession to\r\nthe Convention on certain conventional weapons\r\nunderlines my Government’s commitment to the\r\nelimination of the suffering that is caused by the scourge\r\nof war. South Africa has, for this reason, decided to\r\nextend its moratorium on the export of land-mines by the\r\nintroduction of a permanent ban on the export or sale of\r\nlong-lived anti-personnel land-mines. Furthermore, on\r\n30 August 1995 the Government of National Unity\r\napproved the draft of a new conventional-arms-control\r\npolicy. A National Conventional Arms Control Committee\r\nhas been established and will function in accordance with\r\npredetermined guiding principles and criteria to ensure\r\nthat arms trade and transfers conform to accepted\r\ninternational practice.\r\nAs previously mentioned, the principal role of the\r\nUnited Nations is to safeguard international peace and\r\nsecurity in order to implement universal respect for\r\nhuman rights and to create conditions necessary for\r\nsustainable development. Without peace, security and\r\nhuman rights, sustainable development will be difficult to\r\nachieve. Without development and respect for human\r\nrights, international peace and security will continually be\r\nthreatened.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nAs President Mandela stated in 1992,\r\n“Our common humanity transcends the oceans\r\nand all national boundaries. It binds us together in\r\ncommon cause against tyranny, to act together in\r\ndefence of our very humanity. Let it never be asked of\r\nany one of us what we did when we knew that\r\nanother was oppressed.”\r\nMankind should learn to act against all tyranny in a\r\nunified manner through the United Nations. This should be\r\nour basic aim for the future.\r\nSouth Africa also wishes to call attention to the\r\nactivities of mercenaries, irrespective of their origin and\r\nobjectives. Their destabilizing activities cannot be tolerated.\r\nWe call on the international community and the United\r\nNations to be seized of this problem of mercenaries.\r\nThe women of South Africa have lived, in varying\r\ndegrees, under three forms of oppression, relating to race,\r\nto class and to gender. One of the first steps towards\r\ninitiating positive change in the lives of all South African\r\nwomen was the entrenchment of gender rights in our Bill\r\nof Rights. It was with much pride that the South African\r\ndelegation took their seats at the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women, in Beijing. That was the first time South Africa\r\nparticipated in a conference on women which focused on\r\nthe eradication of poverty, and equal access to education\r\nand to health services. South Africa is fully committed to\r\nimplementing the Platform for Action adopted at that\r\nConference, which will serve as the impetus for a world of\r\nequality, development and peace for all. In addition, our\r\nParliament has most recently approved South Africa’s\r\nratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women, without any\r\nreservations.\r\nYears of apartheid rule have bequeathed the\r\noverwhelming majority black population with a heavy\r\nlegacy of poverty, social disintegration and political\r\ncleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities. It\r\ntherefore became the priority task of the South African\r\nGovernment of National Unity to devise a national strategy\r\nto address this catastrophic situation. A comprehensive and\r\nmulti-pronged developmental strategy known as the\r\nReconstruction and Development Programme is now being\r\nimplemented. The implementation of this Programme relies\r\nprimarily on the mobilization of domestic resources through\r\nprioritization of budgetary resources, with a view to\r\naddressing the huge material inequalities in such areas as\r\neducation, health, housing, infrastructure development and\r\nland reform. It is a unique people-centred and people-\r\ndriven Programme, which seeks to translate into economic\r\nbenefit the political miracle in our country. At the very\r\nheart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of the\r\ninextricable interdependence between the need for\r\ntransparent, accountable and democratic governance of\r\nour society and the imperative of dynamic economic\r\ngrowth and sustainable development.\r\nSouth Africa will host the ninth United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX)\r\nfrom 26 April to 11 May 1996. This is an event which all\r\nSouth Africans are looking forward to with great\r\nexpectation. Indeed, it is my pleasure to announce that\r\nour preparations are well advanced and on course.\r\nWe attach great significance to UNCTAD IX for a\r\nnumber of reasons. We believe that the rapid progress of\r\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy has\r\nunderscored the relevance and importance of UNCTAD\r\nas a United Nations institution with a strong development\r\nmandate and perspective. We also believe that the\r\nsuccessful completion of the Uruguay Round of\r\nnegotiations and the resultant creation of the World Trade\r\nOrganization not only has stressed the validity and\r\nrelevance of UNCTAD, but has also reinforced the need\r\nto retain and strengthen UNCTAD’s mandate as a policy-\r\noriented global intergovernmental forum on trade and\r\ndevelopment issues. It is a forum where a strong\r\npartnership for development between the developed and\r\nthe developing countries can, and must, be forged. While\r\nthere may be a need to streamline certain UNCTAD\r\nactivities, this should not lead to its demise. Without\r\nUNCTAD, our world, especially the developing world,\r\nwould be the poorer.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my\r\nGovernment’s satisfaction with the intergovernmental\r\nprocess at the United Nations to draw up a United\r\nNations Agenda for Development. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations is the appropriate forum for the\r\nelaboration of the Agenda for Development. The Agenda\r\nfor Development could open great possibilities for\r\ndevelopment and for partnership between the developed\r\nand the developing countries. It is for this reason that\r\nSouth Africa is taking great interest in the work of the Ad\r\nHoc Open-ended Working Group of the General\r\nAssembly on an Agenda for Development.\r\nMy Government has been following with great\r\ninterest the ongoing High-level Intergovernmental\r\nMeeting on the Mid-term Global Review of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries. In this connection, I join others in\r\ncalling on the international community to devise a global\r\nstrategy to effectively address the debt question confronting\r\nthe least developed countries, and to use innovative\r\nmeasures — whether it be official development aid, foreign\r\ndirect investment or multilateral financial assistance — to\r\narrest the decline of resources destined for the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nI would also like to call upon the international\r\ncommunity to vigorously pursue measures required to\r\nsuccessfully implement the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. We are pleased in\r\nthat regard by the progress registered during the Economic\r\nand Social Council’s session in Geneva, especially the high-\r\nlevel segment, which was devoted to the aforementioned\r\nAgenda. Of course, the challenge before the international\r\ncommunity is to find adequate resources to translate this\r\nAgenda into tangible results. It is our hope that this issue\r\nwill be treated with the required urgency, given that next\r\nyear there will be a mid-term global review of the New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa.\r\nRecognizing the importance of cooperation between\r\ndeveloping States, South Africa has acceded to an\r\nagreement establishing the South Centre. The South Centre\r\nwill effectively operate as a policy research unit for the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77, and will draft\r\npolicy-oriented position papers on issues of critical\r\nimportance to the South. It will, in addition to this basic\r\nfunction, generate ideas and proposals for consideration by\r\nGovernments of the South and other institutions.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment engendered a process of environmental action\r\nand awareness centred on the relationship between\r\neconomic development and the sustainable management of\r\nthe environment. It is our duty to carry this process forward\r\nin an integrated manner and reconfirm our commitment to\r\nthe implementation of international agreements which seek\r\nto manage and preserve the world’s environment.\r\nSouth Africa is very conscious that the capacity of\r\ndeveloping countries to implement sustainable\r\nenvironmental strategies will have to be strengthened. The\r\nresources pledged towards the attainment of goals set out in\r\nAgenda 21 will have to be made available if we are to\r\nsucceed in achieving the imperatives of development,\r\nsustainable use of the environment, and democracy in the\r\nworld.\r\nIn Africa, in particular, the ravages of drought and\r\nthe advances of desertification require urgent attention.\r\nThe global community’s concern for the environment\r\nshould be reflected in a common approach to the\r\nmanifold environmental pressures threatening our global\r\nheritage.\r\nThe United Nations also has an important role to\r\nplay in assisting States threatened by natural or man-made\r\ndisasters. Preventive diplomacy can contribute towards\r\neliminating man-made disasters. However, the results of\r\nboth man-made disasters and natural disasters can be\r\nameliorated by effective international humanitarian\r\nassistance coordination through the United Nations. This\r\nwill naturally require more coherent programmed delivery\r\nand coordination by the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\r\nNations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) and\r\nother international institutions. The United Nations will\r\nhave to ensure that the necessary capacities and\r\nmechanisms are created. Recent international action,\r\nespecially the follow-up to the Tokyo Conference, has\r\ndemonstrated that sufficient international will exists to\r\nperform this function.\r\nWe welcome the adoption on 14 September 1995 of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/252, on the strengthening\r\nof the United Nations. I wish to assure the Assembly of\r\nour intention to work constructively with the President in\r\nthis endeavour.\r\nThe world in which we find ourselves today is\r\ngreatly changed from just 10 years ago. The cold war has\r\nended, the scourge of apartheid has been removed from\r\nour common society and peace has come to Mozambique\r\nand now Angola. We have also seen the membership of\r\nour United Nations increase to 185, a substantial increase\r\nsince the time the Security Council’s membership was last\r\nincreased. As a result of these, and other, factors the\r\ninternational community faces a window of opportunity\r\nwithin which the Security Council can be successfully\r\nrestructured and reformed.\r\nWithin the overall effort to reform the United\r\nNations, South Africa believes that the structure and\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council should be reformed to\r\nmake it more representative, democratic and transparent.\r\nThe product of these efforts must be a Security Council\r\nthat is effective and legitimate, and that reflects the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nrealities of our modern world. This result can be achieved\r\nonly if reform and restructuring is dealt with as a package.\r\nOne of the products of this reform process must result in\r\nAfrica having equitable representation on any enlarged\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIt would be appropriate for me to conclude by\r\nreferring to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe people of South Africa will celebrate this fiftieth\r\nanniversary in concert with the rest of the world. Our\r\nNational Committee organizing the events in our country\r\nhas adopted the following as its Declaration of Intent:\r\n“To create an awareness among the peoples of South\r\nAfrica of the role which the United nations can play\r\nin their daily lives, and to assist the United Nations in\r\nresponding to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.”\r\nPresident Mandela looks forward to joining his fellow\r\nworld leaders in a few weeks’ time to celebrate the\r\nvisionary step taken half a century ago towards the creation\r\nof a better world. Building on the successes and victories\r\nof the past, we now embrace the future. We can face the\r\nchallenges ahead, inspired by a vision of a new world\r\nwhere peace and respect for human dignity are the standard.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tourism and\r\nInternational Transport of Barbados, Her Excellency\r\nMs. Billie Miller.\r\nMs. Miller (Barbados): It is my pleasure to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of this\r\nhistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly. The\r\nBarbados delegation shares the confidence expressed in\r\nyour leadership, and offers our full cooperation as you\r\npreside over the deliberations of this landmark event.\r\nI also commend your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, not only for his outstanding stewardship of the\r\nAssembly during the last year, but for the vision and\r\ndirection he has given to the ongoing work designed to\r\nfashion the United Nations of the twenty-first century.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to extend a warm\r\nwelcome to a fellow member of small island developing\r\nStates, the Republic of Palau, whose admission to the\r\nUnited Nations took place in December 1994.\r\nFifty years ago, the United Nations rose from the\r\nashes of a devastating world war. Understandably, the\r\nOrganization was shaped and influenced by the\r\nexperience of that war and by the coalition of Powers that\r\nprevailed in 1945. It also grew to reflect the forces\r\nunderpinning the post-war system of international\r\nrelations — a system characterized by that paralysis of\r\ninternational political will known as the cold war.\r\nYet, to its credit, the United Nations has fostered\r\nremarkable progress on such vital issues as\r\ndecolonization, development and human rights, as well as\r\non a wide array of international standards, which we have\r\ncome to take for granted. Through its extensive network\r\nof organs and specialized agencies, the United Nations\r\nsystem has made tangible and lasting improvements in the\r\nlives of men, women and children all over the world.\r\nBut that old order has come to an end, and we face\r\nanew a world of tumultuous global change. Barbados sees\r\nthis world through the eyes of a member of the small\r\nisland developing States — joint products of\r\ndecolonization and the relative geopolitical stability that\r\nthe United Nations has ensured since our independence.\r\nAs a group, we have had mixed success in transforming\r\nthe legacies of colonial tutelage into genuine and\r\nsustained development for our peoples.\r\nAs small and fragile members of the global\r\ncommunity, we are constantly reminded of our own\r\neconomic and political vulnerability. For us, what happens\r\noutside our borders, beyond our control, whether man-\r\nmade or natural, sometimes has more impact on our way\r\nof life than anything we may do at home. One hurricane\r\ncan wipe out, in a matter of hours, an entire small island\r\neconomy. Only three weeks ago, Hurricane Luis wrought\r\nsuch devastation on a number of our Caribbean\r\nneighbours, causing major set-backs in their economic\r\ndevelopment. We extend our sincere sympathy to our\r\nbrothers and sisters at this time of distress. Barbados is\r\ncooperating fully with others in helping to restore normal\r\nlife to these Caribbean Member States.\r\nFor small island States, how we recover from\r\ndisasters such as this, and perhaps more important, how\r\nwe work towards ensuring that we make ourselves less\r\nvulnerable: these are paramount to our survival. Clearly,\r\nshort-term assistance and the sympathy of the\r\ninternational community, while crucial, are not enough.\r\nSmall size also means that our entire society, not just\r\nareas of it, is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the\r\nglobal economic system, including currency and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\ncommodity price fluctuations, new international trading\r\narrangements, and the changing fortunes of the major\r\nindustrial economies.\r\nNotwithstanding these natural or man-made\r\nconstraints, many small island States, including my own,\r\nhave achieved rising per capita incomes and improved\r\nhuman development indicators but such indices provide\r\nonly an approximate measure of the present, based on the\r\npast. They do not, and cannot, measure our vulnerability,\r\nthe resilience or lack of resilience of our economies and\r\nentire societies in the face of natural disasters and rapid\r\nglobal economic change.\r\nIt is in this broad context that Barbados has given the\r\nhighest importance to the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, which my country had the honour to host last year.\r\nThe Programme of Action, adopted by consensus,\r\nunderscores the role which the stewardship of small island\r\nStates plays in the preservation of the global commons. We\r\nurge international action to step up the support pledged in\r\nthe Declaration of Barbados and the Programme of Action.\r\nMy delegation therefore calls for the steady implementation\r\nof the commitments and recommendations contained in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/122 of 19 December 1994.\r\nAs a small vulnerable State, Barbados views some\r\nareas of the global political scene with deep concern.\r\nFollowing the end of the cold war, the people of the world\r\nyearn for an era of peace and economic prosperity — but\r\npeace, so far, has proved elusive. The outbreak of violence\r\nand ethnic strife has reached unspeakable levels of human\r\nsuffering, taxing the capacity of the United Nations support\r\nsystem to the limit.\r\nIn the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the large\r\nmajority of Member States looks on in agony and\r\nhelplessness at a crisis which has called into question the\r\nvery credibility of the Organization and the integrity of its\r\npeace-keeping function. We recall words of the late Sir\r\nWinston Churchill today: But Bosnia has not been the\r\nUnited Nations “finest hour”. But let us not forget that the\r\nUnited Nations is no more, no less, than the collective will\r\nof the Governments it serves.\r\nFor vulnerable small States, United Nations protection\r\nis critical. Developing countries, particularly those least able\r\nto afford it, bring no influence to bear on major peace-\r\nkeeping decisions, yet must pay their assessed share of\r\npeace-keeping costs, diverting scarce resources from the\r\ndevelopment effort. Barbados welcomes the encouraging\r\nsigns which have recently emerged from the peace\r\nprocess between the parties of former Yugoslavia, and\r\nhopes that an end could be soon brought to the strife and\r\nbloodshed in this war-torn region.\r\nBarbados shares the anguish of the people in the\r\nstrife-torn countries of Africa, in particular, Rwanda,\r\nBurundi, Liberia, and in similar areas of conflict around\r\nthe world, and hopes for early progress towards lasting\r\npeace in those areas. At the same time, we welcome the\r\npositive developments in the peace process in Angola and\r\nthat between Israel and Palestine. We hope that a peaceful\r\nand durable settlement to the problems elsewhere in the\r\nMiddle East may soon be reached.\r\nIn Haiti, where democracy is beginning to take root,\r\nBarbados is proud to have participated in the multilateral\r\ninitiatives and mission which resulted in the return of\r\nHaiti’s democratically elected government. The return of\r\nPresident Aristide underscores this continuing success and\r\nthis continuing process. Haiti is a prime example of a\r\nvulnerable small island State receiving, at long last, the\r\nsupport and protection needed from its neighbours and the\r\ninternational community. Much still needs to be done if\r\nHaiti’s recovery and development, long neglected in the\r\nface of political turmoil, are to be assured.\r\nWe urge the international community to stay the\r\ncourse with Haiti. We know that progress will be uneven,\r\nbut we applaud the Government’s commitment to the\r\ndemocratic process. Haiti is a Caribbean country with\r\nwhich Barbados shares strong bonds of history and\r\nculture. The Haitian people can be assured of our support\r\nin their struggle to nurture its fledgling democracy, and\r\nimprove the economic and social conditions of its people.\r\nBarbados applauded the decision of the United\r\nNations last May when it extended indefinitely, the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). But\r\nnow the spirit of this agreement has become a casualty of\r\nrecent events. Barbados deeply regrets the decision by\r\nsome States to resume nuclear testing, which runs counter\r\nto the spirit of the NPT and the commitment by nuclear\r\nweapons States to exercise the utmost restraint, pending\r\nentry into force of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban\r\ntreaty. As a small island developing State and a non-\r\nnuclear-weapon State, Barbados has a vested interest in\r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\r\ndisarmament of existing nuclear stockpiles.\r\nBarbados therefore supports the moratorium on the\r\ntesting of nuclear weapons in place, and urges nuclear\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nPowers to heed the call by the international community to\r\nrefrain from any activity that violates the spirit of the\r\nTreaty. As an island State whose people depend on the sea\r\nfor a large part of their livelihood, Barbados is gravely\r\nconcerned about the potential danger to its fragile marine\r\necosystems. We are therefore implacably opposed to the\r\ntransshipment of nuclear materials and hazardous wastes\r\nthrough the Caribbean basin.\r\nInternational terrorism, transnational crime, drug\r\ntrafficking and money-laundering, are matters of grave\r\nglobal concern, particularly to a small country like\r\nBarbados. The destabilizing threat of related cartels to the\r\ndemocratic order in small States is particularly serious.\r\nWhile Barbados has been put on full alert, we recognize\r\nour limited capacity to effectively police our own borders.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the bilateral assistance in this area,\r\nand will continue to work closely with other regional\r\npartners and related international bodies to combat this\r\nglobal cancer.\r\nThe year 1995 is a special one for the United Nations.\r\nIt is a year for solemn reflection on the mission and\r\nachievements of the Organization, and for new directions to\r\nmeet the challenges ahead.\r\nThe world we face is characterized by increasing\r\nglobalization of production, liberalization of trade, and an\r\nexplosion of information technology. Increasingly, States\r\nfind themselves restricted in their capacity to control or\r\ninfluence the flow of international capital, other than by\r\nproviding hospitable conditions to attract it. Moreover, there\r\nis an emerging consensus on the reordering of the role of\r\nthe State in economic development, in the direct creation of\r\nwealth and in the complementary nature of the public and\r\nprivate sectors.\r\nA significant feature of this changed world is the\r\nemergence of non-governmental organizations as a major\r\ninfluence in domestic and international public policy.\r\nBarbados welcomes this participatory power of civil\r\nsociety, which has deepened and enriched the debate on\r\ninternational issues and helped shape the global agenda to\r\nbetter reflect the popular will.\r\nThe framers of the Charter demonstrated this foresight\r\nin the Preamble, not with the words “We the\r\nGovernments”, but with the words “We the peoples”. And\r\nas we approach the new millennium, the slow but sure\r\ntriumph of peoples over institutions is becoming\r\nincreasingly evident. An appreciation and analysis of these\r\nglobal changes is critical to a reformed United Nations if it\r\nis to meet the challenge of the twenty-first century while\r\nremaining faithful to the original ideals of the Charter.\r\nBut good governance still is, and always will be, the\r\nbest instrument for the expression of the popular will.\r\nGovernment is, after all, when exercised responsibly and\r\naccountably, a profoundly moral vocation. And just as\r\nGovernments cannot, domestically, retreat from that moral\r\nfunction of fostering peace and upholding justice and\r\nliberty, neither can they do so internationally.\r\nBarbados supports the reform process. A reformed\r\nUnited Nations system should be cost-effective and\r\nefficient. The process should be orderly and informed by\r\nsolid analytical work, with decisions based on rigorous\r\nevaluation of the mandates and performance of affected\r\ninstitutions and their relevance to the changing demands\r\nof developing countries. In this connection, Barbados\r\nbelieves that the abolition of the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization and the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development would be\r\npremature. Restructuring of these institutions may well be\r\nwarranted, but due process should first be served.\r\nReform of the United Nations must not mean an\r\nabandonment of international cooperation and a retreat\r\ninto isolationism by the strong and powerful among us.\r\nThe growing interdependence on which the welfare of all\r\nour people depends makes isolationism an irresponsible\r\nfantasy. The problems that beset us — the degradation of\r\nthe environment, the plight of the poor and the\r\ndispossessed, narco-trafficking and money-laundering,\r\nhuman rights abuses, and, especially, ensuring the equal\r\nrights of women and children — can be solved only\r\nthrough more intense international cooperation.\r\nLet us by all means streamline this Organization and\r\nits allied agencies. Let us make them more effective in\r\nthe delivery of programmes of direct benefit to our\r\npeoples. But let not calls for better management and\r\nincreased efficiency cloud any lack of resolve by the\r\nmore fortunate among us to discharge their international\r\nresponsibilities, or hamper the Organization’s capacity to\r\nfulfil the mandates entrusted to it by Member States.\r\nThe United Nations has before it a daunting task. It\r\nmust enlarge the Security Council to better reflect the\r\nrealities of membership since 1965 as well as the\r\ngeopolitical changes in the global environment. In\r\nparticular, it must redesign its peace-keeping machinery\r\nto cope with the changing nature of conflicts in today’s\r\nworld — namely, conflicts mainly within nations, not\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nbetween nations. Barbados supports the structure for such\r\nreform contained in “An Agenda for Peace”, and salutes the\r\nSecretary-General for his distinctive leadership on this\r\ncrucial issue.\r\nIn the economic and social fields, the United Nations\r\nmust intensify its support to the development effort of\r\ndeveloping countries. Barbados supports the framework for\r\nan “Agenda for Development”, prepared by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The United Nations now has before it a\r\ncomprehensive development agenda created by the\r\ncontinuum of United Nations Conferences in New York, in\r\nRio, in Vienna, in Barbados, in Cairo, in Copenhagen and\r\nin Beijing. Barbados reaffirms the central role of women in\r\ndevelopment, which is acknowledged in the respective\r\nProgrammes of Action of all these Conferences. Women\r\nbring their unique perspective to the development\r\nprocess — and without it, the whole is impoverished.\r\nImplementation of these expanded programmes is\r\ncrucial. They must be carried out with commitment and\r\ndispatch. But even with expected improvements in\r\nefficiency, these critical tasks cannot be accomplished\r\nunless the United Nations system is placed on a sound\r\nfinancial footing. This is why we urge early action to solve\r\nthe acute financial crisis of the Organization.\r\nAll States, big and small, powerful and weak, learn\r\nthat power must be exercised responsibly. The big and\r\nstrong have a special role to play in a reformed United\r\nNations, particularly in the maintenance of peace. It is\r\nunrealistic not to recognize this. But the small and weak\r\nalso have their own vital contribution to make. Both must\r\nact responsibly and within both the letter and the spirit of\r\ninternational law.\r\nBarbados is confident that Member States can rise to\r\nthis collective challenge. The machinery is already in\r\nplace — in particular, the Open-ended High-level Working\r\nGroup on the strengthening of the United Nations system.\r\nBarbados will participate fully in this historic session.\r\nIt will work to revitalize and strengthen this unique\r\ninstitution, where humanity’s greatest hope for peace,\r\nsecurity, development and social justice resides. Together,\r\nwe can forge a renewed United Nations capable of fulfilling\r\nthe promise enshrined in “We the peoples”.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Culture, Youth and Sport of the Principality of\r\nLiechtenstein, Her Excellency Ms. Andrea Willi.\r\nMs. Willi (Liechtenstein): I should like to begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fiftieth session. At the\r\nsame time, I wish to thank your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy.\r\nWe are meeting this year at a crucial moment in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations. The fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Organization should be an occasion on which to\r\nreview the first half-century of the United Nations, but\r\nalso, first and foremost, to prepare the Organization for its\r\nfuture activities and to address the manifold challenges\r\nthat are ahead of us.\r\nWhile we commemorate the United Nations fiftieth\r\nanniversary, Liechtenstein is celebrating its fifth year of\r\nmembership in the Organization. When Liechtenstein was\r\nadmitted to the United Nations, the global situation was\r\nundergoing fundamental changes. People around the world\r\nhoped that the Organization would be able to work in a\r\ncomprehensive and more efficient way towards fulfilling\r\nthe purposes assigned to it under the Charter. Many of\r\nthese hopes have remained unfulfilled. The optimism that\r\nprevailed at the beginning of the post-cold-war era has\r\nturned into sometimes heavy criticism and a decreasing\r\nconfidence in the work of the United Nations. This\r\ncriticism is not always justified and is sometimes based\r\non a lack of understanding of the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations or, more often, on a one-sided approach\r\nto its activities.\r\nThe achievements of the Organization in the areas of\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance, the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights and the strengthening and\r\nfurther development of international law, to name only a\r\nfew, are unique and undeniable. However, it remains a\r\nfact that events of the recent past have undermined the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations in the eyes of many\r\npeople, and we have to make every effort to restore and\r\nenhance the confidence of the peoples that we represent.\r\nWe must only look back in order to make the best use of\r\nthe experience we have acquired over the past 50 years\r\nand to enable the Organization to respond effectively to\r\nthe new challenges it faces today.\r\nThe financial situation of the Organization is beyond\r\nany doubt one of the issues that need to be addressed\r\nurgently. After many years of serious financial problems,\r\nwe have reached a stage where the work of the United\r\nNations itself is in jeopardy. Drastic measures had to be\r\ntaken recently to guarantee the continuation of its daily\r\nwork. It is of the utmost importance, however, that no\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nmeasures be taken which affect the nature and the\r\nefficiency of United Nations activities, which are urgently\r\nneeded. The efforts to improve and to monitor the\r\nadministrative and management capabilities must be\r\ncontinued and further enhanced. All Member States have to\r\npay their assessed contributions fully and on time if a\r\ndurable solution to the current crisis is to be found. We are\r\nconfident that the Working Group that you, Mr. President,\r\nwill be chairing, will produce fruitful results.\r\nThe increasing financial burden that peace-keeping\r\noperations impose on national budgets must be alleviated.\r\nWe are of the opinion that a proliferation of peace-keeping\r\noperations has to be avoided, and I wish to emphasize that\r\nthe concept of preventive diplomacy deserves even more\r\nattention than it has received until now.\r\nIt is obvious that the world has changed. It is also\r\nobvious that the challenges for the United Nations have\r\nchanged. For these reasons, changes have to be made\r\nwithin the Organization in order to enable it to cope with\r\nthese challenges. We therefore support the efforts to reform,\r\nmodernize and restructure the United Nations and welcome\r\nthe process that has been initiated to that effect.\r\nMany people wrongly identify the United Nations only\r\nwith the activities of and the decisions taken by the\r\nSecurity Council. While we must work together in order to\r\npromote understanding and knowledge of other United\r\nNations activities, which are equally important, we also\r\nhave to understand that issues of international peace and\r\nsecurity directly or emotionally affect people all over the\r\nworld. We therefore have to make every effort to enhance\r\nthe effectiveness and the credibility of the work of the\r\nCouncil. A limited expansion of the permanent and non-\r\npermanent membership and improved working methods, as\r\nwell as enhanced transparency, would certainly make an\r\nimportant contribution in this respect. As a small country,\r\nwe follow the activities of the pertinent Working Group\r\nwith particular interest. We are of the view that the work\r\ndone so far has been very substantial. However, many of\r\nthe sensitive questions require further discussions.\r\nLiechtenstein, like many other countries, has to rely on\r\nthe universal respect for international law. The United\r\nNations has made remarkable contributions to the further\r\ndevelopment and strengthening of international law. The\r\nadoption of new legal instruments in important areas,\r\nhowever, sharply conflicts with continued and sometimes\r\nsystematic violations of international law, particularly in the\r\nfield of human rights, and of international humanitarian\r\nlaw. The establishment of the international ad hoc Tribunals\r\nfor the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda can prove to be an\r\nimportant element in preventing the recurrence of such\r\nviolations. It is essential that, for the first time since the\r\nTribunals of Nuremberg and of Tokyo, individuals be\r\nheld responsible for violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law. We hope that the work of these\r\nTribunals will be effective and will contribute to the early\r\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\r\nThe Liechtenstein Government welcomes the historic\r\ndecision to make the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) permanent. We have come one\r\nstep closer to the overall elimination of nuclear weapons,\r\nand we express our most fervent hope that the NPT will\r\nvery soon become universal. We therefore appeal to those\r\nStates which have not yet ratified the Treaty to do so\r\nurgently. We further express our hope that the next step\r\nwill be the early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear\r\ntest-ban treaty. Liechtenstein deplores the fact that nuclear\r\ntests are still going on and urges all nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to refrain from any further testing.\r\nOne of the most remarkable and uncontested merits\r\nof the United Nations in its first 50 years lies in the field\r\nof self-determination. While some people seem to think\r\nthat these activities of the Organization are a closed\r\nchapter that belongs to the past, others, including the\r\nGovernment of Liechtenstein, are of the view that the\r\npotential of the right to self-determination has not been\r\nexhausted and offers possibilities to cope with many\r\nconflict situations all over the world. We are convinced\r\nthat the right to self-determination deserves further\r\ndiscussion and development within the United Nations.\r\nLiechtenstein has therefore, within the framework of its\r\nnational activities for the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary, organized two international conferences this\r\nyear dedicated to this subject. We hope that we can\r\ncontinue to count on the Organization’s interest in this\r\nmatter, which is of crucial importance for the fulfilment\r\nof its purposes.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, which\r\nconcluded in Beijing three weeks ago, reaffirmed that the\r\nhuman rights of women and of the girl child are an\r\nintegral part of universal human rights. The Liechtenstein\r\nGovernment welcomes the fact that the Conference agreed\r\non a wide range of measures to remove the remaining\r\nobstacles to women’s full and equal participation in all\r\nspheres of life. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for\r\nAction contain a comprehensive plan for the international\r\ncommunity to promote the status of women, to the\r\nultimate benefit of society as a whole. It gives me\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\npleasure to announce that the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\r\nhas recently been submitted to the Liechtenstein Parliament\r\nfor approval.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary cannot be an occasion for self-\r\ncongratulation. However impressive the achievements,\r\nhowever disappointing the failures, one thing is certain:\r\nthere is no alternative to the United Nations, and all\r\nMember States have to work together to make the\r\nOrganization stronger and more efficient. The Government\r\nof Liechtenstein remains committed to this goal.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of External\r\nAffairs of the Gambia, His Excellency Mr. Baboucarr-\r\nBlaise I. Jagne.\r\nMr. Jagne (Gambia): Let me begin by congratulating\r\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. Our confidence in\r\nyour stewardship is further strengthened by your\r\ndistinguished career at home and, indeed, your\r\nunderstanding of international affairs. I should therefore like\r\nto assure you of my delegation’s full support and\r\ncooperation as you carry out your important mandate.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to your illustrious\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for a job well\r\ndone. Indeed, he has honoured his country and, by\r\nextension, the entire African continent by succeeding in\r\ngiving the presidency of the General Assembly a new\r\nimage.\r\nAs for the Secretary-General of the Organization,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, we can hardly thank him\r\nenough for his work, including the excellent arrangements\r\nmade for this session, which takes on particular importance\r\nthis year. The Secretary-General deserves commendation for\r\nall his commitment to development, social justice and\r\ninternational peace and security — objectives on the basis\r\nof which this Organization was founded.\r\nHaving said that, I should like to take this opportunity\r\nto welcome the one-hundred-eighty-fifth Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. Palau’s recent admission is a true reflection\r\nof the universality of the Organization.\r\nIt is regrettable, though, that it has not been possible\r\nto discuss the readmission of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan on the basis of the same principle. Considering its\r\npopulation of 21 million and the fact that it is one of the\r\nworld’s leading economies, my delegation sincerely\r\nbelieves that the Republic of China on Taiwan, readmitted\r\nas a full Member, would make significant contributions to\r\nthe work of the United Nations. It is hoped that such a\r\nmove would also facilitate the process of reunification.\r\nAbout the same time last year we informed this\r\nAssembly of the establishment of an Armed Forces\r\nProvisional Ruling Council and a new Government in the\r\nGambia, under the chairmanship of His Excellency\r\nCaptain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, following the military\r\ntakeover on 22 July 1994. The factors that compelled the\r\nArmy to take over the reins of power have already been\r\nexplained in sufficient detail. Prominent among the\r\nreasons was rampant corruption.\r\nIn this regard, let me inform the Assembly that the\r\nvarious commissions of inquiry established to probe the\r\nactivities of the former regime have so far made shocking\r\nrevelations about the degree of corruption and\r\nmismanagement that was the order of the day in the\r\nGambia during the last 30 years. The most devastating\r\nrevelation of all has been made by the Crude Oil\r\nCommission, which uncovered the embezzlement of\r\nmillions of dollars meant to finance development projects\r\nin the country.\r\nEqually breathtaking are the findings of the\r\nCommission concerning Government Departments and\r\nline Ministries. The work of the Public Assets and\r\nProperties Recovery Commission, also chaired by a\r\nSuperior Court Judge, is progressing steadily. Here again\r\nwhat has been unfolding leaves no reasonable doubt that\r\nthere was widespread abuse of public office under the\r\nprevious regime.\r\nMeanwhile, the Commission of Inquiry into Land\r\nAdministration is currently examining the evidence that it\r\nhas been gathering since its creation, and it will submit its\r\nreport soon. By all accounts, the findings so far of the\r\nCommission of Inquiry into the Financial Activities of\r\nPublic Corporations are also earth-moving.\r\nStrenuous efforts are being made to recover\r\neverything stolen. But the important thing is the lesson\r\ndrawn from all these Commissions, which, basically, is\r\nthat public office is essentially for the service of one’s\r\ncountry, and not to be used as a vehicle for self-\r\nenrichment. Even members of the general public are now\r\nmore responsive to their tax obligations, as evidenced by\r\nthe record tax collections since the setting up of the\r\nCommissions to which I have referred. More important,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nthe principles of accountability, transparency and probity in\r\npublic life are gradually taking root in Gambian society.\r\nAll these facts speak for themselves, and we now\r\nunderstand why the Gambia is poorer today than it was at\r\nthe time of independence. The country’s meagre resources,\r\nwhich should have been utilized for development purposes,\r\nwere grossly mismanaged — to say the least. This is why\r\nnot a single hospital or high school had been built after 30\r\nyears of independence. It was deliberate policy to keep our\r\npeople ignorant and, therefore, no serious attempt was made\r\nto build a television station or, at least, to improve the\r\nnational radio station so that it could be heard all over the\r\ncountry.\r\nCan this, in all honesty, be called democracy? And, to\r\nperpetuate themselves in power, the authorities of the\r\nformer regime brought in truck-loads of foreigners to vote\r\nfor them during elections. In the absence of an independent\r\nelectoral commission it was easy for them to indulge in\r\nsuch malpractice.\r\nThe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council\r\nGovernment has since adopted a Programme of\r\nRectification and Timetable for Transition to Democratic\r\nConstitutional Rule by July 1996. Mindful, however, of the\r\nfact that democracy and development are inextricably\r\nlinked, we have also drawn up a development agenda\r\nfocusing mainly on the social sectors. The two programmes,\r\ncontained in one document, were formally submitted to our\r\ntraditional partners-in-development for assistance. To our\r\ngreat surprise, however, and despite all the hullabaloo over\r\nthe need to speed up the democratization process, very little\r\nor no assistance at all was forthcoming to complement our\r\nnational efforts.\r\nDespite the fact that the Timetable was reduced from\r\nfour years to two years after nationwide consultation, the\r\nEuropean Union and its allies still maintain sanctions\r\nagainst the Government. None of the efforts made to\r\nimplement the various activities in the transition\r\nProgramme have been acknowledged by them. I am\r\nreferring to the Constitutional Review Commission, the\r\nCivic Education Programme, and the Electoral Law Review\r\nCommittee. Our traditional partners in development all\r\nreneged on their promises. This unfounded scepticism has\r\nnot deterred us from forging ahead with our plans to build\r\na new society. That is why we have decided to finance the\r\noperations of some of these activities to demonstrate our\r\ncommitment to the transition Programme.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAs a serious-minded Government we cannot abdicate\r\nour responsibility, or our duty, towards our people. It is\r\nfor that reason that two high schools and three junior\r\nsecondary schools are being built. They should be ready\r\nwithin the next few weeks.\r\nPlans are also well under way to build at least a\r\nthird referral hospital. In addition to the building of\r\nschools our national education policy is currently under\r\nreview with the aim of making education more accessible\r\nto all, notably to girls, and tailored to suit our national\r\ndevelopment objectives. Recently, too, we have embarked\r\non the building of a university. All these efforts clearly\r\ndemonstrate once more the importance attached to the\r\ndevelopment of human resources. This, we are convinced,\r\nwill rescue our people from the darkness of ignorance,\r\nilliteracy and deprivation.\r\nIn the area of infrastructural development, not only\r\nare roads being built, but His Excellency the Chairman of\r\nthe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council and Head\r\nof State recently laid the foundation-stone for the new\r\nBanjul International Airport complex. In fact, work has\r\ncommenced on this project, which is on a turn-key basis.\r\nAs agriculture is the backbone of the economy, the\r\nArmed Forces Provisional Ruling Council Government is\r\ngiving this sector all the attention that it deserves. That is\r\nin line with our thinking that a nation that cannot feed\r\nitself can hardly be called independent. A hungry nation\r\ncannot concentrate on nation-building. Besides, food is\r\nused as a weapon.\r\nIt is said that the youth of today are the future\r\nleaders of tomorrow. Guided by this adage and the\r\nprinciple of good citizenry, the Armed Forces Provisional\r\nRuling Council has introduced a National Youth Service\r\nScheme, the basic purpose of which is to inculcate\r\ndiscipline and to reorient the thinking of Gambian youth\r\ntowards nation-building while harnessing their potential\r\nfor future adult life. The first group of volunteers will be\r\nsworn in in the new year.\r\nIt may be said without fear of contradiction that\r\nGambians have now become more aware of their rights\r\nand duties and that for the first time in many years they\r\nface the future with renewed hope and confidence. On\r\nthat fateful Friday of 22 July 1994, His Excellency the\r\nChairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nCouncil, Captain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, woke a nation\r\nthat had been slumbering for 30 years with a new vision to\r\ntransform the Gambia into a highly developed model\r\ncountry. In this way the Government will have bequeathed\r\nto the present and future generations a legacy worthy of all\r\nthe sacrifices that are being made today.\r\nHistory teaches us that once in a while at some point\r\nin a country’s history a visionary leader will emerge with\r\na mission to transform that society for the better. We in the\r\nGambia are fortunate that in the hour of need, His\r\nExcellency Captain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, a soldier with\r\na difference, took centre stage, and now provides the\r\nquality of leadership commensurate with the challenges of\r\nthe times. Since the advent of the Armed Forces Provisional\r\nRuling Council to power under Chairman Jammeh’s\r\nguidance we have learned within a short period of time\r\nwhat effective leadership means, and have come to the\r\nconclusion that there is no gainsaying that a leadership with\r\nvision always has the nation’s interests at heart.\r\nSimilarly, at the international level when the world’s\r\nleadership is characterized by statesmen with a vision, the\r\ncollective interests of mankind always have primacy over\r\nother considerations emanating from narrow-minded\r\nnationalism. As great minds think alike, and as a bitter\r\nlesson had been learned from two world wars, the need was\r\nfelt to create the United Nations. It is interesting to note\r\nthat in the Preamble to the Charter we do not find the usual\r\nphrases that appear in other international legal instruments,\r\nsuch as “We the contracting parties” but instead we have\r\nthe words\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations”.\r\nThe concept of international solidarity and the unity of the\r\nhuman race immediately come into play with the expressed\r\ndetermination not only\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar”\r\nbut also\r\n“to employ international machinery for the promotion\r\nof the economic and social advancement of all\r\npeoples”.\r\nIt is in this spirit that my delegation views the World\r\nSummit for Social Development held in Copenhagen last\r\nMarch as a significant turning-point in the international\r\ncommunity’s persistent efforts to improve the quality of life\r\nof peoples all over the world. The Summit, including the\r\nnon-governmental organizations forum, facilitated a\r\nbroader exchange of views by the international\r\ncommunity on social development issues, with emphasis\r\non poverty alleviation, the generation of employment, and\r\nhealth care.\r\nThe adoption of the Copenhagen Declaration on\r\nSocial Development and Programme of Action conveys\r\nour collective concern over the world’s social ills and\r\nindeed the commitment to a concerted effort to find\r\nviable solutions to these problems.\r\nOf particular relevance to my delegation are the\r\ncommitments made by the said forum concerning the\r\nsocio-economic development of Africa, and of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries in particular, and the provision of the\r\nnecessary financial and other resources. These\r\ncommitments should serve as the basis for Africa’s\r\nsustained economic and social development.\r\nThe political will and resources necessary for the\r\neffective implementation of the Programme of Action of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development should be\r\ndemonstrated not only in the full application of the 20/20\r\ninitiative but also the channelling of substantial\r\ntechnological, scientific and other resources aimed at\r\nachieving our objectives.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women held in\r\nBeijing, which has just ended, highlighted gender equality\r\nand gender needs, including the participation of women\r\nin the economic and political decision-making process, the\r\nelimination of all forms of discrimination and violence\r\nagainst women, adequate recognition and support of the\r\ncontribution of women to the management of natural\r\nresources and the safeguarding of the environment.\r\nIndeed, as ably stated by the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations:\r\n“The empowerment of women is the empowerment\r\nof all humanity!” (Press Release SG/SM/5732)\r\nThe Platform for Action, which focuses on the role\r\nof women in development, should provide important\r\nguidelines for realizing the goals that we have set. In the\r\nGambia, women have been playing an indispensable role\r\nin national development. Today 4 out of 14 Ministers are\r\nwomen, responsible for important sectors such as health\r\nand social welfare, education, youth and sports, and\r\ntourism and culture. Our participation in the World\r\nConference with our First Lady as Head of Delegation\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nwas inspired by the Government’s commitment to women’s\r\nissues, including gender equality and the encouragement of\r\nwomen to participate in national development.\r\nIt goes without saying that women and children\r\nconstitute the most vulnerable group in society, and we will\r\nnot be doing justice to our children if we do not renew the\r\ncommitments made during the World Summit for Children\r\nand acknowledge the preponderant role played by the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in mapping out\r\nstrategies for the greater welfare of children all over the\r\nworld. We in the Gambia have made considerable progress\r\nin the implementation of the mid-term decade goals,\r\nnotably in the area of the Expanded Programme on\r\nImmunization.\r\nAt this juncture, my delegation would like to pay\r\ntribute to the memory of the late James P. Grant, the\r\nformer Executive Director of UNICEF, for his outstanding\r\nperformance in increasing international public awareness of\r\nthe plight of children and his total dedication to the cause\r\nof children the world over. It is our fervent hope that the\r\nnew Executive Director will build on the achievements of\r\nher predecessor.\r\nAn issue related to the question of women and\r\nchildren is population and development. It will be recalled\r\nthat at the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, held in Cairo in September 1994, far-\r\nreaching decisions were taken, as outlined in the\r\nProgramme of Action that was adopted. What is important\r\nhere is that what should be done at the national level should\r\nbe complemented by a concerted international effort, as\r\nagreed in Cairo.\r\nThe interrelationship between population and the\r\nenvironment cannot be overemphasized. In fact, in the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted at the International\r\nConference on Population and Development, it is stated that\r\n“Pressure on the environment may result from\r\nrapid population growth, distribution and migration,\r\nespecially in ecologically vulnerable ecosystems.\r\nUrbanization and policies that do not recognize the\r\nneed for rural development also create environmental\r\nproblems.” (A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1, annex, chapter III,\r\nsection C, para. 3.26)\r\nIn this regard, it is gratifying to note that following the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, it has\r\nbeen possible, under Agenda 21, to successfully conclude\r\nthe Convention to Combat Desertification in those\r\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa.\r\nIn the same vein, we are mindful of the needs of our\r\npeoples for better living standards and improvement of\r\nthe rural and urban environment through the provision of\r\nadequate shelter and sustainable human settlements. My\r\ndelegation therefore anxiously looks forward to the\r\nSecond United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\r\n(Habitat II), to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, in June next\r\nyear.\r\nAll these world conferences on various issues of\r\nconcern to the international community should be seen as\r\nour collective endeavour to give concrete expression to\r\nthe pledge enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations\r\n“to promote social progress and better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom”.\r\nIn pursuit of these objectives, we should also be\r\nstrengthened in our resolve, as also stated in the Charter,\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\r\nand small”.\r\nThis leads me to recall the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, held in Vienna a few years ago. We in the\r\nGambia have always maintained that human rights should\r\nnot be viewed only from the narrow perspective of civil\r\nand political rights, but also from the perspective of the\r\nright to development. In the Gambia, over the last 30\r\nyears, we have had the experience of elections being held\r\nat regular intervals, but we all know that it was only a\r\nfacade.\r\nThere is no point in overemphasizing civil and\r\npolitical rights in a developing country at the expense of\r\nmore pressing needs in other areas, such as health,\r\neducation and agriculture. Before people can think of\r\ncasting a vote they first of all want to make sure that they\r\nhave enough food to eat, can send their children to school\r\nand have access to health care. In any case, let there be\r\nno illusion about this, for democracy cannot flourish\r\nunder conditions of abject poverty.\r\nThe greatest threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity today is the ever widening gap between rich and\r\npoor. And since we live in a world of interdependence,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nthe North-South dialogue that has been dormant for so long\r\nneeds to be revived urgently to put the emphasis on the\r\neconomic development of third world countries.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIt is true that the world economic situation has\r\nregistered notable improvements in the economies both of\r\nindustrialized and of some developing countries. It is to be\r\nnoted, however, that the various growth rates in different\r\ndeveloping countries reflect their limitations and lack of\r\nadequate incentives and resources.\r\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round is expected to\r\ngenerate an increase in merchandise trade of 12 per cent by\r\nthe year 2005. As far as developing countries are\r\nconcerned, however, any benefits to be derived from this\r\nagreement would depend largely on their accessibility to\r\nmarkets through the removal, of course, of tariff as well as\r\nnon-tariff barriers.\r\nIt is feared, though, that in the case of sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica any gains from the Uruguay Round will be seriously\r\nlimited by the low proportion of manufactured goods in its\r\nexports. The case is even more serious for least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council’s high-level meeting\r\non the development of Africa within the context of the\r\nreview of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the l990s, held from 4 to 6 July\r\n1995 in Geneva, was indeed very timely. None the less, the\r\nmapping out of all these strategies for development will\r\nhave little meaning unless they are matched by the\r\nnecessary resources to achieve the desired results, especially\r\nwhen the resources generated through structural adjustment\r\nare paradoxically diverted to service our debts. And we\r\nknow that it is indeed an excruciating burden.\r\nAll these issues have been adequately addressed in the\r\nUnited Nations Agenda for Development. In the Agenda for\r\nPeace, however, there is still the need for greater efforts to\r\nfind solutions to the various protracted conflicts around the\r\nworld. There have been a lot of criticisms and reservations\r\npertaining to peace-keeping operations — notably with\r\nregard to the huge costs involved — but peace is priceless.\r\nWhat has happened to the peace dividend, anyway,\r\nwhich was talked about so much during previous sessions\r\nof the General Assembly? The head of the Australian\r\ndelegation made some interesting proposals regarding the\r\nfinancing of peace-keeping operations. There is a lot of\r\nsense and merit to what he said, and we should be doing\r\njustice to ourselves if these proposals were considered\r\nseriously. We must never relent in our collective\r\nendeavour to find lasting solutions to all the conflicts\r\nbesetting the international community, whether in\r\nSomalia, Rwanda, Burundi or Afghanistan, to name a\r\nfew.\r\nIn our subregion, we welcome the signing of the\r\nPeace Agreement by all the warring factions in the\r\nLiberian civil war and the establishment of Council of\r\nState to oversee the transition to a democratic, freely\r\nelected civilian Government. It is our fervent hope that\r\nthe cease-fire will hold so that the people of Liberia will\r\nonce again live in the environment of peace and stability\r\nthat has been denied them for so long. Let me take this\r\nopportunity to commend the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) for its timely initiative\r\nand persistent endeavour to finally put together this\r\nimportant peace package. This clearly demonstrates that\r\nregional arrangements, as stipulated in Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, could play a preponderant\r\nrole in conflict resolution.\r\nWe have been following with great attention the\r\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process, and my\r\ndelegation would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate both Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization (PLO) on these achievements and to\r\nencourage them to maintain the same commitment in the\r\nquest for a just and lasting peace.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, my delegation notes with cautious optimism\r\nthe recent peace deal between the parties concerned. It\r\nwould not have been possible, however to bring the Serb\r\naggressors to the negotiating table without the limited use\r\nof force against them.\r\nThe situation in Jammu and Kashmir has also been\r\nof concern to my delegation. We therefore urge all the\r\nparties to the conflict to try to resolve this long-running\r\ndispute through dialogue.\r\nWe in the Gambia have always maintained that we\r\nwill never condone the use of force by a bigger Power to\r\nimpose its will on a smaller country. I am referring to the\r\nlingering problems resulting from the Iraqi invasion of\r\nKuwait, such as the question of prisoners of war, payment\r\nof reparations and, indeed, the return to Kuwait of all\r\nproperties taken away during the invasion. In short, Iraq\r\nshould comply with all Security Council resolutions.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nMeanwhile, though, ways and means should be found to\r\nease the suffering of the innocent Iraqi civilian populations.\r\nFifty years is a relatively short period in the life of an\r\ninternational organization such as the United Nations, but\r\nit has been a period full of important and eventful activities,\r\nwith successes and setbacks.\r\nFor 50 years now the United Nations has been\r\nworking for global development and the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Its Charter has become the\r\nlegal and moral foundation of international relations.\r\nThrough the United Nations we have witnessed the\r\nproclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, the enactment of the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea, the holding of global conferences on the environment,\r\ndevelopment, population, children, women, and soon, on\r\nhuman settlements.\r\nThe United Nations should be commended primarily\r\nfor the broader role it played during the cold-war period\r\nand for championing the concerns and interests of\r\ndeveloping countries. It has always provided a platform\r\nwhere big and small nations meet and discuss issues of\r\ncommon concern.\r\nAt this juncture, when we are celebrating the golden\r\njubilee of the United Nations, my delegation believes that\r\nthe time could not be more propitious to lift the economic\r\nblockade against Cuba. This dynamic island nation has\r\nmade remarkable progress in the area of medicine and\r\ngenetic engineering, achievements that Cuba would share\r\nwith the rest of the international community.\r\nAs a small developing country confronted with unique\r\nchallenges, the Gambia is keen to ensure that the ongoing\r\nreforms aimed at restructuring and revitalizing the United\r\nNations remain on course. The strengthening of the role of\r\nthe General Assembly and the office of its President as well\r\nas the improvement in the performance of the Secretariat\r\nshould be commended. Any reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem should emphasize the need for more coordination\r\nbetween agencies and the development of new procedures\r\nfor the accelerated implementation of programmes and\r\nactivities.\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations today will\r\ncontinue well into the twenty-first century. In this\r\nconnection it is imperative to restructure the composition of\r\nthe Security Council as soon as possible to reflect the\r\nrealities of today and in that restructuring Africa’s interest\r\nmust be taken into account. In other words, Africa must\r\nbe represented permanently on the Security Council.\r\nLet me conclude by renewing the Gambia’s\r\ncommitment to the ideals of the United Nations. The\r\nOrganization is far from being perfect, but, at the same\r\ntime, we do recognize that it is indispensable, for it is the\r\nrepository of the hopes and aspirations of mankind.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Minister\r\nof State for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican Republic,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Manuel Trullols.\r\nMr. Trullols (Dominican Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): May I first of all on behalf of the\r\nDominican Republic and on behalf of its Constitutional\r\nPresident, Mr. Joaquín Balaguer, express our sincerest\r\ncongratulations to the President of the fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nSecondly, I wish to express our profound gratitude\r\nto the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, who\r\npresided over the forty-ninth session and, particularly, to\r\nthe Secretary-General, who, by his extraordinary efforts\r\nand tireless dedication in a world marked by challenges\r\nand breaches of the peace, wages a daily combat for the\r\nfull implementation of the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe Dominican Republic can affirm with pride on\r\nthis fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United\r\nNations its role as a founding Member of the United\r\nNations, which signed the San Francisco Charter within\r\nthe international order that rose from the ashes of the\r\nSecond World War, whose fiftieth anniversary we also\r\ncommemorate, and as a country that defends the principle\r\nof sovereignty as the inalienable right of the people.\r\nFifty years after the creation of the United Nations\r\nin 1945, the world is in a state of transition toward what\r\nhas been termed a new world order, moving from\r\nbipolarity to unipolarity in a multipolar world, following\r\nupon the world built in Yalta and in the Bretton Woods\r\nagreements.\r\nThe 1945 order was based on a balance of power\r\nand on the United Nations as a reflection of the real\r\ndesire to seek security and universal peace — and the\r\nOrganization has managed, since its creation, to avert\r\nanother nuclear holocaust.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nSmall countries such as the Dominican Republic,\r\nstaunch guardians of their national sovereignty, have\r\nwitnessed during the five decades since 1945 this order\r\ncreated through the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, with Bretton Woods, the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO), the Council for Economic Aid\r\n(COMECON), the Warsaw Pact, and the European\r\nEconomic Community — today the European Union; the\r\nevolution of countries with market economies and those\r\nwith centrally planned economies, and the decolonization\r\nprocesses which have resulted in the establishment of many\r\nindependent States. All this has left an indelible imprint on\r\nthe annals of contemporary history and has been rich in\r\nlessons for all the nations of the world — lessons, in a\r\nword, on relations between North and South.\r\nThe order which emerged from Bretton Woods was\r\nreflected in the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development\r\n(IBRD); and the aborted International Trade Organization\r\nof 1947, which was replaced by the General Agreement on\r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT), from which the agricultural\r\nsector, services and intellectual property were excluded. All\r\nthis explains why 46 years later, with the Uruguay Round\r\nof Multilateral Trade Negotiations and the birth, in 1993, of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), we are giving\r\nmultilateral shape to world trade in order to overcome\r\nbilateral barriers and, above all, the protectionism that was\r\npractised by the industrial countries.\r\nIn these five decades, the small countries had to\r\nstruggle mightily to uphold the principles of democracy,\r\nincluding respect for human rights, and to defend their right\r\nto access to the markets of the industrialized countries\r\nagainst tariff and non-tariff barriers, quotas, and downward\r\nspiralling in the prices of their raw materials. We can,\r\nhowever, point with pride to the way we fought for our\r\ndemands for greater symmetry and fairness in commercial\r\nand economic relations. This in the end led to the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development (UNCTAD).\r\nThe San Francisco Charter illuminated like a\r\npowerful beacon the road to the future of the countries that\r\nhad had to experience the difficult period of the bipolar\r\nworld. For its part, the Dominican Republic, committed as\r\nalways to the principles of the Charter, was able to attain\r\nthe functional democracy we enjoy today. This took place\r\nwithin a world that has some 30 integration processes and\r\nhas seen the emergence of three strong economic-\r\nintegration blocs with their spheres of influence — such as\r\nthe European Union and the North American Free Trade\r\nAgreement (NAFTA) — in addition to the Free Trade\r\nZone of the Americas, which will probably be established\r\nin the year 2005; and, for Eastern Asia, the Asia-Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC). There are also\r\nthe political repercussions these processes have had on a\r\nworld where the dreams for centrally planned economies\r\nhave faded. Our country is now a member of the recently\r\nestablished Association of Caribbean States (ACS).\r\nThis new world order that has now become the\r\nglobal village foreseen by Marshall McLuhan, within a\r\nglobalized, international economy, will not be without\r\ntensions, for we do not yet fully grasp the cultural\r\nplurality of nations and the strong search for identity in\r\nregions and within ethnic and religious groups. Contrary\r\nto the popular phrase, history has not come to an end. A\r\nnew process is beginning with the expression by peoples\r\nand regions of their national identity.\r\nThe globalization of trade would seem to transcend\r\nthe borders of the nation-State and create a concept of a\r\nregion-State, given the fragmentation of national\r\naggregate assets.\r\nWithin the family of nations we feel proud to have\r\nbeen not only one of the 51 States that participated in the\r\nSan Francisco Conference, but also one of the first to\r\nhave ratified, in resolution 962 of our National Congress,\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, which was promulgated\r\nby our Executive Branch on 11 August 1945.\r\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of that memorable date\r\nwe wish to pay tribute to those members of the\r\nDominican delegation who signed that historic document:\r\nManuel Peña Batlle, Emilio García Godoy, Gilberto\r\nSánchez Lustrino, Tulio Franco y Franco and Minerva\r\nBernardino. We are a nation deeply committed to the\r\nproper functioning of democratic institutions, having\r\nattained a commendable political stability in our\r\ncontinent’s community of nations.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations will be making a\r\npraiseworthy contribution to the process of maintaining\r\nstability in our country by responding to the request of\r\nthe Dominican Republic for reimbursement of the funds\r\nspent in implementing the economic embargo imposed on\r\nour neighbour, Haiti. The Dominican Republic has\r\nsubmitted that request to the Secretariat and our\r\nGovernment is now awaiting a response.\r\nAs a developing country the Dominican Republic\r\nmust face many challenges in the sensitive areas of drug\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\ntrafficking and drug consumption. This is a problem our\r\ncountry has met with a State policy that provides for severe\r\npunishments for offences related to this crime against\r\nhumanity. At the present time legislation is pending in our\r\nNational Congress to punish money-laundering, which is an\r\nactivity related to the criminal drug traffic. We are also\r\ncoordinating our policies with the international community,\r\nsince in this field more than any other international\r\ncooperation is required.\r\nIt is fitting here to congratulate the United Nations\r\nSecretariat on the successful holding of the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women at Beijing. That Conference\r\nrepresents a milestone in the Organization’s history because\r\nof the recognition it has granted to that noble human being\r\nwho makes up half of all humanity and is the mother of the\r\nother half.\r\nIn that connection we would reiterate at this fiftieth\r\nsession, just as we did at the last session, our concern at the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to merge the International\r\nResearch and Training Institute for the Advancement of\r\nWomen (INSTRAW) with the United Nations Development\r\nFund for Women (UNIFEM). The General Assembly\r\nshould recall Economic and Social Council resolution\r\n1979/4 of 9 May 1979, which established the permanent\r\nheadquarters of the Institute in the Dominican Republic.\r\nWe wish to reiterate — with the utmost courtesy, but\r\nalso with the utmost firmness — our request that\r\nINSTRAW and UNIFEM not be merged, maintaining the\r\ncommitments contained in General Assembly resolution\r\n34/157 of 17 December 1979 and the agreement that\r\nestablished INSTRAW in Santo Domingo so that our first\r\ncity of America may remain the headquarters of that\r\nimportant Institute. This would also be in keeping with the\r\nextraordinary importance of the recently concluded\r\nConference on Women.\r\nWe are now only six years from the beginning of the\r\ntwenty-first century, in the year 2001, and our thoughts turn\r\nto an assessment of the past 50 years since the founding of\r\nthe United Nations. We should also be visualizing the\r\nfoundations and the shape of the new world order for the\r\nbuilding of a future based on security and world peace.\r\nThis will require a qualitative change in the United Nations,\r\nremoving the sacrosanct aura surrounding the veto power of\r\nthe great Powers in the Security Council and promoting a\r\ndemocratic system of coexistence among States and\r\npeoples.\r\nThe United Nations and we, its Member States, will\r\nhave to meet the challenge of the demographic or so-\r\ncalled population bomb with growth estimated at 84\r\nmillion persons per year, and related problems, such as\r\nthe fact that in 1990 only 40 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation lived in rural sectors and over 50 per cent in\r\nurban centres of over 100,000 inhabitants. The number of\r\npersons suffering malnutrition is estimated to reach 512\r\nmillion by the end of the century. Children without\r\nschooling will number 315 million, and there will be 889\r\nmillion illiterate persons. Those living without sanitation\r\nsystems will reach 1,750 million. Dealing with those\r\nproblems will be a real challenge.\r\nThe new context of the world order will require a\r\nthree-pronged approach involving an ecological response,\r\na political response and an economic response.\r\nAlthough the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme was an important step forward for the\r\nprotection of the biosphere, consideration should be given\r\nthe possibility of creating, after proper study, an\r\necological response embodied in a United Nations\r\nenvironmental security council composed of Member\r\nStates with a permanent 15-member executive committee\r\nand a secretary-general with executive powers.\r\nThe political response would come from the reform\r\nof the United Nations Charter. In this connection, we\r\nshould bear in mind that Article 109 of the Charter,\r\nwhich was written in 1945, provides for the convening of\r\na General Conference within a 10-year period for the\r\npurpose of reviewing the Charter. In addition, on 22 April\r\n1991 a number of former Heads of State and political\r\nleaders appealed for a renewal of the United Nations.\r\nToday, it is appropriate to envisage the inclusion of\r\nGermany, Japan and India as members of the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as the inclusion of representatives of\r\nthird-world countries.\r\nCharter reform would, of course, imply the exercise\r\nof the powers of the Secretary-General supported by\r\nunder-secretaries for environmental, political and\r\neconomic affairs.\r\nIn addition, the economic response should come\r\nfrom a clear and precise definition of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations within the new order. Since, in the\r\neconomic sphere, the Group of 7 has already been\r\ncoordinating its policies through a kind of security\r\ncouncil, with the recent addition of Russia, we might\r\nenvisage its incorporation into the United Nations as a\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\r\nsort of Economic Council that might include, in addition,\r\nthe countries of southern Asia and the Pacific, as well as\r\nLatin America and other regions. It could eventually\r\nbecome a Group of 18, linked to the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, the specialized agencies and\r\nthe regional commissions.\r\nThe Dominican Republic hopes that the ideas and\r\nsuggestions that have been put forward, many now under\r\nstudy and being proposed in various forums, will be viewed\r\nas a good-will contribution by a small nation — a nation\r\nthat is small but proud of its participation in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nFor that reason, we cannot, as a small nation that\r\nbelieves in unity within diversity, fail to mention our\r\nsupport for the agenda item — proposed by Burkina Faso,\r\nCosta Rica, Dominica, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea-\r\nBissau, the Solomon Islands, Nicaragua, Niger, Panama,\r\nthe Central American Republic, Saint Lucia, Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines, Swaziland and our country,\r\nthe Dominican Republic — regarding the special situation\r\nof the Republic of China in Taiwan in the international\r\ncontext, based on the principle of universality and in\r\naccordance with the established model of parallel\r\nrepresentation of divided countries in the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan, a Founding\r\nMember of the United Nations, has a population of\r\n21 million, a high level of economic development and full\r\npolitical democracy. It has been a model to all developing\r\nnations. Its aspiration to participate in the United Nations\r\nonce again is something positive for the international\r\ncommunity. The Organization must not ignore its\r\nexistence. The Dominican Republic supports the\r\nestablishment of an ad hoc committee to seek a\r\nsatisfactory resolution of this matter.\r\nAt this fiftieth session, the General Assembly should\r\ntake stock of the achievements of the United Nations in\r\nits 50 years of existence as well as of the unfulfilled\r\nobjectives in the area of the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. But above all it should adopt a vision\r\nof the future that will enable us to build a democratic\r\nsystem of coexistence among States and peoples, inspired\r\nby the profound human aspiration to lasting peace. May\r\nmerciful God help us attain these goals.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.\r\n19\r\n"
