(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nEarthquake in Indonesia\r\nThe President: I should like, on behalf of all the\r\nMembers of the General Assembly, to extend deepest\r\nsympathy to the Government and people of Indonesia on\r\nthe tragic loss of lives and the extensive material damage\r\nresulting from the recent earthquake. May I also express the\r\nhope that the international community will show its\r\nsolidarity and will respond promptly and generously to any\r\nrequest for help.\r\nI call on the representative of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Poernomo (Indonesia): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Indonesia I should like to\r\nexpress my sincere appreciation and profound gratitude for\r\nthe words of sympathy and sorrow just expressed by you,\r\nMr. President.\r\nAccording to reports that we have received from\r\nIndonesia, more than 100 people have died and 2000 have\r\nbeen injured, 10,000 homes or buildings have been\r\ndestroyed, and the material destruction is yet to be\r\ndetermined.\r\nI will convey the sentiments of condolence to the\r\nmembers of the bereaved families, and once again I thank\r\nyou, Mr. President, for the sympathy and condolences you\r\nexpressed, on behalf of the Assembly, in regard to this\r\nnatural disaster.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Jules Rattankoemar Ajodhia,\r\nVice-President of the Republic of Suriname\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear a\r\nstatement by the Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nSuriname.\r\nMr. Jules Rattankoemar Ajodhia, Vice-President of\r\nthe Republic of Suriname, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Vice-President of the Republic of Suriname, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jules Ajodhia, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ajodhia (Suriname): We were deeply shocked\r\nwhen we heard about the earthquake that took place last\r\nnight in the Republic of Indonesia. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Suriname I offer our deepest\r\nsympathy to the victims and their families on this sad\r\noccasion.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, may I first warmly congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous and well-deserved election\r\nto the presidency of the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations. We have no doubt that\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nunder your distinguished leadership and with your\r\nexperience this session will achieve its aims. As you\r\npreside over our deliberations at this crucial juncture in\r\nhistory, you can be assured of our wholehearted cooperation\r\nas you fulfil your task.\r\nPermit me also to express our gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for the very\r\nable and competent manner in which he presided over the\r\nforty-ninth session.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to express our deep\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, for the exemplary manner in which he is fulfilling\r\nhis tasks during these challenging times. He deserves our\r\nadmiration and gratitude for the important role he plays in\r\nguiding this unique world Organization.\r\nI am especially pleased and honoured to greet Palau as\r\na new Member of the United Nations family. Suriname is\r\nlooking forward to close cooperation with this friendly\r\nnation in our common efforts to attain the noble goals of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nBefore I continue, I should like to express the feelings\r\nof sincere sympathy of the Government and people of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname for the Governments and peoples of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica,\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, and other territories in\r\nthe Caribbean for the great destruction sadly caused by\r\nHurricanes Luis and Marilyn.\r\nWe are living in an era in which the ending of the\r\ncold war has removed the risk of a nuclear nightmare and\r\nhas given us hope that a new atmosphere of cooperation\r\nbetween States will emerge. If we could show the necessary\r\npolitical will, this new atmosphere should provide us, now\r\nand in the coming decades, with a unique opportunity to\r\nfocus our attention on the solution of many problems,\r\nproblems which pose serious threats to international peace\r\nand security and which hamper efforts to achieve sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nIn some instances the international community has\r\nmade good use of these changing circumstances and has\r\nfound common approaches to problems affecting us all.\r\nExperience during the last few years, however, has revealed\r\nthat our world is still characterized by unfairness and\r\ninjustice, and that the gap between the developed countries\r\nand the majority of developing countries is widening. As a\r\nresult the number of countries in crisis or in near crisis is\r\nincreasing. Consequently, political instability, an increase in\r\nextreme poverty, social exclusion and social disintegration\r\nare on the rise in many developing countries, causing\r\ndespair and endangering peace and security both\r\nnationally and internationally.\r\nThe developing world has on many occasions\r\nunderlined the need to pay particular attention to the\r\nelimination of the ever-widening gap between the\r\ncountries of the North and those of the South and to the\r\nestablishment of a new equitable and just international\r\neconomic order.\r\nDuring several specifically focused international\r\nconferences organized by the United Nations, an appeal\r\nhas been made to the developed countries to fulfil their\r\nobligations to meet official development assistance targets\r\nand to help to create an international economic and\r\npolitical climate conducive to sustained economic growth\r\nin developing countries.\r\nUnfortunately, the response to our appeal has not\r\nfully met our expectations. It will therefore remain our\r\npriority to continue with concerted efforts to convince our\r\ndeveloped partners that honouring their commitments and\r\ncreating favourable economic conditions are also in their\r\nown interest, because there will be no durable peace and\r\nstability in the world as long as the majority of the\r\nworld’s population cannot fulfil its basic needs.\r\nAnother disturbing event on the present international\r\nscene is the eruption and spread of many serious violent\r\nconflicts and the increasing danger to international peace\r\nand security which these conflicts harbour. Such is the\r\ncase as we witness the prolonged violent action in former\r\nYugoslavia. These conflicts are the cause of terrible\r\ntragedy, as is evidenced by the extermination of tens of\r\nthousands of people, the casualties suffered by the civilian\r\npopulation, the destruction of the economic and social\r\ninfrastructure, the displacement of people from their\r\nhomes, and the lack of shelter, food and medical\r\nfacilities. Finding a solution to these conflicts which will\r\nserve the common interests of all parties involved will\r\nremain a major challenge for the United Nations.\r\nA few days ago the warring parties in the former\r\nYugoslavia signed an agreement which we hope will\r\nsignal the beginning of the end of the tragic war being\r\nwaged in that area. We appeal in the strongest terms to\r\nall parties involved to take advantage of this momentum\r\nand engage in meaningful negotiations in order to reach\r\na peaceful settlement which will silence the guns now and\r\nfor all time.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nIn Mozambique, Angola and, recently, Palestine we\r\nhave found proof that seemingly sworn enemies can resolve\r\ntheir differences through peaceful means. The Government\r\nof Suriname is therefore very pleased with the recently\r\nconcluded accord between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and commends both for\r\ntheir efforts to restore peace in the Middle East. We know\r\nthat the healing process will be slow and that there are\r\nmany obstacles to overcome, but we are sure that peace\r\nwill finally prevail over violence, chaos and misery.\r\nThe accelerated globalization of the world economy,\r\ndynamized by a technological revolution during the course\r\nof the last decade, has led to important changes in\r\nproduction structures and world trade. These changes affect\r\nthe terms of trade of many developing countries.\r\nOther developments, such as the successful conclusion\r\nof the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and\r\nthe emergence of mega-trading blocs and free trade zones,\r\nhave led to changes in the political and economic thinking\r\nin our region in the search for new ways of adapting to\r\nthese shifting circumstances. The recent formation of the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States and the decision by the\r\ncountries of the Western hemisphere to create a continental\r\nfree-trade zone by the year 2005 can be seen as proof of a\r\nvery strong commitment to regional cooperation by our\r\nrespective Governments.\r\nTo further our commitment to regional cooperation,\r\nthe Government of Suriname took two steps of historic\r\nsignificance: Suriname became the fourteenth member State\r\nof the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in July and was\r\na co-founder of the Association of Caribbean States.\r\nSuriname is ready to make its contribution in these regional\r\nbodies in order to attain economic prosperity for its people\r\nand to preserve and strengthen its democratic traditions and\r\nvalues.\r\nJust a few years ago, at the Rio Conference, we, the\r\nMember countries of the United Nations, established as a\r\nprimary concern the need to ensure a rational balance\r\nbetween realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding\r\nthe well-being of future generations through the protection\r\nof the world’s natural resources. Furthermore, we promoted\r\nthe awareness that development must be sustainable and\r\nthat sustainability requires due attention to both\r\nenvironmental and economic and social factors. The need\r\nto achieve economic development on terms compatible with\r\nthe conservation of the environment is a priority objective\r\nfor my country.\r\nSuriname is blessed with an impressive, rich tropical\r\nrain forest covering approximately 80 per cent of its total\r\nterritory. This makes our forest one of the main natural\r\nresources for fostering development and guaranteeing\r\nwelfare and prosperity for our people. Hence, the\r\nexploitation and alternative uses of the forest have always\r\nbeen among our primary economic activities.\r\nMy Government promotes sustainable management\r\nof the forest, which allows for its economic utilization,\r\nbut at the same time our primary concern is to ensure a\r\nrational balance between our legitimate socio-economic\r\ngoals and the protection of the health and well-being of\r\nfuture generations. Within our limited technological\r\ncapabilities, we are trying to fulfil our obligations to\r\npreserve the biological wealth of the forest.\r\nOur responsibility and commitment in this area are\r\nreflected in my Government’s policy of stringent\r\nprotection for approximately 1 million hectares of forest.\r\nThis is accomplished through the creation of 13 nature\r\nreserves and one national park and through additional\r\nplans to add half a million hectares of forest to the nature\r\nreserves in the short term. Hence, in the near future, 10\r\nper cent of all Surinamese territory will be protected.\r\nAnother important step taken by the Government in\r\nthe sphere of sustainable use of the forest, guaranteeing\r\nthe preservation of biodiversity, is evidenced by the\r\nNational Assembly’s ratification in July 1995, of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.\r\nFurthermore, the results of the recently concluded\r\nnegotiations with potential investors will be submitted to\r\nour National Assembly for approval. In accordance with\r\nthe agreements reached, our forest will be exploited only\r\naccording to the so-called Celos management system, as\r\ndeveloped in Suriname and accepted internationally as the\r\nbest form of forest management.\r\nI should not fail to share with the Assembly our\r\nconcerns over the problem of illicit traffic in drugs,\r\nespecially since we, unfortunately, as a transit country,\r\nhave attracted much of this unlawful and damaging trade\r\nas a consequence of our service economy, the present\r\nfinancial and economic crisis and our geographical\r\nsituation.\r\nIllicit traffic in drugs poses special security problems\r\nfor countries like ours, with hundreds of miles of\r\nunguarded shorelines and inadequate resources to match\r\nthe super-modern equipment to which drug traffickers\r\nhave access. Because of its operational methods, which\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nhave no regard for frontiers, this form of modern\r\naggression has become one of the most serious types of\r\ninternational crime. It must be combated in all its various\r\nphases and manifestations.\r\nRecent drug enforcement operations in our region have\r\nshown that firm action in the struggle against drug\r\ntrafficking at the national level can be successful and that\r\nwith concerted action it is possible to break up the main\r\nnetworks of drug traffickers. Indeed, this success stands out\r\nas a ray of optimism and hope, overcoming the temptation\r\nto yield to discouragement and pessimism in this area.\r\nUnfortunately, it is not enough for one country or a\r\nfew countries to be victorious because drug trafficking is an\r\ninternational crime which threatens mankind in every corner\r\nof the world. It is capable of offsetting the efforts of\r\nGovernments to eradicate this scourge. Moreover, it is\r\nlinked to activities such as arms trafficking and terrorism,\r\nwhile its repercussions are no longer merely social and\r\neconomic but pose serious threats to political and social\r\nstability. However, to eradicate this multifaceted scourge\r\nonce and for all, we need — now more than ever —\r\nenhanced regional and international cooperation that is\r\neffective and constructive and that complements the efforts\r\nof individual countries.\r\nMy country will persist in the struggle against illicit\r\ndrug trafficking because this struggle represents a moral\r\ncommitment, not only to the Surinamese people but to all\r\npeople, especially to the children and young people,\r\naffected by this scourge.\r\nThe experience gained by the Government of\r\nSuriname in the field of development cooperation reveals\r\nthe supportive role of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund,\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Fund for Women and other agencies in the\r\ndevelopment efforts of Suriname.\r\nRecently, our per capita income and the adjustment of\r\nthe indicative planning figure for 1995 and 1996 were\r\nrevised by UNDP. That revision offered us substantive\r\nadditional support for the implementation of activities\r\nplanned within the framework of the national development\r\nstrategy, in particular effective activities related to the\r\nstructural adjustment programme, the public sector reform\r\nprogramme and the regional integration programme.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Suriname,\r\nwe would like to express our gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for their efforts to\r\npromote greater involvement of the United Nations in\r\nfostering development in Suriname. We are looking\r\nforward to the continuation and enhancement of closer\r\ncooperation with the operational arms of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nSuriname is aware of the need to make the United\r\nNations an effective instrument for the international\r\ncommunity in the quest for sustainable development and\r\ndurable international peace and security.To this end, the\r\nfinances of this world body should be streamlined but,\r\nabove all, the restructuring efforts should reflect today’s\r\ninternational economic and political realities. In this\r\nregard, Suriname favours the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil as regards both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers. The increase in the number of permanent\r\nmembers should not however involve developed countries\r\nonly. Hence we support expansion through the inclusion\r\nof permanent members selected also from developing\r\ncountries which are able to contribute to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security and which have\r\nalready expressed their desire to become permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\nSuriname became the 144th Member of the United\r\nNations family in November 1975. This year we will\r\ncelebrate the twentieth anniversary of our independence\r\nand also the twentieth anniversary of our membership of\r\nthis world body. Twenty years of experience as an\r\nindependent nation and as a Member of the United\r\nNations have revealed to us that the principles enshrined\r\nin the Charter still remain the cornerstone in relations\r\nbetween States.\r\nMy country has therefore on various occasions\r\npledged its commitment to the observance of these\r\nprinciples. In the past, even before we gained\r\nindependence, citizens from Suriname were called upon\r\nto defend these principles — in some cases, regrettably,\r\nwith their lives. Today, on behalf of the Government and\r\npeople of Suriname, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, I would like to acknowledge the\r\nvaluable contribution that these brave men and women\r\nhave made to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAt present, Suriname is part of the efforts by the\r\ninternational community, through the United Nations, to\r\nrestore order and democracy and to foster prosperity in\r\nHaiti.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nWhen called upon to do so, Suriname will always\r\ncontribute, through the United Nations, to the endeavours\r\nof the international community to make our world a better\r\nplace in which to live.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI thank the Vice-President of the Republic of Suriname for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jules Rattankoemar Ajodhia, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Burkina Faso, His Excellency Mr.\r\nAblassé Ouédraogo.\r\nMr. Ouédraogo (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On behalf of the Government and the people of\r\nBurkina Faso, permit me to convey to you, Mr. President,\r\nmy sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election\r\nto the presidency of this historic session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nYour country, Portugal, has ties of friendship and\r\ncooperation with my own, based on the noble ideals of the\r\nCharter, and it has always worked to promote friendship\r\nand solidarity among peoples. Your election is therefore a\r\nrecognition of your personal skills and qualities and also a\r\nwell-deserved tribute to your country. I am certain that the\r\nother members of the Bureau will place their recognized\r\nskills at your disposal so that, together, you may guide the\r\nwork of this session successfully.\r\nI wish also to convey our warmest congratulations and\r\ngratitude to my brother and friend, Foreign Minister Amara\r\nEssy, of Côte d’Ivoire, for the remarkable work he did as\r\nPresident at the forty-ninth session. With his tact and\r\ndiscretion he gave a tremendous impetus to the work of our\r\nOrganization throughout the year.\r\nLastly, let me once again pay a well-deserved tribute\r\nto our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who\r\nhas, ever since taking office as head of the Organization,\r\nbeen working side by side with us to give real content to\r\nthe basic commitments embodied in the Charter. The\r\nAgenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development he has\r\nproduced and the consideration they have been given since\r\ntheir appearance have, we believe, been instrumental in\r\nensuring that mankind, now and in future years, will enjoy\r\nan environment of peace, security and prosperity.\r\nThe creation of the United Nations 50 years ago\r\nawakened tremendous hopes for mankind, which had, in\r\nthe space of a single generation, suffered from two\r\nparticularly savage wars with consequences that sorely\r\naffected the entire world and for which all peoples paid\r\na heavy toll.\r\nThe ambitious programme of the Organization’s\r\nfounding fathers was to ensure for the future collective\r\nsecurity, peace among nations and the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of peoples.\r\nFifty years after that profession of faith, the record\r\ncontinues to reflect the contradictions and antagonisms\r\nthat undermine our own States. However, no Organization\r\nhas so successfully embodied mankind’s hopes for a\r\nbetter world.\r\nAdmittedly, conflicts continue to exist and\r\ndevelopment seems more than ever a fantasy. However,\r\nthanks to the concerted action of States, the world has\r\nexperienced no widespread conflict. Indeed, whenever a\r\nthreat to world peace has arisen, the United Nations has\r\nbeen able to bring machinery to bear to limit the\r\ndestructive effects.\r\nThus, we have faith in the United Nations even\r\nthough the half century through which mankind has lived\r\nsince its creation has been experienced many ups and\r\ndowns. But what would it have been like had the United\r\nNations not existed to channel activities for peace, to\r\noversee the post-war period and the cold war, to give its\r\nmoral sanction to the emancipation of peoples, to\r\ncoordinate assistance for economic and social\r\ndevelopment and to set a moral standard and order\r\nrelations among nations and human beings?\r\nThose are important achievements, but they ought\r\nnot make us forgetful of the fact that on the eve of the\r\nOrganization’s fiftieth anniversary there are still many\r\nhotbeds of tension in many parts of the world.\r\nIn Europe, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nnotwithstanding some glimmers of hope on the horizon,\r\ncontinues to cause concern to all States. We hope that the\r\ntalks now under way among the parties concerned will\r\nlead to a comprehensive settlement of the situation.\r\nIn the Middle East the prospects opened up by the\r\nDeclaration of Principles signed at Washington on 13\r\nSeptember 1993 between the Government of Israel and\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization continue to yield\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\npromising results. Despite the extremists of every stamp\r\nwho are incapable of accepting alternatives to violence and\r\ndeath, negotiations have not been broken off. The signing\r\nat Washington on 28 September 1995 of the Agreement\r\nnegotiated at Taba on a timetable for the second phase of\r\nthe Israeli Army’s withdrawal from the West Bank and the\r\ntransfer of additional powers to the Palestinian Authority is\r\na further step in the right direction. Burkina Faso\r\nencourages this pattern of negotiation, which led to the\r\nPeace Treaty between Jordan and Israel of 26 October 1994\r\nand to the opening of talks on the Golan Heights between\r\nIsrael and Syria. We also encourage talks on the Lebanese-\r\nIsraeli relationship.\r\nIn Asia, Burkina Faso welcomes the spirit of dialogue\r\nand cooperation that prevails between the two Koreas and\r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and\r\nthe United States of America. We would note, however,\r\nthat a country like the Republic of China in Taiwan has not\r\nbeen able to be among us again this year, at a time when\r\nwe are to celebrate a historic event.\r\nWith respect to the question of Jammu and Kashmir,\r\nBurkina Faso urges India and Pakistan, two fraternal\r\nneighbouring countries, to find a solution to that problem\r\nthrough bilateral negotiations.\r\nThe African continent is facing many problems with\r\ndeep and complex roots. Many African countries continue\r\nto be destabilized by savage conflicts that are causing\r\nmillions of refugees and displaced persons to take to the\r\nroads and surge across international borders, where their\r\nprecarious living conditions demand our attention.\r\nIn Central Africa, the Great Lakes region remains a\r\npowder-keg that can explode at any moment. The miasma\r\nof the tragedy in Rwanda can infect other regions if the\r\nproblem of refugees and displaced persons is not very\r\nrapidly and correctly settled. We urge the Government and\r\npeople of Rwanda to continue to mobilize against\r\nextremism and to seek genuine national reconciliation based\r\non justice, equity and tolerance as well as on the country’s\r\neconomic and social reconstruction.\r\nIn Burundi, notwithstanding the efforts of the\r\ninternational community, the situation continues to be\r\ndisturbing. It seems evident that that country will enjoy\r\npeace and security only when there is a clear and manifest\r\nresolve on the part of its political leaders to guide their\r\ncountry to peace and concord without hegemonistic designs\r\nor hidden ethnic agenda. In that respect the Government\r\nConvention signed on 10 September 1994 is a starting-\r\npoint that should be respected.\r\nThe international community has a very great\r\nresponsibility in this region. Rwanda, Burundi and the\r\ncountries of asylum have an urgent and pressing need for\r\nassistance. Thus, the United Nations Conference on peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in the Great Lakes region should be\r\nconvened as soon as possible so as to give the situation\r\nall the attention it deserves.\r\nFor its part, Burkina Faso is contributing to the\r\nprocess by participating, on the one hand, in the\r\nOrganization of African Unity Observation Mission in\r\nBurundi while, on the other hand, under the auspices of\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, it is participating in the maintenance of security\r\nin the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire.\r\nIn Somalia, the warlords continue to wreak havoc in\r\nthe country, unmoved by the suffering of the Somali\r\npeople. We can only hope that as events unfold and\r\nlessons are learned from experience they will come to\r\nunderstand the vanity and incongruity of their behaviour\r\nand that they will reexamine their course of action and\r\navert disaster for their country.\r\nIn Sudan, Burkina Faso supports the work being\r\ndone by the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and\r\nDevelopment to find a solution to the fratricidal conflict\r\nthat has divided that country for so many years. We\r\nwelcome the steps in that direction being taken by\r\nPresident Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.\r\nIn West Africa the determination of the States of the\r\nsubregion and the efforts made to develop understanding\r\nand some confidence between the factions in Liberia have\r\nled to the signing at Abuja, in Nigeria, on 19 August\r\n1995, of an agreement that offers prospects of peace for\r\nLiberia. Burkina Faso, as a member of the Committee of\r\nNine on Liberia of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS), was privileged to act as\r\nwitness to that Agreement between the Liberian factions.\r\nLike the other members of ECOWAS, it will be vigilant\r\nin ensuring that its terms are strictly complied with until\r\nthe general elections scheduled for 1996 are held.\r\nSierra Leone, a neighbour of Liberia, has for a\r\nnumber of years endured a cycle of violence that has\r\ninflicted unspeakable suffering on the civilian population.\r\nAt a time when Liberia is committing itself to the path of\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\npeace, we urge those involved in the conflict in Sierra\r\nLeone to do the same, by opting for negotiations.\r\nBurkina Faso welcomes the positive developments in\r\nthe situation in Angola. We hope that the spirit of dialogue\r\nthat now prevails through the Lusaka Protocol of 20\r\nSeptember 1994 will enable that long-suffering country to\r\nreturn to the path of peace, democracy and development.\r\nI want to hail the work of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which are making\r\nenormous efforts to settle conflicts. We are firmly\r\nconvinced that peace is indivisible and that the United\r\nNations remains its primary champion throughout the\r\nworld, and especially in Africa. More than ever before,\r\nAfrica is seeking its proper course. While there is universal\r\nagreement on the need for democratic regimes, good\r\ngovernance and respect for human rights, the paths we must\r\ntravel to achieve those things are tortuous and difficult. Yet,\r\nin our view, crises stemming from the transition to\r\ndemocracy will be quickly overcome. The real grounds for\r\nconcern lie rather in the dangerous implosion we see today\r\nin African societies that are based on poorly managed\r\ndemocratic processes and chaotic governance and, above\r\nall, whose populations suffer grinding poverty.\r\nHere Africa must face up to its own realities. Without\r\nquestioning the need for international solidarity or the\r\nprimacy of the United Nations in conflict settlement,\r\nBurkina Faso, like other African countries, knows that\r\nAfrica must be the first to invest in the solution of its\r\nproblems. That is what it is doing, without waiting for\r\nadequate means to be provided. It is in that spirit that\r\nBurkina Faso and its leader, President Blaise Compaoré,\r\nhave been supporting the efforts of our brethren in\r\nneighbouring countries of the subregion and elsewhere on\r\nthe continent.\r\nIt was also in that spirit that Burkina Faso joined the\r\nother countries of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in working towards the\r\nagreement between the contending factions in Liberia. And\r\nit is in that same spirit that Burkina Faso supports the\r\nMechanism of the Organization of African Unity for the\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of Conflicts in\r\nAfrica, which is an African response to new crisis situations\r\non the continent.\r\nIn short, Africa has its problems. To be sure, it has\r\nreceived bilateral support from members of the international\r\ncommunity. But on the multilateral level, unfortunately, all\r\nthe global programmes adopted to date have been\r\nimplemented only in a timid and inadequate manner. The\r\nmost recent of these, including the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and\r\nthe Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries for the 1990s, are suffering terribly from a lack\r\nof financial resources and, to be frank, from a lack of\r\npolitical will on the part of the majority of our partners\r\nfrom the developed world. In this connection, our\r\napprehensions were confirmed by the results of the recent\r\nhigh-level intergovernmental meeting to undertake a mid-\r\nterm review of the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s.\r\nMeanwhile, our debt burden has obstructed\r\nproductive new investment, and deteriorating terms of\r\ntrade have cancelled out earnings from commodities.\r\nMore and more, Africa is losing its share of the\r\ninternational market, ultimately facing inescapable\r\nmarginalization at a time when the globalization of the\r\nworld economy is becoming apparent. But globalization\r\ndemands solidarity and interdependence. We must make\r\na choice: if wealth does not spill over borders, then\r\npoverty and destitution will.\r\nOne of the problems calling for world solidarity is\r\nthat of the environment, and especially the fight against\r\ndrought and desertification. When, faced with the great\r\ndroughts of the 1970s in Western Africa, Burkina Faso\r\nmounted a campaign to combat this scourge, the\r\ninternational community did not seem to understand its\r\nimportance. Today, protecting the environment is one of\r\nthe priority tasks of States. The Rio Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, the June 1994 adoption of\r\nthe United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification\r\nin Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa, and the entry into\r\nforce of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change have truly\r\ngiven fresh impetus to greater awareness in this area. But\r\nwhat good are all these instruments without the resources\r\nneeded to fight the evils they are meant to attack?\r\nBurkina Faso made a substantial contribution to the\r\ndrafting of the United Nations Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, and\r\nhopes that it will quickly enter into force, to give even\r\ngreater momentum to the efforts of our countries within\r\nthe Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control\r\nin the Sahel, and, with respect to East Africa, within the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Drought and\r\nDevelopment.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nOn the eve of its fiftieth anniversary the United\r\nNations stands at a crossroads. It must turn away from\r\ncold-war reflexes and stride resolutely towards the horizon\r\nof the twenty-first century. It must adapt quickly to the new\r\ncontext of a more open, globalized world, and must from\r\nnow on accept the clear determination of all States to\r\nparticipate in world affairs. In this context, the United\r\nNations needs to make the changes that will enable it to\r\nbetter profit from the contributions that States and regions\r\nare ready to make.\r\nBut the most biggest challenge facing the United\r\nNations is undoubtedly that of the poverty and destitution\r\nthat still afflict one fifth of mankind. The world of\r\nsolidarity and brotherhood that we want to build will be\r\npossible only if all human beings can live in dignity. In that\r\nconnection, we have been working for five years on\r\nprinciples and objectives for children, women, the\r\nenvironment, human rights, population and social\r\ndevelopment. Let us implement them.\r\nIt is with that hope that we approach the work of the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. On behalf of\r\nBurkina Faso, I reaffirm our complete devotion to the noble\r\nideals of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Antigua and Barbuda, His Excellency Mr.\r\nLionel Alexander Hurst.\r\nMr. Hurst (Antigua and Barbuda): Forty-five years\r\nago, in 1950, a destructive hurricane battered my island\r\ncountry. It destroyed our small homes, levelled our\r\nsugar-cane fields, left death and destruction in its path and\r\nmade Antigua and Barbuda a destitute colony. It was the\r\nvery worst hurricane that Antigua and Barbuda had ever\r\nexperienced. Several hurricanes were to strike us after\r\n1950, including Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\r\nThirty-five days ago, however, Hurricane Luis visited\r\nits fury on my small island developing State. For more than\r\n48 hours, its mighty gusts blew the roofs from thousands of\r\nhomes, schools, churches, government buildings, hotels. Its\r\nsustained winds, exceeding 160 miles per hour, uprooted\r\nmany of Antigua and Barbuda’s old trees, decapitated\r\nthousands of stately palms, and deposited the leaves and\r\nbroken limbs of our evergreen trees everywhere. The\r\nswollen sea sent surf and sand swirling into the lobbies and\r\nbeachfront rooms of our hotels — the source of our\r\nnational income. Sheets of rain, carried relentlessly by the\r\nwinds of Hurricane Luis, made everything wet and\r\neveryone weary. Our electricity and telephone systems were\r\ndestroyed when thousands of poles succumbed to the fury\r\nof its winds, snapping cables and smashing equipment as\r\nthey fell to the earth. Our fishermen lost their boats, our\r\nfarmers lost their fields, and our people lost some of our\r\ncourage. Nature appeared to have declared war on us.\r\nWhen the ferocious winds of Hurricane Luis subsided, 48\r\nhours after landfall, the verdant, lush, tropical vegetation\r\nthat had drawn millions to our shores over the years had\r\ndisappeared; our islands were a mere caricature of their\r\nprevious glory. The engine of our economy has stalled;\r\ntourism, the source of Antigua and Barbuda’s income, has\r\nbeen severely compromised and we may not be able to\r\nrestart the industry for several weeks. Fishermen and\r\nfarmers, storekeepers and hotel workers are now without\r\nincomes; thousands are jobless. The threat of creeping\r\npoverty hangs over a people that, 14 years ago, at the end\r\nof 150 years of colonialism, had started to enjoy an\r\nimproved standard of living, higher than ever recorded in\r\nour 350-year modern history. Forty-eight hours after\r\nHurricane Luis had traversed the Caribbean, the\r\nvulnerability of small island States was again made\r\nmanifest. Dominica, Guadeloupe, Saint Kitts and Nevis,\r\nSaint Maarten, Anguilla and Montserrat all suffered a fate\r\nsimilar to Antigua and Barbuda’s. Coming on the heels of\r\nLuis, Hurricane Marilyn would batter the island of Saint\r\nThomas. Small island States and territories, thriving and\r\nrobust on one day, were paralysed and incapacitated\r\nwithin 48 hours.\r\nDevelopment is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are\r\nto trample through our region each year; yet climate\r\nexperts have given us notice that the phenomenon known\r\nas global warming will generate a greater number of\r\n“extreme weather events”, more ferocious and monstrous\r\nin each succeeding year. Hurricane Luis was 700 miles\r\nwide; its wind gusts reached almost 200 miles per hour;\r\nand its sustained winds exceeded 160 miles per hour. It\r\nwas unique in its size and devilish in its fury.\r\nThere may never be sufficient evidence to link the\r\nglobal warming phenomenon to any single hurricane; but\r\nthe pattern is evident. I draw the Assembly’s attention to\r\na study entitled “Confronting Climate Change”, published\r\nby the Cambridge University Press. In it we read:\r\n“If global temperatures continue to rise in\r\naccordance with current predictions, increases in the\r\nnumber and severity of storms, floods, droughts, and\r\nother short-term weather extremes may be one of the\r\nearliest observed and most dramatic effects.”\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nCarbon dioxide emissions, caused by the burning of\r\npetroleum, coal, wood and gas, since the start of the\r\nindustrial revolution in Western Europe 200 years ago, have\r\nbegun to warm the planet and to place the survival of small\r\nislands in jeopardy.\r\nThree years ago, at the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil,\r\nthe nations of the world had their representatives sign the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nI read from the Convention:\r\n“The ultimate objective of this Convention and\r\nany related legal instruments that the Conference of\r\nthe Parties may adopt is to achieve ... stabilization of\r\ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a\r\nlevel that would prevent dangerous [man-made]\r\ninterference with the climate system.” (article 2)\r\nEarlier this year, the nations of the world met in\r\nBerlin, Germany, to consider a proposal matching this\r\nobjective and linked to this Convention; it was put forward\r\nby 41 vulnerable small island States. Many industrialized\r\ncountries, guilty of emitting into our Earth’s atmosphere\r\nbillions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\r\ngases, would not then agree to any reduction in these gases.\r\nWe cannot stand idly by, experience the deadly effects of\r\nglobal warming, and be satisfied with promises. Harmful\r\nproduction, wasteful consumption and dangerous disposal\r\npatterns continue to characterize the behaviour of the largest\r\nindustrialized States. They sow the wind; small island\r\nStates reap the whirlwind. In the South Pacific, where\r\ndefenceless small island States predominate, another large\r\nindustrialized State chooses to explode several nuclear\r\nbombs, euphemistically called “nuclear devices”. We\r\nremain opposed to the testing of all nuclear weapons. If\r\nthose bombs are as harmless and as safe as that State\r\nclaims, then why not test them on its own soil? The same\r\ndisregard for the weak and small States holds for the\r\ntransboundary movement of hazardous wastes, especially\r\nshipments of nuclear wastes through the Caribbean Sea. We\r\nare dreadfully afraid of an accident and equally fearful of\r\nthe impact of news of an accident on our development.\r\nWe have done much of what is required of us to\r\nensure that our development proceeds apace and with few\r\nsetbacks. Evidence of our intelligent use of our meagre\r\nresource base is captured in the annual Human\r\nDevelopment Report published by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). For example, my\r\nCaribbean country shares a common currency with five\r\nother small island States and one territory. We call it the\r\nEastern Caribbean dollar. Its value has remained unchanged\r\nsince 1976. For almost two decades, self-discipline and\r\nprobity have been the hallmark of the Eastern Caribbean\r\nCentral Bank.\r\nHurricane Luis has severely disabled four of the\r\nseven economies which share the currency — Dominica,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua and\r\nBarbuda. And unfair attempts by Central American\r\nbanana producers to eliminate the English-speaking\r\nCaribbean’s 3 per cent of the world market share threaten\r\nto undo the other three economies — those of Grenada,\r\nSaint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The\r\nEastern Caribbean dollar (EC$) can only remain stable if\r\nour economies earn foreign exchange. Unfair trade, just\r\nlike hurricanes, can devastate our vulnerable small island\r\nStates’ economies and make the earning of foreign\r\nexchange impossible.\r\nWe share a currency, and we share a university. The\r\nUniversity of the West Indies is soon to celebrate its\r\nfiftieth year of continued existence, having graduated an\r\noverwhelming number of professionals from the 17 States\r\nand territories of the English-speaking Caribbean which\r\ncall it their own. This year my Government provided 73\r\nscholarships to the most deserving youth in Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, with amounts ranging from $EC 54,000 to\r\n$10,000 each. We intend to build the national capacity to\r\nensure that sustainable human development is more than\r\na wish.\r\nWe share a currency, we share a university, we share\r\na judiciary. The Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeals has\r\ndemonstrated that justice and cost-effectiveness can be\r\ntwin handmaids of small island States. Eight of us also\r\ncombine our national defence forces to form a Regional\r\nSecurity System (RSS). Though small by any standard,\r\nwe have succeeded in increasing our defences\r\nexponentially, while containing defence costs\r\nsignificantly. The recent invasion of the Comoros Islands\r\nby a mercenary band which took its President hostage and\r\nseized power there serves as a reminder of the security\r\nconstraints facing small island States.\r\nOur efforts at regional collaboration extend beyond\r\na common currency, a university, a judiciary and a\r\ndefence force. You have recently pronounced, Sir, on the\r\nsuccess of “interlocking, regional building blocks” in\r\nEurope. Thirty years ago, before many of our Caribbean\r\ncountries were independent and free, we commenced that\r\nprocess by creating, in 1965, the Caribbean Free Trade\r\nAgreement (Carita). Carita has metamorphosed into the\r\nCaribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom),\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nand earlier this year the Association of Caribbean States\r\n(ACS) was formed by all the States and territories which\r\nshare the Caribbean Sea. More than 200 million people\r\nform this new market. Antigua and Barbuda has done much\r\nof what is required of it to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The results of our many and varied efforts\r\ncannot bear fruit if, year after year, hurricanes destroy that\r\nwhich we have created. We look to the United Nations to\r\nhelp in persuading the industrialized countries to adopt the\r\nToronto targets, as a first step in our common effort to\r\nensure the survival of this planet which we all share.\r\nWe have faith in the United Nations because the\r\nimage of the United Nations in my country and region is\r\npositive and good. When a volcano threatened to erupt on\r\nthe neighbouring island of Montserrat and my country\r\noffered safe refuge to half of that island’s population, the\r\nUnited Nations Resident Representative in Barbados led a\r\nUnited Nations team of experts to Antigua; they came to\r\ndetermine how the United Nations could assist. Following\r\nthe devastation wrought by Hurricane Luis, the United\r\nNations Development Programme Barbados country office,\r\nthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health\r\nOrganization and several other United Nations agencies and\r\nbodies quickly launched an international appeal to help us\r\nreconstruct. The most distinguished citizen of Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, His Excellency the Governor-General, was also\r\nquick to agree to be the Chairman of the UN 50 National\r\nCommittee. This willingness serves as a measure of the\r\nhigh regard in which the United Nations is held.\r\nMy small island State can also boast that it has paid\r\nits contribution to the United Nations in full; we owe no\r\narrears, despite the burden which membership dues and\r\npeace-keeping operations impose on our limited resources.\r\nWe can only encourage the wealthy and the powerful to\r\npay their obligations. For us the United Nations is more\r\nthan a symbol; more, too, than an instrument for the narrow\r\nnational interests of Antigua and Barbuda. For us, the\r\nUnited Nations is the guarantor of international law, an\r\nagent for international peace and security, a catalyst for\r\ndevelopment and prosperity.\r\nThe Secretary-General has noted that the greatest\r\nthreats to peace are adverse social and economic conditions\r\nwithin States and among States. As a consequence, during\r\nthe past three years the international community has\r\nconvened six global conferences to plot the course of\r\nhuman history in the coming century and beyond.\r\nCollectively, the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, the First Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nand the Fourth World Conference on Women collectively\r\ncreate a multifaceted framework of action; this will be\r\ncompleted by the Second United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Settlements (Habitat II), in 1996. These\r\nconferences act as a guide to Member States as they seek\r\nto address the challenges inherent in the interrelated areas\r\nof peace and development.\r\nStates must now seek to implement the several\r\nProgrammes of Action. We are particularly gratified by\r\nthe extent to which the last two conferences build on the\r\npositions which we took at the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. In particular, my delegation would wish to\r\nemphasize the importance of empowering women. The\r\ninclusion of women in the councils of the Government of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, and at senior levels in the public\r\nservice and the private sector, gives credence to the\r\nearnestness of our commitment to the advancement of\r\nwomen. Without the full and equal participation of\r\nwomen, sustainable development cannot be achieved.\r\nIn congratulating you on your election to your high\r\noffice, Mr. President, my country is very cognizant of the\r\nrole which Vasco da Gama played in bringing distant\r\nworlds together. Today we find in you the same foresight\r\nand imagination displayed by your most well-known\r\ncitizen. These qualities are necessary for leading this\r\nhistoric fiftieth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. We congratulate Foreign Minister Mr. Amara\r\nEssy, the President of the forty-ninth session, on his\r\nsterling stewardship of this Organization.\r\nAt several junctures in its 50-year history, the\r\npurpose and goals of this United Nations have been\r\nredefined. In 1945, following the end of the Second\r\nWorld War, the United Nations was created as a policy\r\ninstrument of the victorious Powers to prevent further\r\nlarge-scale destruction and massive loss of life. For more\r\nthan a decade the United Nations was focused on\r\npreventing a third world war.\r\nIn 1957 a little country in Africa twisted the tail of\r\nits colonial master, and Kwame Nkrumah emerged from\r\njail in Ghana to lead his country and to redefine the\r\npurpose of this United Nations. When the United Nations\r\nwas created in 1945, colonialism defined the relations\r\nbetween the powerful and the weak, between Europe and\r\nmuch of Asia and Africa. The adoption of resolution\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\n1514 (XV) in 1960 turned the United Nations into a policy\r\ninstrument to end colonialism.\r\nFor more than a decade after 1960 the focus of the\r\nUnited Nations was to destroy colonialism and apartheid.\r\nMy small island nation did not even enter into the\r\nconsciousness of the founders in 1945. We are the\r\nbeneficiaries of the struggle to end colonialism. The\r\npresence here of small island States is mere happenstance,\r\nsince few expected that there could be any such creation as\r\na micro-State, seated in this Hall as an equal of the\r\nmightiest and the largest States. In that regard, we would\r\nwish to welcome the island State of Palau to membership\r\nin this Organization.\r\nBut by 1970 the United Nations had begun to address\r\ninequities in international trade and development, and the\r\nsearch for a more just international economic order\r\ndisplaced the concerns of 1945. In the 1970s, also, the cold\r\nwar exploded. Regional wars in southern Africa, Central\r\nAmerica and the Middle East were fuelled by the two\r\nsuper-Powers. By the end of the 1980s the constraints\r\nimposed by the cold war and the demands on our resources\r\nfor peace-keeping made the United Nations a much more\r\ncomplicated instrument than it had ever been.\r\nToday our United Nations must struggle with the\r\nunfinished business of earlier decades. Small island States,\r\nin the 1990s, aware that their very existence is at stake,\r\nhave tried to make the United Nations focus on the\r\nenvironment and development, especially climate change.\r\nIf we fail in this quest, this civilization will destroy us and,\r\nin the process, destroy itself. Island States are much like the\r\ncanary in the coal mine; we are the messengers, signalling\r\nthe danger to the rest of the world.\r\nHaving suffered through Hurricane Hugo and\r\nHurricane Luis, we thank the many Governments,\r\ninstitutions and people who have come to our rescue. The\r\npeople of Antigua and Barbuda are aware of the\r\nvulnerability of small islands. We know our history and we\r\nknow the role played by small States in shaping the present.\r\nMy Prime Minister, the Honourable Lester Bryant Bird, has\r\napplauded the people of Antigua and Barbuda for their\r\nresilience and indomitable will in the face of adversity. If\r\nwe can endure 200 years of chattel slavery, and 150 years\r\nof brutal colonialism, then surely we can recover from two\r\nnights of a horrible hurricane, he has said. We believe that\r\nsmall island States at this United Nations can also shape the\r\nnext five decades in human history. We are here for that\r\npurpose, and we intend to succeed.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of the United Republic of Tanzania, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Daudi Ngelautwa Mwakawago.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (Tanzania): It is a great honour\r\nfor me to speak on behalf of my delegation, since my\r\nForeign Minister is currently campaigning in the\r\nimpending presidential and parliamentary elections.\r\nAllow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election\r\nas President of the historic fiftieth session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. You bring to this office a\r\nwealth of experience and rich intellectual and diplomatic\r\nskill which assure us of a fruitful conclusion of the work\r\nbefore the session. And, above all, my delegation\r\napplauds your sensitivity to development issues.\r\nA well-deserved tribute is also due to your\r\ndistinguished predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Côte d’Ivoire, who successfully presided over\r\nthe forty-ninth session.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to pay tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\r\nindefatigable efforts in the search for peace and\r\ndevelopment are very well appreciated by my\r\nGovernment and the people of Tanzania. We also salute\r\nthe selfless efforts and commitment of the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the Secretariat staff in the service of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate Tanzania’s firm\r\nconviction that the United Nations is all of us - its\r\nMembers. It does not exist apart from us, nor should it be\r\nused by one Member or group of Members to the\r\ndetriment of the wishes and hopes of the international\r\ncommunity. It can do only what we, its Members, are\r\nprepared to do, acting together.\r\nMr. Moubarak (Lebanon), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThis is not to say that our Organization is perfect\r\nand sacrosanct, and therefore beyond criticism. On the\r\ncontrary, much as we derive satisfaction from the fact that\r\nthe United Nations has survived 50 difficult years, there\r\nis plenty of scope to re-examine its role, especially now,\r\nas we are on the threshold of the next millennium.\r\nWork in this direction has already started, and it has\r\nbeen covered in the comprehensive report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization. The\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nreport draws our attention to the work under way and what\r\nneeds to be done about problems which threaten\r\ninternational peace and security. It is up to nation States\r\nwhich are Members of the United Nations to reflect on, and\r\nassess the role of, the only universal organization at the\r\ndisposal of all humankind.\r\nUndoubtedly the United Nations has been doing the\r\nbest possible in the pursuit of the lofty ideals of the\r\nCharter — in particular, in regard to maintaining\r\ninternational peace; economic and social advancement for\r\nall peoples, and enhancing human rights. While loudly\r\nfaulted on its peace-keeping role, the silent achievements of\r\nthe United Nations agencies, including the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization\r\n(WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO), the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO), need not be simply taken for granted.\r\nEven in terms of peace-keeping operations, we only\r\nneed to ask why it was possible to succeed in Namibia,\r\nCambodia, El Salvador, South Africa and Mozambique, and\r\nwhy prospects are now brightening in Angola, under United\r\nNations leadership, while we have not quite succeeded in\r\nSomalia, Rwanda or Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAs I speak, conflicts are raging unabated in the world,\r\nespecially in parts of Africa, the Balkans and the Caucasus.\r\nA lot of work is yet to be done in the area of\r\npeace-keeping. Every effort must be made to enhance the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations along the lines described in\r\nthe 1992 “An Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277) and its\r\nsupplement (A/50/60), issued in January this year.\r\nThe real problem with the United Nations rests with\r\nthe new post-cold-war era. The promises of peace have\r\neluded us and as a result we are still “in the woods”\r\nregarding the international community’s ability to manage\r\nnon-military transnational issues, including development,\r\nenvironmental degradation and inequalities within and\r\nbetween nations.\r\nOne point of grave concern to my delegation is that\r\nthe new world order — if there is order at all — has tended\r\nto perpetuate the situation in which the wealthy and\r\npowerful nation-States dominate and seek to exert undue\r\ninfluence on the United Nations. Consequently, United\r\nNations reform is urgent and imperative. The thrust of\r\nthis reform must be to maintain and enhance the\r\ndemocratic values of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand translate them into reality throughout the work of the\r\nOrganization. We must jealously guard the central role of\r\nthe General Assembly, in which all Member States,\r\nregardless of size or wealth, have an equal say. Careful\r\nattention should be given to the functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council. We must ensure that the Council acts\r\nwithin and in accordance with the Charter and that its\r\nmembership reflects the realities of our times, taking into\r\naccount the tremendous expansion from 51 Member\r\nStates in 1945 to 185 in 1995.\r\nIn welcoming the report of the General Assembly’s\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, my delegation restates the need to have\r\ndeveloping countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean represented in the Council, in terms of\r\nboth permanent and non-permanent seats. Secondly, not\r\nonly is transparency in the functioning of the Council\r\nnecessary, but there must also be a regularized system of\r\nreporting to, and consultation with, the General Assembly.\r\nThirdly, the veto power has outlived its usefulness. It\r\nshould be abolished, since it is a negation of democratic\r\nprinciples to empower any one member, or group of\r\nmembers, to decide on the vital issues of peace and\r\nsecurity without due regard to the sensitivity and wishes\r\nof the majority.\r\nThe reform process under way should focus also on\r\nrestoring the Economic and Social Council to its intended\r\nhigh status as the organ for bringing all international\r\neconomic and social affairs under the strategic control of\r\nthe United Nations, and here I refer to Article 63 of the\r\nCharter. My delegation believes that the governance of\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions should be democratized,\r\nalong with their internal decision-making mechanisms.\r\nLet me conclude the question of reform by quoting\r\nthe very apt perception of the South Centre:\r\n“The opposition to a strong and dynamic United\r\nNations is political and profoundly ideological, and\r\nis largely concentrated in a few States whose\r\nestablishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in\r\nwhich their domestic and global policies can be\r\nchallenged or trimmed. But the United Nations\r\nexists for all humankind, not just a handful of\r\nMember States representing a small minority of the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nworld’s population ... . This is not a time for despair\r\nbut for determined efforts to rekindle the United\r\nNations original inspirations and to inject a new sense\r\nof purposeful direction ... to help fulfil the aspirations\r\nof many millions of people throughout the world.”\r\nThe financing of the United Nations by Member States\r\nis also badly in need of reform. As we meet here, our\r\nOrganization is on the brink of bankruptcy. As of early\r\nAugust, unpaid assessed contributions stood at $3.9 billion.\r\nMy delegation is in agreement with the Secretary-General\r\nwhen he laments that\r\n“there is no use talking about reshaping the\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations unless the\r\nresources are there to carry out those responsibilities”.\r\nIt is urgent that action be taken to make good on late\r\npayments of assessed contributions, for both the regular\r\nbudget and peace-keeping operations, without any\r\npreconditions. Having said that, my delegation believes that,\r\non the one hand, the principle of financing the United\r\nNations should be on the basis of relative capacity to pay,\r\nand secondly, that other options should be explored that\r\nwould lessen overdependence on the policy inclinations of\r\na few Members.\r\nI should like now to turn to conflicts closest to the\r\nheart of the Government and people of Tanzania: the\r\nsituations in neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi. It is\r\nheartening to note that the situation in Rwanda is gradually\r\nreturning to normal following the end of genocide and the\r\nfratricidal war of July 1994. Tanzania, in the true spirit of\r\ngood-neighbourliness, salutes the new government’s efforts\r\nto consolidate peace, rebuild State institutions and make\r\nnational reconciliation a reality on the basis of the Arusha\r\nPeace Agreement.\r\nTanzania, besides facilitating political mediation for\r\nthe two neighbouring countries, has always readily\r\nwelcomed Rwandese and Burundi peoples fleeing atrocities\r\nin their homelands. The Government is anxious that the\r\nnow more than one million refugees concentrated in the\r\nwestern part of the country should be assisted to return\r\nhome as soon as possible, but it should be sooner rather\r\nthan later. It is a huge burden of immense proportions. My\r\nGovernment is appreciative of the international assistance\r\nthat is directed to the refugees and to Tanzania. However,\r\nthe ideal solution is to facilitate their speedy return to their\r\ncountries of origin so that they may become part of the\r\nreconstruction and reconciliation efforts. To do otherwise is\r\nto postpone the problem and sow the seeds of future\r\nconflicts and mistrust.\r\nWorse still, long-term damage to the environment is\r\nnow a reality. Urgent measures are required to prevent the\r\narea of concentration from being stripped bare of trees.\r\nPressure on the already overstretched infrastructure and\r\nsocial services remains overwhelming. This humanitarian\r\ncatastrophe must not be allowed to go on indefinitely. My\r\nGovernment believes that the reconstruction efforts being\r\nput in place must have a component for the return of\r\nrefugees.\r\nNo effort should be spared to help the two\r\nneighbouring countries create an environment conducive\r\nto the return of their peoples. In this connection, we take\r\nnote of the Secretary- General’s efforts to convene a\r\nGreat Lakes region conference on security, stability and\r\ndevelopment, in line with the decisions of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and Security\r\nCouncil. But my Government is of the view that\r\ncommensurate efforts should first be made to implement\r\nthe Nairobi and Bujumbura declarations on stability and\r\nthe situation in the refugee camps. We also urge the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees and other organizations on the ground to extend\r\nto the region the quick impact programmes that are\r\ncurrently being undertaken in Mozambique and Somalia.\r\nThese programmes are aimed at meeting the reintegration\r\nand rehabilitation needs of returnees on their arrival\r\nhome.\r\nMention should also be made of my Government’s\r\nreadiness to cooperate in establishing the seat of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda at Arusha in\r\nnorthern Tanzania. The judges have since been appointed,\r\nand the Registrar of the Tribunal is already in Tanzania\r\nas part of the preparatory team. It is my delegation’s view\r\nthat an early start of the Tribunal’s proceedings should go\r\na long way towards helping the healing process in\r\nRwanda.\r\nConcerning Burundi, we commend the work of the\r\npeace mission of the Organization of African Unity and\r\nappeal to the leaders of all parties to rise above parochial\r\ninterests and work in the larger interest of their country,\r\nAfrica and the world.\r\nMy delegation is especially encouraged by the\r\npositive developments in Angola, which, as we heard\r\nfrom its Foreign Minister when he addressed the current\r\nsession, is finally headed towards peaceful settlement\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nunder the terms of the Lusaka Protocol and the Bicesse\r\nAccords. We are also hopeful that the deployment of the\r\nUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM\r\nIII) will be speeded up, to ensure that the peace process\r\nremains on course.\r\nRegarding Liberia, we are encouraged by the recent\r\ndevelopments by which the OAU and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in\r\nparticular have secured agreement among faction leaders\r\naimed at a peaceful resolution of the long-simmering civil\r\nwar. The United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia also\r\ndeserves our appreciation for its contribution. Consequently,\r\nit is our hope that the positive developments in Liberia will\r\nimpact on the restive situation in neighbouring Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nRegrettably, four years on, the international\r\ncommunity has yet to implement the United Nations peace\r\nplan calling for a referendum in Western Sahara. The\r\nparties concerned, Morocco and the Polisario Front, need to\r\nsummon their political will and, without undue\r\nprevarication, cooperate fully with the United Nations in\r\nspeeding up the process.\r\nAfrica has received with anger reports of recent\r\nmercenary interference in the Comoros. The perpetration of\r\nsuch a dastardly act must not be countenanced by the\r\ninternational community, in particular the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation supports the OAU call for the speedy and\r\nunconditional restoration of the constitutional order in that\r\nAfrican country and would also wish to recall the General\r\nAssembly’s resolution on the sovereignty of the Islamic\r\nFederal Republic of the Comoros over the island of\r\nMayotte.\r\nWe welcome progress in the Middle East situation.\r\nThe signing in Washington of the latest agreement between\r\nthe Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization represents an important step towards the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Principles. We hope\r\nprogress will also be made on the other fronts in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973).\r\nAs for the Balkans, my delegation supports United\r\nNations peace-keeping and other international efforts aimed\r\nat finding a lasting solution to the conflict in the former\r\nYugoslavia. We urge all parties to the conflict to invest in\r\na political settlement and to resist the temptation of a\r\nmilitary solution.\r\nThe continuing threat of hunger and poverty to\r\nworld peace and security cannot be overemphasized.\r\nTheir impact on the developing countries is made clear by\r\nthe stagnant or negative rates of economic growth and\r\ndeclining real per capita incomes in most of the South,\r\nespecially in the least developed countries, including\r\nTanzania. As the Administrator of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme said recently:\r\n“Poverty is growing faster than population.\r\nThere are scores of countries where progress is\r\ngoing backwards rather than forwards. Rich\r\ncountries are not going to be able to build a wall\r\naround themselves and shut themselves off. These\r\nproblems don’t need passports.”\r\nInternal and external factors alike have contributed\r\nto the underdevelopment of the largest segment of the\r\nworld. The debt crisis, depressed prices of primary\r\ncommodities, protectionist measures, the inadequate flow\r\nof direct foreign investment and financial and technical\r\nassistance, and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few\r\nof the factors adversely affecting socio-economic\r\nperformance in most of these countries.\r\nIt is with this frustrating situation in mind that we\r\nintend to continue participating in the work of the Ad\r\nHoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An\r\nAgenda for Development. It must become a true vehicle\r\nfor ending poverty the world over. Other supportive\r\nUnited Nations agencies, especially UNCTAD, which will\r\nbe holding its ninth conference in South Africa next year,\r\nand UNIDO should be accorded their due importance by\r\nthe international community as true instruments of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDuring the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on\r\nthe Mid-term Global Review of the Implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\r\nfor the 1990s, there was some North-South meeting of\r\nminds on what Governments ought to do individually and\r\ntogether to reverse the trend of underdevelopment. My\r\nGovernment reaffirmed its commitment to continue\r\nimplementing socio-economic reforms considered\r\nbeneficial to our people. Inevitable difficulties aside, the\r\nfocus is on sectors concerned with agriculture, industry,\r\nfinance, civil service, trade and privatization.\r\nAt the same time, we are undertaking political\r\nreforms which are essential not only for good governance,\r\nbut also for the creation of the necessary environment for\r\neconomic management and sustainable growth. This\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nexercise culminates in the multi-party national elections that\r\nwill take place towards the end of this month. The\r\nunderstanding and cooperation of our traditional donor\r\ncountries have been instrumental in supplementing our own\r\nefforts. We also count on the international community’s\r\ncommitment to implement fully existing programmes such\r\nas the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s and the conclusions of a series of\r\nUnited Nations world conferences, including the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, successfully concluded in\r\nBeijing, China, last month.\r\nIn conclusion, let me refer to two other important\r\ndevelopments since the forty-ninth session. First, regarding\r\ndisarmament, we hope that the controversial indefinite\r\nextension last May of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons will lead to total nuclear disarmament\r\nand the immediate cessation and complete elimination of\r\nnuclear testing. Secondly, we urge the international\r\ncommunity to iron out differences over how to constitute\r\nthe membership of the International Seabed Authority\r\nCouncil, in order to formalize the work of this important\r\ninstrument, the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea.\r\nFinally, my delegation is privileged to be a part of this\r\nhistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly, whose\r\nwork should further reaffirm our commitment to\r\nmultilateralism. We look forward to celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations later this month, when\r\nwe will be called upon to reflect together on how best to\r\nequip our Organization on the eve of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Nevertheless, it is important to bear constantly in\r\nmind the fact that, for developing countries and especially\r\nthe least developed among them, it is not a time of\r\nrejoicing. I can do no better than to quote the address of\r\nmy President, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, to the General Assembly\r\nat its forty-ninth session, in which he said:\r\n“A supportive international environment is crucial\r\nif we are to attain sustained economic growth in\r\ndeveloping countries, especially in the least developed\r\nones. The United Nations must be able to play a much\r\ngreater role in this matter because, unlike the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, the United Nations is universal; its\r\nprogrammes operate everywhere; and it does not\r\nignore countries.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Forty-ninth session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n16th meeting, p. 5)\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mihai Popov.\r\nMr. Popov (Moldova) (interpretation from French):\r\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations and best wishes for success to Mr. Freitas\r\ndo Amaral upon his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. We are\r\nconvinced that, with his profound knowledge of current\r\nglobal problems and his open attitude to the realities of\r\ninternational life, he will make a very important\r\ncontribution towards the achievement of the objectives of\r\nthis session.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to address my\r\nsincere thanks to Mr. Amara Essy for his productive work\r\nduring his presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session.\r\nI should also like to convey to Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, the Secretary-General of our appreciation for his\r\nefforts to improve the functioning of the United Nations\r\nand to assure him of the full support of the Republic of\r\nMoldova.\r\nIn this anniversary year, Moldova celebrates the\r\npassage of four years since the proclamation of its\r\nindependence and three years since its admission to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOver these years of complex structural changes, we\r\nhave preserved our aspiration of becoming a democratic\r\nState with a market economy, despite the difficulties of\r\ntransition. Our country has already taken the first steps in\r\nthis direction by embarking irreversibly upon the path of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the process of democratic\r\ntransformation in Moldova has been supported and is\r\nbeing supported by the international community and,\r\nprimarily, by the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies. Therefore, I wish to express our gratitude to the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States for their substantial\r\nsupport in the promotion of the ongoing reforms in our\r\ncountry.\r\nIn this context, I should like to describe the main\r\ndevelopments which have taken place in our society this\r\nyear, as well as our most important present concerns.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nIn its foreign policy, the Republic of Moldova, a\r\nneutral State not involved in political-military alliances, is\r\ndeveloping mutually beneficial relations of friendship and\r\ncooperation with all States. It also intends to extend its\r\nbilateral links with neighbouring States, as well as with its\r\ntraditional partners.\r\nIn our domestic policy we have had two main\r\npriorities: to develop and consolidate the legal and\r\ninstitutional framework of a State of law and the smooth\r\nfunctioning of institutions appropriate to a modern\r\ndemocratic society on the one hand, and, on the other, to\r\nensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market\r\neconomy.\r\nSo far, our country has succeeded in setting up a\r\nnumber of basic institutions for the rule of law. A modern\r\nconstitution that guarantees political pluralism, private\r\nownership and respect for fundamental human rights,\r\nincluding rights for persons belonging to ethnic minorities,\r\nhas recently been adopted. Likewise, it assures the exercise\r\nof political liberty, a fact that is proved by the existence of\r\nnumerous political parties and by the possibility of the free\r\nexpression of political opinions. The Parliament has drafted\r\nand adopted a number of laws of major importance.\r\nThe progress achieved by our country in the process\r\nof transition has been facilitated, to a certain extent, by\r\nbilateral cooperation with other States and in the framework\r\nof various international bodies. Among the positive effects\r\nof this cooperation have been a quickening in the pace of\r\ninternal reforms and the process of integration into\r\nEuropean political and economic structures. In this respect,\r\na major event in the external relationships of the Republic\r\nof Moldova has been its admission to the European\r\nCouncil. This is both a recognition of the progress achieved\r\nby our country on the way towards democratization and an\r\nencouragement to further build up the rule of law and a\r\ndemocratic society.\r\nAs for economic restructuring and the transition to a\r\nmarket economy, I can state that a number of difficulties\r\nare in the process of being overcome. This year new\r\nmeasures have taken aim at halting the decline in industrial\r\noutput, which constitutes an important prerequisite for the\r\nrelaunching of economic growth. Through a new monetary\r\nand fiscal policy, we have managed to reduce inflation and\r\nstabilize the national currency. Moreover, it is worth\r\nrestating our willingness to continue our fruitful cooperation\r\nin this field with the international financial institutions,\r\nprimarily the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\r\nWorld Bank.\r\nAt present we are engaged in a crucial stage of the\r\nreform, particularly that dealing with wide-scale\r\nprivatization. My government is mostly concerned to\r\nspeed up privatization in the hope that this will spur\r\neconomic reform and encourage not only internal\r\ninvestment, but also foreign capital and credits. In this\r\ncontext, I should emphasize that the difficulties\r\nencountered in carrying out economic reforms are linked,\r\nto a great extent, to the shortage of financial, energy and\r\nraw materials resources. The assistance we have received\r\nso far from the international financial institutions and\r\nfrom some developed countries has had a visible positive\r\nimpact. Nevertheless, substantial and sustained external\r\nfinancial support is still needed for the creation of a\r\nmodern restructured economy.\r\nThat is why we are counting, in particular, on the\r\nsupport of the European Union for securing the success of\r\nour transition. Our efforts aiming at building a market\r\neconomy and integrating our country into the European\r\npolitical and economic structures would be strongly\r\nhelped by its supportive signals and actions. The signing\r\nof the agreement of partnership and cooperation with the\r\nEuropean Union towards the end of last year and the\r\nrecent signing of the Interim Commercial Agreement have\r\nbeen major steps in this direction.\r\nThe difficult process of transition is being adversely\r\naffected by the anti-constitutional actions undertaken by\r\na separatist regime which exerts temporary control over\r\neastern districts of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nThe Assembly may remember the armed conflict\r\nwhich was unleashed in 1992 by the separatist movement,\r\nwith external support, in the east of Moldova. Although\r\nthis conflict ended, its consequences still persist. We\r\ncannot but note the gross violations of the fundamental\r\nhuman rights of the Moldovan population in this area.\r\nMention should also be made of the group of political\r\ndetainees, known as the “Ilascu group”, which was\r\nillegally convicted and jailed by the anti-constitutional\r\nauthorities of the Transdniester three years ago, and is\r\nstill in prison.\r\nNor can we omit mention of the obstinate refusal of\r\nthe separatist leaders to allow the Moldovan parents and\r\nchildren to use the Latin alphabet in the study of their\r\nmother tongue. That is why the representatives of the\r\ncompetent international organizations in the field of\r\nhuman rights have noted a series of abuses and violations\r\nof the rights of the Moldovan population living in the\r\neastern districts of the Republic.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nAlthough the situation of the Transdniester is no\r\nlonger in the forefront of international public opinion, it\r\nshould be noted that no acceptable solution has been\r\nidentified so far. Despite the reasonable compromises\r\nproposed by the constitutional authorities, separatist\r\ntendencies still persist. I should like to stress that the\r\npolitical leaders of my country have repeatedly\r\ndemonstrated their willingness to solve this conflict\r\nexclusively by peaceful means by negotiation, in conformity\r\nwith international law and in cooperation with international\r\norganizations, primarily with the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as with Russia\r\nand Ukraine in their capacity of mediators. In a spirit of\r\ncompromise, my Government also firmly believes in the\r\nprinciple that any proposal or initiative to settle the conflict\r\nmust provide for the maintenance of the territorial integrity\r\nof the Republic of Moldova and for its sovereignty over the\r\nwhole country. It was this spirit that led this year to the\r\nsolution of the conflict situation in the southern region of\r\nMoldova, which is populated by over 100,000 Gagauz who\r\nobtained, under the Constitution, the status of administrative\r\nterritorial autonomy.\r\nAs for the latest developments in the negotiations with\r\nTiraspol, I should mention that a certain amount of progress\r\nhas already been made, particularly in the matter of the re-\r\nestablishment of economic links between Transdniester and\r\nthe rest of the country.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that a political settlement\r\nof the conflict in this area could be achieved through the\r\norderly and unconditional withdrawal of military troops of\r\nthe Russian Federation from the territory of our country, in\r\nconformity with the Moldovan-Russian agreement and the\r\nresolutions of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE).\r\nIn this regard, we are still concerned that, although the\r\nMoldovan-Russian agreement was signed last year by the\r\nHeads of Government of the Republic of Moldova and the\r\nRussian Federation, in the presence of Presidents Mircea\r\nSnegur and Boris Yeltsin, it has not yet been brought into\r\nforce by the Russian side. I take this opportunity to voice\r\nour sincere hope that the competent authorities of the\r\nRussian Federation will speed up the procedure for the\r\nratification of this document, in accordance with their\r\nobligations. I must emphasize that any possible failure to\r\nimplement this important agreement might incur the risk of\r\ndestabilizing the situation in the eastern districts of\r\nMoldova, as well as the real danger that a part of the\r\narmaments of the Fourteenth Army will be seized by the\r\nseparatist forces of the Transdniester.\r\nWe hope that the competent authorities of the\r\nRussian Federation will as soon as possible set up\r\neffective machinery for the withdrawal of Russian troops\r\nand armaments from Moldova, in accordance with the\r\nbilateral agreement I have mentioned and the decisions\r\nadopted by the OSCE Budapest Summit.\r\nThe jubilee year of the United Nations is not only an\r\nanniversary but also an occasion for a lucid assessment of\r\nthe achievements and failures of the first 50 years of the\r\nOrganization’s existence. In this respect, I want to\r\nemphasize that the United Nations has made an important\r\ncontribution in the search for and identification of\r\nsolutions to the numerous urgent problems at the global,\r\nregional and national levels. Even if it has not managed\r\nto prevent or eliminate regional or local conflicts, the\r\nOrganization has played an essential role in preventing\r\nthe outbreak of a world conflagration.\r\nThe evolution of international relations over the past\r\nyears has provided favourable conditions for redefining\r\nthe role of the United Nations and for adapting it better\r\nto the new realities of international life in the context of\r\nthe next millennium. If this is to be achieved, there will\r\nhave to be a new vision, as well as a redefinition of\r\nconcrete machinery for achieving the fundamental\r\nobjectives of the Organization, as inscribed in the Charter.\r\nAlong the same lines, I should say that recent years\r\nhave been marked by the appearance of new concepts,\r\nwhich could serve as a basis for the diversification of\r\nmachinery for action in various fields of United Nations\r\nactivity.\r\nWith regard to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, there have been unprecedented\r\nqualitative and quantitative changes. As is well known,\r\nthe peace-keeping operations currently being undertaken\r\non four continents, and their mandates, continue to\r\ndiversify — electoral and humanitarian activities, support\r\nfor institutional reconstruction, monitoring of the\r\nobservance of human rights, and so on. At the same time,\r\nnew methods of dealing with crises have been\r\nproposed — for example, stand-by arrangements and\r\nrapid-reaction forces. In this context, we expect that there\r\nwill be a considerable increase in the operational capacity\r\nof the United Nations in the field of the maintenance of\r\npeace, provided that Member States support the adoption\r\nof these new proposals.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nWe support unreservedly the importance the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in his report “An Agenda for Peace”, attaches to\r\nconflict-prevention machinery.\r\nAll these initiatives confirm the preoccupation of the\r\nUnited Nations with regard to the adoption of a coherent\r\napproach to problems of peace and security. At the same\r\ntime, noticeable attention is being paid to the study of\r\ndevelopment topics. The particular interest of Member\r\nStates in the Agenda for Development confirms the\r\ntopicality of these problems and the need to revitalize the\r\nworld Organization in this area.\r\nIn this context, I should like to make the point that, in\r\nview of the interdependence between peace and security, on\r\nthe one hand, and social and economic development, on the\r\nother, it would be worthwhile for the United Nations to\r\ncreate an integrated system for implementation of the\r\nstrategies and polices agreed upon by States. All United\r\nNations activities, including peace-keeping and social and\r\neconomic development programmes, should be\r\ncomplementary. At the same time, the decisions of high-\r\nlevel international conferences should find concrete\r\nexpression in the actions of States and of United Nations\r\nagencies.\r\nIn our opinion, in the attainment of these aims it is\r\nnecessary to avoid excessive politization of certain specific\r\naspects of each field and, at the same time, find the areas\r\nthat are of interest to all Member States. The United\r\nNations system must, through its expertise and global\r\nvision, ensure a climate of cooperation and mutual\r\nconfidence, without which there will be no solutions to the\r\nproblems of peace and development.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova, which is deeply committed\r\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter, is prepared to make its contribution and to support\r\nthe Organization’s efforts to adapt better to the fast and\r\nprofound changes in the modern world. We are fully aware\r\nof the major role of the United Nations in consolidating the\r\npositive trends of recent years in the international arena and\r\nof the need to increase the effectiveness of its activities. We\r\ntherefore welcome the proposals aimed at enhancing that effectiveness.\r\nNaturally, we ourselves are well aware that the\r\nOrganization cannot attain these objectives unless the\r\nMember States put the necessary resources at its disposal.\r\nThat is why we pay special attention to this question and\r\ntry to do our utmost to fulfil our obligations. We consider\r\nit necessary that the responsible United Nations structures\r\nadopt adequate measures to avoid waste, to ensure better\r\nuse of the resources entrusted to it.\r\nIn this context, I want to refer to the problem of\r\ncontributions. I am obliged to point out that for four years\r\nour country has carried the burden of a quota inequitably\r\ncalculated and set at too high a level in relation to its real\r\ncapacity to pay. The artificiality of this calculation is also\r\nproved by the paradox that certain countries at a similar\r\nlevel of development and with populations and territories\r\ntwice or three times larger than ours make contributions\r\nsmaller than or equal to that of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nI imagine that some other recently independent States are\r\nexperiencing the same situation. This, together with the\r\ncosts of transition, could explain our current arrears. We\r\nbelieve that this matter needs to be taken into account at\r\nmeetings of working groups of the General Assembly\r\nwhen they examine the possibility of introducing penalties\r\nagainst the countries that are in arrears.\r\nIn our view, the process of diversifying the relations\r\nand the collaboration between States has enhanced the\r\ndevelopment of regional and subregional cooperation. As\r\na matter of fact, the Charter itself puts particular emphasis\r\non the regional organizations. Documents laying the bases\r\nfor collaboration between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in various fields have been drawn up and\r\nadopted in recent years.\r\nSeveral General Assembly resolutions relating to\r\ncooperation between the United Nations, on the one hand,\r\nand the OSCE, the League of Arab States and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, on the other, are\r\nrelevant in this regard. At present such cooperation is\r\nbecoming increasingly diversified, covering new areas.\r\nSome regional organizations have acquired new\r\ncompetencies, including in the field of peace and security,\r\nand have thereby become partners of the United Nations\r\nin the settlement of some local conflicts. We hope that in\r\nthe near future recently created regional organizations and\r\ngroupings will be able to set up a cooperation framework\r\nwith the United Nations, similar to the one already\r\nexisting with other regional organizations. The Republic\r\nof Moldova thinks this trend should be encouraged.\r\nAt the same time, we consider that any decision of\r\nthe United Nations to transfer various activities within its\r\nsphere of competence to other international organizations,\r\nespecially in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, implies major consequences for the security,\r\nintegrity and independence of States in the respective\r\nregions. That is why the United Nations should continue\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 October 1995\r\nto exercise its competence under Articles 34 and 35 of the\r\nCharter, according to which the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly are the main organs for dealing with and\r\nsettling conflicts having regional implications.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope that\r\nthe proceedings of the fiftieth anniversary session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations will be carried\r\nout in an atmosphere of solidarity, of a realistic and\r\nconstructive approach to the complex issues confronting\r\nthe world at the end of this century. The delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova is prepared to contribute, alongside\r\nother Member States, to the fulfilment of the lofty goals\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\n19\r\n"
