(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, His Excellency Mr.\r\nGlafcos Clerides, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Clerides: I should like to begin by\r\nextending to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. This is not\r\nmerely a recognition of your long experience and your\r\noutstanding ability and diplomatic skill, but also a reflection\r\nof the esteem in which your country, Portugal, is held in\r\nthe United Nations. We are certain that under your able\r\nguidance the work of this very important session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will be a landmark in the history of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nI should also like to pay a warm tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the determined leadership which he has\r\ndemonstrated on vital issues and for his reports on the work\r\nof the Organization, which have already resulted in the\r\nadoption of a series of measures, providing working tools\r\nfor the activities of the United Nations. Cyprus is\r\nparticularly grateful to the Secretary-General and his\r\ndedicated staff for their untiring efforts to find a just and\r\nlasting solution to the question of Cyprus on the basis of\r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nIn April 1945, when it was obvious that the world\r\nwas breaking up into two armed camps, delegates from\r\nthe then independent nations met to create a world\r\norganization capable of building an era of peace and\r\ninternational cooperation out of the chaos and conflict of\r\nthe Second World War. They drafted the United Nations\r\nCharter, a document of principles and norms, aimed at\r\neffectively dealing with aggression and improving human\r\nrights and economic and social conditions for people\r\neverywhere.\r\nFor five decades the spirit of the Charter was kept\r\nalive under very difficult circumstances, even when in\r\nmany cases the United Nations took the blame for the\r\nfailings of its Member States. It is an indisputable fact\r\nthat the United Nations, despite its shortcomings, has\r\nmanaged the transforming of colonies into independent\r\ncountries, restoring democracies and promoting the rule\r\nof law. It has also been successful in resolving conflicts\r\nin many parts of the world — in Namibia, in\r\nMozambique, in Angola, in Cambodia, in Central\r\nAmerica and in the Caribbean — and it has provided the\r\ninspiration for the drafting of major arms-control treaties.\r\nIts peace-keepers have saved thousands of lives, fed\r\n1\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nmillions of people, and helped to restore a degree of\r\nnormality in areas of conflict.\r\nEqually, it has played an important role in promoting\r\nhuman rights and stimulating economic recovery, monetary\r\nstability and growth in the developing world. Furthermore,\r\nover the past 50 years there has been a series of United\r\nNations-inspired conferences which dealt with major issues\r\nthat vitally affect the peoples of the world. More recently,\r\nUnited Nations-sponsored conferences, including the Earth\r\nSummit at Rio, the Vienna World Conference on Human\r\nRights, the Cairo International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, the Copenhagen World Summit for\r\nSocial Development and the Beijing Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, have left their indelible imprint on\r\nthe history of mankind. On the other hand, there have been\r\nreversals — in Rwanda United Nations efforts failed to\r\navert genocide, and in Somalia the tragedy continues.\r\nEqually distressing is the unabated bloodshed in the\r\nBalkans, while United Nations efforts on the problem of my\r\ncountry are still to bear fruit.\r\nFifty years of existence provide an important\r\nopportunity to look back, to reflect on both our successes\r\nand failures. But it is also an opportunity to look forward,\r\nto determine where we can and should go from here,\r\nespecially now, when the cold war, now ended, has\r\nregrettably generated a wide range of security problems\r\nstemming from economic, political or social tensions or\r\nissues of nationalism. The complex nature of the challenges\r\ncalls for multilateral action and an integrated approach.\r\nDrawing from the lessons of the past and the challenges of\r\nthe present, we must open up new ways to use the\r\nmechanisms provided originally by the Charter.\r\nIn this context, the continuing debate on the Agenda\r\nfor Peace has stimulated new thinking about the particular\r\nchanges needed to re-equip the United Nations for its role\r\nin this field, so as to vindicate the vision of its founders.\r\nFrom this rostrum I have had the opportunity to present in\r\nsome detail our views on the proposed conceptual\r\norientations. I do not need to stress that my country is fully\r\ncommitted to these goals. The recent history of Cyprus can\r\nbe seen as a case study, demonstrating the need for such an\r\ninitiative and the importance of further expanding its\r\nconcepts.\r\nUnder the United Nations Charter disarmament and\r\narms control are integral parts of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Though for decades progress towards disarmament\r\nand arms control was made impossible by the rigidities of\r\nbipolarization, the latter’s demise has now opened up new\r\npossibilities.\r\nIn the last two years we have witnessed major\r\nachievements, the most important of which was the\r\ndecision to extend indefinitely and unconditionally the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\r\nalong with the strengthening of the review process for the\r\nTreaty and the adoption of a set of principles and\r\nobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\r\nFurthermore, we will soon be entering into commitments\r\nfor the conclusion of the comprehensive test-ban treaty\r\nand the negotiation of a treaty banning the production of\r\nfissile material for nuclear purposes. These should be seen\r\nas products of the momentum which has built up in the\r\ndisarmament field since the end of the cold war. We\r\nshare the view that much still needs to be done in the\r\nareas of both non-conventional and conventional weapons,\r\nfor, as long as military threats to security exist, the\r\ndisarmament and arms-control process will continue to be\r\nan essential element of international security.\r\nThe reduction of forces and armaments alone cannot\r\nprovide for or guarantee international security, but it can\r\nreduce the risk of an outbreak of military conflict and can\r\ncontribute to confidence-building and conflict resolution.\r\nIn this context, I would like to remind this body of my\r\nproposal for the complete demilitarization of the Republic\r\nof Cyprus: the withdrawal of the Turkish occupation\r\nforces, the disbanding of the National Guard of Cyprus,\r\nthe handing over of all its arms and military equipment to\r\nthe custody of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force\r\nand the placing into a United Nations account of all\r\nmoney saved from the purchase of arms, to be used for\r\ninfrastructure development projects beneficial to both\r\ncommunities. I feel that our proposal reflects not only our\r\ngood intentions but also the spirit of the times.\r\nUnfortunately, it was rejected by Turkey.\r\nGenuine security also includes economic well-being,\r\nprotection of human rights and environmental\r\nsustainability. All these dimensions function together, in\r\nan interlocking and mutually reinforcing way, as\r\nfoundations of peace. There is much concern today that\r\nthe United Nations should have an agenda and working\r\nmethod of direct relevance to the economic and social\r\nneeds of societies in which individuals or groups are\r\ndeprived of their freedom or of the basic necessities on\r\nwhich human life depends. Newspapers and television\r\nscreens air these needs daily. The international\r\ncommunity’s ability to offer a decent and secure existence\r\nto all its citizens is called into question by the numerous\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nhuman tragedies, atrocities of war, terrorism, traffic in\r\nillegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our\r\nplanet.\r\nIt is self-evident that global cooperation and effective\r\naction is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and\r\nother evils tormenting world society. Our most important\r\ngoal must be the implementation of our existing\r\ncommitments, as provided for in the Charter. In placing the\r\nemphasis on this, we are setting no modest objective. What\r\nwe should recognize is that the body of principles and\r\ncommitments which have been built up over the last 50\r\nyears cover the full range of civil, political, economic and\r\nsocial issues.\r\nOur task should be to reduce the obvious gap between\r\naccepted principles and everyday practice, to apply these\r\nprinciples without discrimination and at the same time to\r\nconsider ways of strengthening further the existing\r\nmechanisms. In this context, we must face up to the\r\nproblem of holding to full account those who flout the\r\nauthority of the United Nations, persistently refuse to\r\nrespect the rights of others and choose to disregard the\r\ninternational commitments which they have freely accepted.\r\nWhen I speak of the need to uphold the authority of\r\nthe United Nations, I feel entitled to use as an example the\r\nexperience of my country and its people. Since 1974, when\r\nTurkish forces invaded Cyprus, 37 per cent of the territory\r\nof the Republic has remained under military occupation by\r\nTurkey. The Turkish occupation troops, instead of\r\nwithdrawing after repeated calls by solemn Security Council\r\nand General Assembly resolutions, are increasing in number\r\nand modernizing their military equipment, thus posing not\r\nonly a serious threat to the security of our region but also\r\na challenge to the authority of the United Nations. The\r\nSecretary-General has stated in his reports to the Security\r\nCouncil that the area of Cyprus under occupation by the\r\nTurkish forces is the most militarized area in the world.\r\nAnother point of particular concern to us is the\r\nmassive violation of the human rights of the displaced\r\npersons who were forcibly evicted from their homes by the\r\nTurkish occupation forces and whose homes and property\r\nhave been usurped by illegal settlers imported from Turkey\r\nto Cyprus in an effort to change the demographic\r\ncomposition of our population and colonize the part of\r\nCyprus occupied by the Turkish forces. All these flagrant\r\nhuman rights violations have been committed against my\r\ncountry despite a number of General Assembly and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions calling on all States to respect\r\nthe sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity\r\nof the Republic of Cyprus and to avoid any actions which\r\ncould change the demographic structure of the island.\r\nTurkey’s defiance extends also to resolutions calling\r\nfor the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Republic of\r\nCyprus, the return of the refugees to their homes under\r\nconditions of safety, the humanitarian issues of the\r\nmissing persons and the implementation of the third\r\nVienna agreement, regarding the living conditions and\r\nwelfare of persons in enclaves in areas under the control\r\nof the Turkish occupation forces.\r\nOn this solemn occasion, I wish sincerely to express,\r\non behalf of the people of Cyprus, the Government and\r\nmyself, deep appreciation for the solidarity offered us by\r\nthe Assembly. I ask that its most valuable support be\r\nreinforced with added emphasis, for it is high time the\r\nresolutions of the United Nations on Cyprus were\r\nimplemented if a just and lasting solution is to be arrived\r\nat without further delay. We must remember that failure\r\nto uphold international law and respect for human rights\r\nin one situation sets a precedent for similar failures\r\nelsewhere, with often catastrophic consequences. Recent\r\nexperiences have demonstrated this all too blatantly.\r\nAt every turning point in modern history, nations\r\nconvene to shape a new world order. This is another such\r\nhistoric turning point, and the United Nations is the forum\r\nfor the world order we must build. We have, I believe, a\r\ncollective responsibility to understand the nature of the\r\nnew, post-cold-war role of the United Nations, to continue\r\nour effort towards the institutional reforms needed to re-\r\nequip the United Nations for its role and to make\r\ncommitments of the human and financial resources\r\nnecessary for the United Nations to carry out effectively\r\nits mission. We believe that the topics of prime\r\nconsideration should include the restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council, the system of international security as\r\nprovided for in the Charter, the further development and\r\nimplementation of the basic concepts of An Agenda for\r\nPeace and An Agenda for Development and the finances\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIt is now generally accepted that the Security\r\nCouncil’s membership must be increased so as to become\r\nmore representative of the Organization’s membership. It\r\nis also recognized that it has to improve the effectiveness\r\nof its decision-making to deal with the challenges of\r\ninternational security in the future. Openness in its\r\nproceedings, democratization in its decision-taking\r\nprocedures, and broader consultation by the permanent\r\nmembers with non-permanent members and with those\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\noutside the Council whose interests are affected by a\r\nparticular issue before it, will contribute to the effectiveness\r\nof this all-important United Nations body.\r\nOn the other hand, we should ensure that the General\r\nAssembly, the universal organ of the United Nations, where\r\nthe sovereign equality of Member States is democratically\r\ndepicted, be fully respected and utilized more, if we are to\r\nserve well the peoples of the world.\r\nIt is of paramount importance to recognize that, for\r\npeace and stability to be maintained and for democracy to\r\nbe rooted, economic and social development is\r\nindispensable. That is why we welcome the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to answer social and economic problems,\r\nthough the United Nations was created primarily as a\r\npolitical body to address political issues. Today, however,\r\nmore than ever, we must face social and economic\r\nchallenges, for it is not enough to bring forth the end of\r\nstrife and violence. It has been correctly said that if we\r\ncontain violence but ignore poverty we will sooner or later\r\ndiscover that we have simply traded one misery for another.\r\nThe historic Middle East accord offers a good example\r\nin this respect, where what has been achieved in the course\r\nof the peace process should be cemented by the economic\r\nsupport of the international community, thus ensuring a just\r\nand lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nNever in the history of mankind has the awareness of\r\ninterdependence and globalism been so strong as it is today,\r\nand never has mankind had so much technological know-\r\nhow at its disposal. Building upon the accumulation of 50\r\nyears of United Nations experience in multilateral relations\r\nand the everlasting principles and ideals of the United\r\nNations Charter, we can and must do everything within our\r\npower to bequeath to coming generations a better world,\r\nwhere security, democracy, human rights and prosperity\r\nprevail and are shared by all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Cyprus for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Lesotho, His Excellency, the Honourable Mr.\r\nKelebone Maope.\r\nMr. Maope (Lesotho): Mr. President, it affords me\r\ngreat pleasure to congratulate you on your election to\r\ndirect the work of this historic session of the General\r\nAssembly. Such an honour bears testimony to your\r\nundoubted dynamism and diplomatic skills, which will in\r\nno small measure bear on the outcome of the work of this\r\nAssembly.\r\nPermit me also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, of Cote d’Ivoire, for his\r\noutstanding leadership of the forty-ninth session. We\r\ncongratulate him also on the many initiatives that he took\r\nin the furtherance of the work of our Organization.\r\nLastly, may I refer to the sterling work that the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali, continues\r\nto do against great odds. His report on the work of the\r\nOrganization in 1995 has painted in sharp relief the\r\nawesome task that faces us at the threshold of a new\r\nmillennium and as we enter the second half-century of the\r\nUnited Nations existence.\r\nThe United Nations has been, and will always be,\r\nthe symbol of humankind’s fervent desire to conduct its\r\naffairs with the purpose of eternal survival. When the\r\ndark clouds of war threatened to engulf the world with a\r\ncatastrophe of unimaginable proportions, humankind\r\nfound strength within itself to negate the Armageddon.\r\nThe pattern of large-scale wars involving many nations\r\nhas been reversed, and the worst that we suffered in\r\nrecent years was a cold war that was more\r\npsychologically than physically damaging. Happily, that\r\nis now behind us.\r\nBut, even as we stop to ponder and reflect on the\r\npast, a new pattern of ethnic intra-State conflagrations has\r\nemerged and continues to threaten the very survival of\r\nhumanity. This new scenario has posed a serious\r\nchallenge to the initiatives and peace-keeping capabilities\r\nof our Organization.\r\nThe record of the United Nations in the recent past\r\nin peace-keeping has been mixed. We have had\r\nunqualified successes in some places, but then in others\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nsuccess has eluded us. Our resolve, therefore, has to be to\r\nshift the balance in favour of greater success. Our\r\nmachinery for peacemaking and peace-keeping needs to be\r\nfine-tuned to maximum precision. The implications of this\r\nrequirement are far-reaching and need to be appreciated in\r\ntheir amplitude.\r\nFirst, the financing of peace-keeping operations must\r\nbe put on a more secure footing. Persistent arrears, such as\r\nthose we are currently experiencing, especially when they\r\nare incurred by major Powers, cannot but have an adverse\r\neffect on the morale of the small countries, such as my\r\nown, that make great sacrifices to meet their obligations to\r\nthe Organization.\r\nSecondly, greater attention should be paid to peace-\r\nmaking and preventive diplomacy, thereby reducing the\r\nprospects of conflicts, with their attendant costs. In this\r\nregard, the ideas contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nSupplement to An Agenda for Peace merit our close\r\nattention. The strategy of pre-empting the eruption of\r\nconflict is, of course, closely linked to the United Nations\r\nefforts in the fields of social and economic development,\r\nbecause it is in the soil of poverty that the seeds of national\r\nupheavals take root and sprout.\r\nLast, but not least, the changed nature of the\r\nchallenges facing the Security Council call for the\r\nrestructuring of that organ to reflect the changed realities of\r\npresent-day international relations. All the international\r\npeace-and-security matters of which the Council is currently\r\nseized pertain to developing countries or countries in\r\ntransition. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council should include an\r\nappropriate proportion of developing countries in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories.\r\nMy delegation therefore supports the view that the\r\nreform of the Security Council should be in accordance\r\nwith the following principles: one, the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council must not put in danger its effectiveness,\r\nbut, on the contrary, should strengthen it; two, the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council should enhance its\r\nrepresentative character, taking into account the emergence\r\nof new economic and political Powers as well as the\r\nincrease of United Nations membership; three, the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council should enhance\r\nequitable geographic representation; four, the possibility of\r\nsmaller Member States serving on the Security Council\r\nshould not be diminished; and, lastly, the enlargement\r\nshould take place in both categories of permanent and non-\r\npermanent members.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council has continued to\r\naddress the question of the reform of the Council. It is\r\nencouraging to note that discussions have shown a general\r\nsupport for the need to increase the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, especially of developing countries, and\r\na subsequent need to review the Council’s composition.\r\nThe general view is that the size and composition of an\r\nexpanded Council should reflect more accurately the\r\nuniversal character of the United Nations and present-day\r\nrealities.\r\nIt has further been recognized that the principle of\r\nthe sovereign equality of all Members of the United\r\nNations and the concepts of equitable representation and\r\ndistribution, legitimacy, effectiveness and efficiency\r\nshould serve as guiding principles for the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nA number of political questions continue to\r\npreoccupy us. In this regard, the leaders and people of\r\nIsrael, Jordan and Palestine deserve our congratulations\r\non having transformed the hopes and goals embodied in\r\nthe Middle East peace process into tangible achievements.\r\nThe people of Israel and the Palestinians have overcome\r\nformidable obstacles. Yet the most difficult and divisive\r\nissues still remain unresolved.\r\nThe peace process in that area of the Middle East is\r\nof the utmost importance and must therefore be negotiated\r\nagainst a backdrop of continuing and satisfactory\r\nprogress. Only that will help give both Israel and\r\nPalestine the further confidence needed to make the\r\npolitical decisions that will ultimately achieve a lasting\r\nsolution.\r\nWe also need to urge the international community to\r\nrespond quickly, appropriately, generously, practically and\r\nflexibly to the needs of the Palestinian people.\r\nAchievements must match expectations.\r\nIn the tragic situation of the former Yugoslavia, the\r\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be\r\ncommended for accepting the peace proposal of the five-\r\nnation Contact Group, which has been endorsed by the\r\nSecurity Council. This peace proposal, as recent\r\ndevelopments have indicated, does not sufficiently\r\nrespond to the requirements of justice and equity, but we\r\nare none the less encouraged by a number of positive\r\ndevelopments that have taken place.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nWe therefore urge the international community, in\r\nparticular, the Security Council and the member States of\r\nthe European Contact Group, to respond effectively to the\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We hope that the\r\nlogic of peace will finally overcome the logic of war, on\r\nthe basis of the cease-fire, which is yet to come into effect.\r\nIn Africa, many significant developments have taken\r\nplace in respect of peace-keeping that have to be\r\nunderstood in the context of changes in the international\r\nenvironment. The changes include the fatigue and\r\nreluctance of the leading world Powers, especially those in\r\nthe Security Council, to participate in peace-keeping\r\noperations in Africa. That reluctance was exemplified by\r\nthe events in Burundi, where the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) had to deploy a limited observation mission\r\nbecause the United Nations could not.\r\nOn the other hand, however, some of the Western\r\ncountries have launched several initiatives aimed at\r\nidentifying ways in which the international community can\r\nassist Africa to cope with the challenges of conflict\r\nprevention and management. While Africa, in keeping with\r\nits determination to combat conflicts on the continent, is\r\nappreciative of these gestures from its outside partners, we\r\nwish to remind the international community of the United\r\nNations primary role as the guardian of world peace and\r\nstability everywhere, including in Africa. Africa remains\r\npart of the international community, and the notion that\r\n“African problems need an African solution”, as some\r\ncountries advocate, is erroneous. The determination of\r\nAfrica to address, through the OAU, the problem of\r\nconflicts on the continent should not be misconstrued as\r\nabsolving the United Nations from its responsibility for\r\npeace and security where Africa is concerned.\r\nThe Sahraoui people have a right to self-determination.\r\nWe therefore appeal to all parties to respect the decision to\r\nhold a referendum in Western Sahara, to be held as\r\nscheduled in January 1996.\r\nMy delegation believes that the key to attaining\r\nnuclear disarmament and a nuclear-free world continues to\r\nbe the universality of the non-proliferation regime. In this\r\nconnection, therefore, I wish to register my delegation’s\r\nstrong rejection of nuclear tests, which are clearly\r\ninconsistent with the decision of the Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regarding the\r\nprinciples and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament, which committed all States to work towards\r\nthe elimination of nuclear weapons and to exercise the\r\nutmost restraint with respect to nuclear testing. We call\r\non all nuclear-weapon States to refrain from any further\r\ntesting.\r\nWe express our deep disappointment at the lack of\r\nconcrete results on the question of the review and\r\nappraisal of the implementation of the declaration of the\r\n1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade.\r\nIt is important to note that at its forty-ninth session\r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 49/75 B of 15\r\nDecember 1994, in which it decided to undertake, at its\r\nfiftieth session, such a review and appraisal. The\r\nAssembly requested the Disarmament Commission, at its\r\n1995 session, to make a preliminary assessment of the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration and of suggestions that\r\nmight be put forth to ensure appropriate progress. We\r\nregret to note that despite extensive efforts to agree on\r\nconsensus language, there was a divergence of views and\r\nit was not possible to reach a consensus. It is\r\ndisappointing to note that delegations were not willing to\r\nengage in serious negotiations to find even small areas of\r\ncommon ground.\r\nIn recent decades the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) has also adopted a number of other resolutions on\r\ndisarmament and on the denuclearization of the African\r\ncontinent. Convinced that the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones can contribute to the strengthening of\r\nthe international non-proliferation regime, the sixtieth\r\nordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers\r\nadopted a resolution in which the OAU Secretary-General\r\nwas requested to convene a joint meeting of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity inter-governmental group\r\nof experts and the Group of Experts to Prepare a Draft\r\nTreaty on an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone set up\r\njointly by the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nUnited Nations. This initiative needs the unrelenting\r\nsupport of the international community, in particular that\r\nof the nuclear-weapon States, through their accession to\r\nthe protocols that concern them in connection with the\r\nreduction and prohibition of the use and testing of all\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nMy Government, like the Governments of all African\r\nStates, is convinced that the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones worldwide, through the encouragement\r\nof the United Nations — especially in the Middle East, as\r\nalready proposed by Egypt — would enhance the security\r\nof Africa and the subsequent viability of the African\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nIn the social and human rights field, the United\r\nNations continues to make some progress. The World\r\nSummit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen in\r\nMarch, was a milestone in humankind’s quest for consensus\r\non universal standards for social development. The\r\nimplementation of the undertakings which the Heads of\r\nState or Government made needs to be monitored closely\r\nin order to assess the degree of progress being made in\r\nachieving those undertakings. In this regard, the 20/20\r\ncompact is an important step in the direction of\r\ninternational collaboration to achieve balanced development\r\nof the social sector. It is the intention of my Government to\r\nfulfil its commitment to allocate 20 per cent of its\r\ndevelopment budgetary allocation to the social sector; we\r\nexpect our development partners to meet us half way in this\r\nendeavour.\r\nThe outcome of the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen is still very fresh in our minds, having been\r\nachieved only a few weeks ago. Although it was\r\nunfortunate that some countries found it necessary to enter\r\nreservations in respect of certain paragraphs of the Platform\r\nfor Action, we are encouraged that a significant step\r\nforward was taken towards the goal of recognizing the right\r\nof women to be equal partners with men and to have\r\ncomplete control over all aspects of their lives. The triple\r\ngoals of equality, development and peace, enunciated 20\r\nyears ago in Mexico City, underscore the undeniable truth\r\nthat development and peace are not feasible while half of\r\nthe world’s population is discriminated against and not\r\nallowed to realize its full potential. My delegation reaffirms\r\nour Government’s determination to forge ahead with vigour\r\nwith the implementation of the Platform for Action until the\r\nfull emancipation of women is attained. In this connection,\r\nI should like to call for an early follow-up and review\r\nconference lest the momentum generated in Beijing be lost.\r\nThere is a widely held myth that the developing world\r\nis experiencing a high growth rate because of the\r\nremarkable economic performance of East Asia. How can\r\nthis be true when a total of 47 developing countries\r\nclassified as least-developed countries continue to fight for\r\nsurvival? These countries account for 10 per cent of the\r\nworld’s population but earn only 0.1 per cent of the global\r\nincome. For over two decades now, they have continued to\r\nexperience serious declines in per capita income. Their\r\nshare of world trade has declined from 0.6 per cent in 1980\r\nto 0.2 per cent in 1992.\r\nAfrica continues to be the region most in need of help.\r\nThe 1995 economic growth indicators, however, present an\r\nencouraging picture. For the first time in over six years, the\r\neconomic-growth rate is projected to match the\r\npopulation-growth rate, which is, unfortunately, the\r\nhighest in the world.\r\nAfrica has been used over the past 20 years, and is\r\nstill being used, as a policy laboratory for the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. It is regrettable that today, as the\r\nUnited Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the\r\nsigning of the Organization’s Charter in San Francisco,\r\nmany people in Africa continue to live under even harsher\r\nconditions of poverty, hunger, disease, civil war and\r\nnatural disaster. The plight of the African continent\r\nremains a major challenge for the emerging world order.\r\nThere is an urgent need for a stronger consolidated effort\r\nto pull the continent out of the poverty trap into which it\r\ncontinues to sink.\r\nA few months ago at Geneva, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, at the high-level segment of its 1995\r\nsubstantive session, deliberated an item entitled “The\r\ndevelopment of Africa, including the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s”. The high-level segment recognized\r\nthat, among all the five regions of the world, Africa\r\ncontinues to be the only one lagging far behind in terms\r\nof development and that it remains the most marginalized\r\nin the world economy.\r\nAllow me at this juncture to take this opportunity to\r\napplaud the Government of National Unity of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa for having embarked on a\r\nreconstruction and development programme as a strategy\r\nfor tackling the thorny issue of the economic imbalances\r\ncreated by the policies of apartheid. It is important for the\r\ninternational community to realize that the entire southern\r\nAfrican subregion was as much affected and that it still\r\nsuffers from the impact of the apartheid legacy. Any\r\ninternational support for the implementation of the\r\nreconstruction and development programme in South\r\nAfrica should take this fact into account.\r\nThe southern African States members of the\r\nSouthern African Development Community continue to\r\npay priority attention to closer and stronger integration of\r\ntheir economies. The international community should\r\nmake its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are\r\nadequately supported through complementary financial\r\nand technological support, including improved terms of\r\ntrade, increased flows of direct foreign investment and\r\nappropriate debt relief measures.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nLesotho, as a land-locked and least developed country,\r\nattaches great importance to issues of concern to the least\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly their transit transport\r\nproblems. We welcome the adoption by the\r\nintergovernmental meeting of the land-locked and transit\r\ndeveloping countries, donor countries and financial\r\ninstitutions of a framework for cooperation to alleviate\r\ntransit transport problems of the land-locked States and of\r\ntheir transit neighbours. It is our sincere belief that this\r\nsession of the General Assembly will seriously address\r\nitself to the provisions of this framework, with a view to\r\nspeeding up their implementation.\r\nThe Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries for the 1990s remains largely unimplemented.\r\nLesotho, as a least developed country, is seriously\r\nconcerned about this.\r\nIn Lesotho, as in many other countries in Africa and\r\nother regions, we have undertaken far-reaching political\r\nreforms, thus heeding the international clarion call to\r\nrestore democratic administration, popular participation,\r\naccountability and good governance. These reforms have\r\nbeen undertaken amidst painful but necessary structural\r\nadjustment programmes intended to improve our\r\nmacroeconomic policies and structures. The international\r\ncommunity needs to realize that the success and\r\nsustainability of all these reforms cannot be guaranteed\r\nunless they bring about tangible results and satisfy the\r\nexpectations of our people, particularly the most\r\ndisadvantaged.\r\nOur cooperating partners, in the forefront of advocates\r\nof democratic rule, seem to be relinquishing their\r\nresponsibility of seeing to it that democratic institutions are\r\nsustained. In most of our countries our fledgling\r\ndemocracies face the serious challenge posed by lack of\r\nresources initially promised by our friends. We see\r\nemerging in each of our countries pockets of discontent\r\nwhich in essence challenge and destabilize the very shaky\r\nfoundations of our young democracies. We in Lesotho\r\nunderstand very well the complementarity of democracy\r\nand development, and it is on this basis that we call upon\r\nour partners to carry out as a matter of urgency their\r\ninternational responsibility, particularly in this area.\r\nFor two consecutive years now, Lesotho has been\r\nexperiencing an unprecedented devastating drought, which\r\nhas adversely affected food production. This year the\r\nquantity of acreage cultivated was substantially reduced,\r\ndue to lack of rainfall. As a result of the drought, the\r\nGovernment had to declare a state of food emergency and\r\nsend urgent appeals to our traditional and new food\r\ndonors for a helping hand. Unfortunately, not very\r\nencouraging responses have so far been received. It is\r\ntherefore my humble duty and responsibility to renew this\r\nappeal to the international community through the\r\nAssembly.\r\nToday’s world is increasingly being made smaller\r\nand smaller by technological advances. Developments in\r\none part of the world are of direct relevance and interest\r\nto other parts of the world. Closer cooperation and\r\ncollaboration between partners is more urgently needed\r\nthan ever before. South-South cooperation has to be\r\nfurther strengthened and universalized. In this regard, the\r\nimportance of triangular arrangements for promoting and\r\nexpanding South-South cooperation cannot be over-\r\nemphasized. Furthermore, increased transfer of modern\r\nproductive and efficient technologies is a necessary\r\ncondition for all the nations of the world to be able to\r\nfulfil their obligations and commitment to leave man’s\r\ncommon heritage — the Earth — in a condition that will\r\nenable future generations to sustain life on it.\r\nMany of us are doing our best to develop the full\r\npotential of our human resources through education, good\r\nhealth, a clean living and working environment and\r\nnutrition. We have put in place appropriate policies to\r\nensure the realization of this noble objective. We are\r\nworried about slow progress towards the discovery of a\r\npermanent cure for the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and would\r\nurge all humankind not to spare any effort or resources\r\nuntil this menace has been vanquished. We therefore join\r\nthe appeals for increased political commitment and\r\nfinancial and material support for scientific and other\r\nresearch that will lead to the discovery of a cure for this\r\ndisease.\r\nFor a long time the nations of the world have\r\nexpressed their desire to enhance the international justice\r\nsystem. The recognition that an international criminal\r\ncourt was an essential element in building respect for\r\nhuman rights throughout the world led the Members of\r\nthe United Nations nearly half a century ago to pledge to\r\ncreate a new system of international justice. Progress in\r\nthis regard has, however, been slow.\r\nThe atrocities in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda\r\nprovided an impetus to establish a permanent international\r\ncriminal court. Lesotho supports the view that a\r\npermanent international criminal court should be\r\nestablished by 1996. We believe that the most practical\r\nmethod of establishing such a court is by a multilateral\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\ntreaty that would enter into force following ratification by\r\na reasonable number of States. It is our fervent belief that\r\nsuch a court would be the living embodiment of the\r\nfundamental principles of international criminal law.\r\nBesides being able to hold individual perpetrators of human\r\nrights violations personally liable, the court would\r\ncomplement prosecutions in national courts by acting when\r\nStates were unwilling or unable to bring perpetrators to\r\njustice.\r\nThe commendable efforts of the International Law\r\nCommission in preparing the draft statute for the court are\r\nto be applauded. It now remains for Governments and other\r\norgans of civil society to strengthen the draft statute to\r\nensure that it is a model of justice, fairness and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Jordan, His Excellency Mr. Abdul-Karim\r\nKabariti.\r\nMr. Kabariti (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to begin my statement by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, and on the Government and people\r\nof your country, Portugal, on your election as President of\r\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly, which\r\ncoincides with the Golden Jubilee of the United Nations. I\r\nam confident that, with your skill and expertise in\r\ndiplomacy and international affairs, you will be able to\r\nsteer the deliberations of this session most efficiently and\r\ncompetently.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI should like also to extend deep appreciation to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, for successfully conducting the affairs of the forty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nAllow me also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his sincere,\r\nincessant and dedicated efforts in the service of the\r\ninternational community through this Organization.\r\nOver the past few years, the world order has witnessed\r\nradical changes in its structure that have entailed\r\ndevelopments some of which have been positive while\r\nothers have been negative. On the positive side, wide-\r\nranging developments have been seen in many States with\r\nregard to the emergence of democracy, political plurality,\r\nrespect for human rights and basic freedoms. Such\r\ndevelopments have been accompanied by a natural\r\nyearning for the achievement of development in both its\r\neconomic and social domains, while developments on the\r\nnegative side have generated a wider cycle of racial,\r\nnational and religious disputes in some regions of the\r\nworld that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect\r\nfor human rights and basic freedoms of the human\r\nindividual, as well as regression of development both in\r\nthe economic and social spheres. The primary task of this\r\nOrganization at this point in time is, perhaps, to focus on\r\nstrengthening the first tendency and to limit, as much as\r\npossible, the second.\r\nIn the face of such a challenge, the task of reforming\r\nthe United Nations should be met with a view to\r\nstrengthening its role, making it more effective and\r\nachieving a qualitative transformation of the work of its\r\norgans. The Security Council stands in need of\r\nrestructuring with a view to increasing its membership in\r\nsuch a way as to reflect balanced representation of\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. The present\r\ncomposition of the Council, as it took shape in the wake\r\nof World War II, no longer reflects the present balance of\r\npower in its broader sense. Any expansion of the\r\npermanent membership of the Council should take into\r\naccount the inclusion of countries from the developing\r\nworld which have significant political, economic and\r\ndemographic weight.\r\nOn the other hand, the veto prerogative of the five\r\npermanent Member States should be reviewed and certain\r\nCouncil mechanisms must be substantively reformed as in\r\nthe case of the mechanism relating to economic sanctions.\r\nReform of that mechanism should ensure: firstly, limiting\r\nas much as possible the impact of sanctions on the\r\ncivilian population of the country on which the sanctions\r\nare imposed, and secondly, compensating third States that\r\nare affected by the sanctions in proportion to the damage\r\nsustained by them.\r\nIt is also necessary to achieve the universality of the\r\nUnited Nations in conformity with Article 4, paragraph 1,\r\nof the Charter, which stipulates that membership in the\r\nUnited Nations is open to all peace-loving nations which\r\naccept the obligations contained in the Charter.\r\nMembership should not be denied on the basis of any\r\npolitical or other considerations.\r\nPeace-keeping operations have become the corner-\r\nstone of the overall work and activities of the United\r\nNations. While my country, Jordan, prides itself on its\r\nwide-ranging participation in the operations, it deems it\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nnecessary to continue the process of comprehensively\r\nreviewing peace-keeping operations in the light of the\r\nwidening scope and number of such operations, as well as\r\nthe diverse nature of the tasks undertaken by the peace-\r\nkeepers and the dangers they are exposed to.\r\nAt the same time, we emphasize the need to\r\nstrengthen the efforts made to consolidate the foundations\r\nand bases of preventive diplomacy which aims to avert the\r\nbreak-out or escalation of conflicts, in addition to\r\ndeveloping the machinery for post-conflict peacemaking and\r\npeace-building.\r\nAs for the financial crisis which has impacted on\r\npeace-keeping operations, that crisis not only affects proper\r\nimplementation and the level of performance, but affects\r\nalso the participation of many developing countries in those\r\noperations. Those countries have now become reluctant to\r\nparticipate because they have not been reimbursed on time.\r\nIf such a situation persists, it may impact adversely on the\r\ndesired comprehensive international character of the\r\nstructure of peace-keeping troops and lead to the exclusion\r\nof developing countries therefrom, thus restricting\r\nparticipation to the developed countries that are financially\r\nable to bear the cost of their participation.\r\nThe only solution to this problem is for all countries\r\nto meet their financial obligations on time, particularly\r\nthose countries that contribute the bulk of the United\r\nNations budget. Jordan has supported the establishment of\r\na special fund to help start new operations whenever\r\nneeded. Part of the capital of this fund should be earmarked\r\nfor the reimbursement of the developing countries that\r\nparticipate in such operations. In this regard, we feel that\r\namendments need to be made to the reimbursement\r\nmechanism, so that the developing countries contributing\r\ntroops to peace-keeping operations may be reimbursed on\r\na priority basis.\r\nThe end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued the\r\nworld during the cold war and the disappearance of the\r\nideological demarcation line that divided the world into two\r\ncamps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunity\r\nafforded us by the current transitional period to lay down\r\nnew foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrow\r\nthe economic gap between them. The first step in that\r\ndirection may well be to find substantive and meaningful\r\nsolutions to the problem of the accumulated debts of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWhile my country welcomed the establishment of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization and has applied for membership,\r\nwe call for an in-depth study of the foundations and\r\ncontrols upon which freedom of trade is built. We also\r\ncall for a review of the strategies of economic\r\ndevelopment at the international level, with a view to\r\nimproving them in conformity with the principles of\r\nsustainable development and to achieve the cherished goal\r\nof environmental conservation.\r\nWhile world peace and stability are among the most\r\nimportant prerequisites for economic development and of\r\nthe social development it entails, the development cycle,\r\nhowever, will not be complete without consolidating the\r\nunderpinnings of democracy and social justice which lead\r\nto further development and thereby promote peace and\r\nstability.\r\nProceeding from His Majesty King Hussein’s belief\r\nin the close relationship between peace, democracy and\r\ndevelopment, Jordan’s earnest participation in the peace\r\nprocess went hand in hand with the strengthening of\r\ndemocracy and the consolidation of political plurality in\r\nJordan. As is known, the peace process which started in\r\nMadrid four years ago has resulted, inter alia, in the\r\nconclusion of the Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which\r\nrestored to Jordan all its territorial and water rights and\r\nlaid the foundation for a balanced relationship based on\r\nmutual and equal interests between Israel and Jordan.\r\nThis, of course, reflects positively on the peace, stability\r\nand welfare of the peoples of the region.\r\nEfforts are now under way to bring about a huge\r\nqualitative jump in regional economic development in the\r\nMiddle East. The States of the region are showing great\r\ninterest in the Amman Economic Summit, which is\r\nscheduled to be held at the end of this month, October\r\n1995, within the framework of regional cooperation, as a\r\nproduct of the multilateral track of the peace process.\r\nJordan looks forward with optimism to the\r\nforthcoming Barcelona Conference with the aim of\r\nestablishing a partnership that joins together the\r\nMediterranean States. This would contribute to the\r\nconsolidation of the comprehensive peace process in the\r\nMiddle East. In this respect, I should like to express deep\r\ngratitude and appreciation for the role played by Europe,\r\nJapan and other States involved in the multilateral track\r\nof the peace process which, together with the United\r\nStates of America, support the development efforts in\r\nJordan and of peace-building in the region.\r\nJordan’s participation in the multilateral track of the\r\npeace process stems from its conviction that it is\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nnecessary to find effective solutions to the problems that\r\nhave accumulated over the many years of the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict. Foremost among those problems is the question of\r\nrefugees. In this regard, we commend the outstanding role\r\nplayed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), stress the\r\nimportance of that role and of the essential services the\r\nAgency provides for the refugees. Accordingly, my country,\r\nas host to the largest number of refugees, feels that it is\r\nnecessary for UNRWA’s work to continue and indeed for\r\nthe services it provides to be expanded. This, in turn,\r\nnecessitates the strengthening of UNRWA’s budget, until a\r\nfinal solution to the refugee problem is reached through\r\nreturn and compensation, as provided for in the United\r\nNations resolutions and principles of international law.\r\nTherefore, while we acknowledge the donor States’\r\ncontributions, we call upon them, from this rostrum, to\r\ncontinue to contribute to UNRWA’s budget, so that this\r\nnoble goal may be achieved.\r\nOn the other hand, my country supports all efforts to\r\nadvance the negotiations on other bilateral tracks in order\r\nto realize the principle of “the return of land for peace” on\r\nthe basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973) and 425 (1978), which constitute the essential terms\r\nof reference for the peace process.\r\nOn this occasion, I should like to commend the very\r\nimportant development on the Palestinian-Israeli track with\r\nthe conclusion of the Taba Agreement on the expansion of\r\nself-government in the West Bank and the subsequent\r\nsigning of that agreement in Washington, D.C., on 28\r\nSeptember 1995.\r\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\r\nJordan’s full support for the Palestinian National Authority\r\nin its sincere efforts to achieve the goals of a just and\r\ndurable peace in the region. We believe that those efforts\r\nwill lead to the establishment of the independent State of\r\nPalestine, with the holy city of Al-Quds as its capital, in\r\nrealization of the hopes and aspirations of the brotherly\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nMy delegation did not spare any effort during the 1995\r\nReview and Extension Conference of the States Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) in order for the Conference to produce positive\r\nresults that would buttress this treaty which is a major\r\ncornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime,\r\nand may bring about its universality by the accession\r\nthereto of all States, including Israel, and the placement of\r\nits nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, as well as the\r\nprovision of adequate security guarantees for non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States.\r\nIn addition to the decision to extend the treaty\r\nindefinitely and to strengthen the review process, the\r\nConference also adopted a resolution on the Middle East\r\nwhich called, inter alia, for taking the necessary measures\r\nto establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.\r\nJordan has participated actively and in good faith in\r\nall the regional talks concerning arms control and regional\r\nsecurity within the multilateral track of the peace process.\r\nWe hope that these talks will achieve their goals, namely,\r\nthe prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and an end to the regional arms race in the\r\narea of conventional weapons. These efforts have started\r\nto bear fruit recently with the decision to establish three\r\nregional security centres in Amman, Doha and Tunis. We\r\nmust emphasize here that the activation of these centres\r\ndoes not at all mean acceptance of the status quo with all\r\nits inherent imbalances, particularly with regard to nuclear\r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The\r\nmain objective that inspired the establishment of those\r\ncentres was to promote confidence-building amongst the\r\nStates of the region and to redress the present imbalances\r\nin order to achieve a more secure and stable Middle East,\r\nas provided for in the Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty.\r\nAt the international level, we hope that the ongoing\r\nnegotiations within the Conference on Disarmament in\r\nGeneva will lead to concluding a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty before the end of next year. We also hope that the\r\nConference on Disarmament will begin negotiations\r\naimed at concluding a treaty on prohibition of the\r\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons, and\r\nanother convention to provide non-nuclear-weapon States\r\nwith security assurances.\r\nAs for the situation in the Gulf, Jordan reaffirms its\r\ninterest in the security of that vital region and its earnest\r\ndesire to establish strong relations of cooperation based\r\non mutual respect and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of any State. In this regard, Jordan firmly supports\r\nand upholds the right of the United Arab Emirates to\r\nsovereignty over the three islands occupied by Iran.\r\nJordan also supports all efforts aiming at bringing about\r\nan end to the Iranian occupation so that good neighbourly\r\nrelations among the States of the region may be\r\nestablished and consolidated.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nWhile we appreciate the positive step taken by Iraq in\r\nrecognizing the sovereignty of Kuwait and its international\r\nboundaries, we emphasize the need to work for lifting the\r\nsanctions imposed on the brotherly people of Iraq, with a\r\nview to putting an end to their suffering, preserving the\r\nunity and the integrity of the people and the territory of\r\nIraq and preventing its fragmentation which would endanger\r\nthe security and safety of the region. Jordan also stresses\r\nthe need to resolve the issue of the missing and detained\r\nKuwaitis. We consider this a matter of utmost importance\r\nbecause of its legal and humanitarian dimensions. We call\r\nfor Iraq’s full compliance with all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions in order to discharge the commitment to\r\nproperly implement Council resolutions in accordance with\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nHaving said this, Jordan affirms its solidarity with and\r\nsympathy for the Iraqi people in their plight and\r\nunderscores the need to respect their legitimate rights and\r\naspirations to freedom and democracy and to safeguard\r\ntheir unity. Jordan states this with a clear conscience, in\r\nconsonance with the Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nJordan has consistently made clear its stand on the\r\ntragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIt supports the sovereignty and independence of this young\r\nrepublic and affirms the need to put an end to the Serbian\r\naggression against it. Jordan also supported the position of\r\nthe Contact Group established by the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, which called for the lifting of the arms\r\nembargo imposed on Bosnia, in conformity with its inherent\r\nright to self-defence. Now, following the latest positive\r\ndevelopments, represented by the Declaration of Principles\r\nagreed upon by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the\r\nStates parties to the conflict under the auspices of the\r\nWestern Contact Group and following the cease-fire\r\ndecision, Jordan supports the position of the Government of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and commends its flexibility in\r\ntrying to reach agreement. We attach great importance to\r\nthe continuation of diplomacy supported by force, which\r\nhas led to the withdrawal by the Serbs of their heavy\r\nweapons from the areas surrounding the capital city of\r\nSarajevo, with all that that entailed in terms of putting an\r\nend to the shelling of civilians, and of leading to the\r\naforementioned Declaration of Principles.\r\nWhile we are to work in earnest for the establishment\r\nof a safer and more secure world order that would be\r\nfounded on the values of freedom, tolerance and equality,\r\nwe must recall the early calls made by Jordan during the\r\n1980s, when His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hassan\r\ncalled for the establishment of a new humanitarian world\r\norder. Those calls were echoed in the proceedings of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly and translated into\r\nresolutions which called for and encouraged the\r\nestablishment and consolidation of such a world order.\r\nPerhaps this new humanitarian world order, because of its\r\naims which would make the human being the main focus\r\nof international action in such areas as the eradication of\r\npoverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap\r\nbetween the rich and the poor, on both the individual and\r\nsocietal levels, may well furnish the solid foundation upon\r\nwhich we can build the desired new world order whose\r\nparameters have not crystallized as yet.\r\nIn the same context, we should encourage interfaith\r\ndialogue. Such a dialogue would bridge the gaps between\r\nthe beliefs and concepts of millions of human beings and,\r\nalso, would make great strides towards advancing human\r\ndevelopment. If achieved, this would limit religious,\r\nsectoral and ethnic conflicts, both internally and amongst\r\nvarious communities at the international level. Perhaps\r\nthere is a window of opportunity now afforded by the end\r\nof the cold war and of ideological and political conflicts.\r\nThis could be a rare and historic opportunity to activate\r\nan interfaith dialogue, thus adding a new and valuable\r\nforum to the existing forums of dialogue.\r\nWe in Jordan have always advocated interfaith\r\ndialogue as a safe way to combat blind bigotry and\r\nstereotyping. In order to achieve this, and in the midst of\r\nthe painful labour that the process of establishing the new\r\nworld order is undergoing, we must not marginalize one\r\nbillion Muslims, exclude them or eventually drive them\r\nto radicalism. Muslims must be partners in the building of\r\nthis new world order and must be actively involved in its\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIslam’s bright image is being distorted, which is a\r\nmatter of grave concern for us. The pervasive anti-Islamic\r\nphenomenon, based on unjustified generalizations, aims at\r\ntarnishing the good name of Muslims and stigmatizing\r\nthem as terrorists and blind extremists, with a view to\r\ntotally distorting Islam’s image. This matter must receive\r\ngreater attention from this international Organization. One\r\nshould not ignore the fact that Islam is an adaptable\r\ncivilization, comprising all shades of political opinion and\r\nall kinds of different religious thought, in addition to a\r\nvast, multifaceted human experience. Jordan urges the\r\nMember States of this international Organization to try to\r\nreach a better understanding of Islam as a religion, as a\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nculture and as a civilization, and to reject the phenomenon\r\nof antagonism to Islam in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nIn conclusion, the road to a world of peace, security\r\nand stability inhabited by democratic societies, a world\r\nwhose main goal is to attain the highest level of economic\r\nand social development, is a long and arduous road indeed.\r\nBut the achievement of these lofty and noble aims of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations is worthy of our sacrifices,\r\nand requires more serious and sincere action at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nThe Acting President (Interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ghana,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Obed Asamoah.\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nMr. Asamoah (Ghana): We are very pleased that Mr.\r\nFreitas do Amaral is presiding over this important occasion,\r\nnot only because of our confidence in his sterling qualities\r\nand acknowledged capabilities, but also because of the long\r\nhistoric links between Portugal and Ghana — links going\r\nback 500 years. We wish him every success in conducting\r\nthe affairs of this fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nTo his predecessor, my brother and colleague from\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, we say “thank you” for a job well done. He\r\nled us through very complicated and difficult issues, such\r\nas the restructuring and reform of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the enlargement of the Security Council. The\r\npatience, equanimity and skill which he displayed\r\nthroughout his presidency won the admiration of us all.\r\nTo Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, we say a special word\r\nof thanks and appreciation for his indefatigable energy, his\r\nremarkable commitment to the independence of the United\r\nNations and his steadfast resolve to help carry the\r\nOrganization forward on a sounder footing.\r\nFifty years of life, be it of a person or an institution,\r\nis an appropriate occasion for celebration and we are all\r\nlooking forward to the festivities planned for the latter part\r\nof this month in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. It must also, however, be an\r\noccasion for a sober assessment of success and progress\r\nattained, as well as an in-depth analysis of the shortcomings\r\nexperienced and how best to overcome them.\r\nIn 1945, 51 States, by signing the United Nations\r\nCharter and setting up the Organization, ushered in a new\r\nera in international affairs. I recall that only four African\r\ncountries were Members of the United Nations at its\r\ninception. Today, the United Nations comprises 185\r\nMember States, of which, perhaps, Africa is the continent\r\nwith the largest representation.\r\nThe very fact that the United Nations has grown in\r\nthe past 50 years to encompass in its membership almost\r\nall sovereign States of the international community\r\nindicates a positive development. This is important\r\nbecause of the growing interdependence of States and the\r\ncommon interest of the international community in the\r\nsolution of the complex and myriad issues of\r\ncontemporary life.\r\nTo those who criticize the United Nations and the\r\nGeneral Assembly in particular as a mere talking shop, I\r\nwould say that the tradition of discussion and debate, of\r\nlistening to and appreciating the views of others is of\r\ngreat value. This is precisely the rationale for setting up\r\nthis forum. It is only through such a process that diverse\r\nviews can be harmonized and compromises struck. But\r\neven the sceptic will admit that the United Nations has an\r\nappreciable record of humanitarian and social\r\nimprovement throughout the globe, in decolonization and\r\nin the settlement of disputes and conflicts.\r\nOur hope that the end of the cold war would bring\r\nin its train a new era of enduring peace and international\r\nharmony has been rudely dispelled. Much has indeed\r\nchanged but much remains the same. The perennial\r\nconflicts of the past are taking new and troubling\r\ndimensions with “ethnic cleansing”, genocide and strident\r\nforms of nationalism threatening international tranquillity.\r\nThis fiftieth anniversary is the appropriate occasion for all\r\nStates to ponder carefully how these problems can be\r\neffectively contained. We are encouraged by recent events\r\nto hope that the ugly conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\ncan and will be solved, and we must pay tribute to the\r\nUnited States for this development.\r\nWe also note with appreciation the recent Israeli-\r\nPalestinian accords signed in Washington as another\r\nmilestone in the progress towards genuine peace in the\r\nMiddle East. We would, however, urge all parties to show\r\nmore flexibility and understanding in ensuring a\r\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East problem,\r\nwhich, inter alia, would include full self-determination for\r\nthe Palestinian people and the restoration of occupied\r\nArab lands.\r\nNo conflict can be resolved without the willingness\r\nof the parties to be reasonable and ready for compromise.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nThe Afghans, the Somalis and others stand in danger of\r\nneglect and they must wake up to this reality. The leaders\r\nof the warring parties in these countries must appreciate the\r\nenormous responsibility on their shoulders not to condemn\r\ntheir compatriots to senseless slaughter in perpetuity.\r\nThe developing countries generally find themselves in\r\ndifficult economic circumstances as a result of an\r\nunfavourable international economic climate. The need for\r\nconcerted international action to restructure the international\r\neconomy in order to meet the challenges of absolute\r\npoverty, malnutrition, disease and illiteracy, among others,\r\nin the developing countries cannot be overemphasized. In\r\nthis context, we appreciate the limited success of the\r\nimportant global conferences of the past year, especially\r\nthat on population and development in Cairo, the World\r\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen and, last\r\nbut not least, the Fourth World Conference on Women in\r\nBeijing. The very fact that the international community has\r\nbeen able to improve and agree on a set of guidelines for\r\nfuture action in each of these vitally important social areas\r\nis in itself a remarkable achievement. We trust that the\r\nnecessary political will to implement what has been agreed\r\nupon will be exercised by all.\r\nAllow me to say a few words about last April’s\r\nreview and extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We note with regret that, so\r\nsoon after the indefinite extension of the NPT, the very\r\nfears which made some of us question the wisdom of an\r\nindefinite extension have been fulfilled by the resumption\r\nof nuclear testing in the Pacific. We had argued that an\r\nindefinite extension would leave the nuclear Powers with no\r\nreal incentive to make further progress on the arms control\r\nagenda. We must condemn in no uncertain terms the breach\r\nof the underlying implications of the consensus reached on\r\nthe indefinite extension of the NPT. Let us hope that\r\nlessons will be learned from the almost universal\r\ncondemnation of the French tests and that there will be\r\nmovement towards a rapid conclusion of a comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty and action on the other major issues in the\r\narea of disarmament.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping continues to assume\r\ngreat prominence in the range of United Nations activities.\r\nThis has been in clear response to urgent needs in various\r\nparts of the world, and we in Ghana continue to try to\r\nmake a modest contribution through participation in such\r\nmissions as that in Rwanda. We are pleased to note that a\r\nlot of thinking is going on about how to improve and\r\nstrengthen the United Nations peace-keeping role. We will\r\ncontinue to take an active part in these discussions and we\r\nhope it will be possible to agree on new arrangements\r\nthat will be to the benefit of us all.\r\nAllow me, on this issue, to express my delegation’s\r\nprofound regret at the delay of the United Nations in\r\nreimbursing troop- contributing countries, such as mine,\r\nfor expenditures incurred in United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. We urge that every effort be made to resolve\r\nthis matter as speedily as possible. Of course, it will help\r\ngreatly if Member States in arrears in their contributions\r\nhonour their obligations and pay up. We urge them to do\r\nso without further delay.\r\nWhile on the subject of peace-keeping, may I say a\r\nfew words about what we in West Africa have tried to do\r\nin Liberia. In the spirit of the relevant provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the Treaty setting up the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), ECOWAS countries took the initiative to set\r\nup the cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to stop\r\nthe bloodshed in Liberia. Today we are pleased to see\r\nthat the Abuja and earlier agreements have made possible\r\nthe restoration of relative peace in that country. The\r\nchallenge now is to see through the implementation\r\nprocess. That will require a considerable increase in troop\r\nstrength, logistics for ECOMOG and for the encampment,\r\ndisarmament and resettlement of rival forces engaged in\r\nthe civil war. International assistance is greatly needed to\r\nmeet these objectives. It is hoped that a ready response\r\nwill be forthcoming at the pledging conference envisaged\r\nfor later this month.\r\nWhat ECOMOG has done in Liberia is a good\r\nexample of how subregional and regional organizations\r\nshould support the United Nations in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. But the United Nations\r\nwill need to overcome doctrinal obstacles and to develop\r\nprinciples that will facilitate hybrid operations involving\r\nsubregional initiatives and United Nations financing in\r\nwhole or in part.\r\nOn Rwanda, Ghana has again demonstrated the\r\ndepth of its commitment to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security by sending troops to the\r\nfront line. Our actions speak louder than words. Liberia\r\nand Rwanda are the latest in a long history of Ghanaian\r\nparticipation in peace-keeping operations. We will\r\ncontinue to make a contribution whenever and wherever\r\nwe are called upon to assist. That is why Ghana\r\nsponsored the preparation of the Anglo-French glossary of\r\npeace-keeping terms, which provides precise terminology\r\nfor vital words regularly used in the actual theatre of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\noperations. Our gratitude goes to the British, French and\r\nSenegalese Governments, who all helped make the exercise\r\na success.\r\nAfrica’s economic problems are too well known for\r\nme to recount. Allow me to state that some of us are\r\nbeginning to wonder about the seriousness of the\r\ninternational community in helping Africa help itself.\r\nConference after conference and seminar after seminar have\r\nbeen held in the past few years on this issue. Study after\r\nstudy by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World\r\nBank and numerous other institutions and distinguished\r\npersonalities have been published, dissecting every\r\ndimension of the continent’s problems.\r\nAfrican countries have committed themselves\r\nrepeatedly to carry out far-reaching economic and\r\ninstitutional reforms, on the express understanding that their\r\nefforts would be fully complemented by the requisite\r\nmaterial support of the international community, particularly\r\nthe advanced countries.\r\nWhile not down-playing the assistance Africa has\r\nreceived in the past few years, I must register the profound\r\ndisappointment of many of us on the continent that the\r\nexpected volume of assistance has never been forthcoming.\r\nMoreover, the requisite action on the debt and aid fronts,\r\nwhich would have completed the picture, has also not been\r\nadequate.\r\nThis is all the more regrettable because of the\r\nprofound political risks that many Governments in Africa\r\nhave run by faithfully implementing painful structural\r\nadjustment programmes that have had a severe impact on\r\ntheir peoples. It is also unfortunate because Africa has seen\r\na tremendous upsurge of popular empowerment which has\r\nfound expression in the establishment of constitutional rule\r\nin country after country. Let it not appear that the\r\ninternational community deliberately wishes to marginalize\r\nthe African continent. The problem of poverty of the\r\nAfrican continent, if not tackled seriously, could pose grave\r\ndangers to international peace and security. Many conflicts\r\nin Africa are occasioned by the strains of development and\r\nthey could easily take on international dimensions.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, let us seek to fight against the arrogance of power\r\nand the return to the habits of colonialism as exhibited in\r\nthe unjustified economic blockade against Cuba and the\r\nsanctions imposed on Libya. Such actions, particularly\r\nwhen sponsored by the United Nations, will serve to\r\nundermine the integrity of this Organization. The collapse\r\nof the cold war must make us more vigilant against any\r\nattempt to turn the United Nations into an instrument of\r\nthe foreign policy of any one country or group of\r\ncountries. When that happens, regional and subregional\r\norganizations will be tempted to question and/or disobey\r\nthe decisions of the United Nations. This will be a tragic\r\ndevelopment that must be avoided at all costs. That is\r\nwhy Ghana, like other members of the OAU, calls upon\r\nthe Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed\r\nunjustifiably on Libya and seek a peaceful solution to the\r\nLockerbie affair and other related matters. We must of\r\ncourse forever maintain an uncompromising resolve to\r\nfight mindless terrorism.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming Ghana’s\r\ncommitment to the United Nations as the best hope for\r\npeace and international cooperation. Long live the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMongolia, His Excellency Mr. Tserenpiliin Gombosuren.\r\nMr. Gombosuren (Mongolia): May I be permitted\r\nto offer to His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral my\r\nsincere congratulations on his election to the high post of\r\nPresident of the golden fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I am confident that, under his able\r\nstewardship, the Assembly will succeed in advancing the\r\nnoble aims and objectives of our Charter. I wish also to\r\nrecord my delegation’s profound appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nwho presided most ably over the various activities of our\r\nAssembly during the forty-ninth session.\r\nThe year 1995 is to be singled out for its landmark\r\nanniversaries. The fiftieth anniversary of the end of the\r\nSecond World War is being observed worldwide with a\r\nrenewed sense of comprehension of its painful lessons.\r\nThis coincides with the golden jubilee of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations, which embodies in its\r\nCharter the aspirations of our forefathers who, having\r\nstood actual witnesses to the horrors of a most devastating\r\nwar, pledged to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war and settle international disputes by\r\npeaceful means.\r\nAt the time of this historic celebration it is only\r\nfitting to pay tribute to the architects of the Charter,\r\nwhose vision inspired it with continued viability and\r\nvalidity.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nThe family of the United Nations has come to\r\nembrace 185 sovereign States, a fact that unequivocally\r\nattests to the genuine universality and validity of its\r\nunderlying purposes and principles. The world Organization\r\nhas throughout served as a powerful engine for bringing\r\nabout dramatic changes both in the domain of international\r\nrelations and in the development process of nations.\r\nThe United Nations is to be credited with impressive\r\naccomplishments in strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity, marshalling the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to put an end to colonialism and apartheid,\r\nensuring the independence and sovereignty of developing\r\ncountries and supporting their socio-economic development,\r\nadvocating human rights and fundamental freedoms and\r\nprotecting and preserving the environment, as well as in\r\npromoting education, culture, science and health.\r\nIt can be said that at the heart of these\r\naccomplishments lies the international community’s\r\ngrowing realization of the prevalence of global priorities\r\nand the objective trends in historical developments, along\r\nwith the wisdom of mastering the philosophy of fine-tuning\r\nthe differing interests of States.\r\nHowever, the book of the Organization’s half-century\r\nhistory does not consist exclusively of success stories.\r\nThere are chapters portraying the set-backs and failures of\r\nthe United Nations when it was effectively handicapped by\r\nthe then prevalent ideological antagonisms and military-bloc\r\nconfrontation. There were times when sovereign States\r\ncould not exercise their right to become Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. Mongolia, for one, which steadfastly sided\r\nwith the Allied forces and other peace-loving nations during\r\nthe Second World War, and made its humble contribution\r\nto the great victory, was until 1961 prevented from\r\nexercising its legitimate right to join the world\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe upcoming solemn celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations by the largest ever\r\ngathering of world leaders demonstrates that the\r\ninternational community, by associating its present and its\r\nfuture with the United Nations, is placing its hopes and\r\naspirations in the Organization. We hope that the special\r\ncommemorative meeting will be crowned with the adoption\r\nof the visionary document reaffirming the underlying\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and outlining\r\nforward-looking strategies commensurate with the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium. In this regard, the\r\nSecretary-General’s stimulating reports “An Agenda for\r\nPeace” and “An Agenda for Development” and their\r\nsubsequent supplements help greatly in revamping our\r\nconcepts of peace, security and development, as well as\r\nin our collective reflection on our future.\r\nThe United Nations has served as a catalyst for\r\nconvening a series of global conferences — conferences\r\non the protection of children, on the environment, on\r\nhuman rights, on population and social development and\r\non the advancement of women — resulting in the\r\nformulation of common strategies and specific platforms\r\nfor action, now and into the twenty-first century. In order\r\nto ensure the full implementation of this comprehensive\r\nstrategy of sustainable human development it is\r\nimperative to streamline the existing machinery for\r\nmultilateral cooperation. Here, I wish to emphasize the\r\nurgent need for reform to take in the entire system of the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nby, inter alia, increasing the effectiveness of organizations\r\nin the economic and social fields, as well as improving\r\ntheir coordination.\r\nMomentous post-cold-war change has, in fact, failed\r\nto embrace international economic relations — an area of\r\nmajor concern to the United Nations. The persisting\r\ninequities and imbalances, as well as protectionist\r\ntendencies, the growing external-debt burden, the inability\r\nto participate equally in international decision-making and\r\ndeclining official development assistance flows, weigh\r\nheavily on the efforts of the developing countries\r\neffectively to address the pressing socio-economic\r\nproblems that they face.\r\nMongolia fully supports the efforts of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement and the Group of 77 to call the\r\nattention of the international community, and of the\r\nGroup of Seven in particular, to the question of\r\naddressing these acute problems. It goes without saying\r\nthat this common objective can be attained only through\r\njoint North-South action.\r\nThe persistence and proliferation of wars and crisis\r\nsituations testify to the fact that conventional attitudes\r\ntowards the use of force as a standard means of settling\r\ndisputes have not been done away with and that the worth\r\nof the human person and his or her right to life continue\r\nto be denied.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the United Nations has seen\r\nover the last few years a marked expansion in its\r\nactivities in the area of peace-keeping, peacemaking and\r\npreventive diplomacy. Despite the difficulties encountered\r\nand the growing complexity of their missions, the peace-\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nkeeping operations have largely succeeded in places where\r\nthey have intervened for the purposes of restoring peace\r\nand normality. The failures suffered by the United Nations\r\nshould not, however, frustrate its efforts in the future.\r\nLessons drawn from these failures should help the\r\nOrganization to weigh its potentials and limitations\r\nrealistically and to act within mandates that are clear and\r\nattainable.\r\nIf the Security Council is to reflect today’s realities\r\nand to live up to the challenges ahead, the reform\r\nprocess — democratization of its working methods and the\r\nintroduction of greater transparency into its activities —\r\nshould be further intensified. It is Mongolia’s considered\r\nview that expansion of the Security Council should be\r\nbased on the principles of fairness and equitable\r\nrepresentation. This should be ensured by, inter alia, the\r\nadmission of countries with a global reach, like Japan and\r\nGermany, as well as representatives of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nIt is important to take specific steps to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of the resolution on the protection and\r\nsecurity of small States adopted at the last session.\r\nMongolia welcomes the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nspecific development needs of small Member States, and\r\nexpects that the ideas and recommendations that it contains\r\nwill be duly reflected in the activities of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMongolia highly appreciates the international\r\ncommunity’s understanding of the problems and hardships\r\nfaced by countries in transition and the support for their\r\nefforts to integrate into the world economy. We deem it\r\nimportant that the General Assembly has decided to\r\nconsider this issue at its fifty-first session. My delegation\r\nhopes that the report on this subject to be prepared by the\r\nSecretary-General will take due account of the\r\ncharacteristics of all countries — in particular, geographic\r\nlocation, climatic conditions and infrastructure development,\r\namong others.\r\nWe applaud the entry into force of the Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, which is widely acclaimed as one of\r\nthe historic achievements of United Nations cooperative\r\nefforts. There is no need to emphasize the importance of\r\nthat Convention to countries like Mongolia, which is a\r\ngeographically disadvantaged, land-locked developing\r\ncountry with an unfavourable road and transportation\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe Mongolian delegation expresses its hope that the\r\nGeneral Assembly will at its present session endorse the\r\nrecommendations adopted last June by the Second\r\nMeeting of Governmental Experts from Land-locked and\r\nTransit Developing Countries and Representatives of\r\nDonor Countries and Financial and Development\r\nInstitutions.\r\nWe believe that the World Trade Organization will\r\nfacilitate the integration of developing countries into the\r\ninternational trading system and ensure the protection of\r\ntheir interests through benefits derived from the trade-\r\ndiscipline mechanism.\r\nThe disarmament agenda was highlighted this year\r\nby the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT), which considered the operation of the Treaty and\r\ndecided on its indefinite extension.\r\nAmong the important objectives and principles\r\naimed at strengthening the nuclear disarmament process\r\nwith practical measures, special mention should be made\r\nof those related to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-\r\nban treaty. It is, however, deplorable that two nuclear-\r\nweapon States Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty,\r\ncontrary to the commitments undertaken, are conducting\r\nnuclear tests and have announced their intention to\r\ncontinue them. A zero-yield comprehensive test-ban\r\nrecently announced by the United States Administration\r\nwill, in our view, speed up the negotiations on the treaty\r\nso that it may be concluded next year.\r\nWe wish to express our concern over the slow pace\r\nof ratification of the chemical weapons Convention, which\r\nis unnecessarily delaying its entry into force. We call\r\nupon those countries that have not yet done so to ratify\r\nthe Convention as soon as possible.\r\nMongolia welcomes the interim agreement on the\r\nsecond stage of autonomy reached by the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel within the\r\nframework of achieving the full realization of the\r\nPalestinian people’s right to self-determination. That\r\nagreement represents a major step towards consolidating\r\nthe peace process in the Middle East.\r\nMy delegation also expresses its satisfaction at the\r\nrecent agreements regarding the former Yugoslavia, which\r\ngive us hope for the eventual solution of the protracted\r\ncrisis there.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nWe believe that the Eleventh Conference of Heads of\r\nState or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which will\r\ntake place in Colombia shortly, will outline the tasks of the\r\nMovement in the years to come and will make its\r\ncontribution to the efforts of the world community aimed at\r\nsolving a host of interrelated problems of strengthening\r\ninternational peace and security and promoting development\r\nand progress.\r\nIt is of great importance that with the strengthening of\r\npeace, stability and economic growth in the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion, the contours of regional and subregional cooperation\r\nare becoming more pronounced. The progress achieved in\r\nresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has had\r\na positive bearing on the prospects of overall settlement in\r\nthat part of our region.\r\nMongolia, in line with its foreign-policy priorities, is\r\nendeavouring to participate more actively in the process of\r\nregional integration. We trust that this stance will enjoy\r\ngreater support from other Governments.\r\nMore than five years have elapsed since Mongolia\r\nembarked upon the road of democracy and economic\r\nliberalization. A solid foundation for a new political fabric\r\nand its legal guarantees has been laid down. The economic\r\ndecline has been checked, and signs of recovery are being\r\ndiscerned. We are gratified by the support and assistance of\r\nthe world community, donor countries and international\r\norganizations, which continue to play an important role in\r\nconsolidating these positive beginnings.\r\nHowever, the hardships of transition are still being\r\nacutely felt as, inter alia, our gross national product is quite\r\nfar from its pre-crisis level, living standards are in decline\r\nand poverty is on the rise. Under these circumstances, my\r\nGovernment, in addition to mobilizing its own resources to\r\nthe utmost, is compelled to seek further assistance from\r\noutside. In this regard, we look forward to the fifth donor\r\nmeeting, to be held in Tokyo early next year.\r\nIn conclusion, may I express my confidence that at\r\nthis commemorative session the General Assembly will\r\nconsider the items on its agenda in a constructive manner\r\nand will adopt decisions responding to the challenges\r\nahead.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tourism and\r\nCivil Aviation of Fiji, His Excellency Senator Filipe Nagera\r\nBole.\r\nMr. Bole (Fiji): Allow me first of all to express\r\nvery warm greetings and congratulations to the President\r\nfrom the Government and people of Fiji on his election to\r\npreside over the General Assembly at this historic fiftieth\r\nsession. We are confident that with his vast experience\r\nand demonstrated leadership, the General Assembly will\r\ncomplete its deliberations at this important session\r\nfruitfully. I would also like to express the compliments of\r\nmy delegation to His Excellency Foreign Minister Amara\r\nEssy, whose presidency during the forty-ninth session\r\nbrought the work of the General Assembly to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI wish to join other speakers in warmly welcoming\r\nthe Republic of Palau as the one hundred and eighty-fifth\r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nOn 13 October 1970, a quarter of a century ago, Fiji,\r\na newly independent State only three days old, was\r\nadmitted as this body’s one hundred twenty-sixth\r\nmember. Standing at this very rostrum, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative Designate of Fiji to the United Nations,\r\nAmbassador Semesa Sikivou, said,\r\n“Although I represent a small country far away\r\nin the Pacific, my Government and people warmly\r\ncherish the principles and ideals which led to the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations and which have\r\nmade this great Assembly, in its 25 years of\r\nexistence, one of the main hopes for the future of\r\nmankind. And we are fully resolved to play our part,\r\nhowever humble, in helping to maintain and foster\r\nthe high purpose for which this Assembly was\r\nestablished — the brotherhood of mankind.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-\r\nfifth Session, Plenary Meetings, 1863rd meeting,\r\npara. 111)\r\nToday I wish to confirm that since that memorable\r\noccasion, nothing has changed to diminish that resolve in\r\nany way. It has never been shaken. The intervening years\r\nhave demonstrated that the high purpose to which\r\nAmbassador Sikivou referred constitutes the very cement\r\nthat binds us together in the pursuit of a common global\r\ndestiny. The principles and ideals which inspired the\r\narchitects of the United Nations still endure as noble\r\ngoals that challenge us.\r\nToday is a special day for Fiji because it marks the\r\ntwenty-fifth year of our nationhood. While anniversaries\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nare appropriate moments for celebration, they are also a\r\nfitting time for reflection, stocktaking and giving thanks. In\r\nour particular case, Fiji owes a debt of gratitude to its\r\nfriends in the international community who reached out to\r\nassist us over these years. Since that moment, over two\r\ndecades ago, when our frail canoe embarked on its long\r\nvoyage, with all its reefs and shoals, it has been comforting\r\nto have so many friends ready to show us the beacons and\r\nlighthouses, enabling us to choose a course that would\r\nmake our independence meaningful for ourselves. On behalf\r\nof the Government and the people of Fiji, it is my solemn\r\nduty today to say thank you to our friends. As the canoe\r\ncontinues its journey, we are confident that we will be able\r\nto continue counting on the guidance and help of our\r\nfriends. And this includes the United Nations — we highly\r\nvalue our association with it and the assistance it provides.\r\nHalf a century ago, the United Nations was established\r\nto end the scourge of war and build a better world for\r\nsucceeding generations. The cold war and its attendant\r\nsuper-Power rivalry have ended. However, despite\r\ndecreases in inter-State conflicts, recent history indicates\r\nthat the much-promised peace dividend from the end of the\r\nsterile confrontations that characterized much of the life of\r\nthe United Nations has not materialized. Conflicts within\r\nStates continue to tear at the fabric of established societies.\r\nCan we truly say, looking around our world, that it is better\r\ntoday than it was 50 years ago?\r\nDuring the last year, in particular, there has been\r\nmuch soul-searching about the role of the United Nations.\r\nThis has stemmed in part from a growing perception that in\r\nthe face of civil strife, the Blue Helmets have been\r\npowerless to save lives and prevent conflict. I believe that\r\nthe seeming hesitancy of United Nations peace-keepers\r\nreflects our inability as Member States of the Organization\r\nto develop a clear and confident sense of the new role of\r\nthe United Nations in today’s changed global environment.\r\nWe all have a collective responsibility to ensure that\r\na more precise vision of the role of the modern United\r\nNations is created. With political will, we can do it. In this\r\nprocess, I suggest that the moment is right for us to\r\nrededicate ourselves to the Charter, for it is the principles\r\nenshrined in it that represent our best opportunity for\r\nfinding a clear direction ahead as we approach the new\r\nmillennium. No less important is that we, as Member\r\nStates, should equip our Organization with the resources to\r\ncarry out its reinvigorated mandate.\r\nThe United Nations must further enlarge its\r\ninstruments of preventive diplomacy. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Agenda for Peace has clearly made an\r\noutstanding contribution to discussions in this area. Fiji\r\nurges the Assembly to give earnest consideration to\r\nimplementing his recommendations on this issue. Fiji\r\nconsiders that there is much merit to proposals that a\r\nspecial department or unit be set up to deal with conflict\r\nprevention and resolution. This unit could coordinate the\r\nactions of a rapid-deployment force to be dispatched to\r\ntrouble spots when conflicts erupt. More importantly, it\r\nwould collate, analyse and interpret information and\r\nintelligence and develop early detection capacities on\r\npotential conflict situations. It would also work with\r\nStates in developing confidence-building measures\r\ndesigned to minimize both intra- and inter-State conflicts.\r\nThe financial position of the United Nations\r\ncontinues to be a matter of concern to Fiji. In this we are\r\nnot alone, I am sure. The sudden and huge increase in\r\nexpenditures for peace-keeping operations to a level more\r\nthan three times as high as that of expenditures for\r\ndevelopment is becoming difficult to sustain and justify.\r\nIt has been our view for some time that the apparent\r\nimbalance between resources committed to security issues\r\nand those committed to development is not justified.\r\nAs regards peace-keeping, we all know that there are\r\nlarge-scale arrears in contributions. We do not object to\r\npeace-keeping operations. On the contrary, despite our\r\nsmallness and our relative lack of resources, we have\r\nbeen a consistent and active contributor of troops to\r\nvarious peace-keeping missions. Fiji has paid a heavy\r\nhuman and financial price for contributing troops, but it\r\nhas done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do\r\nso. Clearly, though, the United Nations has to rationalize\r\nits peace-keeping expenditures and at the same time\r\nreimburse fully and in timely fashion monies that it owes\r\nto troop-contributing countries.\r\nIt is now becoming clear that a large number of\r\nMember States, if not the majority, wish the United\r\nNations to devote more attention and resources to human\r\nand social development. Ultimately, there can be no\r\nsustainable peace without development. Enduring\r\nsolutions to social and economic problems represent the\r\nbasic infrastructure for long-term peace. The United\r\nNations cannot — indeed, must not — shrink from this\r\naspect of its mission.\r\nA greater rationalization of agencies and\r\nprogrammes within the United Nations and its agencies\r\nmust be tackled with urgency and vigour. Fiji supports\r\nefforts to establish a high-level working group on United\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nNations reform, and we look forward to contributing to\r\nefforts within the Organization aimed at revitalizing and\r\nstrengthening the United Nations system. Of critical\r\nimportance to this review process is the need for the United\r\nNations to redirect its focus away from activities of limited\r\nvalue and relevance and to strengthen those which the\r\nMember States identify as meaningful. This will require the\r\ntaking of some hard decisions which can no longer be\r\npostponed.\r\nThe end of bipolarism and the increased membership\r\nof the United Nations have created new challenges for the\r\nOrganization. One of these is the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Fiji has followed with keen interest the\r\ndeliberations of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council. We believe that the\r\nstructures of the United Nations should reflect changes in\r\nthe global political landscape. They should reflect the\r\nprinciples of geographical representation and equity\r\nconsistent with today’s global political and economic\r\nrealities. The arguments for an enlarged Security Council\r\nreflecting these principles are compelling. Fiji also believes\r\nthat while questions as to the form of the Council are\r\nimportant, equal attention to the substance of the Security\r\nCouncil is crucial. In particular, we would urge that closer\r\nattention be paid to the “veto” power in the light of the new\r\nglobal realities to which I have referred.\r\nFiji would like to register its strong view that the\r\nquestion of the protection and security of small States\r\nremains a central concern of the United Nations. Last year,\r\nwe joined in sponsoring a resolution on this issue in the\r\nFourth Committee, for as long as drug traffickers,\r\ninternational arms dealers, money launderers and\r\ninternational white-collar criminals continue to ply their\r\ntrade, and as long as mercenaries and terrorists and other\r\nadventurers exist, the protection and security of small States\r\nwill remain vulnerable to acts of aggression from without\r\nas well as from within. Small States especially look to the\r\nprovisions of the Charter as regards respect for their\r\nsovereignty and its preservation.\r\nEarlier this year, Fiji joined other States Members of\r\nthe United Nations in agreeing to an unconditional and\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The Review and Extension\r\nConference was difficult and involved a willingness to\r\ncompromise on the part of many parties. During the\r\nConference, Fiji stated that the future viability of the NPT\r\nwould depend on the conduct of States in relation to their\r\nrights and obligations. Fiji went along with the decision to\r\nextend the Treaty despite its imperfections because we\r\nbelieved that it made an important contribution to global\r\npeace and security.\r\nWe were therefore bitterly disappointed when France\r\nannounced its decision in June this year to resume nuclear\r\ntesting in the South Pacific. Coming in the wake of the\r\nNPT Conference, the French decision displayed great\r\ninsensitivity. Fiji has long been a consistent opponent of\r\nnuclear testing in all forms and in all environments. If\r\nanything, we believe that rather than contribute to, they\r\ndetract from, national and indeed global security. As an\r\noceanic State heavily dependent on the sea for food and\r\nsurvival, we maintain that nuclear testing in our region\r\nhas a more immediate impact. It threatens one of our\r\nmain sources of livelihood and our health, not only at the\r\npresent time, but for generations to come. The French\r\ndecision to resume nuclear testing at Mururoa has, as is\r\nwell known, met with worldwide condemnation. South\r\nPacific countries, as those most immediately affected,\r\nhave added their strong individual and collective voices\r\nto the protests. In the light of the cessation of the cold\r\nwar, one might ask, What is the need for further testing\r\nof nuclear weapons?\r\nFiji therefore urges France, even at this stage, after\r\nit has already detonated two of its planned eight nuclear\r\ndevices, to reconsider its decision. It is not too late to turn\r\nthe clock back. In recent years, thanks to the moratorium\r\non testing put in place by President Mitterrand, France\r\nhas enjoyed cordial relations in the Pacific region, but all\r\nthat good will and the warmth of those relationships are\r\nnow being rapidly compromised by their recent decision.\r\nAt their meeting in Madang last month the leaders of the\r\nPacific Forum expressed their extreme outrage at the\r\nresumption by the French of their nuclear testing in the\r\nPacific. They decided that, should France continue its\r\ntesting in the Pacific, the Forum would review the status\r\nof France as a Forum dialogue partner. It is therefore\r\nsingularly disappointing that despite all these objections,\r\nFrance went ahead and detonated a second nuclear device\r\nat Fagataufa, on 2 October 1995. We regard this as a slap\r\nin the face of the leaders of the Forum and a violent\r\ncrime against the people of the South Pacific.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the Forum has now duly\r\nsuspended France as a post-Forum dialogue partner. This\r\nwill remain so until France changes its decision on\r\nnuclear testing in the Pacific. Fiji fully associates itself\r\nwith the Forum decision.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nFiji would also like to express its deep regret at the\r\ncontinued nuclear testing by the People’s Republic of\r\nChina. We see no justification for such tests. My\r\nGovernment calls upon all States having similar intentions\r\nto desist from taking any action that would threaten\r\nnegotiations at the current session of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament taking place in Geneva. While present\r\nindications are that negotiations to conclude a universal,\r\nmultilateral and effectively verifiable nuclear-test-ban treaty\r\nare on track, we cannot yet assume that the time for\r\ncongratulations and back-patting has been reached. That\r\nwill only come with the final conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty (CTBT) which takes into\r\naccount the security of all States, including non-nuclear\r\nStates. Fiji continues to place high priority on completion\r\nof the CTBT negotiations in 1996. We welcome President\r\nClinton’s commitment to a zero threshold test-ban treaty.\r\nFiji urges other nuclear-weapon States that have not yet\r\ndone so to give similar assurances. These States have a\r\nspecial responsibility in ensuring that the CTBT\r\nnegotiations remain on track. We believe that a\r\ncomprehensive treaty covering all relevant concerns will\r\nmake a significant contribution to efforts towards nuclear\r\ndisarmament and the prevention of the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons in all its aspects.\r\nWithin our own region, the South Pacific, we have a\r\nnumber of conventions and treaties designed to keep the\r\nregion free from nuclear and other hazardous material.\r\nThese include the Convention for the Protection and\r\nDevelopment of the Natural Resources and Environment of\r\nthe South Pacific Region, of 1989, and its related\r\nProtocols — the Noumea Convention, the Waigani\r\nConvention — which was opened for signature only last\r\nmonth and which aims to ban the importation into Forum\r\nisland countries of hazardous and radioactive wastes and to\r\ncontrol the transboundary movement and management of\r\nhazardous wastes within the South Pacific region — and\r\nthe South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty, the Treaty of\r\nRarotonga, of 1985, and its three Protocols.\r\nWith regard to the latter, we are pleased that two of\r\nthe five nuclear Powers — China and the Russian\r\nFederation — have signed the relevant Protocols. But the\r\nremaining three have not done so as yet. We therefore urge\r\nthe United States of America, France and the United\r\nKingdom to sign the Protocols as soon as possible as a\r\ndemonstration of their commitment to a comprehensive\r\nnuclear test-ban treaty.\r\nFrom a global perspective, it had been predicted that\r\nthe conclusion of the Uruguay Round would link economies\r\nmore strongly through increased flows of trade and\r\nfinance based on trade liberalization and a concomitant\r\nstrengthening of multilateral trading systems. While trade\r\nliberalization caused by the Uruguay Round has had\r\npositive effects on the trade and incomes of some\r\ncountries, the beneficial results of that process have been\r\nfar from uniform. Nor have they been universal. Most, if\r\nnot all, of the Pacific island countries are among those\r\nthat have been adversely affected by the changed global\r\ntrading regime, in part as a result of the removal of\r\ncertain preferential trade arrangements of which they\r\nformed a part. Small island developing economies have\r\nborne the brunt of these changes, which have forced\r\nsometimes painful adjustments.\r\nWe would therefore urge our developed-country\r\npartners to assist efforts we are making at the national\r\nand regional levels to enhance our international economic\r\ncompetitiveness and to expand our trading opportunities.\r\nLast year, Fiji, along with other small island developing\r\ncountries, welcomed General Assembly resolution 49/100,\r\nwhich recalled the special economic vulnerability of the\r\nsmall island developing States. Fiji acknowledges the role\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the Department for Policy\r\nCoordination and Sustainable Development of the\r\nSecretariat in research and policy analysis in the\r\nstrengthening of the capacities of small island developing\r\nStates to capture a larger share of world trade. We\r\nwelcome the recent appointments of senior staff in both\r\nthose entities to provide greater focus on problems related\r\nto small island developing States. However, Fiji believes\r\nthat more tangible and concrete evidence of specific\r\nsupport measures to small island developing States must\r\nbe put in place without further delay. We would urgently\r\ncommend this as a matter to be studied in some detail by\r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development at its high-\r\nlevel segment to be convened next year.\r\nTalk of peace and development enjoins all within\r\nour global village, especially leaders, to recall and to\r\nrededicate themselves to the commitments they agreed to\r\nat the World Summit for Social Development held earlier\r\nthis year in Denmark. If we as leaders in Government\r\ncommit ourselves to creating an economic, political and\r\nsocial environment that will enable people to achieve\r\nsocial development, we will have gone a long way\r\ntowards creating an environment conducive to peace.\r\nFiji would therefore renew its plea to the developed\r\nindustrialized countries to enhance their assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries within the framework of the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nCopenhagen Declaration to bring about improved standards\r\nof living in the third world. In the long term, more stable\r\nand more affluent national societies comprising well-\r\nnourished individuals will be less of a threat to global peace\r\nand stability than States whose citizens languish in abject\r\npoverty and the horrors of sectarian violence. At the same\r\ntime, we also recognize that since resources, particularly\r\ndevelopment assistance, are getting harder to come by, it is\r\nincumbent upon all of us to see that whatever resources are\r\nmade available are put to the best possible use.\r\nIndeed, proper management of resources is\r\nincreasingly becoming one of the major preoccupations of\r\nboth the aid donors and the aid recipients in our region of\r\nthe South Pacific. The South Pacific Forum had “Managing\r\nresources” as its theme in 1994. The Forum’s deliberations\r\nthis year, which took place only last month in Papua New\r\nGuinea, centred on the theme of “Securing development\r\nbeyond 2000”. As in previous years, the Forum island\r\nmembers again had very useful discussions with aid donors\r\nin the region in their post-Forum dialogue. We are deeply\r\nappreciative of the opportunity to sit down together with the\r\ndonors and discuss regional issues of mutual concern. The\r\ndonors included the United States, the United Kingdom,\r\nFrance, Japan, Canada, the European Union, the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea.\r\nWe believe that regional cooperation will play an\r\nincreasingly important role in the development of our\r\nnational economies. We therefore highly value our\r\nincreasing contacts with the countries members of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the\r\neconomies of South-East Asia generally. This includes\r\nTaiwan, with which we enjoy very useful and close trade,\r\neconomic and technical cooperation, just as we do with the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China, with which we have strong and\r\nunequivocally clear official relations. We believe that\r\nTaiwan, like the People’s Republic of China, has huge\r\npotential to contribute in a practical way to the development\r\nof our region and to the world generally. We therefore\r\nwelcome the spirit of dialogue and cooperation between\r\nTaiwan and the People’s Republic of China and hope that\r\nthe international community at large will also be able to\r\nbenefit from such cooperation. Their increased participation\r\nand cooperation in the activities of various international and\r\nregional forums would certainly be welcome.\r\nFiji, as a member of the South Pacific Forum, is\r\npleased that the Republic of Korea has now joined the\r\nForum as a post-Forum dialogue partner. We are confident\r\nthat the Republic of Korea, a rapidly growing economic\r\nPower, can play a very significant role in the development\r\nof the South Pacific region. We welcome the\r\nopportunities that lie ahead. Further, we hope that\r\ninitiatives for talks between the Republic of Korea and\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue.\r\nWe hope that in due course there will be direct dialogue\r\nbetween the two Koreas, leading to their reconciliation\r\nand eventual reunification.\r\nLast month, the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, in which Fiji also participated, was held at\r\nBeijing. We thank the Government and the people of\r\nChina for acting as host to the Conference. Our\r\ndelegation had high praise for the efficient organization of\r\nthe Conference. We welcome the very useful deliberations\r\nthat took place at Beijing. Fiji looks forward to early\r\nimplementation of the Platform of Action so that the ideas\r\ncontained in it may be translated into meaningful activity\r\nfor the betterment of women.\r\nPreoccupation with economic progress should not be\r\nat the expense of continued protection of the environment\r\nand sustainable development. Indeed, good environmental\r\nhousekeeping will encourage economic growth rather than\r\nhinder it.\r\nWhile the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen\r\nas a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and\r\nenvironmental protection, Fiji regrets that a lack of\r\npolitical commitment, coupled with donor fatigue, has\r\nbeen responsible for the failure of most developed\r\ncountries to allocate adequate financial resources to\r\nenable developing countries to tackle the plethora of\r\nproblems associated with environmental degradation.\r\nIf no increased official development assistance is\r\nforthcoming and if the international target of 0.7 per cent\r\nis not met, there will be serious reneging on commitments\r\nmade at Rio. Fiji is especially concerned as a small island\r\ndeveloping State that the more affluent industrialized\r\ncountries should recognize their responsibility towards the\r\ninternational community and take urgent steps to assist\r\nsmall island developing States in implementing the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action. Specifically, the need is\r\nfor international cooperation, technology transfer and\r\nfinancial resources.\r\nThere is also a critical need for access to markets,\r\nacquisition of new technologies, investments and\r\ninstitutional and human resource development by small\r\nisland developing States to enable them to respond more\r\neffectively to the challenge of finding new paths to\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nsustainable development. My Government would urge all\r\nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change to move speedily towards the conclusion\r\nof an effective protocol that would ultimately bring about\r\nimprovements in the global climate system. For front-line\r\nStates such as Fiji, vulnerable as we are to rising sea levels,\r\nhurricanes and other phenomena associated with a worst-\r\ncase scenario of climate change, politics has little to do\r\nwith the reality that our physical survival would be affected\r\nif immediate action to remedy ailments in the world climate\r\nsystem were not taken. In this context, Fiji welcomes the\r\ncommencement of negotiations on the Berlin mandate to\r\nstrengthen the Framework Convention on Climate Change,\r\nwhich got under way in Geneva last August.\r\nAt the first Conference of the Parties to the\r\nConvention, Fiji had expressed its regret that the outcome\r\nof the Conference was minimal. Fiji continues to believe\r\nthat the protocol of the Alliance of Small Island States\r\nshould form the basis of any new instrument aimed at\r\nstrengthening the climate Convention. Further, at the\r\npresent time, no new commitments should attach to\r\ndeveloping countries, given that their overriding priority\r\nwill remain the combatting of poverty. Recognizing that the\r\npresent health of the world’s climate system is a result of\r\nthe detrimental patterns of production and consumption of\r\nthe industrialized countries, those countries should continue\r\nto take the lead in reducing the emission of greenhouse\r\ngases.\r\nFiji welcomes the successful completion of the United\r\nNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. The Agreement produced by the\r\nConference was the culmination of more than two years of\r\nwork by Member countries that participated in it. It will\r\nform yet another important building block in the\r\nprogressive development of international law under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations. Fiji hopes that the\r\nAgreement will lead to the sustainable utilization of the\r\nliving resources of the sea. For its part, Fiji was both\r\nhonoured and privileged to have played a small part in\r\nfacilitating the work of the Conference. We have kept true\r\nto the promise of Ambassador Sikivou that Fiji would play\r\nits part, however humble, in the affairs of this great\r\nAssembly.\r\nAt this time I would like to pay a special tribute to\r\nAmbassador Satya Nandan, under whose guidance as\r\nChairman the Conference completed the difficult task of\r\nweaving together the sometimes competing interests that\r\nunderlie the often complex and technical negotiations that\r\nallowed for an agreement. Ambassador Nandan has done us\r\nproud, and Fiji is indebted to him for his enduring\r\ncontribution.\r\nFiji has followed with keen interest the deliberations\r\nof the Working Group on Indigenous Populations under\r\nthe brilliant stewardship of Mrs. Erica-Irene Daes, under\r\nwhose guidance a draft declaration on the rights of\r\nindigenous peoples has been completed. Fiji believes that\r\nthe draft declaration is comprehensive and contains the\r\nfundamentals that should be part of any instrument that\r\nseeks to address the legitimate concerns and aspirations of\r\nall indigenous peoples. We would urge all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to support efforts to\r\nconclude work leading to early adoption of the draft\r\ndeclaration. However, while the draft declaration is\r\nimportant, Fiji considers that it is now time to give the\r\nfullest recognition at the international level to the rights\r\nof indigenous peoples by commencing negotiations to\r\nconclude as soon as possible a legal covenant on the\r\nsubject. My Government believes that such an instrument\r\nwould be a logical progression following the adoption of\r\nthe draft declaration and would signal that the political\r\nwill to respect the rights of indigenous peoples exists.\r\nDuring the greater part of the life of the United\r\nNations, the strong have dictated to the feeble, the big to\r\nthe small, the mighty to the weak. While there has been\r\nsome semblance of order, it has often been at the expense\r\nof justice and equity. In this context, while the United\r\nNations has been a symbol of hope for people from small\r\ncountries such as mine, much more remains to be done\r\nbefore it can fulfil the promise of promoting human\r\ndignity, improved standards of living and social progress\r\nfor all. That said, however, Fiji’s view is that the United\r\nNations remains the best and most imaginative\r\norganization mankind has yet devised for its survival in\r\npeace, justice and progress.\r\nOn this day, 10 October, which is the silver\r\nanniversary of the independence of Fiji, and on the golden\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we want to share with\r\nthe international community the extraordinary opportunity\r\nto rededicate ourselves to fulfilling the aspirations of the\r\nCharter. The United Nations must continue to advance the\r\ninterests of all mankind by providing a meaningful forum\r\nfor genuine dialogue between the rich and the poor for\r\nthe establishment of conditions for development, and thus\r\nfor peace.\r\nPermit me to conclude with a final walk down\r\nmemory lane. When Fiji’s first Prime Minister, the Right\r\nHonourable Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, now President,\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\naddressed this Assembly on 21 October 1970, he ended his\r\nhistoric address with these words:\r\n“much of the effort of the United Nations has been\r\nconcentrated on improving the material well-being of\r\nthe peoples of the world, and I have just been reading\r\nthe far-reaching and imaginative report of the Second\r\nCommittee setting out a blueprint for the second\r\ndecade of economic development. It may then sound\r\nungrateful for a small country like Fiji, which has so\r\noften been at the receiving end of the bounty, to\r\nquestion this priority. But so many of these schemes,\r\nwelcome as they are, are confined within the\r\nboundaries of one country. Spiritual and moral values,\r\non the other hand, know no frontiers, and by\r\nupholding and encouraging these, we are following a\r\ncourse which is truly international, and which is\r\ncalculated more than anything else to give reality to\r\nthe concept of one world. We do not live by bread\r\nalone, and it is only from the firm base of sound\r\nmoral and spiritual standards that we can go on to\r\nmeaningful economic progress”. (Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Twenty-fifth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 1876th meeting, para. 210)\r\nI would suggest that this advice, given with\r\ncharacteristic humility, as it was then by the architect of\r\nmodern Fiji, is no less powerful today than it was 25 years\r\nago. I recommend it for the further consideration of this\r\ngathering.\r\nAddress by Manuel Saturnino Da Costa, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau.\r\nMr. Manuel Saturnino Da Costa, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Mr.\r\nManuel Saturnino Da Costa, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Saturnino Da Costa (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; interpretation from French text furnished by\r\nthe delegation): On behalf of my country and my\r\nGovernment, Sir, may I first of all extend warmest\r\ncongratulations to you on your election to the presidency of\r\nthis session of the General Assembly, which coincides\r\nwith the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. Your assumption of the presidency of this\r\nsession is a crowning event in a long and brilliant\r\npolitical and diplomatic career, and will undoubtedly\r\nensure the success of our deliberations. It is all the more\r\ngratifying for us to emphasize this fact, since we share\r\nwith your country, Portugal, a historic past of deeply\r\nrooted links of culture and cooperation, which today unite\r\nour peoples and our countries.\r\nWe also extend our congratulations to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire, a country\r\nwith which we have excellent relations of friendship and\r\ncooperation, on the brilliant way in which he guided the\r\nproceedings of the forty-ninth session.\r\nWe also want to take this opportunity to express to\r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, our appreciation for the dynamic way in\r\nwhich he is leading our Organization.\r\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization, and one year after the holding of the first\r\nmultiparty elections in Guinea-Bissau, I feel particularly\r\nhonoured to have the privilege of representing my country\r\nat this historic session of the General Assembly. This\r\nevent offers the international community a special\r\noccasion and an appropriate framework for reaffirming\r\nour full adherence to the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter. A half century after its creation, the United\r\nNations must, more than ever before, be able to confront\r\nnew challenges.\r\nGuinea-Bissau is of the opinion that in order to best\r\nrespond to the needs of the day, our Organization must\r\nundertake urgent and appropriate reforms. I am convinced\r\nthat the political and socio-economic changes taking place\r\non the international scene have repercussions for the\r\nfunctioning of our Organization. It is our profound\r\nconviction that the end of the bipolarization of\r\ninternational relations and the cold war promises better\r\nconditions for the future of our Organization.\r\nThe broad prospects opening up for the process of\r\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in many parts of the\r\nworld are not just a matter of circumstance, but are rather\r\nthe expression of the international community’s\r\nunequivocal will to establish lasting peace.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nIt is in this context that we note with satisfaction that\r\nafter so many efforts made by the international community,\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in\r\nparticular, significant progress has been made in Liberia.\r\nAs far as Angola is concerned, we welcome the way\r\nin which the negotiation process and the implementation of\r\nthe agreements signed in Lusaka have developed. We\r\ncongratulate the people and leaders of the fraternal country\r\nof Mozambique for the exemplary way in which the first\r\nmultiparty elections took place there.\r\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be of serious\r\nconcern to Guinea-Bissau. We urge the parties concerned\r\nto put an end to hostilities, and to continue negotiations\r\nwith a view to achieving national reconciliation.\r\nIn the Middle East, the peace process deserves the\r\nsupport of the international community. We thus welcome\r\nwith satisfaction the progress achieved.\r\nAs regards Jammu and Kashmir, my country urges the\r\nparties to the conflict to find a just and lasting solution.\r\nMy country continues to support the initiatives\r\nregarding negotiations in East Timor, under the auspices of\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, with a view to\r\na just solution.\r\nIn connection with the question of the embargo\r\naffecting Cuba, which has an impact on the population of\r\nthat country, Guinea-Bissau encourages dialogue between\r\nthe parties concerned with a view to a definitive and\r\nsatisfactory solution.\r\nIn the former Yugoslavia, where the international\r\ncommunity has been witness to acts of inhumanity, we can\r\nat last welcome with optimism the progress achieved in the\r\ncourse of negotiations.\r\nAs the international community celebrates the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the establishment of our universal\r\nOrganization, may I, on behalf of my Government, reiterate\r\nour firm conviction that the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nshould form part of the United Nations on the basis of the\r\napplication of the principle of the parallel representation of\r\ndivided countries. In this context, it would be desirable for\r\nthe two countries to participate simultaneously in\r\ninternational activities, with a view to promoting\r\nconstructive contacts and negotiations. Respect for and the\r\nexercise of human rights and pluralist democracy are\r\nfactors in producing national unity and peace, and in\r\npreserving international stability. Guinea-Bissau continues\r\nto endeavour to defend and safeguard this concept, whose\r\nconstant application is vital to development.\r\nGuinea-Bissau continues to work to improve the\r\nmanagement of its economy. The proper implementation\r\nof a structural adjustment programme reflects the constant\r\nconcerns of my Government. I am convinced that in spite\r\nof our own efforts of macroeconomic management to\r\nimprove the well-being of our populations, my country\r\nneeds the support of the international community, with a\r\nview to confronting the many development challenges we\r\nface. The poverty and social injustice suffered by most of\r\nmankind constitute root causes of the conflict, threatening\r\nthe peace and stability of the world; the ideological\r\ntensions of the cold war could, indeed, be replaced by\r\nother crises, especially crises of an economic and\r\nfinancial origin, if urgent measures are not immediately\r\ntaken.\r\nThe threat to the environment is a reality which must\r\nbe urgently combated. The protection of the ecosystem\r\nrequires continued support for the development process of\r\nthe poorest countries. It is for this reason that we believe\r\nthat underdevelopment poses a serious threat to the\r\nenvironment of the African continent. The countries\r\nmembers of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on\r\nDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) are facing grave\r\nproblems of draught and other natural disasters that could\r\nseriously compromise their social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMore than ever before, international cooperation is\r\nbecoming imperative for world peace and for the\r\nprotection and strengthening of human dignity in order to\r\nensure full enjoyment of the rights and aspirations of\r\npresent and future generations. The social development\r\nactivities of the United Nations should focus in particular\r\non the most vulnerable groups, such as women, children,\r\nyoung people, the aged and the disabled.\r\nGuinea-Bissau, which is loyal to the principles of the\r\nCharter, reaffirms its determination to contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\r\nsolemnly reiterates its firm resolve to persevere in that\r\ndirection. In this context, we welcome with pleasure the\r\nresults of the World Summit for Social Development and\r\nof the Fourth World Conference on Women.\r\nGuinea-Bissau’s contribution to the attainment of the\r\npurposes and principles of our Organization is well\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nknown. Our participation in different peace-keeping\r\noperations around the world is the clearest illustration of\r\nthis. We are convinced that the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security is the collective responsibility of all\r\nMember\r\nStates, large and small, in accordance with the principle\r\nof the sovereign equality of States. In this context, my\r\ncountry, Guinea-Bissau, submitted its candidature for a\r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council, which has\r\nbeen endorsed by the African Group. In this regard, I\r\nrequest the support of all Member States.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, the President\r\nthanked the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nGuinea-Bissau for his statement; Mr. Saturnino Da\r\nCosta, Prime Minister of the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
