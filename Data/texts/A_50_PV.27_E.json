(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ould Lekhal\r\n(Mauritania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Finance, Trade and Industry,\r\nForeign Affairs and National Security of Grenada\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Finance, Trade and Industry,\r\nForeign Affairs and National Security of Grenada.\r\nMr. Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nFinance, Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs and\r\nNational Security of Grenada, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance, Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs\r\nand National Security of Grenada, Mr. Keith Mitchell, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Grenada): The world is aware that the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly marks a major\r\nmilestone in the global events that have charted and guided\r\ninternational affairs. My delegation is pleased to be a part\r\nof this world Organization.\r\nMy delegation wishes to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election\r\nto the presidency of the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We take this opportunity also to thank\r\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, for his exceptional performance in the conduct\r\nof the proceedings of the forty-ninth session.\r\nMy delegation wishes to make due mention of the\r\nefforts and achievements of the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His optimism as\r\nhe confronts the challenges that face this Organization\r\nand his determination in his will to find solutions to many\r\nof the daunting problems of a world fraught with political,\r\neconomic and social changes have contributed, in a large\r\nmeasure, to the successes and gains recorded by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe success of the United Nations Mission in Haiti\r\nis one achievement to celebrate, when the duly-elected\r\nPresident, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was reinstated following\r\nthe removal of the military almost a year ago. Democracy\r\nand the rule of law and order are of paramount\r\nimportance to the peoples of the Caribbean region who\r\ncherish freedom, justice and law and order. Grenada\r\ncontinues to support United Nations initiatives undertaken\r\nin collaboration with other hemispheric organizations to\r\nbuild on the processes that are being put in place to\r\nensure sound social and economic development where\r\ndemocracy can flourish.\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nGrenada applauds the ongoing process of\r\ndemocratization in South Africa and supports the initiatives\r\nundertaken by the South African Government, assisted by\r\nthe international community, to enhance the lives of its\r\nentire population.\r\nGrenada welcomes, too, the building of the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East with the expansion of Arab\r\ncontrol over Arab settlements within the West Bank,\r\nalthough it is recognized that much work has yet to be done\r\nif we are to see lasting peace in that region.\r\nMy delegation is hopeful that similar attempts at\r\npeacemaking in the Balkans will result in bringing the\r\nwarring parties together to work out a negotiated settlement\r\nto the conflict.\r\nThe world stands at the threshold of a new era, a time\r\nof great challenges and a time of significant promise. The\r\nchoices that we make will determine whether we experience\r\neconomic, social and political successes or failures. The\r\ninternational economic environment is rapidly being\r\ntransformed as new centres of economic power and new\r\npartnerships are established. Indeed, these new economic\r\nrealities have important implications for the survival of\r\nsmall and vulnerable economies such as Grenada’s, which\r\nare so heavily dependent on a favourable external\r\nenvironment.\r\nIt can hardly be disputed that the traditional economic\r\nand trade relations on which Grenada relied for so long are\r\nnow being threatened and could shortly cease to exist. The\r\nprocess of adjustment to the new hemispheric challenges\r\nresulting from the entry into force of the North American\r\nFree Trade Agreement on 1 January 1994; the conclusion\r\nof the Uruguay Round agreements of the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade; the establishment of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization; the call for the establishment of\r\na free-trade area of the Americas by the year 2005; and the\r\nformation of the Association of Caribbean States will\r\nundoubtedly pose challenges which will require adjustments\r\non the domestic level, particularly on the part of our\r\nmanufacturers.\r\nFurthermore, these recently formed and soon to be\r\nestablished trading blocs will significantly transform the\r\ntrade policy framework in which developing island\r\neconomies will have to operate into the twenty-first century.\r\nWhile these will offer us new trading opportunities,\r\nparticularly in the medium to long term, they will in the\r\nshort term cause us to face many transitional problems,\r\nmainly because of the erosion of preferential access that\r\nwe now enjoy in major markets of the developed world.\r\nIt is in this context, therefore, that Grenada issues a\r\ncall to the developed world to work with us as we\r\nformulate appropriate policy responses to realize the\r\nbenefits from and adjust to the changes in the global\r\ntrading system. It is to be emphasized that the new\r\nEuropean Union regime for bananas, though not in\r\nessence an effect of the Uruguay Round, will result in\r\nmajor losses in export revenue for all the Windward\r\nIslands in the Caribbean. Moreover, the challenge of this\r\nlimited preferential arrangement by some of our closest\r\nallies in the developed world is cause for serious concern.\r\nI must remind this distinguished gathering that the\r\nissue of bananas has much more than economic\r\nsignificance. Indeed, the heavy dependence on this\r\nagricultural commodity by thousands in our islands\r\nmust — I repeat, must — be underscored.\r\nIn fact, the destruction of the banana industry would\r\nlead to serious hardships and could constitute a threat to\r\nour traditionally sound democratic process. Sustainable\r\nhuman development in our small island States could be\r\nseverely threatened.\r\nMy delegation wishes to make it clear that, while\r\nGrenada embraces the philosophy of trade liberalization,\r\ntolerance and an understanding of our cause on the part\r\nof larger economies are necessary. We cannot hope to\r\ndevelop without a significant inflow of technical\r\nassistance, foreign capital and technology.\r\nWe therefore call on the countries in the developed\r\nworld to provide us with this much-needed assistance in\r\norder to ensure that we can participate effectively in this\r\nemerging “New World Trade Order”.\r\nMy delegation will continue to argue that moves\r\ntowards global trade liberalization and reciprocity should\r\ncomplement and not obstruct the efforts of less developed\r\ncountries to implement positive structural reforms.\r\nGrenada, for its part, has already commenced the process\r\nof substantially reducing import tariffs and other barriers.\r\nWhat is now sought is a recognition of these\r\ninitiatives and a negotiating framework in which our\r\nability to achieve greater market access is enhanced,\r\nwhile our economic and financial restructuring can take\r\nplace in a manner and time-frame appropriate to our\r\nspecial circumstances.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nGrenada continues to support the view that special and\r\npreferential treatment cannot continue in perpetuity. But it\r\nmust be recognized that the special needs of the relatively\r\nless developed countries must be taken into account. The\r\nchallenge, therefore, is how to design an acceptable\r\nreciprocal arrangement among unequal partners that will\r\npromote prosperity through free trade and integration in our\r\nworld without endangering the process of sustainable social\r\nand economic development. It is crucial, therefore, that the\r\ndeveloped countries assist the developing world to create\r\ndomestic capabilities that will enhance its capacity to draw\r\nbenefits from trade liberalization and will soften the burden\r\nof adjustment to the new requirements of global free trade.\r\nThe question of the environment and of sustainable\r\neconomic development remains at the heart of our concerns.\r\nIt is also a central issue for small island developing States\r\nin particular, and developing countries in general.\r\nIf we continue to reaffirm that human beings are at the\r\ncentre of sustainable development and that they have a right\r\nto a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature,\r\naction must be taken at all levels and, all the more so, at\r\nthe international level, to facilitate the process. This would\r\nensure that developing countries, and particularly small\r\nisland developing States, are provided with the know-how\r\nand the resources to enable the implementation of the\r\ndecisions and recommendations arising out of the United\r\nNations Conference on the Environment and Development\r\nin Rio in 1992, the United Nations Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates in 1994 in Bridgetown, Barbados and the many other\r\nsignificant global Conferences.\r\nThe vulnerability of small island States and the threat\r\nto our fragile ecosystems were recently manifested by the\r\npassage of hurricanes Iris, Luis and Marilyn. Our economic\r\nviability and sustainable economic growth are indeed at\r\nstake. In this regard, Grenada looks forward to the\r\nfulfilment of pledged commitments by developed countries\r\nto assist small island developing States achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe role of science and technology in development\r\nmust be underscored. My delegation calls upon developed\r\ncountries to provide developing countries with the necessary\r\naccess to biotechnologies to promote and facilitate\r\nsustainable economic growth.\r\nInformation technology and human resource\r\ndevelopment are key elements towards social and economic\r\nprogress — elements which would enable us to improve\r\nour productivity and competitiveness in priority areas as\r\nwe move into the twenty-first century.\r\nThe United Nations was created by men of vision,\r\ncourage and foresight who understood the need for\r\ncooperation among nations and for hope over despair.\r\nUndoubtedly, the United Nations, in its “Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”, has succeeded in bringing to the world’s\r\nattention the need for a re-evaluation of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in development, taking into account such\r\ncritical issues as the empowerment of women, the\r\nalleviation of poverty and hunger and the link between\r\ndevelopment and population, human rights and the\r\ncreation of an environment for world peace and security.\r\nThe social forces of poverty are among the leading\r\ncauses of environmental degradation and a significant\r\ncontributor to the loss of biological diversity. Poverty and\r\nunemployment also contribute to greater social problems,\r\namong which is the illicit traffic in narcotics. Efforts to\r\neradicate the traffic in illicit drugs can have little effect at\r\nthe national and international levels unless commitments\r\nare made and agreements are entered into to develop\r\nprogrammes aimed at the alleviation of poverty.\r\nMy delegation is hopeful that the follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, held in\r\nCopenhagen in March this year, will embrace those\r\nprinciples which call for social inclusion and which\r\nfacilitate the development of strategies to ensure that\r\nyouth, the disabled and the elderly play a more\r\nmeaningful role in social and economic development.\r\nIndeed, the Fourth World Conference on Women,\r\nwhich ended only last month in Beijing, has given\r\nimpetus to the need for programmes that speak to the\r\nissues of women in development and, most critically, the\r\nempowerment of women in local communities, enabling\r\ntheir full participation at all levels in the process of\r\nnational development.\r\nGrenada is encouraged by the new spirit of\r\ninternational cooperation built on a shared partnership\r\nbetween multilateral financial institutions and\r\nGovernments. However, the models suggested for\r\neconomic development have not been sufficiently tested\r\nand are often ill-suited to meet the needs of the society in\r\nwhich they are applied, sometimes resulting in disastrous\r\nsocial and economic consequences.\r\nWhile we seek to put in place all the necessary\r\nmeasures to ensure the efficient and effective management\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nof our domestic affairs, we strongly urge multilateral\r\ninstitutions to include in these models for development a\r\ncomponent that provides skills training and, in particular,\r\ntraining in the use of technologies to enable young people\r\nto find productive employment in the private sector and to\r\nfacilitate the process towards equitable social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation also supports the United Nations\r\nresponse to security and international humanitarian needs\r\nand encourages greater emphasis on human-rights\r\nmonitoring.\r\nWe live in an era of changing norms and of emerging\r\nnations and democracies, where no institution or country\r\ncan stand alone. In this connection, the reforms currently\r\nbeing undertaken within the United Nations system should\r\nyield more positive results — greater collaboration and\r\ncooperation on issues, rather than confrontation and\r\ndisunity. New, emerging economic nations or Powers are\r\neager to take their rightful place in institutions and agencies\r\nonce dominated by traditional super-Powers.\r\nGrenada also believes that in this era of reform and\r\nrestructuring within the United Nations due consideration\r\nshould be given to a composition of the Security Council\r\nthat reflects the geopolitical and economic realities of our\r\ntime.\r\nOn this auspicious occasion, as we celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, let us reaffirm\r\nour commitment to the principles of the Charter which\r\nguides this Organization. Grenada not only wishes to\r\nemphasize adherence to these principles, but has worked to\r\nestablish conditions under which all peoples may exercise\r\ntheir equal and inalienable rights.\r\nIn his opening statement the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fiftieth session stated:\r\n“the United Nations has ceased to be an\r\nintergovernmental organization with a limited\r\nmembership and has become the only international\r\norganization that is universal. Efforts must be made to\r\nensure that all States that are not yet Members should\r\nseek to be admitted in the near future. For the same\r\nreason, the most serious penalty imposed on a\r\nMember State should never be expulsion, but rather\r\nsuspension”\r\nfor an indefinite period\r\n“, for the United Nations must, as a matter of\r\nprinciple, include all the world’s countries.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 1st meeting, p. 7)\r\nBut as we meet today the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan and its more than 21 million people remain\r\nexcluded from participation and representation in the\r\nUnited Nations. It is on the basis of that principle of\r\nuniversality that Grenada urges all Members to consider\r\nthat, in renewing our oaths, we should forthwith seek to\r\nright this wrong. The inclusion of the Republic of China\r\nwill be an added contribution to global cooperation in\r\nfields such as trade, economic development,\r\nenvironmental protection, sustainable development and\r\nmultilateral efforts to fight drug trafficking. Moreover, the\r\nRepublic of China is committed to the promotion of\r\ninternational development assistance to developing\r\ncountries.\r\nGrenada wishes to urge again that an ad hoc\r\ncommittee be set up at the earliest possible time to\r\nconsider the special case of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan and respond positively to its wish to join this\r\nworld Organization.\r\nMy delegation is confident that improved\r\ncooperation between developed and developing countries\r\nand the consolidation of related agencies and programmes\r\nwould lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of\r\nsolutions to global problems and for the promotion of\r\nsustainable economic, social and cultural development.\r\nAs we look forward to celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Untied Nations, and as individual\r\nnations formulate plans and strategies to move into the\r\ntwenty-first century, which poses as many challenges as\r\nit presents opportunities, let us recommit ourselves to the\r\nnoble principles of the Charter, guided by the spirit of\r\npartnership and cooperation, ever united in our efforts to\r\nachieve peace, democracy and prosperity for all our\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance, Trade and\r\nIndustry, Foreign Affairs and National Security of\r\nGrenada for the important statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Keith C. Mitchell, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Finance, Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nand National Security of Grenada, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs, Trade, Industry and\r\nCARICOM Affairs of Saint Lucia, His Excellency Mr.\r\nWilliam George Mallet, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Mallet (Saint Lucia): The island State of Saint\r\nLucia shares the sense of history and the mantle of\r\nresponsibility that falls over the General Assembly on this,\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations.\r\nWe must exult in the realization that a vague dream of\r\npeace in the aftermath of a world war has in five decades\r\nfirmed into a solid commitment by 185 nations to shoulder\r\nthe burden of the global community, embracing every\r\naspect of life around the world.\r\nThe elevation of Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfiftieth session is a distinct honour to his country and a\r\ntimely recognition of the high esteem in which he is held\r\nby his colleagues in the international arena.\r\nDuring this dramatic and exciting half century the\r\nGeneral Assembly has had its task cut out for it as it has\r\nbeen called upon to deal with disruptions arising from\r\nhuman failing, and often from human folly, which have\r\nthreatened to obstruct the path towards the fulfilment of the\r\nideals of the United Nations. However, some of the\r\nOrganization’s finest moments have occurred in this half\r\ncentury — none more historic than when we presided over\r\nthe liquidation of apartheid and saw established the\r\nmultiracial State of South Africa. We have seen the end of\r\nthe conflict in Namibia, with the hope that this brings for\r\nthe economic and social progress of its people. We have\r\nmonitored the collapse of the Berlin wall. We have seen\r\ndemocracy in Haiti. We have been able to deter aggression\r\naimed at fulfilling territorial ambitions, even while we have\r\nbeen able to encourage the prospects for peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nAny inclination that we may have nurtured towards\r\nself-congratulation is, however, arrested by events like the\r\nslaughter in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda, the\r\n“ethnic cleansing” operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand the seeming difficulty of ending the conflict. We are\r\nreminded by these events of the task that still lies ahead of\r\nus in fulfilling the dream of a better world.\r\nMr. Peerthum (Mauritius), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe take pride in speaking of the equality of Member\r\nnations irrespective of size, and indeed have gone a long\r\nway towards ensuring such equality. We have admired\r\nhow extremely large and very small nations have had the\r\nopportunity to contribute equally to the deliberations of\r\nthe Assembly and to its decision-making process. There\r\nare however a number of impediments which still militate\r\nagainst smaller nations such as ours.\r\nThe confrontational posture of the cold war had\r\ngiven a strategic prominence to small States, then useful\r\nas pawns in the global chess game between super-Powers.\r\nNow that the small States have outlived their usefulness\r\nas honest brokers in the super-Power game, the altered\r\npolitical circumstances have left them stranded and\r\nmarginalized.\r\nThe pious promises of the developed world to\r\nallocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the\r\nprovision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to\r\nnon-fulfilment; the thought of the strong economies\r\nhelping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun.\r\nSaint Lucia has experienced a dramatic decline in\r\ngrant assistance — by almost 50 per cent between the\r\nfinancial years 1993-1994 and 1994-1995; but we can ill\r\nafford to sit around and merely moan. We recognize and\r\naccept that we must use the fact of diminished aid to\r\nincreasingly spur on our own efforts towards greater\r\nefficiency and increased productivity. But in striving\r\ntowards the achievement of this end, we find ourselves up\r\nagainst multinational trading interests intent on adding to\r\nthe maw of their already well-nourished entities the\r\nmorsels of trade on which the survival of our economy\r\ndepends.\r\nThe European Union banana regime came into force\r\nin June 1993 as part of the process of creating a single\r\nEuropean market, replacing a series of long-standing\r\nnational arrangements between individual member States\r\nand traditional banana suppliers. The United States itself\r\nhas led the way in instituting various national and\r\ninternational arrangements in the interests of its own\r\nfarming community. The existing banana regime seeks to\r\nensure that demand for bananas across the European\r\nUnion is satisfied, while at the same time providing\r\ntraditional suppliers of bananas to Europe from\r\ndeveloping countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the\r\nPacific with continued access to the European market at\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nviable price levels. In doing so the European Union fulfils\r\na legal commitment under the Lomé Convention, that is\r\nthat the introduction of the single market should place\r\ntraditional suppliers in no worse a position than in the past.\r\nThat is achieved by a combination of tariff quotas and\r\nlicences which ensure that suppliers from the African,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific States (ACP) maintain — but cannot\r\nincrease — their market share of approximately 15 per cent\r\nof the total European Union demand for bananas. This\r\nfacility is not aimed at victimizing United States firms or\r\nindeed firms of any particular nationality. This is clearly\r\ndemonstrated by the fact that over 60 per cent of the\r\nEuropean Union’s market demand for bananas is satisfied\r\nby fruit imported from Central and South America,\r\nprincipally by three United States multinationals. It is\r\nimportant to note that the Caribbean’s share of the world\r\nmarket for bananas is a paltry 3 per cent compared to the\r\nmore than 70 per cent share of dollar bananas, mostly\r\ncontrolled by these multinationals.\r\nThere is general nervousness and a creeping instability\r\nthreatening the Caribbean banana-growing States resulting\r\nfrom the decision of the United States Trade Representative\r\nto pursue Section 301 action in response to an application\r\nby Chiquita Brands International and the Hawaii Banana\r\nIndustry Association challenging the European banana\r\nimport regime. We have since been advised that the United\r\nStates Government is to pursue a complaint against the\r\nregime within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since\r\nthe banana industry accounts for about 50 per cent of the\r\ndomestic exports of the Windward Islands and around 90\r\nper cent of all agricultural earnings in Saint Lucia and\r\nDominica, it is indisputable that the collapse of the industry\r\nwhich would accompany any tampering with the regime\r\nwould have a disastrous impact on the economies of these\r\nvery small countries.\r\nIn addition, the interdependence of Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) trading arrangements would, in\r\nthe circumstances, produce a ripple of economic downturn\r\nand accompanying social unrest and political instability\r\nthroughout the CARICOM region. The resulting prospect of\r\nmassive unemployment, displaced family wage earnings and\r\nan escalation in criminal and drug activity is too horrific to\r\ncontemplate. The Caribbean must call on the good sense\r\nand high ideals of this body to use whatever influence it\r\nhas at its disposal to avert this looming danger. The United\r\nNations may well consider it useful to develop a framework\r\nof international review and regulation with respect to the\r\nactivities and policies of transnational corporations, which\r\nare becoming increasingly influential actors on the world\r\nscene.\r\nThere is little need to emphasize the openness and\r\nvulnerability of Caribbean economies. We are exposed to\r\nthe fury of natural disasters, as was evidenced by the\r\nhavoc wrought by Tropical Storm Debbie, from which\r\nSaint Lucia is still recovering; the recent demolition of\r\nAntigua and Saint Kitts by Hurricane Luis; and the\r\ndevastation of St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. Maarten and\r\nDominica by Hurricane Marilyn.\r\nWith severe limitations of size and resources, we are\r\nnow called upon to come to terms with changes brought\r\nabout by the process of liberalization and its requirement\r\nto be competitive globally; we are therefore forced to\r\ndiversify our interests in reaction to the liberalization and\r\nderegulation processes which are taking place in the\r\ninternational marketplace. The classical response calls for\r\nrestructuring aimed at economic diversification,\r\naccompanied of course by increasing efficiency and\r\nproductivity.\r\nIn terms of diversification the services sector holds\r\nattractions. In this context many of our countries are\r\nanxious to explore the field of offshore financial services\r\nto enhance the Governments’ revenue base. We are,\r\nhowever, alert to the dangers associated with that sector\r\nand, while pursuing the benefits to be derived from such\r\ninstitutions, we must be ever on guard for white-collar\r\ncriminals who, as part of their everyday activity, launder\r\ntheir ill-gotten gains through the international financial\r\nsystems, using both public- and private-sector capital\r\nprojects for this purpose. Quite often the strategies\r\nemployed by quasi-investors to launder their wealth are\r\nboth innovative and sophisticated and require equally\r\nsophisticated systems to deal with their ingenious\r\nmalpractices. Our growing States are not yet able to\r\nacquire the kind of resources to engage in a full-fledged\r\nwar against such nefarious institutions.\r\nAdmittedly, the 1988 United Nations Vienna\r\nConvention has sought to criminalize the laundering of\r\nmoney derived from the illicit drug trade. But it is crucial\r\nthat our countries in the Caribbean area take a positive\r\nstand to enforce the law and protect our communities\r\nfrom these destructive practices. In this context,\r\ninternational financial institutions should use their\r\ninfluence, through moral suasion, to encourage member\r\ncountries, as a matter of urgency, to adopt the measures\r\nnecessary to achieve the objectives of the 40\r\nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force. In\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nthe Caribbean area our CARICOM colleagues will no doubt\r\nembrace the nineteen recommendations of the Caribbean\r\nFinancial Action Task Force.\r\nIn the course of the year, our country attracted some\r\nattention in respect of irregularities surrounding the use of\r\nthe Pérez-Guerrero Trust Fund. We did not flinch from the\r\ncostly decision to appoint a full commission of inquiry in\r\nour anxiety to ensure the fullest possible accountability. In\r\nthese trying times, when cynics are ready to decry the\r\nachievements of the United Nations and besmirch its\r\nidealism, it is the bounden duty of all Member States to\r\nwash off the stains of calumny and allow the ideals,\r\nprinciples and performance of this illustrious body to\r\ncontinue to inspire the world. The Phillips Commission\r\ncleared both the Saint Lucia Government and the organs of\r\nthe United Nations of any complicity or blame in the affair.\r\nThis experience, however, points to the need for being on\r\nconstant guard against those who without scruples would\r\nseek to compromise the traditions and the integrity of\r\ngovernment and of this body.\r\nThe end of the cold war has left many countries\r\nstranded on the beachhead of marginalization. In the\r\ncontext of the Caribbean, we are learning to deal with our\r\nisolation by exploring new internal alliances designed to\r\nfoster pride in our patrimony, reduce our vulnerability, pool\r\nour human resources and intensify our self-reliance. The\r\nlogic of this internationalization is to strengthen the links\r\nbetween us in the Eastern Caribbean, within the context of\r\nthe Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), even\r\nwhile we consolidate the process of the closer integration\r\nof the Caribbean Community. The circle of integration\r\nexpands in a growing relationship with countries in the\r\nwider Caribbean basin and the countries of Latin America.\r\nThis new thrust of integration has found expression in the\r\nrecently established Association of Caribbean States, which\r\nlinks the countries of Central and South America, as well\r\nas other Caribbean countries such as Haiti, the Dominican\r\nRepublic and Cuba. We will, however, within the Lomé\r\nConvention, maintain our long and valuable historical links\r\nwith Europe even while, by implementing the decisions of\r\nthe Summit of the Americas, we seek to expand and\r\nconsolidate our hemispheric ties.\r\nThis new Caribbean initiative has much to recommend\r\nit. The concept cuts clear across the barriers of race,\r\nlanguage and culture to establish a market of 204 million\r\npeople with an annual trade volume of $180 billion and\r\nestablishes a regional base from which competitive strength\r\nmay be developed for dealing in the global arena.\r\nIn the case of Haiti, we can now look hopefully\r\nforward with new confidence to the restoration of\r\ndemocracy in an environment of peace and stability. The\r\nnew setting should pave the way for the Haitian people’s\r\nachievement of economic, social and political well-being.\r\nThe re-establishment of democratic order leaves Haiti\r\npoised to play a greater role, in concert with its\r\nCARICOM colleagues, in helping shape the new\r\ninternational order. The United States of America, the\r\nCARICOM grouping and the United Nations itself can\r\nfeel satisfied over and take pride in the fact that their\r\nsustained interest and cooperation have led to the\r\npromotion of Haiti’s rehabilitation and economic\r\ndevelopment. Saint Lucia renews its commitment to\r\nsupport the consolidation of the hard-won gains in Haiti\r\nin the hope that the country will finally enjoy the fruits of\r\ndemocracy, with full respect accorded the inalienable\r\nrights of its people.\r\nIn the case of Cuba, we are firmly convinced that\r\nthe cause of democracy can best be served by the\r\ndiffusion of its values through association and example\r\nand not in a process of isolation. That is why Saint Lucia\r\njoins its Caribbean colleagues in calling for an end to the\r\neconomic blockade of Cuba so as to allow that Caribbean\r\ncountry the flexibility to develop the creativity of its\r\npeople and pursue its Caribbean destiny.\r\nThe winds of change which blew across Africa in\r\nthe fifties were fuelled by a strong pan-Africanism. It is\r\ngenerally known that the ideas which generated the\r\nliberation struggles in Africa came out of the cross-\r\nfertilization of the ideas of African and Caribbean\r\nthinkers. Caribbean thinkers like Saint Lucia’s Nobel\r\nlaureate, Sir Arthur Lewis, and others, such as C.L.R.\r\nJames and George Padmore, were strong influences on\r\npersons like Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta and Sékou\r\nTouré. This historic link between the Caribbean and\r\nAfrica must continue, especially at a time when the entire\r\ninternational community is deeply concerned about the\r\ncritical economic and political conditions in Africa as a\r\nwhole. Our Secretary-General has openly expressed his\r\ndeep concern for the problems of Africa and the need for\r\nthis body to give them its urgent consideration.\r\nAt its fiftieth session, the General Assembly must\r\nact in concert with the Secretary-General in giving high\r\npriority to programmes of action for African recovery and\r\ndevelopment. The United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s must be pursued\r\nurgently and vigorously. In this anniversary year, Saint\r\nLucia will pursue a conscious policy of establishing\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\ndiplomatic relations with a number of African countries,\r\nwith a view not only to stimulating trade and cultural\r\nexchanges, but, indeed, to recovering and stimulating that\r\nvital interchange of ideas.\r\nSaint Lucia is strongly supportive of the peace process\r\nin the Middle East, which started with the signing on\r\n4 May 1994 of the first implementation agreement of the\r\nDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\r\nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization. The second phase of the agreement\r\nwas signed on 28 September this year. The agreement\r\nbetween Israel and Jordan has deepened the process\r\nconsiderably. It is our fervent hope that the skirmishes\r\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis will not derail the\r\npeace process in the Middle East. We further urge the\r\ncountries of the region to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons for the long-term stability\r\nand development of the region.\r\nIn preceding sessions of the Assembly, my country has\r\ndrawn attention to the Republic of China on Taiwan’s\r\nrequest to take its rightful place within this family of\r\nnations. Our support for this request in no way implies an\r\nattack on the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of\r\nChina, nor is it meant to vitiate the intention of resolution\r\n2758 (XXVI).\r\nMy country is acutely aware of the need to protect the\r\nfundamental principles of our institutions, but it is not\r\nbeyond the creativity of the Assembly to play a catalyst\r\nrole in resolving the impasse between the Republic of\r\nChina and the People’s Republic of China. Recent military\r\nmanoeuvres in the Taiwan Straits provide an eerie warning\r\nof the possibility of deteriorating relations between the two\r\ncountries. The Assembly should not wash its hands of the\r\nissues like Pilate, but should exhaust the possibilities of\r\npreventive diplomacy rather than live to bemoan the tragedy\r\nof inaction.\r\nSaint Lucia continues to be of the view that Taiwan’s\r\npresence in the United Nations will help to further the goals\r\nand ideals of our Organization. Saint Lucia’s support for\r\nTaiwan’s bid for a seat in this body is in the knowledge\r\nthat this does not preclude the eventuality of reunification.\r\nAs we stand on the threshold of a new century, at the\r\nvery same time as we are presented with an anniversary\r\nopportunity to look back on a half-century of United\r\nNations activity, two vital processes loom large in the\r\nperception of small States. These processes are\r\ndisarmament and decolonization.\r\nIt is our wish that the process of arms reduction\r\ncontinue to gain momentum and to stabilize at a level that\r\nwill ensure the easing of tensions and conflicts whenever\r\nand wherever they are waged around the globe. Attention\r\nmust be focused on those countries which devote large\r\nslices of their national budgets to arms purchases and\r\nproduction while numerous areas of the world languish in\r\npoverty and disease. Civil and external wars could occur\r\nin regions where the possession of advanced weaponry,\r\nsuch as medium-range missiles with chemical, biological\r\nor even nuclear warheads, by ambitious and threatened\r\nregimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect. The search\r\nfor peace is the most compelling rationale for the\r\nexistence of the United Nations, and the indefinite\r\nextension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, together with\r\ncomplete disarmament and the total eradication of\r\nchemical weapons, will be the greatest global contribution\r\nto a new world order. Saint Lucia has already ratified the\r\nTreaty of Tlatelolco for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nWith regard to the process of decolonization, the\r\ntarget date of the year 2000 set by the United Nations for\r\nthe total eradication of colonialism is to be borne in mind.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations should continue to\r\npromote the idea that referendums and other forms of\r\npopular consultation on the future status of the Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories are appropriate means of\r\nascertaining the wishes of the people in this matter.\r\nAs the United Nations has grown in scope and\r\ncomplexity over these past 50 years, so too have the\r\nproblems and complexities assumed new dimensions. We\r\nhave seen floods of refugees escaping civil wars all over\r\nthe globe, but now we are faced with the prospect of\r\nenvironmental refugees fleeing from disaster areas and\r\nnatural catastrophes. Without wishing to sound like a\r\nprophet of doom, I must say that the possible effect of\r\nglobal warming upon agriculture in the developing world\r\nis a further cause of concern. In recent months we have\r\nfaced the relentless fury of hurricanes, rising sea levels\r\nand, in the case of Montserrat, one of our small\r\nCaribbean island neighbours, the threat of volcanic\r\neruption.\r\nWe appreciate that these unfolding problems have\r\nnot escaped the attention of the United Nations. The\r\nforty-second session of the General Assembly designated\r\nthe 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster\r\nReduction, and a Plan of Action was adopted in May\r\n1994 by the World Conference on Natural Disaster\r\nReduction. Our small countries view the transfer of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\ntechnology in respect of early warning systems, monitoring\r\ndevices and up-to-date research on safer construction\r\nmethods as a matter of urgent priority. While we are\r\ngrateful for the short-term assistance given to such disaster\r\nareas, it is vital that we should also focus on the long-term\r\ngoals of preparedness and prevention.\r\nThe question of equitable representation and an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council was\r\nincluded in the agenda of the thirty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in 1979, the same year Saint Lucia\r\njoined this Organization, and the same year that the\r\nmembership of the United Nations was tripled, from 51\r\noriginal members to 152 members.\r\nDuring the 16 years since 1979 we have been calling\r\nfor an increase in the membership of the Security Council,\r\nespecially of developing countries, to reflect the increased\r\nmembership of the United Nations and the reality of its\r\ncomposition. Repetition is necessary to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the point that the policy-making arm of the\r\nUnited Nations should reflect the diversity and universality\r\nof the membership of this body and uphold the principle of\r\nequitable representation that the Charter embodies.\r\nSaint Lucia continues to support the recommendation\r\nthat the relationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council should be strengthened. We also support\r\nthe view that the process of briefing and consultation\r\nshould be institutionalized, that the privilege of veto should\r\nbe phased out and that the efforts at developing greater\r\ntransparency and predictability should continue. Saint Lucia\r\nwill work with and support the efforts of our regional group\r\nand of the Non-Aligned Movement to achieve these\r\nobjectives. It is our hope that, in this fiftieth year, we shall\r\nexercise the courage and willingness needed to bring about\r\nthe overdue changes and reform of the Council.\r\nSaint Lucia has taken the opportunity of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary to reflect deeply on the role of small\r\nmarginalized States in the family of nations. We have\r\nendured the ravages of a colonial past, been exploited by\r\nmultinational corporations, divided by the sea and\r\nhamstrung by a desperate shortage of resources.\r\nToday a new vision unfolds. We cannot hope to\r\nconquer worlds as the early Conquistadors did. There are\r\nno worlds to conquer, but worlds to recreate. In this\r\nrecreation of the post-cold-war world, there are\r\ndisappearing divisions between States once sworn enemies\r\nin a drive to adjust to the dictates of the new world\r\neconomic order. The interdependence of nations is\r\nhighlighted against the background of diseases which\r\nthreaten the world, and the potential for destruction of the\r\nvery environment which guarantees the survival of\r\nmankind.\r\nThese problems to be resolved must be approached\r\nthrough the collective means available within this body.\r\nHowever, solutions to be effective must take account of\r\ndifferences in size, in resources and in the cultural\r\ndiversity of those who are to benefit from them.\r\nPracticality must take precedence over mere dogma,\r\nand idealism must not be allowed to lose ground to a\r\nnarrowness of realism that pays little heed to\r\ncircumstances. Saint Lucia sees the United Nations as a\r\nsolid bulwark for the creation of a new order. Its\r\ncommitment to world peace, human rights, gender\r\nequality, racial equality and sustainable development for\r\nthe peoples of the world is the touchstone of our\r\naspirations.\r\nMy country stands prepared to assist in the retooling\r\nand reshaping of the organs of the United Nations to\r\nenable it to face the global challenges which lie ahead of\r\nus. These challenges are as demanding of Member States\r\nas they are of the organs of the United Nations. Our focus\r\nwill be to work in concert with our colleagues in the\r\nCaribbean Community and our colleagues in the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States to increase our efficiency\r\nand productivity with a view to playing a full role in the\r\ninternational arena. We will explore with other Member\r\nStates ideas for fostering a new ethos in the international\r\nforum, in which size, wealth and influence will be\r\nsubordinated to the concourse of ideas.\r\nFinally, Saint Lucia will endeavour to join the global\r\nsearch for a more relevant and edifying system of values\r\nwhich will inspire generations of young people to\r\nembrace the concerns which five decades ago motivated\r\nthe founding fathers of this noble Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call upon the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Sudan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha.\r\nMr. Taha (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express to the President my\r\nwarmest congratulations on his election to guide the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that his wealth of experience will make it\r\npossible for this session to achieve its noble goals. I\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nshould like to pledge the full support and cooperation of\r\nSudan to that end.\r\nAllow me also to express my great appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, the President of the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire, for his\r\nimmensely valuable contribution to the work of the United\r\nNations. I would also like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his continuous endeavours in fulfilling his\r\nfunctions.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly acquires a\r\nspecial importance because half a century in the lifetime of\r\nthe Organization calls upon us to pause for contemplation\r\nand self-criticism. We should do that because we look\r\nforward to the United Nations becoming the body that\r\nguarantees peaceful coexistence amongst States, the light\r\nthat guides States in important issues and the effective\r\ninstrument for consolidating international cooperation.\r\nThe philosophy upon which the United Nations was\r\nestablished was one that aimed at reflecting the progress\r\nhumanity had achieved towards the state of civilization.\r\nHowever, actual experience has fallen short of that\r\naspiration. In our view, this falling short has been due to\r\ncertain practices by means of which some have tried to use\r\nthe Organization as a tool to impose their hegemony and\r\ninfluence, so that their own outlook and values may become\r\nthe sole, compulsory statute of the international community,\r\nregardless of any diversity of cultures, beliefs, or heritage.\r\nIt behoves us to agree, however, that our world is made up\r\nof a fabric of diversity, and that such diversity, at no time\r\nin history, has been a source of conflict but, rather, a source\r\nof rich and valuable contributions to the gains made by\r\nmankind. Instead of undermining that diversity or using it\r\nas a pretext for strife and conflict, it would have been wiser\r\nto make it a basis for constructive dialogue and the\r\nconsolidation of tolerance and justice in the world.\r\nThe United Nations has led humanity towards new\r\nhorizons in the half century that has elapsed since its\r\nestablishment. This necessitates a reconsideration of its\r\nsystem and mechanisms, given the vast expansion in its\r\nmembership, its new responsibilities and the emergence of\r\nnew international economic and political blocs and systems\r\nthat were not in existence when the United Nations was\r\nfounded. Top priority in such an endeavour should be\r\naccorded to the need to reform the Security Council, in\r\nview of the role expected from it in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe considerations we have mentioned are\r\ncompelling reasons for expanding Security Council\r\nmembership in order to ensure equitable representation of\r\nthe developing countries. It is also necessary to reform\r\nthe procedures of the Council, to ensure transparency and\r\nclarity in its work, to reform its decision-making\r\nmechanism and to develop equitable criteria that would\r\nguide its policies and safeguard it against the pitfall of\r\ndouble-standard and the effects of the ambitions of\r\nhegemony and domination of any of its members.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations should also\r\ninclude reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, which\r\nhave come to be used as tools for the implementation of\r\nstrategies that are designed to entrench hegemony over\r\nthe developing countries. Therefore, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions are required to return to their mandate, which\r\nstipulate their role in the promotion of a balanced\r\ndevelopment and support for the monetary and financial\r\npolicies of all countries without exception or\r\ndiscrimination. We also concur in the call for a review of\r\nthose institutions in the light of the economic and\r\nfinancial factors which have come to prevail in today’s\r\nworld as a result of the emergence of new groups and\r\ncountries whose economic weight enables them to exert\r\nconsiderable influence on international trade and on the\r\nflow of financial resources and capital.\r\nToday’s world also faces a number of economic and\r\nsocial crises as a result of the fractious economic relations\r\nbetween North and South, the inequitable terms of trade\r\nand the ever-expanding gap between rich and poor\r\ncountries. Those crises are exacerbated by the dominance\r\nof consumerism and the undermining of the moral values\r\nthat uphold the dignity of man and preserve the social\r\nfabric. Those are moral values which inspired all cultures\r\nand civilizations. Accordingly, the objectives of balanced\r\ndevelopment should be formulated on a basis of respect\r\nfor those values and principles in order for these\r\nobjectives to be conducive to resolving the crises and\r\nmaintaining balance in social, political, cultural, and\r\neconomic relations in the world community.\r\nIn this regard, we should mention the debt problem\r\nthat has become a major concern for developing\r\ncountries, especially the African. The indebtedness of the\r\nAfrican countries had doubled in the past 10 years to a\r\nrecord $270 billion, with a debt-servicing tag that\r\nconsumes about 35 per cent of the gross national product\r\nof those countries. As expected, the heavy debt burden\r\nand debt-servicing tag have had serious consequences\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nwhich impede development efforts and obstruct economic\r\nstructural reforms.\r\nOn the other hand, the industrial countries have taken\r\nno responsible initiative to address this problem. Instead,\r\nthey called for a case-by-case approach on a bilateral basis.\r\nThis reinforces the impression that the purpose is the\r\nimposition of a political agenda. The result has been\r\nparalysis of the economies of African States, collapse of\r\ntheir infrastructures, and, consequently the eruption of\r\ninternal and regional conflicts all over the continent, which\r\nhave impeded Africa’s efforts to achieve growth and\r\ninternal stability. Therefore, the linking of peace-keeping,\r\nhumanitarian assistance and long-term sustainable\r\ndevelopment is a principle that we welcome and support.\r\nSudan has been following with deep concern the\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Bosnian\r\npeople have continued to be victims of “ethnic cleansing”\r\nand extermination. While we reiterate our support for the\r\npeople and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we\r\ncall upon the international community to continue its efforts\r\nto put an end to the genocide that targets this people and\r\nwe commend the efforts deployed by all those countries\r\nthat support or are engaged in the search for a just, lasting\r\nand comprehensive settlement to this problem.\r\nThe situation in the Gulf is of special importance to us\r\nnot only because it affects our peace and stability, but also\r\nbecause of the deeply rooted historical and cultural ties and\r\nrelationships which strongly bind my country to that region.\r\nWe look forward to the return of peace amongst our\r\nbrothers in the Gulf. In this respect, we have welcomed\r\nIraq’s official recognition of the sovereignty and territorial\r\nboundaries of the State of Kuwait in accordance with the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and Iraq’s undertaking\r\nto cooperate in resolving the outstanding problems between\r\nthe two States, on the one hand, and between Iraq and the\r\nSecurity Council, on the other. We call on all parties to\r\nabide by these measures in order to guarantee Kuwait’s\r\nlegitimate right to existence and sovereignty and the right\r\nto security and stability to its people and leadership. By the\r\nsame token, we call for the lifting of the embargo imposed\r\non Iraq, which no longer has any legal justification as the\r\ngrounds it was built on no longer obtain. The embargo has\r\nnow become a political ploy aimed at starving the Iraqi\r\npeople, humiliating it and fragmenting its territory.\r\nIn the same context, Sudan has been following, with\r\ngreat dismay and disapprobation, the continuation of the\r\nunjust sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nwhile the Jamahiriya has spared no effort in trying to deal\r\nwith the dispute over the Lockerbie crisis by every\r\nacceptable legal means. It is our opinion that the initiative\r\nby the League of Arab States, to which the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya subscribes, is a practical basis for addressing\r\nthe situation in a manner that would lead to the lifting of\r\nthe sanctions.\r\nAs for the Palestinian question, it is our belief that\r\npeace should be based on the criteria of justice and full\r\nrespect for all the rights of the Palestinian and Arab\r\npeoples of the region. Consequently, the return of all the\r\nSyrian Golan Heights to Syria, and Israel’s full and\r\nunconditional withdrawal from southern Lebanon,\r\nAl-Quds and all the other occupied Arab territories, are\r\nessential requirements for the achievement of any stable\r\nlasting settlement.\r\nWe are advocates of peace, stability and good-\r\nneighbourliness. Our abiding conviction has been that the\r\nHorn of Africa is a region that has suffered most, without\r\nany objective justification from internal civil strife and\r\ninstability. We concur with the view that the peoples of\r\nthe subregion should focus on the need to achieve\r\nsecurity and stability. Indeed, this is an objective that we\r\nhave worked for through many a practical initiative that\r\nwe put forward as members of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the International Authority\r\non Drought and Development (IGADD). Notwithstanding\r\nthe high hopes we had in that direction, the results have\r\nfallen short of the very minimum of our aspirations,\r\nbecause some have been seduced by grand strategies\r\nwhose aim has been the destabilization of the region. It is\r\nregrettable that some seem to find it difficult indeed to\r\nabide by the behests of international legality or even to\r\nrespect the norms of international law. It is equally\r\nregrettable that such quarters find it difficult to abide by\r\nthe principles of good-neighbourliness and peaceful\r\ncoexistence and turn, instead, to subversion and terrorism\r\nagainst my country publicly embrace and give haven to\r\nelements of armed opposition.\r\nMy country supports the initiatives aimed at\r\npromoting and strengthening regional organizations and\r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention and settlement, and\r\nurges that such mechanisms should adhere to the\r\nobjectives they were introduced to achieve and abide by\r\nthe rules that govern their activities. It is our opinion that\r\nthe functions of such mechanisms should be, above all\r\nelse, preventive and that they should discharge such\r\nfunctions impartially. They should intervene in conflicts\r\nonly when it is necessary to do so, with the consent of\r\nthe parties concerned, and their activities should be\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nlimited to peaceful handling. They should also preserve\r\ntheir regional nature, so that they do not become extensions\r\nof other parallel mechanisms or tentacles of strategies that\r\naim at international hegemony.\r\nAs regards our immediate neighbours, allow me to\r\nreciprocate, and to extend similar greetings to the brotherly\r\npeople of Egypt, and to express our conviction that only the\r\ntruth will prevail and that the situation in Egypt will return\r\nto its normal course, away from all policies of repression,\r\ndomination and terrorism. There is no doubt that relations\r\nbetween Sudan and Egypt, inevitably, will return to normal\r\naway from the policy of imposition of fait accompli, away\r\nfrom the policies of occupation of territory by force and\r\novert support for organized armed terrorism and away from\r\nthe legitimization of rebellion and sedition.\r\nIt is our conviction that the ties of brotherhood and\r\nsolidarity that, historically, have linked our two peoples,\r\nwill remain as strong and as enduring as the Nile that flows\r\nfrom Sudan to Egypt. Sudan has very clearly supported the\r\nintegrity of Egypt within its borders. This has been the\r\nposition of principle adopted by Sudan towards Egypt, not\r\nin words but in deeds that are recorded in the eternal annals\r\nof history as when the sons of Sudan gave their lives in\r\ndefence of Egypt.\r\nAs we are renewing the commitment to and desire for\r\npeace and coexistence, we call for the resolving by\r\nnegotiation of all boundary disputes and all problems\r\nrelating to sovereignty over territories that arise between\r\nStates. Failing this, there would be no alternative but to\r\nseek arbitration by neutral parties.\r\nThe word “Islam” is derived from the Arabic word\r\n“salam” which means “peace”. Islam is a religion based on\r\nthe principles of peace, equality and justice. I do not\r\nbelieve that Islam needs anyone to defend its record: it is\r\nhistory that bears witness to the greatness of the\r\ncivilizations it gave rise to while the present attests to its\r\ncontribution to the moral and social progress of men.\r\nGod honoured man by making him with His own hand\r\nand by ordaining that this fact should for ever be a\r\nfundamental reason for honouring man and for upholding\r\nhis rights. Thus the concept of human rights, which was\r\nrecently blazoned by some as if it were something that they\r\nhave just recently discovered, has been part of Islam’s\r\nteachings for centuries upon centuries. Islam made it part\r\nof its charter which guides the believers long before that\r\nconcept found its way into modern charters.\r\nIt is indeed regrettable that such a religion should\r\nbecome the target of a malicious onslaught that aims not\r\nonly at distorting its image, but also at trying to question\r\nits origins and roots. It is all the more disturbing that\r\ncertain major Powers and societies have found it fitting to\r\nparticipate in this onslaught, without paying heed, it\r\nwould seem, to the devastating confrontation between the\r\nWest and Islam the onslaught is trying to provoke. We\r\nparticularly urge the United Nations not to allow itself to\r\nbe dragged into such a campaign.\r\nWe were pleased by the constructive approach\r\nadopted by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in his address\r\nto this Assembly and by his call for coexistence amongst\r\ndifferent cultures so that they might complement each\r\nother in building a healthy human society.\r\nIn that connection, we also applaud the statement by\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany before this\r\nAssembly and by his rejection of any linking of Islam\r\nwith terrorism. We hope that other Western leaders will\r\nfollow suit and ensure that policies on the ground should\r\nreflect such a posture. Moreover, the need to avoid\r\nattempts at misrepresenting Islam and provoking\r\nconfrontation with it requires that such positive positions\r\nshould not be confined to leaders and Governments but\r\nshould extend also and become reflected in their societies,\r\ntheir mass media and their legal, security and\r\nadministrative systems.\r\nIn conformity with our values and beliefs, which\r\nrespect women, the State has promoted the position of\r\nwomen in Sudan, has granted them their full rights and\r\nhas enabled them to reach the highest levels in the\r\nconstitutional, legislative, and executive branches of\r\nGovernment. In today’s Sudan, women constitute\r\n50 per cent of the Government’s working force. The\r\npercentage of females in the universities and institutions\r\nof higher education is more than 60 per cent. Sudan was\r\na pioneer among the countries of the region in the area of\r\nempowering woman. Women have been appointed not\r\nonly to govern provinces, but also to hold leading posts\r\nin a number of the ministries of central Government and\r\nin the provinces.\r\nOur option in Sudan has been that economic and\r\nsocial development should be founded on our spiritual\r\nvalues, our historical background and our social traditions.\r\nSelf-reliance has been the major underpinning of this\r\nendeavour to achieve development. Although our opting\r\nfor this path has been under conditions of an inauspicious\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nworld climate, yet we have managed to provide food,\r\nclothing and various basic services for our citizens.\r\nThe participation of the Sudanese citizen in the\r\ncountry’s public affairs underscores the approach we have\r\nopted for, namely the prevalence of the spirit of\r\nconsultation — shura — so that our citizens may be able\r\nto participate actively in the decision-making organs within\r\nthe federal system. In this context, Sudan has witnessed\r\npublic elections for various legislative bodies in more than\r\n20 of its 26 provinces. Upon completion of elections in all\r\nprovinces, elections for the members of the National\r\nAssembly will be held, and eventually, the election of a\r\nPresident of the Republic will take place.\r\nAt the moment, Sudan hosts about one million\r\nrefugees, and despite its meagre resources, its Government\r\nprovides them with material assistance. It is unfortunate that\r\nthe international community has discontinued its assistance\r\nto those refugees, thus leaving the country to bear the brunt\r\nof this essentially international responsibility. We call upon\r\nthe international community to increase its financial\r\nassistance to the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to meet the essential\r\nneeds of refugee projects and programmes in Sudan. Failure\r\nby the international community to do so will be quite unfair\r\nto Sudan, as it would mean that the country is expected to\r\ncontinue to host such a number of refugees while the\r\ninternational community fails to discharge its responsibility\r\ntowards them.\r\nWe come to this session of the General Assembly\r\nmotivated by good faith, and determination to play fully our\r\nrole in cooperation with the international family of the\r\nUnited Nations. In so doing, we are inspired by our\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and by our desire to put our capabilities at\r\nthe service of the common good of mankind and to work\r\nfor the realization of our aspirations after a new world\r\norder that would be characterized by liberty, equality and\r\njustice. We hope that the principles set forth in this\r\nstatement would point the way towards the attainment of\r\nthe noble goals which the United Nations was created to\r\nachieve.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Tourism of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, His Excellency Mr. Alpian Allen.\r\nMr. Allen (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): I wish,\r\non behalf of my country, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nto congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly. He assumes the\r\npresidency on the historic occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nCommendation is in order too for His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, for the competence and\r\nsensitivity he displayed as he presided over the last\r\nsession.\r\nLet us also take this opportunity to express to the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, our profound gratitude for the efforts which he has\r\nmade so far to achieve greater flexibility, and for the\r\nenhancement of the capability of this world body to meet\r\nthe new challenges posed by the seismic upheavals taking\r\nplace in the international arena.\r\nMy delegation is supportive of United Nations\r\nreform initiatives. We must redouble our efforts to ensure\r\na more efficient United Nations system that will respond\r\neffectively to security and humanitarian needs, promote\r\nhuman rights, and build the capacity for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Central to our concerns is the importance of\r\nensuring democracy in the United Nations. If this\r\nOrganization’s moral authority is to be preserved in an\r\nincreasingly democratized world, it is inescapable that its\r\nown processes must be made more democratic. It is\r\ntherefore imperative, as we consider the enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council, that the existing geographic\r\nimbalance be noted, and that the five regions of the world\r\nbe adequately represented.\r\nMy delegation calls for a more effective and\r\nefficient United Nations. We are cognizant of the urgent\r\nneed to address the deteriorating finances of this great\r\nOrganization. Since the end of the cold war, funds for\r\ndevelopment in poorer countries have been drastically\r\nreduced, and peace-keeping demands now compete for the\r\nlimited funds available. In his recent report on the work\r\nof the Organization, the Secretary-General revealed that\r\nMember States owed the Organization approximately\r\n$3.6 billion. Let us all work together to address this issue\r\nof arrears, which seriously impairs the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe role of peace-keeping forces will have to be\r\nredefined. My delegation is concerned when lightly armed\r\npeace-keepers or unarmed aid workers on a humanitarian\r\nmission are threatened, taken hostage, harmed, or even\r\nkilled. To preserve the credibility of all United Nations\r\npeace operations, personnel must be protected as they\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\ncarry out the duties that the international community has\r\nsent them to accomplish.\r\nThe recently concluded Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, held in Beijing, has certainly served to raise the\r\nlevel of consciousness worldwide on the many problems\r\nthat women still encounter in many countries of the United\r\nNations. It is now evident that, even in those countries\r\nwhere legislation has opened the road to equality and\r\nequity, traditional attitudes continue to impede this process.\r\nI am happy to report that in Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, women have been given the opportunity to\r\nlead. Over 40 per cent of the top administrative posts in our\r\ncivil service are held by women. Women also have equal\r\naccess to the political process and enjoy equal pay for equal\r\nwork. Moreover, my Government amended the constitution\r\nto give women citizenship rights equal to those previously\r\naccorded only to men.\r\nAdherence to the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter and the right to self-determination of the world’s\r\npeoples remain among the fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter. This is reflected in the growing membership of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan, which was once a\r\nMember of this body, still finds itself on the outside,\r\nknocking persistently at the doors of our chambers. It is the\r\nview of the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nwhich we also expressed at the last session, that the time\r\nhas come for serious consideration to be given to the\r\neligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become\r\na Member of the United Nations. Our position is based on\r\nthe principle of universality and in accordance with the\r\nestablished model of parallel representation of divided\r\ncountries. We have recognized the several parts of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, and this model should continue to guide\r\nour policy.\r\nMy delegation believes that the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan is fully equipped to play an expanded role in the\r\nworld economic arena. Its successful development\r\nexperience can indeed serve as a reference for developing\r\ncountries. Not only has the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nachieved economic success but, in a few years, its political\r\nsystem has evolved from one characterized by authoritarian\r\nrule into one based on democratic principles. We cannot\r\npreach about the universality of the United Nations while\r\nat the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 21 million\r\npeople. It is more than time for the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan to be given the opportunity to make a tangible\r\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its strong commitment to\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes among States. The\r\nGulf War is now behind us, but the international\r\ncommunity must continue to recognize the potential for\r\nconflict that still exists in that part of the world.\r\nIn January 1995, the Secretary-General issued a\r\nSupplement to his “Agenda for Peace” of 1992, which\r\nhighlighted new kinds of United Nations operations to\r\ndeal with the outbreak of ethnic and religious wars within\r\nnewly independent States. It is the fervent hope of my\r\ndelegation that a lasting peace will come to the troubled\r\nregions of the world, particularly to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. One can recall when the despicable system\r\nof apartheid was demolished in South Africa, just over a\r\nyear ago. It therefore behoves us to eradicate such evil\r\nthoughts as “ethnic cleansing” from the minds of men in\r\nother parts of the world.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to applaud the efforts\r\nof the Israeli Government and the leadership of the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to pursue peace\r\ntalks despite the efforts of terrorists to derail the process.\r\nMy delegation fully supports a peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict that has plagued that region of the world for so\r\nmany years.\r\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States was of\r\ngreat importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nThe vulnerability of small island States such as ours is of\r\ngrave concern and we eagerly look forward to the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action agreed to in\r\nBarbados in 1994.\r\nLess than one month ago, the Caribbean region felt\r\nthe impact of several storms and hurricanes which\r\nseverely ravaged our sister islands of Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, Saint Maarten,\r\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In the spirit of\r\nCaribbean brotherhood, the entire rest of the region came\r\nto the support of those affected. The Prime Minister, Sir\r\nJames Mitchell, in his capacity as current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), along\r\nwith Prime Minister Compton of Saint Lucia and Prime\r\nMinister Arthur of Barbados, immediately embarked on\r\na tour of the islands which were severely hit.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nA national effort was mobilized in my own country for\r\nrelief supplies. My delegation takes this opportunity to call\r\nfor further external assistance, which remains crucial. On\r\nbehalf of the Government and people of Saint Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines, I wish to convey our profound sympathy to\r\nthe Governments and the peoples of the islands affected,\r\nparticularly to the families of those who lost their lives as\r\na result of Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn.\r\nWe also wish to express our sympathy to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica, and more specifically the families of those who\r\nlost their lives in the senseless bombing of the Federal\r\nBuilding in Oklahoma earlier this year.\r\nOur small and fragile States are now being threatened\r\nby another type of disaster — an economic disaster, with\r\nmounting pressures being exerted by very powerful forces\r\nwhich appear not to understand the importance of the\r\nbanana industry to our very survival. Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines and the other banana producing countries of the\r\nWindward Islands are limited to a mere three per cent of\r\nthe world market trade in the commodity. The powerful\r\nmultinational companies which are seeking to reverse the\r\nspecial arrangements under the Lomé Convention already\r\ncontrol over 80 per cent of the world market.\r\nMore profits for multinational companies must not be\r\nto the detriment of the small islands striving to maintain\r\ndemocracy. The destruction of the Caribbean banana\r\nindustry will create economic and social havoc nationally\r\nand regionally, and will undoubtedly have severe\r\nrepercussions at the international level. We recognize the\r\nmomentum for free trade, but see no reason why, as obtains\r\nwith issues related to other agricultural regions, of various\r\ncountries, we cannot be given the time to adjust and\r\nrestructure our economies.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has already seen its\r\nactive involvement and participation at the regional level in\r\nthe Caribbean as an indispensable dimension of its role as\r\na member of the international community. We have\r\nconsistently defined our objective to become members of\r\nour various institutional bodies as a logical and natural\r\nculmination of our international vocation. This definition is\r\nrooted in our country’s political, social and economic\r\nrealities, as they have been shaped by our historical and\r\ncultural heritage.\r\nAs a member of the recently established Association\r\nof Caribbean States (ACS), we are indeed delighted to be\r\ngiven a greater opportunity to strengthen relations with our\r\nLatin American neighbours. Comprising some 200 million\r\nethnically and culturally diverse peoples, the ACS will\r\nserve as a vehicle to promote the implementation of\r\npolicies and programmes designed to harness, utilize and\r\ndevelop the potential of the Caribbean Sea, promote and\r\nenhance economic space for trade and investment\r\nopportunities, and establish and augment, as appropriate,\r\ninstitutional structures and cooperative arrangements\r\nresponsive to the various cultural identities within the\r\nregion.\r\nMy Government totally condemns the illicit\r\nproduction, trafficking and consumption of drugs. These\r\nharbingers of violent crimes and corruption create a\r\nserious menace to the health and well-being of our\r\neconomies and our people, threaten our democratic\r\ninstitutions, and endanger national and regional security.\r\nWe are firmly convinced that only integrated\r\nregional and international efforts can effectively address\r\nthe drug problem, and accordingly stress the need for\r\nincreased local, regional and international cooperation.\r\nGreater emphasis should be placed on programmes that\r\ngenerate employment and income for persons attracted to\r\ndrug production and trafficking as a means of livelihood.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, the international\r\ncommunity, freed of the ideological and other constraints\r\nof the East-West struggle, saw new opportunities to\r\nrespond more effectively to longstanding problems that\r\nhad defied resolution because of super-Power rivalries.\r\nThere was optimistic talk of the “peace-dividend”, and the\r\nSecurity Council acted with unprecedented consensus and\r\nmomentum on many issues.\r\nAt the same time, the thawing of the cold war\r\ntriggered long-suppressed tensions and conflicts in many\r\nparts of the world. Serious global economic and social\r\nproblems, ranging from poverty, over-population, refugees\r\nand migration, to unemployment, drug-trafficking and\r\nenvironmental decline, have affected many societies on an\r\nunprecedented scale.\r\nDespite the dramatically diminished threat of a\r\nnuclear war, the world of the 1990s turns out to be a far\r\nmore unstable place than many had hoped. The reality of\r\nglobal interdependence, while promising new\r\nopportunities for cooperation and exchange, reminds us all\r\ntoo often of our shared and persistent problems. We face\r\nmore tensions in more places: increasing degradation of\r\nthe quality of human life and even more complex issues\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nof international laws and ethics, management and practical\r\ncooperation.\r\nIt is therefore clear that the United Nations system is\r\nin greater demand than ever before. As we commemorate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this great\r\nOrganization, let us work in harmony and ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations is adequately prepared to face the\r\nchallenges of an even more complex world. We must never\r\nforget that the United Nations is a reflection of the real\r\nworld. If an ugly image appears, one should not blame the\r\nmirror.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nExternal Affairs of the Republic of Mauritius, His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Mr. Ramduthsing Jaddoo.\r\nMr. Jaddoo (Mauritius): It is with much pleasure and\r\ngreat satisfaction that I join the previous speakers who have\r\nalready congratulated the President on his election to the\r\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe participation of his country, Portugal, at the United\r\nNations has always been active and constructive. My\r\ndelegation, therefore, is confident that under the President’s\r\nwise and able leadership our Organization will progress\r\nfurther towards its goals. And we assure him of our fullest\r\ncooperation and support in the tasks that devolve upon him.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to express our sincere\r\nappreciation to the President’s distinguished predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, for the\r\nadmirable and effective manner in which he conducted the\r\nbusiness of the forty-ninth session.\r\nLet me also renew my delegation’s homage to\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the efficient and committed\r\nmanner in which he is carrying out his mission as\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nEvery year, we seize the opportunity of the session of\r\nthe General Assembly to share our views and concerns\r\nabout the state of international relations. In this fiftieth year\r\nof the existence of our Organization, I particularly wish to\r\naddress the Assembly from the perspective of a small island\r\nState.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the breakup of the Soviet\r\nbloc, the globalization of the world economy and the\r\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization to oversee\r\ninternational trade, the emergence of China as an economic\r\ngiant, the liberalization of the Indian economy and South\r\nAfrica’s return to the community of nations, in such a short\r\nspan of time, have all contributed to rapid changes in the\r\nglobal economic scene.\r\nMy country shares the belief that regionalization is\r\na first prerequisite for smooth integration into a global\r\neconomic pattern. It was natural, therefore, that the region\r\nof the Indian Ocean could not remain isolated from the\r\nmovement towards regionalization, despite the fact that\r\nthe Indian Ocean countries form a heterogeneous zone\r\nwith a multiplicity of economic systems, political\r\ntraditions and cultural experiences. It is in this perspective\r\nthat Mauritius hosted, in March this year, the Indian\r\nOcean Rim (IOR) initiative. Built on the foundations of\r\nhistoric interchanges between nations in the Indian Ocean,\r\nthe IOR initiative could be seen both as a geographical\r\nreality and a natural economic entity. Its objective, as\r\nclearly outlined at the first meeting, is to establish a\r\nregional forum, tripartite in nature, that will bring together\r\nrepresentatives of Governments, business and academia\r\nfor the purpose of promoting economic cooperation in the\r\nregion. Although the IOR initiative has been launched\r\nwith an initial group, may I hasten to add that the IOR is\r\nopen to all the countries of the Indian Ocean region. As\r\nwe go along, the initiative will expand progressively to\r\ninclude other countries, on the basis of a coherent\r\nprogramme and plan of action.\r\nOther existing groupings, such as the Common\r\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) — to\r\nwhich organization my country has recently been\r\nadmitted — and the Indian Ocean Commission, have\r\nalready contributed significantly to greater interaction in\r\nour region, and it is our hope that this new initiative will\r\nfurther pave the way for a dynamic integration of the\r\nIndian Ocean region into the global economic pattern. In\r\nthis regard, we look forward to, and will highly\r\nappreciate, the support of major regional groups and\r\ncountries in the implementation of this laudable initiative.\r\nIndeed, while we are making considerable efforts to\r\nensure the prosperity and advancement of our countries,\r\nwe are also very much aware that this cannot be achieved\r\nwithout the assistance of major players in the global\r\neconomy. At the same time, it is important that, at a time\r\nof growing interdependence among States and economies,\r\nefforts must be made to include developing countries in\r\nthe international economic decision-making process so as\r\nto achieve effective management of the global economy.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions — namely, the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund —\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nshould be able to devise new ways and means of\r\nresponding to the development needs, priorities and\r\nspecificities of developing countries by providing adequate\r\nresources without stringent conditionalities. I should like\r\nhere to appeal to the international financial institutions to\r\nput aside, when circumstances demand, their first and\r\nforemost role of bankers and act more as partners in the\r\nglobal development process. For it is becoming increasingly\r\nclear that development problems cannot be solved by\r\ncountries on their own, whatever be their sense of\r\ncommitment and purpose. Africa, where countries are\r\nafflicted by deep-seated and chronic problems, is one such\r\nexample.\r\nMy country, therefore, welcomes the views expressed\r\nby the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Development,\r\nand in particular supports his démarches to alleviate\r\nproblems and sufferings on the African continent. We wish\r\nin this regard to see the rapid implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development in Africa in the\r\n1990s and the Cairo Agenda for Action on Relaunching\r\nAfrican Economic and Social Development, as well as the\r\nrecommendations of the Bandung Asia-Africa Forum.\r\nAfrica, we know, is not alone, and we were gratified in\r\nSeptember last year by President Clinton’s statement at the\r\nreception for African nations to the effect that\r\n“The United States has been, and will continue to be,\r\na partner in Africa’s success story”.\r\nThis is comforting, and we wish to see more concrete steps\r\nin this direction.\r\nI wish also to seize this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\ntwo decades of partnership between the countries of Africa,\r\nthe Caribbean and the Pacific and those of the European\r\nUnion, through the Lomé Conventions. In a few weeks’\r\ntime Mauritius will have the privilege and honour of\r\nhosting the signing of the second financial protocol of\r\nLomé IV. While I pay tribute to this concrete example of\r\neffective partnership between the North and the South, it is\r\nour sincere hope that our partners of the European Union\r\nwill continue to support its traditional friends despite\r\nemerging demands nearer home.\r\nEconomic and socio-cultural progress cannot be\r\nsustained if man does not remain at the centre of\r\ndevelopment. In this context, education, training and\r\ninformation play a fundamental role. We firmly believe that\r\nit is extremely important to invest in human resources. In\r\nkeeping with this belief, education and training are provided\r\nfree of charge at primary and secondary levels in my\r\ncountry, to boys and girls and to men and women alike.\r\nAn educated and trained individual is in a better\r\nposition to respond and adapt to the changing needs of\r\nsociety and the developments taking place around him. As\r\nsuch, he is able to provide faster and better results. One\r\nof the scourges of developing nations remains an\r\ninadequate level of education and the lack of training\r\nfacilities and access to the latest information. Developing\r\ncountries, in fact, run the risk of being left outside the\r\nnetwork of rapidly evolving information technology. And\r\nyet can anyone deny the absolute need for small island\r\nStates like mine to be connected to the rest of the world\r\nthrough up-to-date information networks? Therefore,\r\nwhile the eradication of illiteracy and the provision of\r\neducation facilities should continue to remain a top\r\npriority of the United Nations, we should add to this the\r\ntransfer of information technology.\r\nWomen are a major agent of development, and they\r\nhave often been disadvantaged in their quest for education\r\nand training. Of course, to the United Nations, the\r\nadvancement of women is not a new cause. The year\r\n1975 was proclaimed International Women’s Year,\r\nfollowed by the United Nations Decade for Women. Since\r\nthen, major United Nations conferences, such as the Earth\r\nSummit, in Rio, the World Conference on Human Rights,\r\nin Vienna, and others have repeatedly brought the plight\r\nof women to the fore, the most significant being the\r\nrecent Beijing Conference. The agreements concluded at\r\nBeijing recognized the pivotal role of women in our\r\nsociety and laid down the foundations for their\r\nparticipation as equal partners in development activities.\r\nMore important, however, will be the “after” Beijing —\r\nthe need to get down to the implementation of decisions\r\narrived at and the need to find ways and means of\r\nbuilding the bridges to allow for greater involvement of\r\nwomen in national and international matters.\r\nThe world this year befittingly witnessed two other\r\nimportant United Nations conferences: the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development in Copenhagen and the Review\r\nand Extension Conference of the States Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) in New York.\r\nThe Summit on Social Development called attention\r\nto the impact of the world economic system on the poor\r\nand underprivileged and helped to project new ideas for\r\nalternative models of social development. It also allowed\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nthe renewal of the world commitment to resolve the\r\nproblems of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.\r\nFor its part, the non-proliferation Treaty, which came\r\ninto force in 1970, is important in several ways. It\r\nenshrines an undertaking between the five nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to begin serious nuclear disarmament negotiations\r\nand the non-nuclear countries not to acquire nuclear\r\nweapons in return for access to peaceful nuclear\r\ntechnology. It is a major international agreement the aim of\r\nwhich is to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and build\r\nconfidence among the nuclear-weapon States towards a\r\nreduction of their arsenals. The Treaty also provides the\r\nbasis for legitimate trade in nuclear technology for peaceful\r\npurposes.\r\nThe indefinite extension of the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty in May this year can be considered\r\na landmark in the history of mankind, which has committed\r\nitself to free the world from the threat of nuclear weapons.\r\nUnfortunately, the optimism generated by the indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty was short-lived in the wake of the\r\nresumption of recent nuclear testings. These activities are\r\ndefinitely not encouraging signs for the conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty in the foreseeable future.\r\nIn our region, however, we are confident that the\r\nAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, which was\r\nrecently finalized in South Africa, will go a long way\r\ntowards contributing to international peace and security. It\r\ncovers a large part of the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic\r\nOcean, both containing major sea routes of the world. My\r\ndelegation sincerely hopes to see the speedy entry into force\r\nof this Treaty, which, among other issues, encompasses the\r\nintegrality of the territory of States members of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity as a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone.\r\nThe Vienna Conference was a turning-point for world\r\nperception of human rights. We hope that the principles and\r\nobjectives enshrined in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action on human rights may in time be\r\nrecognized and effectively respected in all corners of the\r\nworld. My country has always upheld human rights and\r\nfavoured their promotion and protection. But at the same\r\ntime, in the field of human rights, we believe that we have\r\nto move with caution lest we run the risk of damaging the\r\ninterests of those very individuals and societies that we are\r\npurporting to protect in the short run.\r\nNevertheless, this should not prevent us from\r\ncombining our best efforts in all good faith to bring about\r\na just and equitable society by trying to win the\r\nconfidence of the peoples, societies and Governments\r\nrather than by threatening them economically, militarily\r\nor otherwise. The upholding of human values and uplift\r\nof humanity should continue to remain our main concern\r\nat all times and in the best interests of humanity. It is for\r\nthis reason that we should seize every opportunity to\r\napplaud the restoration of human rights and democracy,\r\nregardless of other considerations. We are delighted,\r\ntherefore, at the long-awaited liberation of Mrs. Aung San\r\nSuu Kyi this year, which we feel has opened up new\r\navenues for dialogue in Myanmar.\r\nDuring the past few years in particular, the United\r\nNations has become increasingly identified in the public\r\nperception with the Blue Helmets. The growing focus on\r\nthe activities of the peace-keepers is such that their\r\nsuccesses and failures often affect the credibility of our\r\nOrganization. Peace-keeping is an important tool for\r\nconflict resolution; its success depends to a large extent\r\non a strong political will on the part of Member States, a\r\nclear mandate to the peace-keepers and solid material,\r\nlogistical and financial support. However, one of the main\r\nfactors for conflict resolution remains the early\r\nidentification of potential conflicts and tensions. While\r\narms and weapons can be used to threaten and\r\ntemporarily silence those involved in the conflicts, lasting\r\npeace can be achieved only through moral persuasion, the\r\nremoval of fear and despair, and the instilling of hope and\r\nsecurity in the minds of people. The need, therefore, to\r\nstrengthen the arms of preventive diplomacy becomes\r\nimperative.\r\nIn the recent past, the United Nations has been\r\nincreasingly called upon to carry out peace-keeping and\r\npeacemaking operations. In fact, the number of demands\r\nmade on the Organization is now straining its resources\r\nalmost to the breaking-point. The erratic and reluctant\r\ndisbursement of contributions by some Member States has\r\nhighlighted the shortcomings of such operations and\r\nexposed the limits of this approach in ensuring peace and\r\nstability. We therefore need more than ever to place much\r\ngreater emphasis on preventive diplomacy and allocate\r\nmore resources to this activity. We believe that, in the\r\nlong run, the cost of supporting programmes in\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\npreventive diplomacy would be far outweighed by the\r\nactual costs of dispatching Blue Helmets around the world.\r\nIn this respect, we urge the international community\r\nstrongly to support regional initiatives, such as the\r\nmechanism for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The\r\nexperience of my country as a result of my own personal\r\nparticipation in several ministerial missions organized by\r\nthe OAU in the context of this mechanism has convinced\r\nus to put greater reliance in this approach. My delegation\r\nwould therefore like to appeal to this body to make a strong\r\ncommitment to the realization of this very important\r\nprogramme.\r\nThe establishment of an early-warning system and\r\nthreat-assessment unit at the United Nations could equally\r\nsupport the proposed OAU early-warning system. This\r\nwould go a long way towards preparing the United Nations\r\nto deal with the contemporary challenges of peace-keeping\r\nand peace-building at a more realistic cost. Yet I would\r\nappeal for more cohesion and harmonization among the\r\nvarious conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution\r\nmechanisms in order to avoid duplication of efforts.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAt this point, my delegation should like to refer to the\r\nincreasing activities of the francophone movement in the\r\nareas of conflict prevention and peace-keeping. We\r\nwelcome the encouraging results of the work of the recent\r\nconference of French-speaking countries on conflict\r\nprevention, which took place in Canada. Among the\r\nrecommendations of that conference, we note in particular\r\nthe one relating to the support of the francophone\r\nmovement for the pan-African mechanism for conflict\r\nprevention, management and resolution.\r\nIt is true that the movement has no great means at its\r\ndisposal, but it has none the less been able to lend\r\nconsiderable support in the recent past to certain United\r\nNations programme in the area of human rights and the\r\nprocess of democratization. With respect to those two areas,\r\nI also wish to highlight the important activities of the\r\nmovement over the past two years in the countries of the\r\nAfrican Great Lakes region following the tragic events that\r\ntook place there.\r\nIn December, at Cotonou, my Prime Minister will be\r\npassing on the presidency of the movement to the President\r\nof Benin. I wish to take this opportunity to express my\r\ngreat satisfaction at the way in which, during his term of\r\noffice, the political dimension of the French-speaking\r\nmovement’s work on the international level has\r\ndeveloped. I should like to express the hope that this\r\npolitical facet of the movement will in future be able to\r\nplay a growing role in international forums in striving for\r\nthe realization of lasting peace in the world.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe are already witnessing promising developments\r\nin conflict resolution in regions such as Angola,\r\nMozambique and the Middle East. We commend the\r\nrecent initiatives in Bosnia and exhort all parties\r\nconcerned to continue to intensify their efforts to find a\r\nlong-term solution, and hope that the long-awaited peace\r\nin this region is achieved not under the threat of guns, but\r\nthrough the goodwill, understanding and tolerance of all\r\nconcerned.\r\nMy delegation recognizes that the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations provides a golden opportunity for\r\nthe re-examination and the renewal of the United Nations\r\nsystem, and welcomes the initiative launched in the\r\nGeneral Assembly to negotiate a reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We believe that the present 15-member\r\ncomposition of the Security Council does not reflect the\r\nrealities of the economic and political changes of the past\r\ndecades. In its present composition, the Security Council\r\ncan neither claim to take into account the positions of\r\nnations in the next 50 years, nor reasonably pretend to\r\nspeak on behalf of 185 nations for the maintenance of\r\nworld peace and security. The Security Council has\r\nindeed the main task of maintaining peace and security.\r\nHowever, the concept of world security has itself\r\nundergone a huge transformation. We are now more at\r\nrisk from the threat of economic, social, cultural and\r\nreligious upheavals and turmoils than from the outbreak\r\nof war resulting from conflicts between States or a group\r\nof States. Consequently, if the Security Council is to\r\ncommand full respect in all parts of the world and enjoy\r\nlegitimacy, it should undergo a complete overhaul.\r\nIn the context of the current exercise on the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council, we believe that the\r\nclaim of India, the largest parliamentary democracy, to a\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council is legitimate. In\r\nthe same spirit, countries from other regions, including\r\nsmall island States, could equally aspire to permanent\r\nseats in an expanded Security Council.\r\nThe world has gradually been reduced to a global\r\nvillage. The regions of the world and their peoples,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nalthough still widely separated geographically, are fast\r\nrealizing that the future of the world community lies in a\r\ncommon shared goal. We are increasingly becoming aware\r\nthat the world is one family, and that if we are to assure a\r\nbrighter and better future for coming generations, we have\r\nno other choice than to continue our efforts towards\r\npreserving and promoting a strong United Nations that will\r\nbe able to pursue a common purpose for a world of equity,\r\njustice and shared economic progress.\r\nIn Mauritius, in spite of the existence of many cultures\r\nand religions, we have been successful in promoting\r\npeaceful coexistence. We have always believed that no\r\nmeaningful progress can be achieved in the absence of\r\npeace and harmony. We have always believed in our people\r\nand have actively promoted the culture of tolerance and\r\nmutual respect. We remain deeply committed to the\r\nprinciples of democracy and justice. The path of tolerance\r\nand mutual respect for different faiths and religions and the\r\nacceptance of unity in diversity laid down under the\r\ninspiring leadership of the Father of the Nation, Sir\r\nSeewoosagur Ramgoolam, since independence in 1968 and\r\nfollowed through relentlessly by our present Prime Minister,\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth have been largely responsible for the\r\nharmonious way of life in Mauritius.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like on the occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization to share with the\r\ninternational community our rich experience of living in\r\npeace and harmony.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Chairman of\r\nthe delegation of Tajikistan, His Excellency Mr. Rashid\r\nAlimov.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nFirst of all, let me express to His Excellency Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral my sincere congratulations on his\r\nelection to the responsible post of President of the General\r\nAssembly. There can be no doubt that his rich experience,\r\nboth in life and in diplomacy, will serve to enhance the\r\nproductive work of our anniversary session.\r\nMr. Traoré (Mali), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nFive decades ago, having achieved victory over the\r\nforces of evil in the Second World War, the international\r\ncommunity evinced the wisdom and political will to build\r\ntogether the universal home of peace and common security:\r\nthe United Nations. And perhaps the main result of the past\r\nfew decades has been that, with the help of the United\r\nNations, we managed to save the world from another\r\nworld war. All of us can be proud of that.\r\nAlthough the “big” war spared us, this in no way\r\ndiminished the increasing danger of small wars in the\r\nworld, which have caused intense suffering and misery.\r\nEconomic and social development in the countries where\r\nthese wars take place is set back for decades. And\r\nalthough the civil war in Tajikistan is now behind us, it\r\nis still necessary to pursue the final settlement of the civil\r\nconflict.\r\nIt was the dialogue initiated by the Government of\r\nTajikistan, rather than violent confrontation, that began to\r\nyield tangible results. A significant role here was played\r\nby international interaction and by joint efforts on the\r\nregional level.\r\nA perceptible acceleration in the process of dialogue\r\nresulted from the meetings between the President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, Mr. Imomali Rakhmonov, and the\r\nleadership of the armed opposition in Kabul and Tehran.\r\nThis incontestably demonstrated our good will and our\r\nsincere aspiration for the early achievement of complete\r\nstability and accord on Tajik soil.\r\nWe are sincerely grateful to the leaders of the\r\nIslamic State of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran for their personal contribution in arranging the\r\nmeetings between the President of Tajikistan,\r\nMr. Rakhmonov, and the leader of the opposition,\r\nMr. Nuri. The efforts of these and other countries acting\r\nas observers in the inter-Tajik negotiations tangibly\r\nsupplemented the mediating activity of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, his Special\r\nEnvoy, Ambassador Píriz Ballón, and also the regional\r\nand intergovernmental organizations that acted as\r\nobservers at the inter-Tajik negotiations for their\r\nsubstantial contribution to the resolution of the conflict.\r\nThe results of these multilateral efforts have already\r\nbecome apparent. Signed by the sides in the middle of\r\nAugust this year, the Protocol on the fundamental\r\nprinciples for establishing peace and national accord in\r\nTajikistan, which contains, inter alia, the decision to\r\nextend the term of cease-fire agreement until\r\n26 February 1996, has created a solid basis for the\r\nattainment of general agreement for peace and national\r\naccord in Tajikistan.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nThe Government of Tajikistan is in favour of the\r\nearliest possible start to an ongoing round of negotiations\r\nwith the Opposition. We plan to begin this very soon. The\r\nintention is that in the course of the forthcoming dialogue\r\nthe Government and its opponents will agree upon a\r\ncomplete set of issues for a comprehensive peace\r\nsettlement. A prerequisite for that is that the Opposition\r\nagree to act with the Government on a common legal basis.\r\nWhat is important is that, having signed the protocol to\r\nwhich I have referred, the Opposition undertook to conduct\r\nits political struggle exclusively by peaceful means and in\r\naccordance with current legislation in the Republic of\r\nTajikistan.\r\nWe cannot ignore the fact that there are difficulties in\r\nthis process. Among the representatives of the hard-line\r\nwing of the Opposition there are forces whose attitude\r\nfavours terrorism and political and religious extremism. To\r\nachieve their own narrow, selfish ends they are inclined to\r\nstick to the policy of keeping strong pressure on the\r\nGovernment. Their arsenal includes terrorist acts,\r\nintimidation of people inside the country, constant violation\r\nof the Tajik-Afghan border, which is protected by border\r\nguards of Russia, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan,\r\nas well as by our own soldiers.\r\nThe continuous interference from outside in the\r\ninter-Tajik conflict has had a negative impact on the\r\nsettlement process. Evidence of that is the continuing\r\nexplosive situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, which tends\r\nto destabilize the situation in Tajikistan as well as in all of\r\nCentral Asia.\r\nThe unstable situation makes it possible for criminal\r\nelements to engage in the illegal supply of drugs and arms\r\non a large scale across the southern border of Tajikistan.\r\nThe consequences of these criminal acts have a negative\r\nimpact, not just in our country or in the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS), but also far beyond the borders\r\nof the CIS.\r\nIn this connection, it is appropriate to recall that the\r\nleadership of Tajikistan and the States whose military\r\ncontingents comprise the peace-keeping forces of the CIS\r\nhave repeatedly requested that these forces be given the\r\nstatus of a United Nations operation. An important reason\r\nfor that is the accumulated experience of close and\r\nconstructive collaboration between the United Nations\r\nMission of Observers in Tajikistan and the collective peace-\r\nkeeping forces of the CIS, as well as the border-guard\r\nforces in Tajikistan. This collaboration is already one of the\r\nmost important factors in stabilizing the situation.\r\nThe completed process of constitutional reforms and\r\nthe concomitant peaceful transformation in State power\r\nhave also contributed to the inter-Tajik settlement.\r\nIndependent Tajikistan has now acquired a Constitution;\r\nthe President of the country, who is its guarantor, came\r\nto office as the result of popular elections; legislative\r\npower is vested in a newly elected Parliament, the Majlisi\r\nOli; all branches of power at the centre, as well as\r\nlocally, have been strengthened and are working\r\neffectively; and the principle of the primacy of the law\r\nhas made active headway in the country.\r\nIt is not sufficient simply to note that all these\r\nprocesses took place in the period between the forty-ninth\r\nsession and the fiftieth anniversary session of the General\r\nAssembly: it is fair to note also that much was achieved\r\nwith the assistance of the United Nations institutions and\r\nspecialized agencies.\r\nWhile there may have been significant progress in\r\nthe political process, it has proved quite difficult to\r\nimprove the situation in the national economy in the\r\nperiod of transition without any support from outside,\r\ndespite the concrete steps that are being taken towards\r\nmarket reforms. A national currency has been introduced,\r\nprices have been liberalized, the process of accelerated\r\nprivatization is under way, and so on.\r\nIn other words, the conditions have been created for\r\nthe development of the economy in the transition period.\r\nAt the same time, restoring those aspects of daily life that\r\nwere destroyed by the civil war of 1992 has been\r\nextremely difficult. Our health care, education and social\r\nsecurity are in critical condition.\r\nThe question of the return and settlement of refugees\r\nand displaced persons and their social rehabilitation\r\nremains crucial. We are grateful for the efforts of\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations for their generosity to our\r\ncountry in helping to resolve the refugee problem.\r\nAs is known, Tajikistan does not have access to the\r\nsea. However, it possesses significant quantities of natural\r\nresources, and it has substantial industrial potential. If our\r\ncountry were to be approached by international financial\r\norganizations this would significantly ease the situation\r\nand accelerate the process of reform in the economy.\r\nWe call upon the States Members of the United\r\nNations to cooperate in mutually beneficial partnership.\r\nStabilization in the economy of Tajikistan will not only\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nserve to satisfy the socio-economic needs of our people; it\r\nwill become an important factor for further development of\r\ndemocratic institutions in our country, strengthening the\r\nmachinery for the defence of human rights and the process\r\nof national accord and the consolidation of society.\r\nAs an equal member of the world community, the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, to the extent of its potential, will\r\nstrive to participate actively in international political life.\r\nTajikistan actively supports the strengthening of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to\r\nwhich it is a party, as well as a comprehensive nuclear-test\r\nban.\r\nMy country attaches great importance to the\r\ndevelopment of broad cooperation, not only with the United\r\nNations but also with regional organizations. The Republic\r\nof Tajikistan is a striking example of successful practical\r\ninteraction between two influential international\r\norganizations — the United Nations and the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — in their\r\ncommon interests. The ties between Tajikistan and the\r\nOSCE are developing in all major areas of that\r\norganization’s activity. We also attach great importance to\r\nthe activity of Tajikistan within the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nOur country pays particular attention to the state of\r\naffairs in the Commonwealth of Independent States and to\r\nthe consistent development of that organization’s ties with\r\neach of its members.\r\nThe development of the situation in the central Asian\r\nregion is of vital importance to our Republic. The\r\nGovernment of my country is a staunch advocate of the\r\nparity approach to the settlement of regional political\r\nproblems and of the closest possible economic integration\r\nof the States in its region.\r\nFinally, I should like to say a few words about the\r\nsituation in a neighbouring country — Afghanistan, which\r\nis one of the most dreadful casualties in the aftermath of\r\nthe cold war. There appears to be no end to the internecine\r\nconflict in the territory of this long-suffering nation. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations and the world community\r\nhave sufficient political and moral weight to exert a\r\nmeaningful influence on the parties to this fratricidal\r\nconflict with a view to ending the bloodshed as soon as\r\npossible. This would undoubtedly be one of the most\r\nsignificant contributions by the United Nations to the\r\nestablishment of universal peace and security.\r\nThe 50-year history of the United Nations has\r\nenriched us with the invaluable capacity to live in peace\r\nwith each other despite our differences. Applying this\r\nexperience, we must give our peoples high hopes for life\r\nin the third millennium. In this sense, we share very much\r\nthe concept of the Secretary-General’s report “An Agenda\r\nfor Development”. Consonant with this are the joint\r\ninitiatives of the CIS States at the fiftieth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly — initiatives in which\r\nTajikistan has participated. The most relevant of these is\r\nthe convening of an international conference on refugees\r\nand migrants in post-Soviet territory.\r\nThe package of documented initiatives from the CIS\r\nStates confirms our will to further integrate the\r\nCommonwealth into the international community, and to\r\nseek more active participation in the work of United\r\nNations institutions and its specialized agencies. Our joint\r\nefforts do not mean that we wish to work in isolation.\r\nThey simply testify to the fact that there is a great deal\r\nthat unites us, and there is much we share in common\r\nwith respect to our development besides having many\r\nsimilar problems.\r\nThe entire civilized world, with great concern and\r\nindeed with growing alarm about what will happen to\r\nfuture generations, has been observing increasing\r\nincidents of international terrorism, religious fanaticism\r\nand ultra-nationalism. The task of the world community\r\nis to unite efforts to counteract the forces of evil. The\r\ntragic events in Tokyo, Oklahoma and Budenovsk show\r\nthat the world must intensify the struggle in those\r\ndirections, including foiling the attempts of terrorists to\r\nget access to weapons of mass destruction, whether they\r\nbe nuclear, chemical or any other kind.\r\nInternational terrorism, drug trafficking and the illicit\r\ntraffic in weapons, the emergence of “hot spots” here and\r\nthere on the planet: these are all interconnected\r\nphenomena. The pain and suffering of the people in these\r\n“hot spots” call for urgent and joint steps to be taken to\r\nwage uncompromising war against these demons of the\r\nend of the twentieth century.\r\nAs the situation now stands, either the principles of\r\nhigh morality and humanity will prevail or the world will\r\nbe doomed to further suffering. We have no right to allow\r\nsociety to return to the epoch of barbarism.\r\nOn the eve of the end of the Second World War the\r\nfounders of the United Nations dreamed about ruling out\r\nany global catastrophes in the future. The 50 years of our\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nOrganization’s history provide convincing evidence of the\r\nconstant antagonism between the forces of reason and light\r\nand those of injustice and hatred. Today we bow our heads\r\nin respect before the tens of millions of people who\r\nsacrificed their lives for the sake of peace and justice.\r\nOver the 50 years of its existence the United Nations\r\nhas essentially saved the world from new universal\r\nslaughter. Our common task is now to step into the twenty-\r\nfirst century having learned wisdom from the experience of\r\nthe past, and having provided our children and\r\ngrandchildren with durable peace, the right to free\r\ndevelopment and spiritual progress.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Equatorial Guinea, His Excellency Don\r\nMiguel Oyono Ndong Mifumu.\r\nMr. Oyono Ndong Mifumu (Equatorial Guinea)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): I take great pleasure today in\r\naddressing this distinguished world audience on behalf of\r\nthe delegation of Equatorial Guinea in the context of the\r\nfiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I\r\nwish first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Freitas\r\ndo Amaral of Portugal on his election to preside over our\r\nwork. I wish him every success in the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. He can always rely\r\non the cooperation and solidarity of my delegation.\r\nThis fiftieth session of the Assembly is taking place at\r\na time when we are seeing a radical change of course — a\r\nneeded one, in our opinion — in the life of the United\r\nNations in today’s world.\r\nIn its first half-century, as a speaker has already said\r\nin this Hall, the United Nations has been a child of its time,\r\nthe time of the aftermath of the Second World War. It\r\ncame into being to work for peace, world security and\r\ndevelopment. Now we must determine whether these\r\nobjectives have been achieved. Peace meant avoiding war\r\nand military conflict. Global security meant preventing the\r\nescalation of conflicts. Development meant mobilizing the\r\nfinancial resources required for the reconstruction of the\r\nworld and to redress its underdevelopment.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations we are bound to acknowledge that although the\r\nOrganization has achieved certain successes in the area of\r\npreventing disputes among nations and has taken measures\r\nand initiatives to promote the resolution of certain conflicts,\r\npeace, security and development are not yet permanent\r\nfeatures of daily life in our earthly home.\r\nThe fall of the East-West ideological barriers\r\nartificially imposed by the cold war aroused expectations\r\nof an age of peace in the world. The spread of democracy\r\nand the new world-wide awareness of the importance of\r\nrespect for human rights further heightened these\r\nexpectations at the beginning of this decade.\r\nIn this context my country, the Republic of\r\nEquatorial Guinea, has striven to achieve these objectives\r\nof peace, security and development.\r\nFollowing the ousting of the dictatorship and the\r\none-party system, our Government, as early as 1979,\r\nadopted a consistent and comprehensive strategy which\r\nwas a reflection of a national consensus in favour of a\r\nmodel of society for the future of our nation that would\r\nbe based on peace, democracy and development. In this\r\ncontext we have undertaken a series of political reforms\r\nfully supported by all forces and currents of opinion in\r\nour society.\r\nSince 1992 the Government, following the lead of\r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President\r\nof the Republic and Head of State of Equatorial Guinea,\r\nhas been responsive to the people’s aspirations to\r\nfreedom, democracy and participation in the management\r\nof public affairs. With a population of only 420,000 the\r\ncountry has 14 legal political movements. This\r\nprogramme was established and has been satisfactorily\r\nimplemented since 1993, with municipal elections having\r\nbeen held on 17 September 1995. The Constitution and\r\nthe electoral timetable that has been established provide\r\nfor the holding of presidential elections in the coming\r\nyear, 1996.\r\nHowever, despite these endeavours and despite my\r\nGovernment’s resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for\r\nour people on a firm foundation, foreign interests, for\r\ntheir own unavowed purposes, want to see the democratic\r\nprocess in my country shaped as the saying is “in the\r\nimage and likeness” of those alien interests.\r\nSince the beginning of the political transition the\r\ntreatment meted out to Equatorial Guinea by certain\r\nStates Members of the Organization has been utterly\r\ndifferent from that granted to other countries in Central\r\nAfrica and in the rest of the continent, whose political\r\nevolution has been similar to our own, involving in some\r\ncases tragic consequences; that leads us to suspect that the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\ndisinformation and defamation campaign waged\r\ninternationally against the Government of Equatorial Guinea\r\nis the manifestation of hegemonistic ambitions and struggles\r\nfor influence that threaten not only the peace and social\r\nharmony that prevail in the country but also its territorial\r\nintegrity.\r\nWe do not understand how Equatorial Guinea’s\r\ndemocratization process differs from what is going on in\r\nother countries in our area. We have said yes to pluralism,\r\ndemocracy and participation. We have said yes to human\r\nrights, and we practise respect for human rights. We do not\r\nunderstand why different types of measures are applied to\r\nmy country. We regret that instead of receiving moral\r\nsupport and solidarity to help us consolidate our\r\nachievements, we are subjected to economic blockades and\r\nthe unilateral suspension of cooperative programmes agreed\r\nby convention. Instead of receiving understanding for what\r\ncould be the result of deficiencies of structure or of\r\ndemocratic culture in the society of Equatorial Guinea as a\r\nwhole, we are subjected to reproach, intimidation, threats\r\nand a humiliating and intolerable interference in our\r\ncountry’s internal affairs.\r\nWe do not believe that a tragic breakdown of social\r\nand economic structures, such as has taken place in the\r\nbrotherly countries of Liberia, Rwanda, Angola, Somalia\r\nand other countries and regions of the African continent,\r\nrepresents the best form of cooperation with and assistance\r\nto African peoples.\r\nI wish to declare before this forum of the international\r\ncommunity that outside influences are engineering and\r\ninstigating an internal conflict in my country that would\r\nhave unforeseeable consequences.\r\nIndeed, some political circles and communications\r\nmedia are waging a campaign from Spain, the old colonial\r\nPower, to intensify the differences between the people of\r\nEquatorial Guinea, supporting some and harassing others,\r\nthus provoking divisions and antagonisms. Even graver is\r\nthe support offered to the Self-determination Movement of\r\nthe Island of Bioko, a secessionist group. In addition, a\r\nstation of Radio Exterior de España has been created and\r\naimed expressly at Equatorial Guinea to carry out a\r\npoisonous disinformation campaign deliberately intended to\r\ndistort the socio-political reality of the country. The\r\nbroadcasts of Radio Exterior de España are the most\r\ndisruptive element in the country’s democratization process\r\nand constitute a Petri dish that spawns acts of violence and\r\nthe destabilization of Equatorial Guinea’s social structures.\r\nWe wish to apprise the international community of\r\nthis matter, and we ask it to request the Spanish\r\nGovernment to put an end to this aggression perpetrated\r\nfrom its territory by the public entity Radio Exterior de\r\nEspaña and by certain political circles. Under the pretext\r\nof supporting the democratic process under way in our\r\ncountry, those political circles, consisting of\r\nParliamentarians, party and labour leaders, associations\r\nand pressure groups, clandestinely support, coordinate and\r\nfinance secessionist movements and political parties\r\nstanding in radical opposition to the legitimate\r\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea. This overt interference\r\nis intended to bring about violent political changes in my\r\ncountry.\r\nClear evidence of this interference can be seen in the\r\ncurrent disinformation and discreditation campaign being\r\nwaged from Spain by those political circles and\r\ncommunications media following the municipal elections\r\nheld in my country on 17 September last. Those circles\r\nplanned and illegally financed the electoral campaign of\r\nthe radical opposition, banded together in the Joint\r\nOpposition Platform (POC). They have created confusion\r\nby trying to manipulate the electoral results.\r\nThose same Spanish political circles are today trying\r\nto manipulate international public opinion by falsely\r\naccusing the Government of electoral fraud and violations\r\nof human rights. The recent report of the United Nations\r\nSpecial Rapporteur, Mr. Alejandro Artucio, suffices to\r\ngive the lie to these accusations. My Government\r\ncomplies with the programme and recommendations of\r\nthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights.\r\nOne cannot credibly claim to be supporting political\r\nreform in my country by stirring up antagonism and\r\ndisputes between the political sectors of my country. One\r\ncannot credibly claim to be helping the people of\r\nEquatorial Guinea by suspending cooperation in the\r\neducational, health and agricultural sectors. One cannot\r\ncredibly claim to be helping the people of Equatorial\r\nGuinea by inciting the donor community to block projects\r\nof proven social effectiveness. We sincerely believe that\r\none cannot help any people by depriving it of the\r\nresources and opportunities to improve its living\r\nconditions.\r\nMy country lives in peace and order. We just need\r\na friendly, sincere and respectful helping hand. We are\r\ntold that there can be no development without democracy,\r\nand we agree. But our experience, which we believe has\r\nbeen shared by other developing countries, is that\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\ndemocracy amid poverty and underdevelopment is a pipe\r\ndream. Poverty and underdevelopment breed violence and\r\nsocial and political instability.\r\nWe therefore sincerely seek international relations\r\ncharacterized by mutual support and solidarity, not partisan\r\npressure, in order to consolidate this climate that makes\r\ndemocracy and the development of our peoples possible.\r\nMy second request, in accordance with what the\r\ndeveloping countries have been asking for for over a\r\ndecade, is that the current unfair international economic\r\nsystem be replaced. Nevertheless, all these global\r\nagreements — such as those of the recent World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, held in Beijing, and the latest\r\nagreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n(GATT) — have served only to bring us to today’s sad\r\nimpasse, which reveals the radical and irreconcilable\r\nattitudes of both sides. The so-called developed countries of\r\nthe North and the developing countries of the South,\r\ndivided by selfishness, ambition and intolerance, deprive\r\nfuture generations of a better world.\r\nA few days before celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof our Organization, there still persists in the United\r\nNations the spirit of a bipolar world dominated by\r\nsuspicions on both sides, mistrust, discrimination, attitudes\r\nof superiority, a lack of political will to develop frank and\r\nsincere cooperation and a desire for hegemony in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe response of the United Nations to the questions\r\nasked by those who spoke before me and to the challenges\r\nof the new changes on the international stage must contain\r\ntwo indispensable elements. The first is that the United\r\nNations should represent the interests of everyone, by\r\nintroducing certain structural reforms making it possible to\r\nattain the objectives for which it was created. Secondly, we\r\nmust provide the United Nations with a deeper-going\r\ncapacity for genuine dialogue between the nations that\r\nmake it up and speak to the world in a language of\r\nunderstanding.\r\nThe necessary dialogue must be global and must\r\nencompass all aspects of international relations, be they\r\neconomic, political or cultural. It is impractical to limit\r\ndialogue between nations, regardless of their size and\r\npower, since all the countries of the world must take an\r\nactive part in the dialogue process in order to arrive\r\ntogether at a common and secure destiny, abandoning no\r\none to the abyss of underdevelopment and abject poverty.\r\nThis is the challenge of the next 50 years for our\r\nOrganization. May God bless the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBhutan, His Excellency Mr. Dawa Tsering, on whom I\r\nnow call.\r\nMr. Tsering (Bhutan): I have the honour to convey\r\nto the President of the General Assembly, and through\r\nhim to all representatives, the warm greetings and good\r\nwishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of\r\nBhutan, for the success of the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I offer Mr. Freitas do Amaral the\r\nfelicitations of my delegation on his election as President\r\nof this historic session. His election to this high office is\r\na tribute to him personally and to his country, Portugal,\r\nwhich has always played an active role in the United\r\nNations. My delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire for his\r\nskilful stewardship at the forty-ninth session. His\r\npresidency has enhanced the esteem of the international\r\ncommunity for him and for Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to welcome the\r\nRepublic of Palau into our family of nations. Its\r\nparticipation will greatly enrich our Organization.\r\nThis session is of especial significance for all of us\r\nas we celebrate the passing of 50 years since the birth of\r\nthe United Nations. It is heartening to note that the grand\r\nand lofty vision which inspired our founding fathers still\r\ncontinues to inspire and guide us. More than ever before,\r\nwe see today the evidence of the collective human will to\r\nunite against threats and obstacles to the survival and\r\ncontinued progress of mankind. The participation of no\r\nfewer than 150 Heads of State or Government in the\r\nspecial commemorative meeting later this month is\r\nglowing testimony to our abiding faith in this world body.\r\nThe Intergovernmental High-level Meeting on the\r\nMid-term Global Review of the Implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\r\nfor the 1990s was held in New York recently. The least\r\ndeveloped countries as a group have not been able to\r\nmeet many of the objectives of the Programme of Action\r\nand their overall socio-economic situation has continued\r\nto deteriorate. Some of the factors responsible for this\r\ndeterioration are, internally, civil strife and natural\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\ndisasters with their resulting consequences and, externally,\r\nthe debt problem, low levels of export and an inadequate\r\nflow of external finance. These countries have, however,\r\ncontinued to implement wide-ranging reforms and in some\r\ncountries these efforts have shown positive results. A\r\nnumber of development partners have provided increased\r\nsupport to the least-developed countries, for which we are\r\ntruly grateful. We believe that the least developed countries\r\nhave the primary responsibility for their own development,\r\nand with the support of the international community they\r\nhope to alleviate the desperate plight of their peoples. The\r\nLeast Developed Countries Division of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development deserves praise for\r\nthe excellent documentation it provided for the recent\r\nintergovernmental meeting on the least developed countries.\r\nEarlier this year, we supported the indefinite extension\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). This was followed shortly thereafter by several\r\nnuclear tests — in what we believe is a contravention of\r\nthe spirit of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of\r\nthe NPT. We are increasingly concerned about the fate of\r\nthe comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and our ultimate\r\ngoal of eliminating all nuclear and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nThe maintenance of global peace and security still\r\nremains the most pressing challenge for the United Nations.\r\nIt has become the yardstick by which the United Nations is\r\ntoday being judged. Increasingly, concerns are expressed as\r\nto whether the United Nations is able to carry out this task.\r\nThe tragic situations in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand Rwanda demonstrate the inability of the international\r\ncommunity to put an end to the immeasurable suffering of\r\nthe innocent victims. Such cases raise an important issue.\r\nThe number of peace-keeping missions has grown\r\nexponentially. The past year has seen 18 peace-keeping\r\nmissions involving 78,000 peace-keepers. The good news\r\nis that the United Nations has a vital, ever-growing role to\r\nplay in keeping the peace and allowing combatants a\r\nbreathing period in which to come to the negotiating table.\r\nThe down side is that the peace-keeping missions are a\r\nconsiderable drain on the finances of the United Nations.\r\nExpenditures for peace-keeping operation are now more\r\nthan three times the entire budget for development. Surely\r\ndevelopment merits high priority as well.\r\nThe most serious obstacles to sustainable global\r\ndevelopment are the fast pace of population growth and the\r\nincreasing degradation of the environment. The situation is\r\nworst in the countries that are least able to bear the burden\r\nand where there is already an appalling disequilibrium\r\nbetween people and resources. The more advanced\r\ncountries may delay their confrontation with the\r\nenvironmental crisis but unless these issues are addressed\r\ntoday, we may see the collapse of vital resources and\r\nclimatic changes in many parts of the world and new\r\nsecurity threats resulting from poverty and chaos. This is\r\naggravated by the fact that the most significant\r\ndevelopments in the world economy are taking place\r\noutside the United Nations, and our Organization is being\r\nincreasingly marginalized on economic, financial and\r\ntrade issues.\r\nIt is important that the world continue to keep\r\ninvesting in people, especially women and children, and\r\nthat it meet their basic needs in education, health and\r\nsocial welfare. The historic United Nations conferences of\r\nthis decade on children, environment, human rights,\r\npopulation, social development and women embody the\r\nirreversible commitment of the international community\r\nto chart a new course for the future. My country is firmly\r\ncommitted to the goals set by these conferences.\r\nI wish to acknowledge the special contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations to the development of my country. The\r\nUnited Nations has been actively involved in every sphere\r\nof development in Bhutan, and has been responsible for\r\nhelping us set out on the right path of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Every effort has been made on our part to\r\nensure that all assistance received has been properly\r\nutilized and meaningful results achieved. I express the\r\nprofound gratitude of the people of Bhutan to the donor\r\ncommunity, which supports the United Nations\r\ndevelopment activities. We have particularly benefited\r\nfrom the activities of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the\r\nWorld Food Programme, the United Nations Population\r\nFund, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the\r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the\r\nUnited Nations Volunteer Programme, the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World\r\nHealth Organization, the International Monetary Fund and\r\nthe World Bank. They have contributed much to the\r\nwelfare of our people. We are also grateful to our\r\nbilateral donors, particularly India, Switzerland, Japan,\r\nDenmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Kuwait,\r\nGermany, Australia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom\r\nfor their cooperation and support.\r\nThe Working Group on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations System will once again look at\r\nstreamlining the Organization. Reform of several aspects\r\nof the United Nations system is vital, especially as we\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nconfront the many challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThere must be better distribution of power within the\r\nUnited Nations. The crippling financial situation caused by\r\nlarge arrears by Member States must be overcome. It is\r\nalso time to examine the new mechanisms for meeting the\r\nfinancial requirements of the United Nations. My delegation\r\nfeels that a proper study should be made and reported to\r\nthe Assembly at an early date. In our view, the innovative\r\nidea of a small levy on international air travel proposed by\r\nthe Foreign Minister of Australia, Senator Gareth Evans, is\r\nsound and practical.\r\nWe are of the considered view that the Security\r\nCouncil must be expanded to give greater representation to\r\ndeveloping countries in order to uphold the principles of\r\nequity and justice. Many least-developed countries like\r\nBhutan feel they are being increasingly marginalized by the\r\nnew agendas and priorities of the United Nations. In our\r\nview, the United Nations must represent the interests of all\r\ncountries equally, and not only those of a privileged few.\r\nWe therefore support the expansion of the Security Council\r\nto facilitate more equitable representation of developing\r\ncountries and deserving candidates that have emerged since\r\nthe United Nations was established 50 years ago. As a\r\nfellow South Asian nation, and as a member of the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation, of which India\r\nis by far the largest member, we strongly support India’s\r\ninclusion in the permanent-member category of the Security\r\nCouncil. India’s candidature merits serious consideration on\r\nthe grounds of equitable geographic representation, the\r\nlarge size and enormous potential of the Indian economy\r\nand the fact that one sixth of mankind lives in India.\r\nBefore I conclude, I should like to join preceding\r\nspeakers in paying tribute to the many organizations and\r\nindividuals that serve with unfailing dedication and\r\ncommitment to further the principles and purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations. I should like to pay a special tribute to\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations; to the late James Grant, former Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),\r\nwho did so much for the world’s children; to the many\r\nBlue Helmets who have sacrificed their lives so that others\r\nmay live in peace and security; and to the host of United\r\nNations personnel and volunteers who have selflessly\r\ndedicated their lives to the service of others, sometimes\r\nserving under the most trying conditions.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second, and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Whannou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nI am grateful for this opportunity to make a statement in\r\nexercise of my delegations right of reply, following the\r\nstatement made this morning by the head of the\r\ndelegation of Guinea-Bissau about the formal\r\nendorsement by the Group of African States of his\r\ncountry’s candidature for one of the non-permanent seats\r\nin the Security Council, which is to be filled in elections\r\nat this session of the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation, out of courtesy, refrained in the\r\ngeneral debate from addressing the question of West\r\nAfrican candidatures for one of the non-permanent seats\r\non the Security Council. However, we must make the\r\nsituation clear now by emphasizing that the African\r\nGroup has also formally recorded the candidature of\r\nBenin for that West African seat.\r\nBenin’s candidature dates back to 1991, when Benin\r\ngave way to another State of the West African subregion\r\nthat had never served on the Council and was\r\nsubsequently elected. In 1993 Benin did so a second time,\r\nto the benefit of Guinea-Bissau, which then decided to\r\nwithdraw. Under those circumstances, in 1995 Benin\r\nmaintains its candidature against that of Guinea-Bissau,\r\nwhich lost its turn by withdrawing in 1993.\r\nMy delegation is ready to supply any delegation with\r\nany additional information they may desire.\r\nDemocratically renewed Benin is prepared to serve Africa\r\nand the international community in the Security Council,\r\nand we know that we can rely on all Member States of\r\nthe Organization for our election.\r\nMr. Gaussot (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nCertain delegations, one of them in virulent terms, have\r\nonce again today referred to the question of nuclear tests.\r\nIn particular, it has been stated that the recent tests\r\nconducted by France were counter to the commitments\r\nentered into when the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was\r\nextended. In addition, it was said that my country had\r\nstated its intention to continue tests without any further\r\ndetails, as if there were a question of an indefinite time\r\nperiod.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 October 1995\r\nMy delegation wishes to stress that such a statement\r\nof France’s attitude does not tally with the facts. First,\r\nFrance has not announced its intention to continue its\r\nnuclear testing indefinitely; on the contrary, we have stated\r\nour decision to complete it by engaging in a final series\r\nlimited to a few tests, which will be concluded before\r\n31 May 1996. On that date France will have once and for\r\nall renounced all nuclear tests to the extent that other\r\nStates, as it hopes, undertake to join it under the terms of\r\na nuclear-test-ban treaty.\r\nSecondly, it is not true that the latest round of tests is\r\ncounter to our commitments. When the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty was extended France never stated that it would\r\nconduct no further testing during the negotiation of a future\r\ntest-ban treaty. Our commitment was to exercise the utmost\r\nrestraint, which we have done by strictly limiting our latest\r\ntest to the number that is technologically indispensable.\r\nUtmost restraint, however, does not mean a ban.\r\nLastly, my delegation recalls, with regard to the\r\nwording of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, that France was\r\nthe first nuclear Power state that it favoured the so-called\r\nzero option — that is, a treaty banning all nuclear tests or\r\nexplosion at any level. It is the ongoing last stage of our\r\ntesting programme that enables us strongly to advocate that\r\noption, which is clearly the strictest and most satisfactory\r\nwith regard to the scope of a future comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty.\r\nMr. Laclaustra (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe Spanish delegation wishes to respond to certain aspects\r\nof the statement made this afternoon by the Minister of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Equatorial\r\nGuinea.\r\nFirst of all, my delegation wishes to reiterate firmly\r\nand clearly that the policy of the Spanish Government\r\nwith regard to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea can in\r\nno respect be interpreted as interference in the internal\r\naffairs of that country. Quite the contrary, for years Spain\r\nhas been providing Equatorial Guinea with assistance for\r\nthe reconstruction and development of the country. This\r\nassistance focuses principally on the health, education and\r\ncommunications sectors, and is provided for the benefit of\r\nthe population of Equatorial Guinea.\r\nMoreover, Spain and other countries, together with\r\nthe European Union and the United Nations, have been\r\ncooperating with the authorities of Equatorial Guinea,\r\nresponding to their requests with a view to the peaceful\r\nunfolding of the process of democratization in Equatorial\r\nGuinea, including through preparation and monitoring of\r\nthe recent municipal elections.\r\nWithin the framework of the United Nations Charter,\r\nSpain is also prepared to scrutinize respect for human\r\nrights in Equatorial Guinea in conformity with the\r\ninternational obligations that bind the Government of\r\nEquatorial Guinea.\r\nI want to stress that this policy of Spain falls fully\r\nwithin the framework of the principles laid down in the\r\ndeclaration on Equatorial Guinea adopted by the States\r\nmembers of the European Union in April 1992.\r\nIn brief, there are three basic elements to Spain’s\r\npolicy towards Equatorial Guinea: cooperation for the\r\neconomic and social development of the people of\r\nEquatorial Guinea; encouragement of political dialogue\r\nand the holding of free elections in the context of a\r\npeaceful process; and promotion of basic human rights.\r\nAll of this is in conformity with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThus, the comments made by the Minister of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Equatorial Guinea\r\nto the effect that Spanish authorities are attempting to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of his country are\r\ncompletely unfounded.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
