(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Obadi (Yemen),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\ncall on the first speaker on our list this morning, the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Swaziland, His Excellency\r\nMr. Arthur R.V. Khoza.\r\nMr. Khoza (Swaziland): I bring with me the warmest\r\ngreetings and good wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III,\r\nHer Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Government and the\r\npeople of the Kingdom of Swaziland, to all our friends and\r\nfellow Members of the United Nations.\r\nSwaziland extends its congratulations to Mr. Freitas do\r\nAmaral on his election to the presidency of this historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly, and commends his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his\r\nleadership and direction as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its deep appreciation to our distinguished Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his relentless\r\nefforts in directing the affairs of our vast Organization, and\r\nwhose skill and diplomacy have contributed so much to our\r\nachievements over the past twelve months.\r\nEach year since 1945 the General Assembly has\r\nprovided us with a chance to reflect on our achievements,\r\nas well as on our failures over the preceding twelve\r\nmonths; the goals we have met and others which, for a\r\nvariety reasons, have been missed. This process of self-\r\nassessment is an essential element of any organization;\r\nand for the United Nations there is a special significance\r\nto our deliberations this year as we mark fifty years of its\r\nexistence.\r\nPerhaps the most important development of the last\r\nfive decades has been the emergence of a new world\r\norder, in both political and economic terms, brought about\r\nby the transformation of many parts of the world through\r\nnew-found freedom and independence from both colonial\r\ndomination and oppressive ideologies.\r\nHopes continue to be raised that this new world\r\norder would result in a strengthened commitment to\r\nachieve common development objectives on a truly global\r\nbasis. Never before have the nations of the world been\r\ngiven this opportunity to work together, with collective\r\nresponsibility, towards achieving real global security —\r\nsocial, economic and political — for all our peoples.\r\nThere have undoubtedly been many encouraging\r\nsigns that we are taking our responsibilities towards one\r\nanother seriously, but we remain a long way behind in\r\nrealizing the ambitions of those ideals on which the\r\nUnited Nations was established.\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nThe foundations of our Organization were built on the\r\nruins of a world torn apart by war. \"Never again\" was the\r\ncry of all mankind, and our structures and principles were\r\nfocused on the equal development of all nations, and on the\r\nprevention of the occurrences of such destruction ever\r\nagain.\r\nAnd yet, with all the commitment and promises, it\r\nseems that only very recently have we seen any progress\r\ntowards global peace in this century. Certainly, the end of\r\nthe cold war did not bring the world-wide stability\r\nenvisaged by all of us at that time. Events such as the Gulf\r\nWar, the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia and the genocide\r\nin Rwanda have shaken our belief that human beings could\r\never live peacefully, side by side, with one another.\r\nRecent developments have shown, however, that there\r\nis a new mood abroad — one that is based on a spirit of\r\nreconciliation and a desire for peace that gives us all reason\r\nfor hope that real progress towards lasting global stability\r\nmay be possible after all. Swaziland recognizes the role of\r\nthe United Nations in bringing about this new climate of\r\npromise, and our Organization deserves great credit in its\r\ncontinuing commitment to this noble aim.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joins the rest of the\r\nresponsible world in welcoming the recent signing of the\r\nagreement with a view to the extension of autonomy to the\r\nPalestinian people in the West Bank. This latest agreement\r\nconfirms the commitment of the Israeli and Palestinian\r\npeoples to a lasting settlement of the problem that has hung\r\nlike a dark cloud over the Middle East for so long. We\r\ncongratulate all who have been involved in the process\r\nleading to the agreement, but most of all, we applaud the\r\nspirit of reconciliation of the leaders and both peoples and\r\ntheir commitment to peace. We appeal to all in the Middle\r\nEast region to embrace the same spirit so that future\r\ngenerations will never have to experience the instability and\r\nuncertainty of the past.\r\nThere are encouraging signs, too, evident in recent\r\ndevelopments with regard to the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Last month the world witnessed the first steps\r\ntowards the prospect of a settlement in the Balkans. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland prays that the momentum will\r\ncontinue until a solution may be found that is acceptable to\r\nall in that troubled area. Swaziland welcomes the recent\r\ninitiative leading to the signing of an agreement in\r\nWashington and agrees that the first priority, now, must be\r\nto ensure a lasting cease-fire and to create an atmosphere\r\nin which the people who have suffered so much in recent\r\nyears may at last begin to bring some order into their\r\nbroken lives.\r\nThe past twelve months have seen major and\r\nwelcome progress in a number of troubled areas on our\r\nown continent of Africa, while other regrettable situations\r\nhave surfaced to threaten the stability of the continent as\r\na whole.\r\nClearly, the commitment of all African countries to\r\nthe establishment by the Organization of African Unity of\r\na mechanism for the prevention, management and\r\nresolution of conflicts is central to Africa’s efforts in\r\naccepting responsibility for its own problems. Swaziland\r\nstrongly supports this initiative and joins its brother\r\nAfrican States in calling for the support of the United\r\nNations in this important enterprise.\r\nSwaziland has been especially heartened by the\r\ndevelopments towards a lasting settlement in Angola,\r\nengineered to a large degree by the efforts of our United\r\nNations Special Envoy. The signing of the Lusaka peace\r\naccord has brought real hope that the two sides to the\r\nconflict are now committed to peace and that the Angolan\r\npeople will now be given the chance to make a new start\r\nin a country that has the potential to play such a vital role\r\nin the development of the subregion as a whole. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland stands ready to support and to\r\nencourage the development of Angola and its people.\r\nSwaziland commends the efforts made by the\r\ninternational community and the neighbouring countries\r\nof Rwanda and Burundi in bringing about an atmosphere\r\nof relative calm to the two countries after a time of great\r\nsuffering and hardship.\r\nOf particular note has been the role of those\r\ncountries playing host to so many refugees from the\r\nconflicts in the area. Swaziland knows full well — and\r\nwith recent firsthand experience — the problems\r\nassociated with such a task. It is an obligation to one’s\r\nfellow human beings to offer refuge in times of conflict,\r\nbut however willing a country may be to welcome\r\nrefugees from conflict and strife, the strain on the host\r\ncountry’s resources may be too great for them to cope\r\nwith alone, and outside help is absolutely critical. The\r\nrole of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees is essential in this regard, and we commend the\r\nwork of that Office wherever it is needed.\r\nIn the course of the 50 years of its operation, our\r\nOrganization has learnt many valuable lessons, including\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nthe realization that we must adapt to changing\r\ncircumstances and to the varying needs of all our Members.\r\nThe challenges facing us have grown and spread into areas\r\non a scale perhaps not imagined by our founders —\r\nchallenges such as international security and peace-keeping,\r\nthe promotion of justice and democracy, and the fight\r\nagainst economic and social inequalities among the\r\nMembers of our family of nations.\r\nAnd as the roles of the United Nations expand and\r\ndevelop, so should our capacity to undertake them. Reform\r\nand adaptability are the key imperatives for us as we\r\napproach the new millennium, and in this spirit, we\r\nwelcome the new agendas for peace and development\r\nwhich have been initiated under the guidance of our\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThese initiatives, which are at the heart of what we are\r\ntrying to achieve here, create particular obligations for all\r\nour Members and for the Organization itself: we all have a\r\nresponsibility to demonstrate real commitment towards the\r\nprinciples we all have accepted. Thus, our calls for\r\nextended United Nations peace-keeping must be supported\r\nby full and timely contributions to the relevant budget by\r\nall countries, and by a commitment to global peace, which\r\nhas clearly been lacking in many areas of the world.\r\nThis commitment embraces the issue that has posed\r\npossibly the greatest threat to global security in the second\r\nhalf of this century: that of containing the spread of nuclear\r\nweapons and, ultimately, achieving a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nworld.\r\nIn this context, Swaziland enthusiastically supported,\r\nearlier this year, the application to extend indefinitely the\r\nTreaty on nuclear non-proliferation, and we look forward to\r\na successful conclusion to the negotiations on a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nSwaziland is confident that the Secretariat of the\r\nUnited Nations, under the wise and able leadership of His\r\nExcellency the Secretary-General, is all too aware of its\r\nown responsibilities to adapt and reform elements of the\r\nOrganization’s structures, in line with the wishes of its\r\nMembers and with regard to achieving efficiency,\r\nadaptability and full representation of the global community\r\nin order to meet its requirements.\r\nCertainly, we all must feel represented in the key\r\ndecision-making bodies of the Organization, and Swaziland\r\ntherefore supports the proposals aimed, in the first place, at\r\nmaking the Security Council a more credible body by\r\nintroducing wider representation among the permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nThe principle of full representation within the United\r\nNations is an extension of the founding principle of\r\nuniversality — to ensure, as much as possible, that all\r\npeoples of the world feel that they are represented in the\r\none truly global Organization with the resources and\r\ninfluence to effect developments for the good of mankind.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to have a\r\nstrong and happy partnership with a country whose people\r\nbelieve that they are denied the opportunity to make their\r\ncontribution to the rest of the world through the agencies\r\nof our Organization, and who maintain that they are\r\nexcluded from the processes of international\r\ndecision-making, to which they have a right to contribute.\r\nThe Republic of China and its 21 million people have\r\nshown themselves to be committed to global peace and\r\ndevelopment, and ready to share with the rest of the\r\nworld their knowledge, expertise and resources.\r\nIn the fiftieth year of the existence of United\r\nNations, and as we celebrate the historic signing of our\r\nCharter, it is surely fitting that we live up to our\r\nfounders’ belief that the credibility of our Organization is\r\ndependent on the principle that all mankind is represented\r\nhere. The declaration by a people that it believes itself to\r\nbe denied representation is surely incentive enough for us\r\nto at least consider the case, whatever the outcome. The\r\nRepublic of China, as one of the original signatories,\r\nbelieves that its appeal deserves to be heard. Swaziland\r\ntherefore encourages the growing support for the\r\nestablishment of an ad hoc committee to look into the\r\nissue of the renewal of membership of the United Nations\r\nfor the Republic of China.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has welcomed the far-\r\nsighted Agenda for Development, including the Africa-\r\nspecific development initiatives for the 1990s, which\r\ncontain the Organization’s operational priorities in the\r\narea of economic and social development, and aims to\r\nensure sustainable growth for our economies. As we\r\napproach the mid-term review of the continent’s\r\ndevelopment plan, it is clear that we still lag far behind\r\nthe other regions of the world in terms of achieving our\r\ndevelopment targets.\r\nSwaziland has been conscientious in attending the\r\nrecent round of important United Nations summit\r\nconferences, which have focused on key social and\r\neconomic development issues, including those on the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nenvironment and development, on population and\r\ndevelopment, and this year’s social summit and Conference\r\non Women. In each case, we have committed ourselves to\r\nthe plans of action and are doing our best to implement the\r\nrecommendations.\r\nA side effect of these meetings was that once again\r\nthey highlighted our continent’s limitations. While the\r\ncountries of Africa recognize our responsibilities to our\r\nown people, it is clear that our resources, technical\r\nknowledge and all-round expertise do not yet allow us to\r\nprogress as fast as we would like. Undoubtedly, we will\r\ncontinue to require the support and understanding of the\r\ndeveloped world if we are ever to rid ourselves of\r\ndependency on outside assistance, and, certainly, the United\r\nNations has a major role to play in the process.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has not been standing still\r\nin its own efforts to promote economic measures aimed at\r\nimproving the living standards of its people. As is our\r\ncustom, we have consulted directly with the entire nation to\r\ngive the Swazi people themselves the opportunity to\r\ndetermine priorities for their economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The focus of our people’s concerns has been\r\non much of what has been discussed at the recent United\r\nNations conferences, and there is a direct parallel between\r\nthe recommendations of the various Summits and those of\r\nour own consultation process. The value of this national\r\nexercise, in a United Nations context, is that it confirms\r\nsupport for what the Organization is doing at the level of\r\nthose who matter most.\r\nIncluded among the issues raised in our national\r\neconomic exercise were concern over the continuing\r\ndrought and the realization that any plans we may have to\r\nimprove our economic performance will still depend to a\r\nlarge extent on the inconsistencies of nature, unless we can\r\noffset the effects of poor rainfall by large capital projects\r\nto harness our water resources.\r\nAn increase in cross-border illegal traffic in drugs and\r\nweapons continues to present a threat to our socio-economic\r\nstability, and as a sign of our commitment to overcome this\r\ngrowing danger the Kingdom of Swaziland and the\r\nRepublic of South Africa recently signed a joint agreement\r\nto work together to combat cross-border crime. It is clear,\r\nhowever, that what is needed is international support to\r\novercome what is certainly an international menace.\r\nThe Swazi nation has confirmed the importance of\r\nincreasing environmental awareness amongst our people,\r\nand the need to protect our natural heritage is recognized as\r\na priority target. Land usage and agricultural\r\ndiversification are important elements of this vital issue\r\nand we will need to acquire technical support to achieve\r\nimprovement.\r\nAnother key element of the nation’s concerns is\r\ncentred on the role of women. Swazi women are\r\nidentified as the backbone of the economy and it has been\r\nrecommended that steps be taken to bring the legal rights\r\nof our women onto an equal basis with those of our men.\r\nOnce more, the traditions and culture of our\r\nKingdom have been reaffirmed as the main contributing\r\ncause of our stability and peace. Our national identity is\r\nimportant to us — it is, after all, what makes us\r\nunique — and Swaziland feels strongly that there should\r\nbe recognition of and respect for each country’s\r\ndistinctiveness in the way we each approach an issue and\r\nin the solutions we find to our own problems.\r\nAs the world’s leaders gather here later this month\r\nto reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding\r\nCharter, let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal\r\na new start for our Organization, a new beginning in\r\nwhich we will address the challenges to global security\r\nand development with a fresh sense of equal\r\nresponsibility and duty and with new structures in place\r\nto achieve our united goal of improving the world we live\r\nin for all our peoples. The Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nconfirms its own commitment to our founding Charter\r\nand declares its pride in the Organization in which the\r\nhopes of all mankind are placed. May God bless these\r\nproceedings with the success they deserve.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guyana,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Clement Rohee.\r\nMr. Rohee (Guyana): In another two weeks we will\r\nbe commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of this\r\nOrganization. We shall do so with much ceremony. I\r\nwould hope, however, that we will go beyond the\r\nceremonial to take the opportunity which the occasion\r\nprovides us to reflect further on the role of the\r\nOrganization and on the ways and means by which its\r\nperformance can be enhanced to serve better the needs of\r\nits Members in the coming twenty-first century.\r\nWe offer Mr. Freitas do Amaral our warmest\r\ncongratulations on his election. We are confident that,\r\nwith his demonstrated ability and skills, he will advance\r\nus even further in our task of reforming and restructuring\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nthe Organization so that it may successfully confront the\r\nchallenges which the post-cold-war era has brought. He\r\nmay be sure that we will fully cooperate with him to make\r\nthe deliberations of the fiftieth session of this Assembly as\r\nconstructive as possible.\r\nMy Government is grateful to the outgoing President\r\nof the Assembly, Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, for the\r\ninitiatives which he took during his term of office to\r\nimprove the functioning of the institution at this critical\r\ntime of its existence.\r\nWe would also wish to say a special word of\r\nappreciation to the distinguished Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and his staff for their\r\ncontinuing devotion to the servicing of our many\r\nrequirements. Their support for our efforts will undoubtedly\r\nguarantee our ultimate success.\r\nIt is vitally important that the dynamism and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations be increased if it is\r\nadequately to discharge its many tasks. Since the\r\nOrganization was founded almost five decades ago, the\r\nworld has changed considerably and international problems\r\nhave become much more complex. The United Nations\r\ntoday bears a heavier load of responsibility than ever\r\nbefore. Ironically, at the same time, it is saddled with a\r\ndeepening financial crisis which makes its effectiveness and\r\nits very future highly uncertain. This situation cannot\r\ncontinue without adverse consequences for the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe expanding nature of many peace-keeping\r\noperations not only places an added financial strain on the\r\nfinances of the United Nations, but is especially\r\nburdensome for small developing countries, such as mine,\r\nwhich are finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil our\r\nfinancial obligations to the Organization. Support for these\r\noperations represents a continuing drain on our limited\r\nresources and hampers our own efforts at development. Yet\r\nas conflicts multiply the United Nations will be called upon\r\nto mount more operations to keep the peace.\r\nGiven the urgency of these demands, we have no\r\nchoice but to try and meet them. The time has therefore\r\ncome for us to put the financing of these undertakings on\r\na more reliable footing. We urge all States, especially the\r\nmajor defaulting countries, to honour fully their obligations\r\nto the Organization.\r\nIt must be a matter of growing concern to the\r\ninternational community that the peace and prosperity\r\nexpected in the aftermath of the cold war have not\r\nmaterialized. The world continues to face some of the\r\nworst threats to international stability. Violent conflicts\r\narising from resurgent nationalisms and religious\r\nintolerance between and within States have proliferated.\r\nThe unresolved situations in Afghanistan, Rwanda, parts\r\nof the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia\r\nhave caused severe loss of life and destruction to property\r\nand have given rise to humanitarian crises of immense\r\nproportions.\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains\r\nuncertain. The suffering of the Bosnian people, the total\r\ndisregard for the safe havens and the constant threat to\r\nthe international peace-keeping force demands that the\r\ninternational community take effective measures to end\r\nthis senseless conflict. We welcome the prospects of a\r\npeaceful settlement which have resulted from the latest\r\ndiplomatic initiative. With the international Tribunal for\r\nthe former Yugoslavia now established, we hope that\r\nthose responsible for the atrocities committed against the\r\nBosnian people will be brought to trial.\r\nWe are equally concerned with the situation in\r\nCyprus which, despite the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, appears to be worsening. There are reports of\r\nescalating tensions. We urge both sides to the dispute to\r\nrespond urgently to his call for a negotiated solution\r\nwhich would preserve the island’s sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nAlthough the Middle East continues to be volatile,\r\nwe have reason today to believe that a comprehensive\r\npeace can be a reality in the not-too-distant future. The\r\naccords already signed between Israel and the Palestinians\r\non the one hand and Israel and Jordan on the other show\r\na willingness to reach a just and lasting solution. These\r\nachievements should serve as a catalyst for new\r\ninitiatives. Many issues such as the refugee problem,\r\nsecurity arrangements and borders, fundamental to the\r\nPalestine question, remain to be settled. The recent high-\r\nlevel negotiations between the Prime Minister of Israel\r\nand the President of Palestine must be considered a\r\npositive development. We hope that all remaining\r\ndifficulties can be resolved in good faith by both sides\r\nwith the help of this Organization and the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn our own region we are pleased to see that peace\r\nand stability have been restored to a large degree in Haiti.\r\nMuch has been accomplished since the return of the\r\ndemocratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nOctober 1994. We note in particular the practical steps\r\ntaken by the Government of Haiti to organize free and fair\r\nlegislative elections, as called for in Security Council\r\nresolution 940 (1994). The first of these elections has\r\nshown that more has to be done in terms of establishing an\r\neffective electoral machinery. The role of the International\r\nCivilian Mission and the United Nations Mission in Haiti\r\n(UNMIH) in assisting the Haitian authorities to reinforce\r\ndemocracy remains crucial. The sustained commitment of\r\nthe international community is indispensable to the\r\nprospects for long-term progress in Haiti. My Government\r\nis ready to provide whatever assistance it can to achieve\r\nthis goal.\r\nToday more than ever, the people of the world are\r\nmaking the United Nations the repository of their hopes.\r\nThe Organization must therefore do its utmost to satisfy\r\nthese expanded expectations. It must undertake whatever\r\ninstitutional reforms are necessary for adapting itself to the\r\nnew international context. The urgency of our agenda\r\nmakes it imperative for us to conclude as early as possible\r\nthe work under way in the many Working Groups to secure\r\nthe rationalization of our agenda, as well as the reform of\r\nthe major organs of the United Nations. These reforms,\r\nwhich we believe to be essential and urgent, must be\r\ncarried out with transparency and on a consensual basis.\r\nThey must be realistic and be aimed at increasing\r\nefficiency. Above all, they must be in full accordance with\r\nthe democratic purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nIn so far as the reform of the Security Council is\r\nconcerned, my Government supports an appropriate increase\r\nin membership. Such an increase should take account of the\r\nsize of the current membership of the Organization and be\r\nreflective of the principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation. The discussions in the Working Group that\r\nwas set up in accordance with resolution 48/26 have\r\nproduced several interesting proposals for reform. These\r\nshould now be more closely examined and evaluated to\r\ndetermine their feasibility. It is possible, we believe, to find\r\nan arrangement that would respond satisfactorily to the need\r\nfor enhancing the Council’s capacity to preserve\r\ninternational peace and security in the post-cold-war era.\r\nA major responsibility of any reformed Council should\r\nbe to give further impetus to the disarmament process. The\r\ndecision taken by the 1995 Review and Extension\r\nConference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) to extend the agreement\r\nindefinitely reflects the commitment of all parties involved\r\nto work towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. The\r\nextension of the Treaty, however, is not an end in itself. It\r\nmust be followed by further steps towards complete\r\nnuclear disarmament, the dissemination of nuclear know-\r\nhow for peaceful purposes, adequate security assurances\r\nto non-nuclear-weapon States and the establishment of\r\nnuclear-weapon free zones. Especially important is the\r\nneed to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty in order\r\nto preclude nuclear-weapon States from undertaking\r\nfurther hazardous experiments. We urge the Conference\r\non Disarmament to proceed as expeditiously as possible\r\nto the elaboration of a universal and effective treaty\r\nwithin a fixed time frame.\r\nThe nuclear threat, as well as other hazards to which\r\nwe are exposed, must make us all actually aware of our\r\nobligation to protect our fragile environment. Since the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, we have made some progress in a number\r\nof areas with regard to the implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nWe have seen the coming into force of the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change\r\nand the Convention to Combat Desertification, as well as\r\nthe holding in Barbados of the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates and the adoption of the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction. Much more, however, remains to be done if we\r\nare adequately to honour the commitments made in Rio.\r\nThe terrible destruction inflicted recently by\r\npowerful hurricanes on several sister States in the\r\nCaribbean Community shows how vulnerable small States\r\nare to environmental disasters. Only two months ago my\r\nown country suffered major ecological damage as a result\r\nof severe leakages from the tailings pond dam at the\r\nOmai Gold Mines in the Essequibo region, causing some\r\n1.2 million cubic metres of cyanide slurry to be\r\ndischarged into the environment. Aquatic life in the river\r\nwas endangered, while the inhabitants of nearby villages\r\nwere exposed to serious health hazards. Fortunately, the\r\nGovernment of Guyana was able, with the assistance of\r\nfriendly Governments and agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem, to contain the danger. These disasters, both\r\nnatural and man-made, point to the need for urgent\r\ninternational action to protect small countries such as\r\nours.\r\nYet, three years after the Rio Conference, the\r\ncommitments to provide financial resources to implement\r\nAgenda 21 remain largely on paper. The target of 0.7 per\r\ncent of official development assistance is still to be\r\nrealized. New resources have simply not been available to\r\nundertake some of the programmes specified in the\r\nAgenda. Nor have we witnessed any significant transfer\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nof suitable technology to developing countries. While the\r\ndeveloping countries are ready to discharge their\r\nobligations, developed countries balk at making their\r\ncontribution. The global partnership, which was so highly\r\nadvocated and praised at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, is yet to be formed.\r\nWe are nevertheless encouraged by the adoption last\r\nAugust of the Draft Agreement for the Implementation of\r\nthe Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks\r\nand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. We hope that this\r\nAgreement, which will be opened for signature on\r\n4 December 1995, will ensure the long-term conservation\r\nand sustainable use of the living resources of the high seas\r\nidentified in Agenda 21. This Agreement and the larger\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\r\ncame into force in November 1994, are important to the\r\nsustainable development of the fishing industry in small\r\nStates such as ours. We urge their full observance and\r\nimplementation.\r\nOverall economic development remains the single\r\nmost important challenge facing Member States and,\r\nconsequently, the United Nations. At various conferences,\r\nincluding the World Summit for Social Development, which\r\nwas held in Copenhagen, Denmark, last March, we have\r\nrepeatedly expressed our political will to address our\r\ndiverse economic and social problems. We came away from\r\nCopenhagen ready to act, but we remain uncertain as to the\r\nway forward. Now that the Beijing Conference on women\r\nis behind us, the international community needs to summon\r\neven greater determination if it is to translate into action the\r\nbold decisions we have taken in this series of important\r\nsummit meetings. These decisions should now be\r\nconsolidated, and specific machinery set up for their\r\nimplementation. It would indeed be a great pity if the\r\npainfully negotiated results of these high-level deliberations\r\nwere left to evaporate.\r\nThe great divide between rich and poor, both among\r\nand within nations, must be considered a threat to world\r\npeace. The plight of developing countries, particularly the\r\nleast-developed countries, compels urgent action. The\r\nproblems of development, or rather of underdevelopment,\r\ncan no longer be dealt with adequately on an ad hoc and\r\npiecemeal basis or through questionable structural-\r\nadjustment measures. What is required is fundamental\r\nreform of the international economic system, which\r\ncontinues to marginalize developing countries into a\r\nposition of perpetual dependence. It is necessary to define\r\nnew strategies and to agree on new modalities to reverse\r\nthe present inequities in international economic relations.\r\nThe developing countries are willing to do their part\r\nin providing an environment favourable to growth.\r\nHowever, they urgently need significant debt relief,\r\ngreater financial investment flows, the transfer of\r\nappropriate technology, the elimination of tariff and\r\nnon-tariff barriers and just remuneration for commodities\r\nand raw materials. These are not new prescriptions; they\r\nare generally known to be essential for development.\r\nThus far, however, developed countries have evinced\r\nnotable reluctance to follow them, preferring instead to\r\ndispense small amounts of bilateral aid. Most of them\r\nhave now further reduced this limited assistance. The root\r\nproblems therefore remain unresolved.\r\nThe signing, in Marrakesh in 1994, of the Uruguay\r\nRound agreements has provided some hope that the\r\nplaying-field for international trade will be levelled to\r\ninduce the participation of developing countries. The\r\nrecently created World Trade Organization, if properly\r\noriented, may be able to provide a rule-based system that\r\ncould encourage such participation. There is much to be\r\nsaid for the introduction of predictability into international\r\neconomic relations, and we should therefore work to\r\nensure that it is provided in whatever agreements we\r\nreach. The “Agenda for Development”, which we are in\r\nthe process of elaborating, must embody the rights and\r\nobligations accepted by the parties.\r\nIn this context, Guyana attaches great importance to\r\nthe conclusion of work on the Agenda. We view the\r\nAgenda as an overarching framework for international\r\ncooperation for development. We are therefore concerned\r\nthat, while we work to establish the framework, we\r\nshould also secure the necessary commitment of resources\r\nfor effective implementation. In this regard, we believe\r\nthat South-South cooperation should be considered as an\r\nintegral and important element of international\r\ncooperation for development. International support for\r\ngreater South-South cooperation cannot but enhance the\r\nprospects for world development, thereby increasing the\r\npotentialities of interdependence and partnership.\r\nEconomic growth cannot be sustained for long\r\nunless each individual citizen and each individual\r\ncommunity has a stake in that growth and is empowered\r\nto take an active part in the development process.\r\nMoreover, economic growth would be meaningless if it\r\nwere not equitably distributed. A society cannot find\r\nfulfilment in growth. Indeed, the development process\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nitself is severely hampered if a society does not take\r\nadequate care of its vulnerable groups: women, children,\r\nethnic minorities, the handicapped and the homeless.\r\nDevelopment must therefore have a social dimension.\r\nConscious of this need, the President of Guyana,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Cheddi Jagan, has advanced the concept\r\nof a new global human order. An essential feature of this\r\norder would be the consensus that has now emerged in\r\nrespect of development and governance, the role of the\r\nState and the market and sustainable environmentalism.\r\nWhile this consensus is to be welcomed, it is attended by\r\nnew social, economic and political problems which will\r\neffectively prevent it from taking us forward. The solution\r\nof these problems calls for a new global commitment to\r\nhuman ideals and universal human development. In his own\r\naddress to the Assembly, President Jagan will expand on\r\nthis proposal with a view to securing an appropriate\r\ndeclaration on a new global order to which all States can\r\nsubscribe.\r\nAs I said at the outset of my statement, we must not\r\nbe content with merely celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. The critical situation in which the\r\nworld now finds itself demands from us a supreme effort to\r\nmake full use of the opportunities which this historical\r\nconjuncture offers. The possibilities of interdependence and\r\ninternational cooperation have never been greater. We owe\r\nit to ourselves and to future generations to grasp the chance\r\nwe now have for creating a truly just and humane society\r\nof nations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Solomon Islands, His Excellency\r\nMr. Danny Philip.\r\nMr. Philip (Solomon Islands): It is indeed fitting that\r\nthis historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly is\r\nbeing presided over by Mr. Freitas do Amara of Portugal,\r\na distinguished teacher of law, an experienced\r\nparliamentarian, and the founder of one of the major\r\npolitical parties that helped to return vibrant democracy to\r\nhis homeland. He will meet the challenges of this office\r\nwith the intellect and skill that have marked his service to\r\nhis country and region.\r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Amara Essy, who presided over\r\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, has my\r\nwarmest appreciation of his leadership through a complex\r\nagenda.\r\nI salute the Secretary-General as well as the women\r\nand men of the Secretariat, the specialized agencies and\r\nother bodies of the United Nations for their extraordinary\r\nwork during this difficult time in the Organization’s\r\nhistory.\r\nI embrace the representatives of Palau, the newest\r\nMember State — our sister in the South Pacific region.\r\nWe of Solomon Islands, a politically stable\r\ndemocracy, live in peace, but we have known the cruelty\r\nand havoc of modern war. Not only did the Battle of\r\nGuadalcanal in the Second World War inflict damage on\r\nour natural environment, leaving behind untold numbers\r\nof dangerous armaments, but it caused adverse effects on\r\nhuman and economic development as well. We number\r\nless than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic origins, speak\r\nsome 87 distinct languages in various dialects, and live\r\ntogether on hundreds of islands spread over 1600 square\r\nkilometres of ocean. We live in a part of the world of\r\nexquisite beauty with a delicate marine and forest ecology\r\nthat is critical to our well-being and survival.\r\nFrom the perspective of my country, peace and\r\ndevelopment are inextricably linked. The Agenda for\r\nDevelopment and the Agenda for Peace make this as clear\r\nas the brilliant and pollution-free waters of our sun-\r\ndrenched lagoons. In his latest report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, the Secretary-General observed that\r\ndevelopment:\r\n“the foremost and most far-reaching task of our time\r\n... must be seen in its many dimensions — in the\r\ncontexts of peace, the economy, environmental\r\nprotection, social justice and democracy”. (A/50/1,\r\npara. 182)\r\nEach is critical for development, but without peace the\r\nother dimensions shrink like characters in stories for\r\nchildren.\r\nWe applaud the Secretary-General’s efforts to\r\nimplement the Agenda for Peace. The development of a\r\nframework for coordinating the planning and\r\nimplementation of complex field operations is welcome.\r\nIn its efforts to broker peace, the United Nations has\r\nwrestled with seemingly intractable problems. Solomon\r\nIslands, one of the least developed countries, living in\r\npeace, gladly contributes its financial share to peace-\r\nkeeping and supports initiatives to protect United Nations\r\npersonnel and to aid civilian populations.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nYet, ethnic strife and armed conflict rage in many\r\nplaces with suffering and devastation beyond\r\ncomprehension. The violation of human rights continues.\r\nPoverty saps the creativity and vitality of thousands of\r\nmillions. Vast numbers of children, especially female\r\nchildren, do not have their basic needs met and many do\r\nnot survive infancy or early childhood. Solomon Islands,\r\nwhich reaffirms its commitment to the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child, applauds the work of the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund. Minimal education, illiteracy,\r\nlabouring in unspeakable conditions, prostitution and life on\r\nthe streets are the conditions of many children. The mass\r\nmedia with an educational purpose have a powerful role in\r\nchanging all of this as Solomon Islanders living in\r\ncommunities separated by the sea have learned. Moreover,\r\nmany of the world’s women continue to face serious\r\neconomic and social discrimination as the 1995 Human\r\nDevelopment Report to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme demonstrates. The education of women in\r\nSolomon Islands is critical to them, their children, their\r\nfamilies and the nation. Without it, sustainable development\r\nand the levelling of population growth are unattainable\r\ngoals.\r\nSolomon Islands applauds the steps taken by the\r\nUnited States of America and the Russian Federation to\r\nreduce their nuclear arsenals in accordance with Start I, on\r\nthe reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. We\r\nlook forward to agreement on and implementation of the\r\nTreaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic\r\nOffensive Arms (Start II).\r\nSolomon Islands and its sister States in the Pacific\r\nregion fearfully watch the ominous nuclear-weapons tests\r\nof France and the People’s Republic of China. We\r\nespecially deplore the fact that France is conducting them\r\nin the South Pacific with its fragile marine ecology\r\nessential to the lives of island peoples. Recent reports in the\r\nFrench media indicate that the potential danger of these\r\ntests is far greater than we have been led to believe. The\r\nthreats to people, animals and plants — even the genetic\r\nfoundations of life — are terribly real. Do we need\r\nadditional evidence of this after Hiroshima and Nagasaki?\r\nWhy are more nuclear tests really required? How valid is\r\nthe concept of nuclear deterrence now? If, as France claims,\r\nnuclear-weapons explosions on Mururoa Atoll and\r\nFangataufa Atoll in French Polynesia are so safe, why not\r\nset them off in the soil of the mother country? Its presence\r\nin Polynesia and New Caledonia makes France our\r\nneighbour in the Pacific where a post-cold-war redefinition\r\nof the region is well under way. Do good neighbours\r\nendanger the environment that sustains them? Are we not\r\ngambling away the future of humankind at the nuclear-\r\nweapons dice table? To the nuclear-threshold States, these\r\ntests send the wrong signal. The Pacific is certainly the\r\nwrong place; now, today, is the wrong time; and for\r\ninternational cooperation, this is the wrong policy.\r\nGlobal warming, as the intergovernmental climate-\r\nchange experts are now confirming, continues. The\r\nconsequences for the small island States are most serious,\r\nincluding the potential impact of sea-level rise. They\r\nthreaten our agricultural and fish production, thereby\r\nendangering our economy and undermining our ability to\r\ndevelop. Clearly, this global problem requires a global\r\nsolution, but the industrial countries must take the lead if\r\njoint solutions are to be successfully implemented.\r\nSolomon Islands is contributing to the quest for\r\ninternational peace and security in a number of ways.\r\nTowards disarmament, we have ratified the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and we\r\ntook an active part in the NPT Review and Extension\r\nConference, joining in the consensus to extend the NPT\r\nindefinitely. We ratified the Treaty of Rarotonga\r\nestablishing the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone.\r\nEstablishing nuclear-free zones is an important initiative\r\ntowards creating a non-proliferation regime in cooperation\r\nwith other States. Solomon Islands, along with others,\r\nmade two submissions to the International Court of\r\nJustice on the legality of the use or threat of use of\r\nnuclear weapons, a matter now before the Court.\r\nSolomon Islands is participating in the process for\r\nthe completion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty by\r\nSeptember 1996. We believe that a comprehensive test-\r\nban treaty is the fulcrum upon which nuclear disarmament\r\nwill be raised from dream to reality. Ultimately,\r\ndisarmament is a question of courage and overcoming\r\nfear. It begins within, and its achievement must come\r\nfrom within as well — inside them and us, inside you and\r\nme.\r\nAs for environmental issues, Solomon Islands is a\r\nState party to the United Nations Framework Convention\r\non Climate Change and fully supports the Berlin mandate,\r\nwhich includes the Alliance of Small Island States\r\nprotocol. With so much of our present and future\r\neconomy based on our forests and marine life, we\r\nembrace the Convention on Biological Diversity, which\r\nSolomon Islands acceded to this year, the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action, the Nouméa Convention, and the\r\nInternational Coral Reef Initiative. We support a global\r\nprogramme of action to protect the marine environment\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nfrom land-based activities. Concerned about the shipment\r\nand importation of hazardous and radioactive wastes in the\r\nSouth Pacific region, Solomon Islands endorses the Waigani\r\nConvention recently adopted at the twenty-sixth South\r\nPacific Forum, held in Papua New Guinea, and calls for the\r\nrehabilitation of former nuclear-weapon test sites and\r\nassistance to the peoples who were forced from those\r\nplaces.\r\nWe live in a world of disturbing, often cruel, contrasts.\r\nThese, sustainable development has to address. In his report\r\non the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General\r\nstates that\r\n“development at its core must be about improvement\r\nof human well-being, the removal of poverty, hunger,\r\ndisease and ignorance, ensuring productive\r\nemployment and the satisfaction of priority needs of\r\nall people in a way that can be sustained over future\r\ngenerations; ... the emerging consensus on the priority\r\nand dimensions of development should find expression\r\nin a new framework for international cooperation”.\r\n(A/50/1, para. 182)\r\nSolomon Islands views this emerging consensus as the\r\nbeginning of a new diplomacy that puts people at the heart\r\nof development. The new diplomacy should work\r\nvigorously to implement the programmes of action crafted\r\nat the World Summit for Children, the Earth Summit, the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, the International\r\nConference on Population and Development, the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, the Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates and the Fourth World Conference on Women. After\r\nHabitat II, in Istanbul next year, we do not require more\r\nlarge conferences, for the time being at least. Rather, we\r\nneed international will and partnership, political\r\ncommitment, and thoughtful, decisive action to ensure that\r\nthese programmes of action are implemented.\r\nAs the Declaration of Barbados affirms,\r\n“Small island developing nations are particularly\r\nvulnerable to natural as well as environmental\r\ndisasters and have a limited capacity to respond to and\r\nrecover from such disasters.” (A/CONF.167/9, annex\r\nI, part one, section III, para. 1)\r\nLimited in size and with vulnerable economies, they must\r\ndepend on a narrow resource base and upon international\r\ntrade, without the means to influence its terms. Solomon\r\nIslands and the other small island developing States require\r\ninternational partnership and cooperation to achieve and\r\nmaintain sustainable development.\r\nThe new diplomacy based on people-centred\r\ndevelopment has at its heart a spiritual dimension which\r\nembraces the ideals of democracy, tolerance, peaceful\r\ncoexistence, justice and the rights of persons and peoples.\r\nIt cares for the environment and rejects greed and\r\nintolerance. This new diplomacy will be a reflection of an\r\nagenda for democracy and tolerance, which Solomon\r\nIslands believes should be formulated to complete the\r\ntriad of agendas. Such an agenda ought to be a basis for\r\nreforming the United Nations in general and the Security\r\nCouncil in particular. For Security Council reform to\r\nwork, it must put people at the centre instead of a\r\ndominating nation, group of nations or region.\r\nCommitted to democracy and tolerance, Solomon\r\nIslands calls for renewed consideration of the exceptional\r\nsituation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\r\ninternational context, on the basis of the principle of\r\nuniversality and in accordance with the established model\r\nof parallel representation of divided countries at the\r\nUnited Nations. The Republic of China’s standing as the\r\nfifteenth largest trading nation in the world, with the\r\ntwentieth highest gross national product and the largest\r\nforeign-exchange holdings, its continuing assistance to\r\nmany developing countries and its efforts to strengthen\r\ninternational economic cooperation are obvious and\r\ncannot be ignored by the world’s highest forum. In\r\naddition, the Republic of China’s contribution to world\r\npeace and its unfailing support of United Nations\r\nactivities are undeniable evidence of its qualifications to\r\nreceive proper consideration for having a seat at the\r\nUnited Nations. Solomon Islands therefore calls for a\r\nrenewed focus on the issue of readmitting the Republic of\r\nChina as a Member of the United Nations.\r\nSolomon Islands believes in a United Nations that\r\ncalls for tolerance and works to practise it, a United\r\nNations that promotes the values of diversity, tolerance,\r\npluralism, peace, justice, solidarity and responsibility\r\ntowards others and unknown future generations. Here,\r\ndifferences in race, religion, language and political\r\ndoctrine are not obstacles, but challenges to\r\nunderstanding, compassion, insight and patience.\r\nThe only hope for humanity is world peace, to be\r\nachieved by a change in attitude from one of “mine and\r\nmy world” to one of “we and our world”.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Madagascar,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacques Sylla.\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair\r\nMr. Sylla (Madagascar) (interpretation from French):\r\nI must begin my statement by echoing the words of\r\nprevious speakers who have congratulated Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral on his election by acclamation to the\r\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nOn my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation of\r\nMadagascar, which I have the honour to head, I have\r\npleasure in saying that we rely greatly on his experience\r\nand wisdom in ensuring that our work will be crowned with\r\nsuccess at the conclusion of our debates. Whilst assuring\r\nhim of the cooperation and support of my delegation, I\r\nwould also like to congratulate the other officers of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to our\r\ncolleague, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Mr. Freitas do\r\nAmaral’s distinguished predecessor, for the enthusiasm and\r\ndynamism he demonstrated in the service of the General\r\nAssembly, which under his presidency carried out its\r\nmandate well and always to the satisfaction of countries\r\nlike my own.\r\nLastly, may I express our appreciation for the efforts\r\nmade by the Secretariat to ensure the efficient organization\r\nof our work, under the competent leadership of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali.\r\nSince our current session coincides with the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations Charter, it goes without saying that, as the\r\nSecretary-General stressed in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, it is an occasion not only to take stock of the\r\nfirst half-century of our Organization and to prepare for the\r\nsecond, but also to seek ways to keep up the momentum of\r\nthe first years of the decade in world affairs.\r\nAfter the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a true symbol of\r\nthe cold war, history has witnessed a series of events that\r\nstrengthen confidence in the principles and agreements\r\nenshrined in the Charter: the independence of Namibia; the\r\nformation of the first democratic multiracial Government in\r\nSouth Africa; the holding of democratic elections marking\r\nthe end of a long period of civil strife in Mozambique and\r\none-party rule in Malawi; the promising steps taken by\r\nseveral southern African countries towards reconstruction;\r\nthe process of reconciliation in the Middle East, recently\r\nadded to by the agreement — welcomed by Madagascar,\r\nalong with all other peace-loving nations — extending\r\nautonomy in the West Bank; and, lastly, certain\r\nencouraging signs with regard to the situation in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia.\r\nParadoxically, however, the end of the era of\r\nideological confrontations, while accelerating the\r\nintegration of world society, has also promoted an\r\nincrease in conflicts, sources of outbursts of violence and\r\nsavagery, resulting not only from conflicts between States,\r\nbut also, unfortunately, from ethnic, civil, religious and\r\nother deep-rooted causes within a collapsing State or\r\nStates. This trend, one of the most marked of the post-\r\nwar period, seems to be growing, in the context of an\r\ninternational community that is powerless, disarmed and,\r\nabove all, disillusioned.\r\nAs regards Africa, to which Madagascar belongs, I\r\nrefer in this regard to the genocide in Rwanda, whose\r\nimpact is still felt by international public opinion; the\r\ncontinuation of civil war in Liberia, in Sudan and Angola;\r\nand the spiral of violence and violations of human rights\r\nin Gambia, one of the oldest democracies in West Africa,\r\nfollowing a coup d’état.\r\nOther conflicts still continue in Europe and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nAt the risk of offending some, I must say that most,\r\nif not all, of these hotbeds are fuelled in particular by\r\nsales of illicit weapons — I should rather, say “authorized\r\nsales of weapons”. Their proliferation shows the\r\nineffectiveness of the relevant international conventions\r\nand of the measures enacted by the international\r\ncommunity. They also run counter to the efforts made to\r\nreduce worldwide expenditures on armaments since 1987\r\nin order to obtain the peace dividend.\r\nInternational public opinion was also deeply shocked\r\nby the coup d’état carried out by mercenaries against the\r\nIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros. Madagascar\r\nstrongly condemned that putsch, and congratulates France\r\non the happy outcome of Operation Azalea to re-establish\r\ninstitutional legality in the Comoros.\r\nThe disillusionment that I have described,\r\ndisillusionment bordering on hopelessness, has other\r\naspects which are even more threatening to the world’s\r\nsecurity. Indeed, both in the North and in the South we\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nare witnessing an upsurge of intolerance, of xenophobia —\r\nin brief, of fear or the rejection of difference, of all\r\ndifferences. These feelings are exacerbated by individual\r\nand collective frustrations born of poverty, of\r\nmarginalization and of social injustice. This picture is\r\ncomplemented by environmental degradation, a sluggish\r\neconomy, the depletion of natural resources, the\r\ndisintegration of the social fabric, the spread of drug use,\r\ninternational terrorism, pandemics, natural disasters,\r\nunemployment and famine. To sum up, there is a whole\r\nrange of global threats which are no longer confined within\r\nnational borders.\r\nIt would be a truism to assert that solving these\r\nproblems calls for us to be farsighted, to step back so as to\r\nget a global view and go beyond the outdated approach of\r\nresolving the challenges facing us case by case. That is why\r\nMadagascar must support all the efforts to implement the\r\nglobalizing structural approach in the Agenda for Peace.\r\nHowever, we must recognize that any initiatives in this\r\nfield will be in vain if there continue to be contradictions\r\nbetween the diplomacy of States and the diplomacy of the\r\nUnited Nations, because it is quite obvious that the future\r\nof today’s societies lies within a space that is broadening to\r\nencompass the dimensions of the universe.\r\nThis fundamental refocusing must be the purpose of a\r\nrational reorganization of our organs and institutions, which,\r\ngiven the social, political and economic conditions\r\nprevailing when they were established, now have\r\nlimitations, gaps and shortcomings when it comes to\r\nresponding to the expectations of today’s world.\r\nIn Madagascar’s view, what is needed is, first, to\r\nenlarge the Security Council on the basis of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution in order to ensure the\r\ndemocratization of international relations. Secondly, the\r\nGeneral Assembly must be given greater means, and\r\nespecially more powers, to put an end to the old cliché that\r\nthis organ is merely a forum for rhetoric and orotund\r\nspeechmaking. Thirdly, as indicated in “An Agenda for\r\nPeace,” there must be a considerable strengthening of the\r\nmechanisms for the pacific settlement of disputes set forth\r\nin Chapter VI of the Charter, which would seem in practice\r\nto have become the poor relation of Chapter VII, with its\r\nauthorization of the use of force as a last resort. Indeed, in\r\nthis connection, I would make so bold as to say that any\r\nand all reform of the United Nations must also entail more\r\ncareful attention to the provisions of Chapter VII.\r\nThis strengthening should include giving first\r\npriority in United Nations bodies to the prevention of\r\nviolence by developing a policy and strategy centred on\r\ndevelopment. There, the General Assembly could play a\r\nmore important role, in conjunction with the Security\r\nCouncil, by, for example, in the framework of\r\nre-establishing peace, strengthening the role of United\r\nNations forces used as buffers in international, ethnic or\r\ncivil conflicts. Paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the Charter\r\nexpressly excludes any intervention in matters which are\r\nessentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.\r\nThe settlement of national conflicts, which falls within the\r\ncompetence of the United Nations and which still requires\r\nthe support of the country concerned, must be viewed as\r\nthe carrying out of efforts to establish democracy and the\r\nrule of law and to inculcate a spirit of tolerance and non-\r\nviolence.\r\nThere is also the question of strengthening regional\r\nstructures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, such as\r\nthose that already exist within the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement. Lastly, there is the question of\r\nstrengthening regional cooperation in the sphere of\r\ndisarmament so as to block the uncontrolled movements\r\nof weapons and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Madagascar supported the\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and is about to ratify various\r\ninternational conventions, such as the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\r\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction\r\nand the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the\r\nUse of Certain Conventional Weapons.\r\nIn the economic and social sphere, there is no need\r\nto stress that world development also presents a scenario\r\nof contrasts and disparities, whereas there had been\r\nreason to hope that the post-cold-war period would see a\r\nde facto mobilization of the international community in\r\nsupport of development. Even worse, the outlook is far\r\nfrom encouraging. Poverty and hardship have become\r\nendemic in the so-called fourth world — the “storm\r\nzones”, to use an expression borrowed from the jargon of\r\ntoday’s experts — which is also prey to natural disasters\r\nin addition to its internal problems, resulting from\r\npolitical instability and imbalanced economies. The\r\nbalance of payments continues to show a deficit because\r\nof the crushing burden of external debt and the\r\nfluctuations in the prices of raw materials, accompanied\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nby — to cap it all — a stagnation and even a decline in\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nWe are also witnessing various forms of protectionism\r\nin the countries of the North, while the countries of the\r\nSouth are being urged to liberalize trade. The result is\r\nincreased marginalization of the poor countries, which are\r\nderiving absolutely no benefit from the globalization of the\r\nworld economy, and increased social disparities both\r\nbetween and within nations. That adverse trend is leading\r\nto the formation of an international social apartheid.\r\nIn the United Nations, the establishment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council embodied the poor countries’\r\nhopes for recovery, but it has become clear that its\r\nadministrative machinery is still cumbersome and unsuited\r\nto its task. It has gradually become paralysed by the\r\nmultiplication of its organs, without any real follow-up or\r\ncontrol, and its high operating cost. At last July’s session of\r\nthe Council in Geneva, emphasis was put on the need to\r\ngive it greater vigour by strengthening its competencies and\r\npowers.\r\nIf development is today recognized as a human right,\r\nMadagascar believes that that it is largely thanks to the\r\nUnited Nations, which has advanced the notion of\r\ninterdependence between economic development,\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. Therefore, one of\r\nthe United Nations primary duties is to create and\r\nstrengthen the institutional structure needed to implement\r\nthe norms it has identified for the promotion of\r\ndevelopment. In that connection, Madagascar will\r\nparticipate with attention and interest in the General\r\nAssembly’s debate on An Agenda for Development.\r\nSimilarly, we shall follow with interest the\r\nimplementation of the proposals contained in the\r\nCommuniqué of the G-7 Summit held last June in Halifax,\r\nproposals designed to promote sustainable development and\r\nbetter share the fruits of growth. We welcome the G-7’s\r\nexpress offer to cooperate in formulating a new approach\r\nto international cooperation and in defining the contribution\r\nexpected of the United Nations system, which is seeking\r\nthrough a series of world conferences — recently in\r\nBeijing, previously in Rio, Copenhagen and Vienna, and\r\nnext year in Istanbul — to engage, beyond national borders,\r\nin combined, effective action against poverty,\r\nunemployment and social disintegration. Those conferences\r\nare part of the attempts to renew and improve United\r\nNations methodologies and strategies in the sphere of\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nI cannot fail to refer to the beneficial activities in\r\nMadagascar coordinated by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and carried out through the\r\nUnited Nations system of operational activities and\r\nespecially by the United Nations Children’s Fund. Nor\r\nmust I forget the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization and the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund, whose mid-term review of the third\r\ncountry programme with Madagascar was completed at\r\nthe end of August.\r\nIn the same context we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative on a steering committee to prepare\r\nspecific short-term and medium-term projects for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa in such priority areas as food\r\nsecurity, the strengthening of institutions, the development\r\nof the private sector, desertification and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe viability and survival of our planet depend,\r\nbeyond cooperation, on our ability to adapt to the new\r\nrealities and constraints we face. As we approach 1996,\r\ndeclared by the General Assembly as the International\r\nYear for the Eradication of Poverty, my delegation\r\nwanted today briefly to outline some of the proposals my\r\ncountry is presenting to contribute to making the dreams\r\nof the founding fathers of the Charter come true, although\r\nwe know full well that our proposals are incomplete and\r\nthat even an improved and ideal United Nations would be\r\nunable on its own to solve all the problems before it.\r\nThe building of a better world, to which we all\r\naspire, remains dependent on establishing international\r\nrelations based on the principle of cooperation and\r\nsolidarity and on respect for the principles and norms that\r\ngovern international relations.\r\nIn that connection, let me conclude by noting a great\r\nstep forward in international relations: on the occasion of\r\nthe fortieth anniversary of the Organization, speakers in\r\nthis Hall stressed the concept of the balance of forces in\r\ngeneral and of strategic nuclear parity in particular, while\r\ntoday, 10 years later, we all recognize that security and\r\npeace cannot exist without cooperation and solidarity, and\r\nin the absence of all violence.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI call next on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Yemen, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdulkarim Al-Eryani.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nMr. Al-Eryani (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nPermit me at the outset warmly to congratulate Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session, which\r\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of\r\nthe United Nations. His election to the presidency of this\r\nimportant session reflects special appreciation for his\r\nwell-known diplomatic skills. It also reflects his country’s\r\nrole in and contribution to the international community and\r\nto consolidating its security and stability in line with the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nNor can I fail today warmly to thank His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy for his judicious management of the work\r\nof the General Assembly during its last session, and for his\r\ntireless role in restructuring the United Nations and\r\ndemocratizing its practices.\r\nSimilarly, I should like to reaffirm my country’s\r\nappreciation of the role played by the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and of his indefatigable,\r\ninvaluable work for international peace and security. We\r\nparticularly commend the Secretary-General’s two reports,\r\nthe Agendas for Peace and for Development, which\r\nconstitute central pillars of the new international relations.\r\nThis session takes place half a century after the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. It therefore behoves us to\r\npause for reflection on how the Organization has developed\r\nover the past five decades, for identifying positive and\r\nnegative developments over that period and for working\r\ntowards promoting the positive elements. We must steer the\r\nOrganization in new directions that would spare us the\r\nnegative elements which accompanied the progress of the\r\nOrganization in the past.\r\nProceeding from this, the Republic of Yemen supports\r\nthe efforts aimed at developing the Organization’s\r\nmachineries and principal organs in order for it to be able\r\nto rise to the challenges of the twenty-first century. My\r\ncountry, therefore, welcomes the introduction of structural\r\nreforms, especially with regard to expanding Security\r\nCouncil membership to reflect more accurately the new\r\nrealities and recent changes in international relations, while\r\nobserving the principles of equitable representation and\r\ngeographical distribution and ensuring transparency in the\r\nCouncil’s work. My country is confident that these required\r\nreforms, when introduced, will contribute to the emergence\r\nof new international relationships that would be\r\ncharacterized by right, justice and equality.\r\nThere is no doubt that the international conferences\r\nthe World has witnessed since the end of the cold war on\r\nsocial, environmental and women’s issues, have been\r\nimportant steps taken by the United Nations towards\r\nshaping a new, integrated system with human\r\ndevelopment as its goal, in order to develop a new way\r\nof life, ensure the future of the human race, establish the\r\nfoundations of equitable and sustainable development and\r\nwork towards eliminating the spectres of poverty,\r\nignorance and disease, dangers which continue to threaten\r\nhundreds of millions of the world’s inhabitants.\r\nIn this context, my country wishes to express its\r\nsatisfaction with the work carried out by the Committee\r\non the Indian Ocean to make that region a zone of peace.\r\nWe call upon States members of the Security Council,\r\nmaritime users of the Indian Ocean and littoral countries\r\nto participate in the work of the Committee in view of the\r\npositive contribution it is making towards strengthening\r\npeace, security, stability and cooperation in the region, in\r\nthe light of General Assembly resolutions 48/82 and\r\n49/82.\r\nThere is no doubt that the world at the end of the\r\ntwentieth century is vastly different from what it was in\r\nthe past. Many fundamental concepts of peace,\r\ndevelopment and security are changing, side by side with\r\nthe developments that are taking place in international\r\nrelations. In the light of these changes, everyone is\r\nbecoming increasingly aware that human development\r\nshould become the focus of the activities of the United\r\nNations systems with a view to narrowing the gap\r\nbetween North and South, and to promoting economic and\r\nsocial integration on the basis of the common interests of\r\nStates.\r\nIf any achievement is to be made in this area, we\r\nwill need to rely upon international economic cooperation\r\nin facing up to such international problems as mitigating\r\npoverty and eradicating famine from developing countries,\r\nespecially the least developed among them. In this\r\ncontext, my country calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to commit itself to implementing the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\r\nfor the 1990s, in accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 45/206 of 1990. My country also welcomes the\r\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nand the conclusion of the 1994 GATT agreements, which\r\naim at enhancing integration, promoting equitable\r\ncooperation in trade relations and reducing the intensity\r\nof unfair competition between different societies.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nThe tragic situation of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina has been the focus of the international\r\ncommunity’s attention. It has become clear that\r\ninternational efforts in that region have not succeeded due\r\nto the absence of a genuine desire to put paid to the horrific\r\nmassacring of defenceless civilians in the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs, in open\r\ndefiance of the international will. Therefore, my country\r\nconsiders it imperative that the Security Council should\r\nhasten to lift the weapons embargo in order for the people\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina to be able to exercise the right\r\nof self-defence enshrined in Article 51 of the United\r\nNations Charter. It is not acceptable, in today’s world, that\r\nwe should stand as spectators under whose eyes a\r\ntyrannical minority is allowed to impose by force its will\r\nover the majority’s legitimate rights. While the Republic of\r\nYemen welcomes the peace efforts that are being deployed\r\nwith a view to putting an end to the suffering of the\r\nMuslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it hopes for a\r\nconcerted international effort to find a just solution, which\r\nwould guarantee the freedom, sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nensure the continued provision of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe Middle East has witnessed developments which\r\ncould represent an historical turning-point in the lives of the\r\npeoples of the region, and could thereby reduce the\r\nintensity of hotbeds of tension that threaten international\r\nsecurity and stability. Special mention should be made of\r\nthe positive gains made on the Palestinian-Israeli track,\r\nwhich resulted in the signing in Washington last year of the\r\nAgreement on the transitional period, and the recent Taba\r\nAgreement on the expansion of Palestinian autonomy. My\r\ncountry looks forward to the day when the Palestinian\r\npeople will enjoy their full rights and establish their State\r\non their own territory, with Holy Al-Quds as its capital.\r\nDespite the tangible progress made on the Palestinian and\r\nJordanian tracks, we stress that just and lasting peace will\r\nremain contingent upon complete Israeli withdrawal from\r\nall the occupied Arab territories, particularly the Syrian\r\nGolan and South Lebanon, in accordance with United\r\nNations resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978),\r\nand in line with the principle of land for peace, on the basis\r\nof which the Madrid conference was held in October 1991.\r\nThe civil war in Somalia and the tensions in the Horn\r\nof Africa which have exceeded the bounds of logic and\r\nreason, have caused serious trouble to the neighbouring\r\ncountries, and will cause endless social problems. The\r\nperpetuation of the situation of disruption, confusion and\r\ninfighting in Somalia is a source of grave concern to us all.\r\nGiven Yemen’s Arab, regional and humanitarian\r\nobligations, it has suffered and continues to suffer the\r\nconsequences of the war in Somalia. We have borne the\r\nburden of receiving and accommodating tens of thousands\r\nof refugees, but our ability to continue to do so will\r\ndepend on whether or not the concerted efforts of the\r\ninternational community and the international and regional\r\norganizations will put an end to the suffering of the\r\nSomali people and stop the infighting between the\r\nwarring factions. A solution to this tragic situation must\r\nbe found and what has been destroyed by the war must be\r\nrebuilt, in order for the Somali people to resume a normal\r\nway of life.\r\nMr. Jaddoo (Mauritius), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWhile my country affirms that Iraq should complete\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, and cooperate fully with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to clear up the\r\nproblem of missing persons and prisoners, it reiterates\r\nthat Iraq’s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nshould not be infringed and that there should not be any\r\ninterference in its internal affairs under any pretext.\r\nYemen also repeats its call for the lifting of the economic\r\nsanctions against Iraq, in order to mitigate the suffering\r\nof the Iraqi people. This should be done without any\r\ndevious interpretations of the resolutions of international\r\nlegality and without the imposition of any new conditions\r\nrelating to the nature of the political system, as this is a\r\npurely Iraqi matter that should be decided only the Iraqi\r\npeople themselves. The Republic of Yemen wishes to\r\nexpress its satisfaction with the declaration made by Iraq\r\nto the Security Council, and made during the\r\nOrganization’s Envoy’s recent visits to Iraq, that Iraq is\r\nprepared to cooperate with the international inspection\r\nteam.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen urges the international\r\ncommunity and the Security Council to push for an end\r\nto the air blockade and other measures imposed against\r\nLibya, in response to the resolutions and decisions of the\r\nregional Organization in relation to the dispute, and in\r\nresponse to the positive initiatives calling for dialogue and\r\nnegotiations.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen also renews its appeal to its\r\nbrethren in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United\r\nArab Emirates to reach a peaceful settlement to the\r\nproblem of the three islands — Greater Tunb, Lesser\r\nTunb and Abu Moussa — in accordance with the Charter\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nprinciple of good-neighbourliness and the precepts and\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nThe continued acquisition by the world of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, endangers international security and\r\nstability and obstructs the search for solutions to the\r\nproblems of development. Disarmament and the channelling\r\nof a portion of military expenditure to development must be\r\nas fundamental steps towards the consolidation of\r\ninternational security and stability.\r\nPeace and development are two concomitant essentials\r\nfor the life of man and should lie at the heart of United\r\nNations future activities at the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nIn this context, my country commends the\r\nachievements of the Review and Extension Conference of\r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons in April 1995. However, the success of\r\nthe resolutions adopted by this Conference will depend on\r\nthe extent of commitment by all States to the contents of\r\nthose resolutions, the affirmation of the universal dimension\r\nof the treaty and its full, not its limited implementation on\r\nthe regional level, particularly in the Middle East. That will\r\nstrengthen the legal force of the Treaty, and create the\r\nappropriate climate for the functioning of the institutions\r\nand mechanisms which will play a principal and important\r\nrole in the process of its implementation.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, having achieved reunification\r\non 22 May 1990, and having firmly consolidated the\r\nfoundations of this unity through the triumph of our people\r\nover the separatist conspiracy on 7 July 1994, is now\r\nengaged in strengthening its democratic approach of\r\npolitical pluralism, respect for human rights and freedom of\r\nthe press. Yemen is also engaged in effecting economic\r\nreforms that would enable it to achieve the qualitative\r\ntransformations required by Yemeni Society in the\r\neconomic life of the country, such as restructuring the\r\nnational economy. This will make Yemen a force for peace\r\nand stability in the region, and enable it to contribute more\r\neffectively to the maintenance of international security and\r\nstability.\r\nAs Yemen is one of the least developed countries, and\r\nin view of the damage done to its national economy by the\r\nseparatist attempt, we hope that the international community\r\nwill increase its support and assistance, in order to enable\r\nus to rebuild our social and economic structures and rid\r\nourselves of the effects of the failed attempt.\r\nIn the context of our foreign policy approach of\r\ndialogue and the settlement of problems by peaceful\r\nmeans, my country has resolved its border question with\r\nthe fraternal Sultanate of Oman, and is in the process,\r\nwith the same degree of sincerity and seriousness, of\r\nseeking a settlement to the border problem with the\r\nfraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through the work of\r\njoint committees, on the basis of the principles contained\r\nin the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Holy\r\nMecca on 26 February 1995.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, as a member of the\r\ninternational community, has always performed and will\r\ncontinue to perform its humanitarian role in the\r\nframework of the United Nations. It will spare no effort\r\nin effectively participating with the international\r\ncommunity in working for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Let us then make this\r\nsession a new point of departure, towards the renewal of\r\nthe concepts of inter-State relations, and towards making\r\nour Organization a universal arbiter.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Eritrea,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Petros Solomon.\r\nMr. Solomon (Eritrea): Allow me first to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his election as the\r\nPresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy Government is convinced that the wealth of his\r\nexperience and abilities will prove vital at this crucial\r\ncrossroads as we search for new and innovative\r\nmechanisms and structures to enhance the effectiveness of\r\nour Organization to meet the challenges of the coming\r\ncentury.\r\nAllow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Côte d’Ivoire, for the ability and commitment\r\nthat he showed in presiding over the forty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nWe further wish to express our profound\r\nappreciation of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and to commend him for his untiring\r\nefforts to ensure the effectiveness of our Organization.\r\nThe multifaceted challenges that our global\r\ncommunity will continue to face in the period ahead, and\r\nthe opportunities that exist — more than at any time in\r\nthe past — to promote equity and justice in a more\r\nharmonious world will require a thorough review of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nparadigms, methods and institutions that have functioned\r\nfor the past 50 years. Indeed, different realities from those\r\nnow prevailing inspired the founding of the United Nations\r\nin 1945 and shaped its operational mechanisms in the\r\nsubsequent decades. The situation now is very much\r\nchanged, if not altogether new.\r\nThe membership of the Organization itself has\r\nundergone phenomenal change to increase almost fourfold.\r\nMoreover, while the threat of a major international\r\nconfrontation has receded with the end of the cold war, a\r\nhost of other problems, including an upsurge in inter-State\r\nconflicts, international terrorism, growing poverty and\r\nmarginalization of vast segments of humanity in the\r\ndeveloping countries as well as within affluent societies, are\r\ncoming to the fore. It is apparent that these problems and\r\nrealities will require novel theoretical and institutional\r\napproaches.\r\nIt is in this context that my Government welcomes the\r\ndebates that have been provoked by the recommendations\r\nof the independent working committee and other interested\r\nparties on the future of the United Nations. Let me further\r\nunderline that, as one of the new Member countries of the\r\nUnited Nations, we are gratified to rejoin the world\r\ncommunity of States and impart our views on its future,\r\nespecially as we have had the added advantage of gauging\r\nits operations from without for most of the past 50 years.\r\nWe share the view of many Member States on the\r\nimperative of restructuring the decision-making bodies of\r\nthe United Nations — particularly the Security Council, in\r\na manner that ensures adequate representation of its diverse\r\ncomponents and interests. The process of restructuring\r\nshould not, moreover, consist of mere enlargement through\r\nthe inclusion of a number of potential candidates as\r\npermanent members through some selection criteria of\r\nfinancial and economic clout, population size and other\r\nsimilar factors. As we all agree, the issue is more profound\r\nand transcends a simple numbers game. We hold that\r\nserious thought must be given to devising a suitable\r\narrangement that guarantees the proper representation of our\r\nglobal community in its rich diversity and that is amenable\r\nto periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changes\r\nin a dynamic world.\r\nIn the same vein, we welcome the emerging consensus\r\nover rationalizing the development agencies and institutions\r\nof the United Nations by eliminating overlapping functions\r\nand mandates, and integrating these institutions into more\r\npowerful and authoritative bodies. The numerous platforms\r\nunanimously adopted at the international Summits in Rio,\r\nCairo, Copenhagen and Beijing, aimed at environmental\r\npreservation, the reduction and elimination of poverty,\r\nand the empowerment of women, cannot be realized\r\nwithout the concerted efforts of these enhanced\r\ninstitutions. The new drive towards their increased\r\nintegration is therefore both appropriate and timely.\r\nNone of these ideals can come to fruition without\r\nthe essential prerequisite of peace. Representing a nation\r\nand people that have suffered the agonies of war and\r\nconflict for almost the entire lifetime of this Organization,\r\nmy Government cannot underrate the efforts and priorities\r\nthat the United Nations must accord to the prevention and\r\nresolution of conflicts. Past failures and inadequacies can\r\nonly reinforce the collective resolve of our global\r\ncommunity to check forces of aggression and\r\ndestabilization and not to let down wronged parties.\r\nAnd yet we cannot hide our disappointment at the\r\nindecision and wavering we see over sending clear signals\r\nto defuse potential time-bombs and conflicts that are\r\nbrewing. The age-old folly of arming belligerent and\r\naggressor States in pursuit of narrow commercial and\r\nother mundane interests continues unabated. This\r\nanomalous left-over of the cold-war years must surely be\r\nrectified, as it is the first step that we must take in our\r\nquest for global peace and as we devise elaborate\r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution.\r\nIf I have dwelt somewhat at length on what we\r\naspire to see in the invigorated Organization in the\r\ndecades to come, this is due to my sincere belief that the\r\ntone we set here collectively will have far greater\r\ninfluence in shaping the future of our planet than the\r\nisolated measures and endeavours we undertake in our\r\nindividual countries.\r\nAllow me now, to briefly touch on issues of direct\r\nimportance to my country and our subregion. After three\r\ndecades of agonizing war, my Government is today fully\r\nengaged in healing the wounds of war, rehabilitating a\r\ndevastated country and institutionalizing the rule of law.\r\nThe constitution-drafting process, hinged on popular\r\nparticipation in all its phases, is progressing at a\r\nsatisfactory pace and according to the schedule envisaged.\r\nWe are also doing our utmost to contribute, together\r\nwith our sisterly partners, to the creation of a climate\r\nconducive to subregional cooperation and collective\r\nsecurity on our part of the continent, which has seen\r\nmuch turmoil and commotion in the past. The precarious\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 11 October 1995\r\nsituation in Somalia and the problems posed by the\r\ndestabilizing policies pursued by the National Islamic Front\r\n(NIF) regime in the Sudan only indicate the enormity of the\r\ntasks, which need persistent and concerted efforts by all\r\nregional and international actors concerned.\r\nThe recent document signed in regard to the\r\nimplementation of the second phase of the peace\r\nagreement between the Palestinian and Israeli parties can\r\nonly inspire confidence in all of us that this long-drawn-\r\nout conflict is heading towards a satisfactory resolution at\r\nlong last. We trust that these measures will contribute\r\ntowards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to restate our firm belief and\r\nhopes that our Organization will find the insight and inner\r\nstrength to reinvigorate itself to meet the challenges of the\r\nnext century. I can only reiterate my Government’s firm\r\ncommitment to play its small and modest part to advance\r\nthe ideals that bind us together.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\n18\r\n"
