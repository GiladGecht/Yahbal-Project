I should like to inform\r\nMembers that item 41, entitled “Support by the United\r\nNations system of the efforts of Governments to promote\r\nand consolidate new or restored democracies”, instead of\r\nbeing considered on Tuesday, 31 October 1995, is now\r\nscheduled for consideration on Friday, 10 November 1995.\r\nAdditionally, I should like to announce the tentative\r\nprogramme of plenary meetings for the month of\r\nNovember.\r\nOn Wednesday, 1 November, in the morning, the\r\nAssembly will take up item 14, “Report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency”.

Furthermore, I should like to remind\r\nrepresentatives that the Pledging Conference for\r\nDevelopment Activities will be held in the morning of\r\nWednesday, 1 November, and of Thursday, 2 November.\r\nThe Conference will be opened by the Secretary-General.\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to the\r\n1996 programmes of the United Nations Relief and Works\r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East will take\r\nplace on Thursday, 30 November, in the morning.\r\nThis tentative schedule which I have just announced\r\nwill appear in the Journal and the verbatim record of the\r\nmeeting. Members are aware that there are a number of\r\nitems which have not yet been scheduled. I shall inform the\r\nAssembly as soon as appropriate dates for their\r\nconsideration have been fixed. I shall also keep the\r\nAssembly informed of any changes in the announced\r\nschedule. The tentative programme of work of the\r\nAssembly for November will in due course be circulated in\r\nan addendum to document A/INF/50/5.\r\nI should like to reiterate that I would hope to keep to\r\nthat schedule as closely as possible, so that the Assembly\r\nmay discharge its responsibilities in an orderly fashion.\r\nIn that context, I should like to remind members that\r\ndraft resolutions involving expenditure require more lead\r\ntime in order to allow the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee to review the programme budget implications\r\nbefore the Assembly takes action on such draft resolutions.\r\nBearing in mind also the fact that the financial\r\nconstraints facing the Organization have resulted in\r\nstringent measures concerning Secretariat services, I would\r\nappeal to those representatives wishing to submit draft\r\nresolutions to do so sufficiently in advance for the reasons\r\nI have just mentioned and so that the membership has\r\nadequate time to examine them.\r\nAgenda item 153\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization: draft resolution\r\n(A/50/L.1)\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nTurkmenistan to introduce the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/50/L.1.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Mr. President, please allow me to begin my\r\nstatement by extending to you on behalf of the member\r\nStates of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)\r\nour sincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAs representative of the current Chairman of the\r\nECO Council of Ministers and Chairman of the Contact\r\nGroup of ECO member States at the United Nations, it is\r\nmy proud privilege to address the General Assembly on\r\nan agenda item which is of vital importance to us in the\r\nECO region.\r\nAs representatives are well aware, the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization is a major regional grouping\r\ndevoted to the socioeconomic well-being of its 10\r\nmember States located in a region of special geo-strategic\r\nimportance encompassing more than 7 million square\r\nkilometres and inhabited by nearly 300 million people. In\r\nthis richly endowed region, the ECO is playing a pivotal\r\nrole, not only in the revival and consolidation of the\r\nhistoric, cultural and economic links among our peoples,\r\nbut also in providing access for the newly independent\r\nRepublics of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia and\r\nthe Caucasus to the rest of the world through the\r\nterritories of Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkey.\r\nThese Republics are currently going through a critical\r\nphase of political and economic transformation and need\r\nthe assistance and cooperation of international community,\r\nnot only in the restructuring of their economic systems,\r\nbut also in the consolidation of their political\r\nindependence.\r\nMy own country, Turkmenistan, under the dynamic\r\nleadership of President Niyazov, has opted to pursue a\r\npolicy of positive neutrality, which is enshrined in its\r\nConstitution. It is noteworthy that on 16 March 1995 the\r\nMajlis (Parliament) of Turkmenistan adopted a decree in\r\nwhich the people of Turkmenistan endorsed the principle\r\nof positive neutrality on the part of Turkmenistan as the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nbasis of its foreign policy in full accordance with the\r\ninterests of the State, its prospects for development, the\r\nnational, historical and geographical identity of\r\nTurkmenistan and the mentality of Turkmen people. This\r\npolicy was welcomed by the Heads of State or Government\r\nof ECO member countries on the occasion of the Third\r\nECO Summit Meeting held in Islamabad in March this\r\nyear.\r\nSince then, a number of other countries have\r\nexpressed their support for Turkmenistan’s status of\r\npositive neutrality, which we hope will receive formal\r\nrecognition at the current session of the General Assembly.\r\nMeanwhile, Turkmenistan continues to play a pivotal role\r\nin promoting the ECO as a progressive and outward-looking\r\norganization ready to cooperate with every country and\r\nregion in the world on the basis of mutual benefit.\r\nTurkmenistan will be hosting the next ECO summit\r\nmeeting, in Ashkhabad in April 1996 — a striking\r\nmanifestation of its commitment to the ECO’s goals and\r\nobjectives.\r\nFor its part, the ECO has come a long way in pursuit\r\nof its objectives since its expansion from a tripartite entity\r\ninto a 10-member regional organization three years ago. It\r\nhas adopted two comprehensive plans of action — the\r\nQuetta Plan of Action and the Istanbul Declaration, which\r\ndetermine our long-term perspectives and define sectoral\r\npriorities with concrete targets to be reached by the year\r\n2000. At the heart of these action plans lies the\r\ndevelopment of a modern transport and communications\r\ninfrastructure linking the member States with each other\r\nand with the outside world. A project-oriented outline plan\r\nadopted at Alma-Ata in October 1993 is currently being\r\nimplemented at the national, bilateral and regional levels.\r\nEarly this year Turkmenistan hosted a meeting of the\r\nECO Council of Ministers, in which several regional\r\narrangements were finalized, paving the way for the signing\r\nof final documents on the establishment of important ECO\r\ninstitutions on the occasion of the Third ECO Summit\r\nMeeting, in Islamabad. These institutions include the ECO\r\nTrade and Development Bank, the ECO Reinsurance\r\nCompany, the ECO Shipping Company, ECO Air, the ECO\r\nCultural Institute and the ECO Science Foundation. In\r\naddition, to facilitate greater intraregional commercial\r\ninteraction, two agreements — one on transit trade and the\r\nother on simplification of visa procedures for businessmen\r\nof ECO countries — were signed.\r\nWith this process in place, we are now entering the\r\nphase of implementation of our programmes. To achieve\r\nthe best results, and for the sake of a coordinated pursuit\r\nof our objectives in harmony with global trends, we attach\r\ngreat importance to working closely with other regional\r\nand international organizations, particularly the United\r\nNations and its agencies that are active in the field of\r\nsocial and economic development.\r\nThe United Nations and the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization, working together on the basis of mutual\r\ncooperation, can greatly advance the realization of our\r\ncommon objectives in the ECO region. Substantive\r\ncooperation between the ECO and the United Nations has\r\nalready begun. For example, several joint projects have\r\nbeen developed between the ECO and the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Indeed, some\r\nof these have already been implemented. Likewise, we\r\ncontemplate many joint activities with the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund and\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme. Details of\r\nthese joint efforts of ECO and United Nations agencies\r\ncan be found in the explanatory memorandum relating to\r\nthe draft resolution being considered under this agenda\r\nitem.\r\nWhat we need at this stage is to develop a joint\r\nstrategy for closer cooperation and coordination between\r\nagencies of the ECO and the United Nations with a view\r\nto coordinating activities and optimizing the opportunities\r\noffered by the vast human and material resources of the\r\nECO region. Adoption of the draft resolution and\r\ninclusion of the question of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization as a regular item on the agenda of General\r\nAssembly sessions would indeed be a step in the right\r\ndirection and would establish a reliable mechanism for\r\nmonitoring the progress in that cooperation in the years\r\nahead.\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, the countries\r\nsponsoring this draft resolution believe that it will have\r\nno budgetary implications for the United Nations.\r\nFinally, I should like, on behalf of the countries of\r\nthe ECO, to thank His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, the Secretary-General, for his support and\r\ncooperation in promoting our common aims and economic\r\ndevelopment objectives in the ECO region. We hope that\r\nin our future joint action he will, likewise, take all the\r\nnecessary measures to establish close liaison between the\r\ntwo organizations, as well as to determine new areas of\r\ncollaboration, in keeping with the needs and resources of\r\nour region.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nWe wish the General Assembly every success in its\r\ndeliberations on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/2 of 13 October 1993, I now call on the\r\nSecretary-General of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Secretary-General of the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization): I should like, at the outset, to\r\nextend to you, Sir, my sincere felicitations on your\r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at this historic fiftieth anniversary session.\r\nI should like also to express our special thanks and\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, for his dedicated efforts to promote the aims and\r\nobjectives of the United Nations and its cooperation with\r\nregional organizations, including the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO), which I am privileged to be\r\nrepresenting today in this forum.\r\nThe ECO is a purely economic organization seeking\r\nto promote multifaceted regional cooperation with a view\r\nto accelerating the socio-economic well-being of its\r\nmember States. It comprises 10 States, including — besides\r\nAfghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey — six newly\r\nindependent Republics of the former Soviet Union. These\r\nRepublics are currently engaged in consolidating the fruits\r\nof their political and economic independence through\r\nmarket-oriented structural reforms and security-related\r\nmutual confidence-building measures. One of them —\r\nTurkmenistan — is even espousing a policy of positive\r\nneutrality. They surely need the full support of the\r\ninternational community for their endeavours — particularly\r\nin terms of liberal foreign investment and market-access\r\nopportunities.\r\nThe ECO, for its part, is giving these Republics a\r\nhelping hand, not only by facilitating the smooth transition\r\nof their economies but also by providing them with\r\ninfrastructural links with the rest of the world through the\r\nroad, railway and shipping networks of Afghanistan, Iran,\r\nPakistan and Turkey.\r\nWithin the first three years of its expansion in 1992,\r\nthe ECO has embarked upon a comprehensive cooperation\r\nprogramme based on two important plans of action — the\r\nQuetta Plan of Action and the Istanbul Declaration, both\r\nrepresenting a comprehensive blueprint of our socio-\r\neconomic development strategy, with special focus on\r\ntransport and communications, trade and investment and\r\nenergy as priority areas.\r\nTo best accomplish its objectives, the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization attaches the utmost importance\r\nto its cooperative relationship with the United Nations and\r\nits agencies, particularly those engaged in the socio-\r\neconomic development activities of our region. Two years\r\nback, on the eve of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly, the ECO acquired observer status with the\r\nUnited Nations. Since then, several major United Nations\r\nagencies have shown interest in ECO activities and are\r\nco-sponsoring some of its projects. These agencies\r\ninclude the Economic and Social Commission for Asia\r\nand the Pacific (ESCAP), the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO), the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), with which\r\nthe ECO has already established institutionalized\r\ncooperative relationships.\r\nIn view of the growing trend towards interregional\r\ncooperation, the ECO is also pursuing an annual\r\nconsultative process with Asia’s major subregional\r\norganizations — namely, the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) and the South Pacific\r\nForum. Similarly, contacts have also been established\r\nwith the European Union, with both sides seeking to\r\nidentify a mutually acceptable framework and possible\r\nareas of cooperation.\r\nFor us it is indeed heartening that the General\r\nAssembly is considering this important agenda item on\r\ncooperation between the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization and the United Nations. We look forward to\r\nthe unanimous adoption of draft resolution A/50/L.1,\r\nwhich envisages specific measures for strengthening\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization, including the\r\nestablishment of a regular consultative and monitoring\r\nframework, and calls for a report on the subject to be\r\nsubmitted for the General Assembly’s consideration at its\r\nfifty-first session.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish every success for this\r\nsession, which, coinciding as it does with the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, must revive the hope\r\nand confidence of the international community in the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nideals of peace, development and social progress throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nThe President: There are no other speakers on this\r\nitem.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.1.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.1 was adopted (resolution\r\n50/1).\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 153?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice (A/50/4)\r\nThe President: The report of the International Court\r\nof Justice now before the Assembly (A/50/4) covers the\r\nperiod from 1 August 1994 to 31 July 1995.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui,\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Bedjaoui (President of the International Court of\r\nJustice) (interpretation from French): I am sure that\r\nPortugal, its wealth of intelligent citizens notwithstanding,\r\nwas not long in doubt as to the choice of a politician to be\r\nput forward for election by the nations of the world to the\r\noffice of President of the General Assembly. Beyond your\r\nqualifications, Mr. President, as Prime Minister, Minister or\r\nHead of a democratic party — posts that you have occupied\r\nor still occupy — I am sure it was your standing as an\r\nacademic, intellectual and man of culture that first and\r\nforemost determined that choice.\r\nThe international community is honoured to welcome\r\nyou — a man of political action, of course, but also a\r\nthinker and a humanist whose life has been marked by\r\ngenerous choices in the service of justice and progress —\r\nas steward of the loftiest Assembly in the world. I would\r\nalso like to say how delighted the International Court of\r\nJustice was to learn that an eminent professor of public\r\nlaw had been placed at the head of the Assembly.\r\nMoreover, how could the Court not rejoice in your\r\nelection when, in an unprecedented gesture, in your very\r\nfirst statement as President on 19 September last, you\r\nmade a point of placing the work of the United Nations\r\nunder the banner of the primacy of international law and\r\npaying tribute to the Court as one of the principal organs\r\nof the United Nations, dedicated specifically to the\r\npromotion of respect for that branch of law that you have\r\nnever stopped teaching to and inculcating in new\r\ngenerations? The Court cannot fail to express its\r\ngratitude, through me, when you have issued such a lofty\r\nappeal to all States to accept the jurisdiction of our Court.\r\nYou are presiding over the Assembly of the peoples\r\nof the United Nations at an exceptional moment in its\r\nexistence: its admirable fiftieth anniversary. I am sure that\r\nyou will lead the commemoration with all the wisdom\r\nand mastery that we expect. I offer you my warmest\r\nwishes for the complete success of this exalted task that\r\nis made to your measure.\r\nGiving the floor to the President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice when the Court’s report is under\r\nconsideration has become a tradition that the General\r\nAssembly has accepted with good grace for some years\r\nnow. To me, this gesture seems to have symbolic value.\r\nIn this year in which we are commemorating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, I would like to lay\r\nparticular emphasis upon the extremely special nature of\r\nthis regular contact, an exemplary expression of the close\r\ncollaboration that should unite the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations as they strive to attain the purposes of the\r\nOrganization. However, it is also striking testimony to the\r\ninterest that the General Assembly — and through it, the\r\nentire international community — takes in the activities\r\nof the Court. Accordingly, I am pleased to thank the\r\nGeneral Assembly deeply for again being so good as to\r\ndevote a few minutes of its precious time to listening to\r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice.\r\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations — and the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice in a few months’ time —\r\nprovides me with an opportunity to share with the\r\nAssembly, and with each of the States represented here,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nsome thoughts on the current role and on the future of the\r\nprincipal judicial organ that I have the honour to represent.\r\nWhen confronted by the large number of conflicts in\r\nthe world of today that fall outside the jurisdiction of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, the general public is\r\nfrequently led to wonder: exactly what is an international\r\njudge supposed to do?\r\nTo wonder about the role and the future of permanent\r\ninternational justice is to try to find a proper answer to that\r\nkind of question. It is to wonder how the “scales of justice”\r\ncan operate and extend their influence when not backed up\r\nby a powerful “sword” — if I may transpose into the\r\ninternational sphere the familiar thought patterns of the\r\nmunicipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy —\r\nso dear to Montesquieu — of legislative, executive and\r\njudicial powers. One is once again led to wonder whether,\r\ngiven the requirements of the municipal “model”, one can\r\nreally conceive, in the international order, of a judicial\r\npower in an international community whose real existence\r\nis a matter of some doubt in certain quarters and in which\r\nthere is, moreover, neither an authentic legislature nor any\r\nreal power of enforcement.\r\nOne could go on asking questions of this kind until\r\none reached the point of paradox, such are the difficulties\r\ninvolved in resolving the mystery surrounding the future of\r\ninternational justice. Indeed, the International Court of\r\nJustice, as the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations, is no more than one part of a whole, a mere\r\ncog — albeit an important cog — in a complex mechanism\r\nconceived in accordance with a set of precise specifications.\r\nOne might properly be led to think that the future of that\r\norgan naturally depends upon the future of the United\r\nNations. That is obviously a sensible line of argument but\r\nnone the less it implies a simplification which has to be\r\nmoderated in the light of the point I would now like to\r\nmake. It would seem that the current situation of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice is characterized by a certain\r\nsingularity — I would even say a certain paradox. This\r\nrelates to the good fortune currently attending the Court at\r\nthe very same time as the mother Organization as a whole\r\nis confronting considerable difficulties on a variety of\r\nfronts.\r\nThe world legislative power exists only in outline\r\nform. It is represented by this distinguished Assembly,\r\nwhich is strengthened by its composition representing as it\r\ndoes all the peoples of the United Nations, but which can\r\nonly legislate by means of resolutions that are not, as a\r\ngeneral rule, legally binding. As for the Security Council,\r\nwhich is constitutionally free from any such limitation, it\r\nmay doubtless be compared to a quasi-world executive\r\npower but, as it has scarcely recovered from the paralysis\r\nto which it was long condemned by the cold war, it is\r\ncurrently experiencing new difficulties in maintaining and\r\nconsolidating international peace and security. However,\r\nit is in this context of the laborious building of the\r\nproclaimed new world order that States, and even national\r\npublic opinion, are turning to the Court in a singular but\r\nencouraging trend.\r\nNow that we are engaged in a stock-taking exercise,\r\nthe Court’s stock seems at present to be in better shape\r\nthan that of some others. It would seem that the judicial\r\nfunction may — on an international level as well — lay\r\nclaim to a necessary measure of autonomy and\r\nindependence. When the founding fathers of the 1945\r\nCharter forged close structural links between the Court\r\nand the United Nations, they obviously intended that the\r\nCourt should be fully integrated into the new system for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been\r\ndevised, but they did not in any way wish to deprive the\r\nCourt of the autonomy indispensable to the sound\r\nadministration of justice. In that regard, they refrained\r\nfrom making any fundamental changes in the situation\r\nbrought into being by their predecessors at the League of\r\nNations with respect to the former Permanent Court.\r\nIt would however be unforgivably imprudent — if\r\nnot totally disproportionate — to claim to be able to\r\npredict a separate future for the United Nations and for\r\nthe Court, as their mutual and indissociable fate remains\r\nsealed by the Charter, that Magna Carta of mankind.\r\nFor the time being, and to be more cautious, my aim\r\nis to look briefly at the Court’s current good fortune and\r\nto explore the reasons for it. I shall then consider the\r\nimprovements that could well be made to a judicial\r\ninstitution that will soon be 50 years old, to enable it to\r\nmeet the new and numerous challenges with which it is\r\nconfronted.\r\nAs I have just said, the International Court of Justice\r\nhas been thriving for the past few years. Never before has\r\nit been so much in demand, never before has it been so\r\nactive. There seems to be every indication that that\r\ntendency will only grow stronger in the years to come.\r\nIndeed, certain profound changes that have come\r\nabout in the international community and, more\r\nparticularly, by the end of a world divided into two camps\r\nas a result of the cold war are still too recent to have\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nbeen able to have their full positive effect upon\r\ninternational judicial settlement. This new period was\r\nushered in by a momentous event, the fall of the Berlin\r\nWall — on a memorable day in November 1989. However\r\nit does seem that on all sides, other walls which have been\r\nerected in the minds of some of the world’s leaders and\r\nwhich previously constituted so many additional\r\nimpediments to the work of the Court are now also\r\nbeginning to fall — to such an extent that the States parties\r\nto the 10 contentious cases now on the Court’s general list\r\nare located on every continent.\r\nThe International Court of Justice is currently\r\ndisplaying unprecedented vitality. In line with the unusual\r\nnumber of cases of which it is seized, the Court has seen its\r\njurisdiction steadily expand, both in terms of the number of\r\ndeclarations made and in terms of the compromissory\r\nclauses included in treaties — or in terms of the withdrawal\r\nof reservations to such clauses. Moreover, the Court’s\r\ncurrent vitality is not to be measured merely by the\r\nyardstick of the confidence currently placed in it by States;\r\nit must also be assessed in accordance with the way in\r\nwhich States comply with its decisions.\r\nBut what is the source of the Court’s new vitality?\r\nReferences have been made in turn, and with a greater\r\nor lesser degree of relevance, to the decisions reached by\r\nthe Court in certain cases, to the end of communism, the\r\ngreater trust placed in the Court by third world countries,\r\nand a more widespread psychological rallying to the\r\napplicable international law.\r\nI must stress that the Court’s success has not derived\r\nfrom the “transactional justice” or “compromise justice”\r\nwhich has sometimes been ascribed to it. It is of course true\r\nto say that, in certain cases, the seizing of the Court has\r\nbeen no more than a means of pressure exercised by one\r\nparty upon another in a bid to lead it to a political\r\nsettlement, seen as preferable to a judicial decision.\r\nUnder such circumstances, the Court, fully aware of\r\nits responsibilities as an integral part of the system of\r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes established\r\nunder the Charter, has displayed judicial realism and has\r\nconsidered itself obligated to assist in bringing the parties\r\ncloser together, while not at any time departing from its\r\nprimary task of applying the law. However that in no way\r\nmeans that the Court hands down “judgments of Solomon”.\r\nFar from it. It goes without saying that it has never tried to\r\ndo anybody any favours; nor has it ever compromised the\r\nintegrity of its judicial function or the principles governing\r\nits mission. Its strength, and doubtless its success, will\r\nhave been that it knows how to do justice with full legal\r\nrectitude, with full intellectual honesty and in a spirit of\r\ntotal independence, but, for all that, without shutting itself\r\naway in an ivory tower or failing to take account of the\r\nfacts of life.\r\nThe vitality of the Court can be explained. The\r\nInternational Court of Justice ultimately has the strengths\r\nof its weaknesses — or, if you prefer, the virtue of its\r\nprincipal vice. The international judicial function still\r\nbears the image of the international society whose\r\ndisputes it is called upon to settle: it operates on a\r\nconsensual basis. The success of the Court may well be\r\ndue precisely to the fact that its role seems ultimately to\r\nbe fairly well adapted to the concerns and the system of\r\nvalues predominating in the States to which it is open.\r\nHas not consensualism become, more than ever, a value\r\nin which to take refuge in a society of States that is still\r\nresistant to the advances of supranationalism?\r\nOf course, States may undertake in advance to\r\naccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, thus\r\ngiving it what may be described as a free hand, just as\r\nthey give a free hand to the Security Council when they\r\naccede to the Charter. However, such a comparison\r\nimmediately requires one to relativize, in so far as the\r\nabandonment of sovereignty conceded in each case is not\r\ndone under identical conditions, or with identical\r\nconsequences. There can be said to be a far greater\r\nexercise of free will in a State’s decision to accept the\r\njurisdiction of the Court than in a decision to submit to\r\nthe decisions of the Security Council.\r\nAnother partial reason for the present good fortune\r\nof the Court might be found in a wider context, that of\r\nthe general development of international relations. It\r\nwould appear to be a truth borne out by experience that\r\nlegal settlement is more widely supported, and even more\r\nsought after, when the international atmosphere is less\r\ntense. The counterpart proof is provided by the fact that\r\nit was during the periods of extreme international tension\r\nin the cold war that the Court was bereft of cases and\r\ncould not perform its function. Moreover, is it not true to\r\nsay that tension per se, without any clearly defined object,\r\ngenerally prevented the emergence of specific legal\r\ndisputes, which are the only ones appropriate for\r\nsubmission to the Court?\r\nHowever, this argument must be treated with\r\ncaution, for it is no secret that the disappearance of the\r\nbipolar international order has not resulted in the creation\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nof a peaceful world, since the world of freedom which has\r\nsucceeded it is also more fragmented and uncertain.\r\nBe that as it may, if it is to guarantee its future, the\r\nCourt needs new means to enable it to meet the new\r\nchallenges with which it will be confronted in the coming\r\nyears.\r\nBefore briefly outlining some of these means, let me\r\nmake two introductory observations, which seem to me as\r\nself-evident as they are fundamental and which seem also\r\nto govern the future direction of the Court. The first is that,\r\nalthough the Charter brought about progress for permanent\r\ninternational jurisdiction, that progress was not as decisive\r\nin this field as it was, for example, in the political sphere.\r\nWith the major changes that occurred on the world stage\r\nafter the Second World War and the outlawing of the use\r\nof force, the overall profile of the political organs of the\r\nUnited Nations and the links and relations between these\r\norgans have been fundamentally reshaped and streamlined.\r\nOn the other hand, the judicial organ, the International\r\nCourt of Justice, has, barring a few details, virtually\r\nremained a replica or a continuation of the Permanent Court\r\nof International Justice. In other words, from the League of\r\nNations to the United Nations, the political organs would\r\nappear to have matured more than the judicial organ,\r\nwhich, 73 years after its birth, remains essentially the same.\r\nMy second introductory observation concerns the new\r\nfunctions and powers that have been granted to the United\r\nNations and to many other international organizations since\r\n1945. It cannot be claimed today, in 1995, that the world\r\nOrganization plays the same role, is vested with the same\r\nmission and has the same legal status as its predecessor in\r\nthe 1920s. Still more, at a time when international\r\norganizations have more legal means at their disposal —\r\nwhich, admittedly, they do not always use — in order to\r\nbecome full players in international relations, the State,\r\ntraditionally the exclusive subject of these international\r\nrelations, is undergoing internal and international changes\r\nwhich affect this traditional role of solo player.\r\nIt is clear that these new situations create new needs\r\nand that the future of the International Court of Justice will\r\nbe measured by its ability to win a status which is not\r\nsimply a replica of the status of the former Permanent\r\nCourt of International Justice. There can be no doubt that\r\nadjustments are necessary.\r\nThese adjustments must first of all be made to the\r\ncontentious function of the Court. The Court’s jurisdiction\r\nratione personae has remained frozen, as it were, since\r\n1922. The Court is open only to States. Today, when\r\nintergovernmental organizations have grown up, it is\r\nimportant to give them access to contentious procedure.\r\nStates, subjects traditionally described as primary or\r\nnecessary components of the international legal order, are\r\nin reality no longer the only players in international\r\nrelations or the only interlocutors where peace-keeping is\r\nconcerned. International life shows us every single day\r\nthat at this level greater account must be taken of other\r\nentities, notably the international organizations. Access to\r\nthe Court’s contentious procedure, currently reserved for\r\nStates alone, may therefore now seem too narrow. Among\r\nthe remedies found for these shortcomings has been the\r\nincorporation into certain treaties, with which members\r\nwill be familiar, of ad hoc clauses laying down that, in\r\nthe event of a dispute between the international\r\norganization and the States specified therein, that\r\norganization will request the Court for an advisory\r\nopinion, which the two parties agree will have a decisive\r\nor binding effect. The technique referred to as that of\r\ncompulsory advisory opinions, whose very name\r\nunderlines its singularity, is, however, no more than a\r\nstopgap which cannot be a substitute for full access by\r\norganizations with international legal personality to the\r\ncontentious procedure of the Court.\r\nOn the other hand, it would not seem that, where the\r\nCourt’s jurisdiction rationae materiae in the context of\r\ncontentious procedure is concerned, there are any\r\nmeasures to be taken with a view to increasing accession\r\nto the optional clause of compulsory jurisdiction. To date,\r\n59 States have acceded to the clause; this number,\r\ncompared with the total number of Member States of the\r\nOrganization, represents a ratio of one third, which has\r\nnot appreciably changed since 1945. I fear that this ratio\r\ncannot be significantly improved, unless, of course, there\r\nis a spectacular momentum in international relations.\r\nWhen President Mikhail Gorbachev called upon the five\r\npermanent member States of the Security Council to set\r\nan example by submitting their disputes to the\r\nInternational Court, this aroused great interest, which,\r\nregrettably, quickly waned. The five members held a\r\nnumber of meetings at the legal adviser level with a view\r\nto drawing up a list of subjects which the Court would be\r\nlikely to entertain in the event of a dispute. But no\r\nagreement was reached.\r\nThis is, after all, the natural and inevitable\r\nconsequence of the conception of international relations\r\nwhich still prevails today. States remain legitimately\r\nattached to the political and diplomatic freedom available\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nto them to settle their disputes in line with their own\r\ninterests and prevailing circumstances. All they want is to\r\nsee all existing procedures relating to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes open to them. And this, after all, is\r\nwhat counts.\r\nMoreover, since every case has its political aspects\r\nand its legal aspects, it is difficult a priori to ask States to\r\ndraw a distinction, in general and definitive terms, between\r\ncases which it would be desirable to submit to the Court\r\nand those which it would be appropriate to settle by other\r\npeaceful means. It is the States which must choose. This is\r\nwhy it seems so rash to try and predict which categories of\r\ncases could be submitted to the Court in the future.\r\nThe desire for the International Court of Justice to be\r\nbetter known by all, so that it can be better utilized and\r\nplay a greater role in the daily life of ministeries and\r\ninternational organizations, has often been expressed. To\r\nthis end, some jurists have suggested that it should be\r\nseized of small cases, whose rapid settlement would enable\r\nit to become part of the mechanics of international relations\r\nin the everyday life of peoples. This is an interesting idea,\r\nbut it is, in fact, an unrealistic one; States and international\r\norganizations cannot contemplate mobilizing the heavy and\r\ncomplex procedural apparatus of the International Court of\r\nJustice for small cases, nor expose themselves to expenses\r\nwhich would seem substantial for such modest issues.\r\nOther jurists have contended, on the contrary, that it\r\nwould rather tend to be cases of moderate importance\r\nwhich would, by nature, be suitable for submission to the\r\nCourt, such as, for example, the existence, the scope or the\r\nlimits of States’ rights of jurisdiction, in particular where\r\nland borders or maritime delimitations are concerned.\r\nIn reality, all these approaches, however ingenious\r\nthey may be, are not part of the political will of States,\r\nwhich remains the only objective determining factor of the\r\nCourt’s activity. Today, the Court is not seized of minor\r\nissues, nor is it seized only of disputes of moderate\r\nimportance. On the contrary, it is seized of a series of vital\r\nissues ranging from the application of the Convention on\r\nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\r\nto the lawfulness of the use of nuclear weapons, a question\r\nwith which this Assembly is very familiar.\r\nAs regards the advisory jurisdiction of the Court, it\r\nseems that thought should also be given to widening its\r\nfield of application ratione personae. The Secretariat,\r\nrepresented by the Secretary-General, is to date — and I\r\nhave stated this on other occasions — the only principal\r\norgan of the United Nations not authorized to request an\r\nadvisory opinion of the Court on any legal question\r\nrelated to its activity in the service of the Organization.\r\nA broadening of the group of international\r\norganizations authorized to request opinions might also\r\nusefully be considered, admitting certain organizations\r\nthat do not fall within the present definition in the\r\nCharter, but whose access to the advisory procedure\r\nwould be desirable for various reasons. The authorization\r\nof access to this procedure might also be extended to\r\ninclude intergovernmental organizations with a more or\r\nless universal status, such as the World Trade\r\nOrganization or the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons, and regional intergovernmental\r\norganizations that work for the maintenance of peace.\r\nLastly, the question of the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the Court’s advisory\r\nprocedure should be given serious study. Those\r\norganizations are today important bodies representing\r\nworld public opinion. Many of them enjoy permanent\r\nconsultative status with the principal organs of the United\r\nNations. They may now have access to the Security\r\nCouncil or the General Assembly. But this is not the case\r\nof the Court.\r\nIn conclusion, the future of the International Court\r\nof Justice depends on many factors which, to a large\r\nextent, elude the control of the Court itself. These\r\ninclude: first, the emergence of certain categories of\r\nconflicts which are called internal but which have clear\r\ninternational repercussions, and which international law\r\ndoes not yet cover except in a very fragmentary fashion;\r\nsecondly, internal and external changes in States which\r\naffect their traditional role as key players in international\r\nrelations; thirdly, the emergence of international\r\nintergovernmental organizations on the world stage,\r\nincluding with respect to judicial settlement; fourthly, the\r\ngrowing place of non-governmental organizations, voicing\r\nthe wishes of an international public opinion more\r\nconcerned with and motivated by world affairs; and, last\r\nbut not least, recognition of the essential role that the\r\nCourt must play in sanctioning a form of international law\r\ngoverning a world and a society of law.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I would\r\nlike to tell the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice and all the members of the Assembly that I will\r\ndo everything in my power to respond, in carrying out my\r\nduties, to the lofty and demanding portrait which he has\r\npresented of me.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe pleasure that any jurist or practitioner of international\r\nrelations feels at learning of the activities of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice is, to my mind, for many\r\nreasons all the greater when the report of the Court is\r\npresented by President Mohammed Bedjaoui, who instils\r\ninto it such faith, conviction and commitment, and delivers\r\nit with outstanding eloquence. The delegation of Algeria is\r\nvery pleased to extend a warm welcome to the Assembly to\r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice, to the\r\ndistinguished judges accompanying him, and to the\r\nRegistrar, Mr. Eduardo Valencia-Ospina. It appreciates the\r\nopportunity for the General Assembly to assess, year after\r\nyear, the assertion of the Court’s authority and the\r\nstrengthening of its role, for the greater good of the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, whose name, renown and\r\nwork are intimately linked with the noble objective of\r\nstrengthening the rule of law based on justice and equity,\r\nhas shared with the Assembly his exemplary reflections,\r\nwhich will naturally find their proper place in the plans\r\nbeing developed by Member States with a view to\r\nlaunching the United Nations into the next century with the\r\ncertainty of a future that is brighter than the tumultuous\r\npast 50 years of its existence.\r\nWhen we think of the past, we remember with\r\nemotion all the jurists who never gave up hope of blazing\r\na pathway for international law through the minefields of\r\nrelations based on force and power politics. Among them,\r\nI wish to mention Judges Nicolaï Tarassov, Roberto Ago\r\nand José María Ruda, who died recently and who will\r\nalways be remembered and honoured by the community of\r\njurists for their erudition, conscience, honesty and open\r\nminds.\r\nThe recent election of Mrs. Rosalyn Higgins as a\r\njudge on the Court is a very hopeful sign that by\r\nwelcoming this great advocate of the rights of peoples and\r\nof human rights, along with judges Vereshchetin and Ferrari\r\nBravo, the Court will be able to tap its full potential.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that among the cold war’s\r\nmany, even damaging, effects, impeding friendship and\r\nharmony among nations, was the adverse effect it had on\r\nthe promotion of international justice and the very\r\nperception long held by States of the capacity and\r\nlimitations of the Court in terms of regulating international\r\nrelations in a judicial capacity. It is true that certain terms\r\nused in the very Statute of the Court to describe a given\r\nsource of law, as well as certain aberrations in case law,\r\nwere enough to sow doubts as to the Court’s readiness to\r\npick up the deep pulsations of today’s international\r\nsociety, even though advisory opinions and far-reaching\r\nrulings have proved full well that the International Court\r\nof Justice had, on many an occasion, been able to go\r\nbeyond the political situation and to demonstrate its strict\r\nobservance of the requirements of justice and law.\r\nToday, when the international political situation\r\nopens up vast prospects for frequent recourse to the\r\njurisdiction of the Court, anachronisms, conservative\r\ntendencies and all kinds of interests unfortunately prevent\r\nthe total flourishing of an international judicial order\r\nbinding on all, beginning with the most powerful among\r\nus.\r\nBut, along with the jurisdiction of the Court in\r\ncontentious cases, a jurisdiction whose extension and\r\nexpansion depend on individual sovereignties, there is\r\nenormous potential for turning to the Court for advice,\r\nbut the principal competent United Nations organs have\r\nnot always made full use of this. From this viewpoint, the\r\ndiscussions now under way with regard to the reform of\r\nthe Security Council will not be sufficiently coherent or\r\nexhaustive unless and until they take fully into account\r\nthe untapped and unexplored resources inherent in\r\nconstitutional control by the International Court of Justice\r\nof the Council’s acts. Besides, action by the Court may\r\nalso prove to make a substantial contribution to a large-\r\nscale effort at preventive diplomacy.\r\nOn this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, all\r\nlegitimate ambition as regards the strengthening of the\r\nfabric of international cooperation for peace and\r\ndevelopment or the strengthening of the system for\r\ncollective security and the peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational disputes must involve the International Court\r\nof Justice. At the same time, the General Assembly must\r\nalways be solicitous of this principal organ when it comes\r\nto preserving the dignity of eminent international judges\r\nand their staff and when human and material resources\r\nare required to enhance the efficacy of this institution and\r\nto promote good and diligent administration of\r\ninternational justice.\r\nMr. Yoogalingam (Malaysia): My delegation would\r\nlike to thank the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice for presenting the report of the Court for the\r\nperiod 1 August 1994 to 31 July 1995. In studying the\r\nreport, my delegation notes that its composition and\r\nstructure are similar to those of last year’s report.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nWe congratulate the President of the International\r\nCourt of Justice for his excellent exposé, in his introduction\r\nof the annual report, of the issues facing the Court. The\r\ninternational community is truly fortunate to have a jurist\r\nof such eminence presiding over the Court. My delegation\r\nalso wishes to take this opportunity to express our sincere\r\ncondolences to the families of the late Judges Nicolaï\r\nTarassov and Roberto Ago, former Judge and President\r\nJosé María Ruda, and former Judge ad hoc, Mrs. Suzanne\r\nBastid. Their meritorious service during their terms of\r\noffice will always be remembered and appreciated.\r\nSimilarly, we wish to express our congratulations to Sir\r\nRobert Jennings on his long, dedicated and exemplary\r\nservice. To the newly elected judges, Vladlen Vereshchetin,\r\nLuigi Ferrari Bravo and Rosalyn Higgins, we extend our\r\ncongratulations.\r\nAs the United Nations commemorates its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, it has become increasingly clear that the\r\nmultilateral system needs to be reformed. This has been\r\nreflected in the statements made by our leaders in this\r\nAssembly in the last two weeks. In this context, there is an\r\nobvious need for a review of the role and composition of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, given its fundamental\r\nimportance as the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation notes that there has been increasing\r\nrecourse to the Court by Member States over the years.\r\nThis is a positive sign and augurs well for the future of the\r\nCourt. The International Court of Justice has an important\r\nrole to play in the promotion of peace and harmony among\r\nthe nations and peoples of the world. The processes\r\nprovided for under the Statute of the International Court of\r\nJustice advance the rule and role of international law.\r\nHowever, much still remains to be done before full respect\r\nfor international law is achieved.\r\nWhile we have always expressed our confidence in the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, my delegation is of the belief\r\nthat it has yet to realize its full potential. Article 96 of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations provides that the General\r\nAssembly or the Security Council may request the Court to\r\ngive an advisory opinion on any legal question. We would\r\nlike to see greater use made by the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council of the Court as a source for advisory\r\nopinion. In addition, the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil not only should utilize the Court as a source of\r\ninterpretation of the relevant applicable law, but should also\r\nrefer controversial decisions to the Court for review.\r\nThe Security Council was established as a principal\r\norgan of the United Nations. The International Court of\r\nJustice was established as another principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations. There are undoubted linkages between the\r\nSecurity Council and the International Court of Justice.\r\nBoth these organs, with their important tasks, should be\r\nrepresentative of today’s global community. As we\r\ncontinue with our efforts to reform and restructure the\r\nSecurity Council, it is equally pertinent to review the\r\ncomposition of the International Court of Justice.\r\nFor my delegation, the views expressed by some\r\nmembers that the rights, status and prerogatives of the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council cannot be\r\naltered are inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter.\r\nThe fact that some of the permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council should seek to assume similar rights in\r\nother organizations of the United Nations is even more\r\nunacceptable, considering that there are no provisions to\r\nthis effect in the Charter.\r\nIt is vital that the role and composition of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice be carefully considered\r\nwithin the context of the review and reform of global\r\ninstitutions. We should benefit from the current collective\r\ndesire to reform and revitalize these institutions, including\r\nthe International Court of Justice. A revitalized\r\nInternational Court of Justice can play its role more\r\neffectively in the advancement of international law and\r\njustice.\r\nMr. De La Pedraja (Mexico) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation expresses its thanks to the\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice,\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, for his lucid presentation of\r\nthe report of the Court. We are grateful for the high\r\nquality of his comments. They undoubtedly enrich the\r\nwork of this session.\r\nWe heard with deep sorrow the news of the death of\r\nJudges Nikolaï Tarassov, Roberto Ago and José María\r\nRuda, as well as that of Professor Suzanne Bastid. They\r\nwere outstanding jurists who contributed with talent and\r\nhard work to the cause of international law. We pay\r\ntribute to their memory.\r\nThe judges elected to fill the vacancies on the Court\r\nduring the period covered by the report, Vladlen\r\nVereshchetin, Luigi Ferrari Bravo and Rosalyn Higgins,\r\nconfirm the excellence of the composition of our principal\r\njudicial organ. In particular, we express our satisfaction at\r\nthe election of Rosalyn Higgins, the first woman who is\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\na permanent member of the Court. We hope that the\r\ninternational community’s objective of seeing a larger\r\nnumber of women in international judicial organs will make\r\nfurther headway in the future.\r\nThe presentation of the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice before the General Assembly is of vital\r\nimportance. Indeed, in recent years Mexico has stressed the\r\nneed for the members of the Assembly to reflect on its\r\nimportance. This exercise gives Member States the\r\nopportunity of understanding the judicial work of the Court,\r\nand it gives the Court the opportunity of forging closer\r\nbonds of cooperation and communication with the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy delegation would have appreciated having more\r\ntime to study the report of the Court. We respectfully urge\r\nthe Secretariat and the Court to ensure that in future the\r\ndocument will be distributed far enough in advance of its\r\nconsideration here. We are certain that in this way the\r\ndialogue will become more useful and fruitful.\r\nRespect for and due compliance with the norms of\r\ninternational law are and have been one of Mexico’s main\r\ncommitments. We are convinced that international\r\ncoexistence based on respect for the fundamental norms of\r\nlaw and justice is the best guarantee of peace. Hence, in\r\nthis and other forums we are promoting the codification and\r\nprogressive development of international law, and we\r\nsupport all those activities that result in the strengthening of\r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\nThe number of cases now before the Court is\r\nundoubtedly encouraging. More and more States are\r\nconsidering the Court as a viable alternative means of\r\nresolving their disputes. At the same time, as has been\r\npointed out in the past by the President of the Court, the\r\nincrease in the number of cases should not be viewed too\r\noptimistically. We note with concern that sometimes the\r\nenthusiasm with which declarations of acceptance of the\r\nCourt’s jurisdiction are made turns into reluctance to accept\r\nthat jurisdiction in practice.\r\nThe advisory proceedings are a dynamic and simple\r\nmechanism that allows the organs of the United Nations to\r\nbenefit from the experience of a high-level institution and\r\nto contribute to the clarification and development of\r\ninternational law. Mexico emphasizes the importance of the\r\nadvisory proceedings and urges those entities that are\r\nauthorized to request opinions of the Court to make more\r\nsystematic use of this mechanism. We particularly urge the\r\nSecurity Council to reflect on the advantages of this\r\nmechanism and to use it more frequently. We are\r\nconvinced that this would be of benefit to the Council\r\nitself and to the international community as a whole.\r\nAt the same time, in touching on the subject of\r\nadvisory opinions, I must point out that Mexico attaches\r\nparticular importance to those currently being processed\r\nby the Court. In our view, the requests mentioned in\r\nchapter III of the report bear witness to the significant\r\nwork that can be done by the Court through its advisory\r\nopinions. We believe that the Court now has an\r\ninvaluable opportunity to support other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations in the fulfilment of their functions and to\r\ncontribute to defining the norms of international law. We\r\nare convinced that the Court will avail itself of this\r\nopportunity.\r\nMr. Villagran Kramer (Guatemala) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): First of all, we should like to congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election. We also wish to\r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice\r\nboth for the Court’s report and for the thoughts he kindly\r\nshared with us on the extremely sensitive and important\r\nwork of that lofty forum.\r\nWe also wish to express our sorrow at the death of\r\nthree very distinguished judges: Judge Tarassov, Judge\r\nAgo and the Latin American Judge Ruda.\r\nThe report submitted to us not only covers the work\r\nof the Court itself but also coincides with the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and of that important\r\ntribunal. Although the Court will celebrate its anniversary\r\nin April 1996, since it was established in 1946, it is\r\nlogical at this time that we consider the Court’s current\r\nreport in the context of the fiftieth anniversary of that\r\ninstitution.\r\nWe are very satisfied with the way the report deals\r\nwith the subject of the jurisdiction of the International\r\nCourt of Justice. At the same time, it gives our delegation\r\na great deal of food for thought. On the one hand, 59\r\nStates have accepted the Court’s jurisdiction under an\r\noptional clause; on the other, there is a movement afoot\r\nto restrict the scope of acceptance of the Court’s\r\njurisdiction through the method of making reservations\r\nwhen jurisdiction is accepted. While we are delighted that\r\na large number of States are accepting jurisdiction\r\nthrough this optional modality, we are also concerned that\r\nthe tendency to resort to the unilateral act of acceptance\r\nof jurisdiction is motivated by a desire to set conditions\r\non appearances before the Court or to raise reservations\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nthat ultimately restrict its jurisdiction. In any case, this is a\r\nsubject which my delegation believes should be discussed\r\nand studied, either in the Sixth Committee or in a working\r\ngroup that is undoubtedly to be established on the matter.\r\nThere is yet another element of jurisdiction that offers\r\nus a strong option which is being used with increasing\r\nfrequency and which strengthens the role of the Court.\r\nWhen international treaties are signed between States, this\r\noption allows them to bring disagreements over the\r\nimplementation and interpretation of these treaties before\r\nthe Court. This option demonstrated its soundness precisely\r\nin the case of two Central American countries that were\r\ninvolved in 1988 in a dispute over the implementation of\r\nthe so-called Bogotá Pact and that were able to resolve a\r\njurisdictional problem in an exemplary manner.\r\nAnother comment we wish to make concerns the\r\nCourt’s current workload, which shows us that it is possible\r\nfor the work of international tribunals to be diversified. For\r\nexample, in the future States will certainly wish cases of\r\nmaritime delimitation to be considered within the\r\nframework of the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea. Furthermore, we feel that international criminal cases\r\nwould undoubtedly be dealt with by an international\r\ncriminal tribunal, if the Assembly decides to establish such\r\na tribunal. This obviously would restrict the International\r\nCourt of Justice’s sphere of action, and we could then\r\nenvisage the idea of a counterpart. Such a counterpart has\r\nbeen referred to this morning in the context of the need for\r\nconstitutional control over the activities of some of the\r\norgans of the United Nations. I should like briefly to refer\r\nto this subject.\r\nThe period when we are considering an expansion of\r\nthe Security Council’s work and membership and are all\r\nexpressing our views on the appropriateness of such an\r\nexpansion is undoubtedly the time to reflect on whether or\r\nnot we should give the Court the power to monitor the\r\nlegality of the actions of the Council and the Assembly.\r\nThis issue has been raised this morning. Our delegation\r\nacknowledges and takes note of the concept of\r\nconstitutional control and firmly associates itself with the\r\ncomments made on that subject.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to point out that the future\r\nof the Court, which is so strongly linked to the future of the\r\nUnited Nations, must be viewed in the context of a\r\nchanging world that is presenting us with new realities. The\r\nfirst of these realities is that the membership of the United\r\nNations has increased. It has increased to the extent that we\r\nmight ask whether it would be appropriate to increase the\r\nnumber of judges on the Court. My delegation does not\r\nhave a position on this subject but it is prepared to\r\nconsider whether, in the light of the fact that there are\r\nnow 185 Member States, the number of judges — 15 —\r\nprovided for the Permanent Court of Justice from 1922 to\r\n1945 should be increased.\r\nFurthermore, we are sympathetic to and favour the\r\npossibility of giving international organizations access to\r\nthe Court and of enabling them to initiate procedures.\r\nSimilarly, we believe that it would be prudent and\r\nappropriate for the Secretary-General of our Organization\r\nto have the power to request advisory opinions on very\r\nspecific cases, and the nature of such cases would have to\r\nbe established.\r\nLastly, the new dichotomy in international relations\r\nis obvious: international relations and transnational\r\nrelations. We know that, in the context of international\r\nrelations, States and international organizations are\r\nintensely involved with one another. We all work in those\r\ncircles. But we also know that we are players and\r\nparticipants in a transnational arena. State enterprises,\r\nprivate corporations and organizations established to\r\npromote economic activity are growing and intensifying\r\ntheir work to such an extent that we may eventually have\r\nto consider the possibility of their being allowed to\r\naccede to the Court or to other mechanisms to be\r\nestablished.\r\nFinally, we wish to thank the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for having shared with us\r\nhis thoughts, which are born of his judicial wisdom and\r\nexperience as a judge and, above all, as an eminent jurist.\r\nYou, Mr. President, are another such jurist.\r\nMr. Muntasser (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): I am pleased to associate\r\nmyself with those who preceded me in welcoming\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice and his fellow judges. I am\r\nalso delighted to congratulate him on his presentation of\r\nthe Court’s report.\r\nMy country has had recourse more than once to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, the haven to which\r\ncountries go in search of justice under the rules of\r\ninternational legality. I am pleased to state that the\r\nCourt’s judgments are received with full respect, whether\r\nor not they are in our favour. My country has consistently\r\nimplemented them fully and without delay. It is sufficient\r\nto refer to the last ruling on the border dispute between\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nChad and my country, which we applied without delay, as\r\nattested to by the statement of the Secretary-General.\r\nMy country hastened to the International Court of\r\nJustice and presented to it the so-called Lockerbie case, as\r\nwe hoped that the provisions of the Charter and of the\r\nMontreal Convention in respect of civil aviation cases\r\nwould be applied.\r\nThe matter is still under consideration by the Court.\r\nThis is a purely legal case, which some parties have\r\ntransformed into a political issue and have presented it as\r\nsuch to the Security Council. Economic and political\r\nsanctions have been imposed on my country, as a result of\r\nwhich the Libyan people as well as the neighbouring\r\npeoples continue to suffer.\r\nAs a small developing State, we look up to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, as represented by its\r\nPresident and judges, and we attach great hopes to it. We\r\ntrust that it will emphasize the rule of law and thereby put\r\npaid to the ambitions of certain circles to impose the law of\r\nforce, a tendency which, regrettably, became noticeable\r\nafter the end of the cold war in using the Security Council\r\nas a tool to impose such hegemony.\r\nThe President: We have now heard the last speaker\r\non this item for this meeting. May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 155\r\nObserver status for the Central American Integration\r\nSystem in the General Assembly: draft resolution\r\n(A/50/L.2)\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of El\r\nSalvador to introduce the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.2.\r\nMr. Castaneda-Cornejo (El Salvador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): On behalf of the Central American\r\ncountries, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua,\r\nPanama and El Salvador, I have the honour to make this\r\nstatement by way of an introduction to the draft resolution\r\non agenda item 155, entitled “Observer status for the\r\nCentral American Integration System in the General\r\nAssembly”.\r\nIn 1987, when our Governments decided to take up\r\nthe historic challenge of achieving a political solution to\r\nthe Central American crisis through the peace process\r\nadopted in Esquipulas II, they also recognized that peace\r\nand development were inseparable and that the\r\nconsolidation of democracy presupposed the establishment\r\nof a system of well-being and economic and social\r\njustice, which is indispensable in helping to overcome the\r\ndeep-rooted causes of that conflict.\r\nThe fulfilment of the commitments contained in\r\nEsquipulas II led to progress in the process of\r\npeacemaking and democratization, thus creating space for\r\nthe analysis, negotiation and agreement of measures and\r\nmechanisms to be adopted for the coordination,\r\nconsultation and follow-up of the commitments adopted\r\nby the Central American Presidents at the summit\r\nmeetings, and particularly as regards national and regional\r\nefforts to meet the priority challenges of a political,\r\neconomic, social, environmental and security-related\r\nnature. Indeed, the Declaration of Antigua, Guatemala, of\r\n12 June 1990 reaffirmed their statement that “we have\r\nCentral American paths to peace and development”.\r\nAccordingly, as of 1990, the Central American\r\nGovernments in the process of strengthening peace and\r\ndemocracy saw the need to examine the restructuring,\r\nstrengthening and reactivation of regional economic\r\nintegration, and the need to make this a means to promote\r\ndevelopment objectives and to readapt and improve\r\nCentral America’s position as part of its efforts to align\r\nitself with the new international environment. All this\r\nculminated in the signing of the Protocol of Tegucigalpa\r\nto the Charter of the Organization of Central American\r\nStates on 13 December 1991, which established the\r\nCentral American Integration System. The System began\r\nto operate on 1 February 1993.\r\nThe Central American Integration System is a\r\nrenewed and dynamic mechanism responsible for\r\npromoting not the sectoral, economic or commercial\r\nintegration of the past, but rather a global process, which\r\nencompasses the political, economic, social, cultural and\r\nenvironmental spheres, ensuring effective coordination\r\namong the organs, agencies and institutions of the\r\nIntegration System. It guarantees sustainable development,\r\nin balance and harmony, to facilitate the attainment of the\r\nvital objectives established in the Framework Treaty\r\ncreating the system to turn Central America\r\n“into a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment” (A/49/580, annex I, para. 51 (a))\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\non the firm basis of respect for and protection and\r\npromotion of the human rights of Central Americans. This,\r\nin the final analysis, can contribute to regional unity in\r\nresponse to the traditional aspirations of our peoples.\r\nIt is essential to emphasize that the promotion and\r\nimplementation of the new integral development strategy in\r\nCentral America at the national and regional levels should\r\ntake shape through the Alliance for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, in which priorities are set in the areas that I\r\nhave just mentioned, in accordance with presidential\r\ndecisions. This is based on the support for the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System, through close cooperation\r\nbetween its General Secretariat and the technical\r\nsecretariats of the regional subsystems and entities. Further\r\ninformation on this development strategy and on the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System can be found in documents\r\nA/49/580 of 27 October 1994 and A/50/146 of 20 July\r\n1995.\r\nThe relevance of regional integration in its\r\nmultidimensional design and in the framework of respect\r\nfor pluralism and ethnic diversity was reaffirmed, in the\r\nDeclaration of San Salvador II, at the Central American\r\nSummit Conference held in El Salvador in March this year\r\nin response to the challenges resulting from recent regional\r\nand global changes caused by the globalization of\r\nproduction, new computer-based technologies and new\r\norganizational methods. That meeting made headway in the\r\nprocess through the adoption of the Treaty on Central\r\nAmerican Social Integration, which established within the\r\nCentral American Integration System the legal, institutional\r\nand operational framework to promote this objective. This,\r\nin turn, reflects the commitment of Central American\r\nGovernments to making every effort to improve the\r\nstandard of living of our peoples.\r\nBearing in mind the new development strategy and the\r\nrole assigned to the Central American Integration System,\r\nour Presidents have attached prime importance to\r\nstrengthening the System as an institution and its\r\nparticipation and approach at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels, thus enabling it to fulfil its role\r\nefficiently.\r\nIt is in this context that the Central American countries\r\ntook the initiative to request the inclusion of item 155 —\r\nthe item that we are now considering — on the General\r\nAssembly’s agenda. The draft resolution under this item is\r\nentitled “Observer status for the Central American\r\nIntegration System” and is sponsored by countries from\r\ndifferent regional groups. At this time I wish to inform the\r\nAssembly that to the list of sponsors contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.2 the following countries have been\r\nadded: Algeria, Barbados, Canada, Cuba, Cyprus, Greece,\r\nGuyana, Iceland, Japan, the Marshall Islands, Poland, the\r\nRussian Federation, Sweden and Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nThe draft resolution, in its preambular part, refers to\r\nthe Tegucigalpa Protocol — which has been registered in\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat — through which purposes,\r\nprinciples and institutional structure in Central America\r\nhave been modified by the establishment of the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System. It also points out that one\r\nof the basic principles of the System is respect for the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn the operative part of the draft resolution the\r\nGeneral Assembly decides to invite the Central American\r\nIntegration System to participate in the sessions and the\r\nwork of the General Assembly in the capacity of\r\nobserver, and it requests the Secretary-General to take the\r\nnecessary action to implement the resolution.\r\nConvinced that the granting of observer status to the\r\nCentral American Integration System will facilitate\r\nattainment of the primary objectives of Central America,\r\nwe have no doubt that, with the complete support of\r\nMember States, the draft resolution will be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nI should like to conclude by quoting from a decision\r\nadopted by the Central American Presidents at their last\r\nspecial session, which was held in Costa del Sol, El\r\nSalvador, on 5 October this year:\r\n“We reaffirm our desire that observer status at the\r\nUnited Nations be granted to the Central American\r\nIntegration System (SICA), and we are grateful for\r\nthe many expressions of support for this desire by\r\nState Members of the United Nations. At the same\r\ntime, we urge the international community as a\r\nwhole to provide its valuable support for putting this\r\ninitiative into effect”\r\nand for the achievement of the objectives and aspirations\r\nof the Central American peoples.\r\nMr. Dumitriu (Romania) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Romania is among the sponsors of draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.2, which requests that observer status at\r\nthe General Assembly be granted to the Central American\r\nIntegration System.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nMy delegation has many reasons for supporting the\r\ndraft resolution. We should like to underscore just two of\r\nthese.\r\nFirst, we believe that the efforts of the Central\r\nAmerican countries to adapt to a new regional reality — in\r\nother words, a Central America that is more orderly and\r\ndemocratic — deserve our support. The determination of\r\nthese countries to broaden and strengthen the region’s\r\nparticipation in the international sphere is also\r\ncommendable. Not too long ago, when we referred to this\r\nregion we talked about wars, conflicts and peace-keeping\r\noperations. Fortunately, now, as is emphasized in the\r\nexplanatory memorandum related to document A/50/146,\r\nwhat we are talking about is the quest for integral well-\r\nbeing and sustainable development for Central\r\nAmericans — making Central America a region of peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy and development. This is a change of\r\nprofound significance, which we should all commend.\r\nSecondly, my delegation sincerely believes in the\r\nvirtues of integration. Romania itself is seeking full\r\nintegration into European economic, political and security\r\nstructures. For this reason, Romania sympathizes deeply\r\nwith the integration efforts of Central American and other\r\ncountries.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation takes great pleasure in\r\nsupporting the draft resolution now under the General\r\nAssembly’s consideration and hopes that it will be adopted\r\nby consensus.\r\nMr. Laing (Belize): The delegation of Belize is\r\nhonoured to be a sponsor of draft resolution A/50/L.2. The\r\nGovernment of Belize, a country in the very heart of\r\nCentral America, has observed the recent evolution of the\r\nCentral American integration process with increasing\r\nsatisfaction. In an era of convergence, it is doubly\r\ngratifying to reflect that in this effort of integration those\r\nStates of Central America which are members of this\r\nIntegration System are merely continuing a distinguished\r\ntradition of close, organized cooperation now nearly 200\r\nyears old. We applaud our neighbours for continuing to\r\nlead the world in this matter.\r\nThe Government of Belize has had the signal honour\r\nof regularly cooperating with the member States and the\r\ninstitutions of this Integration System. In particular, I wish\r\nto advert to our participation in the Alliance for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the Alliance for Social Development. We\r\nhave been particularly gratified by the fact that the activities\r\nwithin that framework now embrace the cultural, social and\r\npolitical spheres. Only by integrated action can there be\r\ngenuine, harmonious and balanced development of\r\npeoples, individuals and member States. Belize’s\r\nparticipation in these activities reflects the wisdom of the\r\nparties to the treaty viewing the region as an organic\r\nwhole in which historically diverse cultures can make a\r\ndignified contribution. We are grateful that Belize’s\r\nparticipation now transcends its being a passive recipient\r\nof internationally displaced persons from the rest of\r\nCentral America, who are now over 20 per cent of our\r\npopulation.\r\nThe delegation of Belize fully agrees that the\r\ncooperation and integration to which this draft resolution\r\nadverts will most probably conduce to the furtherance of\r\nregional peace and reconciliation for which we all yearn.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the request for the\r\ndeepening of cooperation with the United Nations through\r\nthe according of observer status to the institution. Of\r\ncourse, such details as the applicability of Chapter VIII of\r\nthe Charter, referred to in the explanatory memorandum,\r\nwill bear further examination. But in general, my\r\ndelegation fully supports the text of this important draft\r\nresolution and requests that it be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker on\r\nthis item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.2.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.2?\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.2 was adopted (resolution\r\n50/2).\r\nThe President: In accordance with the resolution\r\njust adopted, I now call on the Secretary-General of the\r\nCentral American Integration System, His Excellency\r\nMr. Roberto Herrera Cáceres.\r\nMr. Herrera Cáceres (Secretary-General, Central\r\nAmerican Integration System) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me, as a Central American,\r\nto reiterate the congratulations expressed to you, Sir, by\r\nthe representatives of Central American States on your\r\nrightful election to the presidency of the Assembly. Your\r\npresence ensures that it will be wisely guided.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\nAs Secretary-General of the Central American\r\nIntegration System (SICA), I wish also to express our deep\r\nappreciation for the decision to invite the Central American\r\nIntegration System to participate, as an observer, in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly at this session.\r\nThe granting of observer status at the United Nations\r\nis very significant, as it is a manifestation of the ever\r\ngreater understanding in the United Nations of the\r\nfundamental role of subregional organizations, such as the\r\nCentral American Integration System, that have been\r\nrecognized and followed by the General Assembly itself, as\r\ncan be seen in resolutions 48/161 of 1993 and 49/137 of\r\n1994, entitled “The situation in Central America:\r\nprocedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace\r\nand progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development”.\r\nIn those resolutions it is recognized that the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System\r\n“constitutes the institutional framework for subregional\r\nintegration through which integrated development can\r\nbe promoted in an effective, orderly and coherent\r\nmanner”. (resolutions 48/161 and 49/137, third\r\npreambular paragraph)\r\nIn addition, the General Assembly stresses\r\n“the importance of honouring the commitments to\r\naccelerate the establishment of a new model of\r\nregional security in Central America as established in\r\nthe Tegucigalpa Protocol of 13 December 1991, which\r\nestablished the Central American Integration System\r\n(SICA)”. (resolution 48/161, ninth preambular\r\nparagraph)\r\nIn its earlier resolutions the General Assembly also\r\nhighlights\r\n“the functioning of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem since 1 February 1993 and the registry of the\r\nTegucigalpa Protocol with the United Nations\r\nSecretariat, expresses its full support for the efforts\r\nmade by Central Americans, under the political\r\nleadership of their Presidents, to stimulate and broaden\r\nthe integration process in the context of the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System, and calls on Member\r\nStates and international organizations to provide\r\neffective cooperation to Central America so that it can\r\nsteadily promote and strengthen subregional\r\nintegration in order to make it an effective mechanism\r\nfor achieving sustainable development”. (resolution\r\n49/137, para. 5)\r\nIn keeping with this appeal, the United Nations has\r\nnow fraternally embraced us, bearing witness to the great\r\necumenical interdependence characteristic of the present\r\nday. It has done this by granting us observer status on\r\nthis day which coincides with the celebration of Hispanic\r\nDay and, in particular, on the day on which we Central\r\nAmericans are celebrating the first anniversary of the\r\nsigning, at the meeting of Central American Presidents\r\nand the Prime Minister of Belize, of the Alliance for the\r\nSustainable Development of Central America, which\r\nconstitutes the strategy for the integral development of the\r\nCentral American isthmus.\r\nOn this day we Central Americans are also\r\ncelebrating the first anniversary of the entry into force of\r\nour Central American Court of Justice, which is the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the Central American\r\nIntegration System (SICA), entrusted with ensuring\r\nrespect for the law in the interpretation and application of\r\nthe Tegucigalpa Protocol, the Alliance for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Central America and of other instruments\r\nand acts that complement them and stem from them. This\r\nmakes it clear that the Central American isthmus is\r\nadvancing steadily towards the perfecting of a Central\r\nAmerican community of law.\r\nThe Central American Integration System, in\r\naddition to working towards the integral development of\r\nthe isthmus in the economic, social, cultural, political and\r\necological spheres, and guided by its regional\r\ndevelopment strategy, is also working to conclude a treaty\r\nof regional democratic security based on the strengthening\r\nof civil authority; on the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment; on the protection of the environment; on the\r\neradication of extreme poverty and of violence,\r\ncorruption, terrorism, drug trafficking and the traffic in\r\narms; on a reasonable balance of forces; and on\r\nconfidence-building measures.\r\nThis new model of Central American democratic\r\nsecurity also includes a regional plan for disaster\r\nreduction and an institutional force for Central American\r\nsolidarity, whose task it is to coordinate the capacities and\r\nthe resources of the Central American States with those\r\nof SICA in order to combat natural threats and disasters.\r\nWith all these arrangements, the Central American people\r\nwill be working with greater confidence and resolve to\r\nachieve sustainable development, in the knowledge that\r\nthere exists the political will, the legal system and the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 12 October 1995\r\naction-oriented mechanisms whose progressive\r\nimplementation will protect them from the military and\r\nnon-military dangers and risks that could jeopardize their\r\nlasting development.\r\nThe broad-ranging and open design of the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System reflects the importance we\r\nattach to effective give-and-take with other regional\r\nsystems, with the inter-American system and with the\r\nUnited Nations system, in order to promote actions and\r\ninteractions of mutual advantage that can enable the\r\norganizations and their member States to benefit from the\r\nbest experiences and from the progress of mankind.\r\nIn this context, the progress and democratization of\r\norganizations and of the international order have as a\r\ncommon denominator humanistic criteria and the criteria of\r\nsolidarity and the promotion of equal opportunities for their\r\nsocieties to enjoy in a just and fair fashion the fruits of the\r\neconomy, of trade, of information and training, of science\r\nand technology — in a word, of development, regardless of\r\nthe part of the world where these factors are being\r\nstrengthened. Only in this way will it be possible for us\r\nto move from a world divided for all to a world shared by\r\nall.\r\nThe Central American Integration System and the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) began their\r\nrelations of international cooperation in 1994. The\r\nSecretaries-General of the two organizations have\r\nconcluded a cooperation agreement that will make it\r\neasier to exploit together the possibilities for mutual\r\nsupport with a view to integral development.\r\nThe General Assembly of the OAS has requested\r\nthat we effectively coordinate American regional action\r\nwith Central American subregional action and we, in\r\nSICA, are prepared to coordinate our work in the most\r\neffective way possible.\r\nFor these and other reasons, the granting of observer\r\nstatus requires all the organs and institutions of the\r\nCentral American Integration System to offer all our\r\nexperience as a juridical and political organization of the\r\nCentral American isthmus to this prestigious universal\r\nOrganization and to its Member States. At the same time,\r\nit requires us to avail ourselves of the wealth of\r\nexperience of the United Nations, which we also hope to\r\napply in our daily work through efficient and harmonious\r\ncoordination that will increasingly make possible the best\r\nuse of the efforts and the resources of the member States\r\nof our respective organizations.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 155?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.45 p.m.\r\n18\r\n"
