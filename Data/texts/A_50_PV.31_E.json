(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/50/444/Add.4)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/50/444/Add.4, the Secretary-General informs me that,\r\nsince the issuance of his communications dated 19 and\r\n22 September and 2 and 4 October 1995, the Gambia has\r\nmade the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the\r\namount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 157\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Agency\r\nfor Cultural and Technical Cooperation\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.4\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of France\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/50/L.4.\r\nMr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nI am honoured, as Chairman of the francophone Group at\r\nthe United Nations, to introduce draft resolution A/50/L.4.\r\nThe draft resolution, which is particularly dear to the\r\nhearts of all the members of the francophone family,\r\nrelates to cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation.\r\nThe Agency is the cornerstone of the institutional\r\nedifice of the francophone movement. It is composed of\r\n44 countries from the five continents, representing 400\r\nmillion human beings, in Europe, sub-Saharan Africa,\r\nAsia, the Pacific, the Americas, the Caribbean, the Indian\r\nOcean, the Maghreb and the Near East, that share, to\r\nvarying degrees, use of the French language.\r\nBut, above and beyond the use of the French\r\nlanguage, the francophone peoples share a common\r\nculture, marked by the diversity of their roots, but always\r\nbased on the principles of tolerance and respect for the\r\nindividual.\r\nMore than a regional organization or a community\r\nof interests, the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation, therefore, shares one basic feature with the\r\nUnited Nations: affirmation of unity and common\r\nmembership, with respect for plurality. The Agency\r\nrepresents, in effect, a group of countries that draw on\r\ntheir will to act together with respect for others and their\r\nattachment to the values of dialogue, complementarity and\r\nsolidarity. That was how the founding fathers of the\r\nfrancophone movement — the eminent Heads of State,\r\nPresidents Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal, Hamani\r\nDiori of Niger and Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia — saw in\r\nthe 1970s the future of the francophone community. And\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nit is in this spirit that this community strives today,\r\nalongside the United Nations and other organizations, to\r\nmake its contribution to world peace and development.\r\nAllow me briefly to remind the Assembly of the\r\nnature of the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation. A unique, intergovernmental institution for\r\nfrancophone countries, it was founded in Niamey in 1970,\r\ncharged with laying the foundation for cooperation and\r\nsolidarity between all francophone countries. In addition to\r\nbeing the major actor in multilateral francophone\r\ncooperation, the Agency has also, since the Chaillot Summit\r\nin 1991, taken on the role of secretariat for all the\r\nfrancophone movement’s institutions. Employing today\r\nmore than 2,500 people, the Agency has a budget of\r\napproximately $100 million. It has an office at United\r\nNations Headquarters in New York.\r\nThe Agency has many recent achievements to its\r\ncredit; I shall mention just a few. In the cultural area, the\r\nAgency has provided outstanding support to the intellectual\r\noutput of countries of the South. Through the television\r\nchannel TV5 Afrique, the Agency has contributed to the\r\ndevelopment of francophone television on a world scale.\r\nThrough its fund to support audiovisual productions by\r\ncountries of the South, the Agency significantly assists the\r\ncreative talents of that part of the world.\r\nThe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation\r\nhas also had many successes in technical cooperation,\r\nresponding to the expectations of the countries of the South.\r\nIn particular, the Agency has developed a vast network of\r\nservice centres for the circulation of technical and\r\nprofessional information. Likewise, some 3,500 trainees\r\nreceived support from the Agency to follow training\r\ncourses in 1992-1993.\r\nIn recent years the Agency has developed its support\r\nprogrammes for democratization; its participation is assured\r\nin monitoring elections, establishing consciousness-raising\r\nand training programmes in respect to human rights and\r\nsupporting parliamentary and judicial institutions. These\r\nactivities, particularly desired by many countries, now make\r\nthe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation a\r\nleading institution.\r\nStrengthening cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Agency is now seen by both sides to be a necessity.\r\nThis is above all true of the United Nations, which in\r\nrecent years has constantly affirmed its desire for\r\ncoordination with international actors outside the system\r\nand its desire to strengthen its work of coordination. For\r\ntheir part, the francophone States have voiced at their\r\nhighest forums, the Chaillot Summit in 1991 and the\r\nMauritius Summit in 1993, their desire to give a more\r\npolitical dimension to their work and to boost their active\r\npresence on the international scene.\r\nThe francophone community has thus decided to\r\ninvolve itself in the family of nations and to participate in\r\nall the major debates. First and foremost, the francophone\r\ncountries of the South and of the North need to establish\r\na relationship designed to institute consultations —\r\npossibly negotiations — on the political and human\r\nproblems that arise around the world.\r\nThus, active francophone consultations took place on\r\nthe occasion of recent major international conferences: the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, in Rio de Janeiro in 1992; the World\r\nConference on Human Rights, in Vienna in 1993; the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nin Cairo in 1994; the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, in Copenhagen that year; and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, which has just taken place\r\nin Beijing. On all these occasions, the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation helped organize and\r\ncoordinate the participation of the French-speaking States.\r\nWith the same aim of strengthening the francophone\r\npresence in international cooperation, the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation opened liaison offices\r\nin Geneva in 1991 and with the European Union in\r\nBrussels in 1994. As I mentioned earlier, it has just\r\nopened an office in New York as well, thus manifesting\r\nits desire to forge closer ties with the United Nations and\r\nto play a more active and concrete role as an Observer, a\r\nstatus it has enjoyed since 1978.\r\nLastly, I wish to stress the clear complementarity of\r\nthe activities of the United Nations and those of the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation in the\r\npromotion of economic, social and political development.\r\nThe rich and diverse programme of activities of the\r\nAgency in the fields of culture, communication,\r\neducation, technical assistance and the promotion of\r\ndemocracy parallel in every way the concerns of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn this context, the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation has of course already been\r\nworking with several regional and international\r\norganizations. Hence, its close relations with the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nhave helped to lay the basis of a joint commission of these\r\ntwo organizations. Similarly, joint programmes have been\r\ndeveloped with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the United Nations Children’s Fund.\r\nWe are convinced that the draft resolution now before\r\nthe General Assembly will pave the way for even more\r\nfruitful cooperation between our two organizations, and we\r\ntherefore call on the Assembly to adopt it.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation was\r\nfounded 25 years ago in Niamey to promote multilateral\r\ncooperation between countries that use French as a common\r\nlanguage. At the beginning it had 21 States and\r\nGovernments as members; it now has 44, nearly one quarter\r\nof the States Members of the United Nations, distributed\r\nthroughout the five continents.\r\nThe international cooperation which the Agency\r\nengendered has lasted 25 years and the number of States\r\nand Governments which it has brought together has more\r\nthan doubled in that time. This is proof that its founders,\r\nthree great Heads of State — President Léopold Sédar\r\nSenghor of Senegal, President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia\r\nand President Hamani Diori of Niger — accurately foresaw\r\nthe need to affirm the ties of cooperation and solidarity\r\nbetween countries that history or geography had once\r\nlinked, but that history and the passage of time now\r\nthreatened to drive apart for ever.\r\nWith the end of colonialism and the restoration of\r\nindependence to many countries, a new historical dynamic,\r\nbased on the values of equality among peoples, justice and\r\nequitable economic cooperation, sought to exert itself. The\r\nmagnitude and originality of the vision of these three great\r\nAfrican wise men — confirmed by a quarter of a century\r\nof success and increasing vigour for the Agency —\r\nprobably lay in their understanding that culture could be a\r\nsource of mutual enrichment and fruitfulness, of\r\nrapprochement between peoples. This culture, in the larger,\r\nanthropological sense, included not only artistic expression\r\nand common languages and vernacular languages, but also\r\nthe ways of life, social organization and technology that\r\narise from the creativity, ability to adapt and intelligence\r\nthat men and women have had accumulated over time\r\nacross the five continents. Their vision was the founding\r\ninspiration of the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation.\r\nMoreover, this initiative fell within a favourable\r\ncontext of human dimension and a framework of values and\r\nhopes that were largely shared by sovereign States and\r\nGovernments linked by their use of the French language,\r\nwhich greatly helped the Agency first to be recognized\r\ninternationally and then to grow.\r\nTwenty-five years later, when the world and\r\nsocieties have profoundly changed and broad political,\r\neconomic and social upheavals have shaken our era, these\r\nexceptional qualities have allowed the Agency to maintain\r\nthe same desire for cooperation in a spirit of respect for\r\ncultures and dialogue between civilizations.\r\nBecause their wealth and their complementarity\r\nresult from their differences, the States and Governments\r\nthat are members or associates of the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation naturally strive to bring them\r\ninto play in the regular exchange of their experiences. In\r\nour opinion, this complementarity and sharing lend\r\nmultilateral francophone cooperation an original\r\ndimension based on respect for its participants, equality\r\nof its undertakings and balance in its political and\r\neconomic relations, which perfectly reflect the principles\r\nproclaimed by the United Nations in the San Francisco\r\nCharter and in the many texts, resolutions, declarations\r\nand conventions adopted since 1945.\r\nThe observer status in the General Assembly which\r\nthe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation has\r\nenjoyed since 1978 is confirmation — if confirmation is\r\nneeded — that the values of the United Nations are also\r\nthose of the francophone Agency. Its participation in\r\nimportant international meetings organized by the United\r\nNations on significant social issues are also an expression\r\nof its mission. The Agency has participated in\r\ninternational debates and exchanges of view, to which it\r\nhas brought its own way of thinking and the abilities of\r\nits own member States and Governments.\r\nThe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation\r\nattended the Rio Earth Summit, United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, in 1992.\r\nIt prepared carefully for this, with the encouragement of\r\nits own organs, particularly the summit of Heads of State\r\nand Government held in Dakar in May 1989, and further\r\nenriched by the work of its own experts, who carefully\r\nmonitored the preparatory work for this important\r\nconference.\r\nThe Government of the Principality of Monaco,\r\nhaving a particular interest in the topics under discussion\r\nat the world summit, was closely associated with it and is\r\npleased to welcome its results. The Ministerial\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nConference on the Environment and Development, meeting\r\nin Tunis in April 1993, furthermore adopted a five-year\r\nprogramme intended to contribute to the implementation of\r\nthe decisions that emerged from the Rio de Janeiro\r\nConference, and of its Agenda 21.\r\nThe same concern and the same careful attention were\r\ndevoted to the preparations for the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights organized by the United Nations in Vienna\r\nin 1993. The Agency’s general delegation for legal and\r\njudicial cooperation contributed to the preparation of that\r\nimportant Conference, with the involvement of specialists\r\nfrom Monaco. The Agency is now striving to provide for\r\nfollow-up activity on the part of its member States that\r\nwould strengthen and complement the initiatives taken by\r\nthe United Nations Centre for Human Rights.\r\nIn endeavouring to place the law at the service of\r\ndevelopment and democracy, this French-speaking\r\ninstitution is determined to develop a spirit in which the\r\nrule of law can be expressed on a daily basis.\r\nAlong these lines, it has for some years been\r\nincreasing the number of observer missions in countries\r\nwhere the multiparty system is being developed at their\r\nrequest, thus associating itself with the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in this area.\r\nIn many other fields, too, the Agency is lending its\r\nsupport to activities being carried out by our world\r\nOrganization that relate to economic and social\r\ndevelopment. It often takes its inspiration from the major\r\nconclusions of world conferences in which it has taken an\r\nactive part alongside States and Member Governments or\r\nassociate bodies, such as the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development at Cairo, the World Summit\r\non Social Development at Copenhagen and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, which has just concluded in\r\nBeijing.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco is pleased to note that the\r\nAgency has established cooperation with a number of\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies which, by virtue of\r\ntheir fields of competence, have mandates that are close or\r\ncomplementary in nature. This is the case with the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) in the area of education and training, for\r\nexample.\r\nIn this respect, its initiatives are based broadly on the\r\nrecommendations of the United Nations Conference\r\norganized by UNESCO in 1990 in Jomtien, Thailand, as\r\nwell as on the programme of action adopted by the\r\nconference of Francophone Ministers of Education.\r\nIn a spirit of cooperation and partnership among its\r\nmembers, scientific and technical information is also one\r\nof the Agency’s priorities. In the view of my delegation,\r\nsuch information can play a part in any action aimed at\r\nhuman development.\r\nIn the areas of energy and agricultural development,\r\nthe role of the Agency is constantly growing and being\r\nstrengthened, primarily to the advantage of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries. Sustainable development and lasting\r\ngrowth are crucial to the programmes in this field. We\r\nparticularly appreciate and approve of this approach.\r\nAs for cultural exchanges, the Agency plays an\r\nexemplary role. I would just mention by way of example\r\nthe Market of African Performing Arts (MASA), which\r\nregularly brings together in Côte d’Ivoire the best artists\r\nof four continents in an encounter that is increasingly\r\nsuccessful every year.\r\nThe World Amateur Theatre Festival, organized\r\nevery four years in Monaco, benefits from the assistance\r\nof the Agency, which has always made a remarkably\r\nhigh-quality contribution to the selection of African\r\ntheatre troupes invited to attend.\r\nInter-personal communication is also one of the\r\nAgency’s major concerns. The challenges that multilateral\r\ncooperation faces as a result of technical advances and\r\nchanges in the media, telecommunications and\r\ncomputerization, have been very seriously taken into\r\naccount in the French-speaking world. The mastery of\r\nmodern communication tools in the service of the\r\nFrancophone community has always been encouraged by\r\nmy Government, which welcomes the recent\r\nachievements in this field.\r\nThe support fund for the audiovisual productions of\r\nthe countries of the South, the exchange of radio and\r\ntelevision staff, the development of TV5 in Africa and\r\nlocal radio are among the methods being developed to\r\nmeet these challenges, and which we are always happy to\r\nencourage.\r\nThe promotion of live arts, theatre, dance, music and\r\npublic readings through the medium of reading and\r\ncultural animation centres in rural areas, as well as\r\nassistance in publishing and the granting of literary prizes,\r\nare also activities devoted to this same end. The Agency\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nis doing very original and innovative work in this area,\r\nwhich we are happy to highlight, and which we feel should\r\nbe encouraged by this Organization.\r\nFinally the Agency, in one of its more important\r\nresponsibilities, has since the summit of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment in Chaillot in 1991 provided the secretariat for\r\nall the bodies of the French-speaking movement. That\r\nincludes the summits themselves with their preparation and\r\nfollow-up, the annual ministerial conference, the general\r\nconference and the governing body of the Agency itself, as\r\nwell as the standing council on Francophonie, which plays\r\na leading political and coordinating role in these matters.\r\nThe Agency is performing its new functions skilfully\r\nand meticulously, thus strengthening its role as a major\r\ninstitution for the execution of the decisions of the political\r\nbodies of the French-speaking movement.\r\nFor all these reasons, and for many others that we will\r\nrefrain from mentioning here because of time constraints,\r\nMonaco, which was represented at Niamey in 1970 when\r\nthe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation was\r\nfounded, welcomes and appreciates the opportunity thus\r\ngranted to it today to encourage cooperation, which I would\r\ndescribe as natural, between the Agency and the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe debate which the General Assembly is devoting\r\nto this question and to the draft resolution which, I very\r\nmuch hope, we will be able to adopt, and of which Monaco\r\nis a sponsor, gives me grounds to hope that more and more\r\njoint initiatives may be taken in the future in the areas of\r\ncompetence common to the Agency and the United Nations.\r\nThe opening in New York of a permanent office for\r\nthe observer mission of the Agency to the United Nations\r\nsymbolizes this desire to strengthen cooperation between\r\nthe two multilateral institutions, while at the same time\r\noffering encouragement for the future, in that closer\r\ngeographical proximity should facilitate such cooperation.\r\nMr. Dorani (Djibouti) (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like first to welcome the important initiative taken\r\nby 44 States and Governments in the francophone world,\r\nstretching from America to Asia by way of Europe and\r\nAfrica, of submitting to the General Assembly a draft\r\nresolution entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation”.\r\nThe delegation of Djibouti endorses what the delegation of\r\nFrance said on behalf of our Group. In that statement the\r\nAmbassador of France was kind enough to explain the\r\nbackground to the draft resolution.\r\nKeeping a sense of proportion and intending to\r\noffend nobody, may I say that the Agency is a United\r\nNations in miniature, since a quarter of the countries\r\npresent here are represented in it. Apart from the United\r\nNations, it is the only organization where all races,\r\ncolours, religions and cultures of the world are\r\nrepresented; in other words, every characteristic of the\r\nworld’s peoples is represented. Its mandate is to affirm\r\nand develop among its members, and beyond, multilateral\r\ncooperation on matters ranging from education to\r\neconomic development, as well as ensuring a State of\r\nlaw.\r\nHowever, the Agency is not confined to these areas,\r\nhowever important they may be. It has already begun to\r\ndevelop a political dimension, using its own methods, by\r\ncontributing to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. In addition, conflict prevention is essential, and\r\nthe French-speaking community — by which I mean the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation — has\r\nalready committed itself to this kind of role, and will do\r\nso increasingly in the future.\r\nLet me mention the tragedy of Rwanda as just one\r\nexample. It was a very serious blow to the heart of the\r\nfrancophone community. Happily, a great country in our\r\nlarge family — great above all because of its values —\r\nhad the wisdom to take positive action, saving hundreds\r\nof thousands of lives. As a member of the Security\r\nCouncil at the time, Djibouti welcomed that initiative and\r\nthe noble task that was undertaken. The African continent\r\nas a whole will always be grateful to all the countries that\r\nhave taken humanitarian measures to help.\r\nThe francophone movement is now trying to define\r\nthe contribution that it should and can make to conflict\r\nprevention. Our movement will not develop parallel\r\nconflict-prevention measures, and it will not in any way\r\nset itself up as a rival to any international or regional\r\norganizations. On the contrary, we shall support their\r\nefforts.\r\nFinally, Djibouti believes that the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of this draft resolution will\r\ndemonstrate that the international community respects the\r\nideals of the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation. My country is keen to see such recognition\r\nof the Agency.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium) (interpretation from French):\r\nBelgium is one of the sponsors of the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation. In introducing the draft\r\nresolution, the Ambassador of France, as Chairman of the\r\nfrancophone Group, highlighted the Agency’s important\r\ncontribution to our work here, and the Ambassadors of\r\nMonaco and Djibouti have added to the information that he\r\ngave.\r\nBelgium welcomes the fact that the Agency now has\r\nan office at the United Nations. We believe that reinforcing\r\nthis presence is the beginning of a new partnership,\r\nstrengthening the Agency’s participation as an observer, a\r\nstatus that it has had for more than 17 years.\r\nThe draft resolution is an effort to strengthen\r\ncooperation that is not new, having already been\r\ndemonstrated. I am thinking especially about the Agency’s\r\nactive participation in recent major conferences —\r\nparticipation that my delegation in particular welcomed.\r\nThis cooperation can only strengthen, through a new\r\npartnership, the dialogue and communication that our\r\norganization aims to promote between countries which,\r\nthrough a common language, have cultural elements in\r\ncommon.\r\nThe francophone community is a reality which can\r\nonly benefit us, given the wealth and diversity of its\r\nmember States, as we seek solutions to the challenges\r\nfacing us in today’s world. The desire to help solve\r\npolitical problems is expressed here. Belgium is glad that\r\nthis partnership between the Agency and the United\r\nNations, can be a catalyst to give substance to that desire.\r\nWe trust that the draft resolution will be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Adechi (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nBenin was very honoured to join the delegations of many\r\nother francophone countries in taking the initiative of\r\nsubmitting to the General Assembly this draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation. The delegation of\r\nBenin endorses the statement made by the representative of\r\nFrance in his eloquent introduction of the draft resolution.\r\nLike those representatives who have already spoken,\r\nI pay tribute to the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation and testify to its tireless action in the cause of\r\ndevelopment and peace. Indeed, the Agency, which is the\r\nsole intergovernmental organization of the francophone\r\nworld, has been able, on the basis of a common language,\r\nto establish a dynamic solidarity between countries of\r\nAfrica, America, Asia and Europe.\r\nReflecting many different cultures, the Agency is\r\nincreasingly recognized as an important meeting point for\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation and solidarity between\r\npeoples. Here I pay it a well-deserved tribute for its\r\nvaluable participation in all the major conferences\r\norganized by the United Nations since 1990, as well as\r\nfor its initiatives to facilitate the participation of\r\nrepresentatives, Governments and non-governmental\r\norganizations of member States of the Agency.\r\nThe Agency’s sphere of operation, which includes\r\nsuch varied fields as education, communications, energy,\r\nenvironment and agriculture, among others, is well in\r\nkeeping with the spirit of the relevant provisions of the\r\nCharter envisaging resort to international institutions to\r\nfoster economic and social progress for all peoples. It was\r\nprecisely for the purpose of underscoring this\r\ncomplementary relationship between the Agency’s\r\nactivities and those of the United Nations that the Agency\r\nhas enjoyed observer status since 1978.\r\nCooperation between the Agency and the United\r\nNations, then, is nothing new. None the less, the new\r\nchallenges facing the community of nations today call for\r\nthe establishment of broader consensuses, a concerted\r\neffort and increased coordination of development policies\r\nin a spirit of fair competition and with respect for\r\ndiversity.\r\nThe strengthening of cooperation between the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation and the\r\nUnited Nations can only be a positive contribution. For\r\nthis reason, I strongly recommend this draft resolution to\r\nthe Assembly and am sure that it will choose to adopt it\r\nby consensus.\r\nMr. Diabate (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Côte d’Ivoire is a sponsor of the draft resolution\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation (ACTC).\r\nAllow me, on behalf of my delegation, to join earlier\r\nspeakers in stressing the importance of this subject, as\r\nwell as the keen interest my country takes in it.\r\nIt is fitting to recall that since its creation in 1970,\r\nthe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation,\r\nwhich at that time had 21 members and now has 44, has\r\npursued objectives similar to those set by the United\r\nNations. The Agency’s most important areas of activity\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\ncover education and training, culture, communications,\r\nagriculture, energy, environment, promotion and protection\r\nof human rights and support for the democratization\r\nprocess.\r\nThe concurrence between the purposes of the United\r\nNations and those of the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation is perfectly illustrated by the repeated mention\r\nof these topics by a number of speakers in the general\r\ndebate of the last three weeks and the fact that they have\r\nbeen studied extensively. This concurrence also indicates\r\nthe need for strengthened and increased cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations in order to bring their\r\ncommon ideals to fruition.\r\nFurthermore, in recent years, within the ACTC a\r\nnumber of activities have been developed that are worth\r\nmentioning because of the genuine benefits derived from\r\nthem by the francophone countries involved. I am referring\r\nin particular to assistance and logistical support provided by\r\nthe ACTC to the francophone countries of the South for\r\ntheir participation in world summits organized under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, such as the World Summit\r\nfor Children, held in New York in 1990, the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\r\nin 1992, the World Conference on Human Rights, held in\r\nVienna in 1993, the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, held in Cairo in 1994, the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, held in Copenhagen in 1994, and\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing\r\nin 1995. At such summits and conferences, the ACTC\r\norganizes consultative meetings for francophone countries,\r\nmakes necessary arrangements for certain governmental\r\ndelegations and non-governmental organizations and\r\npublishes a daily information bulletin in French.\r\nFurthermore, the ACTC provides francophone delegations\r\nwith a logistical-support secretariat. Thus, the significant\r\nrole played by the ACTC at the Beijing summit continues\r\nto have an impact, not simply because it was so recent, but,\r\nrather, because of the magnitude of its role and the extent\r\nto which it was appreciated by those whom it served.\r\nAll these ACTC initiatives, the scope of which we are\r\nnow taking the measure, are intended to facilitate the\r\nparticipation of some States in these summits. They are\r\nfrancophone States, to be sure, but they are also Members\r\nof this great family of the United Nations, and they are\r\nStates that without such logistical support would find it\r\ndifficult to participate effectively in such important world\r\nsummits. There can be no question that such initiatives are\r\nin keeping with another ideal shared by the United Nations\r\nand the ACTC: solidarity between Member States,\r\nbetween nations and between peoples.\r\nIn conclusion, in order to enable the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation to continue and\r\nfurther strengthen its cooperation with the United Nations,\r\nthe delegation of Côte d’Ivoire recommends that the\r\nGeneral Assembly unanimously adopt the draft resolution\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The consideration of the agenda item on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Agency\r\nfor Cultural and Technical Cooperation (ACTC) gives me\r\nthe opportunity to expound Tunisia’s viewpoint on the\r\npotential role of regional and supraregional organizations,\r\nsuch as the ACTC, in bringing peoples together and in\r\ncontributing to the renewal of multilateralism.\r\nWith specific regard to the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation (ACTC), I am pleased to recall\r\nthat this intergovernmental organization, based on\r\ncommon ideals of dialogue, solidarity and cooperation, is\r\ncomposed of 44 States and Governments whose peoples\r\nshare the French language as a cultural vehicle, a carrier\r\nof civilization and a tool for access and technical\r\nadvancement. Those are the hopes of the founding States,\r\nincluding Tunisia, for achievement of the objectives of the\r\nAgency, which was established in 1970 as a catalyst for\r\ndevelopment and mutual enrichment.\r\nOver the past 25 years, the Agency, despite its\r\nyouth, has carried out a wide variety of supraregional\r\nactivities, transcending ideological rifts at a time when the\r\ncold war was raging. That is why, despite all the\r\nobstacles, the Agency has been so successful, with the\r\nnumber of its member States and Governments rising\r\nfrom 21 at the beginning to 44 today. Over the same\r\nperiod, the Agency has responded to changes both\r\ninternationally and within its member States by\r\ndiversifying its activities and increasing the number of its\r\noperations and initiatives, thus meeting the hopes it has\r\naroused since its creation and revitalizing its patterns of\r\ncooperation on a dynamic and reinvigorated basis.\r\nHere I wish to touch on the main focuses of the\r\nAgency’s work. Apart from education, training, culture\r\nand communication, the ACTC has created specialized\r\ntraining programmes in the areas of agriculture, food\r\nproduction, environment and energy. In the latter sector\r\nin particular, this intergovernmental organization has\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nhelped set up a support programme for energy capability\r\nand transfer of technology in the area of new and\r\nrenewable sources of energy.\r\nAnother area in which the Agency has played a\r\nleading role is that of the environment; here the ACTC has\r\ncontributed to national environmental plans of action, to\r\nnatural-resources management, and to the management of\r\nnational parks and preserves.\r\nThe expansion and intensification of the Agency’s\r\nactivities have been designed to reflect its leadership’s\r\nconcern for efficiency and effectiveness, and aim to\r\nformalize cooperation with other regional and international\r\norganizations. Through that approach, the Agency has tried\r\nto avoid dissipation of its efforts, to benefit from\r\ncomplementarity among organizations dealing with similar\r\nor related issues, and thus to create the synergy needed for\r\nthe success of development programmes for the South, and\r\nfor the prospects for partnership among the States members\r\nof the Agency.\r\nIn that spirit, the ACTC has signed framework\r\nagreements with the Organization of African Unity,\r\ncovering such areas as the legal sphere and human rights.\r\nThe ACTC has joined with the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization in creating a support programme\r\nfor small agro-industrial enterprises in least-developed\r\ncountries. Moreover, the Agency has begun promising\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization and with the Islamic Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization. Those programmes\r\ninvolve the production of literacy material and the\r\ncofinancing of training operations. And along with the\r\nWorld Bank, the Agency has contributed to the financing\r\nof programmes in the areas of energy and the environment.\r\nDrawing on that experience, the Agency wishes now\r\nto expand its cooperation to justify the hopes placed upon\r\nit, by making its relationship with the United Nations an\r\nofficial one. As a founding member of the ACTC and as an\r\nactive participant among countries that share the French\r\nlanguage, Tunisia supports the formalization of cooperation\r\nbetween the Agency and the United Nations. The\r\ncooperation we wish to see between the two organizations\r\nis in keeping with the reforms the United Nations is\r\nundertaking towards involving regional institutions more\r\nclosely in its activities. The involvement of such institutions\r\nin development endeavours increases their responsibilities\r\nand could also reduce the heavy administrative and\r\nfinancial burden borne by the United Nations.\r\nThe ACTC, whose States members come from all\r\nfive continents, with their consequent wealth of culture\r\nand civilization, and whose peoples belong to both the\r\nNorth and the South, will certainly be able to make an\r\nactive contribution to the renewal of international\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): As this is my first statement before the General\r\nAssembly at this fiftieth session, let me begin, Sir, by\r\nsaying how pleased my delegation is to see you presiding\r\nover our work. We know your experience and personal\r\nqualities, and are certain that under your leadership our\r\nwork will yield positive results.\r\nFormalization of the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation (ACTC), which will be approved this\r\nmorning, could not be taking place at a more historic or\r\na more auspicious moment. The celebration in a few\r\ndays’ time of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations will mark the Organization’s coming of age, and\r\nwill also be an opportunity to lay the foundations for\r\nforms of international cooperation free from the\r\nideological confrontation of the past, and directed firmly\r\ntowards global challenges. These challenges include\r\neconomic and social development, strengthening\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights, promoting\r\nsustainable development while bearing in mind the need\r\nto protect the environment, fighting the scourge of drug\r\nabuse, and promoting equality for men and women.\r\nIt is fortunate that in all these areas the work of the\r\nUnited Nations has been supported by the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation, which has the same\r\nobjectives and defends the same ideals of peace and\r\ncooperation and understanding among peoples.\r\nEstablished on 20 March 1970 as a joint project of the\r\ncountries that use French as a common language, to\r\nestablish the expression of a new solidarity and an\r\nadditional factor for rapproachment between peoples by\r\na permanent dialogue of different cultures, the Agency\r\nhas always carried out its activities with due respect for\r\nthe identities of each of its members, while participating\r\nconstructively in the world dialogue. From Rio to Beijing,\r\nit has participated actively in the deliberations which led\r\nto the adoption of various programmes of action, and it\r\nencouraged participation by its members.\r\nThe Heads of State of the countries that use French\r\nas a common language, gathered together in the\r\nfrancophone community, decided at their recent Summit\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nin Mauritius to establish a new partnership with all the\r\ninstitutions that are members of the United Nations family,\r\nthereby emphasizing the complementarity between the\r\nUnited Nations and the francophone movement. In so\r\ndoing, they gave concrete expression to Chapters VIII and\r\nIX of the United Nations Charter, which encourages close\r\ncooperation between regional bodies and the United Nations\r\nin order to create the conditions of stability and prosperity\r\nneeded to ensure peaceful and friendly relations between\r\ncountries and thus maintain peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation plays a positive leading role within the\r\nfrancophone community by guiding multilateral cooperation\r\nbetween its members in areas of interest to the United\r\nNations, such as the place of law in the service of\r\ndevelopment and democracy, education and training, and\r\ntechnical cooperation in vital sectors, such as energy,\r\nscientific information and the environment.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, which has always\r\nbased its policy on dialogue and friendly agreement, can\r\nonly be proud to be involved in an initiative which\r\nencourages understanding between nations and peoples.\r\nBoth an Arab and an African country that has inherited\r\nmany different cultures, Mauritania feels at home in an\r\norganization which, respecting cultural diversity, advocates\r\nfruitful dialogue, to the benefit of all its members, for the\r\npreservation of peace and stability. This is why we are\r\nhappy to sponsor the draft resolution, and trust that it will\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Osseyi (Togo): My delegation is speaking on this\r\nagenda item in order to draw attention to the interest that\r\nthe Government of Togo takes in the activities of the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation and the\r\nimportance we attach to it as the one intergovernmental\r\norganization of the francophone world. I would also like to\r\nhighlight the capacity of the Agency, because of the nature\r\nof its activities, to contribute to resolving the political and\r\neconomic problems of the world today through a structural\r\npartnership with all the agencies that are members of the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nOn 27 October 1994, in Bucharest, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral told the Romanian Parliament:\r\n“The United Nations should ... be able to provide\r\nMember States with technical assistance to help them\r\nadapt their institutions, assist their citizens and train\r\ntheir personnel. It is vitally important to create\r\nindependent judiciaries, establish armies that respect\r\nthe rule of law, train police to be the guarantors of\r\npeople’s freedom, and to set up systems designed to\r\neducate the population in the field of human rights.”\r\nTo carry out this mission of peace throughout the\r\nworld, and particularly in the developing countries, it is\r\nclear that the United Nations system, however willing,\r\ncannot alone measure up to what is at stake and meet the\r\nchallenges the Organization faces. The United Nations\r\nalone cannot cope with the problems of all States, or\r\ngroups of States, and do the detailed elaboration of\r\nprogrammes to promote the desired development. It is\r\nessential to have the involvement of other structures,\r\nwhich I would describe as taking up the baton from the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation’s mandate is to maintain and develop\r\nmultilateral cooperation between its members in areas\r\nsuch as education and training, culture and\r\ncommunications, energy, the environment, agriculture,\r\neconomic development, economic information and the\r\npromotion of the rule of law, and we believe\r\nwholeheartedly that it is one of the agencies that can lend\r\nsupport to the United Nations.\r\nFor example, since the United Nations began its\r\nseries of conferences focusing on the essential aspects of\r\nchange and development at the global level, the Agency\r\nhas stood steadfastly at its side to help define the goals to\r\nbe sought. Beforehand, it prepared for the conferences by,\r\ninter alia, organizing meetings of the francophone\r\ncountries, either at the fringes of the preparatory\r\ncommittee meetings or on an ad hoc basis to harmonize\r\npositions, ensuring the participation in large numbers of\r\nfrancophone government representatives and\r\nrepresentatives of non-governmental organizations in the\r\nconferences and non-governmental organizations’ forums.\r\nAfterwards, the Agency contributed to the implementation\r\nin the francophone world of the programmes of action\r\nadopted by the conferences. For example, in the follow-up\r\nto the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, to\r\ngive just one example, the Agency was involved in\r\nproviding education and training in human rights for\r\nmagistrates, others involved in the administration of\r\njustice, educators and journalists. At the same time, it was\r\nactive in preparing, editing and distributing teaching\r\nmaterials on human rights, while supporting the processes\r\nof democratization and improving conditions for the\r\nadministration of justice.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nFor all these reasons, the Government of Togo, which\r\ngreatly appreciates the Agency’s support for development\r\nefforts in Togo, joined other Governments in calling for the\r\ninclusion on the agenda of the item entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation” and co-sponsored the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nWe did so because we are convinced that the United\r\nNations and the Agency share the same ideals and pursue\r\nthe same objectives of peace through human development,\r\nand that strengthening their cooperation by having close and\r\nregular relations can only speed up the attainment of these\r\nobjectives.\r\nMy delegation trusts that draft resolution A/50/L.4 will\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Moubarak (Lebanon) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): My delegation is pleased to be one of the sponsors\r\nof the draft resolution on the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation. Lebanon is one of the 37 member\r\nStates of the Agency, the intergovernmental organization of\r\nthe francophone movement, which is, above all, a meeting\r\npoint formed around an ideal. This year it celebrates its\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary, at a time when it is experiencing\r\nrenewed vigour.\r\nThe multilateral cooperation that the Agency seeks to\r\ndevelop among its members is broad-ranging, affecting\r\neducation, training, culture, communications, energy, the\r\nenvironment and much more. We believe that support for\r\neducational systems, the promotion of literacy, preservation\r\nof our heritage, the development of the creative potential of\r\naudiovisual products, support for national plans of action on\r\nthe environment, the management of national parks and\r\nother protected areas and inter-parliamentary cooperation\r\nare all matters that should be steadily developed and that\r\nhave an increasingly tangible and specific impact now that\r\nthe Agency is seeking to cooperate more fully and more\r\nsystematically with the United Nations system. As the\r\nAgency is increasingly involved in the United Nations\r\nsystem, its impact will be enhanced.\r\nThere is no question but that the francophone\r\nmovement plays an important role in the community of\r\nnations, both on the political level and on the cultural level.\r\nAnd, since 1990, we have seen the Agency playing a\r\ngrowing role in world conferences and summits organized\r\nby the United Nations. It is therefore natural for the\r\nAgency’s activities to be coordinated with those of the\r\nUnited Nations system and for there to be increased\r\ncooperation between the Agency, the United Nations and\r\nthe specialized agencies.\r\nLebanon is one of the Agency’s oldest and most\r\nactive members. It considers that the Agency performs a\r\nfunction which is fully in accord with the spirit and the\r\nletter of international life. Our delegation is therefore\r\nanxious to see the unanimous adoption of the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nWe should now be able to look forward to the\r\nAgency’s playing an increasing role in harmony with\r\ninternational programmes. Much is at stake. This means\r\na fresh start, rejuvenation. This interaction should succeed\r\nin harmonizing our complementarity and our differences\r\nto the benefit of the members of the Agency and of the\r\ninternational community. This is why we are eager to see\r\nthis objective achieved. We would convey once again to\r\nthe Permanent Observer of the Agency our best wishes\r\nand assure him of the full support of our delegation.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): In\r\naccordance with resolution 33/18 of 10 November 1978,\r\nI now call on the Observer for the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation.\r\nMr. Bouabid (Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation) (interpretation from French): This is the\r\nfirst time that, as Permanent Observer of the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation, I have spoken here\r\nin the General Assembly. I am particularly pleased to do\r\nso at an anniversary session of the General Assembly on\r\nan item concerning cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation. I am also particularly pleased to be doing so\r\nunder your presidency, Sir. I extend to you my warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of this\r\nparticularly important session of the General Assembly.\r\nYour personal qualities, your extensive knowledge of\r\ninternational relations and your considerable political\r\nexperience give us all good reason to expect a successful\r\noutcome to the work at this session under your guidance.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Côte d’Ivoire, and a distinguished member\r\nof the Ministerial Conference of the francophone\r\nmovement. The manner in which he presided over the last\r\nsession was appreciated by everyone.\r\nLastly, in this most memorable year in the life of the\r\nUnited Nations, I would like to extend to the Secretary-\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on\r\nbehalf of the Secretary-General of the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation, Mr. Jean-Louis Roy, and on my\r\nown personal behalf, a message of congratulations, support\r\nand commitment to him for his constant and tireless efforts\r\nat the head of this Organization to promote the goals of\r\nworld peace, security and development. These are the same\r\ngoals of peace and development sought by the francophone\r\ncommunity, grouped together within our organization, the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation. They are\r\nthe very foundation of the francophone ideal, as laid out by\r\nthe founders of the intergovernmental francophone\r\nmovement in Niamey in 1970, when they established the\r\nAgency.\r\nSince then, over 25 years, this idea has brought\r\nprogress extending to five continents. It brings together a\r\ncommunity of more than 400 million persons, in Europe,\r\nAfrica, America and Asia, with one common goal: to\r\nprovide a space for dialogue, cooperation and partnership\r\nwith total respect for diversity. Its unity is based on a\r\ncommunity of values and of language, devoted to the\r\npromotion of peace, justice, security, solidarity and\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, which are universal and inalienable.\r\nThese are the principles of the francophone movement,\r\nas strongly reconfirmed in the statement issued at the\r\nSummit of Heads of State and Government of countries that\r\nuse French as a common language, held in Mauritius in\r\nOctober 1993. It was at that same Summit that our Heads\r\nof State and Government, after studying the international\r\npolitical and economic situation and recognizing the\r\nimportance of multilateralism in the new international\r\ncontext, restated their desire to contribute actively to the\r\nsolution of the major political and economic problems of\r\ntoday’s world and to begin a new partnership with all the\r\norganizations that make up the United Nations family. At\r\nthe same time, they paid tribute to the historic role played\r\nby the United Nations and reiterated their full support for\r\nits Secretary-General, particularly in the implementation of\r\nthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.\r\nThey also defined a strategy for multilateral\r\ncooperation in the areas of development mentioned by\r\nmany earlier speakers: education and training, culture and\r\ncommunications, energy, the environment, agriculture, the\r\neconomy, scientific information and the strengthening of the\r\nState of law. They called on the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation to pursue and intensify its\r\ncooperation with international organizations, particularly the\r\nUnited Nations, in the implementation of the programmes\r\nmapped out for those fields. The francophone movement\r\nalso recalled that a common language can be a dynamic\r\nvehicle for exchange and cooperation and a catalyst for\r\nenriching world dialogue.\r\nAmong the duties assigned to the Agency by its\r\nstatutes is the responsibility of maintaining ties with\r\ninternational organizations involved in the same areas of\r\nactivity and of ensuring the greatest possible level of\r\nconsistency and viability in initiatives that are undertaken.\r\nIn that context, the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation has been represented at the European Union\r\nsince 1994. Very recently, a permanent observer office of\r\nthe Agency was also opened at the United Nations. This\r\noffice, which I have the honour to direct, is also\r\nresponsible for ensuring liaison with the World Bank and\r\nthe International Monetary Fund. These two new\r\narrangements strengthen our organization’s plans to\r\nensure permanent ties with international organizations, the\r\nfirst phase of which was the establishment in Geneva in\r\n1991 of representation at the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies in that city.\r\nThese recent actions are simply an extension of the\r\nAgency’s regular activities vis-à-vis the international\r\norganizations. These activities have two goals. The first\r\nis to offer our member countries responses that are more\r\nrelevant to their development needs through external\r\ntechnical and financial resources made available to them\r\njointly by the Agency and these organizations. The second\r\nis to ensure, in close cooperation with the authorities of\r\nthe countries concerned, the coordination of activities\r\nundertaken in a particular field by the Agency and other\r\norganizations. This would rationalize the measures they\r\ntake and avoid duplication and concentrate existing\r\nresources on specific targets.\r\nIn a world where the problems of development are\r\nwhat they are, particularly in the countries of the South,\r\nand where resources to address them are limited, logic\r\nand realism require synergy, rationalization, collaboration\r\nand solidarity.\r\nSpecific measures of cooperation undertaken in this\r\nspirit have been taken by the Agency with a number of\r\nother international organizations, including the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the\r\nIslamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,\r\nthe European Commission, the Indian Ocean Commission,\r\nthe African Development Bank and the World Bank. On\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nthe same model, we wish to develop our ties to the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe observer status which our Agency has enjoyed at\r\nthis Organization and the ever-increasing participation of\r\nthe francophone movement in world conferences organized\r\nby the United Nations have, I believe, been at the heart of\r\nthe promising relationship between our two organizations,\r\nparticularly in recent years. I should like to cite certain\r\nexperiences that highlight the complementarity of the\r\nactivities of the two organizations and, in some cases, the\r\nsynergy that has arisen.\r\nAt the Rio Summit on environment and development,\r\nthe countries using French as a common language\r\nparticipated as a group on the basis of a consensus reached\r\nat their conference of environment ministers organized by\r\nthe Agency in Tunis from 19 to 23 April 1991.\r\nDuring the preparations for the Summit, in order to\r\nfacilitate negotiations at the international level on two of\r\nthe most important items on the agenda, the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation carried out two studies\r\non financial resources and mechanisms and on transfers of\r\ntechnology for environment and sustainable development.\r\nThese two studies were submitted to the fourth session of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development as the\r\nfrancophone contribution to the work of the Rio Summit.\r\nAs for the follow-up to that Summit, the Agency made\r\navailable to its member States — and in particular the\r\ncountries of the South — small groups of governmental\r\nexperts to strengthen their participation in the work on the\r\nConventions on climate change, biodiversity and the\r\nstruggle against decertification and drought.\r\nThe second example I wish to cite concerns the\r\npreparations for, proceedings of and follow-up to the\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights. As part of the\r\npreparations for the Conference, the Agency organized, in\r\nLibreville in May 1993, a meeting of experts of its member\r\nStates, which produced an agreed francophone document\r\nthat was submitted to Vienna as the francophone\r\ncommunity’s contribution to the search for a world\r\nconsensus on the Conference’s final document.\r\nIn a statement he made in Brussels on 24 March 1994,\r\nFrancophone Day, the Secretary-General of the Conference,\r\nMr. Ibrahima Fall, said:\r\n“Through their active participation in the work\r\nof the Preparatory Committee of the Conference in\r\nApril 1993 in Geneva; through a special meeting of\r\nFrench-speaking human rights experts in Libreville\r\nin May 1993; and through the coordination of\r\ncollective participation by the francophone\r\ncommunity during the Conference itself, with the\r\nassistance of the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation, the representatives of the francophone\r\nStates made a significant contribution to the political\r\nand diplomatic success of Vienna and to the quality\r\nof the final document adopted by the Conference.”\r\nAs follow-up to the Conference, joint meetings with\r\nthe United Nations Centre for Human Rights allowed us\r\nto identify areas for cooperation between the Agency,\r\nthrough its general delegation for juridical and judiciary\r\ncooperation, and the United Nations for the\r\nimplementation in the francophone world of the plan of\r\naction adopted at the international level. Among relevant\r\nareas, I would mention the joint organization of training\r\nseminars for the preparation of national reports to be\r\nsubmitted by countries pursuant to international human\r\nrights conventions to which they are party; human rights\r\ntraining and education for magistrates, justice system\r\nadministrators, educators and journalists; the establishment\r\nof regional centres for human rights training; and the\r\nconception, publication and distribution of teaching aids\r\nfor human rights.\r\nI could also speak about the preparations for and\r\nproceedings of the recent World Conference in Beijing,\r\nwhere the francophone community had a stronger\r\npresence than at any other world conference. This was\r\nmentioned by the representative of Côte d’Ivoire. Three\r\nfollow-up activities are already planned jointly with the\r\nUnited Nations, including a seminar to be held in Bangui,\r\nCentral African Republic, in a few weeks — in\r\nNovember — on the drafting of national reports pursuant\r\nto the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women. But I prefer to emphasize\r\nother types of cooperation that have been undertaken with\r\nthe United Nations in the framework of our programme\r\nentitled \"Law in the service of development and\r\ndemocracy\", which should be one of the major axes of\r\nfuture cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nIn the area of election monitoring, the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation, acting pursuant to a\r\ndecision by the standing committee of the French-\r\nspeaking movement, has since 1993 sent about 25 election\r\nobservation missions to countries members of the French-\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 16 October 1995\r\nspeaking movement that had so requested. With only a few\r\nexceptions, those missions are always preceded by an\r\nexploratory mission to analyse the socio-political context\r\nand environment of the election, as well as any measures or\r\narrangements, whether structural or technical and legal, that\r\nmight be taken or which are already under way to prepare\r\nand organize the election, and then to collect all the texts\r\nand documents relating to it.\r\nThis is a very important area, where our two\r\nOrganizations should strengthen their cooperation further\r\nand act in close collaboration, both during the preparatory\r\nphase leading up to the election and during the actual\r\nholding of the election, in accordance with the model of the\r\nlegislative elections in Benin in March 1995, where true\r\ncoordination was achieved.\r\nIn Rwanda, in response to a request by the Rwandese\r\nauthorities to a number of international organizations,\r\nincluding the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation calling for action to support the establishment\r\nof a state of law and to aid national reconciliation, a joint\r\nmission of the Agency, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the United Nations Centre for\r\nHuman Rights was organized from 16 to\r\n22 November 1994 on the basis of agreed terms of\r\nreference. The report of that mission served as the basis for\r\nthe plan of action proposed to the round table of creditors\r\nof Rwanda organized at Geneva on 18 and\r\n19 January 1995.\r\nThe French-speaking movement, in coordination with\r\nUNDP and the Centre for Human Rights, provided support\r\nfor the arrangements by sending magistrates and human\r\nrights observers, as well as by supporting the work of the\r\nSpecial Rapporteur, in implementation of the plan of action.\r\nThese are just a few examples of the kind of pooling\r\nof resources that can result in benefits for Member States\r\nand promote the effectiveness of activities undertaken by\r\nthe various actors in multilateral cooperation. It is our\r\nhope that these examples will be strengthened, multiplied\r\nand broadened to all the activities and areas of common\r\ninterest between the United Nations and our Agency. This\r\nwas the desire of our Heads of State and Government, as\r\nhas been confirmed by the many delegations that have\r\nasked to speak on this agenda item at the current session,\r\nand which have also become sponsors of the relevant\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nI should like to extend to those delegations, as well\r\nas to all the member States of the French-speaking group,\r\nthe appreciation and thanks of the Secretary-General of\r\nthe Agency and on my own behalf for the statements they\r\nhave made this morning in favour of the actions and\r\noperations of the Agency, and for the active support they\r\nhave thus shown for strengthening the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation, thus injecting fresh vigour\r\ninto multilateral francophone and international\r\ncooperation. It is our hope that the Secretary-General, in\r\nthe report he is to submit to the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-second session in accordance with the draft\r\nresolution now under consideration, will be able to note\r\nsignificant progress in this area.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.4.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.4?\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.4 was adopted (resolution\r\n50/3).\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 157?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\n13\r\n"
