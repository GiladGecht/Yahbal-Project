(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/50/1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.5)\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of the\r\nUnited States of America to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.5.\r\nMr. Birenbaum (United States of America): The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization states many sound goals and objectives. In\r\nparticular, we agree with the goal of:\r\n“Reforming the United Nations into a simpler,\r\nmore focused and more integrated organization,\r\ncapable of pursuing the different aspects of its mission\r\nin a mutually reinforcing way and in the most efficient\r\nmanner possible, [which] has continued to be a key\r\nobjective”. (A/50/1, para. 18)\r\nAnd we support the Secretary-General’s management plan\r\n“to create a mission-driven and result-oriented\r\norganization.” (ibid., para. 17)\r\nWe believe that the work of the efficiency board will\r\nmake an important contribution to making the United\r\nNations work better and cost less.\r\nWe note that the Secretary-General’s report calls for\r\nserious consideration, in this the fiftieth-anniversary year\r\nof our Organization, of the future role and responsibilities\r\nof the United Nations. In that connection, my delegation\r\nhas been impressed by the level of commitment pledged\r\nby Members to the success of the recently created High-\r\nlevel Open-ended Working Group on the Strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations System. This Group has the mission\r\nof crafting a blueprint for strengthening, revitalizing and\r\nreforming the United Nations of the next era. We fully\r\nsupport this vital work.\r\nAs a contribution to the Secretariat’s efforts to\r\nimprove its services to delegations, we take this\r\nopportunity to introduce draft resolution A/50/L.5, entitled\r\n“Modalities for documentation”. This initiative is familiar\r\nto colleagues. It seeks to reverse the tide of\r\ndocumentation that is flooding the Organization. We have\r\nheard the Secretariat sound the alarm, calling the present\r\ncondition a “capacity crisis”. It might better be described\r\nas a “demand crisis” caused by an incessant and ever-\r\ngrowing demand for more and more meetings, transcripts\r\nand reports, at great cost and, too frequently, little gain to\r\nour Organization and its Member States.\r\nThe statistics are truly alarming. The Secretariat\r\nexpects to spend $295 million on producing documents in\r\nNew York and Geneva in the current biennium — a\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nsignificant increase on the figure for the previous period.\r\nYet who among us could claim that we are better informed\r\nand more enlightened by this vast volume of paper? Indeed,\r\nwho can claim to have read all these documents?\r\nThis crisis cannot be resolved without far greater\r\nrestraint on the part of Member States. As Ambassador\r\nAlbright has said,\r\n“Member States should take a vow to ask, before each\r\nreport that is ordered, each resolution proposed and\r\neach meeting scheduled, exactly what is the point: are\r\nwe breaking new ground, or are we spending more\r\nstaff resources and killing more trees just to say\r\nsomething that has already been said and translate it\r\ninto six official languages a hundred different times?”\r\nThe draft resolution would encourage Member States\r\nto restrain their demand for documentation and streamline\r\nthe material produced by the Secretariat. In particular, the\r\nSecretariat would be requested to provide orally an estimate\r\nof the cost of the relevant document before it is demanded\r\nby Member States, stricter page limits would be established,\r\noral reports would be encouraged, the Secretariat would be\r\nasked to consolidate reports on related topics, repetitive\r\nhistorical material would be eliminated and the use of\r\npaperless technology would be promoted.\r\nWe believe these measures will mean less cost but\r\nbetter and friendlier documentation. The Secretariat will be\r\nbetter able to comply with the six-week rule for the\r\ndistribution of documents in all official languages.\r\nWe bring this issue to the Assembly today because of\r\nthe importance we attach to this initiative. We recognize\r\nthat the Fifth Committee has special competence in these\r\nmatters and propose to refer the draft resolution to that\r\nCommittee for consideration this autumn. We look forward\r\nto working with all Members in that connection.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the next speaker, I\r\nshould like to propose, if there is no objection, that the list\r\nof speakers in the debate on this item be closed at 11 a.m.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I therefore request those\r\nrepresentatives wishing to participate in the debate to add\r\ntheir names to the list of speakers as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Yoogalingam (Malaysia): I would like to convey\r\nour appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report\r\ncontained in document A/50/1, entitled “Report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization”. The\r\nreport, submission of which is in compliance with Article\r\n98 of the Charter, provides a useful round-up of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations. Its timely submission this\r\nyear has enabled delegations to study, assess and\r\ncomment on it.\r\nLike last year’s report, this year’s report includes\r\nfive chapters: I, “Introduction”; II, “Coordinating a\r\ncomprehensive strategy”; III, ”The foundations of peace:\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian action and human rights”; IV,\r\n“Expanding preventive diplomacy and conflict\r\nresolution”; and V, “Conclusion”. The titles of this year’s\r\nchapters have remained essentially the same as last year’s,\r\nexcept that last year’s chapter V, entitled “Conclusion”,\r\nwas subtitled “A continuing commitment”. Unlike last\r\nyear’s 102-page document, this year’s report is 133 pages\r\nlong.\r\nIn poring over the document, it would be tempting\r\nfor many of us, faced with time constraints, to read only\r\nchapters I and V, the introduction and conclusion. These\r\ntwo chapters sketch in a nutshell the main activities of the\r\nUnited Nations and give an idea of the direction of the\r\nUnited Nations from the perspective of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Secretariat. By and large, the other three\r\nchapters delve into the details of the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in 1994.\r\nIn the first chapter, entitled “Introduction”, the report\r\nbegins with a focus on peace-keeping issues. This is\r\nevident when the Secretary-General talks of\r\n“the efforts of the Organization to respond\r\neffectively to the multitude of new demands and\r\nproblems resulting from the dramatic changes\r\nengendered by the end of the cold war”. (A/50/1,\r\npara. 5)\r\nHe then refers to\r\n“the immediate tasks arising from the outbreak of\r\nnew conflicts in different parts of the world and the\r\nresulting increase in demand for the Organization’s\r\npreventive, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-\r\nbuilding services”. (ibid.)\r\nThis chapter also acknowledges that\r\n“In the economic and social fields, as in the\r\npolitical, many areas of great concern remain where\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nthe United Nations has not, as yet, proved equal to the\r\nchallenge.” (ibid., para. 9)\r\nThe distinct accomplishments attained have been\r\novershadowed by the limited success of the United Nations\r\nin the area of development.\r\nOther issues covered in the introduction include\r\nfollow-up to the recent United Nations conferences, the\r\nneed for reform in the structures, methods and rules of the\r\nOrganization, the role of the United Nations in promoting\r\ndemocracy and the creation of a mission-driven and result-\r\noriented Organization.\r\nChapter I, together with Chapter V, entitled\r\n“Conclusion”, could be considered the executive summary\r\nof the report. Indeed, the report of the Secretary-General\r\nwould benefit from an executive summary.\r\nGiven the interest in reducing the length of documents\r\nas part of a set of cost-saving measures, we wish to state\r\nthat these reports, as mandated in the Charter, should not be\r\nsubjected to such considerations. To my delegation, the\r\nquality of the report should take precedence over its length.\r\nWe also wish to recall our observation of last year in\r\nwhich we underlined that the report should critique the\r\nsuccesses and failures of the Organization. Such a critique\r\nwould have contributed towards a qualitative assessment of\r\nthe effectiveness of this unique intergovernmental\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn the final chapter, entitled “Conclusion”, the\r\nSecretary-General has attempted to address future directions\r\nwhile pointing out fundamental problems. He has cited\r\nthree immediate problems which, if not effectively\r\naddressed, could cause irreparable damage to the United\r\nNations as a mechanism for progress. Briefly stated, the\r\nthree problems are, first, the need to respect the safety and\r\nintegrity of United Nations personnel in the field; secondly,\r\nthe need to place the financial situation of the Organization\r\non a sound and secure footing; and, thirdly, the need for a\r\nnew vision for development, taking into account the current\r\nsituation, in which funds for development are drying up.\r\nThe Assembly, through its open-ended working\r\ngroups, remains seized of all these problems, especially the\r\nfinancing of the United Nations and matters relating to\r\ndevelopment. On the issue of the safety of United Nations\r\npersonnel, it will be recalled that last year the Assembly\r\nadopted a Convention to protect United Nations personnel.\r\nWhile my delegation will elaborate on these and\r\nother, related issues during the meetings of the relevant\r\nopen-ended working groups, I would like to emphasize\r\nhere that it is time for this Organization to look at other,\r\nindependent means of financing, rather than depending\r\nmerely on contributions from States. It is wholly\r\nunacceptable that Members, especially the rich ones,\r\nshould fall into arrears and yet exercise special rights.\r\nChapters II, III and IV go in detail into the various\r\nactivities undertaken by the United Nations, from peace-\r\nkeeping, development, human rights and democratization\r\nto matters pertaining to the Secretariat.\r\nIn Chapter II, entitled “Coordinating a\r\ncomprehensive strategy”, the section dealing with the\r\nGeneral Assembly includes facts such as these: the\r\nagenda for the forty-ninth session comprised 164 items,\r\ncompared with 180 items in the previous session; the\r\nGeneral Committee and the Main Committees held 377\r\nmeetings, as compared with a total of 401 during the\r\nforty-eighth session and 426 during the forty-seventh\r\nsession; and through August 1995 the Assembly had\r\nadopted 324 resolutions, compared with 333 at the\r\nprevious session.\r\nWhile such details regarding the work of the General\r\nAssembly are helpful, it would also be interesting to be\r\ngiven statistics on the types of meetings held and\r\nresolutions and statements adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil. This would give us all a sense of the workload\r\nof both organs, one where sovereign equality prevails and\r\nthe other where 15 Member States alone are involved.\r\nThe comparison would be useful to counter the notion\r\nthat the general debate in the General Assembly and the\r\ndesire of delegations to pronounce themselves on an issue\r\nthrough the adoption of a resolution should be curtailed\r\nas an ostensible cost-saving measure. When all is said and\r\ndone, the General Assembly, particularly during the\r\ngeneral debate, remains the only universal\r\nintergovernmental forum where our leaders can clearly\r\nstate their views without fear of reprisal. We must ensure\r\nthat our leaders’ fundamental right of expression is\r\nsafeguarded.\r\nOn the report’s remarks in paragraph 38 pertaining\r\nto the challenges to the Secretariat resulting from the\r\nproliferation of issue-specific open-ended working groups,\r\nMalaysia wishes to stress the need to avoid duplication\r\nand to ensure consistency. Who provides the overview of\r\nand macroperspective on the various issues discussed in\r\nthese working groups, which obviously have cross-\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nlinkages? Why are non-governmental organizations\r\nwelcome in some working groups and refused participation\r\nin others, such as the working group dealing with reform of\r\nthe Security Council?\r\nOn the issue of the Trusteeship Council, Malaysia\r\nshares the view that the organ should be eliminated, since\r\nthe Council has completed the task entrusted to it under the\r\nCharter. As we collectively address reform of the\r\nmultilateral system, appropriate changes in this connection\r\ncould be made.\r\nStill in Chapter II, the report dwells at length on the\r\nsteps taken to create a mission-driven and result-oriented\r\nOrganization. Malaysia’s position was succinctly stated in\r\nits Prime Minister’s address to the General Assembly:\r\n“Reform of the United Nations also requires the\r\ncleansing of the bureaucratic Augean stables in the\r\nSecretariat. The morale of the international civil\r\nservice is at its lowest ebb. The excesses and the fat\r\nmust be trimmed, but failure to do so must not be\r\nused as an excuse for not paying dues or for opting\r\nout”. (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 12th meeting, p. 4)\r\nOn Chapter III, “The foundations of peace:\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian action and human rights”,\r\nMalaysia agrees fully with the statement\r\n“that development should be recognized as the\r\nforemost and most far-reaching task of our time”.\r\n(A/50/1, para. 182)\r\nThis chapter deals with the gamut of issues covered by the\r\nSecond and Third Committees relating to economic growth\r\nand development. The style of its section E, entitled “The\r\nhumanitarian imperative”, unlike the generally narrative\r\nstyle of the rest of Chapters II, III and IV, is incisive,\r\nproviding food for thought for all delegations. In paragraph\r\n474, for instance, the report notes the linkage between the\r\nscale and depth of suffering in conflict situations and\r\ndisregard for fundamental humanitarian principles. The\r\nreport adds that\r\n“In many instances, the suffering endured by civilians\r\nis not an incidental element of political and military\r\nstrategies but constitutes its major objective. The\r\nconflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda are\r\nalarming examples of what occurs when civilians are\r\nsubjected to the full brutality of contemporary warfare\r\nand gross violations of human rights. Determination\r\nmust be shown to enforce the rule of law and to\r\nhold accountable those who are responsible for\r\nheinous crimes”. (A/50/1, para. 474)\r\nThis is an instance of the report’s making a point of\r\nindicating how an issue could be handled.\r\nChapter IV, “Expanding preventive diplomacy and\r\nconflict resolution”, is essentially devoted to United\r\nNations peace-keeping activities. Malaysia has been\r\nconsistently active in United Nations peace-keeping\r\nactivities and remains one of the major troop-contributing\r\ncountries. An area of concern pertains to consultations\r\nbetween the troop contributors and the Security Council.\r\nDespite the statement issued by the President of the\r\nSecurity Council on 4 November 1994, consultations\r\nremain ad hoc. Consistent with Article 44 of the Charter,\r\nit is time for such consultations to be regularized. We\r\nlook forward to elaborating on our position during the\r\nforthcoming Special Political and Decolonization\r\nCommittee (Fourth Committee) debate on matters relating\r\nto all aspects of peace-keeping.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of\r\nthe Organization is critical to our debate and our\r\nconsequent actions. While we must take stock of the\r\nactivities of the preceding year, it is equally, if not more,\r\nimportant that we benefit from the experience in the\r\nfuture. A revitalized United Nations, including a\r\nrestructured and democratic Security Council, must be\r\ngeared to face the challenges of the next century. It must\r\npromote a common agenda in the collective interest of all\r\nof us.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The item entitled “Report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization” is, in our\r\nopinion, one of the most important of the current session.\r\nWe therefore thank the Secretary-General for his work in\r\nthat regard.\r\nOn the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the Organization, new universal questions\r\narise more emphatically than ever before: what will be the\r\nobjectives and priorities of the United Nations in the face\r\nof the urgent problems challenging mankind? What will\r\nbe the precepts, powers and competence of the\r\ninternational Organization that emerged from the will of\r\nsovereign States and is called on to carry out joint action\r\non the basis of common credos and principles?\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nIt would be impossible to cover in a single statement\r\nthe wide spectrum of topics contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General; therefore, we would like to focus on\r\nthose which my delegation believes to be of fundamental\r\nimportances, both conceptually and practically.\r\nThe Secretary-General states that the Organization is\r\ncalled upon to give an effective response to the number of\r\nnew demands and problems resulting from the dramatic\r\nchanges associated with the end of the cold war. In this\r\nregard, he underlines the “increase in demand for the\r\nOrganization’s preventive peacemaking, peace-keeping and\r\npeace-building (A/50/1, para. 5) while reiterating that “the\r\nUnited Nations remained determined to pay more attention\r\nto the foundations of peace, not least those lying in the\r\nrealm of economic and social development”. (A/50/1,\r\npara. 6)\r\nIn the spirit of giving an accurate interpretation of the\r\nassertions made by the Secretary-General, we have tried to\r\nfind compatibility between the contraposition peace-\r\ndevelopment, which is the translation of the language of\r\nthat statement, and the assertions contained in the report on\r\nthe work of the Organization presented to the Assembly at\r\nits forty-ninth session, in which the Secretary-General\r\nseemed to be determined, first of all, to correct\r\n“the widespread misperception of the United Nations\r\nas an organization dedicated primarily to peace-\r\nkeeping”. (A/49/1, para. 1)\r\nWe could agree on the fact that the turbulent and\r\ndramatic developments which have shaken some areas of\r\nthe planet, or the everyday attempts against the well-being\r\nof peoples, against human rights and the very dignity of\r\nhuman beings in other parts of the world have given rise to\r\na unanimous call for peace. However, many of these\r\ndevelopments have a common factor: the economic and\r\nsocial problems affecting almost all of humanity. In this\r\nsense, the binomial peace-development, the interrelation\r\nbetween the terms, not their contraposition, and the crucial\r\nimportance of “development” could not be overlooked.\r\nConsequently, if the reading or the message of the\r\nSecretary-General were different, they would differ\r\nessentially from the statements contained in the report\r\nsubmitted at the forty-ninth session, which were\r\nacknowledged and commended by the Cuban delegation.\r\nAs to the work of the Organization on the elaboration\r\nand adoption of an “Agenda for Development”, the Cuban\r\ndelegation has carefully read the particular reference to\r\nCuba in this year’s report of the Secretary-General, as well\r\nas the contribution and support offered to this\r\ncommitment by important documents such as the Halifax\r\ncommuniqué of June 1995. Actually, the developing\r\ncountries, for which “an agenda for development” is a\r\npriority, appreciate any contribution aimed at promoting\r\nthe adoption and implementation of such a global\r\ndirective; but, from the very moment of its inception, the\r\ndeveloping countries have clearly defined the priorities\r\nand dimensions of that future agenda. We hope that the\r\noffers to assist us in the achievement of this goal and the\r\nsincere and voluntary willingness to give\r\n“a fresh approach to international cooperation and to\r\ndefine the particular contribution expected of United\r\nNations bodies” (A/50/1, para. 12)\r\nto that Agenda would be compatible with the priorities\r\nand dimensions attributed to development by the\r\ndeveloping countries themselves.\r\nThroughout the report, reference is made to the need\r\nto restructure the Organization. This is based on the view\r\nthat it would be necessary to reform “the United Nations\r\ninto a simpler, more focused and more integrated\r\norganization”. (A/50/1, para. 18) The orientation and\r\nintegrity of the objectives and actions of the Organization\r\nare undoubtedly a result of the fundamental interest and\r\nrelevance in the necessary process of reforms.\r\nWe support all efforts aimed at making the United\r\nNations a more efficient and effective organization that\r\ncould respond to the decisions and interests of all its\r\nMember States. We think that every process of reform\r\nshould be carried out with the appropriate participation\r\nand prior approval of the Member States, taking as an\r\nessential principle full implementation of the mandates\r\nadopted by the General Assembly. Only then will the\r\ncredibility and validity of that process be assured.\r\nThe success of reform will be mostly based, as\r\nexpected, on the financial stability of the Organization,\r\nwhich will depend, first and foremost, on the fulfilment\r\nby all Member States of their obligations under Article 19\r\nof the Charter. Unconditional payment by the major\r\ncontributor will also be essential to the achievement of\r\nsuch financial stability. The rational and efficient use of\r\nresources will also contribute to more effective\r\naccomplishment of the tasks incumbent on the\r\nOrganization. However, saving could not be, in any way,\r\nthe goal of the United Nations, but rather the means to\r\nbetter achieve its objectives. Thus, the path towards\r\nefficiency should not interfere with the mandates, the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\npurposes and principles, or the universal character of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nPeace-keeping operations have increased in number\r\nand complexity. However, today, as never before, the\r\nprinciples invoked by the international community, namely,\r\nthe consent of the parties in conflict as an essential\r\ncondition for the establishment of a peace-keeping\r\noperation; and respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity\r\nand political independence of States, as well as non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, inter alia,\r\ncontinue to be extremely relevant principles. Agreements on\r\nthe status of peace-keeping forces should be a faithful\r\nexpression of the consent, the will and the disposition of\r\nthe Member States concerned to pay their contributions. As\r\nindicated by recent experience, the maintenance of peace\r\ntogether with acts of coercion is not the proper response\r\nwhen the consent or cooperation of the parties in conflict\r\ndoes not exist. In our opinion the United Nations can be\r\nefficient only as long as the Member States allow it to be.\r\nThe Security Council should never be the umbrella\r\ncovering unilateral decisions of States or groups of States\r\nto intervene in situations which are exclusively within the\r\ninternal jurisdiction of States.\r\nA few days ago in this General Assembly Hall we\r\napproved the allocation of items to the various Committees\r\nand the plenary General Assembly. In that allocation, as is\r\nour tradition, item 119: “Pattern of Conferences” was\r\nassigned to the Fifth Committee. We are all aware that the\r\ndebate on that item is based on the report of the Committee\r\non Conferences, a subsidiary body of the Fifth Committee.\r\nAt this very time, that main Committee is also considering\r\nthe item on “Programme planning”. Also by a decision on\r\nthe part of Member States, the Fifth Committee has been\r\nentrusted with analysing administrative and budgetary\r\nquestions. Furthermore, it is important to note the\r\nprovisions of General Assembly resolution 46/220, which\r\nrefers in its annex to the consideration of programme\r\nplanning as part of our search for efficiency and improved\r\nuse of resources.\r\nWe are all aware that this year we must also consider\r\nthe control and limitation of documentation. My delegation\r\nhas taken note of the submission of draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.5 and is prepared to consider it in the Fifth\r\nCommittee under the appropriate item.\r\nOur comments on the report of the Secretary-General\r\nfor this period could be extensive and numerous. We agree\r\non many aspects and appreciate the accuracy and depth of\r\nmany of his approaches. There are also areas of\r\ndisagreement, such as the Secretary-General’s approach to\r\nitems such as development, the process of reform and\r\nrestructuring of the system, and the assessment of the\r\nnature, mandate and objectives of a number of bodies of\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nHowever, beyond the differences, my country offers\r\na flexible readiness and a constructive spirit in favour of\r\ndialogue and negotiation among Member States to attain\r\nfair, essential and long-lasting solutions aimed not only at\r\nidentifying and uniting our actions and objectives, but\r\nalso at rescuing and realizing through just, necessary\r\ninternational action the universal character of the\r\nOrganization and its essential goal: to contribute to the\r\nwell-being of mankind.\r\nMr. de Silva (Sri Lanka): On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Sri Lanka, I would like to express our\r\nappreciation for the thoroughness with which the\r\nSecretary-General has prepared his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization. I am pleased to express our sense of\r\nsatisfaction with the account of the work of the United\r\nNations as detailed in that report. We congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General on its comprehensiveness, its clarity of\r\nexposition and its balanced evaluation of the work of the\r\nOrganization in the manifold fields of activity undertaken\r\nduring the last year. We shall, however, reserve our\r\ndetailed comments on specific questions that are of\r\nspecial concern to us for when they come up for\r\ndiscussion under the relevant agenda items, and shall\r\ncontent ourselves, for the present, with certain general\r\nobservations upon a broad survey of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations in the context of the international scene.\r\nThe wave of euphoria that marked the end of the\r\ncold war at the beginning of this decade appears to have\r\nreceded as swiftly as it swept upon us. A mood of\r\napprehensiveness tinged with misgivings has overtaken us.\r\nWe stand exposed to the harsh realities of a host of new\r\nconflicts that have proved to be quite intractable. They\r\nhave made, and continue to make, heavy demands on the\r\nservices of the United Nations in peacemaking,\r\npeace-keeping and peace-building.\r\nThe financial cost of these new demands has proved\r\nto be a severe strain upon an Organization which had\r\nalready reached a critical point in respect of its financial\r\nviability. A cloud of pessimism and dark foreboding for\r\nthe future arose as a result of the disastrous events in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia. But,\r\nfortunately, the story is not one of unmitigated disaster.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nOur faith in the Organization has to some extent been\r\nredeemed by its modest successes in Cambodia,\r\nMozambique, El Salvador and Angola; this is surely cause\r\nfor hope and thankfulness and strengthens our determination\r\nto succeed in our future endeavours.\r\nAt the same time, we remind ourselves of the ever-\r\npresent need to secure the foundation for a durable peace,\r\nwhich lies in the economic and social sphere that\r\nperennially cries out for attention but which is often\r\ndrowned out by more strident voices demanding attention\r\nfor causes more sensational. We cannot but endorse the\r\nSecretary-General’s emphasis on the less spectacular work\r\nof the United Nations and its agencies in this field of vital\r\nactivity, and express the fervent hope that the ongoing\r\ndiscussions on “An Agenda for Development” will finally\r\nyield fruitful results.\r\nWe are heartened by the new impetus given to the\r\ncore issues of development, poverty, unemployment and\r\nsocial disintegration by the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment at Copenhagen and wait with great\r\nexpectation for the eventual outcome of the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, held in Beijing, which has just been\r\nconcluded. We consider this to have been an epoch-making\r\nevent affecting all women, who constitute nearly half the\r\npeople of this Earth.\r\nThis year’s report of the Secretary-General appears at\r\nfirst sight to highlight the fact that, despite the foundational\r\nconcerns of the United Nations, which are of universal and\r\nperennial interest to all Member States — namely the\r\neconomic, social and humanitarian work of the\r\nOrganization, which is an ongoing enterprise — what has\r\ngripped public attention and often evoked critical comment\r\nhas been the high-visibility efforts of the United Nations in\r\nthe field of preventing, containing and resolving\r\ninternational conflicts. But, as a corrective to this approach,\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report also underscores the broadly\r\npervasive nature of the regular and steady work of the\r\nUnited Nations and its multifaceted character that is ever\r\nresponsive to the changes that are taking place around us.\r\nThis aspect of the report needs to be borne in mind for a\r\nfair and correct assessment of the work of the Organization.\r\nThis indeed is a realistic approach which, at the same time,\r\nhelps to strengthen inspire and renew our commitment to\r\nthe noble ideals of the United Nations during this fiftieth\r\nanniversary, which is a time for reflection and thought and\r\nnot merely self-congratulation.\r\nWe are indeed happy to observe the note of optimism\r\nsounded in the report when the Secretary-General refers to\r\nthe new spirit and momentum that are gathering in the\r\ninternational community, which will revitalize and\r\nre-energize the Organization as we enter this landmark\r\nyear for the United Nations. We express the hope that it\r\nwill infuse all its work in the future. We also share the\r\nhopes of the Secretary-General on the efforts to make the\r\nUnited Nations an institution that is\r\n“more intellectually creative, more financially\r\nstable, more managerially effective and more\r\nresponsive to all sectors of society”. (A/50/1,\r\npara. 992)\r\nWe also welcome the spirit of realism that is struck\r\nby the report when it cautions us of the need to take note\r\nof institutional weaknesses and failed enterprises. These\r\nare the consequences of inadequate attention and care\r\nbeing paid to framing the mandates issued by organs of\r\nthe United Nations, which often lack clarity. These\r\nfailures are also due to the paucity and meagre quality of\r\nthe financial and material resources available to the\r\nOrganization and, not least, to the failure of its Member\r\nStates to comply with the obligations of membership,\r\nwhich are both imperative and mandatory for its\r\nsuccessful working. Concurrently with the globalization of\r\nthe activities of the United Nations, it is but natural that\r\ninstitutional weaknesses and flawed structures of the\r\nOrganization will become more evident and will increase\r\nin scale. It has also to some extent generated and\r\ncontinues to generate a syndrome of fear and isolationism.\r\nThese are of course highly detrimental to the interests of\r\nthe United Nations, and even have destructive potential\r\nfor the future. They need our immediate and urgent\r\nattention.\r\nWe are indeed appreciative of the candour and sense\r\nof realism that characterize the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nI have no doubt that there will be general agreement that\r\nit is our duty and responsibility to grasp the full impact of\r\nits observations and address ourselves to the remedial\r\naction that we must assuredly embark upon if we are\r\nconcerned about the future of this Organization. The one\r\ncompelling message that emerges from this report, which\r\nmust be crystal clear to all of us, is the paramount need\r\nto preserve and perpetuate this hallowed institution as the\r\nonly instrument and mechanism for the security and\r\nbetterment of mankind. We therefore support the\r\nwidespread calls for reform of the United Nations in order\r\nto make it a more effective instrument for the realization\r\nof the ideals that inspired its foundation half a century\r\nago. There is no need to add that this must be on the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nbasis of a general consensus, which must emerge through\r\ndiscussion and debate.\r\nWe support the establishment of an open-ended high-\r\nlevel working group of the General Assembly that would\r\nundertake a thorough review of all relevant United Nations\r\nmaterials, taking into account the submissions made by\r\nMember States and the resources of knowledge and analysis\r\nmade available through the various independent studies and\r\nreports relating to the revitalization, strengthening and\r\nreform of the United Nations system.\r\nAny State that has the future existence and welfare of\r\nthe United Nations at heart must surely take cognizance of\r\nthe three serious problems to which the Secretary-General\r\nhas drawn attention in paragraphs 1002 to 1004 of his\r\nreport. They are, first, the safety and integrity of United\r\nNations personnel in the various missions that have been\r\nundertaken. We cannot allow a situation in which those\r\nengaged in peace-keeping or in humanitarian missions find\r\ntheir lives and safety endangered. The second problem is\r\nthe deteriorating financial situation of the Organization;\r\npractical steps have to be taken to reverse this trend. The\r\nthird is the dwindling resources being made available for\r\ndevelopment, a situation that is aggravated by the\r\nincreasing demands made on account of peace-keeping.\r\nSustainable human development is the life-blood of all\r\nnations and unless we ensure that it becomes a reality, a\r\nbleak future awaits us at the dawn of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nIn conclusion may I, on behalf of my delegation, once\r\nagain express our grateful thanks for this invaluable study\r\nand survey of the events that have occurred and issues that\r\nhave arisen since the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are supportive of the Secretary-General’s efforts to\r\nstreamline the Organization to ensure greater efficiency. We\r\nhope that the more pressing reforms will be put in place\r\nexpeditiously and that they will contribute to the effective\r\nmanagement of the Organization.\r\nMr. Rowe (Australia): We wish to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nand forward-looking report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. The report demonstrates clearly the\r\nchallenges and opportunities which continue to face the\r\nUnited Nations in an increasingly complex global\r\nenvironment. It also outlines the significant action that has\r\nbeen taken in many areas over the past year to strengthen\r\nthe role and functioning of the Organization to respond\r\neffectively to those challenges and opportunities, to realize\r\nfully the goals embodied in the Charter. We commend the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and the staff of the\r\nSecretariat for their commitment to achieving this\r\nobjective.\r\nThe Secretary-General notes that there continues to\r\nbe a widespread misperception of the United Nations as\r\nan Organization dedicated primarily to peace-keeping.\r\nThis is, however, as the Secretary-General points out,\r\nonly part — but a vitally important one — of the picture.\r\nThe United Nations has an equally vital role to play in\r\nstrengthening the foundations of peace through giving\r\nmore attention to economic and social development.\r\nThe past few turbulent years of the United Nations\r\nexperience on the ground in peace-keeping and peace\r\nenforcement have underlined the need for it to improve\r\nthe effectiveness of its work in these important fields.\r\nAustralia has therefore welcomed the Secretary-General’s\r\nfurther work in this area in his very lucid 1995\r\nSupplement to “An Agenda for Peace”. In our own\r\ncontributions to the debates on these issues, we have\r\nargued for the clearest possible thinking to be given to the\r\nachievability of objectives right across the whole\r\nspectrum of responses to security problems, from peace-\r\nbuilding to peace-maintenance to peace-restoration to\r\npeace-enforcement.\r\nWe have consistently argued also that, if the United\r\nNations is to be able to meet effectively the security\r\nchallenges of the post-cold-war world, it must begin to\r\ndevote more resources to preventive strategies than to\r\nreactive strategies. It makes more sense to concentrate on\r\nprevention than on after-the-event peace restoration, both\r\nfor inter-State conflict and in the, unhappily, now far\r\nmore common case of intra-State conflict. We are\r\ntherefore pleased to note the measures which the\r\nSecretary-General has taken to strengthen the Secretariat’s\r\npreventive diplomacy capacity, including coordination.\r\nWe also commend the Secretary-General’s undertaking to\r\nredouble his efforts in the preventive diplomacy field.\r\nThe United Nations should also always be prepared\r\nto lend its support and encouragement to preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking efforts taking place outside\r\nthe formal framework of the United Nations system, such\r\nas we have seen recently in relation to the former\r\nYugoslavia and the Middle East, and should remain\r\nparticularly alert to the opportunities envisaged in the\r\nCharter for advancing the peace agenda through regional\r\norganizations. In this context, we in the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion have been pleased with the rapid evolution of the\r\nRegional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nNations over the past two years as a new vehicle for\r\ndialogue, and trust- and confidence-building in our own\r\nregion.\r\nWhile the security agenda tends to dominate most\r\npopular perceptions of the United Nations role, we in the\r\ninternational community must never allow our attention to\r\nbe diverted from the demands of the development agenda,\r\nnow as pressing as ever.\r\nThe United Nations of the future must, as a matter of\r\nthe most urgent priority, forge a new agenda for\r\ndevelopment and reshape its relevant institutions to\r\nimplement that agenda effectively. This is as important as\r\nany task it faces in the service of the human family, and in\r\nrecreating itself as an institution fit for the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The agenda is available for all to see. It has been\r\nfully described in the six global Conferences held by the\r\nUnited Nations in the last four years — the Conferences on\r\nchildren, the environment, human rights, population, social\r\ndevelopment and women. There have also been important\r\nstudies by the international financial institutions and by\r\nacademic institutions. We know now what we need to do.\r\nWe must therefore resolve, politically, to do it.\r\nFor these reasons, Australia welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s “An Agenda for Development”, following on as\r\nit does from “An Agenda for Peace”. Among other\r\nimportant considerations, it fully recognizes the relationship\r\nbetween peace and development, acknowledging that\r\nequitable development eradicates many of the socio-political\r\nconditions in which threats to peace breed. And, very\r\nimportantly, it places emphasis on individual human beings\r\nas the subjects and beneficiaries of our developmental\r\nefforts. It recognizes that economies should serve people.\r\nWe also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has\r\nplaced on practical international cooperation for global\r\nhuman security, for example, in the areas of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance, effective governance and the key\r\nsocial issues which formed the agenda of the World\r\nSummit on Social Development.\r\nA more integrated effort will clearly be required of the\r\nUnited Nations system if the objectives set out in “An\r\nAgenda for Development” are to be achieved. It is\r\nimperative that we improve the system’s ability to develop\r\nand implement social and economic development\r\nprogrammes in a more coordinated and coherent manner,\r\nincluding by finding ways to allow the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and United Nations bodies to work in closer\r\nharmony.\r\nIn pursuing these various themes it is important,\r\nhowever, for us not to lose sight of those geographic\r\nregions where particular focus is still required, and where\r\nthe United Nations role is more vital than ever. Africa’s\r\ninfluence and importance continue to be felt throughout\r\nthe world in every field of human activity and culture.\r\nExciting political developments, including the ending of\r\napartheid, have been accompanied by major new efforts\r\nto restructure and reform national economies; those efforts\r\ndemand the continued support of the international\r\ncommunity, and in particular the United Nations system.\r\nOther regions where the United Nations needs to play a\r\nparticular role to facilitate economic and social\r\ndevelopment are the Central Asian Republics, the Middle\r\nEast, the Caribbean, and in a number of areas in the\r\nIndian Ocean region.\r\nThe institutions of the United Nations relevant to\r\neconomic and social development are urgently in need of\r\nreform, as is reflected in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThe General Assembly has created the High-level\r\nWorking Group needed for political consensus on this. It\r\nmust complete its work in this fiftieth anniversary year,\r\nand it must do so creatively, setting aside past vested\r\ninterests in the system. We must implement the\r\ndevelopment agenda of the future in a way which ensures\r\na productive and fair place in the global economy for all\r\nStates.\r\nNo agendas of substance, no matter how clear in\r\nconcept and well-coordinated in principle they may be,\r\nwill mean anything to people if they cannot be\r\nimplemented through effective organizational structures\r\nand instruments. There has been widespread recognition\r\nin recent years that the structure of the United Nations\r\nthat has grown up during the last 50 years is simply not\r\nadequate to the tasks of the next fifty.\r\nWe now have an embarrassment of riches with\r\nrespect to ideas and proposals for change to the United\r\nNations Organization, some of which are referred to in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report. Just as it is urgent that we\r\ncomplete work on “An Agenda for Development” in this\r\nfiftieth year, it is equally urgent that we complete the\r\nwork of the High-level Working Group on the reform of\r\nthe United Nations system, also within the fiftieth year.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for having\r\ninitiated a management plan with five objectives which,\r\nif realized, would undoubtedly go a long way to\r\nreforming the United Nations and producing the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\n“simpler, more focused and more integrated\r\norganization, capable of pursuing the different aspects\r\nof its mission in a mutually reinforcing way and in the\r\nmost efficient manner possible” (A/50/1, para. 18),\r\nwhich Australia has long advocated.\r\nWe also endorse strongly the Secretary-General’s\r\ncommitment to achieving a more adequate and reliable\r\nfinancial base for the Organization. Not only do we have a\r\nshort-term financial problem, we have a longer-term\r\nproblem, which requires new approaches. In this regard, as\r\nSenator Evans, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nsaid in his general debate statement on 2 October 1995,\r\n“it is time to look again — this time very seriously\r\nindeed — at the options which exist for supplementing\r\nMember States’ contributions with external sources of\r\nfinance” (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 15th meeting,\r\np. 15.)\r\nsuch as through levies on foreign exchange transactions and\r\non international air travel.\r\nThe Secretary-General observes in his report that the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is an occasion to\r\naddress ways to regain that momentum in world affairs that\r\nappeared so dramatically at the outset of this decade.\r\nWe agree, and the United Nations has a crucial role to\r\nplay in regaining this momentum. For it to do so\r\neffectively, the United Nations of the future will need to be\r\nan Organization which works and speaks for all its\r\nMembers, no matter how large or small, and whose\r\nlegitimacy is thus without question. It must be an\r\nOrganization better oriented to performance, to delivery to\r\npeople of the things they need and have a right to expect.\r\nAnd it must be an Organization which seeks to\r\nreintegrate, and better coordinate, the implementation of the\r\nthree basic United Nations objectives so clearly articulated\r\nat San Francisco 50 years ago — the objectives of peace\r\n(meeting the need for security), development (meeting\r\neconomic needs) and human rights and justice (meeting the\r\nneed for individual and group dignity and liberty).\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report is evidence, and\r\nencouragement, that we recognize what needs to be done,\r\nthat we are making progress in reshaping the Organization\r\nfor the twenty-first century, but that much still remains to\r\nbe done. We must keep up the momentum.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): First of all I would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on what he\r\nrightly called a “landmark year”. Like preceding speakers,\r\nwe agree with the emphasis he has placed on the need for\r\nreforms. The United Nations has reached a crossroads\r\nwhere we have to decide whether we need and whether\r\nwe want a United Nations capable of meeting the\r\nchallenges not only of the next century, but even of\r\ntoday. In our discussions we too often lose sight of these\r\nfundamental questions, get lost in minuscule problems and\r\nhave difficulty in finding a way out.\r\nLet me start with the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThis work did not begin because one country or another\r\nwanted changes, but because there was a consensus that\r\nneither the composition nor the working methods of the\r\npresent Council corresponded any longer to the changes\r\nin the United Nations, its membership and tasks. That is\r\nwhy we all agreed in the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group that the Council should be expanded and\r\nits working methods reviewed — a view which was\r\nshared by the Council itself in the statement it issued to\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. And, last but not least, the statements in this\r\nyear’s general debate have shown that a great majority of\r\nStates consider the reform of the Security Council an\r\nurgent task and wish that the necessary steps in this\r\ndirection be taken now.\r\nWhile there is agreement that the Security Council\r\nshould be enlarged, the discussion about how this is to be\r\naccomplished continues. We have reports and proposals.\r\nWhat is needed now is some creativity to reconcile the\r\ndifferent ideas and interests, with the aim of a\r\nstrengthened, representative and modern Security Council.\r\nA considerable number of States from all continents\r\nand regional groups, in their statements at the General\r\nAssembly, have referred to Germany as a country they\r\nwish to see as a permanent member of the Council. We\r\nare grateful for this proof of confidence. Having said this,\r\nwe are aware of the fact that reform of the Council is not\r\njust about the interests of individual countries. Its aim\r\nmust be to enable the United Nations to adjust to a\r\nchanging environment and to cope with the challenges of\r\nthe next millennium. If the United Nations community as\r\na whole calls on Germany to contribute to this immense\r\ntask we will be ready to assume the responsibility. We\r\nwill extend our commitment and build on our past\r\ncontribution to strengthen the United Nations.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nEnlargement, however, cannot be limited to the\r\naddition of one or two countries. We have never left any\r\ndoubt that it has to include additional seats for the regions\r\nof Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa.\r\nFurthermore, we need reform of the working methods of\r\nthe Council to increase its efficiency and transparency. In\r\nthis area, some progress has already been made. But here\r\ntoo more work is needed. Like other countries, we are of\r\nthe view that the two elements — enlargement and\r\nimprovement of working methods — are closely linked.\r\nReal reform will require solutions for both of them.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General points out, the\r\ndifficulties of peace-keeping should not divert attention\r\nfrom the other dimensions of the work of the Organization,\r\nwhich are equally — and in the long run, even more —\r\nessential. There can be no lasting peace without economic\r\nand social development. Here again the international\r\ncontext and the challenges to the United Nations have\r\ngreatly changed. Progress is visible in many countries,\r\nwhereas others remain at the margins of development.\r\nAdaptation to a changed and rapidly changing global\r\nenvironment has become a prime prerequisite for a more\r\neffective United Nations system in the field of\r\ndevelopment. Germany is fully committed to this process,\r\nand I should like to reiterate my country’s appreciation of\r\nthe efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to give\r\ndirection to the debate through his contribution, in the\r\nshape of “An Agenda for Development”, of May 1994, and\r\nthe concrete steps he is taking to make the Organization\r\nmore responsive and effective.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group charged with this\r\nvery important task has recently been able to make\r\nconsiderable progress under the excellent guidance of its\r\ntwo Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador Mongbé and Ambassador\r\nOsvald. We are confident that their assiduous efforts to\r\nprovide guidance and leadership will enable us to move\r\nforward with regard to all aspects of the Agenda. You have\r\nour full support, Mr. President, in the matter of achieving\r\nsubstantial results during the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council, in its agreed\r\nconclusions on the coordinated follow-up to the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences, has made a significant\r\ncontribution to this work, and this should be amply\r\nreflected in the final text. The Economic and Social\r\nCouncil’s role as an organ of the United Nations should be\r\nmore fully realized, particularly its job of coordinating\r\nUnited Nations activities in the economic, social and related\r\nfields and giving specific guidance in conformity with the\r\noverall consensus reached in the General Assembly. It\r\nshould play the central role in the coordination of\r\nfollow-up and implementation in respect of the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences, and the General Assembly\r\nshould support it fully in this task.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General states that\r\nreforming the United Nations into a simpler, more\r\nfocused and more integrated Organization has been a key\r\nobjective of his efforts since he took office in\r\nJanuary 1992. I would like to emphasize that my\r\nGovernment attaches the highest priority to this objective,\r\nparticularly in the social, economic and related fields,\r\nwhere a great number of organizations, agencies and\r\nprogrammes have been established, with various missions\r\nand mandates. Coordination and cooperation is not always\r\nthe pattern of behaviour amongst them; duplication and\r\noverlap are not unusual. The new realities of globalized\r\nmarkets and a rapidly changing world should make us\r\nreact not with an ever-growing number of institutions,\r\nmechanisms and bodies but with firm and clear priorities\r\nand goals and with institutions capable of adapting.\r\nWe are fully aware, as is the Secretary-General, that\r\nSecretariat reform must be part of a larger restructuring\r\neffort, including the intergovernmental machinery. We\r\nwill continue to support a more dynamic relationship\r\namong the main intergovernmental organs — the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. We would also like to see more\r\ninteraction between the Secretariat’s Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. An open and frank dialogue on priorities,\r\nemerging issues and the institutional response is an\r\nessential element of the ongoing reform process.\r\nThe Secretary-General has held extensive\r\nconsultations during the year with the Heads of the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the Executive Heads of\r\nthe other agencies on the follow-up to the United Nations\r\nconferences and on a renewed effort in support of African\r\ndevelopment. We believe that the institutional and the\r\nsubstantive issues are closely interrelated, and would be\r\nmost interested in a more detailed account of the\r\ncoordination among all United Nations institutions\r\nworking for development in Africa. We hope that the\r\ncomplementarity between the country strategy notes and\r\nthe policy framework papers under the aegis of the\r\nBretton Woods institutions can be enhanced, recognizing\r\nthat both institutions have their particular fields of\r\ncompetence. The Economic and Social Council, in our\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nview, would be an appropriate forum for further discussion\r\nof this matter.\r\nAnother area vital for the survival of the United\r\nNations is the financial situation. Here, two kinds of reform\r\nare necessary. On one hand, the financial system as such\r\nmust be changed; on the other hand, the United Nations\r\nsystem must be made more efficient. By “financial system\r\nas such” I mean the scale of assessments, the methodology\r\nof calculation — which stipulates, according to article 19\r\nof the Charter, that a Member may lose its right to vote and\r\nother penalties or incentives — as well as all other\r\nquestions that have been or are being discussed in the\r\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial\r\nSituation of the Organization.\r\nReform of the financial system must result in a more\r\nequitable scale of assessments — that is, the assessments\r\nowed by each Member State should be as close as possible\r\nto its actual capacity to pay. This new scale of assessments\r\nmust be accompanied by regulations that entice Member\r\nStates to pay their contributions on time and in full. The\r\nwork of the High-level Open-ended Working Group should\r\nbe resumed as soon as possible. An important element of\r\nany reform and its implementation will be the payment of\r\narrears.\r\nFinancial reforms have to be accompanied by\r\nincreases in efficiency within the United Nations. An\r\nefficient Organization will more easily entice Member\r\nStates to fulfil their financial obligations in full and on\r\ntime. In other words, efficiency offers an incentive to pay.\r\nFurthermore, only an increase in efficiency can ensure that\r\nthe United Nations will continue to have sufficient funds at\r\nits disposal for priority programmes.\r\nIn times of decreasing national budgets, the United\r\nNations cannot assume that its budget can be increased.\r\nThis means that only through efficiency gains in the\r\nadministrative sector can sufficient funds be made available\r\nfor programmes and missions. The achievement of this goal\r\nis primarily a task for the Secretary-General. My delegation\r\nis pleased that he has already taken the first steps. We\r\nsupport his efforts to use the budgetary process to increase\r\nthe efficiency of the Organization, and we welcome the fact\r\nthat the draft budget for 1996-97 shows the first signs of\r\nsuccess. We also note that the Secretary-General has begun\r\nto initiate improvements in many areas, such as personnel\r\nmanagement and procurement, and has established an\r\nefficiency board with a view to making the Organization\r\nmore efficient and, thus, more attractive for Member States.\r\nWe believe that an efficient Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services is another prerequisite to safeguard the\r\nOrganization’s attractiveness now and, equally important,\r\nfor the future.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): The report (A/50/1) of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization is an\r\nimportant and useful document. It provides a\r\ncomprehensive review of the activities of the United\r\nNations in the past year and valuable insight into the\r\nefforts of the Organization to adjust to the needs of our\r\ntime.\r\nIn general, the report is a testimony to the diversity\r\nand vigour of United Nations activities. It reflects the\r\ncurrent trends in the Organization’s development and the\r\nserious obstacles that continue to impede the desired\r\nprogress. It shows that the complexity of the post-cold-\r\nwar era represents a serious problem for the United\r\nNations, perhaps even more serious than the global\r\npolitical and military tension which characterized the\r\nbipolar world of the preceding period.\r\nThe Organization continues to be engaged in a\r\nvariety of demanding activities. Every section of the\r\nreport, including, typically, the section on the United\r\nNations Secretariat, demonstrates that variety. For\r\nexample, the work of the Office of Legal Affairs, outlined\r\nin paragraphs 102 to 116, now ranges from the\r\nimplementation of various decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil, including those relating to the ad hoc Tribunals\r\ndealing with violations of international humanitarian law,\r\nto a variety of aspects of the law of the sea and the\r\nexploration of new areas of codification and\r\nimplementation of international law.\r\nThe work of the bodies within the framework of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council has expanded substantially\r\nafter the recent series of world conferences, and the\r\nquestion of the coherent implementation of commitments\r\nadopted at those conferences represents the main task of\r\nthese bodies.\r\nThe Organization continues to experience the\r\nsobering effects that were bound to follow the period of\r\nhigh expectations and ambitious decisions in the domain\r\nof the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe financial situation of the Organization continues\r\nto be grim. However, the efforts of the High-level Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the\r\nOrganization are commendable and deserve the fullest\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nsupport. We hope that they will contribute to improvements\r\nin the payment of assessed contributions and, thus, to the\r\nnormal functioning of the budget for the coming biennium.\r\nAs a Member State that pays its assessed contributions to\r\nthe regular budget in full and on time, Slovenia hopes that\r\nthe number of Members in this category will substantially\r\nincrease in the coming year.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General contains a number\r\nof valuable reflections on questions relating to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In this\r\ncontext, it is rightly emphasized that the Organization is\r\nfacing a variety of new situations, including new types of\r\nmilitary conflict which might be considered to represent\r\nthreats to the peace.\r\nThe questions concerning the nature of contemporary\r\narmed conflicts have been discussed in the General\r\nAssembly’s Working Group on An Agenda for Peace, as\r\nwell as in the Security Council. These discussions deal with\r\nan important aspect of the work of the United Nations and\r\nshould continue, with a view to clarifying the pertinent\r\nissues. Let me offer some thoughts in this regard.\r\nIn general, one may agree that the new international\r\npolitical environment is characterized by military conflicts\r\nwhich are in some respects different from those of the past,\r\nas the Secretary-General says in the report. The political\r\nactors involved in such situations have increased in number\r\nand become more diverse. The current wars by proxy are\r\nsometimes fought on behalf of smaller States and for a\r\nvariety of political agendas. Often, the inter-State aspects\r\nare less apparent or are deliberately obscured. However,\r\nmerely qualifying such conflicts as internal will not do.\r\nAdditional efforts are needed in the analysis of their causes\r\nand actors.\r\nIt is sometimes suggested that ethnic and religious\r\nfactors are decisive in certain conflicts, which are therefore\r\ndescribed as ethnic or religious. We would like to caution\r\nagainst hasty categorizations by the use of these terms. A\r\nlook into the past would help to reveal the presence of\r\nethnic and religious elements in many wars of the past and\r\nother, non-ethnic and non-religious elements in the conflicts\r\nof the present. It is probably possible to speak of the\r\ncoefficient of the ethnic element in most of the military\r\nconflicts in human history. What is really necessary,\r\nhowever — perhaps today more than ever before — is\r\ncareful identification of the real actors in each situation and\r\nthe identification of their actual agendas. Only if this is\r\ndone can one hope that the response to a given situation by\r\nthe United Nations or by other international mechanisms\r\nwill correspond to the actual needs.\r\nI spoke of the changing nature of the issues dealt\r\nwith by the Security Council also because this is one of\r\nthe reasons for the needed reform of the Council, which\r\nis one of the principal organs of the United Nations.\r\nThere are, of course, other reasons, including the need to\r\nenhance the representative character of the Council and\r\nthe level of support from United Nations Members for the\r\nwork and decisions of the Council.\r\nFor all these reasons, an appropriate expansion of\r\nthe number of both the permanent and the non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council is called for. We shall\r\naddress the pertinent issues in some detail under the\r\nappropriate agenda item later on. Suffice it to say at this\r\nstage that the progress made in efforts for the reform of\r\nthe Security Council is relatively slow and needs to be\r\nenergized.\r\nThe difficulties in the process of Security Council\r\nreform are not surprising, and are perhaps a good\r\nexample of the difficulties encountered in the efforts for\r\nthe reform of various other areas of the Organization’s\r\nactivity.\r\nAnother area where successful reform is overdue is\r\nthe work of the Economic and Social Council and various\r\nbodies and organizations coordinated by that principal\r\nUnited Nations organ. The report of the Secretary-General\r\nprovides an impressive account of work currently under\r\nway and of the efforts to improve coordination. However,\r\nmore needs to be done.\r\nIn the current thinking about the necessary reform\r\nmeasures, it is vital to keep in mind the reality of the\r\ndynamic change in the global economic and social\r\nspheres, the ever growing importance of market forces\r\nand the global nature of the changes. Changes in\r\ninstitutional structures, including United Nations\r\nstructures, have to be conceived with full awareness of\r\nthis reality.\r\nGiven the diminishing role of the State in most\r\neconomic matters, it seems inappropriate to propose the\r\nestablishment of an additional principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations — an economic security council — as has\r\nbeen envisaged in some proposals for reform formulated\r\noutside the United Nations.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nOn the other hand, it also seems inappropriate to\r\nde-link the economic and social component by, for\r\nexample, creating two separate councils: an economic\r\ncouncil and a social council. The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment proved the importance of considering the\r\neconomic and social aspects of development as parts of a\r\ncomprehensive approach which ought to proceed from the\r\nnotion of the centrality of the human person in\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe commitments and programmes adopted at the\r\nrecent world conferences have given rise to the question of\r\nthe implementation of the agreed documents. These tasks\r\nare specific, and the work of the functional commissions of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council in this context is critical.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization mentions, for example, that more than 40\r\nMinisters attended the third session of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development. This demonstrates the importance\r\nof that particular Commission.\r\nIt would be desirable for all the commissions given\r\nnew substantive tasks as a result of recent world\r\nconferences to become places of meaningful policy-making\r\nat an appropriately practical level. The results so far have\r\nbeen mixed, and it is necessary to look into the reasons for\r\nthe uneven levels of activity of different commissions. If\r\nadditional resources are needed for the proper preparation\r\nof their work, then such resources must be made available.\r\nThis would be a useful investment, for nothing is more\r\nharmful for any ongoing project than disappointment\r\nresulting from insufficient implementation.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to mention another aspect\r\nof United Nations activities in which reform efforts are\r\nnecessary: efforts for the implementation of human rights.\r\nThe United Nations has done much in the field of\r\nstandard-setting and in the development of a series of\r\ninstitutional mechanisms. It is necessary that these\r\nmechanisms work in a coordinated manner with a view to\r\nachieving maximum effect. The need to further improve the\r\nobjectivity of human rights work — and I stress\r\n“objectivity” — and the quality of reports prepared in this\r\ncontext is constantly growing. To a large extent, success in\r\nthis domain will depend on improvements in the relevant\r\nparts of the Secretariat and on a reasonable amount of\r\nadditional resources.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization reminds us in a variety of ways of the\r\nurgency of United Nations reforms. Let us make this debate\r\na contribution in the efforts for genuine progress and\r\nreform.\r\nMr. Hamdoon (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me pleasure, at the outset, to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to preside over the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this critical juncture in its history.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to have the opportunity to\r\nrespond to the Secretary-General’s comprehensive report\r\non the work of the Organization (A/50/1). We consider\r\nthat discussion of this report in the General Assembly\r\naffords Member States an excellent opportunity to\r\nexchange views on the functioning of the Organization, to\r\nevaluate results, and to lay down guidelines for future\r\naction.\r\nThe Secretary-General describes the report as:\r\n“an effort at transparency, revealing both the\r\nstrengths and weaknesses of the Organization to the\r\nwidest possible audience”. (A/50/1, para. 994)\r\nThe report contains proposals and ideas which call\r\nfor deeper reflection on the functioning and effectiveness\r\nof our Organization. Such proposals and ideas supplement\r\nthose put forward by Member States during discussions in\r\nvarious General Assembly working groups, especially the\r\nWorking Group on reform of the Security Council, and\r\nthe Working Group on “An Agenda for Peace”. The\r\nprincipal idea that emerged from those discussions and\r\nwhich merits deep consideration concerns the need to\r\nenhance democracy and to strengthen the spirit of\r\ncollective work in the decision-making process and the\r\nworking methods of the United Nations and its principal\r\norgans.\r\nThe experience of the past 50 years, and particularly\r\nof the past five years, has shown that the weakness of the\r\ndemocratic nature and the insufficiency of the spirit of\r\ncollective work in the decision-making process in the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations have made those\r\norgans vulnerable to the influence of major Powers. This,\r\nin turn, has impacted negatively on the credibility and\r\nindependence of the United Nations.\r\nDuring the cold-war era, the conflicts of interest\r\nbetween the two super-Powers paralysed many of the\r\nactivities of United Nations organs. After the cold war,\r\nthe supremacy of one super-Power enabled that Power to\r\nimpose its views, interests and policies on the United\r\nNations to the detriment of the interests of the majority of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nMember States and the very principles of the Charter. We\r\ndo not need to go far in search of proof. Mr. James Baker,\r\nthe former Secretary of State of the United States, declared\r\nthat fact on 21 June 1995:\r\n“Let me make one point very, very clear to you.\r\nOur use of the United Nations was not driven by any\r\nstarry-eyed commitment to multilateralism. It was\r\ndriven by a sober recognition of the usefulness of the\r\nUnited Nations as a vehicle for American leadership.\r\nI think that we have to always remember that the\r\nUnited Nations is a means; it is not an end for\r\nAmerican foreign policy”.\r\nIt is worth noting that Mr. Baker was Secretary of State\r\nduring the period from 1989 to 1992, the very period in\r\nwhich the resolutions imposing comprehensive sanctions\r\nagainst Iraq were adopted.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report contains a section\r\nentitled “Iraq-Kuwait”. Although we do not agree with\r\nmany formulations contained in it, I shall comment on three\r\npoints only:\r\nFirst, I reiterate what the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Republic of Iraq stated from this rostrum just a few\r\ndays ago:\r\n“Despite all the propaganda, Iraq does not have\r\nany proscribed weapons, equipment, devices or\r\nmaterial, and this is the essence of resolution\r\n687 (1991). We affirm our determination to continue\r\nour cooperation with the Special Commission and the\r\nIAEA to close the weapons file in accordance with the\r\nrelevant resolutions and have the embargo against Iraq\r\nlifted”. (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 21st meeting, p. 9)\r\nThe IAEA’s report of 6 October 1995 to the Security\r\nCouncil confirms that Iraq is honouring this commitment.\r\nThe report states that:\r\n“The level of practical cooperation by Iraqi\r\ncounterparts in facilitating and expediting IAEA’s\r\nfield work continues to be high”. (S/1995/844,\r\nappendix, para. 18)\r\nThe same report indicates also that:\r\n“The reporting requirements stipulated in\r\nparagraph 22 and Annex 2 of the Plan are being\r\nfulfilled regularly at six-month intervals by the Iraqi\r\nauthorities”. (Ibid., para. 19)\r\nSecondly, the Secretary-General’s report referred to\r\nwhat it called “the recent Turkish military operations on\r\nthe Turkish/Iraq border” (A/50/1, para. 712). This\r\ndescription is not accurate. The Turkish operations were\r\na military invasion of Iraq’s territory. The Security\r\nCouncil took no action to deter this aggression, in\r\npursuance of its policy of double standards towards Iraq.\r\nThirdly, the Secretary-General describes the\r\nhumanitarian situation of the Iraqi population as follows:\r\n“Health conditions have continued to\r\ndeteriorate throughout the country because of\r\nshortages of essential drugs and medical supplies.\r\nThe situation is further aggravated by the inadequate\r\nsupply of potable water and poor sanitation facilities,\r\nas essential equipment and spare parts are lacking to\r\nrehabilitate the water, sewage and electricity supply\r\nsystems”. (Ibid., para. 711)\r\nElsewhere the Secretary-General states that:\r\n“By all accounts, children are increasingly dying of\r\nailments linked to malnutrition and lack of adequate\r\nmedical care”. (Ibid., para. 716)\r\nThe report also warns that hunger threatens the lives of\r\nover 1 million Iraqi civilians.\r\nWe hope that these paragraphs will bring home to\r\nthe international community the fact that the human\r\ntragedy of the Iraqi population is caused by Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, and that there is no reason\r\nwhatsoever for the continuation of this tragedy.\r\nThe United Nations was created to prevent wars and\r\nthe crimes of genocide. Unfortunately, however, the\r\nUnited Nations has not been able to achieve this objective\r\nas it should have. Genocide in Rwanda took place\r\nbecause the United Nations acted too late. Genocide is\r\ntaking place in Iraq and has been taking place for over\r\nfive years now because the United Nations moved in the\r\nwrong direction. We do hope that these mistakes will be\r\ncorrected, and that future United Nations action will be\r\ntimely and in the right direction.\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium) (interpretation from French):\r\nToday the General Assembly has before it the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\ncovering this past year. First of all, I would like to pay\r\ntribute to the efforts made by the Secretary-General and\r\nhis staff in preparing this undeniably useful document. As\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nin earlier years, the report gives us a detailed account of\r\nUnited Nations activities over the past 12 months. It is a\r\nvaluable reference document which enables us to assess\r\nwhat the United Nations has done, but the report is more\r\nthan a simple compilation of United Nations activities. It\r\nuses past experience to suggest the main thrust of future\r\npriorities, which the Secretary-General is no doubt best able\r\nto describe.\r\nAs I see it, the most important message in the report\r\nis the statement that\r\n“mutually beneficial international institutions of\r\ncooperation — with the United Nations foremost\r\namong them — are a vital global necessity”.\r\n(A/50/1, para. 999)\r\nToday the international community must face a\r\ngrowing number of global challenges, which no State,\r\nhowever powerful or influential, can handle alone.\r\nSolidarity emerges increasingly clearly as the best way of\r\ngrasping at this increasing globalization, and the United\r\nNations remains the best instrument for this vital solidarity.\r\nBut the United Nations will be unable to do anything unless\r\nwe all resolutely commit ourselves to give effect to this\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe harmonious development of peaceful relations\r\nbetween States is the heart of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. This objective is indeed the main focus of United\r\nNations activities. While stability in international relations\r\nis still viewed in military terms, it is no longer viewed in\r\nmilitary terms only. The Secretary-General notes in his\r\nreport quite correctly that economic and social\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian activities and, clearly, the\r\ndefence and promotion of human rights are the foundations\r\nof peace. The Belgian Foreign Minister recently clearly\r\nendorsed this approach in his statement in the general\r\ndebate, and today I can only confirm that Belgium attaches\r\ngreat importance to economic and social development; we\r\nmust adapt the organs of the United Nations to address this.\r\nAnd Belgium attaches importance to human rights, as\r\neverybody is aware. We see these goals as complementary\r\npillars in building peaceful international relations. The\r\nseries of major conferences, which has just ended, shows\r\nthe self-evident importance that we all attach today to these\r\nobjectives. Now that these major conferences are over, we\r\nmust turn to implementing their results: we must daily build\r\non the foundations laid by those conferences.\r\nThe fact that the United Nations has to focus on\r\nhuman rights and humanitarian issues, and economic and\r\nsocial development, does not mean that the United\r\nNations must simply give up in the area of peace-keeping,\r\nin the strict sense of the expression. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral said,\r\n“nor must adversity be allowed to weaken our\r\nresolve to carry forward efforts to save human\r\nlives and prevent larger conflicts, for which the\r\nUnited Nations remains an irreplaceable\r\ninstrument”. (A/50/1, para. 7)\r\nThe United Nations is, indeed, an irreplaceable\r\ninstrument for expressing the universal political will to\r\ndefend collective security on behalf of all and for all. We\r\nthink that it would be very dangerous to place the United\r\nNations on the sidelines here. What might be gained in\r\nterms of effectiveness would quickly be lost in terms of\r\ntrust and credibility. This would be a dangerous trend\r\nwhich could lead to deplorable unilateral reflexes. So it\r\nseems essential to preserve solidarity in action to preserve\r\nthe peace. Of course, it is often very difficult to manifest\r\nthis solidarity. Action in this regard is based on\r\npainstaking compromise, and its limits are vague.\r\nSetbacks occur frequently. But solidarity still has the\r\nmerit of uniting the international community in the\r\ndefence of a common cause. The more principles and\r\ninternational law are affirmed, the easier it will be to\r\nimplement this work of solidarity.\r\nThe Secretary-General devotes considerable attention\r\nin his report on the financial crisis of the United Nations.\r\nIt is clear that the United Nations can do nothing unless\r\nwe strengthen its financial basis, to which all Member\r\nStates must contribute. We understand the current\r\nquestioning of the scale of assessments. The criteria\r\nunderlying it are perhaps no longer relevant today, and\r\nyet, they were established by consensus, and so they can\r\nalso only be revised by consensus. The United Nations\r\nmust not be the hostage of continuing differences in\r\nviews which cannot be reconciled if excessively rigid\r\npositions of principle are defended. We trust that the\r\nWorking Group will be able to successfully conclude its\r\nwork at this session.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General deals with many\r\nother issues on which I have not dwelt. I simply wished\r\nto highlight those issues which I see as essential, which,\r\nas I see it, in no way detracts from the importance of\r\nother developments in the report: the report is an\r\nextremely useful reference document on the activities of\r\nthe Organization. In conclusion, I would just like once\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nagain to thank the Secretary-General and his staff for the\r\nreport.\r\nMr. Velliste (Estonia): On behalf of my delegation, I\r\nwould like to express my appreciation for and satisfaction\r\nwith the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe work of the Organization. The Estonian delegation has\r\ncarefully studied the report. In a few days, Member States\r\nwill gather at the special commemorative meeting on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nFifty years is an important milestone and a good time to\r\nlook back at the past year and to examine how the goals\r\nfixed in the Charter have been or are being achieved.\r\nThe Estonian delegation notes with appreciation the\r\nhuge work that the Organization as a whole is carrying out.\r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly points out in his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, setbacks must not be allowed\r\nto overshadow the success achieved by the United Nations.\r\nUnfortunately, the end of the cold war did not end\r\nconflicts in various parts of the world. International peace\r\nand friendly relations among nations still remain a goal to\r\nbe achieved through common efforts. In this respect, the\r\nEstonian delegation would like to reiterate that no double\r\nstandards should be allowed on any of the questions that\r\nare in the competence of the United Nations, including\r\nsecurity and disarmament issues.\r\nThe Estonian delegation takes note of the efforts\r\nundertaken to establish solid foundations for international\r\npeace, in the areas of development, humanitarian action and\r\nhuman rights. A special working group on an “Agenda for\r\nDevelopment” is, on the basis of the principal\r\nrecommendations submitted to the General Assembly in\r\nNovember 1994, on its way towards developing its text. In\r\nthis regard it is of great importance that special attention be\r\npaid to the means of implementing the Agenda, which deals\r\nwith a wide range of development matters, including peace,\r\nsocial justice and democracy.\r\nIn terms of operational activities for development, the\r\nEstonian delegation would like to highlight the work of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through\r\nits country office in Estonia which was established in 1993\r\nand which has been enhancing the coordination of\r\ninternational assistance efforts in Estonia and actively\r\ncontributing to the implementation of the country\r\nprogramme.\r\nThe Estonian delegation notes with satisfaction the\r\nglobal approach by the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP) to the problem of narcotic\r\ndrugs. Estonia, which is having increasing problems\r\nconnected with narcotic drugs, especially related to drug\r\ntrafficking through my country, is making efforts in the\r\nframework of the UNDCP to participate effectively in\r\ninternational cooperation against illicit production, sale,\r\ndemand, traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and\r\npsychotropic substances.\r\nOne of the tasks of the United Nations has been, and\r\nwill continue to be, lending humanitarian assistance in\r\nemergency situations such as crises, natural disasters, and\r\nso forth. The Estonian delegation is of the opinion that\r\nthe major relief operations during the past year in Kenya,\r\nSudan, Ukraine and Chechnya should bring Member\r\nStates and the whole Organization to a careful analysis of\r\nthe underlying causes of the crises. The whole\r\nOrganization, our Organization, should make all efforts to\r\navoid similar situations in the future if their causes are\r\nnot beyond human control. Respect for human life is one\r\nof the basic principles that we all should be guided by.\r\nNothing can justify the sufferings of thousands of\r\ninnocent victims.\r\nIn the field of human rights, the Estonian delegation\r\nnotes with appreciation the activities of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, especially\r\nthe High Commissioner’s efforts to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation. The Estonian delegation would\r\nonce more like to stress the need to make the work of the\r\nHigh Commissioner available to a wider audience.\r\nUniversal respect for human rights should become a norm\r\nin the twenty-first century.\r\nThe complexity of regional conflicts, and especially\r\nof those in the territory of former Yugoslavia, is leading\r\nthe United Nations to the revision of peace-keeping\r\nconcepts and to a change in the United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping role in the Balkans. The Organization should\r\ncontinue its efforts to enhance the effectiveness of peace-\r\nkeeping. Stand-by arrangements should be further\r\ndeveloped in order to allow for rapid deployment of\r\nresources and greater efficiency of the operations.\r\nThe Organization’s increasing financial constraints\r\nshould induce the United Nations, including its\r\nSecretariat, to consider how to make its work more\r\neffective and result-oriented. All overlaps should be\r\navoided and the effectiveness of big international\r\nconferences should be carefully considered.\r\nLet me conclude by stating the conviction that,\r\ntogether with all other Member States, we will be able to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\ndevelop the United Nations into a stronger and more\r\nefficient system working for the realization of\r\ninternationally-agreed goals and objectives.\r\nMr. Mahmood (Pakistan): I would like to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization. On the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, this report brings out not\r\nonly the difficulties faced by the United Nations, but also\r\nremedial measures and recommendations for responding to\r\nvarious challenges.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the legacy\r\nof 1945 must be cherished and carried forward. The United\r\nNations remains an irreplaceable instrument. In the\r\naftermath of the cold war, our hopes for a better and\r\nprosperous future for humanity have not been fulfilled. The\r\nSecretary-General has reported that new wars and conflicts\r\nhave erupted between States and that the total volume of\r\ndevelopment assistance to the developing countries has\r\ndeclined. The outbreak of conflicts has created new\r\ndemands on the United Nations in the fields of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building.\r\nYet the resources put at the disposal of the United Nations\r\nto undertake these responsibilities are woefully inadequate.\r\nThe United Nations is facing a serious financial crisis.\r\nIn the recent past, we have seen a pattern of ever-increasing\r\ndemands and shrinking resources. The Secretary-General\r\nhas reported a shortfall in assessed contributions totalling\r\n$3.9 billion. As a result, funds for development are drying\r\nup, and unpaid reimbursement to troop-contributors has\r\nrisen to reach $1 billion. These problems, and the lack of\r\nsafety of United Nations personnel in the field, constitute\r\nthree immediate concerns for the Organization. In this\r\nregard, we must heed the Secretary-General’s wise counsel\r\nto try to solve the financial crisis facing the United Nations\r\nand to strengthen its capacity for preventive diplomacy and\r\nearly warning mechanisms, particularly in situations where\r\ninternational peace and security are likely to be endangered.\r\nPakistan is strongly committed to the United Nations\r\nrole in peace-keeping. We believe that United Nations\r\npeace-keeping exemplifies the sustained political\r\ncommitment of Member States to the concept of collective\r\nsecurity and the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Despite the enormous difficulties and heavy costs\r\ninvolved, Pakistan has been in the forefront of United\r\nNations peace-keeping efforts. Pakistan is one of the few\r\ncountries that have strongly advocated the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping role and offered their services in areas of\r\nhigh risk. The brave soldiers of Pakistan have sacrificed\r\ntheir lives defending peace in Somalia and other parts of\r\nthe world. At present, Pakistan is the third largest troop-\r\ncontributing country to United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. We are, therefore, fully aware of the grave\r\ndifficulties referred to by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport regarding peace-keeping missions and resources.\r\nDespite these difficulties, peace-keeping is an important\r\npillar of United Nations diplomacy and must be supported\r\nat all costs in order to enhance the credibility of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe fully support the recommendations made by the\r\nSecretary-General in the Supplement to “An Agenda for\r\nPeace”. Priority should be given to conflict prevention\r\nand to agreement by States to make full use of\r\ninstruments of preventive action, including the good\r\noffices of the Secretary-General, the dispatch of special\r\nenvoys and the deployment of United Nations missions\r\nfor preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. We also\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s pledge to redouble his\r\nefforts to prevent conflicts through early warning, quiet\r\ndiplomacy and preventive deployment. This could be a\r\nsubstitute for costly politico-military efforts to resolve\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his annual report of 1994,\r\nnoted that relations between India and Pakistan continued\r\nto be marred over the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, one\r\nof the oldest unresolved conflicts still on the United\r\nNations agenda. It is unfortunate that, in the past 50\r\nyears, the United Nations has not been able to resolve the\r\nKashmir dispute through the implementation of the\r\nSecurity Council’s resolutions. Last year, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral offered to exert every possible effort to facilitate\r\nthe search for a lasting solution to the Kashmir issue.\r\nPakistan welcomed this offer.\r\nSince last year, the situation in Jammu and Kashmir\r\nhas further deteriorated. In this year’s report, the\r\nSecretary-General has confirmed increasing violence in\r\nJammu and Kashmir and a further aggravation of relations\r\nbetween India and Pakistan. During the past year,\r\nthousands of people have been killed by the Indian\r\nsecurity forces. Brutal repression and violations of human\r\nrights continue unabated. Massacres, killings, torture,\r\narbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions and\r\n“disappearances” in Jammu and Kashmir have been\r\nwidely reported by human rights organizations and\r\ninternational media. The Indian troops have used rape as\r\na weapon of war against Kashmiri women to intimidate\r\nthe Kashmiri population. The targets of the Indian terror\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nin Kashmir are peaceful civilians. India continues to flout\r\nall norms of international humanitarian law. In fact, over\r\nthe past five years, 600,000 Indian troops have launched a\r\nwar of aggression against the disputed territory of Jammu\r\nand Kashmir, a war recognized as such by the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn this context, we note with regret that the United\r\nNations Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiary\r\nbodies have not played an effective role in persuading India\r\nto desist from a systematic genocide of the Kashmiri\r\npeople. Over 50,000 Kashmiri men, women and children\r\nhave been killed in the past five years through an organized\r\ncampaign of State terrorism. It is surprising that none of\r\nthese brutalities are even mentioned in the United Nations\r\nreports. We urge the Commission on Human Rights\r\nurgently to dispatch a mission to Jammu and Kashmir to\r\ndocument massive human rights violations committed by\r\nthe Indian occupation forces.\r\nPakistan, for its part, has made many offers for a\r\npeaceful solution of the dispute of Jammu and Kashmir. We\r\nhave accepted the Secretary-General’s offer of good offices.\r\nIndia, from time to time, accuses Pakistan of interference\r\nin Jammu and Kashmir. Since May 1990, Pakistan has\r\nrepeatedly proposed the establishment of a neutral\r\nmechanism in Jammu and Kashmir to monitor and survey\r\nthe situation along the line of control. Last year, the\r\nForeign Minister of Pakistan wrote to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council proposing an increase in the number of\r\nobservers in the United Nations Military Observer Group in\r\nIndia and Pakistan, which is already deployed in Jammu\r\nand Kashmir. India has, unfortunately, rejected all these\r\nproposals.\r\nThe tensions generated by the Jammu and Kashmir\r\ndispute threaten both regional and international peace and\r\nsecurity. Pakistan considers it absolutely vital that the\r\nUnited Nations should intercede in order to promote a just\r\nand peaceful solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in\r\naccordance with the resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThe Security Council has mandated that the final\r\ndisposition of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute should be\r\ndetermined in accordance with the will of the people of\r\nJammu and Kashmir through a free and impartial plebescite\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. We must pursue\r\nthis agreed course of action. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that there is\r\n“an urgency of seeking a political solution through a\r\nmeaningful dialogue”. (A/50/1, para. 694)\r\nIndia has rejected all overtures made by Pakistan.\r\nThe moment any round of negotiations starts, India takes\r\na historically incorrect and legally invalid stance that\r\nJammu and Kashmir is a part of India. There is a virtual\r\nstalemate in Indo-Pakistan dialogue. Therefore, there is a\r\nneed for intercession by the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The Secretary-General has maintained contacts\r\nwith both India and Pakistan. However, in view of the\r\nfast-deteriorating situation in Jammu and Kashmir, there\r\nis an urgent need to intensify the Secretary-General’s\r\nmediatory efforts. If India does not accept the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s offer of good offices, we would propose that\r\nthe Secretary-General consider appointing a special\r\nrepresentative who could collect correct information about\r\nthe situation in Jammu and Kashmir and facilitate the\r\nprocess for a meaningful dialogue for the solution of the\r\nKashmir issue.\r\nThe search for peace is the noblest goal of the\r\ninternational community and our Organization. The old\r\nconflicts which continue to defy the efforts of the\r\ninternational community at settlement must be faced in a\r\ncourageous and determined manner. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has sounded an optimistic note in his report:\r\n“It is therefore imperative to remain focused on the\r\nreality of movement towards long-term achievement\r\nand not to permit dismay over immediate difficulties\r\nto weaken the positive momentum that has been\r\nachieved.” (A/50/1, para. 1000)\r\nBut this is no time for complacency. The United\r\nNations success is only qualified. Today, while we are\r\nre-assessing the role of the United Nations, we must\r\nstrengthen its capacity to play an assertive and forceful\r\nrole in the pacific settlement of disputes. This is\r\nabsolutely necessary if we are to remove growing\r\nmisgivings about the credibility and viability of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): This year’s report of the\r\nSecretary-General again contains an impressive overview\r\nof the manifold activities of the Organization. I should\r\nlike to use the discussion of this “state of the\r\nOrganization” report to advance a number of ideas of a\r\ngeneral nature.\r\nWe all know, or should know, that the Organization\r\nis facing a crisis. The Secretary-General’s report makes it\r\nvery clear that this is not due to a lack of activities\r\nincumbent upon the Organization nor to a lack of\r\nresponse from the side of the Secretariat. I believe,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nhowever, that we all suffer from the fact that outside this\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall many people, including opinion\r\nleaders and politicians, fail to see the political relevance of\r\nwhat we are doing, of what we are debating. They fail to\r\nsee the political relevance of the scores of resolutions that\r\nare being routinely adopted year after year.\r\nThis lack of perceived political relevance is the real\r\nand deeper reason for the serious financial crisis of this\r\nOrganization. We have to attack this crisis at its roots. This\r\nsole, truly global Organization, with all its proud\r\nachievements and lamentable failures, is the mirror image\r\nof the collective political will of its membership or the lack\r\nthereof. This is true, but we, the representatives to this\r\nOrganization in New York, Geneva, Vienna and other duty\r\nstations, are the ones who are responsible for the creation\r\nof this political will. Let us not squander the unique\r\npotential of the United Nations in seemingly endless\r\ndebates and frustrating searches for compromise resolutions.\r\nWhat can we do? I suggest the following.\r\nLet us support the role of the Secretary-General,\r\nespecially in those activities that do have a real impact on\r\nthe state of affairs, such as preventive diplomacy,\r\npost-conflict management, peace building and disaster\r\nrelief, including effective response to complex emergencies,\r\noperational activities for development, assistance in the area\r\nof capacity-building for democracy and strengthening of the\r\nrule of law.\r\nLet us use the General Assembly and all the other\r\ndeliberative bodies to take positive action in order to give\r\nthe operational arm of our Organization clear mandates and\r\nthe necessary resources. It is up to us, the Member States,\r\nto focus our work more sharply, especially in the General\r\nAssembly and its committees, to make the best possible use\r\nof the Organization. The proposals contained in paragraph\r\n184 of the Secretary-General’s report are most relevant in\r\nthis regard.\r\nLet us combine our efforts to help improve — with\r\nthe help of the professional activities of the Department of\r\nPublic Information — the public image of the United\r\nNations here in the United States and back home in our\r\nvarious countries.\r\nLet us use the fiftieth anniversary to start serious\r\nthinking about reform. This discussion must not be based\r\nsolely on budgetary considerations, important as they are;\r\nit should focus on the need to clearly define priorities, the\r\nnecessity to streamline the Organization accordingly, to\r\ndevelop synergies through a clustering of activities and to\r\nadapt its structure where mainstreaming is necessary. In\r\nso doing we must certainly eliminate duplication, waste\r\nand mismanagement, where they occur, but we must also\r\nensure continued universal participation in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations system. We must ensure variety in order\r\nto keep the system competitive.\r\nReform must not stop at the level of the Secretariat.\r\nWe, representatives of the Member States, must also\r\ncritically appraise our own performance and that of our\r\ndelegations. Does the sharply increasing number of\r\nmeetings and requests for reports to be submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General really correspond to an increased and\r\nimproved output of our deliberations? What is the value\r\nof the impressive collection of routine resolutions adopted\r\non a yearly basis by countless intergovernmental bodies?\r\nHave we ourselves taken the necessary steps to avoid\r\nduplication and improve coordination among the various\r\nintergovernmental bodies? I do not think we have, but I\r\ncertainly believe we should.\r\nLet us proceed with organizational and structural\r\nreforms by all means, but let us not forget substance.\r\nWe must redirect our focus towards the individual’s\r\nwell-being, towards human-centred social and economic\r\ndevelopment, towards better protection against human\r\nrights violations. This Organization must be seen to make\r\na real difference for each and every woman and man,\r\neach and every child; it must reach out to the individual.\r\nWe must reinforce those activities of the United\r\nNations system that address critical issues affecting\r\ntoday’s societies: drug abuse, organized crime, HIV-\r\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the\r\nenvironment, population and development are keywords\r\nthat will come to everybody’s mind.\r\nConfidence in the United Nations system will\r\ndepend in particular on the way the system is able to face\r\nthe future challenges in the field of development. Its\r\nunique role in raising public consciousness, in providing\r\ninformation, in defining the international development\r\nagenda and in building international consensus must be\r\nrecognized and strengthened.\r\nLet me very briefly return to the difficult financial\r\nsituation of the Organization, to which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly devotes so much attention in his report.\r\nThere should be no illusion: whereas this certainly is not\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nthe first financial crisis the Organization has had to face, it\r\nis the most serious one; for the first time the very existence\r\nof the United Nations is called into doubt, through the\r\ncumulative effects of its financial and political predicament.\r\nThe Special Commemorative Meeting which we will hold\r\nnext week will have failed if it does not give us a strong\r\nand clear mandate to combine our best efforts to come up\r\nwith workable solutions within a reasonable period of time.\r\nThe pillars of such a solution should be clear for\r\neverybody to see: political commitments to honour the\r\nrelevant Charter obligations — obligations assumed by\r\nMember States under international law — that is, to pay\r\nassessed contributions in full and on time; a schedule for\r\nthe payment of outstanding arrears; a reformed system for\r\nthe scales of assessment which must reflect today’s\r\neconomic realities, paying due attention to the principle of\r\ncapacity to pay; and balanced arrangements for incentives\r\nand disincentives.\r\nThe High-level Working Group established by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session should be used\r\nas the most suitable forum for sincere and action-oriented\r\nnegotiations.\r\nMost importantly, and this will be my last point: we\r\nshould strongly support the Secretary-General in his efforts\r\nto improve organizational performance by the Secretariat so\r\nthat mandates set by the General Assembly are delivered in\r\nan effective and timely manner. In this context, the new\r\nperformance appraisal system should take us an important\r\nstep closer to the goal of an efficient output-oriented\r\nSecretariat. It also provides a means for appropriate\r\nrecognition of individual staff performance.\r\nThis Organization relies on the high quality and\r\ndedication of its staff; let us strengthen the ideal of an\r\ninternational civil service, let us ensure supreme standards\r\nand let us protect the United Nations staff against\r\nundeserved criticism; and let us find a way to pay special\r\ntribute to our staff on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil): The opportunity offered the\r\nGeneral Assembly to comment upon the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization is of\r\nparticular relevance as we celebrate its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nAs the Secretary-General himself points out in the\r\nconclusions of his thought-provoking report, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary is helping to create\r\n“a renewed sense of commitment to fulfil the\r\noriginal promise set down in the Charter 50 years\r\nago.” (A/50/1, para. 990).\r\nThis renewed commitment can only profit from\r\nconstructive criticism. We have already entered a phase\r\nof reappraisal that should lead to improvements.\r\nMy first comment would relate to the need for\r\npreservation and revitalization of the role of the General\r\nAssembly as the centre for discussion of all matters\r\nfalling within the scope of the Charter. This Hall of\r\nuniversal representation, where the sovereign equality of\r\nStates is given full expression, retains crucial functions in\r\nfocusing the different fields of activity of the\r\nOrganization through the eyes of its 185 participants.\r\nSuch functions are only enhanced by the fact that a\r\nnumber of Working Groups are now examining, under its\r\naegis, some of the most relevant issues for our common\r\nfuture. We will have the occasion to deal individually\r\nwith each one of these subjects at the proper time and\r\nplace. We are especially looking forward to the debate on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council.\r\nAs the guiding force behind the activity of these\r\nworking groups, Mr. President, you have assumed a set of\r\nresponsibilities that are truly impressive. We reaffirm our\r\nconfidence in your capacity to orient our work towards\r\nthe most productive results, and we wish to assure you of\r\nour intention to participate actively in the efforts to make\r\nthe fiftieth session a true milestone in the evolution of\r\nthis body.\r\nAs work proceeds on “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”, “An Agenda for Peace”, reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, the financial situation and strengthening\r\nof the Organization, Member States are becoming\r\nincreasingly aware of the linkages between these\r\nexercises. Grasping this fact and all its implications is in\r\nitself a challenging task.\r\nThe report’s sub-chapter on the General Assembly\r\nindicates that the Assembly devotes less attention to\r\nregional conflicts — while pointing out that several have\r\nbeen resolved during the last decade — and that more\r\ntime is being devoted to economic and social matters and\r\nother questions. This statement deserves some comment.\r\nWhile the resolution of conflicts in some areas of the\r\nworld constitutes reason for rejoicing, a number of other\r\nserious conflicts have emerged in recent years, increasing\r\nthe workload of the Security Council and the presence of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nUnited Nations troops worldwide. More human and material\r\nresources are devoted to peace-keeping operations today\r\nthan ever before in the history of the Organization. More\r\nresources are spent on peace-keeping than on any other\r\nUnited Nations activity. No other topic on our vast agenda\r\nseems to rouse greater attention or to stir world public\r\nopinion more than the role of the United Nations in\r\ncontrolling, settling or preventing regional conflict.\r\nThe fact that the General Assembly devotes less\r\nattention to regional conflicts does not, unfortunately, result\r\nfrom success in securing international peace. As the report\r\nitself aptly acknowledges, the Security Council is meeting\r\non an almost daily basis to consider precisely these\r\nconflicts, and its deliberations have generated intensified\r\ninterest. Notwithstanding the many steps that have been\r\ntaken to increase transparency in the Council’s methods,\r\nhowever, the importance of matters pertaining to peace and\r\nsecurity is such, in the context of the Organization’s overall\r\nmandate, that a more fluid relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the general membership is clearly called for.\r\nIt might be added that the supposedly greater attention\r\nbeing accorded to economic and social matters by the\r\nGeneral Assembly does not signify that the debate on such\r\nissues is as productive as it should be. Concern with\r\ndevelopment remains largely ancillary to concern with\r\npeace and security, while the prospects afforded by the end\r\nof the cold war for a renewed partnership for development\r\nstill await clearer definition.\r\nThe report refers, in paragraph 42, to “harmony and\r\ncohesion” in the Security Council. This is undoubtedly a\r\npositive signal of growing understanding among the\r\nmembers of the Council. On the other hand, we should not\r\nbe fearful of the manifestation of diverging views when\r\ndifferences of opinion exist. If the Security Council is to act\r\non behalf of all Member States, as the Charter requires, the\r\nfull range of their views should be adequately voiced.\r\nIt seems that on certain occasions — and this is a\r\nmatter of concern — the decision-making process has been\r\nshifted to forums outside the Council itself, without the\r\nnecessary regard for transparency and accountability.\r\nMembers of the Council, troop-contributing nations and the\r\nUnited Nations membership in general have thus\r\nexperienced serious difficulties in following the\r\ndevelopment of situations in which there is a clear universal\r\ninterest.\r\nAdministrative and financial matters have acquired a\r\nnew urgency. The Organization cannot remain on the brink\r\nof bankruptcy without having its credibility eroded. As we\r\nhave maintained on different occasions, the most obvious\r\nsolution to the current financial ills of the Organization is\r\nthe prompt and full payment by Member States of their\r\nassessed contributions. We must endeavour to further\r\nrationalize the budget and aim for a more efficient\r\nmachinery. But the prospect of programmes for the\r\npromotion of economic and social development being\r\nsacrificed owing to difficulties in meeting increased\r\nexpenditure in other fields is a cause of no small concern.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s concern about the\r\ndecrease in funds for development, and we could not\r\nagree more with his call for a new vision of development\r\nand a universal commitment to it. We maintain our\r\ndeepest solidarity towards the least developed countries,\r\nparticularly those in Africa, which are in dire need of\r\nemergency assistance. We emphasize, however, the\r\ndistinction between the critical demand for resources to\r\nmitigate humanitarian or social strife and the need for a\r\ncomprehensive approach to development capable of\r\nassociating countries from the North and the South in a\r\njoint effort to stimulate growth worldwide. This is the\r\nessential task of “An Agenda for Development”.\r\nAmbassador Ricupero’s appointment to the important\r\npost of Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is\r\nmentioned in the Secretary-General’s report. We believe\r\nthat, under his guidance, UNCTAD will be in a position\r\nto play an active role in advancing the cause of\r\ndevelopment, through strategies that will help developing\r\ncountries to take full advantage of opportunities offered\r\nby trade, investment and technology flows, as well as\r\nthrough enhanced South-South cooperation.\r\nIn the period covered by the report, United Nations\r\ninitiatives in Africa have produced an undeniably positive\r\nimpact in several war-torn nations. With regard to\r\nMozambique and Angola, we are glad to note that the\r\npeace process is taking hold in these two southern African\r\ncountries with which Brazil shares a historic and cultural\r\nheritage. More recently, an agreement has also been\r\nreached between the conflicting factions in Liberia. We\r\nare hopeful that the gradual normalization of conditions\r\nin Rwanda will be consolidated into a new chapter of\r\npeace for the entire beleaguered region of the African\r\nGreat Lakes.\r\nThe economic and social rehabilitation of these\r\nnations represents a test for the Organization’s capacity to\r\nimplement sustained action aimed at post-conflict peace-\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nbuilding. In the same vein, we have been calling attention\r\nto the role that development programmes can play in the\r\ncontext of preventive diplomacy.\r\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\ndeserves credit for her untiring efforts to mobilize the\r\nagency’s emergency-response capacity and to seek\r\npreventive and solution-oriented approaches to these huge\r\nproblems.\r\nIn the disarmament area, the international community\r\nshould not presume that all problems related to weapons of\r\nmass destruction have been solved with the end of the cold\r\nwar. On the contrary, renewed efforts are necessary to\r\nsustain the momentum towards the complete elimination of\r\nthe threat of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare.\r\nThe experience accumulated by the Organization in\r\ndealing with the post-cold-war international context is of\r\ngreat value for our future endeavours. Much wisdom can be\r\nderived from the picture of the world presented by the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. Lessons are being learned that\r\nwill enable us to develop a better grasp of the realistic\r\npossibilities of the Organization’s action in the current,\r\nchanging environment. Brazil will remain closely involved\r\nin the effort to enable the United Nations to realize its full\r\npotential for peace and development in the years to come.\r\nMr. Alakwaa (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAt the outset I should like to express my delegation’s\r\nthanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, for his successful efforts in\r\npreparing his report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/50/1). We believe the report is a comprehensive and\r\nuseful document. To save the Assembly’s valuable time, I\r\nshall dwell only on paragraph 24 thereof.\r\nI should like to express our sincere thanks and deep\r\nappreciation to the Security Council for its action with\r\nregard to the tragic situation of our people — a situation\r\nthat is due to the failed separatist attempt of 1994. There is\r\nno doubt that the Council’s action was prompted by the\r\nawareness that peace and stability in the region required the\r\nprotection of our people’s natural right to preserve its\r\nnational unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The\r\nCouncil acted, in the light of that awareness, with sagacity\r\nand adroitness.\r\nI wish to underscore here what our Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Mr. Abdulkarim Al-Eryani, stated before\r\nthis august Assembly on 11 October 1995 regarding our\r\ncontinuing endeavour to promote and consolidate the\r\ndemocratic process in our country on the basis of political\r\nand economic pluralism, respect for human rights,\r\nfreedom of the press and freedom of expression. I should\r\nlike to add that we have implemented Security Council\r\nresolutions 924 (1994) and 931 (1994) and that in\r\naccordance with the general amnesty proclaimed by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Abdullah Saleh, President of the\r\nRepublic, all those who had been duped by the\r\nconspirators have now returned to the country. Only a\r\nfew of the perpetrators of the ill-fated secessionist plot\r\nremain abroad. The doors of our country remain open,\r\nhowever, to that handful. They can return to Yemen to\r\ndefend themselves against the charges brought against\r\nthem. As stated by the President of the Republic in a\r\npress conference, they can return to the country and\r\nchoose their defence counsel from outside or inside the\r\ncountry. We guarantee them a fair trial and undertake to\r\nabide by the ruling of the court.\r\nIf necessary, this Organization, as well as any other\r\nintergovernmental or non-governmental organization, can\r\nsend observers to the trials in order for such\r\nOrganizations to satisfy themselves as to the soundness of\r\nthe legal proceedings in trying the defendants. The\r\nSecretary-General could advise the Security Council to\r\nend discussion of this subject, since there is no need for\r\nthe Council to remain seized of it.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to express our\r\nsincere gratitude to the Secretary-General and to his\r\nSpecial Representative for their efforts in assisting my\r\ncountry in overcoming the consequences of the tragic\r\nsituation caused by that unfortunate secessionist attempt.\r\nI should like also to express our special appreciation to\r\nthe international community and the intergovernmental\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations which\r\nprovided humanitarian assistance to the areas of our\r\ncountry affected by the crisis. At the same time, I wish to\r\nappeal to the international community and to\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to\r\nexpedite the provision of adequate assistance to us so that\r\nwe can deal with the following challenges: the need to\r\nremedy the severe damage to our national economy and\r\ninfrastructure caused by the failed attempt; the need to\r\nremove deadly anti-personnel mines to save the lives of\r\nwomen, children and other innocent people who fall\r\nvictim to those devices daily; and, the need to cope,\r\ndespite the scarcity of our resources, with the social and\r\neconomic burden resulting from the flows into Yemen of\r\nrefugees from Somalia and some other neighbouring\r\ncountries. While we thank the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees for its efforts\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 17 October 1995\r\nin our country, we must request more support to it. We\r\nmust say, however, that we do not consider this to be an\r\nalternative to the effort the international community should\r\nmake in helping our brethren in Somalia to end the\r\ninfighting in their country, achieve national reconciliation,\r\nrestore peace and stability and rebuild their country.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item for this meeting. We shall hear the\r\nremaining speakers, including any statements in the\r\nexercise of the right of reply, under this item tomorrow\r\nmorning.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\nthe announcement of voluntary contributions to the 1996\r\nprogramme of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees will take place on Friday, 17 November, in the\r\nmorning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
