(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 11.20 a.m.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention of\r\nmembers to General Assembly resolution 49/244 of\r\n12 July 1995, by which the Assembly decided to proclaim\r\nthe World Week of Peace, beginning on 24 October 1995,\r\nin solemn commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTurning to another subject, as all members are aware,\r\nthe Special Commemorative Meeting for the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations will begin on Sunday,\r\n22 October. As we prepare for this historic event, I should\r\nlike again to impress upon delegations that their cooperation\r\nin observing rigorously the five-minute limit for each\r\nstatement is indispensable for the timely and smooth\r\nconduct of the Special Commemorative Meeting. To assist\r\nspeakers in keeping to the five-minute limit, a lighting-\r\nsignal system has been installed on the speakers’ rostrum,\r\nto the left of the speaker. Members have on their tables a\r\none-page information note entitled “Length of statements”\r\nthat explains in detail how the lighting-signal system works.\r\nI would urge all delegations to familiarize their speakers\r\nwith this system.\r\nNext, I should like to call the attention of Member\r\nStates to the subject of the exercise of the right of reply\r\nduring the Special Commemorative Meeting. As members\r\nwill recall, at its 3rd meeting, on 22 September 1995, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, taking into consideration the solemn\r\nnature of the Special Commemorative Meeting and the\r\nserious time and technical-service constraints, decided that\r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply during the\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting, if any, should be made\r\nonly in written form, to be circulated as documents. I\r\nwould be grateful for all delegations’ cooperation in this\r\nrespect.\r\nAgenda item 156\r\nMultilingualism\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.6)\r\nThe President: Before calling on the first speaker\r\non this agenda item, I should like to propose, if there is\r\nno objection, that the list of speakers for the debate on\r\nthis item be closed at 12.30 p.m. today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: (interpretation from French): I call\r\non the representative of France to introduce the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/50/L.6.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nPleased though I may be, on the occasion of its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, to hail the United Nations contribution to the\r\ndiversity of cultures, I would have much preferred not to\r\nhave to address the Assembly this morning. Indeed, none\r\nof the many sponsors of the draft resolution that I have\r\nthe honour to introduce would have taken such an\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\ninitiative if the rules laid down by the United Nations\r\nregarding the use of languages had been properly applied.\r\nHere I wish to point out that 10 Member States have been\r\nadded to list of sponsors of the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.6: Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic,\r\nEl Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Liechtenstein, Malta,\r\nOman, Vanuatu and Viet Nam.\r\nSince the adoption of the Charter, whose Article 111\r\nprovides that the versions in the several languages in which\r\nit was drafted are equally authentic, our predecessors in this\r\nHouse have constantly striven to maintain parity between\r\nthe official languages — originally numbering five, and six\r\nsince 1973, when Arabic was added to the list — and\r\nworking languages of the various bodies. To French and\r\nEnglish, which have been working languages from the start\r\nand which remain the two working languages of the\r\nSecretariat, the other official languages were successively\r\nadded as working languages of the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWe wish to support this use of several languages on\r\na basis of equality, which we call multilingualism. We must\r\nsupport it, because it is being threatened in an insidious but\r\nreal way. Indeed, no one disputes the fact that equal\r\ntreatment by the United Nations of its official and working\r\nlanguages contributes to the development of a harmonious\r\nand rich international life through the promotion of cultural\r\ndiversity.\r\nNone the less, infringements of this principle — some\r\nmore serious, some less — have frequently been noted. The\r\ncauses of such incidents are varied, but many of them occur\r\nunder the pretext of insufficient material and financial\r\nmeans. I shall offer just one recent example. At the\r\nbeginning of the current session, the General Assembly\r\ndecided that, for budgetary reasons, there would be no more\r\nnight meetings: work would stop at 6 p.m. Then delegates\r\nwere asked whether, when the fateful hour of 6 p.m.\r\narrived, they would be willing to continue to work without\r\ninterpretation, because in accordance with the General\r\nAssembly’s decision, interpreters would not be available\r\nafter that hour. This is a typical example of how a decision\r\ncan be distorted. Conference services are not limited to\r\ninterpretation services, but in such cases people\r\nautomatically think of cutting those services to save money.\r\nThis is but one of many situations in which\r\ndelegations committed to plurilingualism must come\r\nforward, sometimes in unpleasant circumstances, to remind\r\npeople of the fundamental right of States Members of the\r\nOrganization to work in the official language of their\r\nchoice and to have timely documentation in that language.\r\nA great deal of will and determination is required for\r\nus to stick to the well-founded rule of respect for the\r\nprinciples of equality of languages. The anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations provides us with another opportunity to\r\nregain control and refuse to go down the slippery slope of\r\nmonolingualism, a practice which some people secretly\r\nfeel would be a factor for simplification and savings, but\r\nwhich would actually engender a weakening of dialogue,\r\na lack of interest in the United Nations and the unbridled\r\ndevelopment of bureaucracy and stereotypes.\r\nThe draft resolution on multilingualism, sponsored\r\nby some 68 States, is a way to respond, first of all, to the\r\nunacceptable reduction of budgets for translation and\r\ninterpretation in recent years, precisely when the need for\r\nsuch services is constantly growing in all sectors of\r\nUnited Nations activities.\r\nThese services, however, are not the only ones\r\ninvolved. It is important that the Secretariat staff’s\r\nlanguage proficiency make possible a genuine circulation\r\nof information, documents, reports and studies in various\r\nlanguages. This factor must be taken into account in the\r\nrecruitment and promotion of staff, for it is pointless to\r\noffer delegations a multilingual service if the heart of the\r\nOrganization is not beating in time with that goal and if\r\nthe Secretariat is unable to benefit from the various\r\ncontributions available to it.\r\nFinally, the teaching of languages must remain a\r\npriority in the policy of ongoing training for Secretariat\r\nstaff.\r\nToday more than ever we are persuaded that the\r\nfuture of the United Nations does not lie in abandoning\r\nthe linguistic resources which are its wealth. We recently\r\nhad outstanding examples of the road to take. The\r\nPresident’s introductory statement, which gave an equal\r\nshare to several official languages of the Organization,\r\nwas a good augury for work on this agenda item. The\r\naddress delivered a few days ago by His Holiness the\r\nPope, which made use of each of the official languages,\r\nprovided the Assembly with, I believe, very stirring\r\ninspiration. Now it is up to us to implement this spirit of\r\nexchange and dialogue, which everyone feels is needed at\r\nthe dawn of the next 50 years of the United Nations.\r\nBut this will not result from mere solemn statements.\r\nResolute, constant, stubborn action, unswerving will and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nunremitting determination are needed. All of us together\r\nmust show that we are capable of doing this. The adoption\r\nof the draft resolution before the General Assembly will\r\nhelp us in this, and that is why I warmly commend this text\r\nto the attention of all delegations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Argentina also to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.6.\r\nMr. Sersale di Cerisano (Argentina) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I have the honour to address this Assembly\r\non behalf of the 21 countries members of the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Summit: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,\r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal,\r\nUruguay and Venezuela. The 21 countries of the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Summit, who are among the sponsors of draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.6, support the text before the Assembly,\r\nwhich was submitted in both Spanish and French.\r\nParagraph 17 of the Bariloche Declaration, adopted\r\nonly a few days ago, on 17 October, by the 21 Heads of\r\nState of the Ibero-American Summit, states:\r\n“Since the Ibero-American cultural heritage and its\r\nmeans of expression constitute a common heritage for\r\nour nations, it is indispensable to protect and promote\r\nit in all possible forums, especially in those\r\norganizations, agencies and institutions where it is an\r\nofficial language”.\r\nInspired by this thought of our Heads of State, we\r\nhave endeavoured to promote this organization’s use of the\r\nsix official languages which, for us, stand on an equal\r\nfooting in terms of the treatment of the Members of this\r\nOrganization. What we mean to propose is that we comply\r\nwith decisions that have been adopted over the last 50 years\r\nof the history of this Organization. In other words, the\r\noriginal five, and now, with the addition of Arabic, six\r\nlanguages must be treated on the same level. But we are\r\nfacing a different development. For questions of practicality\r\nand for the sake of efficiency, quite often this enriching\r\ndiversity is neglected. And this marks a trend that we\r\nwould wish to avoid.\r\nThe proposal of the countries of the Ibero-American\r\nSummit and the other sponsors has no budgetary\r\nimplications. We are simply seeking to ensure compliance\r\nwith what Member States have decided. Therefore, invite\r\nMember States and request the Secretary-General to ensure\r\nthe strict implementation of the resolutions establishing\r\nlanguage arrangements for the United Nations, about\r\nwhich we give all necessary data in the preambular part\r\nof the draft resolution. This, of course, has implications\r\nwith respect to recruitment, because we wish this\r\ntreatment of the six languages to be reflected in the\r\nOrganization’s recruitment policies.\r\nAlso in the operative part, we address the\r\nSecretariat, urging it to take these provisions into\r\nconsideration when it comes to recruitment and\r\npromotion. This has implications in other areas also: in\r\nthe field of training, where we are very much concerned\r\nthat we do not see equal treatment in the teaching of the\r\nsix official languages. We call upon the Assembly to\r\nensure that this not continue and that existing provisions\r\nbe followed.\r\nA further point of concern to us and which we wish\r\nto try to remedy goes beyond Headquarters. Since the\r\nUnited Nations, through its documentation, materials and\r\nscientific and technological research, disseminates a great\r\ndeal of material, is that high-calibre knowledge produced\r\nhere and throughout the system disseminated in all\r\nofficial languages? Who has access to that work and that\r\ndocumentation? It is our university researchers, our\r\ntechnicians and our students at all levels of education; and\r\nthis is the very soul of how the work of the United\r\nNations is absorbed in our countries.\r\nWe, the sponsors of this draft resolution, want to\r\nensure that the work of the United Nations, which\r\ncontributes to all areas that enhance the well-being of\r\nmankind, will be disseminated in the official languages so\r\nthat the work of this Organization may be properly\r\ncarried out in all Member and observer countries.\r\nI repeat that this draft resolution does not have\r\nbudgetary implications. It should be considered as seeking\r\nto fulfil decisions we have taken. Consistent with our own\r\ndecisions with respect to rationalization of the work of the\r\nAssembly, we propose a review of this matter within two\r\nyears.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe draft resolution on multilingualism that is before the\r\nAssembly reminds us, following another series of\r\ninitiatives of the same nature, that our Organization is not\r\na monolithic being, a soulless bureaucracy, but a living\r\norganism within which human beings — men and women\r\nfrom different regions of the world, heirs to rich and\r\nhistoric cultures — are brought together to collaborate on\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nan equal footing, while respecting the values and principles\r\nproclaimed by the United Nations Charter. The world, in its\r\ndiversity and richness, is thus associated with the action of\r\nthe United Nations. This association cannot and must not\r\never be based on exclusion.\r\nNow, linguistic impoverishment, like any other form\r\nof impoverishment, does involve exclusion. We note this in\r\nthe economic and social area, with poverty, and in the area\r\nof education, with illiteracy. We note it also in the scientific\r\narea, where there is a growing gap between those who have\r\naccess to knowledge and progress and those excluded from\r\nthese things. Consequently, it seems more than ever\r\nessential to ensure that this Organization, now 50 years old,\r\ndoes not find itself cut off from an important source of its\r\nwealth and its interest — that is to say, from its\r\nuniversality.\r\nMultilingualism is one of the foundations of the\r\nUnited Nations — indeed, its very essence. It is one of the\r\nexpressions of the Organization’s universal character — the\r\nmajor element in a multilateral and multidisciplinary\r\ndialogue between nations in the service of peace and\r\neconomic and social development, as well as the promotion\r\nof human rights and public freedoms.\r\nThere would be a sort of misunderstanding, but also\r\nof contempt for cultures, amounting to culpable negligence\r\nvis-à-vis modes of thought and intellectual and\r\nphilosophical concepts of the world, if we were not to use\r\nthe official languages, so fortunately, so wisely bestowed on\r\nthe Organization, and which are one of its most beautiful\r\nforms of expression. To our way of thinking, this usage is\r\nan area of respect for “the other” and for others — for our\r\ndifferences, which constitute our wealth and the very source\r\nof harmonious and balanced international collaboration\r\nbetween sovereign States.\r\nAs this Organization celebrates its jubilee, should we\r\nnot, rather, confirm its international dimension and commit\r\nourselves to respect for the will expressed by its Member\r\nStates, which recognized the following as official and\r\nworking languages — Spanish in 1948, Russian in 1968,\r\nChinese and Arabic in 1973 — having, at the creation of\r\nthe Organization, established English and French as official\r\nand working languages of the Secretariat? In this regard, let\r\nus also recall that, according to article 111 of the Charter,\r\nthe Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish texts of\r\nthe Charter are equally authentic.\r\nThis constitutional obligation and respect for the\r\ndecisions of the General Assembly are imposed on us\r\nunreservedly, and they must apply both at the level of\r\nbodies and at the level of meetings, including informal\r\nones, and within the Secretariat and in relations with\r\nMember States. This, in our view, is not just a matter of\r\nprinciple but also a matter of quality and effectiveness,\r\nbecause the wealth, the nuances and the fullness of oral\r\nor written expression are authentic and convincing only\r\nwhen conceived and put forward in the mother tongue or\r\nin a language learned in school or university. Claude\r\nLevi-Strauss, whose thinking transformed man’s vision of\r\nman, reminded us that language is an aspect of human\r\nreason which has its own reasons, and that man does not\r\nunderstand that.\r\nConsequently, the draft resolution before the\r\nAssembly is of extreme importance to the Government of\r\nMonaco. It is not an administrative text inspired by some\r\npurely bureaucratic or formal reflex. On the contrary, it\r\ntouches upon the very nature of this Organization — its\r\nmultilateral character, its universal, international\r\ndimension, its roots and its foundations. Now, the most\r\nbeautiful of plants cannot survive if its roots die, and the\r\nmost solid of buildings cannot stand for long when its\r\nfoundations are fragile or deficient.\r\nTo me it seems perfectly justifiable, to avoid any\r\nsuch failure, for the United Nations this year, forcefully\r\nand with conviction, to recall its commitment to one of its\r\nirreplaceable sources of wealth, its multilingualism. That\r\nis why the delegation of Monaco invites the Assembly to\r\nadopt draft resolution A/50/L.6 of which the Principality\r\nof Monaco is one of the sponsors.\r\nMr. Adechi (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nDiversity is a defining characteristic of all human groups.\r\nWe must accept it and recognize it as a manifestation of\r\nfreedom. In these times, when science, technology,\r\ncommunications and data processing are giving rise to\r\nprofound changes in the very structure of knowledge and\r\nin our individual and collective destinies, it is essential\r\nnot to lose sight of the fact that universal culture is\r\ndiverse.\r\nIt is on the basis of this concern that Benin has\r\njoined numerous other delegations in sponsoring draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.6, on multilingualism. Our purpose is\r\nto restore respect for the principle of the equality of the\r\nofficial languages of the Organization and of the working\r\nlanguages of the Secretariat — in short, to ensure\r\nobservance of the principle of diversity of languages and\r\ncultures within the United Nations system.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nThe impact of language goes far beyond the realm of\r\ncommunication. It also enhances cultural heritage and\r\nintellectual experience. Language is the means and the\r\nproduct of culture as the tool of thought. This is why, as\r\nwe come to create new avenues for international\r\ncooperation and social progress, we consider it important\r\nthat all players be in a position to make their own\r\ncontribution to the maturation and consolidation of\r\nprinciples that will serve as the foundation of international\r\nrelations. This purpose can be pursued dynamically and can\r\nproduce meaningful results only if the movement supporting\r\nit encourages respect for the cultural identity of its\r\nmembers, safeguarding pluralism and drawing nourishment\r\nfrom the richness of that diversity. It is in this way that our\r\ngreat ideals will benefit from the broadest possible support.\r\nThe United Nations is the sole universal forum for\r\ndialogue, consultation and negotiation. Our aim should be\r\nto facilitate strict respect for the right to make oneself\r\nunderstood and to understand others, because proper\r\nunderstanding of the issues being debated is our best\r\nassurance of the richest and most productive participation.\r\nI wish also to emphasize the importance that we attach\r\nto this draft resolution by stressing that, today, the players\r\nin international life are growing in number and in diversity.\r\nWe must therefore act urgently to achieve ever greater\r\ndemocratization of international life. We believe that the\r\nopportunity to express oneself and to participate contributes\r\nto that democratization by taking into account the points of\r\nview and concerns of the “silent” — those who are reduced\r\nto silence or who remain silent because they cannot\r\nparticipate actively in debates or make good use of the\r\ndocumentation available to them.\r\nFor all these reasons I am convinced that this draft\r\nresolution will be welcomed and will be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Moubarak (Lebanon) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Lebanon is a country where, in addition to the\r\nofficial language, Arabic, foreign languages are widely\r\nspoken. French and English are common languages which\r\nthe great majority of Lebanese learn and use from their\r\nearliest days at school and in universities and their everyday\r\nlife. Public and private primary education teaches French\r\nand English along with Arabic. In our universities, those\r\ntwo languages are also used for technical and literary\r\ncourses.\r\nOur country, a coastal State of the Mediterranean, is\r\nprivileged to have invented and disseminated the world’s\r\nfirst alphabet. We have therefore always understood that\r\nthe use of several languages is a source of enrichment,\r\nhelping people to grasp nuances of meaning in a\r\nManichean world that tends to over-systematize values to\r\nthe detriment of a perception of reality. That is why my\r\ndelegation is a sponsor of the draft resolution before us.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, there is a need to set the record straight by\r\nstressing the equal importance that the official and\r\nworking languages of the General Assembly should enjoy\r\nin international life. It is essential to ensure that the\r\nvarious official and working languages be used in equal\r\nmeasure within the United Nations.\r\nIt is common knowledge that there is a growing\r\nimbalance, to the disadvantage of certain official and\r\nworking languages, in particular through the systematic\r\ndelay recorded in the issue of documents. We propose\r\nthat the imbalance we have noted be corrected; in order\r\nto do so, certain measures must be taken to give effect to\r\nthe concept of the universality of the United Nations\r\nthrough its corollary, multilingualism. It is necessary that\r\nthe same opportunities be available to each Member State\r\nof the Organization, regardless of its official or working\r\nlanguages, to understand and express itself on the issues\r\nbefore it without hindrance.\r\nMultilingualism is the concrete manifestation through\r\nlanguage of a continuing enrichment through the shades\r\nof meaning specific to the sensibility of each culture. It is\r\ntherefore clear why it is imperative to tackle the\r\nshortcomings evident in the inadequate functioning of\r\nmultilingualism in our Organization. Our purpose goes\r\nbeyond coldly theoretical and calculated egalitarianism in\r\nthe use of official or working languages. Rather, it\r\npertains to the richness, complexity and diversity of\r\nhumanity itself.\r\nIt is by restoring the effective and harmonious use of\r\nlanguages within our Organization that we can do the\r\ninternational community a great service and provide every\r\nopportunity to delegations and representatives to\r\nunderstand and express concepts and values in all their\r\nfullness in their mother tongue or the language of their\r\nchoice, with the sole aim of better realizing the purposes\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The inclusion on the General Assembly’s agenda\r\nof the item on multilingualism undoubtedly reflects the\r\ngrowing interest of many delegations. It is, in fact, the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nmanifestation of the increasing importance of the role of\r\nlanguage to international relations. Given an insufficiently\r\neffective and systematic use of languages within the United\r\nNations, this is the proper place for the issue to be\r\nconsidered. Many Member countries are increasingly\r\nconcerned that the numerous resolutions and other rules\r\ngoverning the linguistic regime in the various United\r\nNations bodies be reflected in the parity of languages and\r\nthe best available interpretation and translation services.\r\nWe must acknowledge the fact that the official and\r\nworking languages are used unequally within our\r\nOrganization. Faced with this situation, Member States have\r\nrepeatedly drawn the attention of the Secretariat officials\r\nconcerned to this problem, which is becoming more and\r\nmore disturbing. Indeed, the importance of this matter is\r\nreflected in the number of decisions and resolutions that\r\nhave been adopted in this regard without ever achieving\r\ntheir desired aims. The celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations therefore seems to us to\r\nbe a propitious occasion to reaffirm our earlier decisions,\r\nbut especially to seek ways of putting them into practice.\r\nThe universality of the United Nations requires that\r\neach Member State have the opportunity to express itself in\r\nthe official language of its choice and to make itself\r\nunderstood in that language without discrimination or\r\nhindrance. Over and above the needs of communication, the\r\nparity of languages — particularly the working languages\r\nof the Secretariat — is also a source of major concern to\r\nmany delegations. That is why it is necessary to ensure that\r\nthis long-sought parity at last be reflected in the recruitment\r\nof staff and in their methods of work.\r\nThe interpenetration of cultures fostered by the\r\nremarkable progress that has been achieved in modern\r\ncommunications has reduced distances and differences. The\r\nworld of today, which we call the “global village”, needs\r\nunderstanding and mutual cooperation among peoples and\r\nnations more than ever before. In this respect, languages\r\ncontinue to play a pre-eminent role as the key to all mutual\r\nunderstanding, the universal basis of peace and harmony.\r\nMy delegation is therefore happy to support the draft\r\nresolution on multilingualism and calls on all other\r\ndelegations to support it.\r\nMr. Daouda Diabate (Côte d’Ivoire) (Interpretation\r\nfrom French): I am happy to be able to speak for the\r\nsecond time on behalf of my country, Côte d’Ivoire, before\r\nthis noble and historic commemorative session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, in order to address a\r\nsubject of extreme importance: the draft resolution on\r\nmultilingualism.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, a sponsor of this draft resolution,\r\nwould like to recall that multilingualism, whose\r\nimportance for the future development of the\r\nOrganization’s activities and its Member States was\r\nperceived and stressed so appropriately by the founders of\r\nour Organization from the start, far from being a factor\r\nfor discord and division, in fact allows the United Nations\r\nto be enriched by our diversity and our differences.\r\nIn this regard, a quick review of the documents\r\nshows how long this matter has been with us. It is\r\naddressed by resolutions dating back to 1946 and 1966,\r\nto mention only two.\r\nParadoxically, despite this long history, the issue of\r\nmultilingualism is as acute and timely as ever. Thus, on\r\n20 December 1966, the General Assembly, in its\r\nresolution on multilingualism, requested the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\r\n“to study the methods which should be used to\r\nensure a more equitable use of the working\r\nlanguages of the Organization and a better balance\r\namong those languages in the recruitment of staff at\r\nall levels, and in particular at the higher levels, of\r\nthe Secretariat, and to include his conclusions on\r\nthis question in his future reports” (resolution\r\n2241 B (XXI), operative paragraph).\r\nNo one could challenge the relevance of this request\r\nto the current situation. Although it dates from 1966, it\r\ncould validly be inserted into the draft resolution we are\r\ndebating today. That simple fact is enough to tell us how\r\noverriding is the need to move forward in adopting and\r\nimplementing our resolutions.\r\nNeither the difficulties of the moment, nor the\r\nstructural problems of the United Nations, which have\r\noften led representatives and others who work at the\r\nOrganization to agree to work in a language other than\r\ntheir official or working languages, should allow the\r\nelevation into a principle of a situation born a priori of\r\ncompromise. Otherwise, in the long term, this would lead\r\nto the certain impoverishment of our Organization which,\r\nby virtue of the cultural and linguistic diversity it\r\ncomprises, constitutes a true source of wealth.\r\nIn the light of this observation, my delegation feels\r\nthat the commemorative session of the fiftieth anniversary\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nof the United Nations should present an opportunity to\r\nreaffirm the fundamental importance of the diversity of\r\ncultures, as well as the need to practice multilingualism\r\nwithin the United Nations in order to ensure the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of international life.\r\nConsequently, the delegation of Côte d’Ivoire, a\r\nsponsor of the draft resolution on multilingualism, invites\r\nthe Assembly to adopt it by consensus.\r\nMr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Spain supports the views that\r\nhave been expressed in this debate by the delegation of\r\nArgentina, as representative of the country now acting as\r\ninterim Secretary of the Ibero-American Conference.\r\nArticle 1, paragraph 4 of the Charter defines our\r\nOrganization as a centre for “harmonizing the actions of\r\nnations in the attainment of these common ends” of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThat is the foundation for the universal orientation that\r\ncharacterizes this Organization, whose practical reflection\r\nlies in the fact that 185 Member States are represented\r\ntoday in the General Assembly.\r\nSo established, the mission of harmonizing the diverse\r\naims of States within the setting of the United Nations has\r\na corollary, which is the need to articulate a dialogue\r\namong us all which, if it is to be fruitful, must be informed\r\nby the cultural pluralism that the Members of the\r\nOrganization bring to their work.\r\nThe General Assembly which, indeed, could not have\r\ndone less, supported this necessity in one of its first\r\ndecisions by adopting, in resolution 2 (I) of its first session,\r\non 1 February 1946, the rules of procedure of the General\r\nAssembly, which laid down as official languages in United\r\nNations organs Chinese, English, French, Russian and\r\nSpanish. Two years later, resolution 262 (III) of 11\r\nDecember 1948 established Spanish as a working language,\r\nas well as English and French. Reaffirming its commitment\r\nto the diversity of cultures represented in the United\r\nNations, the General Assembly extended to Russian in 1968\r\nand to Arabic and Chinese in 1973 the status of official and\r\nworking languages of the General Assembly.\r\nThus, at present, Spanish, together with Arabic,\r\nChinese, English, French and Russian, are the official and\r\nworking languages of the General Assembly and its\r\nCommittees and Subcommittees, as well as of the Security\r\nCouncil and other organs of the United Nations.\r\nAccordingly, the conditions required not only for the\r\nenrichment of deliberations within our Organization, but\r\nalso for public opinion in our countries to feel able to\r\nidentify with our work seem to have been met.\r\nFor my country, Spain, which lives in linguistic\r\npluralism in its own society, the defence and\r\nstrengthening of the principle of the use of different\r\nofficial languages in our work and deliberations takes on\r\na particular importance.\r\nIn this respect, and as far as Spanish is concerned,\r\nmy delegation wishes to reiterate its firm desire that the\r\nSecretariat should take great care to apply the provisions\r\npertaining not only to the effective and reliable translation\r\nof official documents and the prompt distribution of such\r\ndocuments once translated, but also to the need for\r\navailability of interpretation services in the various\r\nofficial languages at all meetings that require them.\r\nLikewise, it is particularly important to my\r\ndelegation that the Organization, when it recruits\r\npersonnel, should ensure that such personnel have a\r\ncommand of and use at least one of the six official\r\nlanguages of the United Nations. This, of course, should\r\nbe supplemented by ensuring the continued training of\r\nsuch professional staff in the knowledge of the official\r\nand working languages.\r\nMoreover, my delegation believes it important to\r\nensure that the present courses for the teaching of\r\nSpanish, as well as those for the other official and\r\nworking languages, should at all levels remain able to\r\nrespond to the clear interest in knowing a language that\r\nis spoken by hundreds of millions of people.\r\nAlso, aware of the need for our Governments and\r\nour citizens to have the necessary information regarding\r\nthe work of the United Nations, my delegation believes\r\nthat the Organization’s archive and library services and its\r\ndata banks must be available for use in all the official\r\nlanguages.\r\nMy delegation, of course, is aware of the financial\r\ndifficulties our Organization is experiencing. However, we\r\nbelieve that this cannot be an argument for the obvious\r\nintellectual impoverishment and concomitant loss of\r\neffectiveness for the United Nations that would result\r\nfrom a careless application of the Organization’s current\r\nlanguage arrangements.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nThese are the reasons that have prompted the Spanish\r\ndelegation to lend its support to the request for inclusion on\r\nthe agenda of this session of an additional item entitled\r\n“Multilingualism”, which is under consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly today.\r\nI wish to underscore that for my country it was a\r\nsource of special satisfaction to sign this request, together\r\nwith all the other States members of the Ibero-American\r\nConference. It is an additional source of satisfaction that,\r\non the eve of the session that brings us together today, the\r\nIbero-American Summit, meeting in Bariloche, Argentina,\r\naffirmed, in the solemn Declaration adopted there by the\r\nHeads of State and Government of Ibero-American\r\ncountries, that it is indispensable to protect and promote\r\nSpanish in those organizations, agencies and international\r\ninstitutions in which it has official status, as is obviously\r\nthe case with the United Nations.\r\nThe delegation of Spain, which is among the sponsors\r\nof draft resolution A/50/L.6, trusts that this text will be\r\nfavourably received by the Assembly, as merited by its\r\ncontent and its broad sponsorship.\r\nMrs. Decerega-Smith (Panama) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation supports the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Argentina on behalf of the Ibero-American\r\nConference.\r\nMy delegation will base its statement on the item\r\nentitled “Multilingualism” on a letter written 25 years ago\r\nto the Secretary-General of the United Nations by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Panama. Ambassador Illueca,\r\nwho holds the same post now as he did then, indicated in\r\nthat letter that he was among the Spanish-speaking Latin\r\nAmerican representatives who at one stage embarked upon\r\na campaign to ensure that the use of Spanish should be\r\nadopted in the interpretation and documentation services on\r\nan equal footing with the other working languages of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its organs.\r\nAmbassador Illueca also said that he was alluding to\r\nthat campaign in order to emphasize his concern at the fact\r\nthat such use on an equal footing was not being observed,\r\nas well as his view that much remained to be done and that\r\nfinancial and other difficulties did not justify failure to\r\ncomply with the various resolutions the General Assembly\r\nhad adopted with respect to the use of languages in the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMoreover, he stressed that he did not wish a concern\r\npertaining to a cultural consideration to appear in a political\r\nlight. As a Latin American, his concern was based on\r\nelements such as the need of the United Nations to find\r\nthe means to achieve linguistic internationalism.\r\nInternationalism in the United Nations is interculturalism.\r\nThat feature is directly linked to the foundations and\r\npurposes of the United Nations, and the oral and written\r\nword is the most immediate instrument to bring out the\r\nfull value of each culture. An international organization\r\nwith the calling of the United Nations would be\r\nthreatened with impoverishment if it spoke and wrote but\r\na single language.\r\nAmbassador Illueca went on to say in his letter that\r\nLatin America, by virtue of the characteristics of its\r\nphysical and spiritual development, presented a case of\r\nexceptional linguistic unification. The search for Latin\r\nAmerican expression was achieved through a cultural\r\nmelting pot, to which its oral and written language is\r\nfaithful testimony. If appropriate use is not made of\r\nSpanish in the United Nations, representatives of a culture\r\nof which this language is a fundamental part cannot\r\nparticipate equitably. To impose on us a single language,\r\nwhich is not ours, would be to disregard the fact that\r\nlanguage is an instrument of dialogue and therefore\r\nconstitutes an essential instrument in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThose are some of the points set out in Ambassador\r\nIllueca’s letter. My delegation believes that everything\r\nsaid there remains valid today.\r\nWith the passage of time, other languages have\r\nachieved the right of expression in the United Nations.\r\nThis Organization must be consistent with the\r\nmultilingualism that is its nature. A few days ago, His\r\nHoliness Pope John Paul II reminded us that there is a\r\nsovereignty based on culture, and that for all States\r\nMembers of the Organization to be able to exercise that\r\nsovereignty in the United Nations requires that all\r\nofficially recognized languages should find the broadest\r\npossible room for expression.\r\nPanama has held this position for many years, in\r\nNew York as in other specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system. In this we have had the support of the\r\nother Latin American delegations and of the delegation of\r\nSpain, the country from which we inherited a language on\r\nwhich we have made our own mark.\r\nMy delegation trusts that the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/50/L.6 will be adopted and that\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nits application will be a task of the greatest importance to\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMr. Nothomb (Belgium) (interpretation from French):\r\nBelgium is happy to be able to sponsor the draft resolution\r\non multilingualism, which the representative of France just\r\npresented today. We feel, indeed, that this matter is an\r\nimportant one. Belgium is not only among the 44 countries\r\nthat speak French; it is itself a multilingual country.\r\nBelgium in fact has three official languages, corresponding\r\nto the three linguistic communities which make it up. Both\r\nhistory and experience have shown us that respect for\r\nmultilingualism, based on the equality of official languages,\r\nis a factor for communication and for drawing people\r\ntogether. It is also a crucial factor in our unity. If my\r\ncountry finds that this is an important element at the\r\nnational level, the logic of its necessity at the international\r\nlevel becomes quite obvious.\r\nThe diversity of cultures finds expression in the United\r\nNations, in particular, through the equality among official\r\nand working languages. This testifies to the respect which\r\nthis Organization accords to the expression of the dominant\r\ncultures of this planet, which is a guarantee of a better\r\nunderstanding of others, of greater esteem, of better\r\nappreciation of what we all have in common. Each\r\nlanguage, indeed, is imbued with its own particular spirit,\r\na certain vision of the world that would of necessity be\r\ndiminished if it could not be expressed.\r\nBelgium thought that it was appropriate in the year of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations for this\r\nprinciple to be recalled because it has noted with regret that\r\nit was not always adequately respected. While the pressure\r\nof the moment has at times justified this, we find that\r\nsituations that should have remained the exceptions are\r\ntending to become the rule, and that it is more and more\r\ncommon for documents not to be available in time in all\r\nthe official languages, or for the interpretation services to\r\nbe unable to keep up with the multiplication of informal\r\nmeetings.\r\nA certain flexibility has often been shown in this\r\nrespect. Even though this may be usual, it should not make\r\nus forget the principle which this draft resolution is\r\nintended to recall and repeat. The fact that the\r\nrepresentatives of our Governments here at the United\r\nNations generally speak English should not make us forget\r\nthat the people in our capitals need to be informed as\r\nquickly as possible in the language they know, in order to\r\nreact promptly.\r\nThe story of the Tower of Babel does not need to be\r\nrecounted in detail to show the importance of this\r\nprinciple. To be sure, sometimes one might feel that the\r\nUnited Nations seems to produce an enormous volume of\r\nwords, and so one might question their proliferation in\r\nseveral languages. The fact is that words have value, as\r\nthis Assembly is well aware. If certain words that now\r\nhave universal currency and acceptance have acquired\r\ntheir meaning and substance as a result of our\r\ndiscussions, it is precisely because of this juxtaposition of\r\ndiffering or similar interpretations given to them by the\r\nparticular vision of the various languages that define\r\nthem. These languages are the reflection not only of a\r\nculture, but also of a history and a state of mind; they are\r\nintegral parts of a patrimony.\r\nThe United Nations must remain the guardian of this\r\nwealth of dialogue which it wishes to foster. Otherwise,\r\nit would be failing in its calling as a universal body. It\r\nalso would run the risk of being less highly regarded from\r\nthe outside. Moreover, it is important for its message to\r\nbe understood by public opinion. This calling should not\r\nbe compromised by practical and financial considerations.\r\nIf that were so, the United Nations would in a way lose\r\nits soul: indeed, to communicate is to nurture a way of\r\nthinking that has many shapes and facets, but reaches to\r\nthe widest possible horizons and is based on tolerance.\r\nMr. Kumamaru (Japan): Before making this\r\nstatement, I would like to note that the delegations of the\r\nRepublic of Korea and Thailand wish to associate\r\nthemselves with the views it contains.\r\nThe delegation of Japan would like to draw the\r\nattention of the Assembly to paragraph 3 of the draft\r\nresolution, in which the General Assembly requests the\r\nSecretary-General to ensure that personnel recruited by\r\nthe different bodies of the Organization have a command\r\nand use at least one of the six official languages, in\r\naddition to one working language of the Secretariat. In\r\nour view, requiring a command of two of the six official\r\nlanguages would discriminate excessively against\r\npersonnel whose mother tongue is not one of these\r\nlanguages. Consideration must be given to personnel not\r\nborn into cultures that utilize one of the official United\r\nNations languages, and therefore do not benefit from the\r\ncurrent language arrangements. Already at a disadvantage,\r\nthey should not be required to have command of yet\r\nanother foreign language.\r\nMy delegation supports the idea that the United\r\nNations should promote cultural diversity. To do that,\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nhowever, it should avoid unfairly penalizing those cultures\r\nnot associated with the six official languages of this\r\nOrganization. Japan therefore proposes the following\r\namendments, and recommends that the decision on the draft\r\nresolution be postponed until informal consultations are\r\nheld.\r\nFirst, we propose that the word “ensure” in the first\r\nline of paragraph 3 be replaced by the word “encourage”.\r\nAnd secondly, at the end of paragraph 3 of the draft\r\nresolution, the following language should be added: “taking\r\ninto account the difficulties faced by personnel whose\r\nmother tongue is not one of the official languages”.\r\nMrs. Teo-Jacob (Singapore): My country is perhaps\r\nfortunate that two of the official United Nations languages,\r\nEnglish and Chinese, are also two of the official languages\r\nof Singapore. This draft resolution, if passed, will not affect\r\nus too much one way or another. We therefore speak with\r\nsome objectivity and with no vested interests.\r\n(spoke in Chinese)\r\nWe have no vested interests.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIt is from this standpoint that we would like to seek\r\nclarification on a few points before any action is taken. Our\r\nconcerns relate in particular to paragraph 3. As drafted,\r\nparagraph 3 suggests that there is a clear difference\r\nbetween the official languages and the working languages\r\nof the United Nations. However, as we all know, rule 51 of\r\nthe rules of procedure of the General Assembly makes it\r\nvery clear that Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian\r\nand Spanish are both official and working languages of the\r\nUnited Nations. This point is in fact plainly stated in the\r\nfourth preambular paragraph of the draft resolution.\r\nIt is therefore all the more puzzling why paragraph 3\r\nexpresses this simple point in such an obscure, convoluted\r\nand indeed misleading way. If recast in plain English, what\r\nparagraph 3 is saying is simply that the Secretary-General\r\nshould ensure that personnel recruited by the United\r\nNations should know two official languages of the United\r\nNations. This simple point has been obscured by the use of\r\ndeliberately opaque language. I hope it was only a mistake\r\nof drafting.\r\nThere is another crucial ambiguity in paragraph 3.\r\nThis is in the phrase “personnel recruited”. As now drafted,\r\nit is unclear whether the phrase refers to personnel that will\r\nbe recruited in the future, or whether it refers to personnel\r\nthat have already been recruited and are now working in\r\nthe United Nations. Without qualification, the phrase\r\n“personnel recruited” could well refer to past, present or\r\nfuture. There are problems in any case. Are we to\r\nunderstand that people who have already been recruited\r\nby the United Nations who are not so fortunate as to\r\nknow two official languages should therefore have their\r\nappointments terminated forthwith by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral? If such a harsh measure is not contemplated, is\r\nit therefore the intention of the draft resolution that these\r\nunfortunates should be retrained by the Secretariat, as\r\nseems to be implied by the eighth preambular paragraph?\r\nIf so, where will funds for this retraining come from?\r\nIf the phrase “personnel recruited” is intended to\r\nrefer to personnel that will be recruited in the future, then\r\nthe effect of this draft resolution, if it is passed, will be\r\nto systematically and systemically discriminate against\r\nnationals of countries not so fortunate as to have any of\r\nthe official United Nations languages as their native\r\nlanguages. If nationals of these countries should aspire to\r\nwork for the United Nations, they will face the daunting\r\ntask of learning two new languages. Few may qualify.\r\nThis would be a grave injustice, particularly since\r\nmost of the countries that are in this unfortunate situation\r\nwould be the smaller and less developed countries. By\r\nand large, it will be nationals of the advanced developed\r\ncountries, particularly those from Europe — and I would\r\nlike to point out that four out of the six official United\r\nNations languages are European languages — who would\r\nhenceforth have the best chance of being recruited by the\r\nUnited Nations. This would detract from the universal and\r\nmulticultural character of the United Nations. I hope that\r\nthis is not the intention of this draft resolution.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating that Singapore has no\r\nvested interest in this issue. But precisely because we\r\nhave been able to take an objective look at this matter, we\r\nhave concluded that this is not as simple or\r\nstraightforward an issue as it might seem at first glance.\r\nWe suggest that before we take any action on this draft\r\nresolution, the Secretariat should clarify the points I have\r\nraised and all delegations should be given more time to\r\nreflect on the Secretariat’s answers. The United Nations\r\nhas operated for 50 years with its present language\r\narrangements. A pause for reflection will do the\r\nOrganization no harm. On the other hand, we may well\r\nregret precipitate action.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nTunisia’s belief that openness to the outside world enriches\r\nthe various cultures of the world, draws peoples together\r\nand contributes to overcoming factors of division and\r\nconfrontation. At the level of the United Nations, such\r\nopenness finds expression in the coexistence and harmony\r\nthat we seek between the official and working languages\r\napproved by the Charter.\r\nTunisia, with its age-old civilization which has always\r\nbeen characterized by moderation, is in favour of\r\nmaintaining and strengthening the humanitarian and\r\nspiritual principles upon which the United Nations was\r\nfounded and is in favour also of strengthening cultural and\r\nhumanitarian interaction between communities.\r\nAt the domestic level, and in the interests of cultural\r\nopenness to our neighbours in the north of the\r\nMediterranean basin, Tunisia has concluded agreements\r\nwith both Italy and France to enable Tunisian citizens to\r\nreceive certain television broadcasts from those two friendly\r\ncountries. There is no doubt that the accelerating\r\ntechnological progress in the areas of communications and\r\nculture will contribute greatly to reducing distances, to\r\npropagating ideas, to bringing the peoples of the region\r\ncloser together and, thereby, to eliminating any\r\ncontradictions that may set them apart.\r\nAt the external level, Tunisia has focused on\r\npromoting harmonious relations with other countries in\r\nconsonance with an ever-renewed vision and with principles\r\nthat are bound to open up promising vistas for peoples on\r\nthe basis of cooperation, coexistence and common interests.\r\nThis outlook has been given concrete form in many\r\nareas such as emigration. In this regard, Tunisia is working\r\nto find appropriate formulas that would make the\r\nphenomenon of emigration a factor of convergence and\r\nmutual enrichment in terms of human values and culture,\r\nwhile making it an economic bridge between the South and\r\nthe North.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to say that the\r\nproclamation of 1995 as the United Nations Year for\r\nTolerance is of special significance to us. Our support for\r\nthe draft resolution on multilingualism within the United\r\nNations and our commitment to consolidating this principle\r\nis, in our view, a contribution we make towards the\r\nstrengthening of this noble tendency and towards combating\r\nparochialism and rejection of the other. Consequently, it is\r\nan effective contribution to the promotion of tolerance,\r\nopenness and fruitful constructive cooperation between\r\nindividuals and amongst communities and peoples.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nTunisia welcomes the inclusion of this agenda item\r\non multilingualism in the United Nations. Consideration\r\nof this topic at a time when the international community\r\nis preparing to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations has a double\r\nmeaning.\r\nTo affirm the multilingual calling of the United\r\nNations is, first of all, to pay tribute to the founding\r\nfathers of this great institution, who in their wisdom\r\nwanted this Organization, which emerged from a\r\ndestructive war caused by a lack of understanding and\r\nrejection of difference, to be a symbol and a\r\nmanifestation of respect for “the other” in all his\r\ndiversity.\r\nContrary to totalitarian ideologies, the principles of\r\nour Organization emphasize respect and call for\r\nsafeguarding differences at the level of individuals and of\r\nthe peoples that constitute the international community.\r\nDifferences are to be seen as mutual enrichment, for the\r\noriginality of peoples is a contribution, an input on all\r\nsides to universality itself. Far from seeking uniformity\r\nand the levelling of differences, the philosophy at the\r\nfoundation of the San Francisco Charter is a declaration\r\nof faith in the freedom of individuals and the right of\r\npeoples to diversity.\r\nToday’s discussion of multilingualism is also a very\r\nhappy coincidence. Recalling the importance of linguistic\r\ndiversity within the United Nations is one of the main\r\nelements of the overall thinking taking place in many\r\nforums to contribute to renewing the United Nations and\r\nto instilling new dynamism in it.\r\nAlthough this thinking on the future of the\r\nOrganization is far from complete, and to the contrary, is\r\nexpanding in scope thanks to the many efforts made in\r\nthat direction, Tunisia hopes that the question of\r\nmultilingualism will elicit due interest and will be an\r\nimportant element of any plan agreed upon to increase the\r\nefficiency and influence of our Organization.\r\nIt goes without saying that the reaffirmation by all\r\n— in the academic world and in the field — of the\r\ninternational community’s interest in recognizing and\r\nconsolidating linguistic diversity must, at the same time,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nbe accompanied by concrete actions and daily gestures to\r\nensure harmonious, mutually beneficial and mutually\r\nfruitful existence for all cultures.\r\nIn other words, Tunisia feels that the principle of\r\nrespect for the use of all official languages recognized by\r\nthe Charter must be reflected in reality in all United\r\nNations meetings. No matter how valid a reason might be,\r\nin our view it should not be a pretext for discriminatory\r\npractices that do not respect the will of Member States and\r\ntrample upon the principles of linguistic equality desired by\r\nthe founding fathers of the Organization.\r\nMr. Yoogalingam (Malaysia): The draft resolution\r\n(A/50/L.6) before us embodies a concept dear to all of us,\r\nnamely multilingualism. Overall, the draft resolution would\r\ncontribute to the promotion of multilingualism in the\r\nOrganization. Monolingualism in this Organization poses\r\nproblems for all of us.\r\nIn Malaysia, the national language is Bahasa Malaysia\r\nwhich is also the medium of instruction in our tertiary\r\ninstitutions. Yet the Malaysian language is not one of the\r\nUnited Nations languages. Despite the fact that Malaysia’s\r\nown national language is not one of the United Nations\r\nlanguages, we continue to participate in the work of the\r\nOrganization, through the use of one of the official United\r\nNations languages.\r\nMalaysia therefore welcomes the thrust of the draft\r\nresolution. However, paragraph 3 poses problems for us. By\r\nrequesting the Secretary-General to ensure that personnel\r\nrecruited by the various bodies of the Organization have a\r\ncommand of and use at least one of the six official\r\nlanguages in addition to one working language of the\r\nSecretariat it would only place at a disadvantage those\r\nwhose mother tongue is not one of the United Nations\r\nlanguages, for instance Malaysia. It would be grossly unfair\r\nand unhelpful for applicants to know more than one United\r\nNations language. This would discriminate against those of\r\nus who are already disadvantaged. It would prevent the\r\nnationals of these countries, who I daresay constitute a\r\nlarge number, from serving in the United Nations civil\r\nservice. In the quest to strike parity among the United\r\nNations languages, those already disadvantaged would be\r\nfurther discriminated against.\r\nMy delegation is aware of resolution 2480 B (XXIII)\r\nadopted on 21 December 1968. The language as reflected\r\nin the draft text before us departs from the spirit and the\r\nsubstance of the 1968 resolution.\r\nTaking that into account, my delegation would like\r\nto propose two options: the first being to delete paragraph\r\n3 and the other that it be amended to read as follows:\r\n“Requests the Secretary-General to take into\r\naccount the difficulties faced by applicants whose\r\nmother tongue is not one of the official languages\r\nwhen recruiting and promoting personnel for\r\ndifferent bodies of the Organization.”\r\nAs we have not had sufficient time to consider the\r\ndraft resolution, we would request the sponsors to\r\nexercise patience and understanding for those of us who\r\nhave serious problems with the text. In this regard, I wish\r\nto appeal for that the decision on the draft resolution to\r\nbe deferred. However, in the event that this appeal is not\r\nacceptable, we request that action be taken on the\r\namendment proposed by my delegation and that, if\r\nnecessary, we take a vote on the draft resolution on a\r\nparagraph-by-paragraph basis.\r\nThe President: I would request members to submit\r\namendments to the Secretariat in written form.\r\nMr. Albin (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its satisfaction that this\r\nagenda item is being considered at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization affords a particularly suitable setting in\r\nwhich to reflect upon and bring out certain aspects of our\r\nworking methods that at times seem to take on a lesser\r\nimportance. My delegation supports the statement made\r\nby the representative of Argentina on behalf of the\r\ncountries members of the Ibero-American Conference.\r\nMember States have agreed on the use of certain\r\nlanguages in conducting United Nations activities to carry\r\nout the Organization’s objectives. In keeping with\r\ndecisions set forth in the General Assembly’s rules of\r\nprocedure and resolutions, such languages are to be\r\nemployed on an equal footing. The official languages,\r\ntherefore, are an optimal and indispensable\r\ncommunications tool. Their use is the best guarantee of\r\ndialogue, negotiation and understanding among the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe note with concern that at the present time the\r\nOrganization’s ever-growing needs and activities have in\r\npractice been reflected in an inequitable use of United\r\nNations official and working languages. We firmly\r\nbelieve that this situation must be corrected within the\r\nframework of the existing rules.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 20 October 1995\r\nWe believe that the draft resolution before us contains\r\nthe minimum measures necessary to ensure the use, on an\r\nequal footing, of the official and working languages of the\r\nOrganization. We believe that this will contribute to\r\nstrengthening the multilingual character of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe support and endorse the initiative taken by the\r\nsponsors of this text, and we urge all Member States to do\r\nthe same. There can be no doubt that today, after 50 years\r\nof unremitting labour, these measures will greatly benefit\r\nthe Organization.\r\nMr. Fitschen (Germany): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of Austria and Liechtenstein as well as of my\r\nown country. Unlike many preceding speakers, I do not\r\nhave the privilege of expressing myself in my own\r\nlanguage, but I am, of course, happy to use one of the\r\nworking languages of the United Nations.\r\nGermany, Austria and Liechtenstein have joined the\r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/50/L.6 because we share the\r\nconcept of multilingualism in the United Nations and the\r\nconcerns behind the draft resolution now before the General\r\nAssembly for adoption.\r\nWe know about the usefulness of a timely and precise\r\ntranslation of United Nations documents from our own\r\nnational experience. Germany, Austria and Liechtenstein,\r\ntogether with Switzerland, have for some 20 years now\r\nfinanced the German Translation Service, which was\r\nestablished by the General Assembly in resolution\r\n3355 (XXIX) of 18 December 1974. Through the\r\ntranslation of the resolutions of the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council,\r\nas well as of other important United Nations documents,\r\nthe German Translation Service has over the years\r\ndeveloped a concise and reliable United Nations\r\nterminology in German, the availability of which has been\r\nof the utmost importance for the public debate about\r\nUnited Nations matters in our countries. Our people, as\r\nwell as our political institutions, take great interest in\r\nUnited Nations affairs, and the early availability of\r\nimportant United Nations documents in the German\r\nlanguage — such as, for example, the texts of the\r\nCopenhagen World Summit for Social Development or\r\nthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women, to name\r\nbut a few recent examples — greatly contributes to an\r\ninformed public debate on the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is against that background that we fully support\r\nthe ideas expressed in draft resolution A/50/L.6. We\r\nregret, however, that it has not been possible to have the\r\ndraft resolution acknowledge, in a preambular paragraph,\r\nthe Assembly’s decision to establish the German\r\nTranslation Service, which in our view was a perfect\r\nexpression of the idea of multilingualism in the United\r\nNations. We have nevertheless joined the sponsors\r\nbecause we deem it particularly important that the\r\nprovisions of the Charter and the rules of procedure\r\nconcerning the use of languages in the United Nations be\r\nfully implemented. Let me add that we understand the\r\nconcerns expressed earlier in the debate by Japan,\r\nSingapore and Malaysia. I am confident that they can be\r\naccommodated so that the draft resolution can be adopted\r\nby consensus.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\nowing to the arrangements that have to be made in the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall in preparation for the Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting, I must adjourn the meeting at\r\nthis point. Therefore, the remaining speakers on this\r\nagenda item will be heard next week, and the date will be\r\nannounced in the Journal.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n13\r\n"
