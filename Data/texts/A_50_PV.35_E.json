(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 29\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations\r\nThe President: I have the honour this morning to\r\nopen the Special Commemorative Meeting on the occasion\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, pursuant\r\nto General Assembly resolutions 48/215 B of 26 May 1994\r\nand 49/12 B of 24 May 1995.\r\nDistinguished Heads of State, Heads of Government\r\nand other High Dignitaries of State, Excellencies:\r\nIt is my privilege to thank each one of you for coming\r\nfrom all parts of the world to the Headquarters of the\r\nUnited Nations in order to participate in the Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting of its fiftieth anniversary and, by\r\ndoing so, to give public testimony of your praise for the\r\nachievements of the last 50 years and of your strong\r\ncommitment to preserve and reform this commendable\r\nOrganization.\r\nThis is your home, and the future of the United\r\nNations will be what you, Excellencies, decide it to be. The\r\ndestiny of the United Nations is in your hands.\r\nBut what is to be done? Is this an Organization\r\nworth preserving in view of its past? And what shall we\r\ndo with it in view of its future?\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nDuring the first 50 years of its history, the United\r\nNations has not been able to achieve all of its ideals but\r\nit has not been the sterile, ineffective, not-to-say harmful,\r\ninstrument which its detractors accuse it of being. We\r\nhumbly acknowledge the mistakes, omissions and faults,\r\nbut let us not forget the successes, the victories, the good\r\nthat has been done for the benefit of all mankind.\r\nShould we regret having founded a universal\r\nOrganization to attempt to maintain peace among nations\r\nand to affirm the primacy of law and justice? Do we\r\nconsider it a mistake to have adopted the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights to ensure that these rights\r\nare respected by all and to contribute to the\r\ndemocratization of an increasing number of countries?\r\nDo we deny the principle of self-determination of\r\npeoples, decolonization, the end of apartheid?\r\nDo we not recognize that development aid to the\r\npoorest countries on the planet is essential?\r\nDo we admit to being wrong when we set the most\r\nrecent priority to protect nature and the environment?\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nExcellencies, no. We have not been wrong — neither\r\nin 1945 nor during the last 50 years. Our principles, our\r\nvalues, our ideals were then and are now politically valid,\r\nmorally worthy and humanely just. We should be proud of\r\nthem.\r\nDoes this mean that everything is perfect at the United\r\nNations? Obviously not.\r\nBut let us not be misled by criticism. There is, of\r\ncourse, reason to rectify many things, but it would be a\r\nserious mistake for mankind to allow the United Nations to\r\ndie.\r\nIf the goals and purposes of the United Nations are\r\npositive and welcome, and if the Organization has been and\r\ncontinues to be able to realize them even though with\r\nlimitations and shortcomings, we should not be ashamed of\r\nour support to the United Nations. We must simply reform\r\nit.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nSupporting the United Nations — that should be our\r\ncollective pledge in this Special Commemorative Meeting.\r\nReforming the United Nations — that should be our\r\npolitical commitment during these three days.\r\nWe must not allow this Organization to die at the\r\nhands of its critics, nor to perish for lack of commitment of\r\nits supporters. Therefore I ask you: Please tell the world\r\nthat freedom, justice, development and human solidarity are\r\nmagnificent values worth living and working for. Please tell\r\nyour peoples that we must all help each other for the\r\nsurvival and benefit of humanity. Please tell your\r\nGovernments and Parliaments that, with the necessary\r\nreforms and changes, the United Nations needs money to\r\nfunction, support from Member countries to function well,\r\nand wisdom and generosity from us all to save and help\r\nthose human beings most in need.\r\nExcellencies, at the very beginning of these unique\r\nand historic meetings, may I share with you these three\r\nwishes:\r\nLet us praise the United Nations and its \"founding\r\nfathers\".\r\nLet us fight the destructive critics of the Organization\r\nand not allow them to be the United Nations \"liquidating\r\nfathers\".\r\nLet us take upon ourselves the noble and necessary\r\ntask of becoming, from today, the \"reforming fathers\" of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIf we do so, we will deserve the respect of future\r\ngenerations, especially when they celebrate — surely in\r\nthis same Hall — the hundredth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI now call upon the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General (interpretation from\r\nArabic): May I welcome you all, Kings, heads of State\r\nand Government of the world. Welcome to your home,\r\nthe home of the world’s peoples. Welcome to the forum\r\nof the United Nations, the forum of peace, concord and\r\ndevelopment. Welcome to you all, and heartfelt greetings\r\nfor your leadership.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe meet to commemorate 50 years of the United\r\nNations. How can we shape the next 50 years to serve\r\npeople’s needs? The world of the twenty-first century will\r\nconfront two great opposing forces: globalization and\r\nfragmentation. A new dialectic has already begun.\r\nGlobalization will generate a number of problems.\r\nFinancial flows of vast magnitude sweep across the\r\nworld. Alarming environmental events will expose the\r\nplanet to permanent damage. Transnational crime will\r\ngrow. The global communications revolution will generate\r\npressures which our national institutions were not\r\ndesigned to address.\r\nFragmentation also will characterize the future. The\r\nremote and impersonal forces of globalization will cause\r\npeople to seek security in smaller groups. Fragmentation\r\ncan breed fanaticism, isolationism, separatism and the\r\nproliferation of civil war.\r\nThe United Nations can help deal with the dialectic\r\nof globalization and fragmentation and help solve the\r\nproblems it will create. It can do so because the United\r\nNations was designed to be both the world Organization\r\nand the Organization of its Member States — designed,\r\ntherefore, to respond both to global concerns and to the\r\nneeds of Member States and their peoples. As if in\r\ntraining for precisely this moment, the United Nations in\r\n50 years has gained experience in dealing with both\r\nglobalization and fragmentation.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nIn response to globalization, the United Nations\r\ndefined human rights for the global community. It fostered\r\nthe progress of international law. It transformed the law of\r\nthe sea. Through a continuum of global conferences it is\r\npromoting international consensus on new global issues of\r\ndisarmament, environment, population, social development\r\nand migration.\r\nIn response to fragmentation, the United Nations has\r\nbeen called upon to respond to civil wars: Katanga,\r\nCambodia, El Salvador, Angola and Mozambique. To\r\nprevent fragmentation, the United Nations is promoting\r\ndemocratization both within and among States. Within\r\nStates, issues of identity and ethnic separatism will be\r\ndecided by the ballot box, not by the gun. Among States,\r\ndemocratization will promote the full participation of all\r\nStates in world affairs.\r\nBut the United Nations cannot play this role if the\r\npresent trend continues. The United Nations is trapped by\r\na second dialectic. The problems of globalization and\r\nfragmentation have caused vast responsibilities to be given\r\nto the United Nations, but the United Nations has not been\r\ngiven the resources required to accomplish the tasks\r\nimposed.\r\nThe financial crisis is a symptom of a deeper problem:\r\nMember States simply do not regard the United Nations as\r\na priority. This is sad news to report to this Meeting. I\r\nappeal to you to give the United Nations a firm financial\r\nbase. If steps towards this cannot be set in motion by the\r\nend of this year, I urge you to give serious consideration to\r\ncalling a special session of the General Assembly to deal\r\nwith the financial crisis of the Organization.\r\nThis historic Meeting is a time for you, the leaders of\r\nthe world, to consider what you want from the United\r\nNations. I respectfully ask you to do this.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nstatement.\r\nBefore I call upon the first speaker this morning, may\r\nI again remind all delegations of the five-minute time limit.\r\nI hope that if there are exceptions they will be as limited as\r\npossible.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. William J. Clinton,\r\nPresident of the United States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. William Clinton, President\r\nof the United States of America.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. William J. Clinton, President of\r\nthe United States of America, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Clinton: This week the United Nations is\r\n50 years old. The dreams of its founders have not been\r\nfully realized. But its promise endures.\r\nThe value of the United Nations can be seen the\r\nworld over: in the nourished bodies of once-starving\r\nchildren; in the full lives of those immunized against\r\ndisease; in the eyes of students eager to learn; in the\r\nenvironment sustained; in the refugees saved; in the peace\r\nkept; and, most recently, in standing up for the human\r\nrights and human possibilities of women and their\r\nchildren, at the Beijing Conference.\r\nThe United Nations is the product of faith and\r\nknowledge: faith that different peoples can work together\r\nfor tolerance, decency and peace; knowledge that this\r\nfaith will be forever tested by the forces of intolerance,\r\ndepravity and aggression. Now we must summon that\r\nfaith — and act on that knowledge — to meet the\r\nchallenges of a new era.\r\nIn the United States, some people ask: Why should\r\nwe bother with the United Nations? America is strong.\r\nWe can go it alone. Well we will act if we have to, alone.\r\nBut my fellow Americans should not forget that our\r\nvalues and our interests are also served by working with\r\nthe United Nations. The United Nations helps the\r\npeacemakers, the care-providers, the defenders of freedom\r\nand human rights, the architects of economic prosperity\r\nand the protectors of our planet to spread the risk, share\r\nthe burden and increase the impact of our common\r\nefforts.\r\nLast year I pledged that the United States would\r\ncontinue to contribute substantially to the finances of the\r\nUnited Nations. Historically the United States has been —\r\nand today it remains — the largest contributor to the\r\nUnited Nations. But I am determined that we must fully\r\nmeet our obligations and I am working with our Congress\r\non a plan to do so. All who contribute to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and care about its future must also be\r\ncommitted to reform, to ending bureaucratic inefficiencies\r\nand outdated priorities. The United Nations must be able\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nto show that the money it receives supports saving and\r\nenriching peoples’ lives — not unneeded overhead.\r\nReform requires breaking up bureaucratic fiefdoms;\r\neliminating obsolete agencies; and doing more with less.\r\nThe United Nations must reform to remain relevant, and to\r\nplay a still stronger role in the march of freedom, peace and\r\nprosperity. We see it around the world. In the Middle East\r\nand Northern Ireland, people are turning from a violent past\r\nto a future of peace. In South Africa and Haiti, long nights\r\nof fear have given way to new days of freedom.\r\nThroughout this hemisphere every nation — except one —\r\nhas chosen democracy. And the goal of an integrated,\r\npeaceful and democratic Europe is now within our reach for\r\nthe first time.\r\nIn the Balkans, the international community’s\r\ndetermination and the resolve of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) have made prospects for peace\r\nbrighter than they have been for four long years. Let me\r\nsalute the efforts of the United Nations on behalf of the\r\npeople of Bosnia. The nations that took part in the United\r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) kept the toll of this\r\nterrible war — in lives lost; wounds left unhealed; children\r\nleft unfed — from being far graver still. Next week, the\r\nparties to the war in Bosnia will meet in Dayton, Ohio,\r\nunder the auspices of the United States and our Contact\r\nGroup partners — Russia, the United Kingdom, France and\r\nGermany — to intensify the search for peace. Many\r\nfundamental differences remain. But I urge the parties to\r\nseize this chance for a settlement. If they achieve peace the\r\nUnited States will be there with our friends and allies to\r\nhelp secure it.\r\nAll over the world people yearn to live in peace and\r\nthat dream is becoming a reality.\r\nBut our time is not free of peril. As the cold war gives\r\nway to the global village, too many people remain\r\nvulnerable to poverty, disease and underdevelopment. All\r\nof us are exposed to ethnic and religious hatred, the\r\nreckless aggression of rogue States, terrorism, organized\r\ncrime, drug trafficking, and the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nThe emergence of the information-and-technology age\r\nhas brought us all closer together and given us\r\nextraordinary opportunities to build a better future. But in\r\nour global village progress can spread quickly, but trouble\r\ncan too. Trouble at the far end of town soon becomes a\r\nplague on everyone’s house. We cannot free our own\r\nneighbourhoods from drug-related crime without the help of\r\ncountries where the drugs are produced. We cannot track\r\ndown terrorists without assistance from other\r\nGovernments. We cannot prosper or preserve our\r\nenvironment unless sustainable development is a reality\r\nfor all nations. And our vigilance alone cannot keep\r\nnuclear weapons stored half a world away from falling\r\ninto the wrong hands.\r\nNowhere is cooperation more vital than in fighting\r\nthe increasingly interconnected groups that traffic in\r\nterror, organized crime, drug smuggling and the spread of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. No one is immune: not the\r\npeople of Japan, where terrorists unleashed nerve gas in\r\nthe subway and poisoned thousands; not the people of\r\nLatin America or South-East Asia, where drug traffickers\r\nwielding imported weapons have murdered judges,\r\njournalists, police officers and innocent passers-by; not\r\nthe people of Israel and France, where hatemongers have\r\nblown up buses and trains full of children with suitcase\r\nbombs made from smuggled explosives; not the people of\r\nthe former Soviet Union and Central Europe, where\r\norganized criminals seek to weaken new democracies and\r\nprey on decent, hard-working men and women; and not\r\nthe people of the United States, where home-grown\r\nterrorists blew up a federal building in the heart of\r\nAmerica, and where foreign terrorists tried to topple the\r\nWorld Trade Center and plotted to destroy the very Hall\r\nwe gather in today.\r\nThese forces jeopardize the global trend towards\r\npeace and freedom, undermine fragile new democracies,\r\nsap the strength from developing countries and threaten\r\nour efforts to build a safer, more prosperous world. So\r\ntoday I call upon all nations to join us in the fight against\r\nthem. Our common efforts can produce results. To reduce\r\nthe threat of weapons of mass destruction, we are\r\nworking with Russia to reduce our nuclear arsenals by\r\ntwo thirds. We supported Ukraine, Kazakhstan and\r\nBelarus in removing nuclear weapons from their soil. We\r\nwork with the states of the former Soviet Union to\r\nsafeguard nuclear materials and to convert them to\r\npeaceful use. North Korea has agreed to freeze its nuclear\r\nprogramme under international monitoring. Many of the\r\nnations in this Hall succeeded in getting the indefinite\r\nextension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nTo stem the flow of narcotics and stop the spread of\r\norganized crime, we are cooperating with many nations,\r\nsharing information, providing military support and\r\ninitiating anti-corruption efforts. Results are coming. With\r\nColombian authorities we have cracked down on the\r\ncartels that control the world’s cocaine market. Two years\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nago they lived as billionaires beyond the law; now many\r\nare living as prisoners behind bars.\r\nTo take on terrorists we maintain strong sanctions\r\nagainst States that sponsor terrorism and defy the rule of\r\nlaw, States such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan. We ask\r\nthem today again to turn from that path. Meanwhile we\r\nincrease our own law enforcement efforts and our\r\ncooperation with other nations.\r\nNothing we do will make us invulnerable. But we can\r\nall become less vulnerable if we work together. That is why\r\ntoday I am announcing new initiatives to fight international\r\norganized crime, drug trafficking, terrorism and the spread\r\nof weapons of mass destruction — initiatives we can take\r\non our own and others we hope we will take together — in\r\nthe form of an international declaration to promote the\r\nsafety of the world’s citizens.\r\nFirst, the steps we will take: Yesterday I directed our\r\nGovernment to identify and put on notice nations that\r\ntolerate money-laundering. Criminal enterprises are moving\r\nvast sums of ill-gotten gains through the international\r\nfinancial system with absolute impunity. We must not allow\r\nthem to wash the blood off profits from the sale of drugs,\r\nfrom terror or organized crime. Nations should bring their\r\nbanks and financial systems into conformity with\r\ninternational anti-money-laundering standards. We will\r\nwork to help them do so. If they refuse we will consider\r\nappropriate sanctions. Next I directed our Government to\r\nidentity the front companies and to freeze the assets of the\r\nlargest drug ring in the world, the Cali Cartel, to cut off its\r\neconomic lifelines and stop our own people from dealing\r\nunknowingly with its companies. Finally, I have instructed\r\nthe Justice Department to prepare legislation to provide our\r\nother agencies with the tools they need to respond to\r\norganized criminal activity.\r\nBut because we must win this battle together, I now\r\ninvite every country to join in negotiating and endorsing a\r\ndeclaration on international crime and citizen safety.\r\nThat declaration should include, first, a no-sanctuary\r\npledge so that we could say together to organized criminals,\r\nterrorists, drug traffickers and smugglers, “You have\r\nnowhere to run and nowhere to hide”.\r\nIt should include, secondly, a counter-terrorism pact so\r\nthat together we would urge more States to ratify existing\r\nanti-terrorism treaties and work with us to shut down the\r\ngrey markets that outfit terrorists and criminals with\r\nfirearms and false documents.\r\nThirdly, there should be an anti-narcotics offensive.\r\nThe international drug trade poisons people, breeds\r\nviolence and tears at the moral fabric of our societies. We\r\nmust intensify action against the drug cartels and the\r\ndestruction of drug crops, and we in consumer nations\r\nsuch as the United States must decrease demand for\r\ndrugs.\r\nFourthly, we should have an effective police-force\r\npartnership. International criminal organizations target\r\nnations whose law-enforcement agencies lack the\r\nexperience and capacity to stop them. To help police in\r\nthe new democracies of Central Europe, Hungary and the\r\nUnited States established an International Law\r\nEnforcement Academy in Budapest. Now we should\r\nconsider a network of centres around the world to share\r\nthe latest crime-fighting techniques and technology.\r\nFifthly, we need an illegal-arms and deadly-materials\r\ncontrol effort that we all participate in. A package the\r\nsize of a child’s lunch bag held the poison gas used to\r\nterrorize Tokyo. A lump of plutonium no bigger than a\r\nsoda can is enough to make an atomic bomb.\r\nBuilding on efforts already under way with the\r\nStates of the former Soviet Union and with our G-7\r\npartners, we will seek to better account for, store and\r\nsafeguard materials with massive destructive power. We\r\nshould strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention,\r\nadopt a comprehensive test-ban treaty next year and\r\nultimately eliminate the deadly scourge of land-mines. We\r\nmust press other countries, and our own Congress, to\r\nratify the Chemical Weapons Convention and to intensify\r\nour efforts to combat the global illegal arms network that\r\nfuels terrorism, equips drug cartels and prolongs deadly\r\nconflicts.\r\nThis is a full and challenging agenda, but we must\r\ncomplete it, and we must do so together.\r\nFifty years ago, as the conference that gave birth to\r\nthe United Nations got under way in San Francisco, a\r\nyoung American war hero recorded his impressions of\r\nthat event for a newspaper:\r\n“The average G.I. in the street doesn’t seem to have\r\na very clear-cut conception of what this meeting is\r\nabout”,\r\nwrote the young John F. Kennedy.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\n“But one bemedalled marine sergeant gave the general\r\nreaction when he said: I don’t know much about\r\nwhat’s going on, but if they just fix it so that we don’t\r\nhave to fight any more, they can count me in.\u0027”\r\nThe United Nations has not ended war, but it has\r\nmade it less likely and helped many nations turn from war\r\nto peace. The United Nations has not stopped human\r\nsuffering, but it has healed the wounds and lengthened the\r\nlives of millions of human beings. The United Nations has\r\nnot banished repression or poverty from the Earth, but it\r\nhas advanced the cause of freedom and prosperity on every\r\ncontinent. The United Nations has not been all that we\r\nwished it would be, but it has been a force for good and a\r\nbulwark against evil. So at the dawn of a new century so\r\nfull of promise yet plagued by peril, we still need the\r\nUnited Nations. And so, for another 50 years and beyond,\r\nyou can count the United States in.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the United\r\nStates of America for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. William J. Clinton, President of\r\nthe United States of America, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Leonid D. Kuchma,\r\nPresident of Ukraine\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Leonid D. Kuchma,\r\nPresident of Ukraine.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Leonid D. Kuchma, President of\r\nUkraine, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Kuchma (interpretation from Ukrainian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Speaking from\r\nthis loftiest rostrum on the planet, I feel pride, gratitude and\r\nhope. My pride is for the wisdom and far-sightedness of the\r\nfounders of the United Nations, who actually laid the\r\nfoundation of a new world order. Challenging history itself,\r\nthey attempted to establish peaceableness and mutual\r\nassistance as forces to oppose hostility and intolerance, and\r\nfor the first time this was done successfully. Thus, the\r\npeoples of the Earth received a unique instrument for\r\nconsolidating mankind as a single universal organism in its\r\nefforts to survive and build a better world.\r\nI am doubly proud of all that because representatives\r\nof my people were among the founders of the United\r\nNations. The United Nations might have been the only\r\nuniversal forum in which Ukraine could proclaim its\r\nexistence as a country. The support of the United Nations\r\npromoted the realization of our age-old aspiration to have\r\na State of our own.\r\nFinally, I place great hopes in the future of the\r\nUnited Nations, which brings us closer to the moment\r\nwhen we shall be able to say, “The United Nations means\r\na united world.”\r\nWith the era of great ideological confrontation\r\nbehind us, mankind has managed to decrease the threat of\r\nself-destruction by nuclear conflagration and to establish\r\nsufficiently reliable mechanisms of international security.\r\nI am pleased to point out that Ukraine has made a\r\nspecial contribution to the cause of disarmament. Ours,\r\nthe third largest nuclear State, was the first in the world\r\nvoluntarily to renounce nuclear status and nuclear\r\nweapons. However, this has entailed enormous economic\r\nand ecological losses for us.\r\nI am certain that the establishment of a special\r\nstatus, with international security guarantees, consolidated\r\nfinancial and technical assistance and moral incentives,\r\nfor countries that renounce nuclear weapons would\r\nprovide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process\r\nof nuclear disarmament. This could be implemented\r\nthrough a new United Nations programme for a twenty-\r\nfirst-century world without nuclear weapons.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping activities require\r\nconstant improvement and increased efficiency. First and\r\nforemost, this would entail reorientation of conflicts\r\ntowards preventive diplomacy. This would also be\r\npromoted by establishing United Nations trusteeship over\r\nnew States in the process of formation, in order to make\r\nthe use of force inadmissible and ensure adherence to\r\nestablished norms of international law.\r\nAt the same time, the international community\r\nshould adapt its attitude to separatism — which is\r\nfrequently the initial cause of local conflicts and which\r\ncould become the severest challenge to the world of the\r\ntwenty-first century — to present-day realities.\r\nThe disappearance of a world divided into\r\nantagonistic systems is related to profound internal\r\ntransformations in post-socialist countries. I am convinced\r\nof the need to establish the most favourable regime\r\npossible for those countries’ integration into the\r\ninternational community. The establishment of a new\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nUnited Nations council for economic security — on a level\r\nwith the Security Council, equal to it in weight and\r\ninfluence — would promote the drafting of specific\r\nproposals for international support for those countries’\r\ndevelopment. Such a body could be used to identify\r\nstrategic prospects for mankind’s development and for\r\npreventive efforts in the decades ahead.\r\nThe United Nations was established by people who\r\nrealized that nations, peoples and States are interdependent\r\nand complementary components of a single entity called\r\nhumanity. The presence of an unprecedented number of\r\nworld leaders here today is convincing evidence of their\r\nsupport for the United Nations at this crucial stage of its\r\ndevelopment. The most important task for the United\r\nNations today is to define itself under these new conditions\r\nand to follow the road indicated by the real circumstances\r\nof our existence. To do this would constitute a source of\r\nstrength, longevity and moral health for the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of Ukraine for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Leonid D. Kuchma, President of\r\nUkraine, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal, King\r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal, King of\r\nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nHis Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal, King of the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nHis Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): It is with pleasure that I greet you all, and\r\nexpress my great pride to be among you today, to represent\r\nmy country, Jordan, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the creation of the United Nations Organization. As I\r\nextend my sincere congratulations to you, I recall with\r\nesteem and reverence the founders who worked with\r\ndiligence and sincerity to ingrain the principles of\r\ninternational legality to enhance the role of this\r\nOrganization, and to safeguard its noble message.\r\nI may not be the eldest head of State among you, but\r\nGod has willed that I should be the longest serving, and the\r\none who has dealt with the United Nations for the longest\r\nperiod. This has allowed me to follow its development over\r\ndecades. I recall at an early age, witnessing the\r\nendeavours of men like Trygve Lie, Count Bernadotte,\r\nRalph Bunche, Ambassador Pierre Spinelli, the\r\noutstanding man, Dag Hammerskjold, as well as Gunnar\r\nJarring and many others who have served the cause of\r\npeace and stability in our region.\r\nAs we acknowledge our debt to the men and women\r\nof the United Nations who have worked over the years to\r\npreserve peace in our region, we Jordanians feel proud to\r\nhave contributed to serve the same lofty ideals in other\r\nparts of the world. The number of Jordanians who\r\nparticipated in United Nations peace-keeping missions\r\nover the past years has reached almost 15,000 servicemen.\r\nJordan, in point of fact, ranked fifth among the countries\r\nof the world in terms of troop contributions to those noble\r\nmissions.\r\nMy country has suffered enormously from successive\r\nwars in the Middle East region which resulted in the\r\ntragedy of the Palestinian people. We absorbed the human\r\nconsequences of their plight in an honourable,\r\nunparalleled way in the region. Jordan became the\r\nsanctuary and the homeland of all, regardless of their\r\norigins. When the cold war ended and we had the\r\nopportunity to end the Middle East conflict, we were fully\r\naware that the comprehensive peace which we sought\r\ncalled for wisdom and courage on the part of all leaders.\r\nIt required confidence in the rule of international legality\r\nto settle the differences amongst peoples. We have taken\r\nthis path with confidence, and we have achieved a great\r\ndeal.\r\nToday we celebrate the first anniversary of the\r\nJordanian-Israeli peace treaty, which we hope will be a\r\nprincipal underpinning of the process of comprehensive,\r\njust and lasting peace in the region; that peace which will\r\nenable all the region’s peoples to resume their quest for\r\ndevelopment and to build a better life for future\r\ngenerations.\r\nOver the past year, we have been able to address\r\ncomprehensively all the terms of the treaty governing\r\nfuture relations between Jordan and Israel. I am glad to\r\nannounce from this platform that young pilots from the\r\nRoyal Jordanian Air Force and the Israeli Air Force flew\r\nthe skies of their two countries today in joint formations\r\nto honour their comrades who have fallen, to salute their\r\npeoples and to embody peace and the commitment to\r\nsafeguard it.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nPeace, poverty, and underdevelopment cannot co-exist\r\nin the same region. Hence, the Amman economic summit,\r\nwhich, in a few days, will herald a new drive for the\r\ncomprehensive development of the region and underscore\r\nthe concept of cooperation amongst the peoples of the\r\nregion with a view to improving their standards of living,\r\nand in consolidating peace and regional cooperation\r\namongst them.\r\nPermit me, on this occasion, to thank this Organization\r\nfor announcing last Friday the establishment of the United\r\nNations University International Leadership Academy in\r\nJordan. This academy will be the first of its kind for the\r\npromising leaderships in the world and the first branch of\r\nthe United Nations University in the Middle East.\r\nFifty years have passed since the United Nations was\r\nfounded. During this time, some of its Member States have\r\nundergone fundamental changes. This is a good moment to\r\nreview the structure and systems of the international\r\norganizations and institutions. Of prime importance is a\r\nreview of the Security Council and the nature of\r\nmembership in it so that the Organization may reflect\r\ntoday’s world. This is essential for the United Nations to\r\nrejuvenate itself and meet its new challenges.\r\nMany regions of the world today continue to suffer\r\nfrom tensions and conflicts. Others dwell in the shadow of\r\nwar and the resultant poverty, backwardness and abuses of\r\nhuman rights. It is high time that the international\r\ncommunity moved to alleviate their suffering and help them\r\nto overcome their difficulties and their plight. In this\r\nrespect, Jordan will continue to strive, propelled by its faith\r\nand convictions, to be a living example of harmonious\r\npluralism in democracy, freedom and respect for human\r\nrights. Once again, I greet you all and I wish this\r\nOrganization every success and progress. God bless you all.\r\nThe President: I thank the King of the Hashemite\r\nKingdom of Jordan for his statement.\r\nHis Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal, King of the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by Her Excellency The Honourable Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of the Democratic\r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nHer Excellency The Honourable Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nP r e s i d e n t C h a n d r i k a B a n d a r a n a i k e\r\nKumaratunga: Your Excellency, permit me to express\r\nmy good wishes on your election as President. I am\r\ndeeply honoured to represent the people of Sri Lanka on\r\nthis historic occasion.\r\nSri Lanka has always reposed great hopes in the\r\nUnited Nations for effective collective action to achieve\r\nour central aim of socio-economic development and\r\nthereby ensure social stability and peace for our people.\r\nThe transition from the cold-war era to a new world\r\norder has shifted the arena of conflict from the\r\ninternational to the national. Whatever the overlay of such\r\nconflicts, whether they take on religious, racial or other\r\nforms, they stem from poverty and social inequality. We\r\nbelieve, therefore, that the foundations of peace must be\r\nbuilt on economic and social stability.\r\nThe new agenda of the United Nations, with its\r\nheavy emphasis on peace-keeping operations, has\r\nimpacted adversely on the development process.\r\nAs a developing country, Sri Lanka attaches great\r\nimportance to the role that the United Nations can and\r\nmust perform in advancing the development process.\r\nUnless the principles of the Declaration on the Right to\r\nDevelopment, adopted in 1986, are applied positively,\r\nwith the full commitment of both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, the development process will not be\r\nsufficiently advanced.\r\nWe believe that effective strengthening of the United\r\nNations system is an essential requisite for advancing its\r\ngoals. The Organization has, regrettably, sometimes come\r\nto be seen by the more vulnerable States as primarily\r\nserving the interests of the more powerful States. We\r\nwelcome the timely initiative of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at last year’s session to strengthen and\r\nempower the United Nations system.\r\nEffective empowerment, in our view, requires: first,\r\nthat development priorities should not be sacrificed in the\r\npursuit of politico-military operations, which must be set\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nat realistic — even modest — levels; secondly, that\r\ndecision-making by the United Nations in all areas must be\r\nbased on the full engagement of all Members, and the\r\nSecurity Council in particular must become more\r\nrepresentative of and more responsive to the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations; thirdly, that\r\ncommitments made for multilateral action in all fields must\r\nbe honoured and diligently pursued. In short, the\r\nrevitalizing process must enhance the capacity of the United\r\nNations, rather than merely effect economies and scale\r\ndown its scope.\r\nIn the index of human development Sri Lanka rates\r\nhigh among developing countries, but we have been\r\ntraumatized by ethnic tensions kept unnaturally high by the\r\nforces of terrorism and chauvinism. Nonetheless, my\r\nGovernment is resolved to fulfil its mandate by seeking,\r\nthrough political negotiations, solutions to our problems that\r\nwould enable our people to live in peace, security and\r\nfreedom.\r\nThere are, however, obstacles in our way. An armed\r\ngroup which claims to represent an ethnic minority has\r\nbeen engaged in violent acts against successive popularly\r\nelected Governments, preventing them from ensuring peace\r\nand justice for all in our land. This group, which also\r\noperates on foreign soil, maintains an international network\r\nfor fund-raising based on coercion and blackmail. That\r\nnetwork has a close nexus with powerful commercial\r\ninterests engaged in narcotic trafficking, trade in illicit arms\r\nand smuggling of illegal immigrants. Concerted\r\ninternational action is essential to combat terrorism and to\r\ncompel the terrorists to renounce violence and enter the\r\ndemocratic process. Unfortunately, effective action to that\r\nend has been frustrated through sterile philosophical debate\r\nabout the nature of terrorism.\r\nHowever, in the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC) we have overcome that difficulty by\r\nfocusing our attention on manifestations of terrorism. The\r\nSAARC Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism\r\nprovides for a collective response. This centres on a\r\ncomprehensive legal regime and practical measures to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nI urge similar action by the United Nations to give\r\nlegal effect to the obligations arising from the Declaration\r\non the Elimination of Terrorism, adopted last year. I was\r\nhappy to hear President Clinton’s statement in this regard.\r\nI hope that our common realization of the terrible\r\nconsequences of terrorism, drug trafficking and other such\r\nantisocial activities will usher in a new era of\r\ninternational cooperation to combat these problems.\r\nMy Government is committed to providing full\r\nopportunities in Sri Lanka for the development of the\r\ntotal human person. While promoting rapid economic\r\ngrowth, we seek to distribute its benefits equitably. This\r\ninvolves the maintenance of democratic institutions and\r\nthe preservation of human rights. It makes of politics the\r\ndischarge of a public trust, where decision-making is\r\ntransparent and free of corruption and everyone in public\r\nlife is accountable for their actions.\r\nIn the end, the United Nations will essentially be\r\nwhat we the Member States make of it — not what\r\nindividual States seek to make from it.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Sri\r\nLanka, I take this opportunity to wish the United Nations\r\nsuccess in its endeavours to transform the separate dreams\r\nof all the nations into a multifaceted, yet harmonious,\r\nreality.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for her\r\nstatement.\r\nHer Excellency The Honourable Chandrika\r\nBandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Sam Nujoma,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of\r\nthe Republic of Namibia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Nujoma: We are gathered here on this\r\nhistoric occasion to praise the United Nations for its\r\noutstanding achievements and, at the same time, to pay a\r\nwell-deserved tribute to its founders.\r\nCelebration of the birth, longevity and performance\r\nof the United Nations is proper and fitting indeed. The\r\nworld has been a safer place because of the United\r\nNations, and its continued relevance is beyond question.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nYet our thoughts focus beyond the celebration, on the\r\nfuture.\r\nDuring the past 50 years, this Organization has served\r\nhumanity as a universal market-place of great ideas and\r\ncollective action. From its founding, the United Nations has\r\nhad its critics — among them, some prophets of doom. But\r\nthe truth is that after 50 years the Organization is alive and\r\nwell. Its misfortunes are exaggerated. Failures are those of\r\nthe Member States, and not of the United Nations.\r\nThe 50 years of the existence of the United Nations\r\nhave brought the peoples of the world closer together than\r\never before. Indeed, today’s world is truly a global village.\r\nDuring this period we have also witnessed tremendous\r\nbreakthroughs in the fields of science and technology and\r\ninformation, as well as in respect for the worth of the\r\nhuman person and in consciousness of the environment.\r\nWe are now more than ever aware that this is our one\r\nworld, belonging to all of us, rich and poor, developed and\r\ndeveloping, big and small. Let us, therefore, together\r\ncommit ourselves to keeping our planet, oceans and space\r\nsafe and to developing the common heritage of humankind\r\nwhich they offer on a sustainable basis for all.\r\nWe in Namibia waged one of the last major battles in\r\nAfrica against colonial tyranny and brutality.\r\nDecolonization is the most monumental accomplishment of\r\nthe United Nations and humankind. Namibia stands out as\r\na brilliant example of the decisive role played by the United\r\nNations in this field.\r\nThe United Nations, it can be said, has used the\r\nNamibian experience to develop international norms of\r\npeace-keeping and modalities for political transformation.\r\nLet me, however, point out that the key to this success was\r\nthe readiness of the Namibians themselves to cooperate\r\nwith the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. This\r\nis a success story our Organization should be proud of.\r\nIn Namibia, we have fully incorporated democratic\r\nideals, fundamental human rights, basic freedoms and the\r\nprotection of the environment into our Constitution. We are\r\nnow striving to imprint the ideals of the Constitution on the\r\nminds and hearts of our people. Happily, today, the rights\r\nof women, children, migrant workers and indeed all human\r\nbeings are respected and defended worldwide in the\r\nconstitutions and laws of many nations.\r\nAs we start the second jubilee of the United Nations,\r\nwe must abandon past misconceptions as well as the way\r\nwe conduct inter-State relations. Cold-war legacies must\r\nbe replaced by cooperation in the emerging world order.\r\nA restructuring of the Security Council, which is long\r\noverdue, should be carried out in a manner that upholds\r\nthe principles of democracy, the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, equitable geographical representation and\r\ntransparency. Only then can the legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness of the Council be enhanced. There is no\r\nshortage of workable ideas to bring about the necessary\r\nreform that will accommodate the vital interests of Africa,\r\nAsia and Latin America as permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. Needless to say, the\r\nauthority and importance of the General Assembly should\r\nnot be compromised in the reform exercise.\r\nGranted, the United Nations is far from perfect, but\r\nfor us, it is the only truly viable forum in which\r\ndeveloping and small nations like Namibia can raise their\r\nvoices on the basis of equality. This Assembly stands at\r\nthe centre of multilateral diplomacy and cooperation as\r\noriginally envisioned by the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Rededication, therefore, must start here.\r\nDuring the next 50 years and beyond, the United\r\nNations should stress interdependence, equity and fair\r\nplay among nations and peoples in order to remove the\r\never-widening gap between the rich North and the poor\r\nSouth. The future belongs to the youth and children. Our\r\ncollective duty must be to reinforce their vision for a\r\npeaceful, harmonious and prosperous future in the spirit\r\nof brotherhood and cooperation.\r\nThe President: I wish to thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Frederick J. T.\r\nChiluba, President of the Republic of Zambia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Frederick J. T. Chiluba,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Frederick J. T. Chiluba,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Chiluba: Let me happily congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, and pay tribute to you on your deserved election\r\nto the high office of President of the General Assembly\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nat its fiftieth session. We are sure of the successful\r\nproceedings of the session under your able leadership.\r\nI wish to reaffirm Zambia’s abiding faith in the United\r\nNations. I further wish to reiterate my country and\r\nGovernment’s commitment to the articles of faith of the\r\nUnited Nations, to which we fully subscribe.\r\nIn a world of growing tensions and challenges, the\r\nUnited Nations has performed well since its inception in\r\n1945 and deserves a word of appreciation and thanks. Some\r\nof its officers and personnel have made supreme sacrifices\r\nin the execution of their selfless tasks. Among them was\r\nthe second Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Dag\r\nHammarskjöld, who died in a plane crash on 17 September\r\n1961 on Zambia’s soil. We must always remember all of\r\nthem for their valour.\r\nZambia is fully convinced that the United Nations can\r\nand must do even better. Its efficiency must be augmented\r\nand fortified. Zambia therefore joins those countries which\r\nhave called for a restructuring of the United Nations to\r\nenable it to cope with increased demands and challenges.\r\nThe United Nations today faces a crisis of confidence\r\nand expectations. The structures of 1945, designed and\r\nmeant to service an almost homogeneous membership of 50\r\ncountries that has since increased almost fourfold, are no\r\nlonger capable of serving and servicing the bigger and\r\nwider globe. Membership has increased in numbers as well\r\nas in regional diversity, which calls for equitable, broader\r\nrepresentation. In the spirit of genuine representative\r\ndemocracy and good governance which the United Nations\r\nembodies and personifies, in the spirit of the equality of\r\nnations and in the search for genuine peace and security,\r\nthe United Nations has to reform to embrace broader\r\ngeographical representation.\r\nThe Security Council especially, we believe, can no\r\nlonger be maintained as a sanctuary of the holy of holies,\r\nwith only the original members acting as high priests and\r\ndeciding on issues for the rest of the world, which cannot\r\nbe admitted. Broader and geographical representation is the\r\nanswer.\r\nWe believe that a restructured and more representative\r\nUnited Nations will be better equipped to respond to\r\ngrowing demands and challenges which have become\r\nmultifarious in character.\r\nZambia also believes that efficiency may be a far cry\r\nuntil and unless all Member States honour their obligations\r\nand pay their financial subscriptions to the world body to\r\nenable it to meet increased demands and challenges.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Zambia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Frederick J. T. Chiluba,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Süleyman Demirel,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Turkey\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Süleyman Demirel,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Turkey.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Süleyman Demirel, President of\r\nthe Republic of Turkey, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Demirel: It is an honour for me to\r\naddress this historic meeting, and on this solemn occasion\r\nto renew our pledge to the global contract of humanity.\r\nFifty years ago, the United Nations was created to be\r\na centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\r\nachieving a better world for all. The Charter of the United\r\nNations was to provide the road map to a new\r\ninternational order. However, the initial hopes and\r\naspirations of the founders turned into disillusionment\r\nduring the dark days of the cold war. Now, there is a\r\nwidespread revival of the positive spirit that prevailed half\r\na century ago.\r\nSome moments in history stand out as defining ones.\r\nAt times they can be new beginnings, in which courses\r\nare set that shape decades, even centuries. Such should be\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary. We should seize this moment to\r\nadapt the United Nations to the new challenges and\r\ndemands of our times, and in this we must not fail.\r\nThis Organization was established to be a meeting\r\npoint of men and women who believe in shared dreams.\r\nIt is intended to be a forum in search of a collective\r\nconscience.\r\nExpectations from the United Nations are rising. So\r\nare disappointments. We must improve our ability to\r\naddress problems globally.\r\nNo nation can be fully at peace while its neighbour\r\nis not. With this awareness, we must base our actions on\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nthe interlocking concepts of democratic interdependence,\r\nmarket rationale, economic cooperation, international and\r\nconstitutional legality, shared prosperity and solidarity.\r\nTogether we must resolutely resist those who try to\r\nundermine our renewed hope and vision, those who openly\r\ndefy our common values and international law.\r\nLet us have faith in our strength. Let us not forget that\r\nto go forward at all is to go forward together. Let us be\r\naware that the peoples of the world are strongly demanding\r\nthe helping hand of the United Nations. Let us not\r\ndisappoint them. Let us fashion a new plan of action to\r\ncreate a United Nations which will remain true to the ideals\r\nof its founders.\r\nTo this end, we must place preventive diplomacy at\r\nthe top of our agenda; show resolve to thwart aggression in\r\nall its forms; renew our commitments to peacemaking and\r\npeace enforcement; redouble our efforts for a\r\ncomprehensive and genuine reform process of the\r\nOrganization; create a Security Council which is more\r\nrepresentative, responsive, democratic and accountable;\r\nrevisit the idea of collective security; increase the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the regional\r\norganizations; address the problems arising from United\r\nNations-imposed sanctions and set up a mechanism for the\r\neffective implementation of Article 50 of the Charter; find\r\ncreative ways and means to secure new financial resources;\r\nand maintain people-centred development at the core of our\r\nagenda for development.\r\nWith regard to the last point, I would like to invite all\r\nHeads of State and Government to Istanbul in June 1996 to\r\ntake part in the City Summit, HABITAT II Conference, to\r\ndiscuss how sufficient housing, a healthy environment and\r\nsocial services can be provided for the billions of people\r\nliving in the cities, as well as other human settlements of\r\nthe world.\r\nThe future offers hope. Let us seize the opportunity\r\nand be firm in our commitment to our common destiny.\r\nTurkey has incurred the second highest loss of human life\r\nin peace operations under the United Nations flag. I\r\nsolemnly reiterate Turkey’s determination to continue to\r\nshoulder its share of global responsibility.\r\nWith these remarks, I would like to quote a great\r\nTurkish humanist and poet-philosopher, Yunus Emre who,\r\nseven centuries ago, made the following call to all the\r\npeoples of the world:\r\n(spoke in Turkish)\r\n“Gelin tanis olalim,\r\nIsi kolay kilalim.\r\nSevelim, sevilelim,\r\nDünya kimseye kalmaz.”\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThat means\r\n“Come, let us get to know each other,\r\nand make it easier for all of us.\r\nLet us love and be loved,\r\nFor, this world is no one’s to own forever”\r\nThis is the message I have brought to this historic\r\nmeeting from the people of a country standing at the\r\ncrossroads of continents and cultures and a country that\r\nstands dedicated to the noble principles enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Turkey for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Süleyman Demirel, President of\r\nthe Republic of Turkey, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Piero Natalino\r\nMularoni, Captain Regent of the Republic of San\r\nMarino\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Piero Natalino Mularoni\r\non behalf of the Captains Regent of the Republic of San\r\nMarino.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Piero Natalino Mularoni,\r\nCaptain Regent of the Republic of San Marino, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nCaptain Regent Mularoni (spoke in Italian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): In the space of 50\r\nyears, a man and a woman come into the world, grow up,\r\nobtain a diploma or learn a trade, get married and have\r\nchildren. Sometimes they live long enough to see and\r\nlove their grandchildren.\r\nThus, three new generations have followed the first\r\n50 years of the United Nations. A further one has to be\r\nadded, then, if one considers the generation which\r\nwitnessed the establishment of the Organization after\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nhaving experienced the tragic and painful reality of the\r\nWorld War.\r\nWar can be avoided by resorting to peaceful means, to\r\nnegotiations and through the good will of those holding\r\npower or armed force. Despite this message, however, wars\r\nare still dramatic recurring events in every part of the\r\nworld.\r\nAlthough the arrogant and ambitious desire for\r\nsupremacy remains the manifest, or concealed, cause of all\r\nwars, it is evident that — at least to a certain extent — the\r\ndetermining factors have changed.\r\nNo more wars! This is the strong and resolute appeal\r\nthat the Captains Regent of the Republic of San Marino\r\nwish to reiterate to this Assembly. Over the years, this very\r\nHall has witnessed the celebration of many achievements,\r\nthe real sharing and resolution of peoples\u0027 problems, the\r\ncondemnation of unfair treatment and dictatorships, as well\r\nas the admission of many peoples once exploited by\r\ncolonial regimes and oppressed by intolerant systems. Now,\r\nthis Assembly is looking forward to the admission of more\r\npeoples, whose right to a homeland and to a territory must\r\nbe finally recognized.\r\nNo more wars! This is the appeal of a small country\r\nwhich is also one of the newest United Nations Member\r\nStates. San Marino regards this condition as a privilege to\r\nbe proud of, and on this occasion it reaffirms its formal\r\ncommitment to contribute its own share, to the extent made\r\npossible by its territorial dimensions and real possibilities.\r\nThe United Nations has also been able to elaborate\r\nand to teach a second fundamental concept: a new law of\r\nnations and a code of conduct for States.\r\nThanks to the true nature and to the consequences of\r\nthis new law of States, the international community has\r\nstarted to reject the idea of a dangerous return to a division\r\ninto military, economic and political blocs and, at the same\r\ntime, to a new fragmentation. The contribution of all and\r\nthe setting of common goals are, in fact, the indispensable\r\nfoundations for the resolution of today’s problems.\r\nThe capacity and strength of the United Nations in\r\nconsolidating a third fundamental concept — a higher\r\nrecognition of all human rights — must be generally\r\nacknowledged. In the achievement of this ambitious goal,\r\nthe United Nations has been assisted by the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), in its sphere of competence, and by the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and\r\nthe Council of Europe, in the European area.\r\nThis last concept entails, inter alia, respect for the\r\nhuman person and human dignity; the principle of\r\ntolerance towards those who, despite all appearances, are\r\nequal to us; and respect for life, which is constantly\r\nendangered by wars, armaments, nuclear power, the death\r\npenalty and hunger. It includes respect for, and the\r\nconservation and restoration of, the environment, as an\r\nessential and primary component of life; the struggle\r\nagainst poverty, underdevelopment and the exploitation of\r\npeoples and of poverty-stricken areas; and, as a\r\nconsequence, the commitment to social justice and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nToday, solidarity must take new and more humane\r\nforms. It can no longer be expressed through charitable\r\nacts determined by exceptional circumstances. On the\r\ncontrary, solidarity has to be translated into a concerted\r\nplan of assistance and be considered a common duty of\r\nthe entire international community. This assumption leads\r\nto the consequent sharing of the problems of all and to\r\nparticipation in their resolution.\r\nMoreover, this concept asserts respect for the\r\nfundamental freedoms of all individuals and citizens and\r\nthe observance of their effective and full enjoyment, as\r\nwell as the participation of all citizens in the sharing of\r\npower, through the democratic rules of representation,\r\ntransparency, control and alternation.\r\nIn particular, the Captains Regent wish to stress the\r\nright of all peoples to land and to its natural and\r\ninalienable use, and recommend the total elimination of\r\nthe aberrant practices of slavery, torture and the death\r\npenalty. We encourage respect for, and the safeguarding\r\nof, the rights of minorities and the possibility for any\r\npeople or minority to maintain and promote their cultural\r\nidentity. Finally, the Captains Regent wish to advocate\r\npeace, the fundamental basis of which is the peaceful and\r\ndemocratic coexistence of all citizens within States, with\r\nfull respect for the rights of every human person and of\r\nall.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of the\r\nRepublic of San Marino, the Captains Regent, through\r\nthis universal Assembly, express the wish that the United\r\nNations may continue its work for many, many years, and\r\nwish it even greater success in accepting, meeting and\r\nresolving the difficult challenges of the third millennium.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nIt is our sincere hope that here, through the\r\nuniversality of this Organization, the participation of all,\r\nand the equal rights and opportunities granted to all\r\nMembers, the States may formulate with impartiality the\r\npolicies that will determine the future of each human being,\r\nensuring freedom, health, well-being and equality for all.\r\nThe President: I thank the Captain Regent of the\r\nRepublic of San Marino for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Piero Natalino Mularoni, Captain\r\nRegent of the Republic of San Marino, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The last few speakers have strictly\r\nrespected the five-minute time limit. I wish to express my\r\nappreciation to them. I wish also to appeal to the remaining\r\nspeakers to exercise the same restraint. I thank them in\r\nadvance for their cooperation.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Lennart Meri, President\r\nof the Republic of Estonia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Lennart Meri, President of\r\nthe Republic of Estonia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Lennart Meri, President of the\r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Meri: Our fathers, who fought in the First\r\nWorld War and in the wars of freedom from colonialism\r\nthat followed, which in turn inspired United States\r\nPresident Wilson’s Fourteen Points on the rights of self-\r\ndetermination, created the League of Nations.\r\nThe League of Nations embodied much idealism and\r\nlittle realism. It was not able to halt the game of division\r\nplayed by Hitler and Stalin, nor was it able to stop the\r\nagonized agitation of colonial dinosaurs or to break the\r\nchain of anti-colonial wars that followed and cost between\r\n60 million and 100 million human lives.\r\nPresident Roosevelt hoped to secure stability in the\r\nworld by a combination of realism and idealism. Idealism\r\nreigned in this world parliament, where each State, whether\r\n1 million or 1,000 million strong, was equal to the others.\r\nRealism, on the other hand, was the dominant force in the\r\nSecurity Council, in which the Allies of the Second World\r\nWar exercised the right of veto.\r\nThis is how, 50 years ago, the United Nations was\r\ncalled into life.\r\nLet us consider for a moment the numbers. When\r\nthe United Nations was conceived, there were 50 Member\r\nStates. Today, there are 185. The Republic of Estonia has\r\nfollowed this development with great attention, for three\r\nreasons.\r\nFirst, the occupation of the independent Republic of\r\nEstonia by the Red Army pushed us for 50 years into the\r\nranks of colonized peoples. We are sympathetic to their\r\nconcerns, because we value the right to self-\r\ndetermination, independence and democracy. At the same\r\ntime, we are an old democracy. We are a State that was\r\nborn out of the decomposition of an empire, as was\r\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and many other\r\nStates.\r\nThis is a unique state of affairs. We belong at the\r\nsame time to the first and the third worlds. We hold the\r\nsame values, principles and goals as the first world, and\r\nexperience the disappointments and concerns of the third\r\nworld.\r\nSecondly, one result of the end of colonial empires\r\nwas the birth of new States. Most of those States, called\r\n“new democracies”, are comparable with Estonia from the\r\nstandpoint of population and land mass. Today, and in\r\nthis Hall, this is less a geographic than a political\r\nattribute. Small States are, by definition, more easily\r\nwounded, which means that in a security vacuum small\r\nStates are more sensitive to barometric changes than large\r\nones. Besides common ideals, we also have common\r\nconcerns.\r\nThirdly, as I have noted, those States that have risen\r\nfrom the end of colonialism and neocolonialism form a\r\nmajority in our world community. Unfortunately, this is\r\na silent majority. Its voice is weak and ineffectual in this\r\nglobal forum; its voice is not present in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nI speak of this here and now because hope springs\r\neternal. For this reason, I have two proposals: first, we\r\nshould consider the idea of a rotating member in the\r\nSecurity Council chosen from among the world’s small\r\nStates. Secondly, I call upon the small States of the world\r\nto gather in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, to draft a\r\ndeclaration: the Tallinn Declaration of Small States.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nI make these proposals based on the hope that lies in\r\nthe silent majority of this world Organization. We, the\r\nsmall nations, are easily wounded; thus we are more\r\nsensitive. Because we are more sensitive, we are able to\r\nreact more quickly. Because we are able to react more\r\nquickly, we are consequently more idealistic. Small States\r\nare more idealistic, so it follows that a more active hope\r\nand a desire to remain true to our principles lives in our\r\nmidst. It was this hope, it was this dedication to principles\r\nupon which, under other circumstances, this Organization\r\nwas founded 50 years ago.\r\nBy next December, you, all the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, will receive a draft of the Tallinn\r\nDeclaration of Small States. This will allow us enough time\r\nto consider it and, next September in Tallinn, to gather\r\ntogether in order to work out a mechanism that will turn\r\nthis silent majority into a constructive majority, whose\r\ndecisions will help us to fulfil, in a constructive manner,\r\nthe purposes and principles upon which this Organization\r\nis based.\r\nBe well aware of the protocol of this historic meeting.\r\nI await your reactions here and now to my proposals, and\r\nI look forward to seeing you next September in Tallinn, the\r\ncapital town of Estonia.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Estonia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Lennart Meri, President of the\r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Kim Young Sam,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Korea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Kim Young Sam, President\r\nof the Republic of Korea.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kim Young Sam, President of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Kim (spoke in Korean; interpretation\r\nprovided by the delegation): First of all, I would like to pay\r\ntribute to the leaders who founded this world body half a\r\ncentury ago and to the courage and the hope for the future\r\nthey shared after overcoming the despair and frustration\r\nborn of two world wars. Their dreams of a better world\r\nhave already changed our planet tremendously, and have\r\naffected each one of us. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express my heartfelt respect for all those\r\nwho have spearheaded the effort to fulfil the provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nThe world is undergoing drastic change. Riding the\r\ncrest of the information age and globalization, not only is\r\nthe international order undergoing an epochal change, but\r\nhuman civilization itself is being radically transformed.\r\nChange and reform in the United Nations are\r\nnecessary if the Organization is to create and maintain the\r\nnew world order. While welcoming a series of discussions\r\nwhich have been held on reform of the United Nations, I\r\nwould like to express my views on this issue.\r\nFirst, the United Nations has to be democratized and\r\nmade more efficient; and every region of the world must\r\nbe more equitably represented on the Security Council. In\r\nparticular, I agree with many other Member nations that\r\nthe number of Council members with veto power — a\r\npower that has crippled the United Nations for a long\r\ntime — should not be raised.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations function of preventing\r\nconflict should be strengthened.\r\nThirdly, the United Nations must respond more\r\nactively to demands for economic, social and\r\nenvironmental development. In order to attain true world\r\npeace and security, economic and social conflicts in the\r\ninternational community have to be resolved at all costs.\r\nFourthly, the United Nations has to actively\r\nundertake activities that give priority to human beings and\r\nfamilies. The ideas of human security and family values\r\nput forward at the United Nations World Summit for\r\nDevelopment last March will be the most important goal\r\nfor people around the world in the twenty-first century.\r\nFifthly, new plans must be established for burden-\r\nsharing and for the administration of the additional budget\r\narising from the strengthening of United Nations\r\nfunctions. I believe that the sooner the United Nations\r\nundergoes change and reform, the better it will be for our\r\nworld. To that end, I hereby propose that a special session\r\nof the General Assembly on United Nations reform be\r\nheld.\r\nThe Republic of Korea was established in\r\naccordance with a United Nations resolution in 1948. At\r\nthat time it was one of the poorest countries in the world.\r\nToday, it is the eleventh-largest economy in the world and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\na truly democratic nation. Our success has been a great\r\nmanifestation of the ideals of the United Nations.\r\nWe are now one of the Member nations most active in\r\nUnited Nations activities around the globe. We are already\r\nparticipating in United Nations peace-keeping operations in\r\nWestern Sahara, the Republic of Georgia, Angola and\r\nelsewhere. The Republic of Korea will also actively take\r\npart in various United Nations development and\r\nenvironmental projects, and will increase its monetary\r\ncontributions. In order to help eradicate diseases among\r\nchildren around the world, the Republic of Korea is\r\nbuilding an International Vaccine Institute in Korea with\r\nhelp from the United Nations Development Programme.\r\nI am convinced that the Korean peninsula will surely\r\nbe unified in a democratic way in the not too distant future.\r\nI humbly and sincerely ask you all to become solid\r\nsupporters of the peaceful unification of Korea.\r\nI sincerely hope that this special United Nations\r\nsummit meeting will be recorded as a bright milestone in\r\nworld history. We share the cherished desire to turn the\r\ntwenty-first century into an age of a true global community\r\nin which we can coexist and prosper together. Only through\r\nour political will and participation in the United Nations\r\ncan we turn our hopes and dreams into reality.\r\nI hereby respectfully propose that a United Nations\r\nsummit meeting be held regularly, every five years, and\r\nthat its first meeting be held in the year 2000.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Korea for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kim Young Sam, President of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman, President\r\nof the Republic of Croatia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman, President of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Tudjman (spoke in Croatian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): On the threshold of a new\r\nmillennium, it is my privilege to address the greatest\r\nSummit of world leaders, by which we mark the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations\r\nOrganization.\r\nSo much power has convened today under the roof\r\nof the General Assembly Hall, and yet, so little power to\r\nprovide the necessary solutions leading to a better\r\ncommon future for our peoples and for our entire planet.\r\nWe are faced with a long and arduous road, but we can\r\nlook back with pride on the 50 years of our common\r\nhistory.\r\nThe disintegration of colonial and ideological\r\nempires has given rise to new, modern States, and the\r\nnumber of United Nations Members has increased almost\r\nfourfold since the founding of the Organization.\r\nThe historical process of democratization could not\r\nstop at mere reform of political systems, but, rather, it\r\ncalled for a comprehensive transformation. The\r\ntotalitarian Iron Curtain that cut across Europe was\r\nbrought down not only by the determined policy of the\r\nWestern democratic alliance, but also by the freedom-\r\nloving aspirations of nations having small populations and\r\na great historical heritage.\r\nDestiny has allotted to small nations the role of\r\npromoters of great ideas. They are the leaders of positive\r\nchanges in the evolution of humankind that turn the force\r\nof a struggle for national survival into a creative vision of\r\ntomorrow’s world — no longer a world of the large and\r\nsmall, the powerful and weak, but only a world of equal\r\nnations and States committed to coexistence.\r\nThe boundaries of our freedoms are set by\r\nboundaries of the freedom of others. The affirmation of\r\nhuman dignity and the universal rights of the individual\r\nupheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be\r\nachieved only through respect for different ethnic,\r\nreligious, cultural and political identities, through an\r\nefficient system of collective security, and through respect\r\nfor a law-governed State and international law. We have\r\nto turn negative energy into positive momentum. Reform\r\nof global relations and mechanisms must provide for\r\ngreater respect for civilizational differences, for their\r\ncreative blending and dialogue on an equal footing. A\r\nmultipolar world is more stable than a bipolar world and\r\nit is the future of humankind.\r\nThe global order can no longer be based solely on\r\nthe special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the\r\nnuclear club, or on economic or military power; rather,\r\nfirst and foremost, it should be based on the real\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\ncontribution of individual countries to the prevention of\r\nevery form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction; on their role within global\r\nsocio-economic development; on their democratic\r\nachievement; and on their regional importance. Thus, for\r\nexample, we must take into account the present democratic\r\nand economic resources of Germany and Japan — countries\r\ndeserving a permanent seat on the Security Council on the\r\nbasis of all criteria.\r\nThe United Nations must also be a garden of ideas\r\nrelated to general human values, international solidarity and\r\nan equitable international order. Our responsibility for\r\nnarrowing the gap in economic development and for\r\npromoting coordinated development of all parts of our\r\nplanet is equal to our responsibility for global peace.\r\nAs one of five successor States of the former\r\nYugoslavia, Croatia also considers itself a founder of the\r\nUnited Nations, a part of the heritage entered into the\r\nCharter 50 years ago. Having followed a long tradition of\r\ngreat humanistic visions — from pan-Slavic, pan-European,\r\nnon-aligned, ecumenical to universal — the people of\r\nCroatia have also incorporated the noble ideals of the\r\nCharter into their culture.\r\nThe citizens of Croatia appreciate the values of\r\nmultilateral United Nations mechanisms, through which\r\nemancipation of the Croatian State and the establishment of\r\nfull sovereignty throughout its territory have been\r\ninternationalized and achieved. On this occasion, Croatia\r\nexpresses its gratitude to the United Nations, in particular\r\nfor the enormous humanitarian effort that alleviated the\r\nsuffering of hundreds of thousands of displaced persons\r\nwithin Croatia and of refugees from neighbouring Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nWe are entering into the new round of negotiations\r\nwith the hope that they will bring about the end of the\r\ncrisis in the former Yugoslavia and find a formula for a just\r\nand lasting peace. To the citizens of Croatia and its\r\ndemocratically elected Government, a just peace means\r\nestablishing Croatia’s full sovereignty throughout its\r\nterritory within its internationally recognized borders.\r\nCroatia sincerely hopes that an agreement will soon be\r\nreached on the peaceful reintegration of 4.6 per cent of\r\nstill-occupied Croatian land. At the same time, we remain\r\nprepared to take other necessary steps as well, if timely\r\nreintegration of Eastern Slavonia, Baranya and Western\r\nSreeyem is not incorporated into the final plan for the\r\nregion.\r\nWe have shown that we have courage in war, but be\r\nassured that we have even more courage for peace.\r\nExcellencies, because of our responsibility for peace,\r\nfreedom and the well-being of our peoples, we, as\r\nleaders, must rise above all our other interests and\r\ndifferences. We, the leaders of the modern world, are\r\nfaced with a great responsibility: we must be united and\r\nrise above our distinct personal, party and national\r\ninterests, and seek the vision of a new world which will\r\nhold a future for every individual, every nation and State,\r\nfor the universality of spirit and for the tolerance of the\r\ndifferent. Let the noble visions of the new millennium\r\nrest on peace and prosperity of all nations, on harmony in\r\nthe global family of sovereign States whose common\r\nbeacon is the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Croatia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman, President of\r\nthe Republic of Croatia, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Boris N. Yeltsin,\r\nPresident of the Russian Federation\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Boris Yeltsin, President of\r\nthe Russian Federation.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boris Yeltsin, President of the\r\nRussian Federation, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Yeltsin (interpretation from Russian):\r\nHalf a century ago an event occurred that paved the way\r\nfor a new period in the history of mankind. Divided and\r\nbleeding, the world understood that its only future was the\r\npath of mutual understanding and interaction.\r\nOnly the United Nations will be able to realize the\r\nperennial dream of a world without wars and violence; of\r\na world where controversial issues are settled through\r\nnegotiation; of a world worthy of the human being and\r\nmankind.\r\nBut, while having won a world war, we have not yet\r\nmanaged to win peace. The creative capabilities of the\r\nworld community were for decades hampered by the cold\r\nwar. It neither benefited any people nor made any people\r\nany happier. The end of the cold war has become our\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\ncommon victory. Democratic Russia has made an\r\nunquestionable contribution to its achievement.\r\nNuclear missiles are no longer targeted at each other.\r\nBut such threats as terrorism, aggressive nationalism, crime\r\nand drug abuse are now aimed at each and every one of us.\r\nAlong with integration, the rifts of estrangement and\r\ndistrust among States and peoples are emerging.\r\nThere is a dangerous tendency to play down the role\r\nof the United Nations, to circumvent its Charter and the\r\ncollective will of the Security Council.\r\nToday, the world more than ever before needs not\r\nonly equality and tolerance, but also respect for the identity\r\nof each State and an understanding of the peculiarities of its\r\nhistory. Each of them is able and willing to make its\r\ncontribution to the development of the world community\r\nand to find an adequate place therein. We should not allow\r\nthe revival of the atmosphere of animosity and prejudice\r\nagainst countries and peoples.\r\nDoes the United Nations have the ability to achieve\r\nthese goals? In the opinion of Russia, it does. The United\r\nNations can and should become the main instrument for\r\nbuilding new international relations. It has all the necessary\r\npowers to do so. To carry out this mission it should be\r\nprovided with appropriate means, including financial\r\nresources. Russia meets, and will continue to meet, its\r\nobligations to the United Nations.\r\nCertainly, the United Nations has not been able to\r\nachieve success in all areas, but the roots of its failure lie,\r\nfirst and foremost, in ourselves, in the behaviour of States\r\nand organizations.\r\nRussia is concerned at the situation in which, as has\r\nrecently been the case in Bosnia, the Security Council was\r\nrelegated to the sidelines of events. It represents an obvious\r\nand clear-cut violation of the basic principles of the world\r\nOrganization, laid down by its founders. It is inadmissible\r\nfor a regional organization to take decisions on the massive\r\nuse of force, bypassing the Security Council.\r\nRussia has worked hard to bring peace closer in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We are ready to support the\r\noperation on the implementation of a peace agreement with\r\nthe participation of multinational forces, including Russian\r\nforces, but only under a clear-cut mandate of the United\r\nNations Security Council. Military force should never be\r\nused in those cases where diplomacy has not been given\r\nenough time to succeed. The effects of that would be tragic.\r\nRecently there has been much discussion about the\r\ndifficult task of revitalizing the United Nations. A lively\r\ndebate is under way on the issue of the enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council. We advocate such a reorganization\r\nprovided only, of course, that the responsibility of the\r\nSecurity Council is increased and the interests of different\r\nregions of the world are taken into account.\r\nThe main concern of Russia is to achieve stability in\r\nEurope and Asia. We are in favour of establishing a\r\nsecurity system based on compromises rather than on\r\npressure. European security is indivisible: there is no\r\nalternative to that. It is precisely for this reason that\r\nRussia supports the idea of the earliest possible\r\nestablishment of a new system of all-European security\r\nwherein all European States would be represented. And\r\nthis is precisely the reason why we are against the\r\neastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization. It will put a barrier in the way of the\r\nestablishment of a unified Europe.\r\nThe question is an extremely acute one: either such\r\na system would be established for all of Europe or, as in\r\nthe past, only for a select few. The strengthening of one\r\nbloc today means new confrontation tomorrow. This is\r\nnot the way to build a just world order. It should be\r\nbased on different principles.\r\nRussia is in favour of a world order in which\r\npriority is given to international law and international\r\ncooperation.\r\nRussia is in favour of a world order in which a\r\ncomprehensive security system is put into effect. Russia\r\nis in favour of a world order in which steady advance is\r\nensured towards a world free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, a world in which the reduction of\r\nconventional weapons is under way.\r\nWe are in favour of a world order in which the role\r\nof the United Nations as an instrument for achieving\r\npeace, settling conflicts and providing development\r\nassistance is increasing.\r\nRussia proposes the holding in 1999 of a third Peace\r\nConference. The first one took place in 1899 at the\r\ninitiative of our country. The third one may be devoted\r\nsolely to developing the bases for the settlement of\r\nconflicts emerging after the cold war.\r\nIt is also necessary to find a solution to long-\r\nstanding issues, especially issues such as nuclear\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\ndisarmament, the complete cessation of nuclear-weapon\r\ntests and control over conventional weapons.\r\nToday, as 50 years ago, we should unite once again to\r\neliminate the legacy of the cold war and to find worthy\r\nanswers to the challenges of our times.\r\nThe United Nations represents the common will of the\r\nStates of the world. Let us act in accordance with its norms\r\nand principles. And then, peace, justice and international\r\nlaw will prevail on Earth. Russia believes in the United\r\nNations, which was born in the middle of the twentieth\r\ncentury and is making its way firmly into the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Russian\r\nFederation for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boris Yeltsin, President of the\r\nRussian Federation, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Fidel Castro Ruz,\r\nPresident of the Council of State and the Council of\r\nMinisters of the Republic of Cuba\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Fidel Castro Ruz, President\r\nof the Council of State and the Council of Ministers of the\r\nRepublic of Cuba.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the\r\nCouncil of State and the Council of Ministers of the\r\nRepublic of Cuba, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Castro Ruz (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nHalf a century ago the United Nations was born after the\r\nconclusion of a monstrous war, at the peak of which an\r\naverage of 10 million lives were lost. At present, 20 million\r\nmen, women and children are dying of hunger and curable\r\ndiseases every year. In some wealthy nations there is a life\r\nexpectancy of up to 80 years while in other nations there is\r\nan expectancy of hardly 40, so there are billions whose\r\nlives are cut off. How long shall we wait for this carnage\r\nto end?\r\nThe cold war is over but the arms race goes on, and\r\nnuclear and military hegemonism perpetuate themselves.\r\nHow long shall we wait for the complete removal of all\r\nweapons of mass extermination, for universal disarmament\r\nand for the elimination of the use of force, arrogance and\r\npressure in international relations?\r\nThe obsolete veto privilege and the ill-use of the\r\nSecurity Council by the powerful are exalting a new\r\ncolonialism within the very United Nations.\r\nLatin America and Africa do not have a single\r\npermanent member in the Security Council. In Asia, India\r\nhas a population of almost one billion but it does not\r\nenjoy that responsibility.\r\nHow long, how long shall we wait for the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations and for the\r\nindependence and sovereign equality of States to become\r\na reality? How long before non-intervention in the\r\ninternal affairs of States and true international cooperation\r\ntake their rightful places?\r\nBreakthroughs in science and technology are\r\nincreasing daily in number but their benefits do not reach\r\nthe majority of mankind and they continue essentially to\r\nbe at the service of a reckless consumerism which is\r\nwasting limited resources and seriously threatening life on\r\nEarth. How long shall we have to wait before rationality,\r\nequity and justice prevail in the world?\r\nMr. Zeroual (President of Algeria), Vice-President\r\nof the General Assembly, took the Chair.\r\nThe forests are decreasing, the air is being poisoned,\r\nthe rivers are being contaminated. Countless species of\r\nplants and animals are perishing. The soils are\r\nimpoverished. Old and new epidemics are expanding,\r\nwhile the population grows and the legions of the\r\ndispossessed continue to multiply.\r\nWill the next generations reach the promised land\r\npledged half a century ago? How many hundreds of\r\nmillions have already died without ever seeing it? How\r\nmany have fallen victim to oppression, plunder, poverty,\r\nhunger and unhealthy living conditions? How many more\r\nwill still die?\r\nWe lay claim to a world without hegemonism,\r\nwithout nuclear weapons, without interventionism. without\r\nracism, without national or religious hatred, without\r\noutrageous acts against the sovereignty of any country, a\r\nworld with respect for the independence and self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, a world without universal\r\nmodels that totally disregard the traditions and culture of\r\nall the components of mankind.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nWe lay claim to a world without ruthless blockades\r\nthat cause the death of men, women and children, young\r\nand old, like noiseless atom bombs.\r\nWe lay claim to a world of peace, justice and dignity\r\nwhere everyone, without exception, has the right to well-\r\nbeing and to life.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nthank the President of the Council of State and the Council\r\nof Ministers of the Republic of Cuba for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the\r\nCouncil of State and the Council of Ministers of the\r\nRepublic of Cuba, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah\r\nMu’izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan\r\nof Brunei Darussalam\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will next hear an address by His Majesty\r\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan\r\nand Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nHis Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin\r\nWaddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei\r\nDarussalam, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nHis Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin\r\nWaddaulah: I am delighted to join you in celebrating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. In doing so, I\r\nconvey the best wishes of my Government and the people\r\nof Brunei Darussalam. We greet you in the spirit of peace\r\nand international friendship.\r\nWe are commemorating a unique historic event. No\r\ninternational organization has endured for five decades. The\r\nLeague of Nations failed after less than three. That the\r\nUnited Nations has survived the long and dangerous years\r\nof the cold war is no small achievement. Among its many\r\nother achievements is the way it eased the path from\r\ncolonization to independence for more than 100 countries.\r\nIt is fashionable to criticize the United Nations. Some\r\nof the criticisms are valid. Bosnia and Rwanda represent\r\nfailures of will and policy that will haunt all Members for\r\na long time. We should also have more rigorous financial\r\ncontrols over spending, and Members must honour their\r\ndues so that the United Nations can have the resources to\r\ncarry out its mandates.\r\nBut let us not forget: it is we ourselves as Members\r\nwho must take the ultimate responsibility for its failures,\r\nbecause as an Organization of sovereign States the United\r\nNations can do no more than its Members empower it to\r\ndo.\r\nThe shortcomings of some peace-keeping operations\r\nshould not obscure the honour due those who have\r\nsacrificed their lives in many successful peace-keeping\r\nand humanitarian operations. We owe much to them.\r\nWe must also give credit to the United Nations for\r\nthe sterling service rendered by its specialized agencies.\r\nHealth, education, agriculture and the work of other\r\nspecialized agencies may not have captured the headlines,\r\nbut they have contributed much to the making of a better\r\nworld. Many dedicated professionals and volunteers have\r\ngiven valuable, if unpublicized, service.\r\nThe international environment today is vastly\r\ndifferent from that of 1945. We face new global issues,\r\neven while several old ones still remain to be solved.\r\nEconomics is high on the international agenda. Free\r\nmarkets and open competition have become a basis for\r\neconomic cooperation. That most countries in the world\r\nare now concentrating on economic issues is an advance\r\nover a world preoccupied with ideological conflicts.\r\nThe United Nations is still the best Organization to\r\nuphold a world order based on international law and the\r\nprinciples of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nInterdependence between nations has increased but has\r\nnot displaced the sovereignty of nations as the basic\r\nprinciple in international relations.\r\nThe United Nations gives all Members, large and\r\nsmall, an equal voice. This is important for small States\r\nlike Brunei Darussalam. The United Nations must change\r\nto meet new challenges, but I hope it will continue to\r\ngive small nations an adequate voice in its deliberations.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Brunei Darussalam pledges to\r\nwork with fellow Members to ensure that the United\r\nNations remains a force for peace and progress.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI thank His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin\r\nWaddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei\r\nDarussalam, for his statement.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHis Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin\r\nWaddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei\r\nDarussalam, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Hugo Batalla, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will next hear a statement by His Excellency\r\nMr. Hugo Batalla, Vice-President of the Eastern Republic\r\nof Uruguay.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hugo Batalla, Vice-President of\r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Batalla (interpretation from Spanish): As the\r\nrepresentative of Uruguay, a nation with a deep-seated\r\ndemocratic tradition and a founding Member of the United\r\nNations, I would not wish to make use of this lofty and\r\nuniversal podium merely to engage in rhetoric celebrating\r\nthe first half-century of the San Francisco Charter.\r\nIt would be pointless for us to come here today to run\r\nthrough the political successes the United Nations has\r\nachieved over these 50 years, though successes it has had\r\nindeed, on the basis of the universalization of the idea of\r\nfreedom and democracy, to which it made a decisive\r\ncontribution. Nor shall we emphasize the aspects relating to\r\nthe sustainable development of mankind which over the\r\nsame period not only have remained unresolved but in large\r\nareas of the world have become considerably worse.\r\nUruguay has for many years been actively and\r\nincreasingly involved in the maintenance of peace, a\r\nfundamental task of the United Nations in which major\r\nsuccesses have been achieved.\r\nCurrently, in terms of our population and the size of\r\nour armed forces, we are the world’s major contributor of\r\npersonnel to peace-keeping operations.\r\nNevertheless, these operations cannot be transformed\r\ninto the Organization’s priority objective; rather, the\r\nessential part of the activities of the United Nations must\r\nfocus on preventing conflicts that affect international peace\r\nand security, and to this end its role as a forum for ongoing\r\ndialogue where disputes are discussed and resolved by\r\npeaceful means needs to be strengthened.\r\nFundamental as it is, silencing weapons does not put\r\nan end to the most serious scourge of mankind, namely the\r\nhunger and abject poverty which hundreds of millions of\r\nhuman beings are suffering.\r\nHunger, poverty and subhuman living conditions\r\nhave claimed more victims in the world than all wars\r\ntaken together. They have decimated and continue to\r\ndecimate entire peoples in various regions. At this very\r\nmoment, millions of children are dying of hunger, at a\r\ntime when hundreds of millions of square kilometres of\r\nfertile land lie unexploited or underexploited as a result,\r\namong other things, of the prevailing economic\r\nconditions, inequitable international trading relations and\r\nthe crushing debt burden.\r\nFreedom and democracy are tender plants and their\r\nstability is constantly threatened if nations do not at the\r\nsame time achieve an appropriate and just economic and\r\nsocial environment. The persistence of acute\r\nmanifestations of underdevelopment, apart from forcing\r\nmillions of people to live degrading lives — something\r\nwhich the moral conscience of mankind cannot tolerate —\r\nalso constitutes a latent and persistent threat to the\r\nsecurity of all. The success in silencing the guns in\r\nvarious conflicts and the contribution to the elimination of\r\napartheid and to the tearing down of the solid edifice of\r\ncolonialism that had lasted almost five centuries are\r\nundoubtedly — among others — great achievements of\r\nthe international community, and the United Nations can\r\njustly feel proud of them. But the Organization now needs\r\nto rethink itself in order to devote all its resources —\r\nhuman, financial, institutional and technical — to the\r\ngreat undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and\r\nsocial imbalances and the related problems of the\r\nenvironment, in the conviction that this is not only a\r\nmoral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening\r\npeace.\r\nThe so-called underdeveloped world is not calling on\r\nthe international community for hand-outs or privileged\r\npositions in trade; all it is asking for is fair, transparent\r\nand egalitarian treatment, with terms of trade that are not\r\ndistorted by political pricing, hidden subsidies and\r\ndumping — practices whose persistence in international\r\ntrade causes real havoc in the economies of a large\r\nnumber of nations.\r\nThe demands of the new international situation also\r\nmake it desirable for the United Nations to establish\r\ncloser links of cooperation and coordination — especially\r\nin the field of human rights — with the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, whose membership covers the\r\nbroadest political, ideological and philosophical spectrum\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nof nations, thus ensuring the pluralism from which\r\ndemocracy draws its strength.\r\nUnless the Organization effectively demonstrates its\r\nability to guarantee the international legal order over and\r\nabove \"international policies\" dominated by the most\r\npowerful nations, under which economic and trade\r\nembargoes are imposed and the principles of non-\r\nintervention are violated, the international system will\r\nwithout doubt soon be in its painful and prolonged death\r\nthroes.\r\nToday, as we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Organization we are, for all the foregoing reasons,\r\nliving through an anxious and uncertain present in which\r\neven human values themselves are called in question. It is\r\nour responsibility to look ahead and, all of us working\r\ntogether, to build on today’s anxiety a brighter tomorrow in\r\nwhich all people, whatever their colour, their gender, their\r\nreligious creed or the place where they live, will have the\r\nright, recognized as theirs by the international community,\r\nto a life of dignity with access to all the benefits that\r\ncivilization affords.\r\nThe eyes of the world are on us today; we are being\r\ncalled on to take up this challenge, to which Uruguay\r\npledges its best efforts. Time will tell if we have been able\r\nto fulfil this hope which we must awaken in all our fellow\r\nhuman beings.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nthank the Vice-President of the Eastern Republic of\r\nUruguay for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hugo Batalla, Vice-President of\r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable James\r\nBrendan Bolger, Prime Minister of New Zealand\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His Excellency\r\nThe Right Honourable James Brendan Bolger, Prime\r\nMinister of New Zealand.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable James Brendan\r\nBolger, Prime Minister of New Zealand, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nMr. Bolger (New Zealand): Fifty years ago a vision\r\nwas bravely stated of a world with equal rights for all, free\r\nfrom poverty and the scourge of war. Today we claim not\r\nvictory, but progress.\r\nFifty years on the world is very different. The family\r\nof nations is larger and more diverse. Communications\r\ntechnology means that we live in a world without walls.\r\nThat brings a profound change in the way our global\r\nneighbourhood operates. It is changing the dynamics of\r\npolitics and business. Small countries, as well as large,\r\ncan play a full part in a true global economy.\r\nWhile aid is important in meeting immediate needs,\r\ntrue independence and prosperity will only come through\r\ngenuine free trade, which enables each country to use its\r\nresources to the best advantage. The new World Trade\r\nOrganization has much to do to achieve that goal. The\r\nnations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\r\n(APEC) agreed in Bogor last year to free trade by 2010\r\nfor the industrial nations of this important Asia-Pacific\r\ngroup, and by 2020 for the developing members. We now\r\nneed this sort of political courage on a global scale.\r\nGlobal free trade is an idea whose time has come.\r\nEqually, the time has come for a new commitment\r\nto a world free of nuclear weapons. This Assembly, in its\r\nvery first session, grappled with the nuclear problem and\r\nasked for proposals for the elimination of atomic\r\nweapons. New Zealand believed then, as now, that\r\nnuclear weapons should be eliminated. Some progress has\r\nalready been achieved. Several States have abandoned\r\ntheir nuclear capability and some nuclear-weapon States\r\nare making significant reductions to their nuclear\r\narsenals — an action which New Zealand applauds.\r\nAgainst this background New Zealand finds it\r\ninexplicable and unacceptable that China and France are\r\nstill testing nuclear weapons. Continued nuclear\r\nexplosions send all the wrong signals. What we need is a\r\nstrategy to achieve the goal of eliminating nuclear\r\nweapons. It is not an impossible goal. All member nations\r\nwhich are parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty are\r\nalready committed to a world without nuclear weapons.\r\nIt is only a question of how we achieve it.\r\nThe welcome announcement that the United States,\r\nBritain and France will support the South Pacific Nuclear-\r\nFree Zone Treaty is a positive step forward. Next year we\r\nmust complete the comprehensive test-ban treaty. Then\r\nwe must ban the production of uranium and plutonium for\r\nnuclear weapons. And there must be further substantial\r\nreductions in the nuclear arsenals of all five nuclear\r\nPowers. Then the hope of the first session of this\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nAssembly, of a future without nuclear weapons, will be\r\nwithin our grasp.\r\nIn arguing for a world without nuclear weapons, I\r\nwish to state with equal firmness that global security cannot\r\nbe separated from global prosperity and human rights.\r\nEconomic development and good governance will help to\r\neliminate those sources of tension which tempt States to\r\ninvest in arms, the infrastructure of death, rather than health\r\nand education, which are the infrastructure of life.\r\nThose who founded this Organization had a vision of\r\na better world. Some of that vision has been achieved. The\r\nUnited Nations decolonization efforts are an important\r\nexample. The spread of human rights and democracy and\r\nUnited Nations support for the role of women, for a fair\r\ntrading system, for the protection of the environment — all\r\nthese achievements must be recognized and celebrated.\r\nToday the generation raised in the shadow of the cold\r\nwar has the opportunity to direct its energy to the protection\r\nand enhancement of the planet, not its destruction, and to\r\nuse technology to share information, provide education and\r\nenhance the wonders of medical science.\r\nLet us put religious and other differences to one side\r\nand learn to live with diversity. There is so much we can\r\naccomplish by working together.\r\nTo achieve these goals, and more, we will have to\r\nrenew our Organization. The Security Council must be\r\nreformed, and waste and duplication eliminated. Members\r\nof the United Nations must break the bad habit of expecting\r\nsomething for nothing. To make our Organization work, all\r\nmust pay their dues.\r\nThe United Nations is a bold concept. It brings the\r\nnations of the world together in a grand coalition to share\r\nthe burden of building a better and more peaceful world.\r\nLet each of us, in this fiftieth-anniversary year, renew our\r\ncommitment to achieving that goal, and in doing so pay\r\ntribute to those who have pursued the work of the United\r\nNations these last 50 years.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nthank the Prime Minister of New Zealand for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. James Brendan Bolger, Prime\r\nMinister of New Zealand, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jozef Oleksy, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Poland\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will next hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jozef Oleksy, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Poland.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jozef Oleksy, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Poland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Oleksy: The present jubilee of the United\r\nNations is conducive to joint reflection on the state of the\r\nworld today, a reflection focused on concern for the fate\r\nof what is only one Earth.\r\nFor several years now, the world order imposed by\r\nthe cold war, founded upon a confrontational, bipolar\r\npower arrangement, a balance of terror and military\r\nmight, has passed into history. We must therefore\r\nparticipate soberly and imaginatively in a forward-\r\nlooking manner, refusing to be swayed by stereotypes,\r\ncomplexes and old resentments, in the process of shaping\r\nour mutual relations.\r\nLet the evolution of my country’s relations with\r\nGermany serve as an example. It was Poland which a\r\nyear ago proposed to the General Assembly that the\r\narchaic enemy-States clause be removed from the United\r\nNations Charter. “Cold peace” is not an acceptable option\r\nas a prescription for our post-cold-war times. We must\r\nnot allow new Berlin Walls, this time of an economic\r\nnature, or Iron Curtains, cutting across the continent and\r\nseparating nations, to re-emerge in Europe. We need more\r\nChannel Tunnels.\r\nThe message behind these observations reaches\r\nbeyond the old continent. Overcoming the development\r\ngap between North and South, along with its grave social\r\nimplications, must become the overriding goal of this\r\nOrganization. It must at last spur us to action, not merely\r\nprovoke lamentations over supposedly inexorable trends.\r\nEvery State can and should take a critical and\r\ncreative view of its geopolitical situation. Let us seek\r\nfriends near and far and enemies nowhere. Let me again\r\nrefer to my own country. We have traditionally — and,\r\nfor that matter, not unreasonably — regarded Poland’s\r\ngeopolitical situation to be unfavourable, even disastrous.\r\nMore than once it was Poland’s lot to be caught in a vice.\r\nNow we now have learned the lesson, and we know how\r\nto make the most of our situation. Poland has a chance of\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nacting as a keystone between Atlantic Europe and the east\r\nof Europe. After all, it borders countries of both the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States. We seek to\r\ncontribute to uniting Europe. We have succeeded in\r\nconcluding treaties of friendship and good-neighbourly\r\nrelations with each and every one of our neighbours. After\r\nall, not one of them is exactly the same neighbour that we\r\nhad only a few years ago.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe cornerstone of the foreign policy pursued by the\r\nsuccessive Governments of Poland after 1989 has been a\r\ndetermined “drive to Europe”, an orientation towards\r\nintegration with the European Union and entry into the\r\nEuro-Atlantic structures. In no way does this mean turning\r\nour back on others, whether in the East — especially\r\nRussia, Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic States — or the\r\nSouth — the regions and nations of the third world,\r\nincluding China, which is the largest and, in the last few\r\nyears, the fastest growing of them all. Despite the burden\r\nof the radical reforms under way, we do not intend to shut\r\nourselves within our borders or those of the subregion.\r\nOur rank among the nations committing Blue Helmets\r\nto the various trouble spots around the globe is conclusive\r\nevidence that we are capable of looking beyond our own\r\nback yard. It is with this intent that we have resolved to\r\nseek election to the Security Council, a supreme body\r\nresponsible for maintaining peace on a global scale.\r\nOf a similar stamp is Poland’s active role in the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and the Council of Europe, as well as our guest\r\nstatus in the Non-Aligned Movement. All this is in tune\r\nwith and complements our striving to enter the European\r\nUnion, NATO, the Western European Union and, hopefully,\r\nbefore very long, the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD). That is how we\r\nunderstand active sovereignty. Everyone should ask himself\r\nthe question, “What can I do to help others, to build a\r\nbetter world?”\r\nWe often try to fend off charges levelled — fairly or\r\notherwise — at the United Nations, as if they had nothing\r\nto do with us. Yet the credit or blame for its effectiveness\r\nor inefficiency falls on us. That depends on the degree of\r\nconsensus in our midst and our readiness to contribute to\r\nthe Organization’s budget and support its activities in\r\nvarious fields. Both are crucial also to the fate of reforms\r\nin the United Nations system, improved coordination of its\r\nactions and a better harmonization of its objectives, as the\r\ndeveloping countries urge, not without justification.\r\nThe world needs devoted leadership, commitment\r\nand far-sighted vision as much as it needs oxygen. It\r\nneeds perseverance in the promotion of trust between\r\nStates and their organizations, between nations and\r\nbetween people. In developing these values and providing\r\nenlightened guidelines, a reinforced United Nations can\r\nand should play a special role with a view to transcending\r\nglobal zero-sum games.\r\nIf we, the United Nations — united not, as 50 years\r\nago, against someone, but driven by the desire for\r\npeaceful cooperation — show sufficient determination to\r\ngive effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at\r\nmajor conferences such as those held under United\r\nNations auspices in recent years, the world stands a\r\nchance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. It stands a chance of ensuring lasting peace\r\nand sustained development for all and ensuring respect for\r\nthe rights of the citizens of this globe. It stands a chance\r\nof realizing the lofty purposes of the Charter, which\r\nremains the Organization’s signpost in the service of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Poland for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jozef Oleksy, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Poland, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Ms. Gro Harlem\r\nBrundtland, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nNorway\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by Her Excellency Ms. Gro Harlem Brundtland,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nHer Excellency Ms. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMs. Gro Harlem Brundtland: To millions of\r\npeople, the United Nations has meant food where there\r\nwas none, vaccination where epidemics raged, a school to\r\nattend, a new well in the village, and Blue Helmets who\r\nkept belligerents apart, shielding civil life.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nTo scores of new nations, access to this rostrum meant\r\nsovereignty and self-determination. From this rostrum, for\r\n50 years, all countries have been able to call for world\r\nattention.\r\nTo the hundreds of thousands of good and dedicated\r\npeople who have served the United Nations, let us pay our\r\ntribute. To the peace-keepers and field-workers who did not\r\nreturn, among them our second Secretary-General, let us\r\npay our respect.\r\nBut let us not only commemorate the past. Let us also\r\nchart a new beginning. Though the United Nations today\r\nfaces great difficulties, we, the Member States, are\r\nresponsible.\r\nThe ploughshare that worked for five decades is worn.\r\nLet us forge a new one.\r\nToday I will address five pressing issues.\r\nFirst, there is the issue of finance. Some dozen\r\nparliaments hold this Organization hostage by withholding\r\ntheir membership fees. How unworthy. We must all pay our\r\nfees in full and on time. We require some countries to pay\r\nmore than their fair share. Other countries voluntarily pay\r\nmore than their fair share. Many countries pay too little or\r\nhardly anything at all.\r\nSecondly, we must reform. Change and renewal is a\r\nmust for every effective organization. Reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is needed, where the issue of a regionally\r\nbalanced enlargement now must be addressed — the most\r\nobvious candidates being, of course, Japan and Germany —\r\nwhile the Council’s decision-making efficiency must be\r\nretained and its implementation ability greatly enhanced.\r\nResponsibility for sustainable development, poverty,\r\npopulation, education and the environment is spread out.\r\nMandates overlap. Let us draw up a schedule for\r\nimplementing what we have decided in Rio, Cairo,\r\nCopenhagen and Beijing. We meant what we said. Now, let\r\nus do it.\r\nThirdly, we must coordinate our humanitarian\r\nassistance activities better, allowing us to react more\r\nquickly and more effectively. Funds, people and resources\r\noften prove to be available only when human suffering has\r\nworsened enough to dominate the evening news, while\r\nother tragedies of famine, environmental degradation and\r\nunderdevelopment remain unnoticed.\r\nFourthly, we must improve our peace-keeping and\r\nconflict-prevention capacity to save more lives and to\r\nsave expenses. Delayed action is costly in terms of human\r\nsuffering and resources, and more countries must\r\ncontribute. We need better stand-by arrangements; we\r\nneed sharing of experience and training.\r\nFifthly, we must build the civilized world on law\r\nand contract, an international society where the strong are\r\njust and the weak secure, as President Kennedy of the\r\nUnited States phrased it right here in this Hall. We need\r\naffirmative action in the interest of our poorest members.\r\nWe need an international public or civic sector and a\r\nconscientious human rights watch here in the United\r\nNations. We must bring justice where the limits are\r\noverstepped and support the new international courts,\r\nincluding an international criminal court, to make a\r\ncivilized world.\r\nA new step towards this civilized world will be\r\ntaken when the Middle East peace process is successfully\r\ncompleted. A new step towards this civilized world will\r\nbe taken when anti-personnel mines are prohibited, so that\r\nthe children of war-torn areas can walk safely in the\r\nfields. A new step towards this civilized world will be\r\ntaken when the new test-ban takes effect.\r\nThere can be no civilized world unless we unite to\r\nstrengthen multilateralism. In this endeavour, the United\r\nNations is our repository of hope.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Norway for her statement.\r\nHer Excellency Ms. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Felipe González,\r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Felipe González,\r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Felipe González, President of the\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nMr. González (interpretation from Spanish): As\r\nPresident of the Government of Spain and on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, I have particular satisfaction in\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\naddressing the General Assembly in this solemn Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, presided over by such an\r\neminent personality as Professor Freitas do Amaral and\r\nwith the presence of the Secretary-General, whose work\r\ndeserves our recognition.\r\nThe birth of our Organization, so closely linked to the\r\nend of a tragic war, enshrined certain principles that formed\r\nthe basis of the common effort to fulfil mankind’s\r\naspirations: peace, freedom, human dignity and economic\r\nand social progress.\r\nThe great suffering caused in Europe by the wars that\r\nduring this century pitted our peoples against each other\r\nmade us look upon the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of San Francisco for the inspiration required to\r\nbring together our wills.\r\nThe European Union is a common project for living\r\ntogether in peace, for shared political, economic and social\r\nvalues, which has enabled Europe to re-emerge from its\r\nashes and to establish itself as a focal point of stability and\r\nprogress in the international arena.\r\nThis project is driven by our solidarity in the task of\r\nbuilding an international community which is freer, more\r\njust and safer.\r\nThe European Union salutes the achievements of the\r\nOrganization and reiterates its commitment to the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter. The universality of the United\r\nNations reinforces its role as a centre for harmonizing the\r\nefforts to advance on this path. One cannot conceive of\r\ntoday’s world without considering the contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations to the process of decolonization, to\r\nenvironment and development issues, and to the\r\nconsecration of innovative concepts, such as the common\r\nheritage of mankind. The fundamental contribution of our\r\nOrganization to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, to disarmament and the prevention of the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to the\r\ncodification of international law and to the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights attests to the universality of the\r\nUnited Nations and constitutes its legitimizing force.\r\nThese achievements do not conceal the setbacks\r\nsuffered by the United Nations, nor its structural and\r\nmanagement problems. Its shortcomings, which we all share\r\nwith the Organization, must be surmounted through honest\r\nand profound reflection, if it is to successfully confront the\r\nchallenges facing us at the close of this century.\r\nThe European Union has been able to express in\r\nconcrete terms its commitment to the United Nations. The\r\n15 States members of the Union represent, collectively\r\nand by far, the main contributor to the budgets of this\r\nOrganization, as well as the main contributor of personnel\r\nto peace-keeping operations. The European Union is also\r\nthe principal donor of funds for humanitarian assistance\r\nand for development cooperation.\r\nFurthermore, the States members of the European\r\nUnion have submitted initiatives with a view to promoting\r\nthe ideals of the Organization in areas such as\r\ndisarmament, human rights and humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe political commitment of the Member States to\r\nthe Organization and the contribution of adequate\r\nresources represent for the European Union two\r\ninseparable aspects of the support that the United Nations\r\nneeds. Only the existence of a viable financial basis will\r\nallow for the success of the efforts towards the\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations system, to which the\r\nEuropean Union attaches great importance. Hence, the\r\nUnion hopes that all States, large and small, will\r\ncontribute to this task through the full, punctual and\r\nunconditional fulfilment of their financial obligations.\r\nWe need an effective Organization — one that\r\nresponds to the conflicts with an enhanced capacity for\r\npreventive diplomacy and humanitarian assistance, for\r\npeace-keeping and peacemaking and for rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction once conflicts have been overcome.\r\nThere is a need for the United Nations system to\r\nintensify its work with a view to eradicating hunger and\r\npoverty, unemployment and social marginalization; to\r\nprotecting human rights; and to promoting education,\r\nhealth, and the equality of men and women. There is also\r\na need for the United Nations to coordinate the efforts\r\ntowards sustainable development that reaches everyone\r\nand allows for the preservation of our environment and\r\nthe welfare of future generations. In this endeavour, we\r\nneed, finally, to commit and arouse the enthusiasm of all\r\nsectors of our respective societies, especially the young,\r\nso that their concerns may inspire our efforts.\r\nOnly thus shall we be able to secure the foundations\r\nof peace for the better and more just world that we want.\r\nThis is the demanding task that continues to give a\r\nprofound meaning to our Organization. In the pursuit of\r\nthis collective task the United Nations can rely on the\r\nactive commitment of the European Union.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Felipe González, President of the\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Tomiichi Murayama,\r\nPrime Minister of Japan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Tomiichi Murayama,\r\nPrime Minister of Japan.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tomiichi Murayama, Prime\r\nMinister of Japan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Murayama (Japan) (spoke in Japanese;\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It gives me great\r\npleasure to join this gathering on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to convey two messages.\r\nFirst, I wish to express the gratitude of the people of\r\nJapan to the international community. At the time the\r\nUnited Nations was founded Japan was striving to recover\r\nfrom the devastation of the war and to engage in national\r\nreconstruction. Firmly resolved that the scourge of war\r\nmust never be repeated, Japan adopted its Peace\r\nConstitution. Since then, in accordance with its basic\r\nphilosophy as a peace-loving nation — including non-resort\r\nto the use of force prohibited by its Constitution — Japan\r\nhas made cooperation with the United Nations an important\r\npillar of its foreign policy and has thus been contributing\r\nactively to the peace and prosperity of the international\r\ncommunity. Japan has never forgotten the support it\r\nreceived from many members of the international\r\ncommunity in building the economic prosperity it enjoys\r\ntoday.\r\nSecondly, I should like to stress that the role of the\r\nUnited Nations is growing and diversifying. As we\r\napproach the next century, how humankind will deal with\r\nthe population explosion is becoming a serious issue. As a\r\nresult, securing a stable food supply and environmental\r\nprotection are becoming greater challenges. It is also of\r\nincreasing importance that we deal effectively with other\r\nglobal issues, such as those of refugees and AIDS.\r\nMoreover, we are witnessing with profound concern the\r\ngrave conflicts arising from religious and ethnic rivalries\r\nthat transcend national boundaries. In many instances\r\npoverty and social instability lie at the root of these\r\ndifficult problems. The United Nations has an increasingly\r\nimportant role to play in addressing these issues more\r\neffectively and in building world peace and prosperity.\r\nWhat is required of us if the United Nations is to\r\nplay such a role is that we not limit our concern to the\r\nnation State level, but also that we focus our efforts on\r\nthe well-being of each and every one of “Earth’s\r\ncitizens”. The part to be played by women and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations continues to grow. Hence a\r\nnew concept — human security — in addition to that of\r\nnational security, has emerged as a major challenge for\r\nthe United Nations. This concept, which embraces respect\r\nfor the human rights of every citizen on Earth and the\r\nprotection of each of us from poverty, disease, ignorance,\r\noppression and violence, is consonant with my own\r\npolitical principles. Since I became Prime Minister, the\r\ncreation of a human-centred society, in which all citizens\r\nare treated equally and are able to realize their full\r\npotential, has been pivotal to my administration’s policy.\r\nAt the World Summit for Social Development last March\r\nI emphasized people-centred social development as an\r\narea of priority.\r\nAs a leading donor country, Japan has been\r\nsupporting the concept of sustainable development, has\r\nbeen providing assistance for the promotion of democracy\r\nand economic reform and has been striving to extend a\r\nbroad range of economic cooperation, including\r\ncooperation to meet global challenges. Japan is also\r\nadvocating a new development strategy that focuses on\r\ncombining various policy measures in a comprehensive\r\nmanner. It intends to play an even more expanded role in\r\nthese areas. Japan also stands ready to cooperate more\r\nactively for peace in such areas as humanitarian\r\nassistance; preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping\r\noperations; and arms control and disarmament, in respect\r\nof nuclear weapons as well as conventional weapons such\r\nas anti-personnel land-mines and small arms.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is also\r\nthe fiftieth year since the tragedies of Hiroshima and\r\nNagasaki. It is time for us to accelerate our efforts\r\ntowards the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. I\r\nthus find it all the more deplorable that nuclear testing\r\ncontinues at this juncture. I strongly call for the\r\nimmediate cessation of nuclear testing. To this end, it is\r\nextremely important that a resolution calling for cessation\r\nbe adopted during this session of the General Assembly,\r\nwith the support of as many Member States as possible.\r\nI also believe that it is a most urgent task, as a major step\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\ntowards nuclear disarmament, to complete the negotiations\r\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty by next spring and to\r\nsign it by next autumn.\r\nIn our statement during the general debate we outlined\r\nJapan’s position on the reforms that are necessary if the\r\nUnited Nations is to be able to fulfil its mission.\r\nFirst, Japan, which has been playing a major role as\r\nthe second largest contributor, earnestly calls upon all\r\nMember States to face up to the financial crisis of the\r\nUnited Nations, to honour their financial obligations and to\r\nurgently and seriously address the question of United\r\nNations financial reform.\r\nSecondly, it is increasingly necessary to reform the\r\nUnited Nations system in the economic and social fields.\r\nImproving the efficiency and reviewing the mandates of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and other related organs are\r\npressing tasks. From this perspective, Japan will continue\r\nactively to participate in the discussions on an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment so that it can make its distinctive contribution.\r\nThirdly, with regard to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, its functions must be strengthened by enhancing its\r\neffectiveness and its legitimacy. This will necessitate an\r\nexpansion of the Council that includes an increase in its\r\npermanent membership and improvement in its working\r\nmethods, for example through enhanced transparency. I\r\nshould like to urge that Member States work expeditiously\r\nto reach an agreement on a broad framework of reform that\r\nincludes these elements by the time this General Assembly\r\nsession concludes next September.\r\nWe have only five years left to the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Humankind has reached the stage at which we\r\nshould all join hands and advance together so that the\r\ncoming century will be one of hope in which we can look\r\nforward to the creation and development of a new global\r\ncivilization. On this occasion, I should like to reaffirm the\r\ndetermination that the people of Japan made 50 years ago\r\nto live in peace, trusting in the justice and faith of the\r\npeace-loving peoples of the world.\r\nI should like to conclude my statement today with the\r\nassurance that, as the exploration of a new vision for the\r\nUnited Nations continues, Japan will attach ever-greater\r\nimportance to and enhance its support for the Organization.\r\nIn order to bring about world peace and eradicate poverty\r\nand inequality, Japan will do its utmost to contribute to the\r\ninternational community on the basis of the universal ideals\r\nof freedom and democracy.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of Japan\r\nfor his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tomiichi Murayama, Prime\r\nMinister of Japan, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jakob Kellenberger,\r\nSecretary of State of Switzerland\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/215 B, I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jakob Kellenberger, Secretary of State of\r\nSwitzerland.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jakob Kellenberger, Secretary of\r\nState of Switzerland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Kellenberger (interpretation from French): To\r\nthe United Nations, celebrating its fiftieth anniversary\r\ntoday, I have the honour of addressing the congratulations\r\nof the Swiss Government. Notwithstanding its observer\r\nstatus, Switzerland feels very directly involved in this\r\nevent. Fifty years ago, the founding Members of the\r\nUnited Nations decided to be the joint guarantors of\r\ninternational peace and security and to promote human\r\nrights and social and economic development in the world.\r\nIn the United Nations, we have today a sound tool for\r\nglobal policy-making that enables us, day by day and year\r\nby year, to build our future.\r\nThe expectations in this respect are as great as the\r\nmeans and the instruments are modest. In spite of all this,\r\nthe United Nations stands at the heart of the international\r\norder and will in the years ahead play a decisive role in\r\nthe establishment of a global system of human security.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, the United Nations\r\nhas been called upon as never before to play its role of\r\nguarding and promoting international peace and security.\r\nThis resurgence of activity has impelled the Organization\r\nto seek new ways of optimizing the implementation of the\r\nconcept of collective security and of further developing\r\nthe underlying philosophy of peace-keeping operations.\r\nTogether with protection for the weakest in the event\r\nof a disaster or conflict, respect for human rights has\r\nbecome one of the basic principles of the United Nations.\r\nIndeed, peace and security can be guaranteed within the\r\ncommunity of States only if citizens enjoy their\r\nfundamental rights and freedoms. This is possible only if\r\nthe law stands above political power. Thus, by means of\r\nnumerous treaties, covenants and conferences, the United\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nNations has moved the international community to make\r\nmajor strides in identifying shared priorities and principles.\r\nThe United Nations is deeply involved in managing\r\nthe socio-economic upheavals that characterize the end of\r\nthe twentieth century. The challenges affecting all mankind\r\nhave been or will be the focus of major United Nations\r\nconferences that will have to help us identify solutions in\r\na certain number of areas, all relating to global human\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe objectives of the United Nations converge with\r\nthe priorities of Switzerland’s foreign policy. An active\r\ncommitment to the promotion of international law in\r\ngeneral and to the peaceful settlement of disputes in\r\nparticular is a constant of that policy. The strengthening,\r\nimplementation and verification of norms relating to human\r\nrights, as well as the promotion of democracy and the\r\nconcept of a State based upon the rule of law, are all\r\npriority areas of Switzerland’s international commitment.\r\nIn the same vein, Switzerland has been supporting\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations to the extent of its\r\ncapabilities. Just like the United Nations, Switzerland\r\nrealizes that strengthened international cooperation is the\r\nonly way to meet the technological, economic, social and\r\nenvironmental challenges facing mankind as the third\r\nmillennium draws near. Switzerland will in future seek to\r\nenhance its cooperation with the United Nations and make\r\nevery effort to provide the Organization with the\r\nintellectual, operational and financial support one is entitled\r\nto expect from our country.\r\nThis convergence of views prompts the Swiss\r\nGovernment’s desire to pursue membership in the United\r\nNations as an objective of its foreign policy. Our\r\nGovernment is thus striving to maintain an ongoing\r\ndialogue with the Swiss people to enable them to become\r\naware of the changing face of international cooperation and\r\nof United Nations activities.\r\nIn Geneva, Switzerland is the host country to the\r\nUnited Nations and numerous other intergovernmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations. Switzerland deems the\r\npresence on its soil of international organizations to be\r\nhighly important and is determined to spare no effort to\r\nensure that Geneva remains a special venue for\r\ninternational organizations and conferences. To this end, it\r\nwill endeavour to contribute to enhancing the working\r\nconditions of the bodies of the United Nations and of the\r\nother international organizations established in Geneva.\r\nOn the occasion of these fiftieth anniversary\r\nfestivities, Switzerland wishes not only to extend to the\r\nUnited Nations its warmest congratulations, but also to\r\nthank the Organization for having created the conditions\r\nfor constructive international cooperation. The future that\r\nthe Swiss Government hopes to share with the United\r\nNations cannot but be built on intensive and fruitful\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary State of\r\nSwitzerland for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jakob Kellenberger, Secretary of\r\nState of Switzerland, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Yasser Arafat,\r\nChairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of\r\nthe Executive Committee of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Arafat (interpretation from Arabic): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure, Sir, on behalf of the Palestinian people and\r\nits leadership in the Palestine Liberation Organization and\r\nthe Palestinian National Authority, to express to you and\r\nto your friendly country our congratulations as you\r\npreside over this historic meeting, which crowns 50 years\r\nof international action.\r\nI also wish to salute the Kings, Presidents and Heads\r\nof delegations of the countries participating in this\r\nmeeting. I also salute Mr. Boutros-Ghali for his principled\r\npositions and tireless efforts. I salute the United Nations.\r\nOur meeting today affords us an important\r\nopportunity to take stock of the United Nations\r\nexperience and to reaffirm our commitment to its Charter\r\nfor a world of peace and security and a better future for\r\nmankind.\r\nThe history of the United Nations is intertwined with\r\nthat of the question of Palestine. It was the United\r\nNations that adopted the resolution on the partition of\r\nPalestine into two States: one Jewish and one Arab. Since\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nthen, the United Nations has not ceased to deal with the\r\nquestion of Palestine in all its ramifications and\r\ndevelopments.\r\nThe history of the United Nations and its resolutions\r\nconstitute an expression of its permanent legal, political and\r\nmoral responsibility, which makes the United Nations a\r\nwitness to the immense suffering of our people and their\r\nsacrifices, their displacement and scattering to all parts of\r\nthe world, as well as the wars and massacres which have\r\nbeen inflicted upon them. Nevertheless, they persisted in\r\ntheir struggle and their intifadah for survival and for the\r\naffirmation of their national identity.\r\nHence the importance of the United Nations\r\ncontinuing role. It should continue to sponsor our\r\nPalestinian cause, alongside the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nagreements, until the implementation of our inalienable\r\nnational rights, including the right of our people to return,\r\nself-determination and national independence.\r\nThe initiative of President Bush for the peace process\r\nand the Madrid Conference, and later the meetings in\r\nWashington, was made on the basis of United Nations\r\nresolutions, and the Palestinian-Israeli agreements in Oslo,\r\nCairo, Taba, Washington and others, were based on United\r\nNations resolutions, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well as on the\r\nprinciple of land-for-peace.\r\nThis means that the United Nations has an abiding\r\nresponsibility towards the cause of our people, particularly\r\nbecause such fundamental issues as the questions of Al-\r\nQuds, of refugees, of the settlements and of the final\r\nborders, have been left to the final stage.\r\nOur people have continued to affirm their support for\r\nthe peace process. When we embarked upon the peace\r\nprocess, which was approved by our National Council,\r\nCentral Council and all other organizational units, the peace\r\noption became an irreversible Palestinian decision. It\r\nsprings from our people’s desire to turn over the leaf of\r\nkilling and destruction once and for all, so that the\r\nPalestinian people and the Israeli people may live side by\r\nside, in two independent States on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect.\r\nThis historic Palestinian-Israeli reconciliation must be\r\ncarried through as envisaged. It must be completed on all\r\nthe other Arab-Israeli tracks, particularly the Lebanese and\r\nSyrian tracks, so that peace may be just and comprehensive\r\nand include also the Iraqi and the Libyan peoples.\r\nIn spite of all the difficulties we are determined to\r\npress forward to complete the transitional stage and enter\r\ninto negotiations on the final status. I should like to seize\r\nthis opportunity to express our appreciation to the\r\nsponsors of the peace process, the United States and the\r\nRussian Federation, especially for the support of President\r\nClinton and his good efforts and that of his assistants, and\r\nfor the efforts of President Yeltsin. I should also like to\r\nexpress appreciation for the efforts made by President\r\nMubarak of Egypt, in particular to give the process a\r\npush forward, and the efforts of Their Majesties King\r\nFahd, King Hassan II and King Hussein, as well as those\r\nof President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, President Zeroual\r\nand President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, the member States of\r\nthe European Union and Japan and the efforts of Mr.\r\nBoutros-Ghali, Norway and the Arab, Islamic, African\r\nand Non-Aligned States.\r\nWe emphasize our need for their support in order for\r\nour people to succeed in its endeavour, to rebuild its\r\ninfrastructure which has been destroyed by the\r\noccupation, to end its dispersal and to build its political\r\nsystem on the foundations of democratic pluralism and\r\nfreedom.\r\nThe winds of change are blowing in our world. A\r\nnew world order is emerging. It is our responsibility in\r\nthe United Nations and in the international community to\r\nmake it a good order for the stability, security and peace\r\nof the world, with the wider participation of the States\r\nand peoples of the world. We therefore support the trend\r\ntowards the expansion of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, which will give it new vigour and will ensure\r\njustice and equality for all.\r\nI came to this Assembly 21 years ago as a fighter\r\nfor freedom, liberation and independence, carrying with\r\nme the torments of my struggling people. Today,\r\nhowever, I come to you with a heart filled with love and\r\npeace, now that the olive branch has been raised over the\r\npeace of the brave.\r\nOur people yearns for peace. The prophecy of good\r\ntidings has been heralded. Help us bring it to fulfilment,\r\nhelp us bring it to fulfilment.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization for his statement.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: Before adjourning the meeting, I\r\nshould like to inform Your Excellencies that, owing to the\r\nlateness of the hour, it will not be possible to hear all the\r\nspeakers scheduled for the meeting this morning. The\r\nremaining speakers will therefore be moved to this\r\nafternoon’s meeting at 3 p.m. as first speakers in their\r\nrespective categories.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
