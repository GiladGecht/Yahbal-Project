(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 29 (continued)\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations\r\nThe President: This afternoon, we hold the second\r\nmeeting of the Special Commemorative Meeting on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mário Soares, President\r\nof the Portuguese Republic.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Mário Soares, President of\r\nthe Portuguese Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mário Soares, President of the\r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Soares (spoke in Portuguese; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): It is an honour to take part in\r\nthis historic session presided over by my illustrious\r\ncompatriot, Diogo Freitas do Amaral. I wish to reiterate to\r\nhim, here, the high regard and esteem in which I hold him.\r\nI wish also to extend warm greetings to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros-Ghali, whose thinking and efforts on\r\nbehalf of the restructuring of the United Nations have\r\nearned my full support. This session constitutes a unique\r\nopportunity to assess the work of the United Nations. But\r\nwe should also take advantage of this occasion to debate\r\nthe future. This is a good opportunity to consolidate that\r\nwhich should be consolidated and to reform that which\r\nshould be reformed.\r\nTribute must be paid to the United Nations for its\r\nsteadfast efforts in the furtherance of peace, dialogue and\r\ndevelopment. The difficulties and frustrations encountered\r\nhave been, for the most part, the responsibility of the\r\nMember States. At other times, they stem from a serious\r\nlack of finances. Such difficulties can be overcome only\r\nif States — both large and small — recognize that the\r\nworld has changed, that the will of peoples and\r\ninternational public opinion count today. The strength of\r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations represents a powerful stimulus in favour of\r\ndemocracy, human rights and peace. Outstanding\r\nexamples of this are the decolonization movement, in\r\nwhich a democratic Portugal participated actively, and,\r\nsubsequently, the struggle to abolish apartheid.\r\nFor that reason, allow me to refer to the outrageous\r\nsituation that continues to prevail in the Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territory of East Timor, which still awaits the\r\nconclusion of a decolonization process brutally interrupted\r\nby 20 years of occupation by Indonesia.\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nIn a rapidly changing world, in the face of unstoppable\r\nprocesses of globalization, the United Nations must do\r\neverything it can to ensure that changes occur without\r\nserious disruptions and in the service of all mankind, as\r\ncalled for in the recent appeal of the Copenhagen\r\nConference.\r\nWe must, however, have the courage to recognize that\r\nthe gap that separates the poor countries from the wealthy\r\nis growing ever wider and is becoming truly explosive.\r\nIn the communications society in which we live, it has\r\nbecome clear that all the world’s peoples aspire to take part\r\nin solving the overall problems of mankind. Everything\r\naffects everyone. And such participation today also means\r\nthe sharing of scientific knowledge, technology and\r\ninformation. These ongoing changes call for a global\r\nstrategy which obviously requires the restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nWill we be capable of ensuring peace, our most\r\nprecious asset? Of imposing the rule of law? Of putting an\r\nend to poverty, underdevelopment, fanaticism and\r\nignorance?\r\nThe key concept for a new approach is prevention.\r\nThe current system’s inability to respond, in physical,\r\nmaterial and financial terms, in a timely and effective\r\nmanner to the need for intervention in conflicts has made\r\nit especially clear in the last few years that the best strategy\r\nand, in the final analysis, oddly enough, the one that entails\r\nthe lesser financial burden is the prevention of crises and\r\nconflicts. This calls to mind the following phrase used by\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO):\r\n“since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\r\nconstructed”.\r\nIt is therefore essential to take action everywhere to\r\npromote dialogue and tolerance, instituting, as Mr. Federico\r\nMayor has said, a true “culture of peace”. Peace can be\r\nbuilt only by struggling against violence in all its forms —\r\nincluding in the mass media, by creating conditions of\r\ngreater equality among human beings, and by educating\r\npeople in the values of humanism, democracy and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nOne area in which the potential of the United Nations\r\nseems to me to be particularly encouraging is that of the\r\nworld’s oceans. Within the United Nations, it has been\r\npossible to establish a new international legal order for\r\nthe oceans, based on the principles of peaceful utilization,\r\ncooperation, and development of the capabilities of every\r\nnation.\r\nIt is my intention to foster the process of\r\ninternational study of the opportunities and challenges\r\nafforded by ocean exploration, with a view to the\r\nimperative need to preserve and protect them. This plan\r\nis naturally of special significance to a maritime nation\r\nlike Portugal and is consistent with the recent United\r\nNations initiative to proclaim 1998 as the “International\r\nYear of the Oceans”. That is also the year in which an\r\ninternational exhibition is to be held in Lisbon devoted to\r\nthe theme “The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future”.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations is an opportunity to think about what the\r\nfuture should be. We must do so optimistically, assuming\r\nour responsibilities towards future generations and passing\r\nthis on to our youth. This optimism must be built on a\r\nrealistic basis, in a spirit of solidarity. It is incumbent on\r\neach and every one of us, as human beings, at this dawn\r\nof a new millennium, to commit ourselves, boldly and\r\ncreatively, to building a different future for humanity, a\r\nfuture free of wars, with a sense of sharing in a common\r\nventure and a common destiny, in this home, which is\r\ncommon to us all and which we must preserve — the\r\nplanet Earth.\r\nThe President thanked the President of the\r\nPortuguese Republic for his statement; Mr. Soares,\r\nPresident of the Portuguese Republic, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Liamine Zeroual,\r\nPresident of the People’s Democratic Republic of\r\nAlgeria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Liamine Zeroual, President\r\nof the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Liamine Zeroual, President of\r\nthe People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Zeroual (Algeria) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): In the history of mankind and mankind’s\r\nprogress towards the attainment of its ideals, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations represents an ideal\r\nmoment for us to engage in collective introspection and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nto prepare conditions favourable to a new point of departure\r\nfor our Organization — collective introspection which\r\nshould enable us to take stock of the state of affairs in our\r\ncommon planetary home and a new point of departure\r\nwhich we should make possible through a healthy\r\nrehabilitation of the values and ideals upon which the\r\nUnited Nations was founded.\r\nThrough this commemoration, it is those values and\r\nideals which are favourable to the aspirations of all peoples\r\nafter peace, security and shared prosperity that we are\r\ncelebrating and we do so with all the more faith even if the\r\nhopes embodied in the United Nations have been frustrated\r\nand the Organization’s work remains incomplete.\r\nThe fact that the United Nations has seen its\r\nmembership approach universality in its 50 years of\r\nexistence bears witness to the existence of a fortunate\r\nconvergence between the trail that was blazed by the\r\nCharter and the course that has been followed by many of\r\nour peoples. The fact that the United Nations was able to\r\nfoster the vast liberation movement that delivered peoples\r\nfrom the yoke of colonial domination, holds its rightful\r\nplace among the causes of satisfaction that give today’s\r\nevent its full meaning.\r\nSimilarly, the United Nations has woven the fabric of\r\ncooperation amongst States — a cooperation which has\r\nmade it possible to spread the benefits of the mastery that\r\nmankind has achieved over nature in various spheres of life.\r\nIn this regard, my country welcomes the important and\r\neffective action by numerous organs of the United Nations\r\nsystem which have rendered invaluable services, especially\r\nto the developing world, thus fuelling our hopes for ever-\r\ngreater achievements that would be more widely shared.\r\nAt the same time, in the course of these past 50 years,\r\nthe United Nations has been the mirror that faithfully\r\nreflected the contradictions, trials and conflicts which have\r\nfilled so many pages in mankind’s tormented history.\r\nInstead of becoming the centre for harmonizing the actions\r\nof nations in the attainment of common ends as envisaged\r\nin the Charter, the United Nations became a closed arena\r\nwhere power politics were deployed in the pursuit of\r\nexclusive and narrow interests in a climate of confrontation.\r\nHowever, let us be fair to our Organization and let us\r\nrecognize that the weaknesses and shortcomings of the\r\nwork of the United Nations could not be viewed in isolation\r\nfrom the limits that Member States have imposed upon\r\ntheir cooperation, in particular with respect to\r\ninternational peace, security and development.\r\nThe end of the cold war has released vast energies\r\nand has lowered the barriers that prevented the United\r\nNations from realizing its full potential. Accordingly, the\r\nfiftieth anniversary, if the Organization is to prove equal\r\nto our legitimate aspirations and ambitions, should afford\r\nus an ideal opportunity to make a collective breakthrough\r\ntowards the realization of the promise of a more equitable\r\nand peaceful international society.\r\nThe United Nations has miraculously survived the\r\nperils that burdened the past 50 years of its life, perils\r\nthat impeded the discharge of its mission, weakened its\r\neffectiveness and, consequently, generated among our\r\npeoples, feelings of frustration that have been, at times,\r\nquite deep. Nevertheless the United Nations continued and\r\nwill continue to be the crucible of a great many\r\nexpectations and hopes.\r\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, the\r\npeoples of the United Nations, whose national systems are\r\nincreasingly converging towards pluralistic democracy,\r\nthe protection of all human rights and the promotion of a\r\nmarket economy, are entitled to redouble their\r\nexpectations with regard to the responsibilities the\r\nOrganization has to shoulder and what major objectives\r\nit should achieve.\r\nWhat is needed here is that the elimination of\r\ncolonialism should be fully completed. What is needed\r\nalso is that conflict situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nthe Middle East, the Western Sahara and in all other\r\nregions should be addressed and resolved in conformity\r\nwith justice and law. Also expected of the United Nations\r\nis to address the need to combat the scourge of terrorism\r\nwhich is a new form of destabilization of States and an\r\ninfringement of international security. That scourge should\r\nbe combated resolutely through a renewed international\r\ncooperation.\r\nThere is also the process of nuclear disarmament\r\nwhich needs to be expanded and stepped up. The\r\nenvironment needs to be protected in the face of new\r\ndangers that threaten man and his world.\r\nFinally, there is the need to consolidate the role of\r\nthe United Nations through the institution of reforms that\r\nwould make it the truly legitimate representative and\r\nefficient instrument which the convergence and cohesion\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nof the political will of Member States will enable to face up\r\nto the major challenges of our day.\r\nThese are the focal points of the work that lies before\r\nmankind on this solemn occasion of celebrating the passage\r\nof 50 years since the United Nations was founded.\r\nAlgeria, which is resolved to shoulder all its regional\r\nand international responsibilities, will always be an active\r\nand committed partner in all sincere efforts aimed at\r\nguaranteeing future generations the benefit of all the values\r\nand ideals of the United Nations, values and ideals that will\r\nlead to an advanced, prosperous, just, harmonious and\r\npeaceful international society.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic of Algeria for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Liamine Zeroual, President of the\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Kazakstan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Kazakstan.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, President of\r\nthe Republic of Kazakstan, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Nazarbaev (interpretation from Russian):\r\nIt is a great honour for me to represent the Republic of\r\nKazakstan at this historic meeting. Allow me to\r\ncongratulate all those present on this truly remarkable\r\noccasion, the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nWe are living in a dynamically changing world.\r\nToday’s international structures do not always effectively\r\nrespond to new realities. This is only natural.\r\nThe World War that began in 1914 brought about the\r\nLeague of Nations. The Second World War gave birth to\r\nthe United Nations. The collapse of the bipolar world and\r\nthe new geopolitical and economic realities demand the\r\nrenewal of international bodies. History itself teaches us\r\nthis.\r\nCould anyone involved in the elaboration of the\r\nVersailles security system have foreseen that in 20 years’\r\ntime there would be the biggest bloodletting in the history\r\nof humanity? The result was the collapse of the first\r\nstructure for world cooperation.\r\nWho at the time of the creation of the United\r\nNations could have foreseen a prolonged cold war\r\nbetween the two world systems, resulting in an\r\nunexpected collapse of one of them? Could anyone have\r\nimagined 10 years ago that one of the leaders of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement and a prosperous State of Europe —\r\nI am referring to Yugoslavia — would soon be torn apart\r\nand would sink in the blood of innocent people?\r\nToday, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, we stand at the threshold of a new era in\r\nthe development of global structures.\r\nNo international structure on the eve of twenty-first\r\ncentury will be capable of effectively resolving the issues\r\nof global security and social and political development\r\nwithout taking into consideration the new global balances,\r\nwhich are already being reflected today in the emergence\r\nof new centres of power in Western Europe, South-East\r\nAsia and North America. I stated Kazakstan’s view on\r\nthis issue at the United Nations Conference on\r\nDisarmament in Geneva last June.\r\nToday we should be grateful to the United Nations\r\nfor its effective endeavours, which have helped us all to\r\navert potential global disasters in the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century. This is an undoubted accomplishment\r\nof the United Nations and its principal bodies and\r\nstructures.\r\nThis will enable us immediately after the General\r\nAssembly Special Commemorative Meeting to concentrate\r\nour efforts on the elaboration of a conceptual model of a\r\nrenewed United Nations. Such a model should incorporate\r\nnot only the basic principles for reforming the United\r\nNations, but new goals, objectives and functions for the\r\nUnited Nations of the twenty-first century as well.\r\nI believe that the United Nations goals and purposes\r\nare clear for everyone. They are peace, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, human security and genuine democratization\r\nof the highest international bodies to create a united\r\nfamily of peoples and nations. In this context, I should\r\nlike to elaborate on a few specific aspects.\r\nFirst, the role of the Security Council in the\r\nresolution of the global issues of our day should be\r\nreinforced. To this end, first of all Germany and Japan\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nshould become full members of the Security Council. At\r\nthe same time, steps should be taken so that the views of\r\nthe States of all regions receive wider consideration in that\r\nbody.\r\nSecondly, the interaction of global and regional\r\nsecurity systems should be enhanced. Today we should take\r\ninto account that international security systems can be built\r\nnot only from the top, but also from the bottom, at the\r\nregional level.\r\nIn Central Asia we keenly feel the need to enhance\r\nthis regional aspect. That concern lies behind Kazakstan’s\r\ninitiatives concerning the Conference on Interaction and\r\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia and Eurasian union\r\nand our active cooperation within the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization. Moreover, the contours of the\r\nbiggest regional market are taking shape today in Central\r\nAsia, where many Asian, Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates and European countries could participate. In addition\r\nto this, many issues for the development of the region have\r\nglobal importance.\r\nThis pertains first of all to the issue of the effective\r\ntransportation of oil and gas resources of the region, to\r\nmeet the needs of the development of the world economy\r\nin the twenty-first century, as well as to the efforts to\r\ncombat the transit of drugs and to the cooperative efforts of\r\nthe world community to preserve the Aral Sea. Unless\r\nurgent steps are taken, the environmental consequences of\r\nthe Aral disaster can easily become an issue of great\r\nconcern for Eurasia as a whole.\r\nHence, we must face the most important question: how\r\nthe renewed United Nations is to interact with the regional\r\nand continental system of security and cooperation? There\r\nare two different roles that the United Nations may play.\r\nThe first is the role of a single centre of global security,\r\nwhose decisions are strictly binding for all regional\r\nsystems. The shortcoming of such a centre is that the\r\nUnited Nations can unwittingly take the side of one of the\r\nparties in a conflict, thus hindering the natural evolution of\r\nother growing centres of power in the world.\r\nA second option is the role of an international\r\ncoordinating body, which would act as the highest\r\nindependent arbitrator in resolving disputes and clashes\r\nbetween regional structures. The shortcoming here is that it\r\nmay not be in a position to take timely and effective\r\ndecisions and prevent a conflict.\r\nThirdly, similar problems will arise, not only in\r\nmilitary and strategic areas but in all areas of human\r\nactivity — culture, information, science and technology,\r\nfinance and the economy. This brings us to a question:\r\nWhat should the United Nations be in the twenty-first\r\ncentury? Shall it be a supreme body taking decisions\r\nbinding upon all nations and international bodies, or shall\r\nit be a single, global coordinating tool, a structure for\r\nbalanced cooperation, mediation and supreme arbitration?\r\nWe should begin as of today to focus the best minds\r\nof the world on the resolution of these issues. But, in so\r\ndoing, we should avoid irresponsible actions towards the\r\nUnited Nations, as they can unbalance the established\r\nsystem of international relations. Therefore, the selection\r\nof a new United Nations model should be well thought\r\nthrough and be a clear expression of the will of all\r\nnations of the world.\r\nFinally, if we want the United Nations significantly\r\nto minimize the potential for global conflict by the end of\r\nthis century and increase the chances for peace and\r\ndevelopment, all we can do is to ensure that each and\r\nevery one of us willingly contributes his best efforts to\r\nthe noble task of United Nations reforms. If we manage\r\nto address these issues in 1995, then we could consider at\r\nsome future session of the General Assembly a special\r\nagenda item entitled “The United Nations reforms — an\r\nadequate response to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury”.\r\nThe first issue we will then have to face will be how\r\nto finance these changes. Three years ago, at the forty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly, I made a\r\nrelatively simple and radical proposal to resolve this\r\nissue, namely, to set up a fund for peace-keeping efforts\r\nwith each nation contributing to it by reducing its defence\r\nbudget by 1 per cent annually. This proposal is still valid.\r\nOne last thing: Kazakstan fully shares the goals and\r\nproposals in the statement by the President of the United\r\nStates, William Clinton, for his initiatives coincide with\r\nour policy, which is geared towards decisively fighting\r\nsuch present-day scourges as corruption, organized crime\r\nand the spread of drugs and terrorism.\r\nI sincerely wish all of us and those who come after\r\nus every success in building the United Nations as a\r\nunited family of peoples and nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Kazakstan for his statement.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, President of\r\nthe Republic of Kazakstan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Heydar Alirza ogly\r\nAliyev, President of the Azerbaijani Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Heydar Alirza ogly Aliyev,\r\nPresident of the Azerbaijani Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Heydar Alirza ogly Aliyev,\r\nPresident of the Azerbaijani Republic, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Aliyev (interpretation from Russian): On\r\nbehalf of the people of Azerbaijan and on my own personal\r\nbehalf I extend heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, which has\r\nmade a great contribution to strengthening peace, security\r\nand stability in our world.\r\nGreat positive changes have occurred during the 50\r\nyears since the establishment of the United Nations,\r\ninvolving the complete rebuilding of the world and the\r\npractical implementation of the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe main point here is that irrespective of the sharp\r\nconfrontation during the cold war it was possible to avoid\r\na new world war. Colonialism, apartheid and racial\r\ndiscrimination have become history. People have won the\r\nchance to master their destiny and have obtained national\r\nfreedom and independence. The proclamation of\r\nindependence and sovereignty by the republics of the\r\nformer Soviet Union was a historic event. Confirmation of\r\ncommon human values, particularly the ideas of freedom,\r\ndemocracy and human rights, has become widely expanded.\r\nThoroughgoing democratic changes in State structures, in\r\nthe economy and in all areas of life have become extremely\r\nimportant factors for many countries.\r\nEach Member State of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular the big Powers with developed economies and\r\ndemocratic traditions, has made a contribution to\r\nstrengthening peace and security and the attainment of these\r\nresults. But the United Nations, which has grown over the\r\npast 50 years into the most authoritative and influential\r\ninternational organization in the history of mankind, has\r\nplayed a special role. I believe that the financial difficulties\r\nfacing the Organization will be overcome and that it will\r\nhave success in its work in the future.\r\nIt is gratifying to us to take note of this and it fills\r\nus with admiration, but peace in the world has not\r\nbecome more secure, perfect or ideal. Problems involving\r\nthe violation of the norms of international law in inter-\r\nState relations, international terrorism, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, the elimination of hunger\r\nand poverty, and the prevention of environmental disasters\r\nall require a radical solution. The appearance of\r\naggressive nationalism and separatism in various regions\r\nof the world, which lead to bloody conflicts and to untold\r\nsuffering for millions of people, remain threats to the\r\npeace.\r\nFor more than seven years now the aggression of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia against Azerbaijan has been going\r\non, with the aim of annexing the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nregion of our country. Armed formations belonging to\r\nArmenia have occupied more than 20 per cent of the\r\nterritory of Azerbaijan. More than 1 million citizens of\r\nour country, who are now refugees, have been evicted\r\nfrom the occupied territories and are now living in tent\r\ncamps in the most difficult circumstances. The Security\r\nCouncil of the United Nations has adopted four\r\nresolutions demanding the unconditional withdrawal of\r\nArmenian armed formations from the occupied territories\r\nof Azerbaijan. However, these resolutions are not being\r\nimplemented by the aggressor and therefore the peace\r\nprocess within the Minsk Group of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has so far\r\nnot yielded the desired results.\r\nI appeal to the distinguished Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, to the United Nations, and to the OSCE to\r\nrender effective assistance to achieve a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, the\r\nrestoration of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the\r\ninviolability of its internationally recognized borders.\r\nIn expressing the will of the people of Azerbaijan,\r\nI declare that we condemn all kinds of aggression in any\r\npart of the world. We want peace: peace in the whole\r\nworld, peace in our region, and peace and good-\r\nneighbourly relations with all States. It is with this hope\r\nand belief that I leave this distinguished rostrum.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nAzerbaijani Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Heydar Alirza ogly Aliyev,\r\nPresident of the Azerbaijani Republic, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos\r\nSantos, President of the Republic of Angola\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Santos (spoke in Portuguese; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): To all those present I should\r\nlike to address, on my own behalf and on behalf of all the\r\nAngolan people that I have the honour to represent here,\r\nmy warmest salutations to the United Nations.\r\nThe journey has not been easy for our Organization.\r\nOn the date of its foundation the world was just emerging\r\nfrom a devastating war in which about 50 countries were\r\ninvolved, with a tragic balance of 50 million dead and\r\nprofound trauma and destruction.\r\nThe almost immediate bipolarization of the planet\r\nbetween two antagonistic political and economic systems\r\ndid not contribute to the easy establishment of just\r\nprinciples in favour of international peace and security,\r\neven though the United Nations played a praiseworthy role\r\nin the liquidation of colonialism, the promotion of human\r\nrights and the rights of people, in encouraging development\r\nand international cooperation, and in the management and\r\ncontrol of small conflicts all over the world.\r\nHowever, the logic of the so-called cold war generated\r\na frantic race for armament. It is true that various attempts\r\nwere being made by the United Nations to promote global\r\ndisarmament and to restrict nuclear arsenals but they were\r\ninsufficient to dispel the threat that weighed on humanity.\r\nIn spite of the balance of terror between the countries\r\nholding nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction,\r\nwe think that the United Nations should maintain on its\r\nagenda the task of completely eliminating such weapons\r\nand promoting concrete action to that end.\r\nWith the fall of the Berlin Wall and the arrival of new\r\npolitical thinking in international relations, the United\r\nNations can resume its action directed towards the\r\nconstruction of a peaceful new world order.\r\nUnfortunately, the United Nations still has neither the\r\nunanimity of its Members nor sufficient means to\r\neffectively impose its legitimate will to sanction those\r\nwho disturb the peace and violate civil and democratic\r\norder, international laws and human rights. Meanwhile,\r\nthe political configuration of the contemporary world, in\r\nwhich local, regional and inter-State conflicts constitute\r\nthe main areas of international tension and threats to\r\npeace, demands that the United Nations assume an ever\r\nmore active role in the promotion and pursuance of\r\npolitical, economic, and social democratization processes.\r\nThis is the best way to solve ethnic or inter-State\r\nconflicts, which in most cases are caused by immediate\r\nsituations, actions of tyrannical Governments or exclusion\r\npolicies almost always associated with the phenomenon of\r\nMember States’ interference in the affairs of other States.\r\nThe promotion and safeguarding of human rights and\r\nthe solution of humanity’s global problems, such as those\r\nrelated to the environment, security and development,\r\nconstitute another priority for the United Nations. Material\r\nwealth and food reserves are concentrated in a few\r\ncountries of the North. Despite the potential of the South,\r\nthe scourge of hunger, endemic disease and the shortage\r\nof drinking water there affect more than two thirds of the\r\nworld’s population, a number that may increase a great\r\ndeal in the next century and may constitute one of the\r\ngreatest threats to peace and stability on the planet.\r\nThe proportions reached today by various\r\nmanifestations of extremism and exclusionary activities,\r\nsuch as terrorism, organized crime, separatism, racism,\r\nxenophobia and so on, and the issue of preserving the\r\nstandard of living on the planet negatively affect inter-\r\nState relations and call for solutions to be agreed upon by\r\nthe international community at the highest level.\r\nSooner or later, this will require the redefinition of\r\nUnited Nations structures and mechanisms of action,\r\nparticularly the Security Council, which should continue\r\nto be the main organ guaranteeing the preservation of\r\nworld peace. To that end, it needs to act on a more\r\ndemocratic basis by increasing the number of its\r\npermanent members.\r\nAngola considers it urgent, first, to assign a\r\npermanent seat in the Security Council to a country from\r\neach geographic region that, by its importance, can\r\nassume an effective role in the preservation of peace at\r\nthe regional level and, secondly, to create a body that\r\nmakes it possible for the various regional mechanisms to\r\nfunction in coordinated and complementary fashion in the\r\nsearch for rapid, effective and balanced solutions to\r\nlocalized conflicts and tensions.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nWith regard to international economic issues, I believe\r\nit is pertinent to say that the world financial system,\r\nestablished under the Bretton Woods institutions, is now\r\ninadequate for facing the realities of today’s international\r\neconomic crisis, which is characterized by a widening gap\r\nbetween rich and poor countries and a growing external\r\ndebt that virtually cancels out any real chances of\r\ndevelopment. Just as an authentic multipolarization of the\r\nworld is taking place in the political sphere, in the\r\neconomic sphere today’s reality should be faced through a\r\ndecentralization of the world financial system. This should\r\nbe based on both the promotion of commercial integration\r\nand regional economic systems and on the strengthening of\r\nregional financial institutions in a way that would really\r\nencourage self-sustained economic development.\r\nAngola takes a special interest in participating in this\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Our entire post-\r\nindependence history has been closely associated with this\r\ninternational Organization, with which we have always been\r\nready to cooperate in order to solve our problems and\r\npacify our region and from which we have always received\r\nclear signs of understanding and solidarity.\r\nIn particular, I am referring to the acts of aggression\r\nagainst and occupation of part of our territory by the\r\n“apartheid” army, condemned by the Security Council in its\r\nresolutions; the Namibian independence process; the\r\nimprovement made in the critical and complex situation in\r\nSouthern Africa through the conclusion and implementation\r\nof the New York Accord of December 1988; the resolution\r\nof Angola’s internal conflict on the basis of the Bicesse\r\nAccords and the Lusaka Protocol; humanitarian aid to\r\nrefugees and displaced persons; and the participation of the\r\nUnited Nations, since at least 1989, in Angola’s\r\nreconstruction efforts, of which the recent donor conference\r\nin Brussels is the best example.\r\nIn this context, the successive visits to Angola by\r\nthree Secretaries-General of the United Nations — His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kurt Waldheim, His Excellency Mr. Javier\r\nPérez de Cuéllar and His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali — deserve to be highlighted for their symbolic and\r\npractical significance. All of those visits contributed to\r\nadvancing efforts for pacification and democratization, not\r\nonly in Angola but in all of Southern Africa, thus creating\r\nample prospects of economic and social cooperation and\r\ndevelopment between the countries of the region.\r\nAt this very moment, thousands of United Nations\r\nsoldiers are deployed throughout Angolan territory as\r\nguarantors and monitors of the peace process. However, for\r\nthe mission to be accomplished successfully, it is urgent\r\nto accelerate the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol,\r\nespecially as regards the quartering and disarming of\r\nUNITA military forces, their integration into the Angolan\r\narmed forces and the de-mining and opening of the main\r\nroads for the free movement of people and goods. We\r\nhope that all of these tasks will be concluded by March\r\nnext year so that the Government of unity and national\r\nreconciliation can then be established, with cadres from\r\nUNITA integrated into it.\r\nI would like to avail myself of this rostrum to thank\r\nthe entire international community for its contribution to\r\nthe cause of peace and reconciliation in Angola and the\r\nmeans it recently made available to my country for its\r\neconomic restoration. I would like to appeal to those\r\npresent for continued financial, technical and material\r\nassistance in the economic recovery of Angola. With such\r\nsupport, the Angolan Government intends to consolidate\r\ninternal peace and become a credible partner of Your\r\nExcellencies’ Governments in the promotion of bilateral\r\nand multilateral trade and investment and in the\r\nconsolidation of world peace.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Angola for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. João Bernardo Vieira,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. João Bernardo Vieira,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President\r\nof the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Vieira (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): On 26 June 1945, 51 countries gathered in\r\nthe city of San Francisco for an international conference\r\nthat culminated in the historic decision creating the\r\nUnited Nations. Today, 22 October 1995, in the city of\r\nNew York, 185 States are gathered in this grand General\r\nAssembly Hall to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe entry into force of the Charter of our universal\r\nOrganization.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nOn this occasion I have the great honour and privilege\r\nof speaking, on behalf of my country, Guinea-Bissau, to\r\nthis gathering of illustrious representatives, at a time when\r\nthe new climate of international relations favours peace and\r\nunderstanding between peoples.\r\nThe League of Nations of 1925 and the United\r\nNations of 1945, both emerging from great wars that\r\nwounded mankind, were manifestations of a determination\r\nto create a framework for international agreement that\r\nwould foster dialogue and peace.\r\nThere can be no doubt that our century will go down\r\nin the history of mankind as the century of those two major\r\nwars, which took a toll of tens of millions of lives; but it\r\nwill also be remembered as the century of the cold war that\r\ndivided the world into two blocs for half a century and the\r\nre-emergence of extreme forms of nationalism, with tragic\r\nconsequences.\r\nThis period is also marked by major achievements and\r\ngreat strides by mankind in the fields of science and\r\ntechnology.\r\nOur century has seen a re-emergence in the awareness\r\nof Governments and citizens of fundamental values of the\r\nhuman person, including respect for the dignity of the\r\nhuman person, democracy and — above all — the right of\r\npeoples to self-determination, which has encouraged the\r\nprocess of decolonization and the eradication of apartheid.\r\nThe protection of the environment and the need to\r\npreserve the environment are also among our concerns at\r\nthis time.\r\nA new cultural relationship between man and nature\r\nhas been forged and rules of conduct aimed at preserving\r\nthe flora and fauna and biological diversity have been\r\ncodified. However, despite these major achievements, most\r\nof which are the work of our Organization, some critical\r\nproblems persist.\r\nThe precarious economic situation of third-world\r\ncountries, especially in Africa, aggravated by the extreme\r\npoverty of their populations, especially the most vulnerable,\r\nsuch as the elderly, women and children, is a serious threat\r\nto international peace and security.\r\nWe welcome the current process of disarmament,\r\nwhose aims are the reduction of the dangers of conflict and\r\ntension in the world.\r\nToday, more than ever, the United Nations Charter\r\nis a legal, political and moral frame of reference that\r\ncannot be side-stepped in international relations.\r\nGuinea-Bissau is convinced that it is imperative to\r\nproceed with the necessary reforms within our\r\nOrganization in order to better respond to the\r\nrequirements of contemporary international relations in\r\nthe light of recent developments, which have profound\r\npolitical, economic and social implications for many\r\ncountries.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome efforts aimed at\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly, rationalizing its agenda\r\nand expanding the Security Council by increasing the\r\nnumber of members on the basis of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\nIn the name of the principle of universality and\r\nparallel representation of divided countries, allow me to\r\nreaffirm on this historic occasion our fervent desire to see\r\nthe Republic of China in Taiwan join the United Nations.\r\nThe world today is facing a growing number of\r\ntensions and conflicts that threaten world stability and\r\ncompromise human progress. It is up to Member States to\r\nactively support actions aimed at strengthening the United\r\nNations capacity in the prevention of conflict and the\r\nmaintenance of peace.\r\nIn this respect, I would call for greater dialogue and\r\ncoordination of our efforts in order to forge a world\r\nOrganization capable of preserving future generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war and to give the poorest and most\r\nhelpless true reasons for hope, thus safeguarding the\r\ncommon interests of mankind.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Guinea-Bissau for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President\r\nof the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr\r\nLukashenka, President of the Republic of Belarus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Belarus.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, President\r\nof the Republic of Belarus, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Lukashenka (interpretation from Russian):\r\nI greet all those present on behalf of the Republic of\r\nBelarus, a State which, despite the fact that it became\r\nindependent only four years ago, was a founding member\r\nof the United Nations. The people of Belarus made a\r\nworthy contribution to the victory over fascism. Our\r\nRepublic was at the very centre of the world conflagration\r\nand lost more than a fourth of its population, but it did not\r\naccept fascist tyranny.\r\nThe idea of setting up the Organization, an\r\norganization capable of ensuring security for all peoples,\r\ncame to maturity in the crucible of the Second World War.\r\nAfter half a century now, we can say without any doubt\r\nthat the establishment of the United Nations was truly a\r\nhistoric decision. The prevention of nuclear catastrophe, the\r\ncollapse of the colonial system, the elimination of apartheid,\r\nthe unprecedented flights of human genius in science and\r\ntechnology — all of this was achieved, to a large extent,\r\nthanks to the Organization whose fiftieth anniversary we are\r\ncelebrating today.\r\nBut the United Nations would do well today to think\r\nnot so much about what has been done as about what still\r\nremains to be done. Unfortunately, on the threshold of the\r\nthird millennium, the world is still burdened by many\r\nproblems characteristic of the past: wars; armed conflicts in\r\nvarious regions; terrorism and other types of crime;\r\nenvironmental disasters; poverty; and hunger. Many other\r\nthings threaten the future of mankind.\r\nThe United Nations alone, this universal Organization,\r\nwhich reflects the interests of all peoples of the Earth, can\r\nunite the efforts of the community of nations in resolving\r\nthese problems. We cannot agree with those who cast doubt\r\non the role of the United Nations in the world of the future.\r\nGiving up the United Nations would be giving up the very\r\nidea of the solidarity of all peoples of Earth in the face of\r\nour common problems. If we allowed this to happen, it\r\nwould be a crime to those who 50 years ago overcame\r\nfascism and created this unique mechanism.\r\nI believe that the human mind has made so many\r\ndiscoveries that we need to make the United Nations more\r\neffective. We need to find the money for this, and this is\r\npossible. The Organization has shown that it was viable in\r\nthe conditions of the cold war and in bloc confrontation.\r\nNow it has to confirm the effectiveness of its actions in our\r\nmultipolar world. The main thing is to prevent a new rift\r\nin the world.\r\nIn view of this, we believe the expansion of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization is fraught with\r\nunforeseen consequences for the future of Europe.\r\nBelarus, which geographically is at the centre of our\r\ncontinent, has many times in our history been the first to\r\nsuffer from new confrontation. I am convinced that on the\r\nthreshold of the third millennium we should not think\r\nabout the expansion of military and political unions, the\r\nplacing of nuclear weapons or the expansion of military\r\narsenals. On the contrary, we should try to eliminate the\r\nvery possibility of wars arising and reduce or completely\r\ndestroy nuclear weapons.\r\nWe can speak here for all to hear because Belarus\r\nwas the first State in history that voluntarily and without\r\nany conditions renounced nuclear weapons. Unfortunately,\r\nwe found ourselves in a paradoxical situation when our\r\ncommitment to the ideas of disarmament created serious\r\neconomic difficulties for the country. We were compelled\r\nto divert resources intended for social programmes to\r\ndestroying weapons that had been accumulated on our\r\nterritory during the bloc confrontation. I am convinced\r\nthat for the leaders of the States that participated in the\r\ncold war a feeling of justice will prevail and they will\r\nhelp us to resolve this question.\r\nFirst and foremost, I would like to stress deepening\r\nsocio-economic problems in various regions, as well as\r\nthe division of the world into the poor and the rich\r\ncountries. The new independent States are now in the\r\nthroes of a very serious socio-economic crisis. The gap,\r\nwhich has been expanding for years now, has brought no\r\none any good.\r\nWe should not, therefore, be surprised at — still less\r\nshould we fear — the integration processes that are now\r\ngoing on. The growing closeness between fraternal\r\ncountries has the effect of uniting efforts to solve\r\ncommon problems, and it is not a threat to anyone’s\r\nsecurity or interests.\r\nI am convinced that our peoples will definitely\r\novercome their socio-economic difficulties. I am\r\nconvinced that the solution of the economic and social\r\nproblems of Belarus and other countries that used to be\r\npart of the Soviet Union will be in the interests of all\r\nUnited Nations Members. Peace and security on Earth are\r\nimpossible without economic well-being and social\r\nstability for the newly independent States.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nAnother problem — a growing problem and, quite\r\nliterally, a deadly threat to the security of our peoples — is\r\nthe worsening environmental situation in the world. The\r\npeople of Belarus have suffered most of all from the major\r\nenvironmental disaster of our time — the Chernobyl\r\naccident. More than 40 per cent of the radioactive particles\r\nfell on our territory, and the country was forced to divert\r\nmore than 20 per cent of its budget to deal with the\r\nconsequences of this disaster. I hope that the United\r\nNations will not abandon the peoples that suffered from the\r\nChernobyl disaster and leave them to deal with the tragedy\r\nthemselves.\r\nNew threats facing mankind in the late twentieth\r\ncentury cannot be dealt with by peoples unless they\r\nrenounce national egoism. The major States must think not\r\nabout diktat, not about subjugating peoples to their\r\ninfluence, but about leadership in the solution of problems\r\nfacing mankind. Although some people do not like to hear\r\nthis, the best instrument for coordinating the interests of all\r\npeoples is still the United Nations. My country will do\r\neverything in its power to make this Organization live up\r\nto the hopes placed in it by our peoples.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Belarus for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, President\r\nof the Republic of Belarus, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Stojan Andov, Acting\r\nPresident of the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Stojan Andov, Acting\r\nPresident of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Stojan Andov, Acting President of\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nActing President Andov (spoke in Macedonian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): My country’s\r\naddress to this eminent world gathering was to have been\r\ngiven by the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Kiro\r\nGligorov. He is unable to be here, for he is undergoing\r\nmedical treatment following the deplorable terrorist attack\r\non his life. Fortunately, the assassination attempt did not\r\nachieve its political aim: to destabilize the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, to change its democratic and peaceful course\r\nand its role as key component of peace in the southern\r\nBalkans. This policy will remain the permanent and\r\nstrategic orientation of the Republic of Macedonia.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity, on behalf on\r\nthe citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, to express\r\nsincere appreciation for the support and sympathy that\r\nrepresentatives from the United Nations and numerous\r\nHeads of State have conveyed to the Republic of\r\nMacedonia at this sensitive time.\r\nThe gains that have been made through the existence\r\nof the United Nations are major and significant indeed.\r\nThe Charter has survived the test of the past five decades\r\nand continues to be the basic framework on which world\r\npeace, security, cooperation and economic and social\r\ndevelopment can successfully be built.\r\nIn the past five decades the world has changed\r\nsubstantially. As a result — and quite rightly — we all\r\nface the issue of the need for reform of the Organization.\r\nThe reforms we envisage are, above all, aimed at\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the work done by the United\r\nNations and its bodies, strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in preserving world peace, enhancing\r\ncollective security and harmonizing global economic and\r\nsocial development and political cooperation.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia has shown itself to be\r\na key factor for peace in the southern Balkans. We have\r\nopted for a peaceful and legitimate course to achieve for\r\nthe Macedonian people the right to self-determination and\r\nindependence. We have opted for a peaceful approach and\r\nfor political negotiations for dissolution of the Socialist\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, and have refused to take\r\npart in the inter-ethnic war in its regions. We have opted\r\nfor refraining from the use of force to violate existing\r\nborders and have proclaimed independence within the\r\nconstitutional and internationally recognized borders. We\r\nhave also actively carried out the policy of good-\r\nneighbourliness and equidistance towards our neighbours\r\nand, thus, overcome the historic causes of what has been\r\na bone of contention. Last, but not least, we have opted\r\nfor speedy market reforms, democracy and the integration\r\nof European countries.\r\nThis domestic state and international orientation of\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia and its key role with regard to\r\npeace in the southern Balkans was supported by the\r\nUnited Nations through the deployment of forces of the\r\nUnited Nations Preventive Deployment Force in the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia. This helped to prevent an\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nescalation of the war to the south of the Balkans and gave\r\na clear signal that the independence and territorial integrity\r\nof the Republic of Macedonia are also a matter of concrete\r\ninterest to the United Nations. In addition, under the aegis\r\nof the United Nations a start was made in normalization of\r\nrelations between the Republic of Macedonia and the\r\nRepublic of Greece.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia remains ready to take a\r\nfull and active part in and to contribute fully and actively\r\nto the United Nations in the hope that, on the basis of the\r\nCharter, we shall finally secure the right to have the\r\nOrganization refer to us by our constitutional name — the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia — and that we shall receive active\r\nsupport in surmounting the damage caused by sanctions and\r\nblockades.\r\nThe President: I thank the Acting President of the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Stojan Andov, Acting President of\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Michal Kováč, President\r\nof the Slovak Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Michal Kováč, President of\r\nthe Slovak Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Michael Kováč, President of the\r\nSlovak Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Kováč (spoke in Slovak; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): It is my great pleasure to\r\naddress this most distinguished assembly of representatives\r\nof the States Members of the United Nations, as well as\r\nleading representatives of this world Organization. I am\r\nconvinced that the festive moments we are now sharing\r\nduring the fiftieth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly will mark the beginning of a new era in our\r\npurposeful and responsible approach to the future evolution\r\nof the international community.\r\nSlovakia is one of the youngest Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. At the same time, as a part of the former\r\nCzechoslovakia, it shares the traditions as one of the\r\nfounders of the United Nations. For our country, the United\r\nNations is the most important world organization and has\r\nbeen playing an irreplaceable role in international relations\r\nfor half a century. We are proud that Slovak diplomats\r\nwere present at its founding. Indeed, one of them was the\r\nvery first Legal Counsel of the United Nations, with the\r\nrank of Assistant Secretary-General — a distinguished\r\nSlovak jurist and diplomat, Mr. Ivan Kerno.\r\nThe United Nations was established after a failed\r\nattempt to gain absolute world hegemony and in the\r\neuphoric atmosphere of the victory over that attempt. It\r\nwas founded in order to prevent a recurrence of that\r\ncatastrophe and to save future generations from the\r\nsuffering and horrors of war. The Slovak Republic highly\r\nappreciates both current and past endeavours of the\r\nUnited Nations in the field of international relations.\r\nThe United Nations is a living organism; it enjoys\r\nperiods of success but is aware of its weaknesses as well.\r\nOn the one hand, we can appreciate the past and present\r\nrole of the Organization in resolving issues related to\r\npeace and security. On the other hand, social issues, as\r\nwell as the process of strengthening democracy and\r\nprotecting human rights, will require a more sensitive and,\r\nabove all, a more effective approach in the future. We are\r\ncurrently witnessing growth in the United Nations role in\r\nthe field of economic and social development, where a\r\ncertain disproportion exists. The international community\r\ncannot afford, in its own interests, not to address this\r\ndisproportion.\r\nThe current trend clearly reveals its common\r\ndenominators to be interdependence and\r\ninterconnectedness. The United Nations faces an uneasy\r\nbut unavoidable task. This task requires it to resolve\r\nproblems connected with changes in its institutional\r\nstructure and administrative and legal mechanisms and,\r\nlast but not least, connected with the adoption of\r\nmeasures that can lead to the more efficient functioning\r\nof the whole system and its invigoration by outstanding\r\nhuman potential. The United Nations can only change in\r\nline with the wishes and desires of its Members. If we\r\nwant these structural changes to have a positive impact on\r\nthe international situation, the political will and agreement\r\nof our individual Governments are of vital importance.\r\nThe United Nations has a relatively short but very\r\ndynamic history. Even during its brief existence it has\r\nmade many demonstrable contributions to the well-being\r\nof mankind. However, voices can be heard today\r\nexpressing pessimism about the future of our\r\nOrganization. We prefer to believe that this Organization\r\nis ensuring its continued viability through its actions. Let\r\nme refer to a Slovak proverb:\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\n“If you do nothing you cannot make a mistake.”\r\nIn this respect, the willingness and ability of the United\r\nNations to assume and continue to accept its burden of\r\ngreat responsibility deserve our highest appreciation and,\r\nespecially, our ongoing willingness to participate in the\r\nfulfilment of the new and more demanding tasks before the\r\nOrganization.\r\nSlovakia is aware of its obligations towards the United\r\nNations. Our new State has successfully taken part in many\r\nUnited Nations activities. Let me mention only one: our\r\nparticipation in peace-keeping and humanitarian operations.\r\nI wish to assure Members that my country will continue to\r\nact in conformity with its international obligations and in\r\nthe general spirit of cooperation between States in the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAllow me finally to express my sincere conviction that\r\nthe United Nations, as it meets to sum up its achievements\r\non the occasion of its golden jubilee, is fully equipped to\r\nfind non-schematic and constructive solutions to even the\r\nmost intricate current and future problems. Our conviction\r\nis strengthened as cooperation between us, as individual\r\nmembers of the international community, grows deeper and\r\nstronger. I would like to assure the Assembly that Slovakia\r\nwishes to be and will be a solid and reliable partner in this\r\nprocess.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Slovak\r\nRepublic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Michal Kováč, President of the\r\nSlovak Republic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Amata Kabua, President\r\nof the Republic of the Marshall Islands\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Amata Kabua, President of\r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amata Kabua, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Kabua: I bring warm greetings from the\r\npeople of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I extend to\r\nyou, Mr. President, and to the Secretary-General, on behalf\r\nof the people of the Marshall Islands, our warmest\r\ncongratulations on your leadership.\r\nLet us recognize on this historic occasion the\r\ncontribution of the founding fathers and framers of the\r\nUnited Nations and its Charter. Their vision has\r\ncontributed to an ever-increasing consciousness of the\r\nprerequisites to world peace.\r\nToday is an occasion to celebrate half a century of\r\nthe existence of the United Nations and its\r\naccomplishments, and also to reflect over how,\r\ncollectively, we may better chart our path and more\r\nclearly articulate our goals for the next 50 years or so.\r\nThere is today growing evidence of the human\r\ncapacity for wider affection and loyalty, as demonstrated\r\nby increasing interdependence and integration. Yet the\r\nfomentation of conflicts and persecution continues to\r\nthrive unabated. An entrenched mind-set continues to\r\nplace ethnicity and the nation-State above all else,\r\nfrustrating the realization of the vision enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe current political landscape is now vastly\r\ndifferent from that of 50 years ago. This requires the\r\nUnited Nations critically to examine its performance and\r\nstructures in search of practical solutions. It is imperative,\r\ntherefore, that those elements which are antiquated and no\r\nlonger minister to the needs of a continually changing\r\nhumanity be swept away and relegated to the currents of\r\nhistory.\r\nFundamental principles governing the operation of\r\nthe essential organs of the United Nations, such as the\r\nSecurity Council, should be given particular attention; so,\r\ntoo, must the International Court of Justice and the\r\nconditions which continue to restrain its effectiveness. No\r\nless important are the perennial financial constraints and\r\nconditions hampering the work of the United Nations.\r\nThis session will witness the sharing of many\r\nconstructive and far-sighted recommendations. I propose\r\nthe holding of an international convocation before the turn\r\nof the century. With firm resolve and clear vision, we\r\nmust endeavour to make the cause of peace the object of\r\nour consultations and seek by every means in our power\r\nto establish the unity of all the nations. These\r\nconsultations should lead to the formulation of binding\r\nagreements, treaties and covenants, the provisions of\r\nwhich should be inviolable and definite.\r\nHumanity’s yearning for peace has already created\r\nan impetus, the gathering momentum of which, despite\r\ntemporary setbacks, cannot be restrained from achieving\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nits ultimate goal. It is in the spirit of this momentum that\r\nwe in the Marshall Islands find it most difficult to\r\nunderstand the need for and the wisdom underlying the\r\nresumption of nuclear tests in the Pacific.\r\nOften heard in this Hall is the resounding siren which\r\ncalls for the practical application of universal democratic\r\nprinciples. Accordingly, what other act could be more\r\nbefitting and courageous on the part of the United Nations\r\nthan to bring about in its own Charter those fundamental\r\nchanges that will ensure the full exercise of those same\r\nprinciples?\r\nThese changes must be carried out with soul-searching\r\ndeliberation in order to ensure the strengthening of an\r\ninstitution whose foundation must be unshakeably firm.\r\nPredicated on humanity’s yearning for a future that bears\r\nthe promise of peace and prosperity, our duty is to devise\r\nthe most acceptable solutions borne of our deepest\r\nconvictions and shared vision.\r\nThe United Nations constitutes the most legitimate\r\nforum through which the interests and concerns of\r\nindividual nations can be expressed, and their fears allayed.\r\nWe are therefore charged with an immense responsibility to\r\ndevelop ways and means to enable the citizens of the world\r\nfully to enjoy the benefits and prosperity of universal peace.\r\nIt is with this in mind that I feel moved to urge that\r\nthe perennial rhetoric must cease. The United Nations must\r\nbecome a truly international governing body and assume the\r\nreins of administering those affairs which affect all nations\r\nand which are best managed at the collective and at the\r\nglobal level.\r\nThe transition we are witnessing is not an oscillation,\r\nnor a fluctuation, nor even a temporary shift in the affairs\r\nof humanity in which normalcy will eventually be restored\r\nafter a short while. It is a global transition, irreversible in\r\nits forward momentum and firm in its purpose. We must\r\ntherefore recognize the futility of insisting upon the\r\npreservation of the sanctity of the status quo in the face of\r\nthese inevitable global changes. Failure to do so would\r\nperpetuate the existence of an order which is lamentably\r\ndefective in its capacity to meet the requirements of a\r\nworld in transition. Change must take place. Our noble task,\r\ntherefore, is to effect the necessary transformation in the\r\npatterns of the prevailing order so as to be able to cause the\r\nefflorescence of the goal of a global society. The status quo\r\ncan no longer remain sacrosanct. It is no longer\r\nmanageable. It has got to be changed.\r\nThe building of a strong foundation based on shared\r\nvalues, exemplified by the founding fathers of the United\r\nNations 50 years ago, must remain our unshakeable\r\npurpose. But our determination and resolve must be\r\nstrengthened, and must be imaginative beyond all past\r\nrecords so that entrenched barriers are removed and the\r\nbasis for laying down the foundation of an unassailable\r\nnew world order is assured permanently.\r\nMay God bless the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof the Marshall Islands for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amata Kabua, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo,\r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo,\r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic.\r\nHis Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, President of\r\nthe Gabonese Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Bongo (interpretation from French): We\r\nare met here today to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe signing of the United Nations Charter in San\r\nFrancisco on 26 June 1945. The United Nations system is\r\nthe object of much criticism by international public\r\nopinion. Some say that the United Nations is merely a\r\nforum in which to make speeches. Others say that it is an\r\nineffective organization.\r\nThough such comments are often excessive, they\r\nnevertheless reflect the disarray that afflicts the\r\ninternational community in the face of certain tragic\r\nsituations. The record of our Organization over half a\r\ncentury enables us, however, to draw some lessons from\r\nthe experience we have acquired. Thus, we should\r\ntogether define new undertakings that will help us to\r\nensure the achievement of the purposes set forth in the\r\nCharter.\r\nAs we contemplate those purposes 50 years later,\r\nwhat is the situation of our Organization, when we judge\r\nby the pictures of the terrible events that we see, the\r\npersistence of local and regional conflicts in Bosnia,\r\nCyprus, Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda, Burundi and the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nMiddle East, to mention only those; or if we judge from the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, a daily\r\nmenace to international peace and security?\r\nIf we look at the under-development that persists\r\ntoday, with its train of evils, some might be tempted to say\r\nthat the United Nations has not played a positive role\r\nworthy to go down in history.\r\nHowever, despite the inadequacies that can be listed,\r\nmany of which can be attributed to the East-West\r\nconfrontation, the United Nations has none the less shown\r\nthat it is indispensable. It has shown, moreover, that it\r\nremains a centre for the harmonization of the actions of\r\nnations in the attainment of the great ideals enshrined in the\r\nSan Francisco Charter.\r\nIndeed, the United Nations can take credit above all\r\nfor ensuring respect for human rights by combatting racism\r\nand all forms of discrimination. It has also contributed\r\ngreatly to democratization, which is under way in many\r\ncountries.\r\nHowever, while it is legitimate to draw satisfaction\r\nfrom the progress made, we must recognize that this could\r\nhave been considerably greater. To that end, in our quest\r\nfor peace, we should have shown greater imagination and\r\nrealism. Instead, we remained content too often with\r\nattitudes that assuaged our consciences without resolving\r\nthe problems. And yet, we all know that efforts for peace\r\nand development depend on us, and only on us, and we\r\nalso know that we can bring about peace and achieve\r\ndevelopment if we all want to do so together.\r\nI say “together” because the challenges to be faced on\r\nthe eve of the third millennium are so complex and so\r\nnumerous, and often cut across national boundaries. Thus,\r\nwithout international cooperation and active political will,\r\nit would be virtually impossible for any country acting\r\nalone, powerful though it might be, to bring about an\r\neffective and definitive response.\r\nUndoubtedly, in the course of these years the United\r\nNations has made remarkable efforts and set in motion vast\r\nprogrammes: the struggle against the illicit trafficking of\r\ndrugs and international terrorism, and the fight against\r\nunder-development; and the campaign against acquired\r\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other diseases.\r\nUnfortunately, the results achieved so far have not satisfied\r\nour hopes and the expectations of our peoples.\r\nWe must therefore commit ourselves even more to\r\npool our resources in order to remove from the world all\r\nthe ills that beset us and to build the peaceful world of\r\nwhich the framers of the Charter dreamed. From that\r\nviewpoint, we need a stronger Organization, one capable\r\nof responding to the needs of the hour and preventing\r\nfuture dangers. The United Nations Charter has given us\r\nthe means. Let us adopt those means in keeping with the\r\ntimes, and let us take action.\r\nThe far-reaching changes of recent years have\r\nconsiderably influenced the course of international life.\r\nThe time has come to revisit the practices of the United\r\nNations in order to bring them into line with the new\r\ncontext. In this process, the Security Council, the\r\nprincipal organ for the maintenance of peace, should be\r\nreformed in order to embrace the present dimensions of\r\nour Organization.\r\nThese are a few reflections to which, I believe, we\r\nmust apply rapid responses if we wish the United Nations\r\ntruly to serve the interests of mankind as a whole.\r\nMany studies with a view to revitalizing the United\r\nNations have been published in recent years. Let us bring\r\nthem together and draw from them any lessons that might\r\nenable our Organization to enhance its effectiveness. And\r\nsince an intergovernmental working group has just been\r\nestablished in order to explore those ideas, let us\r\naccelerate its conclusions so that we can take the\r\nnecessary decisions.\r\nFor the time being, let us strengthen those\r\nmechanisms that have been tried, proved and unanimously\r\naccepted in our common struggle for peace and economic\r\nand social progress.\r\nWith regard to the maintenance of peace and the\r\nsettlement of conflicts, the United Nations should, in most\r\ncases, encourage resort to peaceful means. These means,\r\nwhich include dialogue, negotiation and mutual respect,\r\nin the end always demonstrate their effectiveness. Very\r\noften they prevail over the use of force.\r\nUnfortunately, these means are not always effective.\r\nResort to force then becomes indispensable. In those\r\ncases, let us do so in conformity with the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Charter and, if possible, in cooperation\r\nwith other regional political or military organizations from\r\nthe areas where conflict has broken out.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nIn order to carry out all of these activities, the United\r\nNations needs financial means. We must provide these\r\nthrough the contributions of States. Without them, our\r\nOrganization would be like an automobile without fuel.\r\nThe struggle for peace, especially now, is a struggle\r\nfor development. The absence of economic development\r\ntoday is as much of a threat to peace and security as is\r\nmilitary confrontation. The picture as we see it today is far\r\nfrom encouraging. Indeed, it is a source of deep concern.\r\nResources earmarked for development are dwindling in a\r\ndisturbing way instead of increasing. This poses a threat to\r\nemerging democracies and a danger especially for Africa.\r\nOur deliberations should seriously address that issue.\r\nAt this stage, I should like to express the wish that\r\nrelations between countries of the North and those of the\r\nSouth will be characterized by greater solidarity and\r\nunderstanding.\r\nI wish to propose that a real dialogue, a permanent\r\ndialogue, be established, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, between Heads of State and Government of the\r\nSouth and those of the North. In that way, we may be able\r\nto find solutions to our common problems. The recent\r\nmeetings held under the auspices of the United Nations,\r\nsuch as the Rio Summit on the environment, the\r\nCopenhagen Summit on Social Development and the recent\r\nmeeting on women’s issues in Beijing, provide platforms\r\nreplete with useful proposals. We should be able to put\r\nthese to use in order to give our Organization the new\r\nimpetus it will need as it celebrates its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Gabonese\r\nRepublic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, President of the\r\nGabonese Republic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Zedillo,\r\nPresident of the United Mexican States\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, President\r\nof the United Mexican States.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, President of the\r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Zedillo (interpretation from Spanish): I am\r\nattending this ceremony to express Mexico’s pleasure at\r\nseeing the General Assembly celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nFor reasons of history and conviction, Mexico was\r\namong the founders of the United Nations. Since then, it\r\nhas actively contributed its diplomacy and its vote to the\r\nachievement by the Organization of a membership of 185,\r\nwhich confers upon it universal representation.\r\nMexico recognizes that for half a century the United\r\nNations has been contributing decisively to avoiding a\r\nglobal conflagration and to promoting the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nIn today’s world, serious problems persist which are\r\nat the root of conflicts that in the past gave rise to\r\nconfrontations; globalization and interdependence coexist\r\nalongside trends towards isolationism and intolerance.\r\nRestrictive nationalism, attempts at genocide and\r\nfragmentation, environmental deterioration and drug\r\ntrafficking, economic disparities, social inequality and\r\npoverty are the current threats to peace and security.\r\nFor this reason, the principles underlying and the\r\nraison d’être of the birth of the United Nations are today\r\nstill fully valid. Also for this reason, we must strengthen\r\nthe United Nations as the principal universal forum for\r\ndialogue and peace, for security and cooperation between\r\npeoples, and for ensuring that the relations among States\r\nare governed by international law.\r\nThe United Nations must be the forum for achieving\r\na world free of nuclear threat. Along with the nations of\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, Mexico has established\r\na vast region free of nuclear weapons. Mexico urges the\r\ninternational community to continue working to conclude\r\na comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\r\nThe United Nations must actively promote a\r\ncomprehensive strategy against drug trafficking. It must\r\nwork towards ensuring that the countries that account for\r\nthe bulk of the demand for narcotics do their fair share in\r\nfighting this illicit trafficking.\r\nThe United Nations can and should participate more\r\nvigorously in creating a culture of responsibility towards\r\nthe environment and in cooperating to preserve the rich\r\ndiversity of our planet.\r\nThe United Nations constitutes a particularly useful\r\nforum for promoting respect for human rights and the\r\nculture of indigenous communities, for spreading\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\ndemocracy and justice, and for curbing all forms of racism,\r\nxenophobia and exclusion. The United Nations must\r\ncontribute with much greater creativity and resolve towards\r\npromoting development and combating poverty and towards\r\nensuring the observance of the rights of women and of the\r\ndisabled. The United Nations must contribute to enabling\r\nall peoples to benefit from the opportunities offered by the\r\nworld economy.\r\nInternational peace and security must be founded on\r\ndevelopment and equity. Peace is inseparable from\r\ndevelopment, and security is inseparable from prosperity.\r\nBy sowing the seeds of development, we shall reap peace.\r\nIn those purposes lies the relevance of the United\r\nNations; they renew and enhance the tasks of the\r\nOrganization, and they give its mission permanence and\r\nvitality. To strengthen the fulfilment of this mission,\r\nMexico favours a reform of the United Nations system.\r\nMexico will work for a reform that is respectful of the\r\npurposes and principles that gave birth to the Organization,\r\na reform that ensures a more democratic, transparent and\r\nefficient system, better equipped to forge a future of peace.\r\nMexico reiterates its confidence in the United Nations\r\nas the forum that most fully represents the diversity of\r\nmankind and the plurality of nations, and reaffirms that it\r\nwill continue to work with our Organization for peace and\r\nfor the progress of all peoples.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the United\r\nMexican States for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, President of the\r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov,\r\nPresident of Turkmenistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov,\r\nPresident of Turkmenistan.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov, President of\r\nTurkmenistan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Niyazov (interpretation from Russian): As\r\nI address the General Assembly on behalf of the\r\nindependent State of Turkmenistan for the first time, I\r\nwould like at the outset to congratulate all of you, Your\r\nExcellencies, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe world’s highest forum.\r\nSince declaring its independence, and since\r\nbecoming a Member of the United Nations on 2 March\r\n1992, Turkmenistan has been able to participate\r\nindependently in the affairs of the world community at a\r\ntime when a new world model is being shaped. The\r\ntwentieth-century ideological confrontation between blocs\r\nis gone, and mankind must choose which way to go.\r\nTurkmenistan has made its choice on the basis of\r\nprinciple, by declaring its firm adherence to the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations. We stand together\r\nwith those who believe in the philosophy of uniting the\r\nworld while recognizing the differences that exist; we\r\nstand together with those who recognize the primacy of\r\nthe United Nations in devising programmes of civilized\r\npartnership free from diktat and the imposition of ideas\r\nand ways of life.\r\nTurkmenistan supports efforts to improve the United\r\nNations and its structures. The world has changed, and so\r\nhave the conditions under which States exist. This must\r\nbe reflected also in the work of the United Nations. We\r\nagree that it is necessary to enlarge the Security Council\r\nso that it adequately represents the interests of all States\r\nand regions. Striving for the creation of a new, civilized\r\nworld order must involve the democratization of the\r\ndecision-making mechanism and the participation of all\r\nStates in this process.\r\nThe new non-polar world is a community of equal\r\npartners, where countries are not divided into the small\r\nand the large, the central and the peripheral. There should\r\nbe no elite countries with special powers and prerogatives\r\nthat rightfully belong to the entire world community. Such\r\nan approach would enhance responsibility for the\r\nimplementation of United Nations decisions and for their\r\neffective fulfilment; this is the main issue on the agenda\r\nof the General Assembly at its current session.\r\nMr. Nujoma (President of Namibia), Vice-President\r\nof the General Assembly, took the Chair.\r\nThis problem is relevant because, unfortunately,\r\noptimistic expectations that the end of the cold war would\r\nmake the world a safer place have not materialized. The\r\nnew realities have not solved the old problems, and the\r\nemergence of independent States has given birth to new\r\nconflicts in various regions of the globe.\r\nWe are painfully aware of their effects in our part of\r\nthe world, in Asia. Given its enormous human potential\r\ncoupled with its natural and intellectual resources, our\r\ncontinent has every possibility to become the richest and\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nmost prosperous region in the world. Unfortunately,\r\ninstability and long-standing regional conflicts have become\r\na permanent political backdrop in Asia, which considerably\r\nhinders the resolution of matters relating to domestic\r\ndevelopment. Therefore there is a strong need for that\r\ncontinent to consider such vitally important issues as the\r\ncreation of a more just and equitable order in the areas of\r\nthe economy, information and cultural exchanges. Of no\r\nless importance is the task of halting attempts to form\r\npolitical blocs on the basis of linguistic, religious or\r\ngeographic commonality.\r\nAccordingly, Turkmenistan has embarked upon the\r\nroad of seizing this historic opportunity for independent\r\ndevelopment; after all, the last Turkmen State existed eight\r\ncenturies ago. The Turkmen nation is the successor of the\r\nworld’s most ancient civilizations, such as those of the\r\nParthians, the Seljuks and others. During their centuries-old\r\nhistory, replete with drama, triumph and tragedy, the\r\nTurkmen people accumulated a powerful spiritual potential\r\nwhile preserving their national identity. Basing ourselves on\r\nthis historical foundation and on recent experience, we have\r\nmanaged to preserve social stability in this crucial period.\r\nWithin a short time we have developed and\r\nimplemented programmes of national State-building and\r\nhave established links with the rest of the world. The model\r\nof our statehood is consonant with the national character\r\nand traditions of the Turkmen people and reflects universal\r\nhuman principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. We harmonize each step that we take, on the one\r\nhand, with the national interests of Turkmenistan and, on\r\nthe other, with the requirements of regional stability and the\r\nstrengthening of international security. Furthermore, we are\r\nbecoming increasingly convinced that the former is\r\ninseparable from the latter.\r\nThis has particular importance for us: Turkmenistan is\r\nlocated at a major world crossroads; it has more than a\r\nquarter of the world’s deposits of hydrocarbons and it ranks\r\nfourth in natural gas reserves. This clearly underscores that\r\nour policy of neutrality is correct and will meet the interests\r\nof international cooperation, bearing in mind\r\nTurkmenistan’s geographical location. It is from this that\r\nwe draw the logic of Turkmenistan’s policy of constructive\r\nneutrality; we appeal to this high forum of Heads of State\r\nor Government for support for our initiative.\r\nWe are ready to cooperate fully with all so that our\r\npotential is used for common good on the basis of equal\r\npartnership and mutual benefit. It is destiny’s choice that in\r\nterms of international relations Turkmenistan should be a\r\npart of both Europe and Asia. In this context, we fully\r\nshare the view of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, that new connecting roads should go\r\nthrough Turkmenistan and its neighbouring countries and\r\nthat a transcontinental link between Europe and Asia\r\nshould be built.\r\nThis thought is consonant with our firm belief that\r\nthere is today a new region, formed of the States of\r\nCentral Asia, the Middle East, South-West Asia, parts of\r\nthe Caucasus and the Near East. Many countries of this\r\nregion have become members of the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (ECO), which aims at\r\ndeveloping active partnership between regions,\r\nparticularly with the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations and the European Union. Next year Turkmenistan\r\nwill assume the presidency of the ECO and will spare no\r\neffort to promote those beneficial processes. In this\r\ncontext, we highly appreciate the initiative of France to\r\nhost the first summit of Heads of State of Europe and\r\nAsia in spring next year.\r\nTurkmenistan pursues a policy of permanent positive\r\nneutrality, strictly adhering in practice to the rules of\r\ninternational conduct incumbent upon a neutral State. In\r\nthis connection I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Heads of State or Government who have\r\nbacked our initiative both at the bilateral level and within\r\nthe framework of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. I would like to express gratitude to the States\r\nmembers of the Non-Aligned Movement that unanimously\r\nvoiced their support for Turkmenistan’s policy of\r\nneutrality at their eleventh summit, recently held at\r\nCartagena. We are grateful to States members of the ECO\r\nand to our neighbours for their understanding of our good\r\nintentions and objectives. Neutral Turkmenistan is ready\r\nto promote United Nations goals in implementing its\r\nprogramme of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-\r\nkeeping and peace-building. We recognize that the status\r\nof neutrality implies not only rights but also\r\nresponsibilities, which we fully undertake and are ready\r\nto fulfil in accordance with the principles of the United\r\nNations.\r\nFor centuries, Turkmenistan was known for its\r\nunique Akhalteke horses, its wonderful carpets and its\r\nnatural resources. Today it is striving to be known in the\r\nworld for its political position. Magtimguly, a Turkmen\r\nclassical writer and philosopher, once said, “There is no\r\nneed for words of irritation or spite; my nation does not\r\naccept any spite”. Those words, spoken two centuries ago,\r\nhave acquired new meaning today. Independent,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\ndemocratic and neutral Turkmenistan will take part in\r\ncommon endeavours towards the achievement of goodness,\r\nfairness and humanism, and towards the triumph of the\r\nideals of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of\r\nTurkmenistan for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov, President of\r\nTurkmenistan, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Guntis Ulmanis,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Guntis Ulmanis,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Ulmanis (spoke in Latvian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I congratulate the United\r\nNations on its golden anniversary. It is my wish that our\r\nwork may be harmonious and productive during this period\r\nof celebration, remembrance and appraisal.\r\nThe peoples of the United Nations, in establishing the\r\nOrganization, were determined to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. This end was sought\r\nat a time when hope and idealism prevailed in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nLatvia should have been one of the original signatories\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, but was not because\r\nit was under occupation at that time. However, the United\r\nNations message of freedom and equality helped to sustain\r\nhope in Latvia during the long years of occupation. For\r\ntheir part, Latvians and their Baltic brethren in exile turned\r\nto the United Nations, seeking to return the Baltic States to\r\nthe community of nations. Today, as a Member State of the\r\nUnited Nations, Latvia participates in efforts to improve the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMuch has been achieved during the existence of the\r\nUnited Nations. Peace and reconciliation have been made\r\npossible through preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping\r\nunder United Nations auspices. Humanitarian assistance has\r\nbeen brought to crisis points around the world, ensuring\r\nsurvival and shelter for millions of people. The\r\nOrganization has been a forum in which initiatives vitally\r\nimportant for humanity have been launched.\r\nThe end of the cold war has given us an opportunity\r\nto fulfil the vision of the founders of the United Nations:\r\nthe creation of a global order in which the principles of\r\nthe Charter are respected and its purposes are achieved.\r\nStill, the present situation in the world evokes historical\r\nanalogies with the era in which the League of Nations\r\nassumed responsibility for collective security. A\r\ngeneration of Latvians still alive today clearly recalls the\r\nresults of aggression and its appeasement in 1939. I say\r\nthis with full accountability, because I know the road to\r\nCalvary that has been travelled by Latvia and its people.\r\nSince its establishment, the United Nations has\r\nsought to meet the various challenges to international\r\npeace and security. Threats in the modern era differ from\r\nthose that existed prior to the Second World War.\r\nConflict avoidance mechanisms such as preventive\r\ndiplomacy and other confidence-building measures have\r\nbecome fundamental for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Modern threats challenge States and\r\npeople indiscriminately. No one is immune to the effects\r\nof transnational crime, terrorism and trafficking in\r\nnarcotics and nuclear materials. These problems do not\r\nrespect national boundaries; States and societies cannot\r\nsolve them individually. Indeed, interdependence benefits\r\neach State individually and sustains the whole.\r\nThe watchword for this session is ”reform”. Latvia\r\nactively participates in the efforts to reform and\r\nstrengthen the United Nations System, in order that it\r\nmay more effectively serve the peoples of our planet. The\r\nchanges and uncertainty in the world will determine the\r\nnature of reform.\r\nThe operation of the Security Council must continue\r\nto become more transparent and open, while preserving\r\nthe Council’s effectiveness. Its expansion must increase\r\nthe role of small countries, respect the principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution and take into account\r\nthe new geopolitical realities of the post-cold-war era.\r\nReforms to improve the financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations must be two-pronged: innovative\r\nfinancing mechanisms must be developed and the existing\r\nassessment mechanism must be corrected to reflect fully\r\nthe principle of sovereign equality. Reforms must address\r\nthe obstacles that prevent many Member States from\r\nmeeting their assessments in full and on time.\r\nWorld conferences in Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen\r\nand Beijing have adopted Declarations and Programmes\r\nof Action the implementation of which is dependent on\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nthe resolve of States. In accordance with the\r\nrecommendations of the World Conference on Human\r\nRights, Latvia has established an independent State Human\r\nRights Office. An important and constructive role in its\r\nestablishment was played by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and its office in Latvia.\r\nThe survival of humanity is unimaginable without\r\nserious measures to protect our environment. To this end,\r\nLatvia is seeking to hold, at the dawn of the new century,\r\nan international conference on disarmament and its\r\nrelationship to the environment and to development.\r\nEvery task is achievable, if only States have the\r\nnecessary determination and will. Rainis, the Latvian poet\r\nand Nobel Prize nominee, has said: “That which transforms,\r\nwill survive.” Thus, the United Nations must change, so\r\nthat our aspirations for the next century may come to\r\nfruition.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinson,\r\nPresident of Ireland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\nan address by Her Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinson,\r\nPresident of Ireland.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinson, President of\r\nIreland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Robinson: The 51 States that founded this\r\nOrganization in 1945 wrought well. The United Nations has\r\nbecome the first universal organization of States in human\r\nhistory; and it has shaped the whole structure of\r\ninternational relations through the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\nBut our Special Commemorative Meeting will be an\r\nempty ritual, quickly forgotten, if we limit ourselves to\r\ncongratulation. This is a time to adapt and renew what we\r\nhave inherited; a time for vision, equal now to that of half\r\na century ago; above all a time for Member States to make\r\na new commitment and carry it through in action.\r\nWe are close to the end of a century and near to the\r\nopening of a new millennium. Was there ever a time of\r\nsuch possibility? Was there ever a time for such concern?\r\nHumankind now holds the fate of all other species in its\r\nhands; it fills the planet; it owns the Earth.\r\nHow shall we organize ourselves to meet this\r\nawesome responsibility? Human nature will not change,\r\nbut throughout history, humanity has also shown a deep\r\ncapacity for compassion and for solidarity — initially to\r\nfamily, and then to wider kin, to clan, to tribe, to city and\r\nto nation. Can we now learn to extend our solidarity and\r\ncompassion to the whole human family in all its rich\r\ndiversity; and beyond it, to all other life on the planet,\r\nwhich is now ours to conserve or to destroy? Fragile and\r\ntransient we may be as individuals but we are stewards\r\nfor all the life we know and for the Earth which bears it.\r\nThose of us who exercise leadership of nations at\r\nthis time will have to understand and accept this\r\nenormous responsibility. We live in a world of sovereign\r\nStates: a world where conflict is a constant danger and\r\nweapons grow endlessly in power; a world where States\r\non occasion collapse in anarchy and where the passion\r\nand fear aroused in ethnic conflict can lead to genocide.\r\nIt is a world where problems of ecology and climate and\r\nresources are global; where population grows; where\r\npoverty, hunger and injustice oppress millions of people.\r\nThis is our world in the late twentieth century. At\r\nthe centre we need an effective universal Organization\r\nwhich will address global problems in the common\r\ninterest; which will avert or end war; advance human\r\nrights; establish a rule of law based on justice between\r\nStates; mobilize the human capacity for compassion and\r\nsolidarity to help the disadvantaged; protect the\r\ndefenceless; and promote human freedom and potential.\r\nWe have such an Organization in place and we can\r\nadapt and develop it. But let us be honest and speak\r\nplainly.\r\nToday, on its fiftieth birthday, the United Nations is\r\nin crisis. The whole future of the United Nations as an\r\neffective global Organization is in question. Its authority\r\nis uncertain, its financial situation dire. Its Member States\r\ngive it tasks which exceed its present capacity. They stint\r\nand limit their support and then blame it for lack of\r\nsuccess in enterprises which their own lack of support has\r\ndoomed to failure.\r\nI have just come back from a visit to Rwanda and I\r\nknow at first hand the tragic consequences which this can\r\nhave. If we do not act together soon to change this, if we\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\ndo not infuse the United Nations and the family of\r\norganizations which has grown around it with a new sense\r\nof purpose and a new sense of direction — a genuine\r\nglobal ethic — then I fear that the praise we give to the\r\nUnited Nations from this rostrum over these days will come\r\nin time to be read as its epitaph.\r\nIt is the view of the Irish Government that four steps\r\ncould be taken in this year to transform the situation and\r\ninfuse the United Nations with new vigour.\r\nFirst must be finance. The United Nations is grinding\r\nto a halt for lack of it. Just imagine if each of us who\r\ncomes to this rostrum were to limit what we say to 16\r\nwords: my Government has met all its assessed\r\ncontributions in full — we have paid what we owe. What\r\nan impact that would have, what an anniversary gift for the\r\nOrganization! Later perhaps we might begin to study\r\nvarious proposals which have been made for other, more\r\nautonomous means of financing the United Nations and its\r\nagencies. Of course, one accepts that there is room for\r\ngreater efficiency in the United Nations as in many large\r\npublic-service organizations throughout the world. But this\r\ncan in no way excuse the failure to pay contributions.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council, in conjunction with\r\nthe Secretary-General and drawing on his advice, should\r\nexamine, clarify and codify its procedures for undertaking\r\nand running peace-keeping operations and enforcement\r\naction. To restore its authority it must ensure that the\r\ndecisions it takes and the mandates it gives are clear and\r\nthat there will be both a determination and a capacity on\r\nthe part of all concerned to carry them through.\r\nThirdly, it is time to consider seriously how to ensure\r\nthat in the early stages of a crisis, when a peace-keeping\r\noperation is urgently needed and when it may be most\r\neffective, the United Nations will be in a position to\r\nrespond. We should consider what more can be done to\r\nprovide stand-by units — military and police. For example,\r\nis it not possible to think about proposals which have been\r\nmade for a modest international volunteer force at the\r\ndisposal of the Secretary-General under the direction of the\r\nSecurity Council?\r\nFourthly, it is time now to take decisions on the\r\nenlargement of the Council to make it more representative\r\nand thereby increase its authority.\r\nThese steps, in the view of the Irish Government,\r\nwould be a beginning. It is a modest programme; it is\r\nfeasible and realistic and it would give us confidence for\r\nthe many further changes which will be necessary to\r\nstrengthen the authority and the capacity of the United\r\nNations and fit it to address the problems of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of\r\nIreland for her statement.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinson, President of\r\nIreland, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Wim Kok, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for General Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by His Excellency Mr. Wim Kok, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for General Affairs of the Kingdom\r\nof the Netherlands.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wim Kok, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Kok: First of all, I would like to join those who\r\nhave already paid tribute to the United Nations on its\r\nfiftieth anniversary.\r\nThis Commemorative Meeting is a good opportunity\r\nto reflect on both the achievements and the shortcomings\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWe have to ask ourselves why, after 50 years, so\r\nfew of the original ideals laid down in the Charter have\r\nbeen fully realized. When doing this, we have to be aware\r\nthat we, the Member States, play a crucial role in every\r\nsuccess or failure of the United Nations.\r\nThe main task before us is to come to grips with\r\nreality. We must determine what it is that we want from\r\nthe United Nations and how much we are willing to pay,\r\npolitically and financially, in order to let the Organization\r\ndo its work.\r\nWe are well aware of the fact that the Organization\r\nis facing huge problems reconciling the tasks it is\r\nsupposed to carry out with the means its Member States\r\nare willing to provide. Indeed, in the last few years, the\r\ninternational community has enthusiastically made\r\ndemands on the United Nations on an ever-increasing\r\nscale but without showing a similar degree of enthusiasm\r\nin providing the necessary financial means.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nThe Member States must learn to be more realistic in\r\nwhat they ask of the United Nations. To that end, we need\r\nagreement on the core functions of the United Nations, we\r\nneed a realistic assessment of the capabilities of the United\r\nNations to perform these core functions, we need agreement\r\non a division of labour within the Organization as well as\r\nwith other international organizations, we need recognition\r\nof the fact that in order to be relevant the United Nations\r\nneeds a more result-oriented approach and we need to bring\r\nthe debate on reforming the United Nations to a concrete\r\nend so that the United Nations can adapt to new realities\r\nand new challenges.\r\nThe Netherlands strongly supports multilateralism. We\r\nneed the United Nations: there is no alternative. We still\r\nadhere to the tasks described in the Charter: the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security, the protection of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, and respect for the rule\r\nof international law. But we are facing immense new\r\nchallenges as well, such as the problems related to the\r\nenvironment and sustainable development, overpopulation,\r\nintra-State conflicts, drugs and terrorism.\r\nI agree with the agenda as described this morning by\r\nPresident Clinton to intensify our efforts in the fight against\r\ninternational organized crime in all its aspects.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the Open-ended\r\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations System. The Netherlands is willing to seek\r\nsupport for this approach and work with other Member\r\nStates towards practical solutions. I would like to see the\r\nprocess of reform culminating in concrete decisions to be\r\ntaken ultimately in 1998.\r\nStructure and working methods have to be\r\nmodernized. The United Nations needs a more efficient and\r\neffective management avoiding duplication and overlap.\r\nThe Swedish Prime Minister, Mr. Ingvar Carlsson, has\r\ntaken the initiative to instal a group of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment that will try to actively guide the process of\r\nreform of the United Nations. The Netherlands is happy to\r\ntake part in this initiative and will support any action that\r\nwill give an impetus to the dynamics of the process of\r\nreform and renewal. The Heads of State or Government are\r\ngetting together tomorrow morning in order to discuss how\r\nto proceed further.\r\nThe current cash-flow crisis of the Organization is\r\nextremely serious. If no action is taken, the United Nations\r\nwill run out of cash some time next year. I should like to\r\nemphasize that all Member States have to honour their\r\nobligation under the Charter and under international law\r\nto pay their contributions to the United Nations in full, on\r\ntime and without conditions. This is a sine qua non on\r\nwhich the very existence of the United Nations is based.\r\nTo sum up, we cannot do without a strong United\r\nNations. Much of what the United Nations has\r\naccomplished over the past 50 years is too useful and too\r\nprecious to give up, but we have to show a sense of\r\nurgency in our efforts to prepare the Organization for the\r\nits important work in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wim Kok, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency the Right Honourable John\r\nG. M. Compton, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nFinance, Planning and Development of Saint Lucia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by His Excellency the Right Honourable John\r\nG. M. Compton, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,\r\nPlanning and Development of Saint Lucia.\r\nHis Excellency the Right Honourable John G. M.\r\nCompton, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,\r\nPlanning and Development of Saint Lucia, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Compton: On this the fiftieth anniversary of its\r\nfounding, my country shares the sense of achievement of\r\nMember States of the United Nations that our efforts have\r\nrewarded the hopes of the founding fathers that the\r\nOrganization should save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war. It was also the express wish that the\r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large and\r\nsmall should be respected and protected.\r\nIn many ways, the Member States of the United\r\nNations have embraced the four freedoms of the Atlantic\r\nCharter and tried to elevate them to universal truths. I\r\nrefer to freedom of speech and expression, freedom of\r\nworship or conscience, freedom from want and freedom\r\nfrom fear.\r\nWe have struggled over the past half-century to\r\nattain these ideals, but in our human imperfections we\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nhave fallen short of full glory. Somehow, Nirvana has\r\neluded us. We have to admit that the idealism of the 1940s\r\nseems to have lapsed into the materialism of the 1990s. The\r\nunderlying sense of equity and justice which informed the\r\noriginal Charter is somewhat overshadowed by events in the\r\nglobal village today. In the theatre of war, that sense of\r\nexhilaration and deeper humanity which came in the wake\r\nof the horrors of Belsen and Auschwitz seems to have\r\nslipped back into the double focus of the atrocities of\r\nBosnia and the genocide of Rwanda.\r\nAt the level of trade and development we have seen a\r\nsystematic reduction in foreign aid and aggressive\r\ncompetition, and even those institutions such as the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization and the\r\nInternational Development Agency, which were created\r\nspecifically to help the wretched of the Earth, are either\r\nstarved of support or threatened with extinction. The dream\r\nhas dimmed, but not completely faded. We must all\r\nredouble our efforts to ensure that the Charter’s vibrant call\r\nfor equal rights, with its comforting implication of racial\r\nharmony, is not mocked by the xenophobia which threatens\r\nWestern society today.\r\nHowever, in spite of these developments, which seem\r\nto have violated the idealism of the founding fathers, the\r\nOrganization has much cause for celebration. Its many\r\norgans and agencies, which work quietly and efficiently\r\naway from the glare of the media, have many achievements\r\nto their credit. They are engaged in silent battles against\r\nman’s ancient enemies of ignorance, poverty and disease.\r\nThey have kept the peace in many parts of the world\r\nwithout the fanfare of international commendation. They\r\nhave registered remarkable successes in freeing subject-\r\npeoples from the yoke of colonial domination.\r\nIn recent weeks we have seen the other half of\r\nhumanity, some would say the better half, the women of\r\nthe world, emerge from the shadows of neglect seeking to\r\nshed the effects of centuries of discrimination. They took to\r\nthe world stage, seriously and purposefully, at the United\r\nNations-sponsored Conference at Beijing. Their powerful\r\nvoices demanded to be recognized as what creation\r\nintended them to be, the helpmates and equal partners of\r\nmen. Such triumphs demand not only observation on our\r\nfiftieth anniversary, but celebration as well.\r\nI should like to congratulate the President and his\r\ncountry for his elevation to the presidency of this time-\r\nhonoured body. May I further express my country’s\r\nempathy with the programmes and policies espoused by our\r\nSecretary-General Mr. Boutros-Ghali. But most of all, let\r\nme pay tribute to all the Member countries of the United\r\nNations which have fought so valiantly in the past 50\r\nyears to preserve the spirit of San Francisco.\r\nWe have scored many remarkable victories in South\r\nAfrica, in Haiti and more tentatively, in the Middle East.\r\nWe must now face squarely the convoluted problems of\r\nAfrica. We must support the brave initiative of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean to forge an impressive\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States. These exciting initiatives\r\nundertaken by the countries of the Caribbean Basin cut\r\nclear across the barriers of race, language and culture.\r\nThey embrace vast countries as well as small islands, and\r\nit is our fervent hope that this Association will be the\r\nmicrocosm of the United Nations in search of peace,\r\njustice and equality.\r\nThe lofty ideals which brought us together must be\r\nrecaptured. We must avoid the debilitating and\r\ndemoralizing effects of materialism and make an effort to\r\nrecapture the spirit of San Francisco.\r\nLooking back, we are reminded of the haunting\r\nwords of the poem Desiderata, which says:\r\n“With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams\r\nIt is still a beautiful world.”\r\nLet us all strive to make it even more beautiful in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Finance, Planning and Development of\r\nSaint Lucia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency the Right Honourable John G. M.\r\nCompton, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,\r\nPlanning and Development of Saint Lucia, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mario Frick, Prime\r\nMinister of the Principality of Liechtenstein\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by His Excellency Mr. Mario Frick, Prime\r\nMinister of the Principality of Liechtenstein.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mario Frick, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Principality of Liechtenstein, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nMr. Frick: This commemorative meeting is a very\r\nsolemn event, doing justice to the impressive history of the\r\nUnited Nations and to its unique role in today’s world, and\r\nI am honoured to add Liechtenstein’s voice to the\r\ncelebrations. In view of the limited time at our disposal, we\r\nhave to focus on those issues which appear to be of\r\nparticular importance, but I attach great importance to\r\nemphasizing that other topics, which I will not be able to\r\nmention today, deserve the same attention and our most\r\ncareful consideration.\r\nLiechtenstein joined the United Nations only five years\r\nago, but we had long benefited from the Organization’s\r\nachievements. The United Nations has defined international\r\nhuman-rights standards and has laid the foundation for the\r\ninternational promotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. The United Nations system has\r\nstrengthened and expanded international law, and it has\r\npromoted the recognition of the human rights of women as\r\nwell as the active participation of women in all sectors of\r\nsociety.\r\nToday we are looking back at 50 years of the\r\nexistence of the United Nations, which are rich in events,\r\nturning-points and changes. Above all, however, it is our\r\nduty to look forward and, drawing from the experience we\r\nhave acquired in half a century, to strengthen the capacities\r\nand the effectiveness of the United Nations, which today,\r\nmore than ever, is faced with numerous, enormous tasks.\r\nNew problems and new challenges call for new,\r\ncreative and flexible approaches. No one can deny that the\r\nUnited Nations today is not always able to respond swiftly\r\nand effectively to sometimes rapidly changing situations or,\r\nas would be most desirable, to become active in a\r\npreventive manner.\r\nA comprehensive reform and restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations system is necessary to achieve this goal and\r\nwe are therefore pleased that all Member States have\r\nagreed to make serious and coordinated efforts in this\r\nrespect. The reform of the Security Council, the Agenda for\r\nPeace and the Agenda for Development constitute crucial\r\nelements in this process. But we have to realize that no\r\nreform, however artful it may be, can be successful unless\r\nwe are able to finally provide the Organization with a\r\nsound financial base. We are, in this context, especially\r\nconcerned about the endangering of peace-keeping\r\noperations. It is unacceptable that the United Nations, while\r\nat the centre of the attention and expectations of people,\r\nshould find itself continuously grappling with serious\r\nfinancial problems. Various measures can be useful in\r\nworking towards this goal, and several promising\r\nproposals have been made in this respect including the\r\nimproved use of available resources. The most important\r\nrequirement, however, remains that we all pay fully and\r\non time the contributions which we are obliged to pay\r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn recent years, United Nations activities have been\r\nmarked by radical changes on the global political map, a\r\nconsiderable increase in the membership of the\r\nOrganization and the holding of several major conferences\r\nin different fields. Those conferences have made very\r\nclear the extent to which the major issues of concern to\r\nthe United Nations are interdependent, and we agree with\r\nthose who believe that we should now focus our efforts\r\non the implementation of the respective outcomes of those\r\nconferences.\r\nWhile the future structure and work of the United\r\nNations will have to be shaped and elaborated through the\r\ncareful efforts and negotiations of our delegations, we\r\ncan, at this Commemorative Meeting, send a strong\r\nmessage by making very clear that we remain genuinely\r\ncommitted to the purposes and principles of this\r\nOrganization and that we are willing to do everything\r\npossible to achieve those purposes. Whatever changes and\r\nchallenges the future may bring, the effectiveness of the\r\nwork of the United Nations will always depend on the\r\npolitical will of its Members, and subsequent credibility\r\nin the eyes of the peoples that we represent.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Prime Minister\r\nof the Principality of Liechtenstein for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mario Frick, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Principality of Liechtenstein, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nJean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by His Excellency The Right Honourable Jean\r\nChrétien, Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Jean Chrétien,\r\nPrime Minister of Canada, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Chrétien (interpretation from French): For 50\r\nyears now the United Nations has symbolized Canada’s\r\nbest hopes for a world at peace. I believe there is a\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nsimple reason for this commitment. The United Nations\r\nstands for the rule of law, for social and political justice\r\nand for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThese are important principles for Canadians. They are\r\nat the heart of our identity. For although Canadians\r\nsometimes forget it, the highest hope of the global\r\ncommunity is to achieve what we in Canada have achieved\r\nfor ourselves: a means of living together in peace and\r\nunderstanding. While we do not have an answer to every\r\nproblem, we do have the means to pursue these answers\r\ntogether — with respect, tolerance, accommodation and\r\ncompromise.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThrough 50 years the United Nations has struggled\r\nagainst racism and colonialism, against disease and\r\nilliteracy. It has stood up for those who have no voice —\r\nthe oppressed, and millions of women and children around\r\nthe world. It has contained many conflicts and brought\r\nrelief to their victims. But the work is far from finished.\r\nPeace remains elusive for millions around the world. The\r\nrights of nations and the rights of individuals under\r\ninternational law must still be defended. The gap between\r\nrich and poor countries is far too wide. The right balance\r\nbetween economic development and a healthy environment\r\nmust be established.\r\nWe have so much to do. But now the United Nations\r\nitself is under attack. We see it in the financial crisis. Too\r\nmany States do not pay their dues on time and in full. But\r\nfinances are only a symptom of a deeper crisis, a growing\r\nbelief that nations cannot work together effectively on\r\nissues of common concern.\r\nSome argue that global approaches are too complex.\r\nOthers say that the United Nations is too expensive, and not\r\nworth the cost. These arguments betray a lack of confidence\r\nin the future, and Canada will have none of it.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nToday, even more than 50 years ago, it is truly one\r\nworld. More than ever we need the United Nations. We\r\nneed it to maintain international stability and order. We\r\nneed it to tackle problems that do not respect borders —\r\nAIDS, drugs, terrorism. We can make the United Nations\r\nbetter. Countries which can pay their dues should, now. We\r\ncan reform the scale of assessments to reflect current\r\neconomic realities and should without delay.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Security Council can be more representative and\r\ncan improve its transparency, its consultations and its\r\nmandates for peace-keeping. Improvements are under\r\nway. Let us finish the job.\r\nWe can react more quickly to crises. Canada has\r\nsubmitted a study on ways to improve the rapid\r\ndeployment of military and civilian United Nations\r\npersonnel. We are encouraged that the United Nations is\r\nstudying these proposals seriously. We can review the\r\nmandates of the specialized agencies and make sure that\r\nthey are dealing with the right issues in the right way.\r\nThe Secretary-General is working to cut waste and\r\nfind efficiencies throughout the United Nations. We are\r\neach doing this in our own countries. We should do no\r\nless for the United Nations.\r\nFifty years ago, in the ashes of a world war, in the\r\nshadow of 50 million dead, our predecessors found the\r\nstrength to believe in a better future, and the courage and\r\nthe determination to build one. The result was the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations. Surely we, the\r\nleaders of 1995, should do no less.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI pledge to the Assembly that Canada is committed\r\nto that task. Canadians believe in the future. Without that\r\ndeep, unyielding belief we would not have built the\r\ncountry that the United Nations has named the best\r\ncountry in the world in which to live. That unshakeable\r\nbelief is what we brought to the first 50 years of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is what we commit to the next 50\r\nyears.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of\r\nCanada for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of\r\nCanada, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ali Akbar Velayati,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Special Envoy of the\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ali Akbar Velayati,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Special Envoy of the\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Akbar Velayati, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Special Envoy of the President of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Velayati (spoke in Persian; interpretation\r\nprovided by the delegation): The United Nations signifies\r\nthe culmination of the perennial aspirations of humanity to\r\neschew war and conflict and to foster development, mutual\r\nrespect, peace, understanding and cooperation between all\r\npeoples of the world. It was born in the aftermath of two of\r\nthe most devastating wars in all human history, emanating\r\nfrom Europe and engulfing the globe. From the ashes of\r\nwar rose a new structure that assumed the responsibility of\r\nensuring peace and security in the world. Principles drawn\r\nup in the Charter of the United Nations became the\r\ncornerstone of international law for the resolution of\r\ndisputes and the promotion of peaceful solutions to\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn retrospect, the wisdom of the underlying principles\r\nof the United Nations is vividly clear. Indeed, what has\r\nunited us in this world body is our collective embrace of\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations, so\r\neloquently enshrined in the Charter. Adherence to and\r\nrespect for these principles will thus undoubtedly strengthen\r\nthe Organization and enhance its role, while any attempt to\r\nevade the responsibilities that we have all undertaken under\r\nthis covenant, however appealing and convenient it might\r\nappear in the short term to do so, will sow the seeds of its\r\ngradual disintegration.\r\nThe United Nations gains its uniqueness and strength\r\nfrom its universal character, which is even more impressive\r\nin the light of the diversity of its constituent elements and\r\nwhich can be maintained and enhanced only through respect\r\nfor such diversity. In the prudent letter and spirit of the\r\nCharter, faith in and, thus, protection of, fundamental\r\nhuman rights, the dignity and worth of the human person,\r\nand equal rights of men and women cannot be divorced\r\nfrom respect for equality of nations, large and small.\r\nThere can therefore be no justification for any attempt\r\nto impose the will or values of a few over the rest of\r\nhumanity or to enhance the perception of security of the\r\nprivileged few at the expense of subjecting the rest of\r\nhumanity to the nightmare of nuclear holocaust. Many of\r\nthe ills of the international community stem from the\r\ndiversion of precious resources from development to the\r\narms race. Adding to an already complex problem are\r\nunilateral economic measures, ranging from protectionist\r\npolicies and various forms of conditionalities to outright\r\ncoercive economic measures and the United States policy\r\nof economic terrorism against independent States, as well\r\nas attempts to push aside the development agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations system in the area\r\nof cooperation for development, particularly those carried\r\nout by specialized agencies and programmes, have made\r\ntheir primary contribution by introducing ordinary people\r\nin the remotest parts of the world to the name, if not the\r\nideals, of the United Nations. The development agenda of\r\nthe United Nations should not be overshadowed by other,\r\nmore glamorous subjects or undermined in the course of\r\nreform.\r\nIndeed, the needs and aspirations of those very same\r\npeople, who constitute the majority of humanity, must be\r\nthe focus and foundation of any effort to revitalize,\r\nrestructure and reform the Organization, whose conceptual\r\nobjectives should be to render the United Nations\r\ndecision-making process transparent, democratic, rule\r\nbased and inclusive. This is in total contrast with the self-\r\narrogated position of leadership of the United States,\r\nwhich insists on misusing its position within the\r\nOrganization and, even at the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization, reserves for itself the resort to unilateral\r\nmeasures against the will of the United Nations.\r\nThe key to ensuring the success, continued\r\nrelevance, and moral authority and legitimacy of the\r\nUnited Nations in the next millennium is the\r\nreinvigoration of the underlying concept of sovereign\r\nequality and its full application in all aspects of the work\r\nof the Organization. It implies, first and foremost,\r\nenhancing the role of the General Assembly as the most\r\ndemocratic and representative organ of the United\r\nNations, removing institutionalized and implicit centres of\r\nprivilege and influence and respecting the values of the\r\nequal constituent elements of this unique universal\r\nmosaic.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Special Envoy of the President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Akbar Velayati, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Special Envoy of the President\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Bahige Tabbarah,\r\nMinister of Justice of Lebanon\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Bahige Tabbarah, Minister\r\nof Justice of Lebanon.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bahige Tabbarah, Minister of\r\nJustice of Lebanon, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Tabbarah (interpretation from Arabic): Lebanon\r\nhas been committed to the principles of the United Nations\r\nand to the realization of its objectives since 1945, the year\r\nin which we signed the Charter. Lebanon believes that\r\ninter-State relations must be based on mutual respect and\r\nequality of rights. It also believes in peoples’ right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nLebanon participated in the drafting of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights in 1948. It strongly supported\r\nefforts to eradicate colonialism. To the world, Lebanon has\r\ngiven an example of tolerance and coexistence between\r\ndifferent religions and creeds. Lebanon’s belief in the\r\nprinciples and values on which the United Nations system\r\nwas founded and its conviction that this Organization is the\r\nlast resort for the weak and the oppressed have prompted\r\nus to bring to the attention of the United Nations our\r\nconcerns, in the hope that our rights may be recognized and\r\nour problems may be resolved in the framework of law and\r\ninternational legality.\r\nIn resolution 425 (1978) the Security Council called\r\nfor Israel’s immediate withdrawal from the occupied\r\nLebanese territories. It also called for the need to extend the\r\nauthority of the State all the way to the internationally\r\nrecognized Lebanese boundaries. Today, 17 years after the\r\ndeployment of the international forces in the south, the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is still\r\nunable to carry out its mandate because of the stance of\r\nIsrael which still refuses to withdraw, insists on maintaining\r\nan occupation zone in the southern part of Lebanon,\r\ncontinues to usurp land and detain the innocent and pursues\r\na policy of pressure and intimidation.\r\nWe participated in the peace process in Madrid in\r\ngood faith, on the basis of the Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe are still determined, despite all the setbacks, that this\r\npeace we are striving for should be just and comprehensive;\r\nthat it should guarantee the rights of all peoples in the\r\nregion and ensure the return of the Palestinians to their\r\nhomes. We have learned from history that peace which is\r\nnot based on justice is bound to be temporary. We want a\r\nlasting peace for our region and for future generations.\r\nWe are truly disappointed as we put on record the\r\ninability of the United Nations to implement its\r\nresolutions with regard to Israel, while many other\r\nresolutions are implemented. With bitterness we realize\r\nthat different standards are used in dealing with Member\r\nStates of the Organization.\r\nHowever, such disappointment and bitterness can\r\nonly strengthen our belief in the principles upon which\r\nthis Organization was founded. They must constitute a\r\nserious impetus that should prompt us all to provide the\r\nUnited Nations with the necessary support to strengthen\r\nit and make it capable of implementing the resolutions it\r\nadopts.\r\nProceeding from this and despite our suffering as a\r\nresult of our long ordeal, despite the heavy demands of\r\nreconstruction against a backdrop of economic and social\r\nhardship, Lebanon has paid its assessed contributions to\r\nthe United Nations in full. We take this opportunity of the\r\ngolden anniversary of the United Nations to call upon\r\nMember States of the United Nations, and in particular\r\nthe major Powers, to pay their arrears as a first step\r\ntowards strengthening this Organization and reactivating\r\nit. This shall enable the United Nations to carry out its\r\nmission and achieve the consolidation of peace in various\r\ntroubled regions in the world.\r\nWe do support the work of the Secretariat in the\r\nfield of peacemaking and peace-keeping and consider\r\nsuch work to be not only one of the priorities of the\r\nOrganization, but a core priority indeed.\r\nHowever, we consider that the United Nations is not\r\nonly a unique forum where Members can have their\r\nvoices heard and their complaints addressed. It is\r\nprimarily the international institution that provides\r\nassistance and support to the developing countries so that\r\nthey, in turn, can build their economies and their\r\nsocieties, and gradually bridge the gap between the\r\nindustrial and the developing countries.\r\nWorld peace and understanding and respect for\r\nhuman rights cannot be permanent unless the economic\r\ngap between the rich and the poor countries of the world\r\nis bridged.\r\nWe realize that the challenges in that respect are\r\ngreat. However, we are confident that the international\r\ncommunity can muster the necessary will-power to meet\r\nthem. This can only be done by reactivating the role of\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nthis Organization as a haven for world peace and social\r\njustice.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister of Justice of\r\nLebanon for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bahige Tabbarah, Minister of\r\nJustice of Lebanon, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Alexander Chikvaidze,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Georgia\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nAlexander Chikvaidze, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nGeorgia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alexander Chikvaidze, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Georgia, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Chikvaidze: I should like to begin by extending\r\nmy warmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, selected\r\nby your peers to preside over this historic session, thus\r\nacknowledging your outstanding personal and professional\r\ncontribution to the international community.\r\nAllow me also to address words of deep appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nremarkable dedication to guiding the Parliament of Man\r\nthrough some of its most trying times, and mapping out a\r\nmore secure, peaceful and coherent world for future\r\ngenerations in his Agenda for Peace.\r\nI am pleased and honoured to convey to this unique\r\ngathering the greetings of the Head of State of Georgia, Mr.\r\nEduard Shevardnadze, as well as the gratitude of the people\r\nof Georgia to all Member States for their support of my\r\ncountry in one of the most dramatic moments of its long\r\nhistory.\r\nMr. Shevardnadze was strongly inclined to participate\r\nin this Commemorative Meeting, which is unique in its\r\nimportance and magnitude. The charged atmosphere of\r\nparliamentary and presidential elections, however, did not\r\nallow him to leave the country and deliver his tenth\r\nstatement from this rostrum. He asked me to assure the\r\nAssembly that Georgia is steadily returning to normal life.\r\nA new Constitution has been adopted, a new national\r\ncurrency has been introduced, and, as I just mentioned,\r\npresidential and parliamentary elections will be held on 5\r\nNovember 1995. The Georgian leadership is invariably\r\ndedicated to its objectives of a successful transition to\r\ndemocracy, a market economy, social stability, peace at\r\nhome and friendly relations abroad.\r\nAnniversaries are a time to celebrate, but also a time\r\nto reflect. My Government strongly believes, however,\r\nthat this reflection should not border on pessimism and an\r\nacross-the-board negation of all the achievements of the\r\npast half-century.\r\nIf the United Nations did not exist, we would need\r\nto invent it. Now that it exists, we need to reinvent it. The\r\nUnited Nations is the largest and most powerful tool that\r\ncan be wielded by the collective will of its Member\r\nStates; yet it can only be wielded effectively if we, the\r\nMember States ourselves, are in step with the changes\r\nthat have occurred in the world in the past few years.\r\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations half a\r\ncentury ago realized full well what kind of international\r\nlandscape they had inherited after the Second World War,\r\nand built this Organization to respond to it.\r\nHaving experienced what probably amounts to the\r\nmost momentous change of the twentieth century — the\r\ndisappearance of the hostile confrontation of two different\r\nsocial systems — the political leaders of today have not\r\nundertaken anything of the sort.\r\nIt was obvious that the United Nations was the best\r\ninstrument for restoring to the world a new equilibrium in\r\nplace of the precarious balance of the bipolar world. For\r\nvarious reasons, however, the new world order which\r\nmight have been is being killed in its infancy. It is being\r\nkilled in the former Yugoslavia; it is being killed in\r\nNagorno Karabakh, in Abkhazia and in South Ossetia.\r\nIn the absence of a clear strategy and fresh\r\nphilosophical directions, the Organization, like any large\r\nbureaucracy, is slow to change and, similar to many other\r\ninstitutions of the post-war era, is struggling to find a new\r\nidentity.\r\nWe believe that the new philosophy of the United\r\nNations must give priority to the strategy of “making“\r\npeace over “keeping“ peace. The United Nations is\r\nobliged to break with neutrality in favour of a mandatory\r\nimplementation of the principles of the Charter with\r\nregard to those who break the peace.\r\nThere is also a need for a new method of decision-\r\nmaking — one that would focus on the means of\r\nimplementation, rather than be excessively preoccupied\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nwith procedure and self-serving adjustable wording. We\r\nmust have the courage and the will to call an aggressor an\r\naggressor, and genocide genocide.\r\nPrecedents by which illegitimate extremist groups who\r\nhave violated the United Nations Charter are invited into\r\nthe negotiating process to participate as “parties” and are\r\nrequested to consent to specific measures accord them the\r\nlegitimacy of a “subject of international law” that they seek\r\nand devalue membership of the Organization itself.\r\nThe biggest danger, however, lies in the message that\r\nthese precedents imply — that the force of arms can take\r\nprecedence over the power of law. Georgia firmly believes\r\nthat the global security architecture of today must\r\nencompass relations not only between but also within\r\nStates. Georgia’s example clearly demonstrates that the\r\nterritorial integrity of a State is made up of the integrity of\r\nthe lives and rights of its citizens.\r\nWithout individual rights, there are no rights of\r\npeoples or of humankind. Without individual rights, there\r\nis neither stability of States nor global order. It would be a\r\ntragedy of monumental proportions, and a lost opportunity\r\nfor which succeeding generations would never forgive us,\r\nif we did not finally take advantage of the unique opening\r\nprovided by history to build a secure foundation for a more\r\nstable and predictable world. This cannot be achieved by\r\nadvancing security systems towards the East or the West;\r\nit can be achieved only by advancing towards securing the\r\nmajor achievement of this century — the elimination of\r\nglobal confrontation.\r\nThis will create a situation in which the United\r\nNations is able to demonstrate the full measure of its\r\neffectiveness and, conversely, will prove to be the most\r\nappropriate and powerful tool of the international\r\ncommunity in achieving this goal and in managing the\r\nnumerous challenges that the twenty-first century holds in\r\nstore.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Georgia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alexander Chikvaidze, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Georgia, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Danny\r\nPhilip, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Honourable Danny\r\nPhilip, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Danny Philip,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Philip: This rostrum is a symbol of the reason\r\nwhy we are gathered here to celebrate the last 50 years,\r\nand the challenge to move into the future without fear.\r\nAmong the 50 countries that sent delegations to San\r\nFrancisco in April 1945 to adopt the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations were three from the Pacific region:\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and the Philippines. In the\r\nplenary meetings that opened the United Nations\r\nConference on International Organization the heads of\r\ndelegations spoke of their hopes for the United Nations\r\nand outlined the positions of their Governments on the\r\ndraft Charter.\r\nGeneral Carlos Romulo of the Philippines said:\r\n“We are here to fight for our lives. We are well\r\naware that international understanding must rest on\r\npractical security and that the economic structure of\r\nthe world must determine the balance between\r\nnations, but of more lasting importance is the\r\nspiritual structure .... Our aim must be tolerance, for\r\nvictory can be preserved only with tolerance.”\r\nThe Prime Minister of New Zealand, Peter Fraser, said:\r\n“The maintenance of peace is the paramount\r\nproblem that confronts us. This is a moral problem\r\nand not merely a mechanical one to be solved by\r\nprocedures, however carefully devised and\r\ncomprehensive their nature. ... I would plead most\r\nearnestly that the members of the new Organization\r\nshould seek international equity, both political and\r\neconomic.”\r\nAnd on the same occasion Australia’s Deputy Prime\r\nMinister, Francis Forde, said:\r\n“We take the view that peace and security must rest\r\non economic justice and social security. ... We\r\ncannot disentangle in our minds the idea of justice\r\nfrom that of peace.”\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHalf a century after representatives of our sister States\r\nin the Pacific gave voice to these ideas in San Francisco,\r\nthey are as fresh as if spoken today, and more relevant than\r\never. Building international peace and security based upon\r\npolitical and economic equity, fostering universal human\r\nrights supportive of cultural diversity and integrity,\r\nprotecting the environment and maintaining sustainable\r\ndevelopment — these are the ways in which we continue to\r\nfight for our lives through the United Nations. As the\r\nfounders of this Organization understood, our problems are\r\nultimately moral and spiritual in nature. Therefore, the very\r\nwork of diplomacy can be successful only in an atmosphere\r\nof tolerance.\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II recently said in this\r\nHall:\r\n“there is a moral logic which is built into human life\r\nand which makes possible dialogue between\r\nindividuals and peoples. (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n20th meeting, p. 3)\r\n“The United Nations needs to rise more and more\r\nabove the cold status of an administrative institution\r\nand become a moral centre where all the nations of\r\nthe world feel at home and develop a shared\r\nawareness of being, as it were, a family of nations. ...\r\nThe family is by nature a community based on mutual\r\ntrust, mutual support and sincere respect.” (ibid., p. 5)\r\nIn the course of the last five decades this Organization\r\ndid much to expand and strengthen the community of\r\nnations. In the Pacific, for example, the United Nations has\r\nbeen a critical factor in the emergence of independent\r\nStates. The recent international recognition of the\r\nvulnerability of small island developing States to adverse\r\neconomic conditions, as well as to natural and\r\nenvironmental disasters, is for us a significant example of\r\nthe family of nations building mutual trust, support and\r\nrespect.\r\nIn this spirit of community, the Solomon Islands\r\nproposes that, to assist the movement towards a universal\r\nUnited Nations, the fiftieth session of the General Assembly\r\nconsider and adopt a plan to bring into the Organization the\r\nseveral nations that have expressed their desire to become\r\nMember States but are as yet financially or politically\r\nunable to do so.\r\nAmong the ends for which “We the peoples” of the\r\nworld established the United Nations, as stated in the\r\nCharter, is\r\n“to practice tolerance and live together in peace with\r\none another as good neighbours”.\r\nThe Solomon Islands — an ethnically and linguistically\r\ndiverse, developing nation — believes that it is time to\r\nformulate an agenda for democracy and tolerance to\r\ncomplement “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”. Based upon the experience of the United\r\nNations system in assisting nations to nurture democratic\r\ninstitutions and tolerance, this new agenda will offer\r\nhumankind the goal of the spiritual security that is the\r\nessence of the objectives we seek in the Agendas for\r\npeace and development.\r\nSpiritual security is essential if the purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations, stated in Article 1 of the Charter, are to\r\nbe realized. Spiritual security is critical if the United\r\nNations is to be, in the words of the Charter.\r\n“a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations”\r\nin attaining peace, international cooperation and respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms. The\r\nproposed agenda for democracy and tolerance will be the\r\nvital link in the triad of Agendas, which will buttress the\r\nnew diplomacy that is emerging. People-centred, the new\r\ndiplomacy embraces the ideals of democracy, tolerance,\r\npeaceful coexistence, the rights of persons and peoples,\r\nequity and sustainable development.\r\nOn 14 February 1919, President Woodrow Wilson\r\ntold the Paris Peace Conference that, throughout the\r\nCovenant of the League of Nations:\r\n“We are depending primarily and chiefly upon one\r\ngreat force, and that is the moral force of the public\r\nopinion of the world — the cleansing and clarifying\r\nand compelling influences of publicity.”\r\nThe League of Nations failed to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity, but the moral force of public opinion, now\r\nquickly formed by nearly instant communications, is\r\npotentially enormous. We have experienced this at the\r\nUnited Nations. How to keep the new diplomacy —\r\npeople-centred development — responsive to the moral\r\nforce of public opinion is one of the greatest challenges\r\nfacing all the nations and the peoples of the world in the\r\ncenturies to come. Let us all hope and, with optimism for\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nthe future, instil greater positivity in the work of the United\r\nNations for greater achievement, as together we make a\r\nquantum leap into the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Solomon Islands for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Mr. Danny Philip,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Solomon Islands, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jacques F. Poos, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLuxembourg\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nJacques Poos, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Luxembourg.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacques F. Poos, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLuxembourg, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Poos (interpretation from French): We are\r\ngathered today to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nour Organization. In 1945, 51 countries, emerging from the\r\nmost devastating war that humanity had ever known, met\r\nat San Francisco to make a commitment to build together\r\na just and lasting peace.\r\nDetermined to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war, the international community wanted to\r\ncreate an organization that could prevent similar horrors in\r\nthe future by establishing the political, economic and social\r\nconditions of a new, more peaceful and safer world.\r\nThe great hopes placed in the United Nations were\r\nsoon tempered by the cold war, which divided the world\r\ninto two antagonistic military and ideological blocs. In spite\r\nof the ensuing paralysis, our Organization was able to\r\nensure relative stability by preventing the outbreak of a\r\nmajor conflagration and by limiting the scope and intensity\r\nof existing conflicts. It was able to lay down the principal\r\nguidelines that allowed it peacefully to settle difficult\r\nproblems and, in many cases, to substitute dialogue and\r\nnegotiation for armed hostility.\r\nAbove and beyond the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the United Nations created conditions\r\npropitious to considerable progress in many other sectors.\r\nThrough its activities, the United Nations improved the\r\nliving conditions of and offered sanctuary to hundreds of\r\nmillions of the disinherited and homeless. It helped to\r\neradicate infectious diseases and to reduce infant mortality\r\nthroughout the world. It is no coincidence that the first\r\nimportant text adopted by our Organization after the San\r\nFrancisco Conference was the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nThe end of the cold war ushered in a new era in\r\nwhich the search for lasting peace again seemed possible.\r\nYet, only a few years after this remarkable manifestation\r\nof hope, we are again plagued by doubt and uncertainty\r\nas to the ability of the international community to put an\r\nend to ever-increasing conflicts. In Europe, Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America, we see internal conflicts that are\r\ntearing States apart and complex crises in which political,\r\nmilitary and humanitarian elements are inextricably\r\nlinked.\r\nMoreover, threats of war of a very different kind\r\nhave emerged, confronting our Organization with new\r\nchallenges. These threats include international terrorism,\r\nthe proliferation of arms, drug trafficking and\r\nenvironmental degradation. The search for responses to\r\nthese threats can only be undertaken at the global level.\r\nThe United Nations alone has the authority and legitimacy\r\nto attempt to meet these challenges.\r\nLet us not make the United Nations a scapegoat for\r\nour own failings. It is not the United Nations that has\r\ndisappointed our hopes but we, the Member States, which\r\nhave not lived up to the ideals of our Organization and\r\ndeny it the political and financial means to fulfil the\r\nmandate we have entrusted to it.\r\nIf we wish to prepare our Organization for the next\r\n50 years of its existence, we must reform it so as to allow\r\nit to respond more effectively to the old challenges and\r\nthe new ones which we are facing. We must find an\r\nimmediate solution to the financial crisis, guarantee the\r\nbalanced expansion of the Security Council, develop\r\npreventive diplomacy and improve the organization of\r\npeace-keeping operations. In the economic and social\r\nfield, we must strengthen our capacity to promote\r\nsustainable development by merging organs and functions\r\nand creating an economic security council. These are the\r\nprincipal reforms we must institute.\r\nThe aspirations of the founding fathers of the United\r\nNations are as valid today as they were 50 years ago. The\r\nOrganization they handed down to us is a reflection of\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nour world, with all its imperfections and hopes. We must\r\nshow ourselves to be worthy of the enthusiasm which the\r\nOrganization continues to inspire in the peoples of the\r\nworld. Luxembourg will continue resolutely to support the\r\ncause of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacques F. Poos, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLuxembourg, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Galo Leoro, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ecuador\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nGalo Leoro, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Galo Leoro, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ecuador, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Leoro (interpretation from Spanish): On the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nEcuador wishes to stress the fact that, in accordance with\r\nthe lofty goals set out in the Charter, the world\r\nOrganization has achieved important successes, among\r\nwhich is the avoidance of a third world war that would\r\nhave entailed a nuclear holocaust for all humanity. On the\r\nother hand, there have been major failures in many areas,\r\nas witnessed by the persistence of serious problems, chiefly\r\ndue to the absence of a real desire for international\r\ncooperation.\r\nMany distinct conflicts have led to a significant loss\r\nof human life, unspeakable suffering, hunger and misery.\r\nSome of these have been resolved through United Nations\r\naction, while others have been settled through a variety of\r\nmechanisms outside our Organization. Serious problems\r\npersist, wreaking havoc at all levels.\r\nThe concept of peace and security which, in 1945, was\r\nunderstood mainly in the context of traditional military\r\nconcerns in the framework of collective security, has been\r\nappropriately expanded to embrace the political, economic\r\nand social conditions in which peoples live. State\r\nsovereignty is in the process of evolving, as is the very\r\ninstitution of the State. The promotion of democracy and\r\nthe defence and protection of human rights have become\r\nuniversal norms.\r\nNotwithstanding the failures and political and social\r\nchanges of recent years, the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations have survived intact, including the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\navoidance of resort to the threat or use of force against\r\nthe territorial integrity or political independence of any\r\nState and the obligation to settle international disputes by\r\nexclusively peaceful means, which entails the non-\r\nrecognition of territories acquired by force. The\r\nOrganization must also continue to strive to create the\r\nconditions of stability and well-being necessary for\r\npeaceful and friendly relations among nations, as well as\r\nthe promotion of conditions conducive to progress and\r\neconomic and social development for all.\r\nTo attend to the new and increasing demands being\r\nplaced upon it by the international community, our\r\nOrganization needs major structural change, adopted in\r\nkeeping with the obligations derived from its supreme\r\ninstrument, the Charter of San Francisco. Respect for the\r\nbinding nature of this fundamental universal instrument is\r\nthe only way to guarantee the survival of small and weak\r\ncountries. Ecuador continues to be a firm supporter of the\r\nrule of law on the basis of the immutable principles of\r\njustice. Thus do we reaffirm our commitment to pursuing\r\nthe ongoing quest for just and equitable solutions, arising\r\nfrom agreements mutually arrived at, to the conflicts that\r\npersist in the world, and particularly in our region.\r\nWe therefore applaud your statement, Mr. President,\r\nin welcoming His Holiness Pope John Paul II to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, when you said:\r\n“that for the ideals of peace and fraternity to take\r\nroot deeply among men they must be based on\r\neconomic, social and cultural development as well as\r\non the primacy of justice.”(Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 20th meeting, p. 1)\r\nEcuador likewise embraces with enthusiasm the challenge\r\nof the Pontiff to overcome our fear of the future and to\r\ndo so together through\r\n“the common effort to build a civilization of love,\r\nfounded on the universal values of peace, solidarity,\r\njustice and liberty.” (ibid., p. 6)\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ecuador for his statement.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Galo Leoro Franco, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ecuador, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Kozo Zoumanigui,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea\r\nThe President: The assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Kozo Zoumanigui,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kozo Zoumanigui, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Guinea, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Zoumanigui (interpretation from French): Allow\r\nme to transmit to the General Assembly the heartfelt\r\ngreetings of the people, the Government and General\r\nLansana Conté, President of the Republic of Guinea, from\r\nwhom I have the honour and the privilege to convey this\r\nmessage of solidarity:\r\n“Leaders of the world, I should like at the very\r\noutset to thank His Excellency the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali, for the invitation he so kindly\r\naddressed to us. We also express our thanks to all\r\nthose who have organized this anniversary celebration,\r\nwhich is such a resounding success.\r\n“Having discharged this duty, I should like to\r\nstate that it is a genuine pleasure for me, on behalf of\r\nthe Government of Guinea and on my own personal\r\nbehalf, on this happy occasion of the commemoration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, to be\r\nable from this lofty rostrum to deliver to you not only\r\na message of peace, friendship and the solidarity of\r\nthe people of Guinea towards the peoples of the entire\r\nworld, but, indeed, also one of hope, confidence and\r\nunbreakable faith in the United Nations and in the\r\npurposes and principles embodied in its Charter.\r\n“I take pleasure, finally, in paying a warm tribute\r\nto the achievement of the founding fathers, and to the\r\nsingular distinction with which His Excellency the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations is managing\r\naffairs at the global level.\r\n“In attempting to take stock of the 50 years of\r\nour Organization’s existence, I think it can be said that\r\nover this last half-century the United Nations has\r\nproved irreplaceable, unique as a tool for dialogue, a\r\nconcerted approach, negotiation and international\r\ncooperation. Through all these years, it has provided\r\nthe ideal framework and laboured tirelessly not only\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, but also to mobilize the international\r\ncommunity towards a solution of the problems of the\r\nworld’s economic and social development.\r\n“The international political scene has over the\r\nlast several years witnessed unprecedented change.\r\nOne of the consequences of this profound\r\ndevelopment has been the emergence of new\r\nchallenges, whose diversity and complexity are\r\nmatched only by their urgency. Suddenly, the\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations have grown\r\nconsiderably, its tasks multiplied, as it initiates,\r\ndevelops and consolidates new strategies designed to\r\nenhance the well-being of us all while ensuring a\r\nbetter future for generations to come.\r\n“While our Organization has, certain setbacks\r\nnotwithstanding, distinguished itself in its principle\r\nrealm of competence, namely, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, its talent and\r\ncapacity for responding promptly and effectively to\r\nthe many demands placed upon it from around the\r\nworld are still being sorely put to the test by the\r\nmultiplicity of conflicts and other hotbeds of tension\r\nand, in particular, because of the weight of the\r\nburden of peace-keeping operations.\r\n“Therefore, to be able to continue effectively\r\nand fully to play its role, the United Nations needs\r\nto be reinforced and to be given resources\r\ncommensurate with the expectations of mankind.\r\nAgainst that background, the issuance of “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment” is particularly apposite at the end of\r\nthis century. The international community is duty\r\nbound resolutely and steadfastly to support those\r\ndocuments.\r\n“The direct nexus between peace and security\r\non the one hand, and economic and social\r\ndevelopment on the other needs no further proof.\r\nAfter all, what do we observe today, if not that our\r\nworld is chiefly characterized by inequalities,\r\nflagrant disparities and imbalances in the way wealth\r\nand resources are allocated?\r\n“To cope with all this, mankind needs a new\r\nvision of its future, one which rests on the central\r\nidea of the role to be played by the United Nations\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nin meeting the economic and social challenges we are\r\nfacing.\r\n“Peoples of the world, over the last five decades\r\nwe have together thwarted the most diabolical designs\r\nand conquered the most abject kinds of discrimination.\r\nTogether we must overcome, through our\r\nOrganization, all the forms of exclusion — all are\r\ninadmissible — that afflict groups of men and women,\r\nof countries, indeed, of entire regions of the world.\r\n“The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nwhich we are commemorating today quite rightly\r\naffords us the opportunity to stop and reflect together\r\non the new role to be given to this Organization. Let\r\nthis anniversary give mankind the chance to bestow\r\nupon itself a still stronger institution, driven by a spirit\r\nof solidarity, of fruitful cooperation, capable of\r\nmobilizing the means and the resources necessary to\r\nmeet the challenges before us — challenges such as\r\nmaintaining international peace and security in the\r\nworld and achieving economic and social\r\ndevelopment, justice, democracy and equality.\r\n“Long live the United Nations!”\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Guinea for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kozo Zoumanigui, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Guinea, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ablassé Ouédraogo,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Ablassé Ouédraogo,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ablassé Ouédraogo, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Burkina Faso, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Ouédraogo (interpretation from French): The\r\nUnited Nations is 50 years old. But we have only five\r\nminutes to speak of these 50 years and of the future. That\r\nis the price of success for an Organization that is truly\r\nglobal.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations is hailed and\r\nrevered; yet the world could be in much better health.\r\nIf mankind does not improve, we cannot benefit\r\nfrom institutions, no matter how good they may be.\r\nRavaged by conflicts, epidemics and natural\r\ndisasters, our world today is suffering from an even\r\ngreater evil. That evil is at the root of what is tearing us\r\napart, crucifying us and destroying us.\r\nOpenness to others is disregarded. Indifference and\r\nself-absorption are today among the greatest dangers\r\nfacing humanity. The spirit and philosophy of the times\r\ndemonstrate the tendency to think that, these days, “the\r\nothers” are the homeless, refugees, street children,\r\nimmigrants, the poor, rivals, adversaries, enemies, those\r\nwho are different, foreigners. “The others” have become\r\nthose that one seeks to avoid.\r\nAnd yet these last 50 years have witnessed striking\r\nand considerable manifestations of solidarity on the part\r\nof man towards his fellow man. But these have become\r\neroded or have faded, finally giving rise to a vexing and\r\ndevastating concept: donor fatigue.\r\nBut in a healthy relationship, what is a man if he\r\nknows not how to give? What is a man if he knows not\r\nhow to receive? Does it not call for a review of the\r\nsituation as soon as possible when it is always the same\r\nones who give and the same ones who receive? Is this not\r\nan indication that injustice has become built into the\r\nstructure of today’s world?\r\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, above\r\nand beyond the theory of States and of sovereignty,\r\nbeyond the relationship of force, beyond the ambitions of\r\ndomination, should we not substitute people, societies,\r\nnations, States? Should we not give new impetus to what\r\nwas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations in the\r\nwords “We the peoples”, and find again the human being\r\nand the humanity in each and every one of us and in each\r\nand every one of our acts?\r\nOnly then will we progress with certainty towards a\r\nworld of solidarity, a world of progress, a world of justice\r\nand a world of peace.\r\nThat is the five-minute message that Burkina Faso\r\nwished to convey on the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Burkina Faso for his statement.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Burkina Faso, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Edgar Camacho Omiste,\r\nChairman of the delegation of Bolivia\r\nThe President: I call next on Mr. Edgar Camacho\r\nOmiste, Chairman of the delegation of Bolivia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Edgar Camacho Omiste,\r\nChairman of the delegation of Bolivia, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Camacho Omiste (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nSpecial and unforeseen circumstances have prevented the\r\nattendance of His Excellency the President of the Republic\r\nof Bolivia, Mr. Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, on this\r\noccasion. I am charged, therefore, with the very important\r\nduty of paying this tribute to the United Nations and of\r\nconveying the cordial greetings of the Head of State of\r\nBolivia to Their Excellencies the Heads of State and of\r\nGovernment of the world, to you, Mr. President, and to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nFor Bolivia, this solemn ceremony symbolizes an act\r\nof faith in the capacity of human beings to live together in\r\nharmony. It represents a renewal of our commitment to\r\nwork in the conviction that freedom and equality will\r\nprevail on this Earth.\r\nIn Bolivia we remember with admiration the ability\r\nand vision of those distinguished figures who laid the\r\nfoundations of the United Nations, and we pay special\r\ntribute to our fellow countrymen who attended the historic\r\nSan Francisco Conference, under the guidance of the then\r\nPresident of our Republic, Colonel Gualberto Villaroel.\r\nThe contribution of the Bolivian delegates to that\r\ndebate was particularly important. Therefore, 50 years later,\r\nwe reiterate the conviction that lasting peace on Earth\r\nrequires justice in international relations and within each\r\ncountry.\r\nOur delegates maintained that, if harmony were to\r\nprevail among nations, solutions had to be found to\r\nsituations that impeded fraternal relations among peoples.\r\nJustice alone will be the foundation of a true peace.\r\nSome day in the not-too-distant future there will be an\r\nend to situations of oppression and dependency, just as\r\ncolonialism will come to an end, extreme poverty will\r\ndisappear, friendship among peoples will flourish, and the\r\nfree and sovereign presence of Bolivia on the Pacific\r\nOcean will become possible.\r\nThe power politics of yesterday will have to give\r\nway to brotherhood and cooperation as central instruments\r\nin the new international relations.\r\nBolivia encourages friendship among countries and\r\ncalls for cooperation based on dignity, sovereign equality,\r\nrespect for diversity, and understanding of the needs and\r\nlegitimate concerns of peoples.\r\nGood-neighbourly relations require not only sincerity\r\non the part of all, but, most particularly, respect for others\r\nand the desire to contribute to the welfare of our brotherly\r\npeoples, to raise standards of living, to promote job\r\nopportunities and to achieve specific goals in the areas of\r\nhealth, education and housing, while improving access to\r\nfinancing, technology and world markets.\r\nOn the basis of these principles, all countries will be\r\nactive members of the world community, capable of\r\nmaking sustainable development possible, of capitalizing\r\nand creating enterprises to respond to the challenges of\r\nthe day, of eradicating consumption of and trafficking in\r\nharmful substances, of releasing humankind from the\r\narms race and the nuclear threat, of consolidating political\r\nstability and participatory democracy, of respecting\r\ncultural and ethnic diversity, and of creating real\r\nconditions for all men and women, the elderly, the youth\r\nand children — to live in a better world of true solidarity.\r\nThus, the agenda of the United Nations for the years\r\nto come has been spelt out. The Government of Bolivia,\r\ntogether with the other countries of the Rio Group, the\r\nIbero-American countries and the countries of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, believes that our next duties include\r\nconvening an international conference against the abuse\r\nand illegal trafficking of drugs, the objective of which\r\nwould be to strengthen the fight against drugs, thus\r\ntranslating the policies of the 1988 Vienna Conference\r\ninto reality.\r\nWe in Bolivia have learned that stagnation corrodes\r\ninstitutions and paralyses ideologies, while change is a\r\nwellspring of life and the key to social change. Thus, to\r\nprotect the worldly and spiritual heritage of nations, we\r\nmust change attitudes, discover new dimensions of\r\ndevelopment, modify the international system, and adopt\r\ndynamic forms of cooperation, tolerance and universal\r\nunderstanding. We must also strengthen the role of the\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nGeneral Assembly, make the Security Council more\r\neffective and representative, confer effective authority on\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and ensure that law will\r\nbe the instrument by which international justice is secured.\r\nIn Bolivia we are building a multicultural and\r\nmultilingual country across our Andean highlands and our\r\nplains; our country is preparing honourably to fulfil its role\r\nin the universal community of the future.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the delegation\r\nof Bolivia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Edgar Camacho Omiste,\r\nChairman of the delegation of Bolivia, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Hamid Algabid,\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I call next upon His Excellency Mr.\r\nHamid Algabid, Secretary-General of the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hamid Algabid, Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Algabid (interpretation from French): Half a\r\ncentury ago, the world, rising from the ruins of two\r\ndevastating world wars and from the horror and pain they\r\ncaused, took the measure of outrages that had reached the\r\nheight of inhumanity. It saw that war, the occupation of the\r\nterritory of others, aggression and the denial of the national\r\nrights of peoples were no longer profitable and could no\r\nlonger be accepted. Thus, when the United Nations was\r\nfounded at San Francisco in 1945, the desire was to make\r\ndiplomacy and negotiation the preferred tools for settling\r\ndisputes, conflicts and crises.\r\nThe imperative need to preserve peace and save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war demands\r\nadherence to universally recognized principles and a firm\r\ndetermination to defend law and legality wherever they are\r\nunder threat. Here, the United Nations has done remarkable\r\nwork. Similarly, inspiring work has been done by the entire\r\nUnited Nations system in the areas of development, culture,\r\nhealth, and social and humanitarian affairs in all regions,\r\nincluding in the Islamic world.\r\nIn speaking of these important accomplishments, I\r\nwant to take the opportunity afforded by this celebration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations humbly\r\nand gratefully to honour the memory of all those, now\r\ndeparted, who so generously laboured to create this\r\nOrganization. I address my heartfelt congratulations also\r\nto those who continue to serve it with courage and\r\ndedication, including, first and foremost, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros-Ghali.\r\nNotwithstanding the sustained efforts of the world\r\ncommunity, hotbeds of tension and conflict have once\r\nagain appeared in many places. Some recall in their\r\natrocities the darkest days of human history. Moreover,\r\nharsh challenges face the contemporary world: poverty,\r\nhunger, disease, illiteracy, underdevelopment, terrorism in\r\nall its forms and in its indiscriminate association with\r\nvarious faiths, the unbridled arms race, and the threats to\r\nour environment. All of these challenges demand genuine\r\ninitiative and an unswerving determination to give\r\nconcrete form to solidarity and thus to give common\r\ninterests precedence over individual interests.\r\nSupport for the ideal of democracy and the quest for\r\nbetter understanding among peoples can succeed only\r\nthrough greater cultural interaction and productive\r\nspiritual relationships marked by a spirit of openness,\r\ndialogue and tolerance.\r\nMr. Moubarak (Lebanon), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIn this connection, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\r\nwhich are so similar in their principles and purposes, has\r\ncontributed to creating conditions conducive to dialogue\r\nand harmony among peoples and nations.\r\nSince the outbreak of the crisis in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nhas worked hand-in-hand with the international\r\ncommunity in its efforts to ensure that law, justice, moral\r\nvalues and democratic principles prevail. I want to hail\r\nthe dynamic cooperation, which has grown recently,\r\nbetween the international Contact Group on Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the Contact Group of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference.\r\nThe same is true for the Middle East peace\r\nprocess — concerning which the agreements recently\r\nsigned at Washington have justified hopes for a just and\r\nlasting settlement of the question of Palestine, Al-Quds\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nAl-Sharif and the Syrian Golan — and for the fratricidal\r\nwars in Afghanistan, Somalia and Tajikistan, where the\r\nefforts of both organizations in so many spheres continue\r\nand grow stronger.\r\nThe actions of the international community would gain\r\nin breadth if more were done to eliminate the tension\r\ncreated by the conflicts regarding Jammu and Kashmir and\r\nNagorny Karabakh, and by the question of Cyprus.\r\nFinally, cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference in the\r\neconomic, cultural and humanitarian arenas is beginning to\r\nshow promising signs. It is with this promise of partnership\r\nfor peace and for development that I extend best wishes to\r\nthe United Nations on the threshold of the third millennium\r\nfor success in the achievement of its noble mission in the\r\nservice of peace and progress.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hamid Algabid, Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Count Carlo Marullo di\r\nCondojanni, Member of the Sovereign Council of the\r\nSovereign Military Order of Malta\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I call next upon His\r\nExcellency Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni, Member of\r\nthe Sovereign Council of the Sovereign Military Order of\r\nMalta.\r\nHis Excellency Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni,\r\nMember of the Sovereign Council of the Sovereign\r\nMilitary Order of Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Marullo di Condojanni (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On the happy occasion of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, I am honoured to extend to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the greetings of the Sovereign Military\r\nOrder of Malta and of its Prince and Grand Master Frà\r\nAndrew Bertie. Our institution has been a Permanent\r\nObserver to the General Assembly for over a year, but has\r\nbeen a part of the international community for centuries.\r\nWe are, therefore, in a good position to understand, with all\r\nthe peoples around the world, the importance of today’s\r\ncommemoration, to applaud the progress that has been\r\nmade and to join in efforts to ensure that the principles of\r\nthe Charter are brought fully to life.\r\nThe inception of the United Nations 50 years ago,\r\nheralded the hopes for a new era of peace and well-being\r\naround the world. The aim was to leave behind us a war\r\nin which the atrocities were on a scale previously\r\nunknown to mankind, a war that, with the introduction of\r\nnuclear weapons, had convinced peoples and\r\nGovernments that they had to seek peace at any price.\r\nToday, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the\r\nend of the cold war, hopes for worldwide and lasting\r\npeace seem to be slightly closer to realization, and it is a\r\nprivilege for me to express to the General Assembly the\r\nwish of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to see\r\nresolute and effective commitment in the community of\r\nnations.\r\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which was\r\nestablished about nine centuries ago in Jerusalem, is now\r\nbased in Rome. It maintains diplomatic relations at the\r\nlevel of Ambassador with 68 Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations, which is more than one-third of its\r\ncurrent membership. That alone explains the position of\r\nthe Order in the international community, whose members\r\nrecognize it as a par inter pares.\r\nToday the flag of the Order flies over specialized\r\nhospitals, clinics, first-aid posts and dispensaries that\r\nprovide assistance throughout the world to children, the\r\naged, the handicapped or those suffering from chronic\r\ndiseases. These structures provide medical and\r\npharmaceutical attention in places where epidemics are at\r\ntheir height. Quite recently, we agreed to contribute to the\r\nBlue Helmets in Lebanon and Kuwait, as we have done\r\nin the past in Central America. Furthermore, in 1989 the\r\nOrder provided assistance to thousand of refugees in East\r\nGermany who were travelling to West Germany through\r\nHungary and Austria. The Order was also one of the first\r\nto provide humanitarian assistance in the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nThe Order sees humanitarian assistance as a way to\r\nsafeguard fundamental human rights and, as such, as an\r\nessential tool in helping to guarantee the international\r\npeace and security that political, military and diplomatic\r\naction needs if it is to be able to establish an international\r\norder worthy of man. Inspired by these values, the\r\nSovereign Military Order of Malta, thanks to its political\r\nneutrality and supranational character, can help to pacify\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nand mediate, at the same time as ensuring respect for\r\ndialogue and understanding among peoples.\r\nThe values and purposes of our Order fit well with\r\nArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, and as a\r\nPermanent Observer the Order is fully available to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations, particularly in the field\r\nof humanitarian assistance. In particular, the Order is ready\r\nto make itself available to find ways to provide medical\r\nassistance in support of peace-keeping operations.\r\nWith these observations in mind, the people of the\r\nOrder of Malta join all the peoples of the United Nations in\r\ntoday’s celebration and in their commitment to cooperate in\r\nefforts to improve the efficiency of the implementation of\r\nthe purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express the hope that the\r\nbeginning of the second 50 years of the existence of the\r\nUnited Nations will — with the help of the Almighty —\r\nusher in the dawn of a new era for future generations. I\r\ntrust that the United Nations will indeed increasingly be\r\nable to live up to the aspirations of the people to peace,\r\nwell-being, social progress and the solidarity of all peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Member of the\r\nSovereign Council of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta\r\nfor his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Count Marullo di Condojanni, Member\r\nof the Sovereign Council of the Sovereign Military\r\nOrder of Malta, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. James N. Purcell, Director-General of\r\nthe International Organization for Migration\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I call on Mr. James Purcell,\r\nDirector-General of the International Organization for\r\nMigration.\r\nMr. James N. Purcell, Director-General of the\r\nInternational Organization for Migration, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Purcell: On the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, I am honoured that the\r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) can share\r\nin this truly historic event. IOM, the organization I\r\nrepresent, was created as an intergovernmental organization\r\nnearly 45 years ago by concerned States that were\r\nconvinced that individuals, economies and societies would\r\nall benefit from orderly responses to migration. IOM has\r\nsteadily grown since then and is currently composed of 96\r\nmember and observer States. These States, representing\r\nall regions of the world, ensure a global character in our\r\napproach to today’s migration issues.\r\nIn responding to global migration needs, IOM not\r\nonly offers technical assistance to States and facilitates\r\nthe orderly and planned migration of nationals, but also\r\nhas a history of reacting quickly in situations that require\r\nthe timely movement of large numbers of vulnerable\r\npersons, such as in the Gulf States in 1992 and more\r\nrecently in various parts of Africa, the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS), and elsewhere. Since our\r\nfounding, we have worked in close cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations system. I am pleased to say that the links\r\nbetween IOM and the United Nations are strong and\r\ngetting stronger, especially over the course of the past\r\nthree years since IOM became an Observer of the\r\nsessions and work of the General Assembly.\r\nOne frequently hears that the world is becoming ever\r\nmore complex. Certainly, the range of global issues with\r\nwhich the international community is grappling reflects\r\nthis increasing complexity: human rights, population,\r\npoverty, public health, environmental degradation,\r\neconomic and social development, ethnic conflicts and\r\nsecurity issues. Migration sits at the confluence of most\r\nof these issues, and in many ways can be viewed as one\r\nof the major consequences of the failure to date to deal\r\nadequately with their destabilizing aspects.\r\nHow the world and the international community\r\nrespond to migration and migratory pressures is of critical\r\nimportance to global stability and well-being. Once\r\nconsidered primarily as a positive force in nation-building,\r\nmigrants are now, more often than not, seen as the visible\r\nmessengers of society’s failures. When migrants move\r\nwithout legal means, as many do, and are stopped, as\r\nmany are, they severely overburden national systems no\r\nlonger structured or financed to deal with them humanely\r\nand effectively.\r\nA comprehensive framework which views the\r\nmigration phenomenon in its entirety, beginning with\r\nsolutions to root causes, is what is required in today’s\r\ncomplex world. IOM, with its operational and policy-\r\nbased migration mandate, can be a key resource in\r\nhelping to explore comprehensive solutions.\r\nIOM can do this, however, only in close partnership\r\nwith the United Nations, which has a critical role to play\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nin the resolution of the great issues of our day, including\r\nmigration.\r\nI would, however, submit that our pursuit of\r\ncomprehensive solutions will not require a new or more\r\ncomplex international system. Instead, joint efforts on such\r\nkey issues as migration, which require each member of the\r\nextended international family to effectively play its own\r\nrole in relation to its own mandate, are the only realistic\r\nresponse. Any examination of the role and structure of\r\norganizations must provide support for collaborative\r\nmechanisms which draw on the strengths of all entities,\r\nboth inside and outside the United Nations.\r\nIOM is eager to contribute to solving some of these\r\npressing issues, building particularly on our growing\r\nassociation with the United Nations. We see numerous\r\nopportunities for strengthening the ties that can and must\r\nbind us closer together. I am confident that the good offices\r\nof all concerned in putting in train forward-looking\r\napproaches will help ensure even greater success for the\r\nUnited Nations in the next 50 years.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Director-General\r\nof the International Organization for Migration for his\r\nstatement.\r\nMr. James N. Purcell, Director-General of the\r\nInternational Organization, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga, President of the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I call on the next speaker,\r\nMr. Cornelio Sommaruga, President of the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross.\r\nMr. Cornelio Sommaruga, President of the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Sommaruga (interpretation from French):\r\nAbounding in symbolism, the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations invites us to ponder\r\nhistory. The International Committee of the Red Cross\r\n(ICRC) is therefore pleased to join in this moment which\r\nenables it to reaffirm its faith in mankind by paying tribute\r\nto an institution moulded in its image — imperfect, unique,\r\nyet irreplaceable.\r\nEntirely different in terms of their nature and\r\nobjectives, the United Nations and the ICRC are\r\nnevertheless based on the same humanistic philosophy:\r\nfor the United Nations in 1945 as for the ICRC in 1864\r\nand in 1949, it was a question of vanquishing the demons\r\nof war in the aftermath of lethal and devastating conflicts\r\nby striving to building a universality of values which\r\nunite and unify.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva\r\nConventions of 1949 relative to the protection of victims\r\nof war, adopted in the wake of the Second World War,\r\ntoday are the common heritage of humanity. The drafters\r\nof these instruments demonstrated great lucidity, aware as\r\nthey were that it was an illusion to think that war could\r\nbe banned, so the two actions were completely distinct\r\nand have remained so.\r\nIn the past 50 years these universal instruments have\r\nstood unchallenged. It is remarkable, in fact, to note that\r\nthe new Member States adhered both to the spirit of\r\nGeneva and the spirit of San Francisco, and have even\r\ndeepened it.\r\nWhile there exists today a consensus regarding\r\nvalues, making them a reality is still a daily challenge.\r\nSince 1945, over 120 conflicts have produced some 22\r\nmillion victims and continue to inflict untold suffering.\r\nThe proclaimed dedication to human rights is only\r\nequalled by the scorn that these rights are subjected to. In\r\nthe face of this paradox, the ICRC, whose humanitarian\r\naction has grown considerably, would like here above all\r\nto be the spokesman of countless victims of armed\r\nconflicts, whether they are on the front page or forgotten.\r\nBut does not everyone share in the responsibility, the\r\npolitical responsibility of States, the responsibility of\r\ninstitutions, the responsibility of individuals?\r\nSaving human beings in emergencies calls for a\r\nrapid humanitarian response, independent of any other\r\ntype of\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 22 October 1995\r\nconsideration, if it is to attain its immediate objective,\r\nwhich is to help and protect. Of course, this is a limited,\r\nalthough indispensable, type of response. Evils must be\r\nprevented by attacking them at their root. The United\r\nNations has continuously worked in this direction by\r\ncreating the necessary conditions for the enjoyment of\r\nfundamental human rights. Political action remains a key\r\nelement in the prevention of crises, the responsibility for\r\nwhich rests with States. Similarly, it is States, both\r\nindividually and collectively through the United Nations,\r\nwhose task it is to ensure respect for the provisions of\r\ninternational law, inter alia, the Geneva Conventions. It\r\nseems to me essential that the United Nations achieve\r\nprogress in the establishment of a permanent international\r\ncriminal court.\r\nBut a culture of tolerance and solidarity, of respect for\r\nminorities and of respect, quite simply, for others also\r\ndepends upon individual attitudes to a large extent. The Red\r\nCross, faithful to its fundamental principles, wishes to make\r\na basic contribution to that end.\r\nMore frequent, deadly destabilizing crises confront us\r\nwith unprecedented challenges. It is urgent to reject the idea\r\nthat regression is inevitable. Combating intolerance, the\r\nneed to respect human dignity in all circumstances, compels\r\nus to form a common front at all times.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross for his statement.\r\nMr. Cornelio Sommaruga, President of the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: Before adjourning the meeting,\r\nI should like to appeal to representatives to be punctual\r\ntomorrow because the President intends to start our work at\r\n10 a.m. sharp.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.15 p.m.\r\n40\r\n"
