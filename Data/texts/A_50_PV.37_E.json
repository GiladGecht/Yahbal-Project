(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 29 (continued)\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations\r\nThe President: This morning we hold the third\r\nmeeting of the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nBefore I call on the first speaker I should like to draw\r\nthe attention of members to the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations, document A/50/48. The draft resolution which\r\nappears in paragraph 2 of the report contains the\r\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI am glad that yesterday we were able to complete\r\nwork on time and I should like to remind all delegations\r\nagain of the five-minute limit for each statement.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta\r\nMuseveni, President of the Republic of Uganda\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Museveni: I tried to see whether I could\r\nread my statement in the stipulated five minutes and I\r\nfound that I could not, so I have decided to summarize it\r\ninstead of attempting to read it and breaking the rule.\r\nFirst I wish to inform the Assembly that about nine\r\nmonths ago I was invited to Buenos Aires to address a\r\nseminar. The topic I was given to speak on was “Does\r\nAfrica Matter?” That means that in the minds of some\r\npeople the question whether Africa matters is being\r\nraised. Of course Africa matters. Africa covers an area of\r\n30 million square kilometres. It is the second largest\r\ncontinent in the world. It now has 700 million people.\r\nObviously it matters.\r\nThe reason some people are wondering why Africa\r\nmatters is because of the backwardness of its economies\r\nand population. The main reason for that backwardness is\r\nthe structure of society. I recently carried out a study and\r\nfound that in the United Kingdom 52 per cent of the\r\npeople are members of the middle class; 46 per cent of\r\nthe people in the United Kingdom are members of the\r\nskilled working class; 2 per cent of the people are what\r\nis called the upper class — which I think means the\r\naristocracy.\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nWhat is the picture in Uganda? In Uganda 92 per cent\r\nof the people are peasants. The characteristic of peasant\r\nsocieties is that, first, they are parochial and, secondly, they\r\nbase themselves on a subsistence economy. A characteristic\r\nof middle-class societies is that the middle class is the most\r\nenterprising social group in the history of man. Therefore\r\nthe absence of the middle class in Uganda — and I\r\npresume in other African countries — is the source of the\r\nmany problems we have in Africa.\r\nWho caused this social distortion? Why is it that in the\r\nUnited Kingdom 52 per cent of the people are members of\r\nthe middle class and there are no peasants? There are no\r\nlonger any peasants in Europe. There were peasants in\r\nEurope 300 years ago. By the time of the French\r\nRevolution the peasant class was a strong class in Europe.\r\nWhat happened? Why is it that in Europe there is no longer\r\na peasant class yet in Africa the peasant class is the\r\ndominant class? What are the reasons?\r\nThe main culprit is colonialism, because colonialism\r\nstopped the emergence of the middle class. Yet the middle\r\nclass is a cosmopolitan-minded group. It consists of people\r\nwho think about the whole world because these people are\r\nbusinessmen. They want to do business in the whole world.\r\nTherefore, when Africa is deficient in a middle class it\r\nmeans it is deficient in entrepreneurship and cosmopolitan\r\nideas.\r\nWhat do we do to redress the situation? There are five\r\npoints to which we are addressing ourselves in Uganda.\r\nFirst, democratic governance — to have democracy;\r\nsecondly, a liberalized economy, an economy that makes it\r\neasy for people to do business; thirdly, universal and\r\ncompulsory education — sending everybody to school\r\nwhether or not they want to go to school; fourthly,\r\nexpanding the infrastructure — especially roads and power\r\nso that those who are doing business have the means to\r\ntake their products to the markets; and, fifthly, regional\r\nintegration — which means the integration of markets\r\nbecause one cannot produce unless there are markets to\r\nabsorb what one produces.\r\nThose are the five points that we in Uganda propose\r\nin order to eliminate the bottleneck of having a society\r\nwithout the very modern force that has been responsible for\r\ndevelopment in other areas, that is, a middle class.\r\nI have been hearing talk that apart from wondering\r\nwhether or not Africa matters, people are worried that\r\nAfrica is being marginalized. When I ask, “What do you\r\nmean by saying that Africa is being marginalized?”, they\r\nsay that Africa is being forgotten by Europe. I am not\r\nworried about that. Africa will develop whether or not\r\nEurope’s forgets Africa. It is my opinion that our\r\ndevelopment does not depend on Europe’s remembering\r\nus. It does not matter if we are forgotten or marginalized\r\nbut if members read my short statement they will see that\r\nit is crucial that we in Africa solve these bottleneck\r\nproblems and the endogenous factors — the factors within\r\nAfrica that have stopped us from developing. The\r\nexogenous factors, those from outside Africa, are only\r\nsecondary, not primary.\r\nEven if we get aid from the West, if we do not solve\r\nthese internal bottlenecks and endogenous factors within\r\nour own countries there will be no development. On the\r\nother hand, even if we do not get any help, provided we\r\nsolve the endogenous bottlenecks I am sure we shall\r\ndevelop.\r\nDoes that mean that Europe should not help us? No,\r\nEurope should help us. First, the Europeans owe us debts.\r\nThey caused us many problems. They came and\r\nplundered our economies. They used our economies to\r\nbuild themselves up so it is a moral requirement that\r\nEurope should help us if only to pay for past mistakes.\r\nBut in the case of Uganda we will develop, it is in\r\nour hands and does not depend on whether or not they\r\nhelp us. That is why we fought for freedom. We now\r\nhave freedom and we will develop one way or any other.\r\nI come now to the United Nations. I commend the\r\nUnited Nations for maintaining peace over the past 50\r\nyears but it has been doing so without resources.\r\nTherefore I appeal to States that owe money to the United\r\nNations to pay up. I was looking at the list and found that\r\nUganda was not so bad when it came to paying its dues\r\nto the United Nations but it is important that the more\r\npowerful States should pay their United Nations dues.\r\nHowever there is one problem I have found in\r\nUnited Nations programmes. It seems that we do not\r\nclearly define the circumstances in which the United\r\nNations should be involved.\r\nIn the case of Haiti, it was easy for the United States\r\nto come in and support the legitimate authorities to\r\nassume power. But when the United Nations went into\r\nSomalia, who was the legal force there and who the\r\nillegal force? As far as I am concerned, all the groups in\r\nSomalia were illegal. There were groups that had emerged\r\nas a result of an explosion that was a consequence of long\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nperiods of disenfranchisement of the people. In such a\r\nsituation, who is the good boy and who is the bad boy? We\r\nmust be very careful there.\r\nThat is why in such a situation I would rather\r\nconcentrate on reconciliation, which would give us an\r\ninterim Government. Then we could have elections in order\r\nto re-establish legitimacy, and then we could support the\r\nlegitimate force. But simply coming in as we did in\r\nSomalia, I think, was a mistake in the first instance. We\r\njust came in and tried to take sides with one of the groups\r\nwhen, in fact, all of the groups were illegitimate.\r\nIn some other situations we have had elections on the\r\nbasis of one man, one vote. This is a good beginning.\r\nHowever, one needs to be very careful, because if the\r\nprinciple of one man, one vote is on a sectarian basis, what\r\nyou will get is a majority Government that is not\r\nnecessarily a national Government, but a Government of\r\njust one of the sectors. And if you simply back it without\r\nlooking closely at the problems, you may find that you are\r\nbacking a sectarian majority in an effort to monopolize\r\npower. So I think that there you need a little flexibility.\r\nTherefore, finally, one of the remedies we have\r\napplied in Uganda is always having a broad-based\r\nGovernment. In Uganda we do not believe in the principle\r\nof winner-take-all. Our country was torn apart by criminals\r\nsuch as Idi Amin, but when we came in we were able to\r\nput our country together by using the formula of everybody\r\nbeing in power instead of some people being in power and\r\nothers out.\r\nEveryone must have heard about the bad situation in\r\nRwanda. Uganda had suffered similarly. When such\r\nproblems arise in Africa, I am sure many people in Europe\r\nthink to themselves that this is African barbarism. When\r\nthey see children being massacred and women being\r\nslaughtered, I think that people in the world thin to\r\nthemselves that this is African barbarism. But I would like\r\nto end my short speech here by saying that this is not so.\r\nBefore colonialism, we used to have tribal wars. I can say\r\nthat in spite of those wars, women, children and captives\r\nwere never killed. Africans do not kill women. When there\r\nare too many women, you marry them — you have three,\r\nfour, five or six wives. You do not kill them. I have never\r\nseen an African killing a woman. So this phenomenon of\r\nkilling women and children is not African barbarism. It is\r\nanother kind of barbarism: a barbarism created by the\r\nconfluence of some foreign meddlers in our affairs with\r\nsome local traitors. They are the ones who kill women,\r\nchildren and captives. Africans do not kill women and\r\nchildren.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Uganda for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire, President\r\nof the Republic of Botswana.\r\nHis Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire, President of the\r\nRepublic of Botswana, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Masire: Botswana congratulates Portugal\r\non its assumption of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fiftieth session. We salute the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his inspiring stewardship of the United\r\nNations at this critical moment in its history.\r\nThe presence of so many world leaders in New York\r\nbears witness to the success of the United Nations during\r\nits half century of existence. For Botswana and the\r\nAfrican continent, this is a particularly historic moment.\r\nWhen the Organization was born in San Francisco in\r\n1945, only four African countries were able to adhere as\r\nindependent countries to the Declaration of the United\r\nNations. The rest of the continent was still under colonial\r\ndomination.\r\nToday the United Nations boasts of African States\r\namong its 185 Members. On this fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, Botswana pays a warm tribute to a\r\ngreat Organization which has touched the lives of millions\r\nacross continents.\r\nThe United Nations has served us well. Small States\r\nsuch as my own have found in the United Nations a vital\r\nforum for collective bargaining. It has contributed to the\r\nadvancement of international cooperation in solving\r\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems. It\r\nis a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the\r\nattainment of these common ends. That is why, in our\r\nview, we need a more balanced, but effective and\r\nefficient, Security Council to act as our common tool in\r\nthe pursuit and defence of these common objectives.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nAfrica’s importance to the world is fully recognized.\r\nMost recently, we have seen the international community,\r\nthrough the United Nations, score major successes in peace-\r\nkeeping and peacemaking in Africa. In my subregion,\r\nMozambique has been rescued from the clutches of a\r\nmonstrous war, South Africa has been delivered from the\r\nevil of apartheid, Namibia is now an independent country\r\nand in Angola the peace process has entered a promising\r\nphase.\r\nOne of the milestones of the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly was the return of South Africa to the\r\nfamily of free and civilized nations as a democratic and\r\nnon-racial country. It is difficult to understand how\r\ninstitutionalized racism was allowed to exist for so long in\r\nthe aftermath of the victory of democracy over Nazism and\r\nfascism.\r\nIn West Africa, fortunately, Liberia is slowly moving\r\nback to peace after six years of bloody conflict. Elsewhere\r\nin Africa, we have seen tragedies of unspeakable\r\nproportions. Only last year, genocide was visited upon the\r\npeople of Rwanda. Somalia is still bleeding, seemingly\r\nremote from the concerns of the world. Sierra Leone is\r\nbeing consumed by a bitter civil war. These are painful and\r\ntroubling situations for the Governments and the people of\r\nAfrica.\r\nWhile it is obvious that Africa needs to strengthen its\r\ncapacity to predict, prevent and contain conflict situations,\r\nthe fact remains that the United Nations has primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. The Organization of African Unity stands ready to\r\nplay its part, as envisaged in Articles 52 and 53 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nOn behalf of my country and my people, I reaffirm\r\nour binding faith in the Charter of this, our United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Botswana for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire, President of the\r\nRepublic of Botswana, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Maréchal Mobutu Sese Seko,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zaire\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Maréchal Mobutu Sese Seko,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zaire.\r\nHis Excellency Maréchal Mobutu Sese Seko,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zaire, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is a great honour for me and for Zaire, my\r\ncountry, once again to address this distinguished General\r\nAssembly as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations.\r\nFirst of all, may I warmly congratulate a man who\r\nis himself a symbol, on the one hand, of the universalism\r\nof the United Nations, and on the other hand, of an Africa\r\nwhich has come of age to the extent that it has made an\r\nindelible mark on the United Nations by bestowing on it\r\none of its best talents. I refer to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a worthy son of whom Africa\r\nis particularly proud and who is, with competence and a\r\nspirit of self-sacrifice, fulfilling the difficult and delicate\r\nmission which is his.\r\nIn my capacity as one of the elder statesmen among\r\nAfrican heads of state, I wish, on behalf of my colleagues\r\nand of the peoples of Africa, to congratulate you warmly,\r\nSir, on the honour which the international community has\r\nconferred upon you by electing you to the presidency of\r\nthis regular session which coincides with the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of our Organization.\r\nFor us Africans, the United Nations is first and\r\nforemost a synonym of re-found dignity and freedom. The\r\nflag of the United Nations represents, above all, the\r\nuniversal emblem of the decolonization of the States of\r\nour continent. Indeed, members will recall that when the\r\nCharter founding the United Nations was signed in San\r\nFrancisco, only eight African countries were among the\r\nfirst 51 States to be admitted. From 1960 to 1990, that is,\r\nfrom the first proclamations of independence to the\r\nindependence of Namibia, all the other African States\r\nhave progressively won their seat within the United\r\nNations.\r\nLike any human endeavour, the United Nations is far\r\nfrom having reached perfection. A forum for dialogue and\r\nfor debate, an instrument for the prevention and\r\nmanagement of conflicts and a guarantor of international\r\nlaw and of the integrity of States, it remains the only\r\nglobal meeting point where each people can make its\r\nvoice heard.\r\nThis privilege, which places large and small on an\r\nequal footing within the United Nations, has strongly\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\ncharacterized the links between my country, Zaire, and the\r\nOrganization. In this respect, I would just like to recall two\r\ndates that are symbolic of this relationship. First of all, 20\r\nSeptember 1960, the date when Zaire was admitted to the\r\nUnited Nations, together with 12 other fraternal States from\r\nour continent.\r\nThe second date is 14 July 1960 when, in response to\r\nthe appeal by Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the\r\nSecurity Council authorized the establishment of a military\r\nand civilian assistance operation in my country, which was\r\nthen shaken by an armed conflict during which the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Dag\r\nHammarskjold, on a peace mission to Zaire, died on\r\nAfrican soil.\r\nThe United Nations may, it is true, fall short of our\r\nexpectations. It sometimes fails. None the less, Zaire\r\nbelieves that recognition of this fact should first and\r\nforemost prompt Member States to seek further cohesion at\r\nhigher levels and, in particular, at the regional level, as\r\nArticle 52 of the Charter of the United Nations invites us\r\nto do.\r\nIn order to restore peace and stability in Africa, the\r\nUnited Nations should endorse the option chosen in 1963\r\nby the founding fathers of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, that is, the inviolability of the borders inherited from\r\ncolonialism. The political translation of this principle lies in\r\nsafeguarding multi-ethnic States within which the rights of\r\nminorities are guaranteed.\r\nIt is desirable, in view of the new shape of the world,\r\nthat the adaptation of the United Nations be extended to all\r\nits organs, including the Security Council.\r\nThose who won the last world war conceived the\r\nSecurity Council as an organ within which their viewpoints\r\nwere to prevail. While the geopolitics of that time might\r\nhave justified such a state of affairs, today it must be\r\nrecognized that, given the new international situation and\r\nthe role expected of the United Nations, the exclusion of\r\nAfrica and of certain powers is no longer justifiable and is\r\nan intolerable injustice. Hence, a revision of permanent\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council is a logical demand\r\nand is necessary for the harmonious functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nAt this particular point in the history of our\r\nOrganization, a courageous decision by the international\r\ncommunity in this direction can only strengthen the role of\r\nthe United Nations and will be recorded forever in the\r\nannals of our Organization for the greater good of present\r\nand future generations.\r\nIn the text of my statement which I have deposited\r\nwith the Secretariat, I have provided a complete overview\r\nof the major problems of the day affecting Zaire, Africa\r\nand the world. I place special stress on the need to\r\nrespect the sovereignty of Member States and draw the\r\nattention of our Organization to the emergence of a\r\ndangerous phenomenon, cynically termed the right of\r\nintervention.\r\nI draw the attention of the United Nations to the\r\ntragedy that the phenomenon of refugees represents today\r\nand reiterate the proposal made at the Copenhagen\r\nSummit regarding the organization of a world conference\r\non refugees.\r\nLastly, I could not fail to mention the distressing\r\nproblem of Rwanda and Burundi, which is a dangerous\r\nthreat to the peace, stability and development of the entire\r\ncentral and eastern regions of Africa. Initiatives are under\r\nway to find rapid solutions to this tragedy. These\r\ninitiatives deserve the attention and support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nBearing in mind the situation now prevailing in my\r\nown country, I dwell at length in my statement on the\r\nways and means of resolving it. That is why I invite the\r\ninternational community to support our efforts with a\r\nview to the rapid organization of free, democratic and\r\ntransparent elections.\r\nOn the threshold of the second 50 years of the\r\nUnited Nations and the eve of the third millennium, an\r\naffirmation of peace and cohesion among peoples must,\r\nmore than ever before, constitute the prime legacy to\r\nbequeath to future generations. More than ever, it befits\r\nthe United Nations to be the guarantor and the depository\r\nof this legacy.\r\nAs regards Africa more specifically, with its mosaics\r\nof ethnic communities, with its economic lag, with its\r\nsocial handicaps, I affirm that, both within and outside the\r\ncontinent, we must make solidarity, security and\r\ndevelopment our watchwords for action and the spearhead\r\nof the fight against discord and injustice in the world.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe President of the Republic of Zaire for his statement.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Maréchal Mobutu Sese Seko, President\r\nof the Republic of Zaire, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela,\r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela, President\r\nof the Republic of South Africa.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Mandela: When distinguished leaders came\r\ntogether half a century ago to consign to the past a war that\r\nhad pitted humanity against itself, the ruins and the smoke\r\nfrom the dying fires were the monument to what should not\r\nhave been.\r\nFifty years after the formation of the United Nations\r\nwe meet to affirm our commitment to the founding ideal\r\nand the common desire to better the life of all human\r\nbeings. What challenges us who define ourselves as “states-\r\npersons” is the clarion call to dare to think that what we are\r\nabout is people — the proverbial man and woman in the\r\nstreet. These — the poor, the hungry, the victims of petty\r\ntyrants, the objectives of policy — demand change. What\r\nchallenges us is to ensure that none should enjoy lesser\r\nrights, and none be tormented because they are born\r\ndifferent, hold contrary political views, or pray to God in a\r\ndifferent manner.\r\nWe come from Africa, and South Africa, on this\r\nhistoric occasion to pay tribute to that founding ideal and\r\nto thank the United Nations for challenging with us a\r\nsystem that defined fellow humans as lesser beings. The\r\nyouth, at whom we have directed most of our awareness\r\ncampaign on this golden jubilee, should marvel at the\r\nnobility of our intentions. They are also bound to wonder\r\nwhy it should be that poverty still pervades the greater part\r\nof the globe; that wars continue to rage; and that many in\r\npositions of power and privilege pursue cold-hearted\r\nphilosophies which terrifyingly proclaim “I am not my\r\nbrother’s keeper”. For no one, in the North or the South,\r\ncan escape the cold fact that we are a single humanity.\r\nAt the end of the cold war the poor had hoped that all\r\nhumanity would earn a peace dividend, enabling this\r\nOrganization to address an expectation it was born to\r\naddress. And they challenge us today to ensure their\r\nsecurity, not only in peace but also in prosperity.\r\nThe changed world circumstances permit of neither\r\nthe continued maldistribution of resources nor the related\r\nmaldistribution of decision-making power within this\r\nOrganization itself. Indeed, the United Nations has to\r\nreassess its role, redefine its profile and reshape its\r\nstructures. It should truly reflect the diversity of our\r\nuniverse and ensure equity among the nations in the\r\nexercise of power within the system of international\r\nrelations in general, and the Security Council in\r\nparticular.\r\nWe raise this matter to make the fundamental point\r\nthat the agenda of the next century and the programme of\r\naction to promote it can be true to the purposes of this\r\nOrganization only if they are set by all of us. We must,\r\nwithout delay, constitute a new leadership for the new age\r\nand bring sunshine into the hearts of billions, including\r\nwomen, the disabled and children.\r\nCircumstances may tempt us to bend to the pressures\r\nof realpolitik. However, like the founders, we are faced\r\nwith the task of ensuring the convergence of word and\r\ndeed. But we are unlike them in that the obstacles we\r\nface are fewer and the conditions more auspicious.\r\nAs the United Nations matures into the new\r\nmillennium, it is called upon to facilitate the birth of a\r\nnew world order of peace, democracy and prosperity for\r\nall. Thus we can honour the memory of those who\r\nperished in pursuit of the founding ideal and protect\r\nfuture generations from the pestilences of war, hunger,\r\ndisease, ignorance and environmental degradation.\r\nThe time to act is now.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of South Africa\r\nfor his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela, President of\r\nthe Republic of South Africa, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jacques Chirac,\r\nPresident of the French Republic\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will next hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Jacques Chirac, President of the French Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacques Chirac, President of the\r\nFrench Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nPresident Chirac (interpretation from French): The\r\nworld needs the United Nations.\r\nFifty years after the founding of the United Nations,\r\nat a time when there are questions and doubts in some\r\nquarters, I want to express France’s confidence in our\r\nOrganization and the high esteem that it has for the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nConfidence and, therefore, commitment. France has\r\nalways been a leader in the search for peaceful solutions to\r\nthe crises of our times. From Cambodia to Bosnia, it has\r\nbecome the leading contributor of United Nations troops.\r\nCommitment too in the search for genuine\r\ndisarmament. No one disputes France’s major role in the\r\nnegotiations to ban chemical weapons, to eliminate anti-\r\npersonnel mines and to extend the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nindefinitely. Let no one doubt France’s determination to\r\nensure, in 1996, the success of the negotiations on the\r\ndefinitive, comprehensive and verifiable ban on nuclear\r\ntesting. It was the first to speak out for the zero option.\r\nToday I wish to confirm that, once its final series of tests\r\nis completed next spring, France will sign the Protocols to\r\nthe Treaty of Rarotonga establishing a South Pacific\r\nnuclear-free zone.\r\nCommitment, too, in the affirmation at the United\r\nNations of a universal conscience, reflected in legal\r\ninstruments and in programmes of action. It is in the vast\r\narea of human rights and solidarity among peoples that the\r\nirreplaceable nature of our Organization is most marked.\r\nThe world has changed in 50 years. In the past six, it\r\nhas undergone a mutation that is perilous and yet brings\r\nhope. Let us help the United Nations adapt to this new\r\nworld and play its role there effectively.\r\nLet us make the Security Council more representative\r\nby enlarging the circle of its permanent members to include\r\nGermany, Japan and some large States from the South. Let\r\nus learn from our successes, as from our failures, by\r\ndeveloping preventive diplomacy at the regional level and\r\nby increasing the rapid response capability of our\r\nOrganization in the humanitarian and military spheres.\r\nLet us seriously reflect together on the multilateral\r\ninstitutions of development aid: the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the United Nations\r\nagencies and programmes. France, which will preside over\r\nthe Group of 7 in 1996, will make the effectiveness of such\r\naid a major theme at the summit in Lyons.\r\nThe world has changed. So, too, has the third world.\r\nLet us take into account the differentiation that has\r\ngradually become more marked between the countries that\r\nenjoy strong growth and attract foreign investment and\r\nthose that are in difficulty and at risk of being\r\nmarginalized. The struggle against exclusion must be\r\ntaken up at the international level as well. Let us\r\nconcentrate a greater share of bilateral and multilateral aid\r\non the least developed countries, particularly those in\r\nAfrica. Today, as we have all seen, Africa is making\r\nprogress. Let us help it to succeed.\r\nLet us do better in addressing problems that are\r\nbecoming more serious: movements of populations,\r\nenvironmental degradation, major endemic diseases,\r\ndrugs. Without neglecting emergency aid, let us restore\r\ngreater emphasis on the search for long-term solutions by\r\nassigning a central place to structural policies and their\r\nfinancing.\r\nConcentrating official development assistance on the\r\nleast-developed countries and refocusing on long-term\r\npolicies are the two main areas which the necessary\r\nadaptations must address. Increasing the effectiveness of\r\ndevelopment assistance means pursuing these reforms\r\nwith all the actors — multilateral and bilateral, public and\r\nprivate. We will succeed only if we are ambitious,\r\ndetermined and, above all, united in a comprehensive and\r\ncoherent approach.\r\nThe proposals which France is presenting today, as\r\ncontained in the statement that we have distributed, will\r\nbe developed in the months ahead at the United Nations\r\nand with all our partners, especially those in the European\r\nUnion and in the Group of 7, our partners in the French-\r\nspeaking world and those which are emerging as pillars\r\nof tomorrow’s world. For the new approach needs to be\r\nbased on a real consensus, which we must build together.\r\nFifty years after it was drafted, the aims set forth in\r\nour Charter have lost none of their relevance: peace and\r\ndisarmament, democracy and development, the promotion\r\nof human rights and the fight against the great scourges\r\nthat threaten mankind. In these 50 years, a body of\r\ncommon values has gradually come to be asserted, thanks\r\nto the United Nations.\r\nToday, we must focus our efforts on the adaptation\r\nand renewal of our Organization, above all by giving it\r\nthe resources to operate. The temptation to disengage\r\nthreatens the very existence of the United Nations. It is\r\nnot acceptable that many countries, particularly the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nforemost among them, should let their arrears pile up,\r\nthereby bankrupting an Organization to which all the\r\nworld’s Heads of State and Government have come, in an\r\nunprecedented event, to affirm its irreplaceable nature on\r\nthis, its anniversary day. The world needs solidarity, and\r\nyes, it needs the United Nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe President of the French Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacques Chirac, President of the\r\nFrench Republic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Thomas Klestil, Federal\r\nPresident of the Republic of Austria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Thomas Klestil, Federal\r\nPresident of the Republic of Austria.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Thomas Klestil, Federal President\r\nof the Republic of Austria, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Klestil: The fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations is marked by a fascinating yet irritating\r\ncontradiction. Many of the States Members of the United\r\nNations believe that this jubilee is taking place at one of the\r\nmost difficult moments of its history. Crisis is the word of\r\nthe day. At the same time, more heads of State and\r\nGovernment are assembled here than ever before and more\r\nhuman beings, watching this gathering from every corner of\r\nthe world, are convinced that the United Nations is\r\nindispensable to the very survival of mankind.\r\nEver since the first moments of its existence, the\r\nUnited Nations has been torn between idealism and power\r\npolitics, between solidarity and egoism. It has always\r\nmirrored the state of the world, but at the same time it has\r\nbeen much more than the sum total of national interests.\r\nBut the most fateful contradiction was already present at its\r\ncreation. It was to be a community of nations, but the\r\nfamous opening words of the Charter read: “We the\r\npeoples”.\r\nThe history of the United Nations is the perpetual\r\nattempt to bring the world Organization closer to the people\r\nand to forge it into a genuine community of humankind. On\r\nthe Organization’s fiftieth birthday, the United Nations\r\nMembers assembled here today sense more than ever the\r\ngrowing need to transcend the confines of the nation-State.\r\nThe experience of the first half-century of our\r\nOrganization has shown, time and again, that people are\r\nahead of their Governments. And the burning problems\r\non the eve of the twenty-first century — the environment,\r\ndevelopment, human rights, population growth — force us\r\nto go beyond our traditional methods of international\r\ncooperation and crisis management. Thus, the time has\r\ncome for a new beginning.\r\nAs the only instrument for global action, the United\r\nNations has to accomplish a swift transition. Its primary\r\nrole is to be open — open to new realities in a\r\nmultifaceted world, open to new social and cultural\r\naspirations and open to a dramatic change in paradigms.\r\nThe profound transformations of our time, the rapidly\r\ngrowing importance and power of non-State actors —\r\nsuch as the media, religious groups or business\r\ncommunities — and the growing role of civil society\r\ndemand a new dimension of international cooperation.\r\nWherever this process of reform may lead us we\r\nshould never forget that the creation of the United\r\nNations, 50 years ago, was an act of faith — and its\r\nrenewal also has to be an act of faith. There is, however,\r\na significant difference: today’s faith in the United\r\nNations is based not only on the values and principles we\r\nall share, but also on the record of half a century of\r\nremarkable achievements — and, of course, of numerous\r\nshortcomings.\r\nWe can, and we must, learn the lessons from the\r\ntragedies that have occurred — and still continue to\r\noccur — in many parts of the world. We have to make it\r\nclear that no country, no one, shall be allowed to hide\r\nbehind a wall of sovereignty and silence when human\r\nrights are violated — and no offence against humanity\r\nmust remain unpunished.\r\nThe more we are ready to pool our sovereignty —\r\nand the European Union is a shining example of this\r\ndevelopment — the better we achieve these goals. And\r\nthe more nations unite, the better for national and for\r\nhuman security.\r\nGrowing unity, to last, requires the eradication of\r\nmisery, poverty and social injustice — and equal\r\nopportunities for all. Only a strong world Organization\r\nwill be able to meet these challenges.\r\nThere is no better way to celebrate the founding of\r\nour Organization than to make it efficient and financially\r\nviable. It is most urgent that we recognize the need for\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nreform — and it is most vital that we act quickly. For this\r\nwe need political will and determination; we need a United\r\nNations system that is universal and competitive; and we\r\nhave to give it the necessary financial means.\r\nAll Member States must shoulder their obligations\r\nunder international law to contribute to the expenses of the\r\nOrganization. The money we devote to peace-keeping,\r\npreventive diplomacy, resettlement of refugees and the\r\nmonitoring of human rights helps to prevent future\r\ncatastrophes whose cost would be far greater.\r\nMy country, Austria, is one of the three headquarters\r\nof the United Nations. From Vienna the world Organization\r\nfights against drug abuse and organized crime, controls\r\nnuclear energy and assists development for people in need.\r\nWe are proud to host such important United Nations\r\nactivities in our country.\r\nWe stand ready to join others in preparing our\r\nOrganization for a new era on this planet. We trust, Mr.\r\nPresident, that under your guidance, with the continued\r\nassistance of all United Nations staff, and with the\r\nunrelenting energy of our Secretary-General, this gathering\r\nwill give a decisive impetus to this undertaking. History\r\nand the future are on the side of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Federal President of the\r\nRepublic of Austria for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Thomas Klestil, Federal President\r\nof the Republic of Austria, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Constantinos\r\nStephanopoulos, President of the Hellenic Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Constantinos\r\nStephanopoulos, President of the Hellenic Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Constantinos Stephanopoulos,\r\nPresident of the Hellenic Republic, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Stephanopoulos (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I still vividly recall the founding 50 years ago of\r\nthe United Nations. It was an event which strongly\r\nimpressed all of us, and we placed many hopes in the new\r\ninternational Organization which was the successor to the\r\nLeague of Nations.\r\nMy country, Greece, was emerging from the war,\r\nand from triple enemy occupation which followed,\r\nemerging destroyed and bloodied. Its people wanted to\r\nlook to the future with optimism and with the certainty\r\nthat a new era would dawn for it and for all of mankind.\r\nWe wanted to believe that the era of wars, of bombings,\r\nexecutions, famines, and the other ills plaguing men were\r\nconsigned to the past. The great Powers had taken firm\r\nand definitive decisions. Security and peace were going\r\nto prevail at last. Democracy was going to govern the\r\ndestiny of nations, and the new international Organization\r\nwas going to settle the disputes which could emerge\r\namong them.\r\nThrough its authority, the United Nations would\r\nmake good the principles of international law throughout\r\nthe world, as well as respect for human rights, which\r\nwere to be the subject of a Universal Declaration. The\r\nOrganization would also contribute to economic\r\ndevelopment and cooperation between peoples, and would\r\ntake all necessary measures to avoid falling into the errors\r\nof the past, thus avoiding the weaknesses of the League\r\nof Nations. What great hopes we cherished at the time!\r\nSince then, 50 years have elapsed, and we have\r\nbecome more realistic. Wars have not ceased — nor have\r\nthe crimes which come in their wake, and misfortunes of\r\npeoples have resulted. International norms, if they are\r\ndeprived of the possibility of implementation, have turned\r\nout to be unable to impose themselves — and democratic\r\nprinciples as well as human rights are often deliberately\r\nignored and are replaced by interests and by opportunism.\r\nBut then one might wonder: Has nothing been done\r\nover these 50 years? No, it would be wrong to assert that.\r\nFor indeed, many things have been achieved — although,\r\nperhaps, not as much as we would have hoped.\r\nThe primary objective — which is that of preserving\r\nnew generations from the scourge of war — has been\r\npartially achieved. Thanks to what has been called the\r\nbalance of terror among the Powers — but also thanks to\r\nthe existence of the United Nations — it has been\r\npossible to avoid having the cold war transformed into a\r\nnew global conflict. The United Nations has always been\r\na forum for discussion and conciliation, and has been able\r\nto adopt significant resolutions which have not all\r\nremained a dead letter — quite the opposite.\r\nNevertheless, it is true that it has been impossible to\r\navoid regional wars which were unleashed throughout the\r\nworld. It is true that the responsibility for this does not\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nfall on the United Nations — which did not have, and still\r\ndoes not have, the possibility to ensure the implementation\r\nof its own resolutions unless the great Powers reach\r\nagreement and give it the necessary means to do so. That\r\nsaid, one might perhaps note that the Organization has been\r\nlacking in firmness in the application of the just decisions\r\nwhich it has taken. However, insisting on its resolutions\r\nwould have constituted strong moral pressure, which would\r\nhave been all the more effective if the Organization had\r\npersevered consistently and firmly.\r\nCyprus is a striking example of the inability of the\r\nOrganization to firmly and decisively condemn an act of\r\nmilitary aggression that was followed by occupation, which\r\nstill continues. The initial resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil and of the General Assembly were not applied, and\r\nwe have had to endure a military occupation which has\r\nbeen continuing for over 20 years.\r\nWe must in the most absolute and firm terms condemn\r\nnot only the use of force but also the threat of its use,\r\nwhich also constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Unfortunately, such\r\ncases have occurred quite recently. I refer, in saying this, to\r\nthe threat of war which a Member State, through a decision\r\nof its National Assembly, made to Greece if it were to\r\napply the provisions of the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea. What is astounding and totally inadmissible here is\r\nthat this threat was not formulated to ward off an illegal\r\nact, but to prevent a perfectly legitimate act.\r\nThe efforts made by the United Nations have been\r\nmore effective for economic development and cooperation\r\nbetween peoples — efforts which in many cases have been\r\ncrowned with success. It also goes to the credit of the\r\nUnited Nations that it has made a firm proclamation of the\r\nneed to respect and protect human rights, which, thanks to\r\nthe policy followed by the United Nations, have been\r\nrecognized and respected even in countries where they were\r\nin the past flagrantly violated. Doubtless, a great deal\r\nremains to be done — even in this area.\r\nStrengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations\r\nwould be to the advantage of all the members of the\r\ninternational community, which would then be acting within\r\nthe framework of a system that would have full respect for\r\nthe norms and principles of international law and in which\r\nthe rule of the strongest would not be able to prevail.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like most sincerely to express\r\nthe hope that the great and noble objectives of this\r\nOrganization, the fiftieth anniversary of which we are\r\ncelebrating, will be realized as soon as possible.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Hellenic\r\nRepublic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Constantinos Stephanopoulos,\r\nPresident of the Hellenic Republic, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mircea Ion Snegur,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Moldova\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Mircea Ion Snegur,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mircea Ion Snegur, President of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Snegur (spoke in Romanian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): The important international\r\nevent that has brought us together has a profound\r\nhistorical significance. Shaken by the horrors of the\r\nSecond World War and guided by the firm conviction that\r\nsuch apocalyptic cataclysms should never happen again,\r\nthe free nations and their spiritual leaders laid the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations 50 years ago.\r\nFrom this perspective, the first words of the\r\nCharter — “We the peoples of the United Nations” — are\r\na natural expression of the world community’s feeling of\r\nshared responsibility for the destiny of humankind.\r\nAt the present time, the international community is\r\nat a crossroads. An imperative on its agenda is the\r\nconception of a new world. It is probably the first time in\r\nhistory that we perceive the world as the common\r\nheritage of humankind and war as a crime, inequality as\r\nan injustice, and ecological degradation as a joint\r\nresponsibility.\r\nAmong the objectives of the world community,\r\npriority is given to those that aim at the creation of a new\r\ninternational system of political and economic relations.\r\nIn this context, a fundamental role is attributed to the\r\nUnited Nations. Is the United Nations ready to assume\r\nsuch a role? This is a question every Member State has\r\nto answer.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nThe end of the cold war has given rise to hope in this\r\nrespect. The United Nations has achieved remarkable\r\nresults, especially over the last few years: peaceful\r\nenvironments introduced in Cambodia, Namibia, El\r\nSalvador and Mozambique; assistance in democracy-\r\nbuilding to a number of States in different parts of the\r\nworld; and the adoption, by consensus, of a significant\r\nnumber of documents and resolutions, to name but a few of\r\nthese successes.\r\nTo do away with the structural and organizational\r\ndeficiencies within the United Nations and to increase its\r\npositive impact, the Member States have introduced a\r\nnumber of initiatives aimed at revitalizing the United\r\nNations and its capacity to adapt to the new realities. The\r\nRepublic of Moldova supports the Organization’s efforts to\r\nreform the Security Council and the restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, the Trusteeship Council and so on. We hope that\r\nthese initiatives will be successful and that as a result the\r\nUnited Nations will be stronger and more efficient.\r\nIn another line of thinking, we consider it necessary to\r\nconsolidate international law and to establish a new\r\ninternational legal order. At the same time, the need for a\r\nnew legal framework for the post-cold-war period is\r\nbecoming more and more evident. In this respect, it would\r\nbe useful, we think, to deepen some of the existing\r\nconcepts of international law, such as sovereignty, statehood\r\nand the competence of international organizations in general\r\nand, in particular, in correlation with the principle of self-\r\ndetermination. In our opinion, if these objectives are\r\nachieved, international law in the twenty-first century will\r\nbecome the language of international relations and will\r\ncontribute to overcoming explosive situations such as those\r\ncreated artificially, and sometimes inspired and supported\r\nfrom abroad, around minority problems.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova became a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations immediately after gaining its independence.\r\nWe took this step with the deep conviction that in the\r\ncompany of peace-loving nations and within the United\r\nNations, we would succeed in building, faster and on a\r\nmore solid foundation, a democratic and prosperous\r\ncountry, an independent and indivisible one, without foreign\r\narmies deployed on its territory.\r\nAfter more than three years of membership, we find\r\nwith satisfaction the advantages of our cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations. We continue to count on the support that\r\nthe United Nations can give us in urging the withdrawal,\r\nand in monitoring the withdrawal, of foreign troops from\r\nthe territory of our country.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to assure the Member\r\nStates of our Organization that, in pursuing the complex\r\ntask it has assumed — to build a peaceful, prosperous and\r\ndemocratic world — the United Nations will find in the\r\nRepublic of Moldova a partner with conviction, true to\r\nthe international responsibilities it has taken on.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of Moldova for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mircea Ion Snegur, President of\r\nMoldova, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu, President\r\nof Romania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu, President of\r\nRomania.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu, President of\r\nRomania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Iliescu (interpretation from French): Half\r\na century of existence would seem to be an occasion for\r\nlaudatory statements, even in the life of an international\r\norganization such as the United Nations. However, I\r\nbelieve that a gathering of more than 150 Heads of State\r\nand Government should be the occasion, not just for\r\nfestive speeches, but also for framing clear answers to the\r\nfundamental questions that billions of citizens of this\r\nplanet ask themselves each and every day, expecting us\r\nstatesmen to come up with concrete solutions.\r\nAre we to live in peace, or is the scourge of war still\r\nfiendishly lurking over our fate?\r\nShall we live in a more prosperous world, or shall\r\nwe plunge deeper and deeper into the abyss of poverty?\r\nShall we live in a world capable of restoring to\r\nhuman beings their full dignity and creative powers, or\r\nshall we continue to watch impotently the waste of new\r\ngenerations, undermined by disease, famine, promiscuity,\r\nhatred and the lack of moral perspective?\r\nShall we all be contemporaries of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, or will history and civilization on Earth\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nirreversibly splinter along the dividing lines of\r\ndevelopment?\r\nCertainly, such questions are disconcerting. However,\r\nno one has a ready-made answer to them. That is why,\r\nperhaps, voices may be heard arguing that this is not the\r\ntime to even ask these questions, here in the United\r\nNations, as they do not fall within the purposes of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nTo see that they really are wrong, we need only recall\r\nthe hopes that animated the spirit and the work of the\r\nfounding fathers of the United Nations.\r\nIn 1945, when we emerged from the inferno of the\r\nSecond World War, the creation of a world in which the\r\nexperience of total war could never be repeated was by no\r\nmeans an idealistic goal but the very essence of the\r\nendeavour to set up an organization with a universal\r\nvocation.\r\nThe prosperity of peoples achieved through\r\ncooperation was not merely the formula of some\r\ndaydreamers, but the rationale behind an international body\r\nmeant to constitute an orderly space for moral and legal\r\nvalues to govern the manifestation of the freedom of\r\ncreation of human civilization in all its diversity.\r\nInternational order based on legal norms, even if\r\nadministered under the authority of the privileged club of\r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council,\r\nrepresented the embodiment of reason and of the hope that\r\nthe world would never again fall prey to the demons of\r\nhatred and destruction.\r\nFifty years later, the relevance of those original\r\nquestions remains unaltered.\r\nIs this a reason to proclaim the failure of the United\r\nNations?\r\nPerhaps those who are rushing to proclaim it as such\r\nshould recall, before pronouncing verdict, how much the\r\nexperience of the past 50 years of the United Nations\r\nexistence has mattered for the legitimacy of these questions;\r\nhow much it has meant to the newly emerged States on the\r\nworld map that there existed a forum for the assertion of\r\ntheir identity and for the establishment of standards for\r\ncivilized behaviour in international relations; how much the\r\nUnited Nations has meant for the formulation of discourse\r\nand for the practical achievement of the communication,\r\nnegotiation and discussion of crucial issues of the\r\ncontemporary world, such as the regime of nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament, the identification and legal\r\ncondemnation of armed aggression, the conservation of\r\nthe cultural heritage of humanity and the building of the\r\nbasis for cooperation in the name of development.\r\nCertainly, the results do not yet respond to all needs\r\nand expectations. That is why I believe that our most\r\nimportant duty now, on the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, is to make the chance of a new beginning\r\ncome to fruition.\r\nReleased from the fetters of bipolarity and of the\r\ncold war, the international system has regained its natural\r\nfreedom of movement. Instead of ending, history is in fact\r\nstarting again.\r\nConcomitantly, however, all the problems that\r\nseemed forgotten or that had long been ignored,\r\napparently at no cost, have emerged anew, such as the\r\npainful and ever growing gulf between “those who have\r\nand can” and “those who cannot have” created by the\r\nunequal development of the different regions of the\r\nworld, by the accelerated destruction of the planetary\r\nenvironment, the sharp reduction in vital resources and\r\nthe resurgence of violence nurtured by intolerance and\r\ndisregard for fundamental human rights and freedoms.\r\nIn supporting the draft Declaration proposed for\r\nadoption by our General Assembly, I should like to\r\nemphasize the importance of the chapter devoted to\r\ndevelopment and, above all, to the measures required to\r\nfill the gap between rich and poor countries, the\r\nfundamental problem of global stability.\r\nWe have the chance of a new beginning. The United\r\nNations has a very full agenda for the twenty-first\r\ncentury. What we can do, even as of today, is to review\r\nits functional structures, mechanisms and architecture in\r\norder to render them capable of addressing those issues.\r\nTherefore, I propose for the coming year a special\r\nGeneral Assembly session to be dedicated to the structural\r\npreparation of the Organization for the agenda of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe President of Romania for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu, President of\r\nRomania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nAddress by His Excellency Captain Valentine E. M.\r\nStrasser, Head of State, Chairman of the National\r\nProvisional Ruling Council and Secretary of State for\r\nDefense of the Republic of Sierra Leone\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Captain Valentine Strasser, Head\r\nof State, Chairman of the National Provisional Ruling\r\nCouncil and Secretary of State for Defense of the Republic\r\nof Sierra Leone.\r\nHis Excellency Captain Valentine E. M. Strasser,\r\nHead of State, Chairman of the National Provisional\r\nRuling Council and Secretary of State for Defense of\r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nCaptain Strasser: Fifty years ago, after the guns fell\r\nsilent, 800 delegates from 50 States, assembled in San\r\nFrancisco, recognizing that future generations must never\r\nagain face the lessons of 1945, signed the United Nations\r\nCharter document.\r\nSecuring a safer future and promoting the rights and\r\nfreedoms of every living individual were the visions of\r\nthose founding leaders.\r\nToday, 135 additional States are members of this\r\ndemocratic organ, embracing almost every single State on\r\nthis planet. Five decades on, the dreams of those delegates\r\nto the original San Francisco Conference are still shared by\r\nevery single delegate here in New York.\r\nThe world has changed; giant nations are no longer\r\nconfronting each other with deadly weapons; the iron\r\ncurtain has given way to closer cooperation and the threat\r\nof nuclear annihilation has receded. Giant economic blocs\r\nare emerging and one-time arch enemies are today close\r\nallies.\r\nThese developments are parallel with the struggle for\r\npeoples under colonialism. Hardly any former colonial\r\nterritory had achieved complete independence 50 years ago.\r\nBut today, there is not a single State under colonial\r\ndomination as the United Nations turns 50.\r\nThe resolution of ancient and emerging new conflicts\r\nand the provision of humanitarian aid to the millions of\r\nhungry and dying peoples of the world are problems that\r\nthe United Nations, through its agencies, has grappled with.\r\nThese are remarkable achievements though, sadly,\r\nthey have been restricted to the richer nations in the\r\nNorth; the ripples have yet to make a significant impact\r\non the poorer small nations in the South.\r\nWhile the wealthier North enjoys stability,\r\ndemocracy and economic prosperity, increased\r\nproductivity, expanded markets and job opportunities, the\r\nunder-developed poor wallow in debt, famine, instability,\r\ndisease and death. Unfairly depressed commodity prices\r\nand a huge debt overhang threaten recovery for third-\r\nworld developing economies. Capital and investment\r\ndiversions to newly liberated Eastern Europe has left the\r\ncrippled economies of the world’s poorest starved.\r\nAfrica’s debt alone has moved from a staggering\r\n$200 billion in 1993 to $211 billion in 1994. Real per\r\ncapita aid has fallen since 1991 and sub-Saharan Africa’s\r\nshare of direct foreign investment for developing nations\r\nhas hit a mere five per cent. The level of overseas\r\ndevelopment cooperation is at its lowest ever. These\r\nimbalances are creating new tensions and divisions in\r\nAfrica.\r\nFrom Kigali to Monrovia, the dark continent is\r\nbeleaguered with armed conflicts. Africa’s armed\r\nmovements, coups toppling democracies, are the results of\r\nacute poverty. Insurgencies threaten democracies and\r\ntoday armed guerrillas are a threat to the envisaged\r\ndemocracy in Sierra Leone. Democratic elections are\r\nbilled for the first half of next year but there is\r\nspeculation that armed activities may disrupt the entire\r\nprocess.\r\nEarly in March last year, noting the serious security\r\nsituation which had the potential to complicate the\r\nLiberian peace process and destabilize the entire\r\nsubregion, the Secretary-General appointed Ambassador\r\nDinka, an Ethiopian, as his Special Envoy to Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nFive hundred thousand people are displaced and\r\n200,000 more have fled their homeland. Disease and\r\nhunger in the camps kill many daily. Refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons are desperate for relief.\r\nRural community dislocations have left the entire\r\nelectoral process with technical complexities and made\r\nfree and fair democratic elections a lot more expensive.\r\nWith a dreadful guerrilla campaign confronting an\r\nInternational Monetary Fund adjusted economy, an\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nabsence of substantial donor funding will kill democracy in\r\nSierra Leone. Guerrillas who kill peasants in remote\r\nvillages, shoot cattle, set huts on fire, use drugs and teach\r\n12-year-olds to carry AK47s are today’s terrorists; they are\r\na threat to Africa’s democratization and they must be\r\nisolated. Insurgents who sit and talk with Governments\r\nmust be urged to drop their lethal weapons and make peace.\r\nMr. President, I salute, through you, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Secretariat and all earlier Secretaries-General\r\nfor 50 years of dedicated service.\r\nLet us make the United Nations leaner and stronger\r\nand keep alive the vision of its founding leaders.\r\nThe President: I thank the Head of State, Chairman\r\nof the National Provisional Ruling Council and Secretary of\r\nState for Defense of the Republic of Sierra Leone, for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Valentine E. M. Strasser, Head of\r\nState, Chairman of the National Provisional Ruling\r\nCouncil and Secretary of State for Defense of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso, President of the Federative Republic of Brazil\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso,\r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso,\r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Cardoso (spoke in Portuguese; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Let me say how proud Brazil\r\nis to see a distinguished representative from Portugal\r\npresiding over this historic session.\r\nFifty years ago, the delegates who signed the San\r\nFrancisco Charter hoped to be creating a better world, one\r\nin which peace would be made possible through institutions\r\ncapable of ensuring a high spirit of cooperation among\r\npeoples.\r\nLike any other human endeavour, the United Nations\r\nhas witnessed both success and failure. Throughout its\r\nexistence, however, something very precious has been\r\npreserved: a feeling of hope. It is now time to renew it.\r\nWhat do our peoples expect of us today? What\r\nwould they want us to do for the United Nations?\r\nI am sure that the answer to these questions is\r\nunequivocal: they would want the United Nations to be\r\nthe guardian of the principles and rules that govern\r\nrelations among States; they would want the United\r\nNations to enforce them and guarantee that they be\r\ncomplied with, thereby providing a firm basis for the\r\ninternational order. They would want the United Nations\r\nto have effective instruments to promote conflict\r\nprevention and resolution as well as equitable forms of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is an aspiration of all mankind that the United\r\nNations be permanently engaged in the protection of\r\nhuman rights and in the fight against all forms of\r\ndiscrimination and tyranny.\r\nWe are living in better times than 50 years ago. By\r\nfreeing the international agenda of the tensions generated\r\nby ideological confrontation, the end of the cold war\r\ncreated the conditions for a growing convergence of\r\nvalues, with democracy, economic freedom and social\r\njustice at centre stage.\r\nNew opportunities for international cooperation have\r\nemerged. The world conferences that the United Nations\r\nhas been sponsoring — on environment, population,\r\nwomen, human rights, social development — have as a\r\nunifying theme the search for decent standards of living\r\nfor all peoples and for each individual human being.\r\nHuman advancement is therefore at the core of the\r\ninternational debate.\r\nBeyond the issues addressed by these conferences,\r\ncontemporary life presents challenges worthy of the\r\nattention of the United Nations.\r\nThis is a forum in which we should, within the\r\ncomplex context of globalization, work to overcome a\r\npersistent situation of social and economic inequalities\r\ngiving rise to hopelessness and a feeling of exclusion.\r\nThe goal of sustainable development must not be\r\nabandoned.\r\nWe must go from words to action so that peoples\r\nmay be able to confront their divisions and so that people\r\nmay be able to find in the United Nations a symbol of hope.\r\nWe must also work to make it possible for the\r\nextraordinary progress brought about by science and\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\ntechnology to be disseminated, for the benefit of all\r\npeoples.\r\nRegarding international peace and security, the role of\r\nthe United Nations will always be irreplaceable. In other\r\nissues, the United Nations will help us think together, guide\r\ndecisions and create new patterns of legitimacy.\r\nIn all areas, our peoples expect from their respective\r\nleaders that we be able to maintain a constant dialogue\r\nbased on truly universal values, a dialogue that can inspire\r\nthe various regional institutions, and all nations\r\nindividually, to work towards peace, development and\r\ncooperation.\r\nEach one of our countries should contribute to\r\nensuring that our Organization has the material means to\r\ncarry out the tasks with which we ourselves have entrusted\r\nit. It is inadmissible that the United Nations is undergoing\r\nits worst financial crisis precisely when the leaders of the\r\nwhole world are gathered to reaffirm their commitment to\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nLet us be frank. We are celebrating this fiftieth\r\nanniversary with an underlying feeling of ambiguity, as we\r\nsee the United Nations forced to resort to expediency in\r\norder to cover its huge deficits. This situation can paralyse\r\nour Organization just when its prospects look the brightest.\r\nWe must find a lasting way out of this impasse.\r\nI have come here today to reaffirm the Brazilian\r\ncommitment to fight for a stronger, more active United\r\nNations. This is not a new commitment, but one that\r\nreflects the history of Brazil’s participation in this\r\nOrganization. It has been a history of engagement, a history\r\nof the pursuit of peace and development, a history that\r\nmakes us willing now to assume greater responsibilities in\r\nthe deliberations of the United Nations.\r\nThis is the time to commemorate the renewal of the\r\nideals of justice and peace which 50 years ago, led to this\r\ngreat creation of the human spirit that is the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President thanked the President of the Federative\r\nRepublic of Brazil for his statement; His Excellency\r\nMr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Le Duc Anh, President\r\nof the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Le Duc Anh, President of\r\nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Le Duc Anh, President of the\r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Le Duc Anh (spoke in Vietnamese;\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is my\r\nparticular pleasure, on behalf of the State and the people\r\nof Viet Nam, to attend the Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting for the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nOver the past 50 years the United Nations has steadily\r\ngrown. Its growth has been closely linked with the\r\nstruggle of peoples for the right to self-determination and\r\nfor the fundamental purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, namely international peace and security,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity for all nations, freedom and\r\nequality among nations whether large or small,\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States and the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. These purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations constitute common values of all mankind; all\r\nnations and peoples hold the same responsibility to\r\npreserve and uphold them. Today, when international\r\nexchanges and interactions are taking place with an ever\r\ngrowing intensity, scope and complexity, adherence to\r\nthese fundamental purposes and principles takes on\r\nparticular importance.\r\nParadoxically, just when mankind has acquired the\r\ntechnology in effect to reduce the distance between the\r\nEarth and other celestial bodies, the gap between the rich\r\nand the poor has widened alarmingly. Every day, we\r\ncontinue to witness the human tragedy of countless\r\ninnocent people who are victims of wars, conflicts,\r\neconomic embargoes, epidemics and the scourge of drugs.\r\nAs a nation that experienced the horrible famine of 1945\r\nand several decades of the ravages of war and embargo,\r\nthe Vietnamese people know all too well the sorrow and\r\npain of war as well as the harshness of economic\r\nembargo and the deprivations of poverty. We therefore\r\nfeel deep empathy with the sufferings and losses of other\r\npeoples and individuals. From this rostrum, let me join\r\nmy voice to the earnest call for the international\r\ncommunity to do its utmost for the enjoyment by all\r\nindividuals and nations in the world of their fundamental\r\nrights to a life in peace, equality and development and to\r\ngood economic and social relations among States and\r\npeoples.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nThe urgent tasks before us are to eradicate hunger,\r\nalleviate poverty and create jobs; to uphold the right of\r\nwomen to equality and implement the right of children to\r\ncare and protection; and to ensure respect for fundamental\r\nhuman rights alongside respect for the sovereignty, security\r\nand development of every nation. We also need to\r\nsubstantially cut down military expenditures, eliminate\r\nweapons of mass destruction, decrease the trade in arms\r\nand move towards the termination of arms production and\r\ntrade, reduce and write off the debt of poor countries, and\r\nincrease investments for development and for the protection\r\nof the environment.\r\nWhat has been achieved by the United Nations over\r\nthe past 50 years in the fields of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, assistance to the process of\r\ndecolonization, promotion of friendly relations and\r\ncooperation for development among nations, and promotion\r\nof environmental, cultural, educational and humanitarian\r\nactivities is indeed remarkable. However, the shortcomings\r\nof our Organization are by no means small. In order to\r\ndischarge its mission successfully, the United Nations itself\r\nshould be revitalized. First and foremost, it should be\r\nturned into a democratic organization in which relations\r\namong Member States as well as between the United\r\nNations and each Member State are based on democracy\r\nand equality. The General Assembly must truly be the\r\nhighest authority of the United Nations, responsible to\r\nmankind for all questions related to international peace and\r\nsecurity, cooperation for development and other global\r\nissues. Agencies affiliated with the United Nations also\r\nneed to be renewed, and should be made to operate more\r\neffectively, with greater dynamism and transparency, within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations Charter and General\r\nAssembly resolutions.\r\nIt is a felicitous coincidence that 1995 is also the year\r\nwhen we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, today\r\nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Over the last 50 years,\r\nthe Vietnamese people have brought to bear their tradition\r\nof unity, self-reliance and resilience, enduring untold\r\nsuffering and overcoming countless hardships and sacrifices\r\nto defend the independence of their motherland, gradually\r\nbuilding for themselves a life of well-being, freedom and\r\nhappiness. We are committed to the implementation of an\r\nindependent, self-reliant and open foreign policy guided by\r\nthe credo that Viet Nam wishes to befriend all countries in\r\nthe international community, and strives for peace,\r\nindependence and development. We have achieved\r\nencouraging results in this regard.\r\nOn this occasion, allow me to express my sincere\r\ngratitude to all countries and international organizations,\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and to the\r\nspecialized agencies for their sympathy and valued\r\nassistance to Viet Nam. Viet Nam is committed to doing\r\nits utmost to make a worthy contribution to the lofty\r\ncause of the United Nations for peace, development,\r\nequality and justice, and for a finer world, as expressed\r\nin the motto of this special commemoration: “We the\r\npeoples of the United Nations ... united for a better\r\nworld”: a world without hatred or violence; a world of\r\nlove and happiness.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Socialist\r\nRepublic of Viet Nam for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Le Duc Anh, President of the\r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang\r\nNguema Mbasogo, President and Chief of State of the\r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema\r\nMbasogo, President and Chief of State of the Republic of\r\nEquatorial Guinea.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema\r\nMbasogo, President and Chief of State of the\r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): Mr. President, I am deeply honoured to\r\ncongratulate you on the high distinction that has been\r\nconferred upon you: that of directing the work of this\r\nimportant session of the General Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThis session will not only study current problems, but will\r\nevaluate the role of the Organization over the last 50\r\nyears.\r\nWe are at a crucial moment in the life of the\r\nOrganization, which is now marking its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. A half century of existence means a great\r\ndeal for an organization which was created to impose the\r\nwill of mankind, after sufferings caused by war, injustice,\r\ndiscrimination, poverty, underdevelopment and the\r\nundervaluing of the individual.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nThe creation of the United Nations was, accordingly,\r\nan act of conscience and an intention to reform on the part\r\nof nations which decided to stop trying to take the upper\r\nhand, in order to build a new world based on friendship,\r\nunderstanding, freedom, justice, tolerance, cooperation and\r\nlove.\r\nAfter 50 years, it is natural that a work created by\r\nman should be examined to see if it continues to respond to\r\nthe evolution of man and the times. Due to this, this session\r\nshould provide an opportunity to evaluate in depth the\r\nhistory of the Organization, with regard to what it has done,\r\nwhat it has not done, and whether its purposes and\r\nprinciples continue to be valid in this dynamic and\r\nconstantly evolving world.\r\nIn our opinion, the United Nations has not changed its\r\nphilosophy, after 50 years, nor has man, like his own\r\nCreator, stopped being man since he was created.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations is the reflection of\r\nhuman integrity, and is inspired by the humanitarian spirit\r\nof man, because its purposes and principles are to guarantee\r\nthe freedom and dignity of man, his well-being, and the\r\nsecurity, justice and peace of nations.\r\nNo one has been opposed to or will oppose these basic\r\ngoals because this would mean that man was denying his\r\nvery self.\r\nWhat we need to question here is man’s behaviour\r\nregarding his own work. What have the States led by us\r\nmen done with respect to our own post-war commitments?\r\nWhat is the attitude of man towards society, and what\r\nmethods have we adopted to implement the spirit of the\r\nUnited Nations?\r\nWe must look at ourselves in the mirror to answer this\r\nquestion, because the United Nations, in its capacity as an\r\ninternational institution, has no need to blame itself,\r\nbecause it represents, as an example, the Bible or the Koran\r\nfor the inspiration of the Member States. The successes of\r\nthe United Nations cannot be attributed to its officials. We,\r\neach Member State, make up the United Nations. It was\r\nthus understood by its founders when they decided that the\r\nCharter would begin with the sentence, “WE THE\r\nPEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS, DETERMINED\r\nTO ...” Hence, to the extent that we respect this Charter, we\r\ncan add up the successes or failures of the United Nations.\r\nTherefore, responsibility lies entirely with the Member\r\nStates.\r\nAlong the same lines, it is appropriate that we\r\nshould ask ourselves the following questions: Can we say\r\nthat we have ended wars between nations? Can we say\r\nthat we have done away with colonialism, when there is\r\nstill a great desire on the part of some to dominate\r\nothers? Have we really been able to ensure the freedom\r\nof man and respect for his rights? Do we respect the\r\nindependence, sovereignty, and equality of all nations?\r\nAfter 50 years, can we say that the nations of the world\r\nlive in peace, that individuals have their dignity and that\r\nthere is well-being for humanity?\r\nOur overall reply is that a fair amount has been\r\nachieved but much remains to be done because we can\r\nsee in various parts of the world that there are large\r\ngroups of human beings living in poverty, due to the\r\negoism of the wealthy or the irrational behaviour of\r\nGovernments. Racial, ethnic and social discrimination\r\nprevail, as does terrorism and the degeneration of man\r\nthrough drugs, alcoholism, and sexuality, which, in his\r\ndespair, lead to evil.\r\nRelations among States and economic blocs are\r\nunequal, and reforms cannot be proposed in the present\r\nunjust economic world order. Blatant interference in the\r\ninternal policy of other States has been observed, showing\r\ndisdain for their sovereignty. Today the voices of the\r\nthird-world countries can scarcely be heard because they\r\nare not given answers to their request that science,\r\ntechnology and the financial resources that are squandered\r\nbe dedicated to the development of the world.\r\nDecades have gone by in which the attention of the\r\nUnited Nations has been turned towards world\r\ndisarmament, in order to guarantee international peace\r\nand security when, to this end, we must ensure the\r\nfreedom and dignity of man, as well as his material and\r\nmoral well-being.\r\nLet us make the United Nations more realistic and\r\nchange the attitudes that contradict the spirit of its Magna\r\nCarta. We must replace interference in the internal affairs\r\nof other countries with respect for the freedom,\r\nindependence and sovereignty of other States. No one is\r\nthe policeman of the other. Let us substitute the\r\nintolerance and superiority or inferiority complexes in our\r\nrelations with dialogue, understanding and love. Let us\r\nreplace the present mechanisms that strangle our relations\r\nwith other mechanisms that involve more equality, reduce\r\ndependence and promote the interdependence of States.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nThere is no one who can better fulfil the obligations\r\nimposed by the Charter than us, because we have all\r\nlearned the lesson — but do not practise it in the proper\r\nway. However, some wish to put themselves forward as the\r\nbest defenders of human rights and as exemplary\r\ndemocrats. No one is against human rights or democracy\r\nbecause these principles do not harm anyone. Human rights\r\nand democracy must be the result of natural and orderly\r\ndevelopment in each society, which must conform to the\r\nmorality or the cultural heritage of each nation. Democracy\r\nand human rights should not become a passport for\r\nlegalizing interference in the internal policy of other States.\r\nDemocracy and human rights are difficult to apply in\r\nunderdeveloped societies which suffer from poverty, hunger\r\nand illiteracy. In short, the phrase “United Nations” exhorts\r\nus to unity, solidarity, mutual and sincere support, and not\r\nto confrontation or distrust.\r\nWhile presenting the congratulations of the people of\r\nEquatorial Guinea to the international community, which\r\ntoday celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment\r\nof the United Nations, I cherish the hope that the present\r\nsession of the General Assembly will herald new moves to\r\nstrengthen the role of our Organization to create a better\r\nworld with greater prosperity and solidarity.\r\nThe President: I thank the President and Chief of\r\nState of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema\r\nMbasogo, President and Chief of State of the Republic\r\nof Equatorial Guinea, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency General Maung Aye, Vice\r\nChairman of the State Law and Order Restoration\r\nCouncil of the Union of Myanmar\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by His Excellency General Maung Aye, Vice\r\nChairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council\r\nof the Union of Myanmar.\r\nHis Excellency General Maung Aye, Vice Chairman of\r\nthe State Law and Order Restoration Council of the\r\nUnion of Myanmar, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Aye: It gives me great pleasure to address this\r\nfiftieth anniversary Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nUnited Nations. I would like to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election to the high\r\noffice of President of the General Assembly. On this\r\nhistoric occasion, I wish to pay a special tribute to the\r\nsuccessive Secretaries-General for their selfless efforts to\r\npromote international peace and security and the well-\r\nbeing of the peoples of the world. I would also like to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the dedicated men and women\r\nwho have contributed to the cause of the United Nations.\r\nAnniversaries offer not only occasion for celebration\r\nbut also provide opportunity for reflection. This fiftieth\r\nanniversary marks a unique opportunity to review the\r\nachievements as well as the limitations of the United\r\nNations. The new international situation in which we now\r\nfind ourselves makes it all the more urgent to strengthen\r\nthe Organization to meet the evolving challenges and\r\nproblems.\r\nThe international community has changed\r\nconsiderably in the past 50 years; yet the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations framed in June 1945 continues to be valid\r\nto this day. The principles enshrined in the Charter — the\r\nequality of sovereign States, territorial integrity, the\r\npolitical independence of States and the peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts — must remain inviolate and be\r\nfaithfully observed in international relations. Erosion of\r\nthese fundamental principles will undermine the aims and\r\npurposes of the Organization. Any attempt to weaken the\r\ntime-honoured and universally accepted principles of\r\nsovereignty, of non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates and of self-determination would be cause for\r\nserious concern. In the process of restructuring the United\r\nNations, utmost care must be taken to ensure that the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization will be preserved and\r\nstrengthened. It must not be allowed to become a tool of\r\na few to impose their agenda on the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nAs responsible Members of the United Nations we\r\npledge ourselves to cooperate with the Organization to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. We recognize\r\nthat the security of each and every Member State is\r\nimportant. Seen from our perspective, security entails\r\nnon-interference in internal affairs and freedom from\r\nexternal pressures. Security is synonymous with the basic\r\nright freely to choose one’s own political, economic and\r\nsocial systems and to determine one’s future at one’s pace\r\nand in accordance with cherished values and ideals. Only\r\nstrict adherence to the fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter can assure nations of their security.\r\nMyanmar fully subscribes to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter. We are of the view that the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nUnited Nations must remain the central element of the\r\nevolving international order. Notwithstanding its\r\nimperfections, the United Nations as a global organization\r\nrepresents the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a\r\nbetter tomorrow. It has generated in the people of Myanmar\r\na sense of belonging to the global community. Myanmar\r\nattaches particular importance to the celebrations of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. A high-level\r\nNational Committee established to coordinate\r\ncommemorative celebrations on a national scale has been\r\nactive throughout the year.\r\nThe United Nations today stands at a crossroads.\r\nVoices are being raised questioning the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization. The United Nations needs strong support and\r\nunderstanding if it is to weather the political and economic\r\nstorms that batter and erode its foundations. There is no\r\nbetter alternative to the United Nations. In an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world, the United Nations is the only forum\r\nfor increased multilateral cooperation.\r\nThe anniversary is an opportune moment to rededicate\r\nourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter and\r\nto the spirit of the theme of the fiftieth anniversary, “We\r\nthe peoples of the United Nations...united for a better\r\nworld”. I would like to reaffirm Myanmar’s abiding faith in\r\nthe United Nations as a centre for harmonizing the actions\r\nof nations in the attainment of universal peace and\r\ncooperation. I have come here to renew Myanmar’s\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nand to pledge Myanmar’s continued cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI deem it appropriate to conclude my address with a\r\nquotation from the preamble of the Charter of the United\r\nNations which advises us all\r\n“to practice tolerance and live together in peace with\r\none another as good neighbours”.\r\nThe President: I thank the Vice Chairman of the\r\nState Law and Order Restoration Council of the Union of\r\nMyanmar for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency General Maung Aye, Vice Chairman of\r\nthe State Law and Order Restoration Council of the\r\nUnion of Myanmar, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable John\r\nMajor, M.P., Prime Minister and First Lord of the\r\nTreasury of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Right Honourable John\r\nMajor, Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury of\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable John Major,\r\nM.P., Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury\r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Major: The United Kingdom was present at the\r\nbirth of the United Nations. Throughout its 50 years we\r\nhave stood by the Organization and by our responsibilities\r\nin the Security Council. The United Kingdom today as we\r\nmeet here is the largest contributor of troops to United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations. British forces are\r\nserving in blue berets from Angola to Georgia, with over\r\n8,000 British troops in Bosnia alone. So I speak to you\r\nthis morning as a strong supporter of the United Nations,\r\nbut also as a candid friend. I want the United Nations to\r\nbe more successful in the future. It will be needed in\r\ntomorrow’s world, and so change is necessary.\r\nThe General Assembly first met amid the rubble and\r\ngloom of war-damaged London. But since then the world\r\nhas been transformed. The United Nations has grappled\r\nwith aggression. It has helped either to make or to keep\r\nthe peace. It has worked for arms control, and only days\r\nago the United Kingdom, France and the United States\r\nagreed to sign the Protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga.\r\nAn end to nuclear testing is now in sight as we move\r\ntowards a comprehensive test-ban treaty in 1996.\r\nThroughout the past 50 years the principles of the\r\nCharter have stood the test of time. But now I believe we\r\nneed to look ahead. The world is changing, and I believe\r\nit is time for the United Nations to change with it. We\r\nneed to confront challenges to peace and deal more\r\neffectively with the roots of crises. We need to encourage\r\ndemocratic and accountable government and protect the\r\nrights of the individual. We need to reduce poverty and\r\nprotect the environment, and we need to tackle the evils\r\nof international crime, drug trafficking and terrorism.\r\nThat is a demanding agenda. To achieve it, we need\r\na properly financed and efficient United Nations. I want\r\nchange because I want the United Nations to succeed. Let\r\nme emphasize that point: I want change so that the United\r\nNations can succeed. Some reforms have begun; many are\r\nneeded. What is clear is that inaction is no longer an\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\noption. The threat to the future of the United Nations will\r\nnot come from change: it will come from inertia.\r\nThere are questions that we must address: Is the\r\nUnited Nations spread too wide? I believe it is. Is there too\r\nmuch waste and duplication between different bodies? I\r\nbelieve there may be. Are the priorities right for the 1990s?\r\nI am not convinced yet that they are. As we form new\r\nbodies for new problems, do we close down those no\r\nlonger needed? Not enough, I think — there are some\r\nbodies we could usefully scrap. Can we improve the\r\nplanning, managing and financing of peace-keeping? I\r\nbelieve that we can. Is our machinery for preempting\r\nconflicts and disasters as good as it should be? I believe\r\nnot.\r\nThere are other questions as well: Should the Security\r\nCouncil be enlarged? I believe that it should. The subject\r\nhas been on the agenda for too long. It raises difficult\r\nquestions, but the issues are clear and the decisions are\r\nneeded.\r\nIs the United Nations being efficiently managed? I am\r\nsure more could yet be done to apply the best modern\r\npractices, with funding allocated to the most efficient\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIs perhaps too much time and energy being spent on\r\nritual verbal battles brilliantly interpreted into six languages\r\nand then printed on the world’s highest paper mountain? Of\r\ncourse it is — we know that is the case.\r\nLast, but most urgent of all, financial reform. The\r\nUnited Nations is in a financial crisis. It is not sustainable\r\nfor Member States to enjoy representation without taxation.\r\nContributions should be paid promptly and in full, and\r\narrears should be cleared. But this must be accompanied by\r\na new focus on efficiency, and by modernizing assessment\r\nto reflect the changing capacity of Members to pay their\r\ndues.\r\nI agree very strongly with the Secretary-General that\r\nwe should have a special session of the General Assembly\r\nnext year to address these issues.\r\nI ask these questions because they need answers. I\r\ndare say some of them are controversial, but we need frank\r\nand honest answers now because the world needs the\r\nUnited Nations as much today as at any time in the past;\r\nbut a United Nations that works; a United Nations using\r\ntoday’s methods to address tomorrow’s needs; a United\r\nNations that shows its worth to the taxpayer in all our\r\ncountries, for it is they who pay the subscriptions to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn that way I believe we can capture and can justify\r\npopular support for our Organization.\r\nToday we face difficulties that we must overcome.\r\nAt this commemoration, my hope is that we will find the\r\nwill to do so.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister and First\r\nLord of the Treasury of the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable John Major,\r\nM.P., Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury\r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nSher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister of the Kingdom\r\nof Nepal\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Right Honourable Sher\r\nBahadur Deuba, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sher Bahadur\r\nDeuba, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Deuba: To this great assembly of Heads of\r\nState and Government, the Secretary-General,\r\ndistinguished representatives and to you, Mr. President, I\r\nbring the greetings of the Government and people of\r\nNepal, as well as the best wishes of His Majesty King\r\nBirendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev for the success of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary session of the United Nations.\r\nOn this historic occasion, allow me first of all to\r\nreiterate my country’s deep and abiding commitment to\r\nthe principles and purposes enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter, whose ideals of peace, justice and\r\nprogress continue to sustain the hopes of humanity. For\r\na country which is the birthplace of the Buddha, the\r\nforemost of the apostles of peace and non-violence for\r\nover two and half millenniums, these ideals, together with\r\nthe concept of tolerance, understanding and equality, are\r\nvalues which are rooted deep in our national psyche and\r\nculture. It is a tribute to the vision of the founding fathers\r\nof our Organization that the seminal ideas which have\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nguided the United Nations in its first half-century should\r\nalso prepare us for its second.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth (Prime Minister of Mauritius),\r\nVice-President of the General Assembly, took the\r\nChair.\r\nPerhaps the greatest achievement of our Organization\r\nhas been its ability to adapt to the changing conditions and\r\nwork towards its goals even in the face of an inhospitable\r\ninternational environment. As a result, there is greater room\r\nfor hope in the world today. The spectre of a global nuclear\r\ncatastrophe which has haunted humanity since 1945 is less\r\nthreatening now with the end of the cold war. The\r\nabhorrent practice of colonialism that once justified the\r\nsubjugation of nations and peoples is no longer acceptable.\r\nThe novel concepts of preventive diplomacy and\r\ninternational peace-keeping introduced by the United\r\nNations have helped defuse international crisis situations\r\nand prepare the groundwork for peacemaking, the rewards\r\nof which are becoming increasingly visible in the once\r\nconflict-prone regions of the globe. Similarly, the\r\nOrganization’s functional approach to peace has provided\r\neconomic relief to the less privileged regions of the world\r\nand restored human dignity to the neglected segments of\r\nour global society.\r\nAs we seek solace in these achievements during the\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting, we would not be casting\r\naspersions on the abilities of the United Nations by\r\nsuggesting that much more needs to be done as we\r\napproach the dawn of the next century. While we are\r\ncurrently caught in a dilemma between our efforts to forge\r\na new world order and face the reality of global disorder,\r\nthere is a strong need to reinforce some of its mechanisms\r\nto cope with the demanding times. These relate to\r\nexpansion of the Security Council, a more efficient\r\nmanagement of the Secretariat, and greater democratization\r\nof international relations by extending the authority of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, truly the representative body of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThere is also an equally palpable need to better\r\ncoordinate the activities between our Organization and its\r\nprogrammes, funds, the specialized agencies and other\r\ninternational development institutions, particularly with an\r\neye towards enhancing the role of grass-root movements\r\nand citizen groups. Lately these movements, focusing on\r\nsocial, gender, population, environment and human rights\r\nissues, have not only become a strong international force in\r\ntheir own right, but have also been justified in expecting\r\nmore from this global institution. For its part, Nepal will\r\nsupport a coordinated examination of studies aimed at\r\nstrengthening the Organization, particularly those\r\nmeasures which also seek to free it from the vagaries of\r\nits insecure financial base.\r\nEver since Nepal joined the United Nations, it has\r\nsupported and participated actively in the peace-keeping\r\nand peace-building efforts of the Organization. Our efforts\r\nin this direction will continue as we look forward to\r\nparticipating in the new initiative for a stand-by United\r\nNations force designed to enable it to respond to any call\r\nfor assistance in time.\r\nNepal sees no substitute for a United Nations that is\r\nboth robust in standing and responsive to the needs of\r\nglobal security and the progress of its individual member\r\nnations. With the current preoccupation of the\r\nOrganization in many new civil and regional conflicts, its\r\nactivities on the development side have been weakened.\r\nThe much-talked-about peace dividend in a post-cold-war\r\nera has proved so far to be elusive, as the condition of the\r\nleast developed and land-locked countries continues to\r\ndecline. It would be unfortunate if things were to be left\r\nin their present state, especially when the developing\r\ncountries with their weak economic base have to cater to\r\nthe dictates of market mechanisms alone.\r\nToday, nations seek social and economic\r\ndevelopment within a framework of political freedom and\r\njustice in which the rights of individuals to live in dignity\r\nare respected. It is therefore not enough for Governments\r\nto pay lip service to these principles: they have to deliver\r\nthe goods to the people by lifting them up from dire\r\neconomic conditions and providing them with political\r\nstability to enjoy the fruits of freedom and prosperity.\r\nThe United Nations exemplifies a global dream and\r\nhas no peer in matching the aspirations of men and\r\nwomen everywhere. It is a dream of a world in which the\r\nstrong and the well-to-do are comfortable with their\r\npower and seek to act with confidence and magnanimity.\r\nIt is a dream in which the weak and the less fortunate can\r\nfeel secure when seeking to work for greater international\r\nharmony. For this collective vision of our world, we in\r\nNepal continue to remain committed to the ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Prime Minister\r\nof the Kingdom of Nepal.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sher Bahadur\r\nDeuba, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nHubert A. Ingraham, M.P., Prime Minister of the\r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nHubert A. Ingraham, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth\r\nof the Bahamas.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Hubert A.\r\nIngraham, M.P., Prime Minister of the Commonwealth\r\nof the Bahamas, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Ingraham: We are now 50 years removed from\r\nthat historic day when nations assembled for the purpose of\r\nuniting to address concerns over the human condition. Half\r\na century later, we are presented with an appropriate\r\nopportunity to examine how well the United Nations has\r\nfulfilled its purpose.\r\nIn its 50 years, the United Nations has gained vast\r\nexperience in virtually every field known to man, and its\r\nstorehouse has served well those nations whose needs and\r\ndesires fall within the parameters of the common\r\nprogramme of purposes and principles enshrined in its\r\nCharter.\r\nOur theme, “We the Peoples of the United Nations ...\r\nUnited for a Better World”, emphasizes that people, and the\r\nhuman condition, remain the highest priority of our\r\ncivilization.\r\nThe Bahamas feels honoured to be an integral,\r\ncontributing and well-served Member of the United\r\nNations. For our part, we would wish for all of our sister\r\nStates to enjoy, as we have been privileged to do, a strong\r\ncommitment to parliamentary democracy and freedom from\r\nstrife, tyranny and genocide. We further wish for all\r\nMembers of this Organization to enjoy freedom from the\r\nsocial ills of abject poverty, disease and unemployment,\r\nupon which distress is wont to feed.\r\nThe United Nations was born out of the ruins of war\r\nand the determination of the great Powers of the day to\r\ninsulate the world against a repetition of the disregard for\r\nlife and property resulting from two world wars in the first\r\nhalf of this century. Fifty years later, the world is a very\r\ndifferent place. The great Powers of 1945 have been joined\r\nin economic stature by new countries, including the\r\nvanquished of the world wars and other States, some of\r\nwhich had not come to political maturity in 1945.\r\nToday we are threatened more by regional conflict\r\nthan by global confrontation, and frequently the threats do\r\nnot come from sovereign States but, instead, from\r\nreligious and racial intolerance, ethnic hatred,\r\ninternational criminal cartels, natural disasters and\r\ndevelopment gone awry.\r\nIndeed, as we celebrate our fiftieth anniversary, we\r\nmust face squarely the threat of a new great war in which\r\nwe are all engaged. The war of which I speak is that\r\nwhich is being fought in defence of the environment. This\r\nis of particular concern to small island developing States\r\nsuch as the Bahamas, a fragile, service-based, archipelagic\r\necosystem of global environmental significance.\r\nIt is useful to articulate the many achievements for\r\nwhich the United Nations has been responsible. Notable\r\nare the tremendous advances made in world health,\r\nincluding immunization and disease reduction, improved\r\nfood production and delivery, improved shelter and\r\ngeneral living standards for the poor and higher literacy\r\nrates in the world. Notable too, are initiatives to safeguard\r\nand promote the rights of women and children.\r\nIn our region, where the nefarious traffic in illicit\r\ndrugs and the insidious erosion of society by powerful\r\ndrug cartels are well known, we fully appreciate the\r\nimportance of the United Nations role in galvanizing wide\r\ninternational support for the fight against the demons of\r\navarice and death.\r\nIn supporting democracy, political freedom and\r\nrespect for human rights, the United Nations has become\r\nthe champion of millions of people everywhere. The\r\ndemocratization of Haiti and the dismantling of apartheid\r\nin South Africa are not only notable triumphs of the\r\nhuman spirit, but also testimony to this Organization’s\r\nsuccess in positively influencing even seemingly\r\nintractable internal crises in individual Member States.\r\nWhere terrorism, tyranny and genocide have been\r\nperpetrated against individuals, States and Governments,\r\nthe United Nations has strengthened its resolve to take\r\npositive action. Permit me here to express special\r\nappreciation for the Blue Helmets and the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR). Their untiring efforts to meet the urgent needs\r\ncreated by political persecution, civil war and regional\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nconflict have been phenomenal. Today, greater and greater\r\nnumbers of people are being displaced by famine, natural\r\ndisasters and economic hardship, creating severe strains on\r\nthe resources of receiving States, such as the Bahamas. It\r\nis appropriate — and I so recommend — that this body\r\nrevisit the mandate of UNHCR with a view to providing\r\nassistance to those affected by these agents of displacement\r\nand misery.\r\nThe Bahamas is pleased to reiterate its commitment to\r\nthe further strengthening of this Organization. It is our\r\ndesire that the next five decades bear the fruit of our theme\r\ntoday: “We the Peoples of the United Nations ... United for\r\na Better World”. And in that regard, we hope for a world\r\nfreed from the scourge of illicit drug traffic, relieved of the\r\nburdens created by uncontrolled migration, protected by\r\ngreater environmental consciousness, enhanced through\r\nincreased literacy and health standards everywhere,\r\nstrengthened by Member States that fully honour their\r\nfinancial obligations to this body, encouraged that each\r\norgan and Member of this Organization will strengthen its\r\nsymbiotic relationship for the benefit of mankind\r\neverywhere and, finally, we hope for a world liberated from\r\npoverty, disease, unemployment, racism, religious\r\npersecution, tyranny and strife.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Prime Minister of\r\nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Hubert A.\r\nIngraham, M.P., Prime Minister of the Commonwealth\r\nof the Bahamas, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime\r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime\r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.\r\nHer Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister\r\nof the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nBegum Zia (spoke in Bengali; English text furnished\r\nby the delegation): The United Nations has turned fifty. We\r\nare celebrating this landmark anniversary of the signing of\r\nthe United Nations Charter to reaffirm its goals and\r\nrekindle its ideals.\r\nAs we observe this anniversary, we may pause to\r\nreflect on the circumstances in which this august body was\r\nfounded after a terrible world war in the middle of this\r\ncentury. The goal was “to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war”, to enable mankind to live in\r\npeace and security with the common aim of striving for\r\ndevelopment and progress. The United Nations has had its\r\nshare of successes and failures, but, there can be no\r\nthought of abandoning it because there is no alternative.\r\nOur commitment to the United Nations is\r\nunswerving. We have always upheld and resolutely\r\npursued the United Nations mandate for peace and\r\ndevelopment. As we salute the United Nations flag and\r\npay tribute to those who wear the blue helmets of peace-\r\nkeepers throughout the world, we take great pride in our\r\nrecord of being among the foremost troop-contributors\r\ndispersed over many conflict areas. We are ready to serve\r\nthe United Nations cause through standby forces closely\r\nlinked to both early-warning and preventive systems.\r\nBangladesh fully supports the reforms and\r\nrestructuring of the main organ of the United Nations. I\r\nfeel it is indeed ironic that when so many world leaders\r\nhave gathered to solemnly pledge their commitment to the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, when it comes to making\r\ncrucial decisions affecting the destiny of mankind, such\r\ndecisions are made by a handful of countries.\r\nStrengthening the rule of law is critical to preserving\r\nthe security of smaller and weaker States. The enhanced\r\nrole and contribution of the International Court of Justice\r\n(ICJ) thus assumes greater relevance. Measures for\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction or arbitration through the ICJ or\r\nthird-party mediation are therefore important.\r\nWhile we are assembled here to celebrate the\r\nfounding of this august body, over 40 million people in\r\nmy country are facing poverty and destruction owing to\r\ndeprivation of our rightful share of the waters of the\r\nGanges River by India through unilateral withdrawal at\r\nFarakka. While withdrawal of water during the dry season\r\ncauses serious drought, the release of excess water during\r\nthe rainy season creates severe floods in a vast area of\r\nBangladesh. Besides the colossal loss in economic terms,\r\nthis is causing serious degradation to the environment and\r\nto the ecology.\r\nThe Farakka Barrage has become an issue of life and\r\ndeath for us. Owing to obstruction of the natural flow of\r\nwater upstream, a process of desertification is evident\r\nthroughout the northern and western parts of Bangladesh.\r\nVegetation is dwindling, salinity is spreading in the south,\r\nthreatening industry and agriculture with ruin. Fish and\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nanimal resources are facing extinction. Innumerable people\r\nof various occupations who depended on the River Padma\r\nfor their living are becoming unemployed. Many are being\r\nuprooted from their homes and hearths. As the whole world\r\nvoices concern for the protection of the environment and\r\nhuman rights, at that very moment a big part of the\r\npopulation of Bangladesh is being pushed over to the\r\nthreshold of poverty and destruction. This is a gross\r\nviolation of human rights and justice.\r\nI had mentioned this acute problem before this world\r\nbody in 1993. Unfortunately, in spite of our best efforts, the\r\nproblem still remains unresolved. I would like to call upon\r\nall of you gathered here today to help resolve this problem.\r\nIf we look around the world today at the numerous\r\nconflicts, big and small, at aggressions perpetrated against\r\nsmall States, at genocidal conflicts and “ethnic cleansing”,\r\nand denial of the right of lower riparian countries to the\r\nwater of common rivers, there are many who may question\r\nthe justification of this world body.\r\nDespite these drawbacks, mankind has not been able\r\nto evolve a more effective forum. The fiftieth anniversary\r\noffers the ideal opportunity to review its achievements and\r\nto look forward — to look forward to a strengthened and\r\nreinvigorated United Nations, a United Nations that has\r\nbeen restructured, attuned and democratized to meet the\r\nchallenges of the next millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Prime Minister of\r\nthe People’s Republic of Bangladesh for her statement.\r\nHer Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister\r\nof the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Klaus Kinkel, Vice-\r\nChancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nGermany\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Klaus Kinkel, Vice-Chancellor and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Germany.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Klaus Kinkel, Vice-Chancellor and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nMr. Kinkel (spoke in German; English text furnished\r\nby the delegation): Fifty years ago, delegates from 51\r\nnations, meeting in San Francisco to found the United\r\nNations, gave the world a portent of reason, solidarity and\r\nhope. That same portent brings us together here today.\r\nIn looking back we have to admit that, unfortunately,\r\nhistory does not always follow the straight paths of\r\nreason, but it does give us opportunities for progress\r\nwhich sometimes border on the miraculous.\r\nOne such unique gift was the removal of the Berlin\r\nWall and the barbed wire in Germany and throughout\r\nEurope. The ending of the East-West conflict freed the\r\nworld from the fear of a nuclear inferno. It has relieved\r\nus of the burden of the arms race and given all nations\r\nnew opportunities — for self-determination, peaceful\r\ncooperation and a sustainable global economic\r\ndevelopment. Yet many of the renewed hopes of peace\r\nattaching to those opportunities are still unfulfilled. Above\r\nall, we have been unable to bridge the gap between North\r\nand South, between rich and poor.\r\nToday, on the threshold of a new millennium, we\r\nmust learn the right lessons from the experiences gained\r\nover the last 50 years. We cannot change what lies behind\r\nus, but we can do better in the future. We must influence\r\nand shape what lies ahead. What is the challenge we are\r\nfacing? Nothing less than to keep the Earth habitable for\r\nour children and grandchildren; to make sure that eight or\r\nten billion people can live in humane conditions.\r\nThe German astronaut Thomas Reiter and his\r\nRussian colleague went for a five-hour-long walk in space\r\nlast weekend. “The Earth is incredibly beautiful”, both of\r\nthem said after their walk. And I believe that it is our\r\nresponsibility to see to it that the Earth continues to be\r\nincredibly beautiful.\r\nNever was it so abundantly clear that the only choice\r\nopen to mankind is to succeed together or to fail together.\r\nAnd that is why we must renew and strengthen the\r\ncovenant of San Francisco, the covenant for peace, human\r\nrights and development, for the joint survival of the\r\nhuman race.\r\nOnly if it charts its course by this compass will\r\nmankind be able to survive. For the world, the United\r\nNations is without alternative. That is the truly important\r\nfact we have to grasp in the world Organization’s jubilee\r\nyear. Only then will we also muster the strength to carry\r\nout the necessary reforms. These reforms will have to\r\nsucceed now. The United Nations must overcome its\r\nfinancial and structural crisis. However, if it is to do so\r\nit needs our support, and not just destructive criticism.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nLet us settle our conflicts peacefully. Peace must\r\nfinally be restored to the former Yugoslavia. Let us scrap\r\nand destroy weapons of mass destruction and other\r\nweapons, such as anti-personnel mines, which, day in and\r\nday out, kill or maim innocent civilians, including,\r\nunfortunately, many women and children.\r\nWe must not allow people to be murdered, tortured,\r\nviolated or persecuted and expelled on grounds of race,\r\nfaith or political conviction.\r\nLet us combine our strength for the economic and\r\nsocial progress of the nations in a new partnership for\r\ndevelopment. Children all over the world must be\r\nimmunized against disease, and they should be able to\r\nattend school. Let us protect the Earth, the oceans and the\r\nrivers from pollution.\r\nFinally, let us pay our contributions, without which the\r\nUnited Nations cannot perform its vital functions. Here I\r\nshould like expressly to welcome what President Clinton of\r\nthe United States and others said yesterday on this subject.\r\nSince the Second World War Germany has pursued\r\nthe cause of peace and human rights. We have tied our\r\ndestiny to that of a united Europe and have participated in\r\nthe global campaign against poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nThe ending of the East-West conflict brought us the unique\r\ngift of reunification. This imposes upon us a special\r\nresponsibility for the concerns of the world Organization.\r\nThe United Nations can continue to count on\r\nGermany.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Vice-Chancellor\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Klaus Kinkel, Vice-Chancellor and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Désiré Vieyra, Minister\r\nof State for Coordination of Government Action of\r\nBenin\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Désiré Vieyra, Minister of State for Coordination of\r\nGovernment Action of Benin.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Désiré Vieyra, Minister of State\r\nfor Coordination of Government Action of Benin,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Vieyra (interpretation from French): It is a\r\ngreat pleasure for me to participate in this Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, and to express the\r\nappreciation of the people and Government of Benin to\r\nthose men and women whose historic vision made it\r\npossible, through the creation of the United Nations, to\r\nlay the foundations for the international legal order on 26\r\nJune 1945 in San Francisco.\r\nThis is a fitting time to pay a well-deserved tribute\r\nto successive Secretaries-General, whose determination\r\nand dedication to the cause of peace and the progress of\r\nhumanity have contributed to the triumph of noble ideas,\r\nand to all the Secretariat staff for their commitment and\r\ndynamism.\r\nI particularly wish to congratulate Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, the first son of the African continent to\r\noccupy the position, both exacting and exciting, of\r\nSecretary-General, for his courage and his humanism,\r\nwhich have commanded the admiration of all.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn Benin, where the values of democracy and\r\npolitical pluralism have prevailed since 1990, we have\r\naccorded this event all the importance that it merits,\r\ntaking into account the hopes that the peoples of the\r\nwhole world place in the capacity of the United Nations\r\nto meet the major challenges confronting humanity. For\r\nus, this celebration is an opportunity, above and beyond\r\nthe festivities and the various events, to evaluate the 50\r\nyears of operations of the United Nations, with a view to\r\nmaking it more useful and more effective.\r\nIn spite of the long period of tension and the global\r\nrivalries of the cold war — fortunately a thing of the\r\npast — the universal Organization has stood the test of\r\ntime and, during this turbulent century, has been able to\r\ntake significant initiatives. States continue to exchange\r\nviews on very diverse questions involving all sectors of\r\nhuman activity.\r\nThe United Nations, as it reaches the half-century\r\nmark, must commit itself with resolve to the fight against\r\npoverty. In this respect, we cannot fail to be pleased that\r\nat the World Summit for Social Development we finally\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\noverturned a sacrosanct principle to the effect that a\r\ncountry’s social action must be determined by its economy.\r\nWe shall now base our economies on the social sphere.\r\nIn this respect, I am gratified at the proclamation of\r\n1996 as International Year for the Eradication of Poverty.\r\nToday Benin is striving, with the help of its development\r\npartners, to reduce the rate of infant and maternal mortality\r\nand to reduce illiteracy by placing particular emphasis on\r\nhealth and education.\r\nIn order that the United Nations may always be able\r\nto serve the peoples of the world, and in order that lasting\r\npeace may be achieved, we must strengthen the\r\nOrganization’s capacities with regard to the prevention of\r\nconflicts, the maintenance and strengthening of peace, and\r\nwe must provide it with the means to accomplish its\r\nmission. In my view, the action of our Governments cannot\r\nsucceed without the support of all the members of the\r\ninternational community, including civil society, the private\r\nsector and non-governmental organizations.\r\nWe must also support the vital role of the United\r\nNations in mobilizing support for the well-being of\r\nhumanity. It is especially in our interest to enable the\r\nOrganization effectively to tackle the specific problems of\r\nthe developing countries — in particular, those of Africa\r\nand the least-developed countries, whose recovery requires\r\nsubstantial efforts and resources.\r\nIndeed, Africa, in spite of its human resources and its\r\nimmense economic potential, is undermined and ruined by\r\ndifferent afflictions. It was in recognition of the magnitude\r\nof the challenges to be met, both individually and\r\ncollectively, that the Organization of African Unity adopted\r\nat Abuja the resolution that was to lead to the establishment\r\nof the African Economic Community, with a view to the\r\nintegration of members’ fragile national economies. This\r\nresolution cannot be implemented successfully without the\r\nunfailing support of the United Nations.\r\nTo speed up the development of that continent, so\r\nmany times plundered and pillaged, there is a need to\r\nestablish without delay the sort of Marshall Plan for which\r\nthe Heads of certain African States, with Benin in the lead,\r\nare constantly calling. I believe that this plan should be the\r\nculmination of a series of measures to be taken by the\r\ninternational community with a view to ensuring not only\r\nthat the commitments regarding Africa made in the\r\nframework of summits and conferences organized by the\r\nUnited Nations since the beginning of this decade are\r\nrespected, but also that the Agenda for Development is\r\nimplemented.\r\nIn 1945, Franklin Delano Roosevelt told his\r\ncolleagues:\r\n“Friends, our goal is peace — not only the end of\r\nthis war, but the end of all wartime.”\r\nThe world has certainly evolved, but the United Nations\r\nCharter has lost none of its timeliness. We therefore\r\nremain confident in the Organization’s capacity to realize\r\nthe aspirations of all peoples to a world of solidarity,\r\njustice and peace.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister of State for\r\nCoordination of Government Action of Benin for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Désiré Vieyra, Minister of State\r\nfor Coordination of Government Action of Benin,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Datuk Abdullah bin Hadji\r\nAhmad Badawi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMalaysia\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Datuk\r\nAbdullah bin Hadji Ahmad Badawi, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Malaysia.\r\nHis Excellency Datuk Abdullah bin Hadji Ahmad\r\nBadawi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Abdullah: The United Nations is 50 today, yet\r\nit remains an Organization beset with problems, both\r\nsubstantive and organizational. The United Nations has\r\nachieved much in the past, but confidence has waned in\r\nrecent years in its ability to discharge its functions as\r\nmandated by its Charter.\r\nIf the United Nations is to proceed into the next\r\nmillennium and remain relevant to the needs of its\r\nMembers and the international community, and if it is to\r\naddress in a comprehensive manner all issues relating to\r\nwar and peace, economic growth and responsible\r\ngovernance, then restoring confidence in itself and\r\nrebuilding its image must remain its priority task and\r\nresponsibility. While it is our right to expect the United\r\nNations to achieve this objective, giving support and\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\ncommitment to the United Nations must be our unshirkable\r\nresponsibility.\r\nMalaysia strongly believes that the United Nations\r\nshould be the body to promote globalism and pluralism. It\r\nmust stand clearly on the side of universal values in\r\ncombating genocide and aggression. As the world\r\napproaches the next millennium, the United Nations must\r\ncontinue humanity’s struggle against the elimination of\r\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear\r\ntesting, above all, must cease immediately.\r\nPeace and security cannot be built on arms reduction\r\nalone. Development focused on the eradication of poverty\r\nand the removal of bottlenecks towards global prosperity\r\nmust remain the priority task and responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations. In this role, the United Nations should not\r\nbecome an instrument for disciplining developing countries\r\nwhile allowing for power politics and global domination by\r\na few powerful countries.\r\nThe buzz word during the general debate at the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly and at this meeting since\r\nyesterday has been “reform”, with the focus on the reform\r\nof the United Nations. In our view, there is a need for a\r\ncomprehensive agenda for the reform of the multilateral\r\nsystem. Indeed, it is time for us to forge a new framework\r\nfor multilateralism for the twenty-first century. This agenda\r\nshould encompass the principal organs of the United\r\nNations, including the Security Council and the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, as well as the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization.\r\nThe agenda must also acknowledge the important role\r\nand contribution of science and technology, the business\r\nsector and the non-governmental organizations. They have\r\nenriched multilateralism, contributed to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and promoted the\r\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples.\r\nScientists and businessmen have made immense\r\ncontributions to the emergence of a global village. They\r\nhave set up a network, a super-information highway, and\r\nfacilitated financial and trade flows, which have made\r\nborders porous. As the scientists lead us into the era of\r\ncyberspace, we need to put in place a code of conduct that\r\nwould regulate the flow of information. The United Nations\r\nmust be in the forefront of cooperation in cyberspace to\r\nensure the full involvement of the international community.\r\nYet, at the same time, the current activities of the\r\nUnited Nations have suffered as a result of financial\r\nconstraints. The financial constraints have set in motion\r\nan exercise drastically to reduce expenditure on\r\ndevelopment in an arbitrary and rushed manner. While we\r\nwelcome the convening of an emergency special session\r\nto address this issue, we would appeal to all Member\r\nStates to honour their commitments by paying their\r\nsubscriptions in full and on time.\r\nIn order to achieve these objectives, appropriate\r\ninstitutional changes are required. These include, first, the\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council through the\r\nexpansion of its membership and a review of the veto\r\nwith a view to its total elimination. Secondly, the General\r\nAssembly should play its rightful role as a forum in\r\nwhich sovereign equality prevails, including providing\r\npolicy guidance to the Security Council. The Trusteeship\r\nCouncil could be disbanded. Thirdly, the Bretton Woods\r\nInstitutions should return to their original mandates and\r\ntake on board the new Powers on the geo-economic\r\nscene. Fourthly, the International Court of Justice should\r\nbe revitalized with changes in its composition, including\r\nthe discontinuation of allotting automatic seats to the\r\nveto-wielding Powers.\r\nWhile countries recognize the reality of power\r\npolitics and their application, particularly in the bilateral\r\ncontext, the reformed and restructured United Nations\r\nmust no longer be the tool of any one country,\r\nirrespective of its power. Humanity must find succour and\r\nsustenance in this global institution, which must become\r\nthe true vehicle for the promotion of multilateralism.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Malaysia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Datuk Abdullah bin Hadji Ahmad\r\nBadawi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Amre Moussa,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt and Special\r\nEnvoy of the President\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nAmre Moussa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt and\r\nSpecial Envoy of the President.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amre Moussa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Egypt and Special Envoy of the\r\nPresident, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nMr. Moussa (interpretation from Arabic): I have the\r\nhonour to make the following statement on behalf of\r\nPresident Hosni Mubarak, President of the Arab Republic\r\nof Egypt.\r\nFifty years ago, Egypt joined 50 other countries in\r\nwitnessing the birth of the United Nations which was the\r\nbirth of a new international order that was to be founded on\r\nthe principles and the goals enshrined in the Charter we\r\nsigned in San Francisco. One of the most important goals\r\nof that new international order was to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, in the wake of the\r\nhorrors of the Second World War. It also aimed at\r\nachieving justice, equality, economic prosperity, social\r\nadvancement and the protection of the sovereignty of\r\nStates, as well as the realization of the aspirations of\r\npeoples after freedom and self-determination.\r\nToday, we are gathered together here to celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. This is a unique\r\nopportunity to assess our successes and our failures and to\r\nglean from our experiences the object-lessons which would\r\nshed light on the reasons behind such successes and failures\r\nand, thereby, help us chart, together, the road to the future.\r\nThe very preservation within the realm of the possible,\r\nof the principles and goals of the United Nations Charter\r\nwas an achievement unto itself. The Charter remains\r\ntoday — as it has been throughout the past 50 years — true\r\nto its goals, lofty in its expression and clear in its\r\nprinciples. To the credit of this Organization is that it has\r\nbeen a source of hope, a torch-bearer and an element of\r\nconstruction.\r\nOn the basis of the Charter and within the framework\r\nof the United Nations, we have brought about\r\ndecolonization and put an end to racial discrimination in its\r\nmost brutal form, apartheid. We have been able to promote\r\nnew theories for economic and social development and\r\ninitiate international specialized action in a varied range of\r\nfields, such as agriculture, industry, science, health, the\r\nenvironment and many others. Together, we have started to\r\norganize international activities on land, in the air and at\r\nsea.\r\nSo, let us not be unfair in our assessment of the past\r\n50 years. Much has been achieved.\r\nHowever, the bright image is overshadowed by dark\r\nand murky clouds, the most ironic of which is that the\r\nUnited Nations stands on the verge of bankruptcy even as\r\nwe celebrate its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nHowever, this alone is not where the tragedy lies.\r\nThe real tragedy is that despite our success in achieving\r\ndecolonization, hegemony and policies of aggression\r\ncontinue to afflict the international scene. Despite our\r\nsuccess in ending apartheid, racial discrimination and\r\nreligious intolerance are still rife in many parts of the\r\nworld. Despite our success in promoting many theories\r\nfor development, economic imbalances persist due to the\r\nwidening gap between North and South — a gap that\r\nportends the division of the world, for decades to come,\r\ninto rich and poor, thus entailing migration,\r\ndiscrimination, terrorism, social ills, and a myriad of other\r\nadverse political effects. Despite our success in\r\nestablishing political and security frameworks on the\r\ninternational and regional levels, to deal with issues such\r\nas disarmament and human rights, we still suffer from the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and persistence in\r\nnuclear practices on the one hand, as well as from the\r\nlack of resolve when it comes to dealing with human\r\nrights, on the other hand. In fact, it is in these two areas\r\nspecifically — nuclear disarmament and human rights —\r\nthat serious political imbalances appear in the present and\r\nthe emerging world orders alike. Very succinctly, we can\r\nput this down to the existence of double standards.\r\nSuch political and economic imbalances have led to\r\na social imbalance that, undoubtedly, will lead, at the\r\ninternational level, to psychological aberrations that will\r\nimpact negatively on future generations the world over.\r\nWhile we celebrate 50 years of the world order that\r\nwas established in the aftermath of World War Two and\r\nmove closer to the beginning of the twenty-first century,\r\nmankind is sitting atop a volcano that is beginning to\r\nspew its lava.\r\nNevertheless, let us not slide into the quagmire of\r\ndespair. Let us not waste our scientific achievements by\r\nour political misconduct. Let us build up the credibility of\r\nthe international order, in a manner that instills confidence\r\namongst people. When we speak of peace, let us truly\r\nmean peace; when we speak of development, let us put it\r\ninto effect; when we talk about human rights, let us\r\nrefrain from resorting to double standards; and, when we\r\nspeak of disarmament, let us do so without excepting\r\nanyone.\r\nAs we look to the future, let us arm ourselves with\r\ncourage, with integrity and with fair play; let us free\r\nourselves from double standards and from bias. As we\r\ncelebrate the United Nations fiftieth anniversary, let us\r\nnot blow out any candles, but light candles so that they\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nmay illuminate our path in these murky and dangerous\r\ntimes and enable us to reach the prosperous and stable\r\nfuture in which peace may reign supreme.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Egypt and Special Envoy of the President for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amre Moussa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Egypt and Special Envoy of the\r\nPresident, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Leal, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nErnesto Leal, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Leal, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nicaragua, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Leal (interpretation from Spanish): The United\r\nNations emerged 50 years ago from the rubble of the\r\nSecond World War. On this fiftieth anniversary we must\r\nstrive for the resurgence of a renewed United Nations, with\r\nits principal aim, which is “to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war”, as stated in the Charter — but its\r\nprincipal aim should also be to contribute to development,\r\nto eradicate the poverty that affects many of our countries.\r\nThis Commemorative Meeting should not be simply\r\none more anniversary of our Organization. It must mark an\r\nimportant step in the history of mankind. Anniversaries can\r\nbe nothing more than commemorative dates if we do not do\r\nsomething concrete that would truly measure up to our own\r\naspirations.\r\nWe should therefore, on this occasion, make a solid\r\ncommitment to consolidate peace. I therefore wish, in this\r\nforum which has so often witnessed the horrors of war and\r\nhuman suffering, to make an appeal for the cessation of all\r\ninternational conflicts and controversies both current and\r\npotential.\r\nA new era of peace in the world demands the\r\ndevelopment of a United Nations plan of action, with the\r\nfull participation of the Secretary-General, aimed especially\r\nat promoting a peaceful solution to all of the controversies\r\nand differences that still persist and that can affect\r\ninternational peace or security. Every conflict resolved in\r\nthe world will be a victory for peace.\r\nThe best tribute that we can pay to the United\r\nNations Decade for International Law is to arrive at the\r\ncentennial of the 1899 Peace Conference in The Hague,\r\nwhere the Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of\r\nInternational Conflicts of 1899 was agreed with a\r\nhumanity in which dialogue will have prevailed over\r\ndifferences. All States Members of the United Nations\r\nmust work for a humanity free of disputes or conflicts so\r\nthat we can arrive at that third peace conference — which\r\nwas referred to and proposed yesterday by the President\r\nof the Russian Federation — free of disputes, free of\r\nconflicts — so that we may enter the twenty-first century\r\nas the century of peace.\r\nThe time has also come to faithfully fulfil the\r\ncommitment established in the Charter to promote the\r\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples. We\r\nmust, therefore, begin the United Nations’ largest peace-\r\nkeeping operation, that is, placing the human being at the\r\ncentre of economic and social development. I wish also\r\nto call for a re-orientation of the structures of the United\r\nNations towards the topic referred to yesterday by the\r\nPrime Minister of Japan — the subject of human security.\r\nDevelopment should be the other phase of the work\r\nof the next 50 years of the United Nations — a United\r\nNations that looks towards the South, which is still poor\r\nand without resources, so the twenty-first century may\r\nalso become the century of development. We face the\r\ngreat challenge of turning into reality the results of the\r\nworld conferences on children, the environment, social\r\ndevelopment, population, human rights and women.\r\nLike the United Nations, Nicaragua too, with the\r\ninvaluable support of this Organization, has emerged from\r\nthe ashes of war. Today we are advancing successfully\r\ntowards a new order of democracy and freedom in a spirit\r\nof national reconciliation. In that context, we have already\r\nrequested the United Nations to observe the election that\r\nwill take place next year in Nicaragua.\r\nNicaragua is also resolved to continue to participate\r\nin the decision-making process in the United Nations,\r\nwhich will define the direction of the Organization.\r\nDemocracy is today a universal value that should guide\r\nour agenda permanently. We must be aware that without\r\nfreedom, nothing will be possible.\r\nLastly, I believe that this fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations is the appropriate time for us to reaffirm\r\nour active commitment to the Charter of the Organization,\r\nfor us to work towards a United Nations that is efficient,\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 23 October 1995\r\nrenewed in its values and reformed in its structures. It is\r\ntime for us to allocate, at last, the well-known “peace\r\ndividends” to the progress of the emerging democracies and\r\nleast developed countries — time for us to strengthen\r\ndemocracy with the fruits of sustainable development and\r\nnot to leave the new or restored democracies alone in their\r\nfragile process of transition. This is the time for us to make\r\nof the United Nations a place of true universal\r\nrepresentation, without exclusions of any kind — for us to\r\nforge, not only a preventive diplomacy, but also a true\r\npreventive democracy, which could contribute to\r\nanticipating problems, eliminating poverty and\r\nstrengthening democratic institutions, so that we can form\r\na peace operation, but this time against terrorism and\r\ndrug-trafficking.\r\nI do not wish to conclude without reiterating that if\r\nwe are able peacefully to resolve the disputes that still\r\npersist, and if we transform the United Nations into a\r\ngreat force for economic and social progress, we will\r\nhave sealed for the twenty-first century the indivisible\r\nalliance between peace and development.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nicaragua for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Leal, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Nicaragua, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: Before adjourning the meeting, I\r\nshould like to inform delegations that, owing to the\r\nlateness of the hour, it will not be possible to hear all the\r\nspeakers scheduled for the meeting this morning. The\r\nremaining speakers will therefore be moved to this\r\nafternoon’s meeting at 3 p.m. as first speakers in their\r\nrespective categories.\r\nI should like to ask all delegations to be present\r\npunctually at 3 p.m. so that we can begin our afternoon\r\nmeeting on time.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n30\r\n"
