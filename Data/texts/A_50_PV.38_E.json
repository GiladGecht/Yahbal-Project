(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 29 (continued)\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State\r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe President: This afternoon we hold the fourth\r\nmeeting of the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe Assembly will first hear an address by His\r\nMajesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nKing Mswati III: I bring with me from the Kingdom\r\nof Swaziland the greetings and good wishes of Her Majesty\r\nand of the entire Swazi nation to all our friends and fellow\r\nmembers of the United Nations.\r\nMy task today is a very simple one: it is to declare\r\nmy country’s continuing commitment to the founding\r\nCharter of our Organization and to pledge our support to\r\nthe United Nations and its agencies, through the\r\nprovisions of the Declaration we shall be adopting.\r\nThis Declaration includes the original purposes and\r\nprinciples of our Organization and the same hopes and\r\nexpectations of the founding leaders. For them, after the\r\nexperience of two world wars, the idea of a world united\r\nin pursuit of peaceful development represented the best\r\nchance for humanity to focus its energy and resources,\r\nnot on the futility of conflict, but on the necessities of\r\nsurvival.\r\nFifty years later, experience provides us with a clear\r\nimage of our failures — as well as of our\r\nachievements — and requires of us that we learn from\r\nour mistakes and build on our successes. We have much\r\nto be proud of, and we honour particularly those whose\r\nlives have been dedicated and lost in the service of\r\nmankind.\r\nAmong those of us who have the privilege of\r\naddressing this historic gathering, I may, if God so wills,\r\nbe one of the few who will be present when we\r\ncommemorate our Organization’s centenary, in the year\r\n2045. I say this not out of pride, nor in the rashness of\r\nyouth; I say this because today I stand before you,\r\nrepresenting not only my country, but also the youth of\r\nthe world and the generations still to come whose\r\nexpectations and hopes for their own lives and for the\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nfuture of mankind must form the focus for the United\r\nNations in the next 50 years.\r\nAnd what are those expectations, those hopes? I\r\nbelieve the United Nations founding fathers would have\r\nrecognized their own goals in those of my generation. They\r\nare not too much to ask. They are, after all, what every\r\nhuman being has a right to expect — to have good health,\r\nshelter, security for one’s family, to be free to pursue the\r\nideas and beliefs of choice, to be educated and employed\r\nand, above all, to be able to live in peace on equal terms\r\nwith one another and in harmony with all God’s creations.\r\nThe Declaration we have before us, with its blueprint\r\nfor the improved performance of the United Nations,\r\nrepresents our best chance to realize our people’s dreams.\r\nIt requires of us, as Members of an Organization from\r\nwhich not one person or nation must feel excluded, to work\r\ntogether with a common purpose and to a collective set of\r\npriorities and principles.\r\nWe recognize the need for the United Nations and its\r\nagencies to have the structures and capacity to be able to\r\nwork on our behalf with efficiency, transparency and\r\naccountability and always with an ear to the wishes of its\r\nmembership.\r\nThe key decision-making bodies in which we place\r\nour trust must adapt in such a way that they truly represent\r\nall countries and arrive at conclusions that take into account\r\nthe opinions and welfare of our peoples.\r\nAs Members, we must each of us recognize the\r\nresponsibility we assume with our membership: to support\r\nour Organization, to respect one another’s sovereignty,\r\ntraditions and individuality; to implement the plans of\r\naction designed for our social, economic and political\r\ndevelopment and to abide by the principles of our founding\r\nCharter for the good of those whom we represent.\r\nIn the year 2045, I wish to be able to stand and meet\r\nthe gaze of my children, and my grandchildren, and say,\r\n“We did our best”. If we can all share this commitment to\r\nfuture generations — and if our Organization can adapt to\r\nthe changing requirements of the times — then the world\r\nin 50 years’ time will be a safer, happier place for all and\r\nwe will have discharged our duty to our own peoples and\r\nto all mankind.\r\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland, I do so\r\ncommit myself and my people to the future of the United\r\nNations in the belief that it is the one, global organization\r\nwith the capacity and purpose to allow us to reach our\r\ngoals.\r\nThe President: I thank the Head of State of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland for his statement.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Rtd. Flt.-Lt. Jerry John\r\nRawlings, President of the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Retired Flight-Lieutenant Jerry\r\nJohn Rawlings, President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nHis Excellency Rtd. Flt.-Lt. Jerry John Rawlings,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Rawlings: Today we acknowledge and\r\napplaud that powerful vision of the equal rights of\r\nnations, large and small, of men and women, and of\r\nfreedom and justice enshrined in the noble Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Charter has given the post-war international\r\ncommunity of States moral and legal bearings. It has\r\nexpressed in unforgettable words, with irresistible logic,\r\nthe principles on which a new, better world could be\r\nbuilt, a world where tolerance and mutual respect would\r\nreign.\r\nThis fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for\r\ncelebration: United Nations membership has grown from\r\n51 States to 185; the old colonial empires, as we all\r\nknow, have been dismantled, even if new forms are\r\nemerging; the cold war may seem to be at an end, though\r\nmany of us are still living with its very painful legacies;\r\nand issues of the environment, women and children,\r\nsocial development and population have been placed at\r\nthe centre of the development agenda. Let me on this\r\noccasion pay tribute to the honourable lady from\r\nTanzania, Mrs. Mongelia, under whose leadership the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing,\r\nsuccessfully got its point across to the world. Today, we\r\nknow that development means people and the quality of\r\ntheir lives, and not just statistical indices.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nOn this very important occasion, I salute the United\r\nNations on your behalf, most of all for the millions who are\r\nhealthier, safer and happier through one form of United\r\nNations action or another. We must also salute the United\r\nNations agencies for the millions of refugees worldwide\r\nwho, but for the Organization, would have lost hope and\r\neven life itself. We must pay tribute to the United Nations\r\nfor its peace-keeping efforts to stem human suffering.\r\nFinally, we must also pay tribute to the United Nations for\r\nthe independence of many new States and for the end of\r\napartheid rule, especially in South Africa.\r\nIn congratulating the United Nations, we are\r\napplauding ourselves. The Organization is very much us. It\r\nis the collective will of the international community of\r\nsovereign States, embodying our collective weaknesses as\r\nwell. This fiftieth anniversary is therefore also a time for\r\nvery sober reflection on our failures. Talking about our\r\nfailures, I think it is also important that on this occasion, as\r\nwe applaud ourselves for our successes, we must at the\r\nsame time acknowledge that expressed in the many conflict\r\nsituations in different parts of the world are very painful\r\nsituations resulting in the loss of many lives.\r\nWithin this sober reflection, we must also admit\r\nfailures that are manifested in the revival of genocide and\r\nin ethnic cleansing, blatantly practised in different guises\r\naround this globe of ours. These failures are shown on the\r\ndistended stomachs of malnourished children all over the\r\nthird world, and most especially on my continent, in Africa.\r\nFor us in Africa particularly, the next 50 years will perhaps\r\nbe even more crucial than the past 50 years. We want to\r\nsee in the international community, and in the framework\r\nof the United Nations, a reversal of our continent’s\r\nmarginalization.\r\nWe cannot help being struck by the fact that the\r\ninternational community is willing to spend $5 million a\r\nday on United Nations peace-keeping operations in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina — and we do not begrudge those noble\r\npeople such international solidarity; indeed, they deserve\r\nit — but when we have asked for a sum that represents 10\r\nto 15 days of that bill to help those of us in Africa who are\r\nmaking every possible effort to assist ourselves with our\r\nmeagre resources, there is a deafening silence. Should such\r\ndouble standards continue? This is the question I put before\r\nyou. How long will world statesmen omit even a glancing\r\nreference to Africa as they survey the world scene, despite\r\nthe numerous resources that she has provided to today’s\r\nmodern world?\r\nLet us not forget that Africa’s resources — as I have\r\nsaid, both human and material — have over the centuries\r\nmade a very major contribution to the wealth of nations\r\nand to human progress. We must therefore denounce the\r\nselfishness that has the means and sees the other’s needs,\r\nbut refuses to meet them. We see the reckless over-\r\nconsumption of some amid the wrenching, grinding\r\npoverty of so many. We feel the hunger in the midst of\r\nplenty, the want in the midst of so much abundance.\r\nWe must equally deplore the international focus on\r\nonly what is negative about Africa and the indifference to\r\nthe positive that also prevails on this continent: the\r\nimages of starving children but not of new schools and\r\nclinics; the emphasis on failed policies but not on success\r\nstories that have been chalked up all over the continent,\r\nvery often with the assistance of the developed\r\ncommunity, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as\r\nwell as the World Bank; and the focus on urban\r\ndegradation but not on new industrial progress, which is\r\nanother unfortunate misrepresentation of what is taking\r\nplace on our continent.\r\nLet us hope that the next 50 years of the United\r\nNations will see the end of these double standards in our\r\ninternational affairs. As we salute the Organization’s\r\nachievements and acknowledge its shortcomings, we must\r\ndo everything possible to commit ourselves to reform and\r\ndemocratization within this august body. Let us together\r\nrecapture that vision of the Organization’s founding\r\nfathers and keep the hopes of millions alive. Let us, the\r\ntrustees of that vision, turn our words into positive action\r\nfor generations to come. Let us build a world in which\r\nthe sense of internationalism that gave us this honourable\r\nCharter will carry us into a twenty-first century where\r\nright and not might will prevail; where justice will subdue\r\ninjustice; and where the small and weak can safely live\r\nalongside the big and strong without feeling intimidated.\r\nLet us remember that there can be no bright future\r\nfor the world, no new international order that is\r\nsustainable, without Africa occupying a dignified place,\r\nher rightful place at the table of humanity and in the\r\ncouncils of global decision-making.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Ghana for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Rtd. Flt.-Lt. Jerry John Rawlings,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Soeharto, President of\r\nthe Republic of Indonesia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Soeharto, President of the\r\nRepublic of Indonesia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Soeharto, President of the\r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Soeharto (spoke in Bahasa Indonesian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): I deem it a\r\ndistinct privilege for me to participate, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Indonesia, in this historic\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is\r\nparticularly significant to us in Indonesia, for this year we\r\nare also celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nproclamation of our independence. It is no coincidence that\r\nboth the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitution\r\nof Indonesia embrace the same principles and objectives,\r\nboth yearning for the universal peace that will come only\r\nwhen all humankind share the fruits of freedom and justice.\r\nFor Indonesia, the United Nations is an important\r\nforum for the fulfilment of our constitutional mandate to\r\ncontribute to the eradication of colonialism, domination,\r\npoverty and injustice everywhere and to the shaping of a\r\nnew international order. The United Nations has figured\r\nprominently in Indonesia’s struggle to preserve its freedom.\r\nThe United Nations has played a crucial role in\r\ncontaining conflicts in various regions. To ensure peace in\r\nthis post-cold war era, however, we need to enhance the\r\ncapabilities of the United Nations through more effective\r\nglobal and regional mechanisms for peacemaking, peace-\r\nkeeping and post-conflict peace-building, as well as\r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nOn the whole, the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies have pursued an immense array of activities that\r\ntouch every aspect of people’s lives all over the world. It\r\ncannot, however, continue to carry them out with\r\nundiminished success and vigour while it totters on the\r\nbrink of financial insolvency. This situation cannot go on\r\nindefinitely without adverse consequences to the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nLet this fiftieth anniversary of our Organization be an\r\noccasion for all of us to address this critical issue, as well\r\nas the issues relating to its reform, revitalization and\r\ndemocratization, so that it will be able to adapt to the\r\nchallenges of our time.\r\nSince the 1960s the United Nations has launched a\r\nseries of international development strategies, but these\r\nhave not been sufficient to redress the imbalances\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries. The\r\ngap between them continues to widen. The developing\r\ncountries remain marginalized from the world economic\r\ndecision-making processes.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, there has been a new\r\nsurge of interdependence and multilateralism, while the\r\nworld economy has become increasingly globalized. The\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, at its Jakarta Summit in 1992,\r\nadopted a new approach and orientation and launched an\r\ninitiative to once again engage the developed countries in\r\na dialogue, based this time on mutual interests and\r\nbenefits, equitably shared responsibility and genuine\r\ninterdependence. It is our hope that the revival of this\r\ndialogue will be distinctly reflected in the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment so that it will adequately complement the\r\nAgenda for Peace.\r\nIn these troubled times, we, the Governments and\r\npeoples of the world, look up to the United Nations for\r\nthe sustenance of our hopes. There is no question but that\r\nwe need the United Nations. What we often forget is that\r\nthe United Nations needs us too. We applaud its triumphs,\r\nbut we often forget that its failures are ours too. Its\r\nresponsibility is our responsibility.\r\nThe United Nations has served us well over the past\r\nhalf century. However, we will never be able to realize\r\nthe new international order of greater peace, social justice\r\nand common prosperity so long as the Organization is\r\nallowed to remain in the state that it is in today. We can\r\nreach that goal only after we have finally made the\r\nUnited Nations the effective instrument of peace that was\r\nenvisaged 50 years ago.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Indonesia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Soeharto, President of the\r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Bailey Olter, President\r\nof the Federated States of Micronesia\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Bailey Olter, President of\r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bailey Olter, President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Olter: I have the honour and privilege of\r\nbringing to this historic gathering the greetings and best\r\nwishes of all the people of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia. The presence here of so many nations\r\nrepresented at the highest level is the greatest testament to\r\nthe universality of the United Nations and provides us with\r\na strong political foundation on which to chart our\r\nOrganization’s role for the next 50 years.\r\nAs other speakers have noted, this is a time not only\r\nfor celebration, but also a time for reflection and\r\nassessment. As a people who have placed special reliance\r\non the United Nations throughout its existence,\r\nMicronesians living today have always felt we were a part\r\nof the Organization even though we became a Member only\r\na few years ago.\r\nWe will remain grateful to the members and staff of\r\nthe Trusteeship Council and to the United States, as\r\nTrusteeship Administering Authority, for the roles they\r\nplayed in our progress towards self-determination and,\r\nfinally, independence. It is fitting that just prior to this\r\nanniversary the Trusteeship Council completed its work.\r\nThus, the successful discharge of its heavy assignment\r\nunder the Charter is one of the accomplishments we rightly\r\ncelebrate here today.\r\nToday we also celebrate the fact that in the course of\r\nthe past 50 years there has been a sharp decline in the\r\npractice of colonialism by the world’s major Powers. But,\r\nunlike the experience with the Trusteeship system, the\r\nCharter has been less effective in bringing some nations to\r\nput aside their own self-interests and assign their colonial\r\nholdings to a rightful place in the history books. This\r\nunfortunate reality still affects the lives of thousands of\r\npeople throughout the region of the Pacific Islands.\r\nBecause our region is distant from the homelands of\r\nthe colonial Powers, it retains a certain usefulness to them\r\nfor the disposal of their dangerous materials and for the\r\nconduct of tests and other practices too hazardous to carry\r\nout at home. Thus, on assertion of the sovereign rights of\r\nGovernments half a world away, we, along with the\r\ncolonial inhabitants, are forced to endure the consequences\r\nof these actions, consequences which will be felt for\r\ngenerations to come. This dampens our celebration today.\r\nAs we know, the Charter commits all Members to\r\ntake separate and joint action to promote universal respect\r\nfor, and observance of, human rights. This is closely\r\nrelated to broad obligations regarding Non-Self-Governing\r\nTerritories. Sad to say, however, these goals of the\r\nCharter remain largely unrealized, despite dedicated and\r\npersistent efforts on the part of United Nations Members\r\nover many years. Indeed, brave people have laid down\r\ntheir lives in the service of the United Nations in pursuing\r\nthese goals, and we honour them here. Their sacrifices are\r\nnot in vain.\r\nIt is our hope that during the next 50 years strides\r\ncan be made in achieving better harmony between the\r\ninevitable considerations of national self-interest and the\r\nlegitimate rights and expectations of the less empowered\r\npeople of the world. I fully realize that even today such\r\na statement sounds idealistic, and that is the problem we\r\nface. Nevertheless, only in such a context can real life be\r\nbreathed into sections of the Charter that have not been\r\nadequately addressed during the first 50 years.\r\nThe accomplishments of the United Nations up to\r\nnow as a forum for the advancement of world peace and\r\nsecurity cannot be minimized, and I salute those\r\naccomplishments while recognizing the work that remains.\r\nBut this Organization has an even greater mission. As\r\npopulations grow and make increasing demands on the\r\nlimited resources of our planet, even the most richly\r\nendowed among us must come to understand the great,\r\nfuturistic vision of the Charter. It wisely calls upon\r\npeoples and Governments large and small, rich and poor,\r\nto incorporate in their policies and actions true respect for\r\nthe right of all, including the least privileged among us,\r\nto live in conditions of decency and equality.\r\nThis challenge is not only for the developed world,\r\nbut applies equally to developing nations. It is not a\r\nsimplistic call for more North/South assistance. Instead,\r\nit seeks a universal awakening to the single most\r\nimportant reality of our lives today. This reality is that all\r\nour interests become more closely linked with each\r\npassing generation. We all have responsibilities if we are\r\nto turn back the consequences of our past selfish\r\nbehaviour. The destruction of war, the improper\r\nstewardship of our natural resources, the pollution of our\r\nliving space, the diminishment of our biological diversity\r\nand the havoc we will wreak upon the very climate of our\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nplanet, will all combine to overwhelm the Earth’s\r\npopulation unless we find common ground.\r\nThat common ground exists. It exists here. It does not\r\nask us to surrender our nationhood or our culture. It is the\r\nCharter of the United Nations — a visionary document that\r\nhas achieved much in its 50 years, and provides a format\r\nfor our very survival. God grant that we will have the\r\ncourage to build on it.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bailey Olter, President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President\r\nof the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Clerides: As we are commemorating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, I consider it my\r\nsolemn obligation to pay tribute, on behalf of the people\r\nand the Government of Cyprus, to the founders of our\r\nOrganization, whose vision and determination made its\r\ncreation possible, and to encourage and congratulate all of\r\nus who take part in this Organization.\r\nThe world Organization, born out of the ashes of the\r\nSecond World War, has, despite the vicissitudes of the cold\r\nwar and the present turbulent world situation, achieved\r\nadmirable results. The vital issues of decolonization, peace-\r\nkeeping, human rights, democratization, development and\r\nthe codification of international law have been addressed\r\nwith considerable success. On the other hand, efforts\r\ntowards global peace and security, the primary\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations, have had varied\r\nresults. The much hoped-for peace dividend from the\r\ndemise of the cold war, has unfortunately eluded us, and\r\nnumerous ethnic conflicts exert, as a result, their daily\r\nheavy toll on human life and produce material losses.\r\nAt the same time, some long-standing problems,\r\nincluding the problem of the invasion and occupation of\r\npart of the territory of my country by Turkey, have\r\nremained unresolved for years.\r\nSuch situations give rise to questions regarding the\r\nvalidity of the United Nations Charter and the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization.\r\nThe United Nations Charter, a great human\r\nachievement, embodying the wisdom and vision of the\r\ndrafters to save succeeding generations from the scourge\r\nof war, constitutes the legal and moral foundation for\r\ninternational relations, and is as valid and relevant today\r\nas ever.\r\nWhat is really needed is to reduce the gap between\r\nprinciple and practice created by the failure to apply\r\nobjectively and universally the provisions of the Charter,\r\nthus causing insecurity, frustration and bitterness. It is\r\nalso essential to uphold the authority of the Organization\r\nagainst those who flout international opinion as expressed\r\nin United Nations resolutions.\r\nWe are now witnessing the ever growing and\r\ndramatic direct engagement of the United Nations in the\r\ncomplex maintenance of international peace and security\r\nin our ever changing, interdependent world. Because of\r\nthese challenges and those that lie ahead, we must deal on\r\na priority basis with the very important issues of\r\nrevitalizing, both financially and otherwise, reforming and\r\nstrengthening our Organization so that it may become a\r\nmore potent instrument in the service of mankind, in\r\nwhose name it was created.\r\nThe human genius that was enlisted in the cause of\r\npeace immediately after the Second World War is called\r\nupon to face new challenges in the cause of peace,\r\ndevelopment and cooperation between nations.\r\nPerhaps no tribute to our Organization would be\r\nmore fitting than to recommit ourselves to the everlasting\r\nprinciples and ideals of the United Nations Charter and\r\njoin in determined efforts, now and in the years that lie\r\nahead, to invigorate both our institutions and our own\r\nresolve for the promotion of the universal aspirations for\r\npeace, justice and cooperation between the countries and\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nThe Republic of Cyprus pledges its determination to\r\nmake every effort so that the activities of the United\r\nNations will be further expanded, its principles and values\r\nuniversally applied and its resolutions fully complied\r\nwith. We pledge our resolve to defend the principles and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nideals of the United Nations, the Organization whose\r\nfiftieth anniversary we so proudly and solemnly celebrate\r\ntoday.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Cyprus for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Armando Calderón Sol,\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Armando Calderón Sol,\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Armando Calderón Sol, President\r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Calderón Sol (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nFifty years ago, the destruction and suffering caused by two\r\nworld wars led us to reflect deeply and join together to\r\ncreate the United Nations, an Organization intended to\r\nmaintain international peace and security and foster justice,\r\ndignity, human well-being, understanding and cooperation\r\nbetween nations.\r\nThe international order of the post-war period was\r\nmarked by antagonism and ideological confrontation. None\r\nthe less, the United Nations attained important and\r\nsubstantial achievements, outstanding among which were its\r\nsignificant contributions to avoiding another world war with\r\nunimaginable consequences, eliminating colonialism and\r\nracial discrimination, encouraging the codification of\r\ninternational law, strengthening the international system of\r\nhuman rights protection and promoting international\r\ncooperation for the improvement of the political, economic\r\nand social conditions of our peoples.\r\nAfter so many years of tension and insecurity in the\r\nbipolar era, the world has become a substantially different\r\nplace because of the deep-going transformations it has\r\nundergone. The cold war is over, the geopolitical map has\r\nbeen radically altered, a worldwide democratization process\r\nhas emerged, cooperation has replaced confrontation and a\r\nglobalization process has begun in the political, economic,\r\nsocial and environmental spheres.\r\nIn the light of today’s international reality, we are\r\nconvinced that the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations are uniquely valid. This is the only universal\r\nsystem that States can trust to study and implement\r\nmeasures for the attainment of common goals of\r\nhumanity — with the necessary understanding that\r\nMember States have the responsibility to provide this\r\nintergovernmental Organization with the means and\r\nresources needed to reach its objectives. In this regard,\r\nthe United Nations must deepen the comprehensive\r\nmodernization process that will enable it to rationalize the\r\nuse of its resources, while becoming more efficient and\r\ntransparent in the fulfilment of its functions.\r\nThe global agenda we have before us requires\r\nprompt and effective responses to the problems of\r\ndrugs — production, trafficking and consumption —\r\nterrorism, money-laundering, organized crime, corruption\r\nand all the other scourges afflicting humanity today. At\r\nthe successful conferences on human rights, environment,\r\npopulation, social development and women, organized by\r\nthe United Nations, we reached very important worldwide\r\ncommitments that should be properly followed up.\r\nThe eradication of poverty continues to be the main\r\nchallenge facing the Members of the Organization, and\r\nwe must not rest until we have broken the fateful cycle\r\nthat condemns those born into poverty to die in poverty.\r\nIn order to put a duly modernized United Nations in\r\nthe best position to respond effectively to the challenges\r\nit faces, it is essential that all Members have the political\r\nwill to meet their financial obligations.\r\nIn connection with the reform process of the\r\nOrganization, we are in favour of promoting opportunities\r\nfor participation and increasing representativity. For their\r\nvery survival, small States must usually be more creative,\r\nand that creativity could be put to better use if our right\r\nto more equitable participation in all the principal organs\r\nof the United Nations were respected. Similarly, the\r\nrepresentativity of the Security Council should be\r\naugmented to reflect the new structure of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization, we wish to reaffirm our confidence in the\r\nUnited Nations, especially because its cooperation enabled\r\nthe Salvadoran people to achieve peace and end a\r\nfratricidal conflict that had lasted more than 10 years. The\r\nsuccessful contribution of the United Nations to the\r\nreconciliation process in El Salvador has served to\r\nstrengthen our commitment to the principles inspiring it.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nWe hope that the Declaration adopted at this Special\r\nMeeting will constitute an unescapable commitment by all\r\nMember States of the Organization to fulfil its purposes and\r\nprinciples and achieve its goals of lasting peace and a better\r\nworld for future generations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof El Salvador for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Armando Calderón Sol, President\r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Antonio Mascarenhas\r\nMonteiro, President of the Republic of Cape Verde\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Antonio Mascarenhas\r\nMonteiro, President of the Republic of Cape Verde.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cape Verde, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Monteiro (spoke in Portuguese; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): First of all, Sir, I wish to\r\ntell you how pleased I am by your election to the\r\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly\r\nand, at the same time, I wish to express my firm belief that\r\nyour well-known personal qualities and extensive\r\nexperience will guarantee that you will lead the work of our\r\nOrganization in an effective and decisive manner.\r\nSimilarly, I wish to convey our sincere appreciation to\r\nyour predecessor, a distinguished son of a fraternal country,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, whose\r\nleadership of the forty-ninth session was a valuable asset in\r\nthe performance of the United Nations.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali,\r\nI reiterate my warmest tribute for his devoted performance\r\nof his duties; he deserves the international community’s\r\nappreciation and respect for this.\r\nThis Special Commemorative Meeting on the occasion\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is of\r\nundeniable importance and significance. This is no mere\r\ncelebration. The representatives of our countries have a\r\ncrucial task before them: to assess the course taken in the\r\npast half-century and, more important, to assess the future\r\nof our Organization. We are at the dawn of a new era, with\r\nnew challenges and different demands.\r\nWe must make a new commitment to the future and,\r\ntherefore, to the future of our Organization. We should,\r\nthus, reaffirm our unequivocal will to continue to fulfil\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations. Today,\r\nafter 50 years, it is legitimate to conclude that the United\r\nNations has been able to accomplish its mission. Hence,\r\nnobody would know how to define our present world\r\nwithout the United Nations, taking into account not only\r\nits role in promoting and facilitating the great, imperative\r\nchanges, but also its specific action in the most diverse\r\nfields of human accomplishment, both individually and\r\ncollectively.\r\nAs for peace, the United Nations has an effective\r\ncapacity for conceptualization and action, but it needs to\r\nbe improved. This cannot be delayed in view of the new\r\nsituation that has occurred since the disappearance of the\r\nold East-West confrontation. The current reality requires\r\nfirm leadership on the part of the United Nations to\r\npreserve peace and security in such a way that, in the\r\ncontext of observance of the values and rules of\r\ninternational law, all Member States, big and small, will\r\nfocus their abilities and energy on the promotion of the\r\nwell-being to which all peoples have a right.\r\nTherefore, it is essential to underline that\r\ndevelopment is a vital issue for humanity and I strongly\r\nbelieve that no efforts will succeed without a framework\r\nin which peace is an overriding value. Peace and\r\ndevelopment are components of the same struggle — a\r\ncommon struggle requiring, thus, the commitment of the\r\ninternational community as a whole, on the assumption\r\nthat what is at stake is the future of humanity.\r\nFrom the combat against desertification and drought\r\nto the protection of the global environment, from poverty\r\neradication to the prevention and management of intra-\r\nand inter-State conflicts, from addressing demographic\r\nproblems to the solution of related refugee and dislocated\r\npersons issues, from the perplexing condition of women\r\nto social development strategies, from international crime\r\nprevention to respect for and promotion of human rights:\r\nthese are just a few examples of fields requiring the\r\ncontribution of all those who truly believe in and wish for\r\na better world.\r\nIn sum, this is a burden we should not transmit to\r\nfuture generations. We must commit ourselves to\r\nefficient, long-term strategies. Yet, in the present context\r\nof economic globalization, it is important to overcome the\r\ndeficit in cooperation and coordination; this is so\r\nnecessary to ensuring the viability and cohesiveness of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\ninternational life. This is a priority in the objectives and\r\ngoals of the United Nations.\r\nFurthermore, our Organization must, above all, reflect\r\nthe present world with its own dynamics and intrinsic\r\nbalance. This is how the ongoing reform process should be\r\naddressed. Continuing consideration should be given to\r\nfinancial matters so that problems in this area do not impair\r\nour ability to act, in particular, in development.\r\nEnhanced lucidity and courage should guide us in our\r\nendeavours to promote reform leading to equality of rights\r\namong States, as well as transparency and democratization\r\nof the United Nations, particularly in the Security Council.\r\nWe must overcome the gap between provisions in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the palpable reality that we\r\nexperience internationally. We should not close our eyes or\r\nbe satisfied with half-solutions; rather, we should be\r\ncreative and daring. Let us seize this historic, changing\r\nmomentum.\r\nAn organization cannot be and cannot do anything\r\nother than what its Member States want it to be or to do.\r\nThis is, therefore, the only way the United Nations can\r\ncontinue to be, at the dawn of the third millennium, an\r\nindispensable tool of the international community, the tool\r\nthat we celebrate today and we bequeath to coming\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe President thanked the President of the Republic of\r\nCape Verde for his statement; His Excellency Mr.\r\nAntonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Bill Hayden,\r\nA.C., Governor-General of Australia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency The Honourable Bill Hayden,\r\nGovernor-General of Australia.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Bill Hayden, A.C.,\r\nGovernor-General of Australia, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Hayden: As I stand here today before\r\nrepresentatives of nearly every nation on earth, I am deeply\r\nconscious that the world is a very different place from the\r\none which, 50 years ago, gave birth to the United Nations.\r\nAs delegates in San Francisco in June 1945 prepared to\r\nsign the Charter of the United Nations, most of Europe\r\nand a great deal of Asia stood in ruins. Over 48 million\r\npeople had died and the survivors of the greatest conflict\r\nin human history asked themselves what could be done to\r\nstop such a catastrophe from ever happening again.\r\nTheir answer was to create an organization which\r\nsought to enshrine the universal values of tolerance, social\r\nprogress and respect for human dignity within\r\ninternational machinery; to ensure that all peoples and all\r\nnations, whether large or small, could be spared the\r\nscourge of war and provided the conditions for economic\r\nand social advancement.\r\nThe founders of the United Nations were not able to\r\nprevent war completely, either in their time or,\r\nregrettably, in ours. But the past 50 years have not seen\r\nglobal conflicts again and for that the United Nations can\r\nclaim no small share. It has also been a time of\r\nunparalleled progress in a wide range of areas, some of\r\nwhich is immediately recognizable as the work of the\r\nUnited Nations but much of which has brought to the\r\nOrganization only rare recognition.\r\nThe United Nations has played a crucial role in the\r\npursuit of arms control, in developing the infrastructure\r\nfor the global nuclear-safeguards system and in\r\nidentifying and defining international human rights. The\r\nUnited Nations has done much to promote economic and\r\nsocial development, to work to improve the status of\r\nwomen, provide humanitarian and disaster relief, and\r\ntackle head-on — with remarkable success — world\r\nhealth problems. And, as one of its greatest achievements,\r\nthe United Nations has played a central role in\r\ndecolonization and in the exercise by hundreds of millions\r\nof people of the right of self-determination.\r\nI recall with pride Australia’s contribution to the\r\nfounding of the United Nations, because of the central\r\nrole played by Australia’s then Foreign Minister, Mr.\r\nHerbert Vere Evatt. While Australia’s primary goal for\r\nthe United Nations in 1945 was the creation of a system\r\nin which conflicts between nations could be settled\r\npeacefully, in accordance with accepted international legal\r\nprinciples, Mr. Evatt argued, with great effect, that the\r\npolitical activity of the United Nations would not be\r\nenough by itself to prevent future conflicts and that the\r\nmore fundamental causes of the world’s problems would\r\nhave to be tackled if international peace and stability were\r\nto be guaranteed.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nThe Government of Australia believes that, while the\r\nnature of the threats to global security and stability have\r\nchanged dramatically since the Charter came into force 50\r\nyears ago, the Charter is as relevant today as it was in 1945\r\nand that we need look no further than to a reaffirmation of\r\nits goals and objectives to guide the United Nations in the\r\nnext millennium.\r\nThe challenge the United Nations faces now, and into\r\nthe next century, is to reintegrate the functions of the\r\nOrganization in the way the founders intended, to avoid the\r\nsterile and rigid division of peace and security issues,\r\ndevelopment issues and human-rights and justice issues. As\r\nMr. Evatt and the other founders of the United Nations\r\nrecognized, international peace and — perhaps more\r\nappropriately in our day and age — peace within States\r\nmust be based on an inextricable linking of the concept of\r\npeace and security and the concept of development. If\r\nhuman needs for dignity and liberty are not met, all the\r\nmaterial gain imaginable is unlikely to lead to sustainable\r\npeace. Peace without freedom, without dignity and without\r\nbasic human rights is forlorn, barren and, at best,\r\ntemporary.\r\nChange and adaptation in the United Nations presents\r\nnew challenges, which will require innovative solutions.\r\nThe United Nations can only do what its Member States\r\nallow it to do, and a reintegrated, revitalized United Nations\r\nneeds not only to lead new thinking on the part of its\r\nMember States but also to reflect new thinking. Any path\r\nforward must take account of that two-way process.\r\nMoreover, we must not forget that if the United\r\nNations is to work in the way we want it to, it must be\r\nprovided with appropriate resources, and ultimately we\r\nmust be prepared to pay for it. In the short term, this means\r\nthat Member States must pay their assessed contributions in\r\nfull and on time. Sadly, however, there are Member States\r\nthat are in arrears not because they are unable to pay but\r\nbecause they are unwilling to do so. Beyond this, it is the\r\nAustralian Government’s view that if we are to address the\r\nlonger-term problem of how to pay for the United Nations\r\nwe must look seriously at the options that exist for\r\nsupplementing Member States’ contributions by external\r\nsources of finance. To overcome the present and likely\r\ncontinuing financial crisis of the United Nations, clear-\r\nsighted and innovative thinking is necessary in an\r\nexamination of the entire issue of its funding.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary should be a time to resolve\r\nwhat it is we can do for the United Nations — not what we\r\ncannot do. We must act cooperatively, decisively and\r\nquickly to chart a way forward which will ensure that\r\nfuture generations inherit a world free from the threat of\r\nwar and free from the curse of want and inequity — a\r\nworld which is a living reaffirmation of the fundamental\r\nand inalienable dignity and worth of humankind.\r\nThe President: I thank the Governor-General of\r\nAustralia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Bill Hayden, A.C.,\r\nGovernor-General of Australia, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé,\r\nPresident of the Central African Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé,\r\nPresident of the Central African Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé, President of\r\nthe Central African Republic, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Patassé (interpretation from French): I\r\ncannot contain my feelings on this exceptional occasion,\r\nwhen the nations of the world are assembled here to\r\ntestify, equally with the many others who have spoken, to\r\nthe long road that has been travelled since the signing of\r\nthe Charter in San Francisco.\r\nToday, on the occasion of the jubilee of our\r\nOrganization, which is characterized by the density of its\r\nhistory and especially by its experiences, it is more than\r\never appropriate for the international community to draw\r\nthe necessary lessons on which to base new hope, but\r\nespecially, and above all, through which to fulfil the\r\ngrand design of the Organization, in the interests of our\r\npeoples.\r\nIn the light of recent achievements, we pay tribute\r\nhere to the perseverance of our elders, which led to the\r\ndismantling of apartheid and, especially, to a glimmer of\r\nhope of a final settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict. It is our hope that the same will happen in\r\nrespect of the various conflicts, latent or acknowledged,\r\nwhich cry out to the United Nations by revealing to the\r\ninternational community the barbarities and atrocities\r\nwhich, unfortunately, we are still witnessing on this the\r\nthreshold of the twenty-first century.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nThis is why it is reasonable for us to think that the end\r\nof the cold war ought to herald the end of an epoch and the\r\nadvent of a new world characterized by tolerance,\r\nhumanism and solidarity so that there might be more justice\r\nand peace among peoples and nations.\r\nHence, it must be emphasized that it appears unfair to\r\ncertain nations that an Organization which wishes to be\r\nuniversal and democratic excludes other nations from its\r\ndecision-making bodies. This being the case, it is a matter\r\nof urgency that the Security Council be expanded and that\r\nthe United Nations system be decentralized so that there\r\ncan be a better response to the sensitivities of the peoples\r\nmaking up the Organization.\r\nWe pay tribute to the United Nations for its efforts to\r\nsupport all transition towards constitutional legality, and\r\nespecially its unshakeable opposition to any desire to revert\r\nto dictatorship, whether civilian, military, semi-\r\nconstitutional or autocratic.\r\nWe draw the international community’s attention to\r\nthe very special efforts that we should like to see made on\r\nAfrica’s behalf. Indeed, if there can be no sustainable\r\ndevelopment without democracy, neither can there be\r\ndemocracy without economic and social development.\r\nAfrica is therefore resolutely committed to the path of\r\ndemocracy. Today more than ever, the international\r\ncommunity must mobilize itself to promote a new\r\ninternational economic order that honours human dignity\r\nand supports Africa’s efforts to overcome the obstacles it\r\nfaces: institutional under-representation; a low participation\r\nin international trade; a weak capacity for investment\r\nbecause of the burden of domestic and external debt; and\r\nabove all, the cost of establishing new institutions in States\r\nthat have just successfully completed their transition to\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThat is why, in keeping with the statement I made\r\nhere in 1994, I repeat my desire to see the establishment of\r\na genuine Marshall Plan for the development of Africa in\r\norder to support the irreversible democratic conviction of\r\nour peoples.\r\nTo the sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nwe repledge our firm support for his work and our sincere\r\nfaith in the United Nations, guarantor of universal peace,\r\nsecurity and global well-being. We wish to see greater\r\ndetermination to combat injustice and more democratic\r\nrigour to preserve the universal mission of our\r\nOrganization, particularly in putting an end to the tensions\r\nbetween the two Chinas and the two Koreas.\r\nLong live our common Organization and may the\r\ntwenty-first century be more peaceful and more conducive\r\nto progress for all humanity.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé, President of\r\nthe Central African Republic, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mukar Cholponbayev,\r\nChairman of the Legislative Chamber of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Mukar Cholponbayev,\r\nChairman of the Legislative Chamber of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mukar Cholponbayev, Chairman\r\nof the Legislative Chamber of the Kyrgyz Republic,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Cholponbayev (interpretation from Russian):\r\nIt is a great honour for me to represent my country at this\r\nhistoric Meeting of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations. Drawing lessons from the tragic mistakes of the\r\npast, the Organization was created so that we might join\r\nforces in providing mankind with the future it deserves.\r\nAs representatives of an ancient people but a young\r\nnation, and reflecting on our own history and the half-\r\ncentury of efforts to create a new code of international\r\ncooperation, we express today our profound gratitude to\r\nthe founding fathers of the United Nations. Thanks to\r\ntheir efforts, the world community has been successful in\r\ninterrupting the tragic cycle of world wars. Today our\r\ndiscussions cover not the problems of global war, but\r\nrather global development.\r\nAlthough we hear criticisms of the United Nations\r\nfrom various directions, we are united in our commitment\r\nto its goals and principles. This shows that the United\r\nNations is a living body and that it is needed by all of us.\r\nLet us then join our efforts to make it more effective and\r\nmore responsive to the contemporary challenges facing\r\nmankind.\r\nMy country highly appreciates the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations in providing support to countries that have\r\nonly recently achieved independence. We see our future\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nas linked to the mainstream of global development. We\r\nhave chosen the path of democracy and radical economic\r\nreform. At the moment, preparations for presidential\r\nelections, in accordance with democratic principles, are\r\nunder way in my country. This step underscores our faith\r\nin the ideals of freedom and democracy.\r\nWe are grateful to the General Assembly for its\r\nsupport for our celebration this year of the thousandth\r\nanniversary of our national epic Manas, which reflects the\r\nhumanistic vision of our people in harmony with the ideals\r\nof the United Nations. In consideration of this support, the\r\npeople and Government of my country are presenting the\r\nUnited Nations with a sculpture of our national hero,\r\nManas. This gift will be presented to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali, as a symbol of our hopes for solidarity\r\nand brotherhood among the peoples of the world.\r\nThe world has changed radically in the past 50 years\r\nand we believe that it will follow the path of solidarity,\r\nmutual trust, tolerance and cooperation. In this connection,\r\nour Organization should be restructured to meet the\r\nchallenges of the new post-cold-war era. We support the\r\nproposals made here concerning the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, the main aim of which is to make this\r\nimportant body more effective. While paying tribute to the\r\nrole of the nuclear and economically powerful countries in\r\nresolving problems of security and social and economic\r\ndevelopment, we are not in favour of turning it into a club\r\nfor the rich and powerful. Moral force, alongside other\r\nconsiderations, should be imperative in the Council’s work.\r\nWe sympathize with the feelings experienced by small\r\ncountries in the world community. Here the key to the\r\nproblem lies in reaffirming the principle of interdependence\r\nin the world. The large countries cannot enjoy material and\r\nspiritual prosperity until they recognize that they are part of\r\nthe same world as smaller countries. This logical\r\ncombination of realism and idealism is the basis for mutual\r\nunderstanding and accord in the future.\r\nYes, the United Nations today is far from ideal. The\r\nmain reason why a world war has been avoided is the fear\r\nof nuclear catastrophe. But we have yet to grasp the\r\ncatastrophe threatening humanity from persistent prejudice\r\nin our mutual relations, estrangement, and national\r\nselfishness. Today, in the final count, peace and prosperity\r\nalike are indivisible. There can be no expectation of a\r\nlasting universal peace while factors giving rise to hatred,\r\nintolerance and conflict persist. At the epicentre of many\r\ncalamities lie such detonators as poverty, feelings of hurt\r\nnational pride, and social and psychological tension. In this\r\nregard, we would like to see the United Nations as an\r\ninternational mechanism for preventing catastrophes rather\r\nthan fighting their consequences. When raising the issue\r\nof global well-being one cannot ignore the overall aspect\r\nof regional cooperation: the problems of ecology, security\r\nand drug trafficking require the joint efforts of all\r\ninterested parties. Our country is prepared to cooperate in\r\nthese efforts with the United Nations and its Members.\r\nThe strength of the United Nations is in us — its\r\nMembers. The efficiency and authority of our\r\nOrganization depend on our own will and trust, our\r\npolitical and financial support and skilled human\r\nresources. My country, as a new Member, is ready to\r\nbring to the next 50 years of the United Nations its\r\npeacefulness and good will, its energy and enthusiasm and\r\nits knowledge and experience. We believe in the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the\r\nLegislative Chamber of the Kyrgyz Republic for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mukar Cholponbayev, Chairman\r\nof the Legislative Chamber of the Kyrgyz Republic,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Dahuku Péré,\r\nPresident of the National Assembly of the Togolese\r\nRepublic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Dahuku Péré, President\r\nof the National Assembly of the Togolese Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dahuku Péré, President of the\r\nNational Assembly of the Togolese Republic, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Péré (interpretation from French): At this\r\nsolemn time, when our community is paying tribute to the\r\nmajor figures who created the United Nations, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of which we are celebrating, I would like, on\r\nbehalf of the Head of State of Togo, His Excellency\r\nGnassingbé Eyadema, to convey his greetings and express\r\nthe joy and just pride that I feel, in speaking on behalf of\r\nTogo. The importance of this event, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary, deserves to be celebrated at the Special\r\nCommemorative Session.\r\nIn my country, this event has a very special\r\ncharacter, for two reasons. First, as a former ward of the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nUnited Nations, Togo, to some extent, owes its accession to\r\ninternational sovereignty to the United Nations. In this\r\nrespect, it is appropriate to commemorate this anniversary\r\nin a significant way, and this, subsequently, has justified the\r\nfact that I am participating in this ceremony on behalf of\r\nour Head of State.\r\nThe people of Togo and their President would like\r\nhere to express their profound gratitude to the international\r\ncommunity for the inestimable support they gave to Togo\r\nin its struggle to affirm its identity and personality in order\r\nto meet its destiny by becoming independent.\r\nOn this solemn occasion, my country renews its firm\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations. This solemn meeting offers us an opportunity to\r\nthink about the major problems facing the world. Coming\r\nas it does at the end of the cold war, this fiftieth\r\nanniversary gives Member States an opportunity to\r\nstrengthen the friendship and solidarity among their peoples\r\nso that a new approach in relations can emerge, truly based\r\non the independence and equality of States. Henceforth,\r\nthese relations should develop as part of a dynamic\r\npartnership based essentially on independence.\r\nA rapid survey of the activities of our Organization\r\nover the last 50 years shows that while it has allowed the\r\nworld to escape a world war of a scope comparable to the\r\nlast two wars, the effects of which traumatized humanity,\r\nour Organization has not fulfilled our hopes — either in the\r\narea of peace-keeping or in the area of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Indeed, despite the enormous means invested\r\nin safeguarding and restoring regional and international\r\npeace and security, this goal is far from being achieved.\r\nThe world is witness to new armed conflicts the end of\r\nwhich cannot be foreseen. In the light of the lessons drawn\r\nfrom the experience of peace-keeping operations, it is\r\nimportant, in my country’s view, to strengthen the\r\ncapability of the United Nations in the area of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nWith respect to the reforms we are thinking about, we\r\nmight more actively involve the General Assembly, which\r\nis fully representative of the international community when\r\nthe modes of settlement prescribed by Chapter VI of the\r\nCharter are applied.\r\nWith regard to restructuring the Security Council, we\r\nmust take into account the claims of a number of States\r\nwhich would like to have equitable representation in that\r\nbody, so that its composition might reflect today’s\r\ninternational realities, and so that the management of\r\ninternational peace and security would no longer fall\r\nwithin the competence only of the major Powers.\r\nEconomically speaking, we must deplore the fact\r\nthat efforts to date have not made it possible to meet the\r\nchallenges on the road to development and to improve the\r\nwell-being of the populations in the South. It is a fact that\r\nthe progress registered in the countries of the North and\r\nthe stability of the world cannot be consolidated if the\r\ninternational community does not more firmly commit\r\nitself to the eradication of poverty, misery and illiteracy.\r\nIt is now a matter of correcting the inadmissible\r\nimbalances that characterize the economic relations\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries, and\r\nthereby bring about justice and fairness.\r\nSimilarly, it is a matter of pressing urgency to\r\nreform the international financial and monetary system in\r\norder to improve the international economic environment,\r\nbearing in mind the deep aspirations of the majority of\r\nthe peoples of the world.\r\nThe goals that our Organization has set for itself\r\ncannot be achieved without adequate economic support or\r\nwithout real solidarity between the rich and the poor\r\ncountries. These things are interdependent and mutually\r\nreinforcing.\r\nThis constantly changing world is far from being the\r\none that could provide the vital minimum that all\r\nhumanity needs in order to survive. Our Organization is\r\nobliged to redouble its efforts to achieve the goals of\r\njustice and fairness. In order to do so, we must explore\r\nand exploit as best we can all the possibilities which\r\nagencies and institutions have — be they subregional,\r\nregional or international — in order to ensure peace on\r\nthe one hand, and on the other hand to ensure economic\r\nrelations solidly based on partnership.\r\nAfter 50 years, we must be able to affirm that,\r\nthanks to the United Nations, the course of history has\r\nprofoundly changed for humanity. This change will bring\r\nfurther happiness to humanity if the efforts made by the\r\nUnited Nations can be adapted to the new international\r\ncontext. That is the only way that we will be able to\r\naccomplish our noble missions.\r\nPeople throughout the world, while lauding the scope\r\nof the work already done by the United Nations to bring\r\nabout peace and solidarity among peoples, expect that it\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nwill meet their deepest aspirations better in the next 50\r\nyears than it has done in the last 50 years.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the National\r\nAssembly of the Togolese Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dahuku Péré, President of the\r\nNational Assembly of the Togolese Republic, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Owen\r\nArthur, M.P., Prime Minister and Minister for Finance\r\nand Economic Affairs of Barbados\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Honourable Owen Arthur,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance and Economic\r\nAffairs of Barbados.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Owen Arthur, M.P.,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance and\r\nEconomic Affairs of Barbados, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Arthur: The adoption of the Charter, by\r\nconsensus, at the United Nations Conference on\r\nInternational Organization in San Francisco in 1945,\r\nrepresents one of the great moments of history. Today we\r\nare celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, which embodied the hopes and aspirations of a\r\nworld devastated by war. The vision of global cooperation\r\nenshrined in the new world Organization blossomed and\r\nmatured into an extensive network of institutions — the\r\nUnited Nations system — whose service to humanity has\r\ntouched the daily lives of people in every corner of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe United Nations has built a proud record of\r\naccomplishments. It has become our best hope for\r\npromoting global peace and security, even as it fashions a\r\nbody of international law that enables global\r\ninterdependence, cooperation and communications.\r\nThis Organization, particularly through its specialized\r\nagencies, has coordinated international efforts against\r\ndisease, hunger and suffering. It has promoted democracy\r\nand economic and social justice, and, to this end, has\r\nprovided a universal mechanism for charting international\r\neconomic and social policy.\r\nAnd within the process of decolonization, the United\r\nNations has not only secured the dismantling of apartheid,\r\nbut has also played a significant role in ensuring that\r\nmore than 60 countries — many of which, like Barbados,\r\nare small and vulnerable — have achieved their\r\nindependence.\r\nBarbados salutes the leadership provided by the\r\ndistinguished Secretaries-General and the dedicated staff\r\nwho have served with distinction the noble mission of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThese accomplishments must not blur the real\r\ndifficulties or complexity of the tasks that have\r\nconfronted, and continue to confront, this Organization.\r\nMany setbacks have occurred along the way. In moments\r\nof frustration and disappointment, we have even\r\nwondered, often aloud, if the United Nations has failed\r\nus, perhaps forgetting that our United Nations represents\r\nno more and no less than the collective will of our\r\nGovernments, which it serves.\r\nLooking ahead, the United Nations of the next 50\r\nyears must embark on its unfinished journey, reformed\r\nand re-energized, to meet the challenges of a world of\r\ntumultuous global change. Barbados reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the ideals of the Charter, which will guide\r\nus on this journey.\r\nThe reformed United Nations must construct a new\r\nsystem of security along the lines contained in “An\r\nAgenda for Peace”, to reflect the changed nature of\r\ntoday’s conflicts, conflicts mainly within nations rather\r\nthan between nations. It must accelerate and intensify its\r\ndevelopment mission. In particular, it must respond with\r\ndispatch to the cry and suffering of the world’s poor,\r\nwhose plight weighs heavily on the conscience of the\r\ninternational community. It must implement the wide-\r\nranging Programmes of Action created by the continuum\r\nof United Nations conferences, from Rio to Beijing; and,\r\nof special significance, the Bridgetown Declaration on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. Should it do so, we can contemplate a happier\r\nfuture, in which nations live in peace, diverse cultures\r\nflourish in harmony, and all people enjoy freedom and\r\nmaterial well-being.\r\nThe United Nations remains a special place for small\r\nisland developing States. Often buffeted by both natural\r\nand man-made disasters and by the economic dislocations\r\nof globalization, they look to the United Nations for\r\nprotection and support. For Barbados, this United\r\nNations — even though less than perfect — is still our\r\ngreatest hope for peace, development and social justice.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance and Economic Affairs of Barbados for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Owen Arthur, M.P.,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance and\r\nEconomic Affairs of Barbados, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nManuel Esquivel, Prime Minister of Belize\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Right Honourable Manuel\r\nEsquivel, Prime Minister of Belize.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Manuel\r\nEsquivel, Prime Minister of Belize, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Esquivel: Fifty years ago world leaders gathered\r\nin San Francisco to declare their determination to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nSucceeding generations, including our own, have seen\r\ncontinuing progress in addressing the issues set out in that\r\nopening paragraph of the Preamble to our Charter. We\r\napplaud the successes, even as we must pledge to correct\r\nthe failures.\r\nWe must recognize that the preoccupations of 1945 are\r\nnot necessarily those of the present generation. The 50\r\noriginal signatories to the Charter could not have foreseen\r\nthat 50 years later this world Organization would consist of\r\nMember States with populations ranging from 1 billion to\r\n16,000 people.\r\nIt is easy to understand that war and the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes would have been the number one\r\npriority in 1945. I suggest that in 1995 priority number one\r\nis to be found not in the Preamble to the Charter, nor even\r\nin Article 1, but rather in Article 2, which states that this\r\n“Organization is based on ... the sovereign equality of\r\nall its Members.”\r\nIn 1945 Members probably regarded that statement as self-\r\nevident. Today, as the large and powerful sit side by side\r\nwith the small and vulnerable, the principle of sovereign\r\nequality is a difficult pill for some and an elusive goal for\r\nothers.\r\nWe must confess that equality presents this\r\nOrganization with a vast amount of unfinished business.\r\nAlthough the provisions of the Charter refer to the equal\r\nrights of nations large and small, it is troubling that\r\nduring these 50 years this Organization has not\r\nsystematically constructed edifices to enshrine equality.\r\nToo often the word is used in a rhetorical manner. As we\r\nall know, there is a formal equality, which connotes non-\r\ndiscrimination or liberalized access, and there is\r\nsubstantive equality, which connotes tangible benefit.\r\nEven in the formal sense, equality among Member States\r\nhas been generally treated as a distant aspiration. Even\r\nour elaborate resolutions for human rights too often\r\nprovide shelter for discriminatory practices, even in the\r\nareas with which we have been most preoccupied, such as\r\ncivil and political rights.\r\nIn the political realm, despite this Organization’s\r\nsuccess in destroying the ramparts of colonialism, I regret\r\nthat the embers of formal inequality burn very bright in\r\nthe composition of the Security Council, the most vital\r\norgan for peace and security. It is time that we amended\r\nthe Charter to guarantee that we will hear the important\r\nvoice of small Member States and of all geographic\r\nregions in both echelons of membership of the Council.\r\nIn the social field, the Organization has only just\r\nbegan systematically to address such issues as full\r\nemployment, social integration and poverty, in the\r\nnational and international context. Clearly, we need to\r\nrecognize that formal equality must here play an\r\nimportant part.\r\nWe have been most active about enshrining formal\r\nequality for nations in matters of trade and economics.\r\nHowever, when we inquire why this is so, we must\r\nconfess that this doctrine seeks not so much to benefit all\r\nthe nations and peoples, large and small, as much as it\r\nhappens to coincide with economic doctrines that are\r\ndesigned to serve the interests of the larger economies. It\r\nis for this reason that I must express my deep concern\r\nabout the pressure being brought to bear on smaller\r\nnations to join in the rush towards the new economic\r\northodoxy of free trade. For small, largely agricultural\r\neconomies to survive in a world of free trade, a level\r\nplaying field is not the only prerequisite for fair\r\ncompetition. The sporting metaphor that is more\r\nappropriate is that of the horse race, in which the stronger\r\nand more experienced bear a heavier load to help equalize\r\nthe potentials of the weaker and the less experienced.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nIn view of what I have just said, it is evident that the\r\ngoal of substantive equality for both individuals and groups\r\nis very distant. It is even possible that there does not yet\r\nexist a clear consensus that, 50 years from the foundation\r\nof this Organization, all human beings, all States and all\r\npeoples are truly created equal. As a matter of fact, in some\r\ncircles such a proposition might well still be considered\r\nheresy. After all, as we approach the twenty-first century,\r\nwe are still unable generally to accept the proposition that\r\npoverty is a global problem that requires global solutions.\r\nIn fact, many are unprepared to accept that human beings\r\nand nations are entitled to move steadily upward on\r\neconomic, social, political and cultural trajectories which\r\nwill provide genuine equality.\r\nMany sectors of first-world society are still at a level\r\nof evolution where they cannot accept the minimal\r\nobligation that those societies should effectively transfer a\r\nnominal 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official\r\ndevelopment assistance. In fact, this year the developed\r\nworld has allocated a mere 0.3 per cent of gross domestic\r\nproduct to development assistance, the lowest level since\r\n1973. Legal scholars still fail to accept that there may be a\r\nbinding legal obligation to provide development assistance\r\nor economic cooperation for the world’s betterment. Many\r\nof the world’s wealthiest nations fail to acknowledge a\r\nmoral obligation to help the poorest, or even to recognize\r\nthat their own continued wealth ultimately depends on the\r\ngrowth of the purchasing power of the 4.5 billion people\r\nliving in the world’s developing countries. Yet most of the\r\nsystems of religion and ethics that are represented in this\r\nHall today espouse credos which acknowledge or require a\r\nresponsible social conscience. I share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s fear, expressed in “An Agenda for Development”,\r\nthat\r\n“development as a common cause is in danger of\r\nfading from the forefront of our agenda”. (A/48/935,\r\npara. 5)\r\nEquality is the great unfinished business as much for\r\nthis Organization as for all humanity. It is incumbent on us,\r\nat this time and in this place, to revitalize the commitment\r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by\r\nresolving promptly to complete this unfinished business. In\r\nthat connection, let us recall the original intent of the\r\ncreators of the Charter of the United Nations, expressed or\r\nimplied even before the United Nations Charter, in the\r\nAtlantic Charter and other wartime documents, that freedom\r\nfrom fear and freedom from want are universal, indivisible,\r\ninterdependent and interrelated. Let us therefore resolve to\r\nvitalize and generalize the slogan of the recent World\r\nConference on Women: let there be equality, development\r\nand peace.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of Belize\r\nfor his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Manuel\r\nEsquivel, Prime Minister of Belize, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al-\r\nNahayan, Deputy Prime Minister and Special Envoy\r\nof the Head of State of the United Arab Emirates\r\nThe President: I now call on His Highness Sheikh\r\nSultan bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nSpecial Envoy of the Head of State of the United Arab\r\nEmirates.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al-Nahayan,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Special Envoy of the\r\nHead of State of the United Arab Emirates, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nSheikh Al-Nahayan (interpretation from Arabic): It\r\nis an honour for me to convey to you the blessings and\r\ngreetings of the President of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahayan, and\r\nof the Government and the people of the United Arab\r\nEmirates on this important occasion marking the passage\r\nof 50 years since the foundation of the United Nations.\r\nThe establishment of the United Nations was an\r\nimportant, historic turning-point in the lives of nations\r\nand peoples because of the Organization’s active role in\r\naffirming the right to self-determination, the achievement\r\nof economic and social development and the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMr. Dehaene (Prime Minister of Belgium), Vice-\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, took the Chair.\r\nOur participation in these celebrations clearly reflects\r\nour firm belief in the important and historic role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the establishment of a new era of\r\ninternational relations and in strengthening peace and\r\nsecurity, especially in the Arab region, a region that has\r\nbeen ravaged, over the past few decades, by numerous\r\nwars and conflicts that have consumed its material and\r\nhuman energy and resources. The peoples and countries\r\nof the region expect the United Nations to perform a\r\nlarger role in addressing the problems that resulted from\r\nthose wars and conflicts and in finding radical solutions\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nthat would lead to the realization of the hopes and\r\naspirations of the region’s peoples after peace, justice,\r\ndevelopment and stability.\r\nIn this context, the Iranian occupation of our three\r\nislands poses a direct threat to the security of the region in\r\ngeneral, and to that of the United Arab Emirates in\r\nparticular.\r\nOn this important occasion when all countries shall\r\nrenew their commitment to the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter and to the rules and norms of international law,\r\nwe reaffirm our resolute political will to strengthen the role\r\nand increase the effectiveness of the Organization and its\r\nspecialized agencies, in order for it to achieve the purposes\r\nfor which it was established: namely, the creation of a\r\nworld that would be free from war, repression, injustice and\r\npoverty. We reaffirm our position of principle against\r\nextremism, terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and the illicit trafficking in drugs, and call for\r\nthe liberalization of international trade in the interests of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nIt is our hope that these celebrations will be a step\r\ntowards evaluating the lessons of the past, and a new\r\ndeparture towards a bright future in which all mankind\r\nwould enjoy security, stability and development.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Special Envoy of\r\nthe Head of State of the United Arab Emirates for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al-Nahayan,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Special Envoy of the Head\r\nof State of the United Arab Emirates, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin\r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud, Second Deputy Prime Minister,\r\nMinister of Defence and Aviation and Inspector General\r\nof Saudi Arabia\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on His Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin\r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud, Second Deputy Prime Minister,\r\nMinister of Defence and Aviation and Inspector General of\r\nSaudi Arabia.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al\r\nSaud, Second Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of\r\nDefence and Aviation and Inspector General of\r\nSaudi Arabia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPrince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): It is with pleasure that I\r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly on\r\nbehalf of The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King\r\nFahd bin Abdulaziz, King of the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia, on his election to the presidency of the current\r\nsession, which coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations and, thereby, acquires special\r\nsignificance. His election is an expression of esteem for\r\nhim and for his country. I also wish to commend the\r\nefforts of His Excellency the Secretary-General in the\r\nservice of peace.\r\nAs I journeyed to New York to participate in this\r\nhistoric occasion, I reflected upon personal memories and\r\ngeneral impressions. Fifty years ago the late King Faisal,\r\nthen the Foreign Minister of my country, accompanied by\r\nKing Fahd, embarked upon a similar journey to the\r\nUnited States with instructions from the late King\r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia,\r\nto participate in the establishment of this Organization,\r\nwhich arose out of tragic events.\r\nAt the time, my country had just emerged from its\r\nown experience in establishing the foundations of peace\r\nand security over most of the Arabian Peninsula. After\r\nKing Abdulaziz had succeeded in reunifying the Kingdom\r\nin accordance with the noble Islamic Shariah, which calls\r\nfor justice, equality and brotherhood among people, he\r\nparticipated in the establishment of an international\r\nOrganization which strives for the same principles on a\r\nuniversal level.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia represents the heart\r\nof the Muslim world, from whose soil the Islamic faith\r\nemerged; a faith which places peace at the forefront of its\r\nvirtuous principles and rejects violence and terrorism. As\r\na result, King Fahd continues to spare no effort in\r\nenabling the Kingdom to discharge its mission towards\r\npeace.\r\nThe Kingdom has completed an ambitious\r\ndevelopment programme and has made positive\r\ncontributions towards the creation of a better world. A\r\ngood example is my country’s well-balanced oil policy\r\nand its foreign aid programme, which has contributed a\r\ntotal of $70.6 billion over the past two decades to the\r\nbenefit of 72 developing nations.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nMy country continues to believe in the importance of\r\nworking towards realizing the objectives of this\r\nOrganization. The resolutions which the Security Council\r\nadopted after the brutal Iraqi aggression against Kuwait had\r\nthe most positive effect, and renewed confidence in the\r\nimportant role of the United Nations in supporting countries\r\nwhose sovereignty is threatened. Kuwait was able to restore\r\nits right of existence and sovereignty.\r\nI wish to note that the Kingdom attaches great\r\nimportance to the safety and territorial integrity of Iraq.\r\nHowever, it holds the Iraqi regime responsible for the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people and believes that the only way\r\nto alleviate this suffering is for the Iraqi regime to fully\r\nimplement all Security Council resolutions, including the\r\nrelease of all prisoners of war.\r\nInternational cooperation has had a positive impact in\r\nsetting in motion the Middle East peace process, which was\r\nlaunched at the Madrid Conference. While the peace\r\nprocess has not yet achieved its ultimate goal, the\r\nopportunity still remains to move it forward, in particular\r\non the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, provided there is\r\nadherence to its basis, namely, Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) relating to Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and Security\r\nCouncil resolution 252 (1968) regarding al-Quds al-Sharif\r\nwhich occupies a special place in the heart of every\r\nMuslim. In order for the desired peace to be based on trust,\r\nall weapons of mass destruction must be eliminated from\r\nthe entire Middle East region.\r\nThe Serb aggression against the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina requires firmness in confronting it. The\r\naggressor has refused to respond to all international pleas,\r\nwhile the Bosnians are denied the ability to acquire the\r\nmeans of defending themselves. The international response,\r\nunder the leadership of the United States and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), was an appropriate\r\none, even if it was late in coming.\r\nThis tragedy highlights the need for the United\r\nNations not to be a strictly humanitarian organization, but\r\nto resume its role of establishing peace on the basis of\r\njustice and equality. Our Organization should not merely\r\nmanage conflicts, but prevent them. Delays in responding\r\nto events cause the United Nations to waste its resources on\r\nfailures rather than successes, and on death rather than on\r\nlife.\r\nThe capabilities the United Nations has demonstrated\r\nover the past 50 years and the constructive role it has\r\nplayed in mobilizing international cooperation make us\r\ndetermined to support it in discharging its mission,\r\nparticularly today, as it finds itself at a crossroads which\r\nwill determine its future. If the yardstick of the\r\nOrganization’s success lies in its effectiveness in serving\r\nthe cause of international peace and security, we must\r\nunderscore the importance of abiding by its Charter and\r\nenforcing the resolutions of international legality. It is the\r\nhope of The Custodian of The Two Holy Mosques that\r\nour celebration today will make a watershed in the history\r\nof our Organization that will make it possible for the\r\nUnited Nations to achieve its goals and make it possible\r\nfor all peoples of the world to live in security and to\r\nachieve continued progress.\r\nMay God Almighty help us attain the objectives we\r\nstrive for. As the Almighty reveals in the Holy Quran:\r\n“Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but\r\nhelp ye not one another in sin and rancour”. (Susa\r\nV., verse II)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI thank His Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz\r\nAl Saud, Second Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of\r\nDefence and Aviation and Inspector General of Saudi\r\nArabia, for his statement.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al\r\nSaud, Second Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of\r\nDefence and Aviation and Inspector General of\r\nSaudi Arabia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Abdulla bin Khalifa\r\nAl Thani, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of\r\nInterior of Qatar\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on His Highness Sheikh Abdulla bin Khalifa\r\nAl Thani, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior\r\nof Qatar.\r\nSheikh Abdulla bin Khalifa Al Thani\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): I should like to express our\r\njoy at this major celebration, the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations. This body is the source of all the\r\nhopes for a stable world of peace and well-being for\r\nmankind. Qatar hopes that this anniversary will provide\r\nus with the opportunity for new departures towards the\r\nestablishment of a new world that would strengthen the\r\ntrust of peoples in the norms of civilized living and that\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nwould see the achievement of people’s expectations for\r\neconomic and social development and human dignity.\r\nWe ardently hope to see the birth of a new United\r\nNations, which can firmly and effectively face up to the\r\nchallenges of wars, internal conflicts, ethnic intolerance and\r\nother hurdles which hold back mankind’s progress. This can\r\nhappen only if the Organization can do more than set up\r\nmachinery to deal with conflicts after they erupt. Preventive\r\nmeasures should be taken to forestall such conflagrations\r\nthrough the development of societies, economically and\r\nsocially and combating poverty, sickness and all the other\r\ncauses of underdevelopment.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to achieve this, it must\r\nincrease the effectiveness of its machineries: its councils,\r\norgans and specialized bodies, especially the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. Membership\r\nof the Security Council should be expanded, the opportunity\r\nto participate in the decision-making process should be\r\nimproved, the Organization’s role in the economic and\r\nsocial fields should be reactivated and the shortcomings in\r\nthe performance of its specialized agencies in these two\r\nareas should be rectified. This should be done in the\r\ninterests of the Organization’s goals which would lead to\r\nthe prevalence of justice in the world and make it possible\r\nfor all peoples to ensure for their future generations a future\r\nof peace, security and prosperity.\r\nThe question of the Middle East and the establishment\r\nof peace and justice in that region have been the focus of\r\nconsiderable efforts by the United Nations since its\r\nestablishment. Today we can see some of the results of\r\nthose laudable efforts.\r\nThe present peace process will, we hope, achieve the\r\ndesired goal of finding a just, comprehensive and lasting\r\nsettlement in the Middle East.\r\nThe State of Qatar, which appreciates the\r\nachievements of the United Nations, reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to supporting this international Organization in\r\norder for it to achieve its noble goals and realize the\r\naspirations of mankind. Given its belief in the mission of\r\nthe United Nations and its awareness of the Organization’s\r\npositive role in working for the emergence of a new world\r\nthat would be founded on the purposes of the Charter and\r\non commitment to its principles, especially those relating to\r\nthe sovereignty of States, their territorial integrity and non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs as well as to the\r\nsettlement of disputes, by peaceful means, the State of\r\nQatar will continue, within the limits of the resources\r\navailable to it, to contribute to supporting the United\r\nNations activities so that it may achieve its goals and\r\nrealize the hopes attached to it.\r\nOn this solemn occasion, we look forward to a new\r\nUnited Nations that would be capable of translating into\r\nconcrete reality the goals it was established to achieve\r\nand that would, thereby, earn the confidence of all the\r\nworld’s peoples; a new United Nations that would\r\ncontribute effectively to the making of a future of security\r\nand development for all men.\r\nOn behalf of the Emir, Government and people of\r\nthe State of Qatar, we pay tribute to the United Nations\r\non its fiftieth anniversary and call upon the\r\nrepresentatives of the conscience of the world’s peoples\r\nto support it, to abide by its decisions and to adhere to its\r\nprinciples so that it may become the true voice of all\r\npeoples that gives tongue to their true will and to their\r\naspirations after a better future.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of\r\nInterior of Qatar for his statement.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Abdulla bin Khalifa Al Thani,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior of\r\nQatar, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Bethuel\r\nPakalitha Mosisili, Deputy Prime Minister of Lesotho.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on His Excellency The Honourable Bethuel\r\nPakalitha Mosisili, Deputy Prime Minister of Lesotho.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Bethuel Pakalitha\r\nMosisili, Deputy Prime Minister of Lesotho was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Mosisili: We are gathered here to commemorate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and to\r\nreaffirm the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and our commitment to them, particularly\r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States,\r\nterritorial integrity and non-interference in the domestic\r\njurisdiction of States, the peaceful settlement of disputes\r\nand the avoidance of the threat or use of force in inter-\r\nState relations.\r\nThe end of the cold war raised hopes for a better\r\nworld free of war, bloodshed, privation, famine and\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\npestilence. We in Lesotho understand the bitter\r\nconsequences of war and other war-like conflicts. Hence\r\nour unswerving commitment to peace. As the founder of\r\nour nation, King Moshoeshoe I, put it:\r\n“Peace is like rain which makes the grass grow,\r\nWhile war is like the wind which dries it up.”\r\nBecause the absence of rain is a constant menace to our\r\nsurvival as a nation, we consider rain as being on a par\r\nwith peace. This explains our founding father’s metaphor.\r\nWe therefore call on all nations to renounce war and to ban\r\nall nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\r\nAs we celebrate this historic occasion, we cannot but\r\nrejoice in the accomplishments of the United Nations in\r\nbringing the nations of the world together. Internal and\r\ninternational conflicts are, however, not over and we need,\r\ntherefore, to reflect on their causes. Most, if not all, are a\r\nresult of socio-economic deprivation, political and religious\r\nintolerance, oppression, ethnic cleansing, foreign\r\noccupation, genocide, xenophobia and colonial domination.\r\nAll these are inimical to the United Nations principles and\r\npurposes, and our common resolve, therefore, should be to\r\nwork together to build a world devoid of them.\r\nIt is in this connection that Lesotho is proud of its\r\nmodest contribution to one of the ideals of the United\r\nNations, namely, tolerance among peoples. During the dark\r\ndays of apartheid we shared our modest resources with\r\nrefugees from neighbouring South Africa without making\r\nthem feel that they were outsiders. We pay tribute to the\r\nUnited Nations not only for its role in hastening the demise\r\nof apartheid, but also for material assistance to the refugees.\r\nWe continue to place great store in the United Nations\r\nprogramme in the field of human rights. As Lesotho has\r\nsteadily proceeded to construct a democratic governance, it\r\nhas adhered to instruments safeguarding fundamental\r\nfreedoms and human rights, such as the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination\r\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\r\nThe three pillars of the United Nations agenda in the\r\nnext 50 years are peace, human rights and the betterment of\r\nhumankind’s economic and social condition. The\r\nOrganization’s capacity to satisfy our aspirations in those\r\nfields must be especially enhanced and its institutional\r\nreform accelerated.\r\nIn our view, such reform is critical in the three areas\r\nto which I have just referred. The Security Council needs\r\nto be enlarged so as to reflect current political realities, in\r\nwhich the countries of the South are a preponderant\r\nmajority of the United Nations. The Council’s decision-\r\nmaking, which has been monopolized by a handful of\r\nMember States for half a century, is no longer in\r\nconsonance with the present-day drive for democracy\r\nwithin and among States.\r\nSimilarly, the organs dealing with social,\r\nenvironmental and economic matters, notably the\r\nEconomic and Social Council,must be restructured to\r\nenable them to better deliver on the Organization’s\r\ncommitment to meeting the challenges facing the\r\nunderprivileged members of our international community.\r\nFinally, the Secretariat must be equipped to respond\r\neffectively to the myriad problems needing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s attention. Topping the list of requirements, in\r\nthis connection, is the provision of adequate financial and\r\nhuman resources to the Secretariat.\r\nWe ought to be proud that up to now we have,\r\nthrough collective action, warded off a calamity such as\r\nwas the Second World War. It seems that a similar\r\ncalamity may not recur. However, the economic, social\r\nand environmental future of the majority of humankind\r\nstill remains bleak. Let us therefore rededicate ourselves\r\nonce more to making the United Nations a veritable\r\nembodiment of humankind’s hopes and aspirations for a\r\nbetter world for all.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI thank the Deputy Prime Minister of Lesotho for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Bethuel Pakalitha\r\nMosisili, Deputy Prime Minister of Lesotho, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Omar Mustafa\r\nMuntasser, Secretary of the General People’s\r\nCommittee for Foreign Liaison and International\r\nCooperation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Omar Mustafa\r\nMuntasser, Secretary of the General People’s Committee\r\nfor Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation of the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Omar Mustafa Muntasser,\r\nSecretary of the General People’s Committee for\r\nForeign Liaison and International Cooperation of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Muntasser (interpretation from Arabic): In the\r\ncourse of the fifty years that have elapsed since its\r\nestablishment, the United Nations has sought to strengthen\r\nthe procedures that guarantee the security and safety of\r\npeoples, ensure their obtention of their rights, promote their\r\ndevelopment and accelerate their advancement. But the\r\nOrganization’s success in achieving these goals has been\r\nmodest.\r\nEven in the post-cold war era, which had given rise to\r\nmany expectations, the record shows that developments in\r\nthe international arena have shown that those expectations\r\nwere too optimistic. The factors that impeded economic\r\nprogress in many countries of the world have not been\r\nradically dealt with. Unemployment rates have continued to\r\nrise. Social disintegration has increased, the vertical\r\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons has continued and civil\r\nwars and regional conflicts have broken out in most regions\r\nin a manner that has given the impression that the globe we\r\nlive on has suddenly exploded.\r\nFailure by the United Nations is not due to any defect\r\nin its Charter. It is due to the absence of political will in\r\nthe case of a number of major Powers that want for the\r\nOrganization either to become impotent and incapable of\r\nperforming its tasks by withholding the funds it needs, or\r\nto surrender to the pressures of those Powers and to execute\r\ntheir designs. Regrettably, those few States have succeeded\r\nin achieving their objectives. The General Assembly, which\r\nshould be the highest authority in the United Nations\r\nsystem, has had its role marginalized in such a way that it\r\nhas become a sort of wailing wall where the small and poor\r\ncountries shed their tears, exchange their woes while\r\nnobody listens and nobody cares. Most powers have been\r\nconcentrated in the Security Council which has turned into\r\na sort of exclusive club whose activities are governed by\r\nselfish interests and where double standards are the order\r\nof the day. In its actions, the Council no longer observes\r\nthe rule of law but has turned into a body governed by\r\ncustomary law. This has enabled a few of its members to\r\nimpose their policies, get their designs adopted and use the\r\nCouncil as a tool to impose sanctions on countries,\r\nespecially small ones, in an attempt at subjugating them.\r\nWorse still, the Security Council, which is the body\r\nentrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international\r\npeace and security, has become an instrument of aggression.\r\nThis situation is untenable and impossible to coexist\r\nwith. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the actions of the\r\nOrganization and to seek to enhance its role in promoting\r\ndevelopment, correcting the imbalance in the world\r\neconomy with its many trade barriers and coercive\r\nmeasures, and guaranteeing the settlement of disputes\r\nbetween States by peaceful means, and not by the\r\nimposition of unjust sanctions. The United Nations\r\ncapabilities should be strengthened in the areas of\r\ncombating desertification, removing minefields, halting\r\nthe deterioration of the environment, solving the host of\r\nproblems that beset the world, such as poverty, hunger,\r\ndrugs and organized crime, as well as epidemic and\r\nendemic diseases. The Organization should be enabled\r\nalso to intensify efforts to eradicate the phenomenon of\r\ninternational terrorism in all its forms. Libya has sought\r\nand still seeks to combat terrorism and has called for the\r\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly\r\nfor the study of the phenomenon of terrorism, including\r\nState terrorism. That is why it is unfair to accuse my\r\ncountry of terrorism as the American President did\r\nyesterday. The fact is that terrorism is, in essence, an\r\nAmerican phenomenon. The United States has habitually\r\nused it against most peoples and States, including Libya,\r\nwhich has been the target of several American\r\nconspiracies aimed at overthrowing its revolutionary\r\nregime. When it failed to do so, the United States\r\nimposed on Libya its coercive measures and targeted it\r\nwith many provocations by its Mediterranean fleets.\r\nAmerican terrorism reached its peak when hundreds of\r\nAmerican military aircraft, under the cover of darkness,\r\nraided and bombed Libya’s cities, demolished houses, and\r\nleft behind tens of innocent civilian casualties, including\r\nwomen and children. Lastly, the United States used the\r\nSecurity Council to impose unjust sanctions against Libya,\r\nunder the pretext of a legal dispute already dealt with in\r\nthe 1971 Montreal Convention for the Suppression of\r\nUnlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation.\r\nThese sanctions have resulted in the death and injury of\r\nthousands of Libyan nationals in road accidents because\r\nof the intensive use of roads. In addition, the economic\r\nlosses have exceeded tens of billions of dollars.\r\nFor these and other reasons, it has become essential\r\nto reform the United Nations so that it may carry out its\r\ntasks in accordance with the wishes of all its Member\r\nStates and not as a sword that hangs over their necks,\r\nespecially the necks of the small ones among them. This\r\nrequires the independence of the Organization in\r\npreparing its agendas and in adopting its resolutions. In\r\nthis context, the role of the General Assembly in the field\r\nof maintaining international peace and security must be\r\nenhanced especially when the posture of the Security\r\nCouncil becomes harmful to international peace. The\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\npowers of this General Assembly must be extended to\r\ninclude following up and monitoring other bodies specially\r\nthe Security Council which should be held accountable to\r\nit: the General Assembly should look into the Council’s\r\nresolutions to see to what extent they are consistent with\r\nthe Charter and with the aims and purposes of the United\r\nNations. Membership of the Security Council should be\r\nincreased and should reflect an equitable geographic\r\ndistribution. The Council’s working methods should be\r\nimproved to guarantee that it should not apply double\r\nstandards in dealing with international issues. Also,\r\nparticipation in the decision-making processes of the\r\nCouncil should be expanded. The Council’s tendency to\r\nfollow the wishes of certain members in its interpretations\r\nof the Charter, especially Article 39 thereof, should be\r\nhalted. The Council should perform in accordance with the\r\nwishes of all Member States. It is now high time to repeal\r\nthe veto power because it is inconsistent with the principle\r\nof sovereign equality and has been used to prevent the\r\ncondemnation of acts of aggression and punishment of the\r\naggressor. The veto power has been used several times\r\nagainst the exercise of the right to self-determination by\r\npeoples that still languish under the yoke of colonialism.\r\nAbove all this, it is no longer acceptable that such a\r\nprivilege should be enjoyed by States which still colonize\r\nother countries and which seek to perpetuate their\r\nhegemony over the fate of the world and to monopolize the\r\npower of making international decisions.\r\nThis is our view of the march of the United\r\nNations — our assessment of its role and our vision of\r\nwhat it should be in order for it to be able to perform its\r\ntasks. We hope that this occasion will be a starting-point\r\nfor an unshackled United Nations that would continue to be\r\nrevitalized and committed to the service of all peoples and\r\nnot just a few States that seek to use it as a means to\r\nachieve their own ends. These few should realize that the\r\nUnited Nations has not been freed from the shackles of the\r\ncold war to find itself shackled by the fetters of major\r\nPowers. Should these States insist on making the United\r\nNations deviate from its goals, and on exploiting it in\r\nimposing their domination on small and poor countries,\r\nthey should not forget that it is the small countries that\r\nhave helped the United Nations increase its membership\r\nand attain universality. Those small countries are quite\r\ncapable of establishing their own organization away from\r\nthe domination and hegemony of a few major Powers.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFor people to reflect on, in Macbeth it says:\r\n“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,\r\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\r\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\r\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\nThe way to dusty death.”\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nI have conveyed the message to you all.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI thank the Secretary of the General People’s Committee\r\nfor Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation of the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Omar Mustafa Muntasser,\r\nSecretary of the General People’s Committee for\r\nForeign Liaison and International Cooperation of\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Destin Arsène Tsaty-\r\nBoungou, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation\r\nand Francophonie of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Destin Arsène Tsaty-\r\nBoungou, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and\r\nFrancophonie of the Congo.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Destin Arsène Tsaty-Boungou,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and\r\nFrancophonie of the Congo, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Tsaty-Boungou (interpretation from French):\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, allow me to add the Congo’s voice to the\r\nunanimous tribute paid here to the illustrious founding\r\nfathers and the important work carried out by the United\r\nNations in decolonization, the promotion of human rights\r\nand the codification of international law.\r\nThis fiftieth anniversary comes at a time when a\r\nblack page in the history of mankind, the page of the cold\r\nwar, has been turned. But the world continues to face\r\nother challenges. Indeed, the widespread desire to bring\r\nuniformity to international society in political and\r\ninstitutional terms, on the one hand, and economic and\r\nsocial terms, on the other, has led to an imbalance every\r\nbit as dramatic as the imbalance not so long ago when the\r\nworld was bipolar.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nEast-West confrontation has been succeeded by\r\nanother “cold war”, even more injurious to the peoples of\r\nthe South, especially those in Africa who daily fall prey to\r\nhunger, ignorance and disease.\r\nYet this fiftieth anniversary might have been an\r\noccasion to pay tribute to the progress accomplished by\r\nAfrica in the past 50 years thanks to the solidarity of the\r\ninternational community. This fiftieth anniversary might\r\nalso have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50\r\nyears ago were poor and dominated, especially those on the\r\nAfrican continent, now find themselves today among the\r\nprosperous nations of our planet, a natural position, given\r\ntheir boundless natural resources.\r\nUnfortunately, on this fiftieth anniversary we are\r\nobliged to note that the same nations that were powerful 50\r\nyears ago are even more powerful today thanks to their\r\ncommand of science and technology. The expectations of\r\nthe African peoples, who, like the other peoples of the\r\nplanet, contributed to the liberation of mankind in the two\r\nmajor armed world confrontations that preceded the birth of\r\nthe United Nations, have not been fulfilled by a fitting\r\ndisplay of solidarity on the part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nToday, the end of the ideological war does offer\r\nprospects for African development thanks to the\r\ndemocratization of our countries’ institutions. Yet for many\r\nAfrican countries, the end of the single-party system that\r\nsubjected their populations to so many misfortunes and\r\nconflicts has not created the conditions for a peaceful and\r\nprosperous life — far from it. Longstanding and long-\r\nrepressed political resentments have turned into civil and\r\neven ethnic wars, compromising any chance of creating the\r\nconditions favourable to investment and development.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe United Nations and the international community\r\nas a whole cannot remain indifferent to our peoples’ desire\r\nto gain greater freedom, greater justice, and greater social\r\nwell-being, as well as — and above all — to accede to the\r\nmost relevant and greatest power of mankind —\r\nknowledge.\r\nAfrica can then be at the rendezvous of the history of\r\nnations certain that the principles of solidarity, equality and\r\njustice proclaimed in this Assembly as virtues sacred and\r\ncardinal to man’s life and prosperity will indeed be the\r\nactive ingredients of cooperation between North and South.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Cooperation and Francophonie of the Congo for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Destin Arsène Tsaty-Boungou,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and\r\nFrancophonie of the Congo, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Chief Tom Ikimi, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Nigeria\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Chief\r\nTom Ikimi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria.\r\nHis Excellency Chief Tom Ikimi, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Nigeria, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nChief Ikimi: Mr. President, on behalf of my Head\r\nof State, General Sani Abacha, and the Government and\r\npeople of Nigeria, I convey to you warm greetings as we\r\nobserve in a Special Commemorative Meeting the high\r\npoint of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the view of my Government, it is legitimate and\r\npurposeful that we transcend the euphoria of the occasion\r\nto take a hard look at the very purposes and principles\r\nwhich informed the founding of our Organization. As we\r\ndo so, it is important that we have the courage to admit\r\nour failures and record successes.\r\nThirty-five years ago Nigeria was admitted as the\r\nninety-ninth Member of the Organization. On that\r\noccasion our first Prime Minister, Alhaji Sir Abubakar\r\nTafawa Balewa, articulated our nation’s foreign-policy\r\nprinciples and underlined our commitment to the United\r\nNations. He said, inter alia:\r\n“First, it is the desire of Nigeria ... to remain\r\non friendly terms with all nations and to participate\r\nactively in the work of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, Nigeria, a large and populous country ...\r\nhas absolutely no territorial or expansionist\r\nintentions. Thirdly, we shall not forget our old\r\nfriends, and we are proud to have been accepted as\r\na member of the ... Commonwealth. But,\r\nnevertheless, we do not intend to ally ourselves as a\r\nmatter of routine with any of the Power blocs. We\r\nare committed to uphold the principles upon which\r\nthe United Nations is founded. Fourthly, Nigeria\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nhopes to work with other African States for the\r\nprogress of Africa and to assist in bringing all African\r\nterritories to a state of responsible independence.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifteenth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 893rd meeting, para. 173)\r\nToday, I stand before the Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting on the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization to\r\nreaffirm these principles of our foreign policy as well as\r\nNigeria’s commitment to the purposes and principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter. All Member States have the duty,\r\nunder the Charter of the Organization, to respect the rights\r\nof all nations, big or small, and to refrain from the threat or\r\nuse of force and pressure capable of subverting the\r\nsovereignty and independence of other States.\r\nThe theme of war and peace has confronted the United\r\nNations since its inception. Indeed, the founding fathers of\r\nthe world body expressed their determination\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar, which...has brought untold sorrow to mankind”.\r\nRegrettably, these wars are proliferating mostly in the\r\ndeveloping countries and have resulted in mindless human\r\nand material waste, destruction and dislocation of social\r\nstructures, tidal waves of refugees and displacement of\r\npopulations.\r\nA major instrument for preserving international peace\r\nand security has been United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. These operations require huge financial, human\r\nand material resources. Nigeria has made important\r\ncontributions to international peace-keeping efforts. We\r\nbelieve that United Nations peace-keeping operations have\r\nlargely succeeded in mitigating suffering, staving off hunger\r\nand starvation and helping to resolve conflict. Nonetheless,\r\nthe underlying causes of many conflicts are mainly social\r\nand economic. Therefore, the United Nations must strike a\r\nbalance between the resources devoted to peace-keeping\r\noperations and those made available for economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDevelopment is a question of the human condition,\r\nand for many countries it is indeed a question of survival.\r\nHence, the Agenda for Development must present a fitting\r\ncomplement to “An Agenda for Peace”. When we address\r\nthe issues of development, there must be a renewed sense\r\nof cooperation and partnership between the developed and\r\nthe developing countries. The benefits of the recent growth\r\nin the world economy should also be more evenly\r\ndistributed among all countries. Countries of the South\r\nshould not remain trapped in poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity\r\nprices, unfavourable trade practices, dwindling resource\r\ninflows, restrictions in the transfer of technology,\r\nunpredictable global monetary and financial systems and\r\nexternal debt burden.\r\nWe in Africa recognize that our socio-economic\r\ndestinies lie in our hands. Nonetheless, the peculiar and\r\nunsatisfactory economic situation of the continent needs\r\nto be addressed as a shared responsibility. Therefore, the\r\ninternational community needs urgently to deliver on its\r\ncommitment to Africa and fully implement the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s.\r\nWe in Nigeria are grateful for the interest shown by\r\nthe international community in the evolution of our\r\npolitical and economic experiences, but we wish to recall\r\nthat the destiny of Nigeria must remain in the hands of\r\nthe people of our country. In this regard my\r\nAdministration has taken enormous steps to restructure\r\nand revitalize our country’s economy through deregulation\r\nand creation of incentives for investment.\r\nOur programme of transition to democratic rule\r\nseeks to widen the base of governance and ensure the\r\nparticipation of all sections of the country. It proceeds\r\nfrom the premise that our sovereignty is inviolate and our\r\nnation indivisible. In our view, sustainable democracy can\r\nbe achieved only if it draws sustenance from the socio-\r\neconomic conditions of a people or derives from their\r\npolitical experience.\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to observe that from\r\ndecolonization to peace operations, from the promotion of\r\npeace and security to the pursuit of development, the\r\nmanagement of the environment and the promotion of\r\nhuman rights, the record of performance of the\r\nOrganization has been impressive. There have also been\r\ndisconcerting failures. Hence we believe that the\r\nOrganization needs urgently to reform itself and\r\ndemocratize its major organs, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil and related institutions and agencies, to ensure\r\nrepresentativeness, equitable geographical distribution,\r\ntransparency and effectiveness.\r\nIn this regard Nigeria reaffirms the position of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity that our continent should\r\nhave two permanent members in an enlarged and\r\nreformed Security Council.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nFinally, the United Nations must redefine its capacity\r\nand role as well as shift its focus away from crisis\r\nmanagement to the pursuit of development and the primacy\r\nof international law. To this end the international\r\ncommunity can always count on Nigeria’s contribution and\r\nsupport.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nigeria for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Chief Tom Ikimi, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nigeria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Ben Micah,\r\nM.P., Special Envoy of the Prime Minister of Papua\r\nNew Guinea\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Ben Micah, Special Envoy of the Prime\r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Ben Micah, M.P.,\r\nSpecial Envoy of the Prime Minister of Papua New\r\nGuinea, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Micah: It is my honour and pleasure to address\r\nthis Special Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations on behalf of the people and Government of Papua\r\nNew Guinea.\r\nFirst allow me to offer my warmest congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations.\r\nEmerging from the scourge of the Second World War\r\nand the devastation inflicted by the nuclear holocaust, the\r\nfounding fathers of the United Nations designed this unique\r\nmultilateral Organization destined to foster international\r\nharmony, promote development, and ensure world peace\r\nand security. Much has been achieved in this first half-\r\ncentury of the work of the United Nations. However,\r\ngreater challenges still lie ahead. The United Nations no\r\ndoubt remains the only global entity capable of shaping\r\ninternational consensus in order to instil confidence and\r\nfacilitate international development cooperation. Papua New\r\nGuinea stands to salute the achievements of the United\r\nNations and will continue to support the noble cause and\r\nobjectives of the Organization.\r\nThe end of the cold war provides a rare opportunity\r\nto the international community to divert its energies and\r\nresources towards positive development directed at\r\nmeeting the basic needs of our peoples and thereby\r\nensuring long-term peace and stability.\r\nWe have reached consensus on a number of\r\nimportant points at the international level, with the focus\r\non social and economic issues, thus giving further\r\nimpetus to international confidence-building. However,\r\nthe full realization of the programmes of action has not\r\nyet been achieved. It will require dedication, commitment\r\nand, above all, political will and moral courage to commit\r\nthe necessary resources for the effective implementation\r\nof the programmes adopted.\r\nThe forces of economic globalization have\r\nprofoundly changed the geopolitical landscape, creating\r\nnew opportunities as well as new challenges. While global\r\neconomic integration has its positive aspect, it does not\r\nhowever promote homogenous development. The\r\nweakness of the international monetary system and\r\nunequal trading practices severely retard the economic\r\ngrowth of developing nations and further add to the\r\ndifficulties of achieving competitiveness and access to\r\nmarkets in industrialized countries. Efforts to establish\r\nappropriate mechanisms to assist developing countries are\r\nconcomitant with the issues of job creation, improving\r\nfamily income, and attaining social progress.\r\nEnvironmental issues have become an all-\r\nencompassing international agenda. Within the context of\r\nan interdependent world we have collective responsibility,\r\nguided by the framework of international conventions, to\r\nmanage and develop resources in a manner conducive to\r\nachieving long-term sustainability.\r\nThrough effective international and regional\r\ncooperation we will be able to meet our obligations as\r\ncustodians of our biological resources by pursuing\r\npolicies and strategies that would facilitate sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt this crucial juncture in human history we are\r\ncompelled by social and economic imperatives,\r\ncharacterized by growing poverty and marginalization of\r\nthe powerless and the weak, to choose a course of action\r\nthat will empower the citizens of the world to develop\r\ntheir full potential in order to enable them to secure their\r\nbasic needs and improve their livelihood.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nThe commitment of resources at both the national and\r\ninternational levels ought to be focused on the development\r\nof programmes that place priority on the development of\r\nhuman capacities, and removing institutional and\r\ninfrastructural impediments in order to facilitate sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nGiven the current international climate, my country\r\nstrongly deplores the actions of some nuclear-weapon States\r\nin continuing their nuclear-weapon testing, acting contrary\r\nto the spirit and objectives of the recently extended Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nThe oceans of the South Pacific hold one of\r\nmankind’s unique resources of biological wealth.\r\nContinuous nuclear testing within this very sensitive and\r\nenvironmentally vulnerable region not only directly\r\nthreatens our common heritage but also threatens the basic\r\nsurvival of the Pacific island people. The action of these\r\ncountries is a backward step which directly undermines the\r\nconfidence given to the nuclear non-proliferation regime\r\nand hence threatens international peace and security.\r\nWe support the call for the reform of the United\r\nNations to make it more efficient, responsive, and capable\r\nof meeting the multifaceted demands prompted by a rapidly\r\nchanging international environment. We therefore agree that\r\nthe United Nations future destiny lies in the hands of its\r\nMembers.\r\nSuch a process of reform, however, should not be\r\ncompromised by the dictates of the powerful. Consensus on\r\nthe goals and objectives of United Nations reform should\r\nreflect the needs and aspirations of all Member States, and\r\nespecially the particular needs of developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations has a pivotal role to play in\r\nshaping positive visions to guide international relations. The\r\nvalues of democracy, interdependence, tolerance and respect\r\nfor diversity should be upheld in the interests of all\r\nMember States.\r\nFrom this perspective Papua New Guinea supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to define a new paradigm for\r\ndevelopment which emphasizes the empowerment of people\r\nand focuses on the human dimensions of development and\r\non securing the basic needs of people and communities.\r\nSuch a development concept can be pursued effectively\r\nthrough the framework of global governance based on the\r\nprinciples of equity and justice.\r\nThe United Nations must be strengthened to continue\r\nits work to defend the rights of the underprivileged and\r\nthe powerless and to promote universal values that would\r\nembrace diversity and ensure world peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, may I on behalf of my Prime\r\nMinister, The Right Honourable Sir Julius Chan, and the\r\npeople of Papua New Guinea reaffirm our continuing\r\ncommitment and support for the work of the United\r\nNations and assure the Assembly that we will do our\r\nutmost to uphold the principles and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter with God’s help.\r\nThe President: I thank the Special Envoy of the\r\nPrime Minister of Papua New Guinea for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Ben Micah, M.P.,\r\nSpecial Envoy of the Prime Minister of Papua New\r\nGuinea, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of Djibouti\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nRoble Olhaye, Chairman of the Delegation of Djibouti.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye, Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of Djibouti, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Olhaye: His Excellency President Hassan\r\nGouled Aptidon, on behalf of the people of Djibouti, is\r\npleased to extend his warmest greetings to fellow Heads\r\nof State and Government and to all who are gathered here\r\nto celebrate this important milestone, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of our Organization. Recognition must also be\r\ngiven to the untiring leadership of our Secretary-General,\r\nand to the dedicated efforts of the Secretariat of the\r\nUnited Nations whose management of this event has been\r\nso exemplary. Ambassador Butler of Australia and his\r\nCommittee have also to be thanked for so diligently\r\npreserving the significance of this occasion.\r\nOur programme of transition to democratic rule\r\nseeks to widen the base of governance and ensure the\r\nparticipation of all sections of the country. It proceeds\r\nfrom the premise that our sovereignty is inviolate and our\r\nnation indivisible. In our view, sustainable democracy can\r\nbe achieved only if it draws sustenance from the socio-\r\neconomic conditions of a people or derives from their\r\npolitical experience.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to observe that from\r\ndecolonization to peace operations, from the promotion of\r\npeace and security to the pursuit of development, the\r\nmanagement of the environment and the promotion of\r\nhuman rights, the record of performance of the\r\nOrganization has been impressive. There have also been\r\ndisconcerting failures. Hence we believe that the\r\nOrganization needs urgently to reform itself and\r\ndemocratize its major organs, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil and related institutions and agencies, to ensure\r\nrepresentativeness, equitable geographical distribution,\r\ntransparency and effectiveness.\r\nIn this regard Nigeria reaffirms the position of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity that our continent should\r\nhave two permanent members in an enlarged and reformed\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFinally, the United Nations must redefine its capacity\r\nand role as well as shift its focus away from crisis\r\nmanagement to the pursuit of development and the primacy\r\nof international law. To this end the international\r\ncommunity can always count on Nigeria’s contribution and\r\nsupport.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nigeria for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Chief Tom Ikimi, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nigeria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Ben Micah,\r\nSpecial Envoy of the Prime Minister of Papua New\r\nGuinea\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Ben Micah, Special Envoy of the Prime\r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Ben Micah, Special\r\nEnvoy of the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Micah: It is my honour and pleasure to address\r\nthis Special Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations on behalf of the people and Government of Papua\r\nNew Guinea.\r\nFirst allow me to offer my warmest congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations.\r\nEmerging from the scourge of the Second World\r\nWar and the devastation inflicted by the nuclear\r\nholocaust, the founding fathers of the United Nations\r\ndesigned this unique multilateral Organization destined to\r\nfoster international harmony, promote development, and\r\nensure world peace and security. Much has been achieved\r\nin this first half-century of the work of the United\r\nNations. However, greater challenges still lie ahead. The\r\nUnited Nations no doubt remains the only global entity\r\ncapable of shaping international consensus in order to\r\ninstil confidence and facilitate international development\r\ncooperation. Papua New Guinea stands to salute the\r\nachievements of the United Nations and will continue to\r\nsupport the noble cause and objectives of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe end of the cold war provides a rare opportunity\r\nto the international community to divert its energies and\r\nresources towards positive development directed at\r\nmeeting the basic needs of our peoples and thereby\r\nensuring long-term peace and stability.\r\nWe have reached consensus on a number of\r\nimportant points at the international level, with the focus\r\non social and economic issues, thus giving further\r\nimpetus to international confidence-building. However,\r\nthe full realization of the programmes of action has not\r\nyet been achieved. It will require dedication, commitment\r\nand, above all, political will and moral courage to commit\r\nthe necessary resources for the effective implementation\r\nof the programmes adopted.\r\nThe forces of economic globalization have\r\nprofoundly changed the geopolitical landscape, creating\r\nnew opportunities as well as new challenges. While global\r\neconomic integration has its positive aspect, it does not\r\nhowever promote homogenous development. The\r\nweakness of the international monetary system and\r\nunequal trading practices severely retard the economic\r\ngrowth of developing nations and further add to the\r\ndifficulties of achieving competitiveness and access to\r\nmarkets in industrialized countries. Efforts to establish\r\nappropriate mechanisms to assist developing countries are\r\nconcomitant with the issues of job creation, improving\r\nfamily income, and attaining social progress.\r\nEnvironmental issues have become an all-\r\nencompassing international agenda. Within the context of\r\nan interdependent world we have collective responsibility,\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nguided by the framework of international conventions, to\r\nmanage and develop resources in a manner conducive to\r\nachieving long-term sustainability.\r\nThrough effective international and regional\r\ncooperation we will be able to meet our obligations as\r\ncustodians of our biological resources by pursuing policies\r\nand strategies that would facilitate sustainable development.\r\nAt this crucial juncture in human history we are\r\ncompelled by social and economic imperatives,\r\ncharacterized by growing poverty and marginalization of the\r\npowerless and the weak, to choose a course of action that\r\nwill empower the citizens of the world to develop their full\r\npotential in order to enable them to secure their basic needs\r\nand improve their livelihood.\r\nThe commitment of resources at both the national and\r\ninternational levels ought to be focused on the development\r\nof programmes that place priority on the development of\r\nhuman capacities, and removing institutional and\r\ninfrastructural impediments in order to facilitate sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nGiven the current international climate, my country\r\nstrongly deplores the actions of some States with nuclear\r\nweapons in continuing their nuclear-weapon testing, acting\r\ncontrary to the spirit and objectives of the recently extended\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nThe oceans of the South Pacific hold one of\r\nmankind’s unique resources of biological wealth.\r\nContinuous nuclear testing within this very sensitive and\r\nenvironmentally vulnerable region not only directly\r\nthreatens our common heritage but also threatens the basic\r\nsurvival of the Pacific island people. The action of these\r\ncountries is a backward step which directly undermines the\r\nconfidence given to the nuclear non-proliferation regime\r\nand hence threatens international peace and security.\r\nWe support the call for the reform of the United\r\nNations to make it more efficient, responsive, and capable\r\nof meeting the multifaceted demands prompted by a rapidly\r\nchanging international environment. We therefore agree that\r\nthe United Nations future destiny lies in the hands of its\r\nMembers.\r\nSuch a process of reform, however, should not be\r\ncompromised by the dictates of the powerful. Consensus on\r\nthe goals and objectives of United Nations reform should\r\nreflect the needs and aspirations of all Member States, and\r\nespecially the particular needs of developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations has a pivotal role to play in\r\nshaping positive visions to guide international relations.\r\nThe values of democracy, interdependence, tolerance and\r\nrespect for diversity should be upheld in the interests of\r\nall Member States.\r\nFrom this perspective Papua New Guinea supports\r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to define a new paradigm\r\nfor development which emphasizes the empowerment of\r\npeople and focuses on the human dimensions of\r\ndevelopment and on securing the basic needs of people\r\nand communities. Such a development concept can be\r\npursued effectively through the framework of global\r\ngovernance based on the principles of equity and justice.\r\nThe United Nations must be strengthened to continue\r\nits work to defend the rights of the underprivileged and\r\nthe powerless and to promote universal values that would\r\nembrace diversity and ensure world peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, may I on behalf of my Prime\r\nMinister, The Right Honourable Sir Julius Chan, and the\r\npeople of Papua New Guinea reaffirm our continuing\r\ncommitment and support for the work of the United\r\nNations and assure the Assembly that we will do our\r\nutmost to uphold the principles and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter with God’s help.\r\nThe President: I thank the Special Envoy of the\r\nPrime Minister of Papua New Guinea for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Ben Micah, Special\r\nEnvoy of the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of Djibouti\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nRoble Olhaye, Chairman of the Delegation of Djibouti.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye, Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of Djibouti, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Olhaye: His Excellency President Hassan\r\nGouled Aptidon, on behalf of the people of Djibouti, is\r\npleased to extend his warmest greetings to fellow Heads\r\nof State and Government and to all who are gathered here\r\nto celebrate this important milestone, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of our Organization. Recognition must also be\r\ngiven to the untiring leadership of our Secretary-General,\r\nand to the dedicated efforts of the Secretariat of the\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nUnited Nations whose management of this event has been\r\nso exemplary. Ambassador Butler of Australia and his\r\nCommittee have also to be thanked for so diligently\r\npreserving the significance of this occasion.\r\nThe last 50 years have been momentous ones for\r\nmankind. During that time the United Nations has in large\r\npart managed to maintain a significant level of international\r\ncooperation. This is an achievement worthy of recognition\r\nand appreciation. True, the United Nations and its\r\npredecessor, the League of Nations, were erected by the\r\nvictors in the aftermath of global wars, essentially to\r\nprevent a repetition of similar catastrophes. But at its\r\nformation in San Francisco in 1945, the United Nations was\r\nseen as more than an instrument of collective security. It\r\nwas to embody the collective hopes and aspirations of\r\nmankind and to serve as a forum of final resort for States\r\nin the throes of an uncertain post-war period. The early\r\npost-war period also witnessed the realization of a need to\r\nprotect not simply nation-States, but the rights of the\r\nindividual as well, as enshrined in the historic Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights in 1948.\r\nThe demise of the cold war, with its rigid control over\r\npolitical change both within and between States, has\r\nunleashed a period of considerable ethnic and political\r\nconflict within States. Designated almost by default to settle\r\nthese issues, the United Nations has seen its traditional\r\npeace-keeping role stretched beyond its limits, having\r\nlacked the capacity, experience or resources to cope with\r\nthese new phenomena. Mandates for peace-keeping have\r\noften been too weak, inarticulate or deliberately confused,\r\neven as the relatively mundane activity of peace-keeping\r\nrapidly became a key instrument of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nBut the persistence of conflict, particularly in Bosnia\r\nand Somalia, has sapped the political will of the United\r\nNations to stay the course. Without a doubt, the atrocities\r\nand mayhem inflicted on a whole segment of the population\r\nin Rwanda will always haunt the United Nations. Ironically,\r\nwe have returned to that somewhat indecisive, almost\r\nineffective, posture of the cold-war era, and this is a\r\nsituation of concern to many who look to the collective-\r\nsecurity promise of the United Nations Charter for survival.\r\nWill mankind’s future now be one filled with more Bosnias\r\nand Somalias, one of dangerous and unresolved conflicts,\r\none where the United Nations shies away from disarming\r\nbelligerents or protecting innocent civilians because of a\r\nlack of the right mandates, adequate resources and, of\r\ncourse, political will on the part of the international\r\ncommunity?\r\nFor us in the Horn of Africa, long plagued by\r\nnatural disasters and the residual effects of the cold war,\r\nthere is a recovery in sight at long last. But the tragedy of\r\nSomalia cannot simply be abandoned. It cannot wither\r\naway, or even slowly die, and with it the whole region\r\nsuffers. It is unfathomable that a country that has been a\r\nMember of this Organization since 1960 is sadly and\r\nconspicuously absent today. Let us ponder this anomaly\r\nas we continue to commemorate this fiftieth anniversary.\r\nOur world is moving on, evolving in ways barely\r\nperceptible 50 years ago. Colonial empires have been\r\ndismantled, the cold war has ended, and mankind has\r\nstruck out in search of new identities and structures.\r\nRapid technological, economic and political changes have\r\ncomplicated the ability of States to control their own\r\ndirection, while some have fallen considerably behind in\r\nthe race for development. The inevitable uncertainties\r\nhave provided opportunities for many unscrupulous\r\ngroups to fan the flames of discontent in a rush to power.\r\nOnce again we have come to realize there is seldom\r\npeace without development; democracy is simply another\r\nname for peace with development.\r\nThe sheer breadth of change and people-focused\r\ndevelopment have created new social realities, as well as\r\ndemands from people never heard before. The United\r\nNations thematic global conferences of the 1990s have\r\ngiven a significant voice to many of these suppressed\r\ngroups and issues and have woven a common thread of\r\nconcern to improve the lot of the world’s majority.\r\nHidden problems of health, education, poverty,\r\nenvironment, women and human and social rights are\r\nnow glaringly public and unavoidable and call for new\r\napproaches to international cooperation and governance.\r\nCertainly, the physical life of the individual has\r\nimproved during the past half century. The spread of\r\ndisease is much better controlled, and standards are now\r\nhigher. Even in Africa, the last of the world’s continents\r\nto take off economically, life expectancy climbed by 25\r\nper cent between 1960 and 1992, and adult literacy\r\ndoubled, to 54 per cent, in the last two decades.\r\nWhile we are far from being a totally healthy and\r\nsocially productive world, at least the possibility is\r\nirrefutable.\r\nFifty years ago, a mere 51 States began the United\r\nNations. Today, with “nation inflation”, we are 185\r\nMembers. In a world so different in so many ways, few\r\nwould argue that the United Nations must be reformed if\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nit is to remain relevant to the essential hope and vision of\r\nits founders for a better world. But it needs stable\r\nresources, reordered priorities and more relevant and\r\nrepresentative structures. Reform which addresses both\r\nglobal developments and the structural inadequacies of the\r\nUnited Nations must be given priority, or the Organization\r\nmay soon become incapable of addressing the real global\r\nproblems of disease, hunger, poverty, development, conflict,\r\nsecurity and national breakdown, which can only lead to\r\ncontinued international chaos and decline.\r\nAs a small nation, Djibouti is a firm believer in the\r\nUnited Nations system. The United Nations is the most\r\nimportant vehicle we have today to enable us to forge a\r\nnew international system anchored in justice and equity. Its\r\nsurvival is crucial to our well-being. Let us renew our\r\ndedication to keep this superb vessel afloat, for the\r\nconsequences of not doing so would be tragic.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the delegation\r\nof Djibouti for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye, Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of Djibouti, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Annette des Iles,\r\nChairperson of the Delegation of Trinidad and Tobago\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency Mrs.\r\nAnnette des Iles, Chairperson of the Delegation of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Annette des Iles, Chairperson of\r\nthe Delegation of Trinidad and Tobago, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nMrs. des Iles: I bring to the General Assembly, on the\r\noccasion of this golden-jubilee Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting, the greetings and good wishes of the Government\r\nand the people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nFifty years ago, in the aftermath of the Second World\r\nWar, the international community, “determined to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war”, resolved\r\nat San Francisco to create an Organization that would\r\nestablish the political, economic and social conditions for\r\na new and lasting peace. This resolve remains as relevant\r\nand valid in 1995 as it was in 1945.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago joined the United Nations in\r\n1962, 17 years after this Organization had been founded.\r\nAs a small, developing State we saw in the principle of\r\ncollective security enshrined in the Charter a bastion for\r\nsmall States, whose sovereignty and strength must be\r\nsustained by the rule of law. Today, as in 1962, we\r\nreaffirm our deep commitment to the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter.\r\nFor Trinidad and Tobago, as for the great majority\r\nof the Member States which make up this Organization,\r\nour first responsibility is to our people: to provide an\r\nacceptable standard of living and an improved quality of\r\nlife for all our citizens, including our young people and\r\nour women. It follows that in countries such as ours, this\r\nOrganization will be judged largely by the extent to\r\nwhich it can assist in this effort. We wish to urge,\r\ntherefore, that international cooperation for development\r\nbe placed at the centre of the activities of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs we mark the fiftieth anniversary year of our\r\nOrganization, the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies can be justifiably proud of many of their\r\nachievements, in the fields of decolonization, the\r\neradication of apartheid, the promotion of democracy and\r\nhuman rights and the development of international law\r\nand the inestimable and often unheralded work done in\r\nsuch areas as health, education and humanitarian\r\nassistance.\r\nThere is indeed no alternative to the United Nations.\r\nYet it is also true that, as we face the daunting array of\r\nchallenges that confront today’s world, there is a crisis of\r\ncommitment to the United Nations, a crisis of confidence\r\nin the Organization.\r\nLet this solemn commemoration and this fiftieth\r\nanniversary year help us to overcome our difficulties and\r\nequip the United Nations to face the future.\r\nLet us summon the political will and determination\r\nneeded in order to succeed.\r\nLet us develop a true spirit of global partnership\r\nbased on mutual trust and respect which is essential in\r\ntoday’s global neighbourhood.\r\nLet us imbue our deliberations with a greater sense\r\nof mission and clarity of purpose.\r\nLet us place people, in particular, the less fortunate\r\nand the most vulnerable of the world’s peoples, at the\r\ncentre of our concerns.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nLet us resolve to use the lessons derived from 50\r\nyears of experience to confront the myriad and complex\r\nchallenges before us.\r\nLet us not be afraid to re-examine concepts and adopt\r\nnew approaches in accordance with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nLet us, above all, provide the Organization with the\r\nfinancial and material resources required for the many\r\ncomplex and varied tasks which it must perform.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairperson of the\r\nDelegation of Trinidad and Tobago for her statement.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Annette des Iles, Chairperson of\r\nthe Delegation of Trinidad and Tobago, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Tuiloma Neroni Slade,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of Samoa\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nTuiloma Neroni Slade, Chairman of the Delegation of\r\nSamoa.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Chairman\r\nof the Delegation of Samoa, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Slade: A better world was sought 50 years ago.\r\nThere was need to restructure from the devastation of war\r\na new order premised on peace, justice and well-being for\r\nall.\r\nThat we are able to meet here today, a vastly\r\nincreased United Nations, is surely testimony to our\r\nendeavours. The dramatic transformation of the world’s\r\npolitical map and membership of the Organization from the\r\n51 States which first met as the General Assembly to\r\nalmost fourfold today, enriched by observer States and\r\norganizations, brings us nearer to the goal of universality.\r\nMy own country, like so many in this Hall, came to\r\nindependence through the process of decolonization made\r\npossible only through the central role played by the United\r\nNations. That process was a historic achievement. The\r\ninternational consciousness and the moral and the political\r\nunderpinnings forged are with us today. It is one of the\r\nmany achievements of our first 50 years that we bear in\r\nmind as we celebrate.\r\nSamoa judges by its experience. We found the\r\nLeague of Nations unresponsive and we were\r\ndisillusioned. The United Nations was truer to our\r\naspirations. Today, the United Nations remains a\r\nsignificant part of the modern development and progress\r\nof my country.\r\nIt is therefore with complete faith that on this\r\noccasion Samoa renews its commitment to the Charter.\r\nWe do so as a small country and with abiding trust in the\r\nprinciples set out in the Charter. The principles are sound;\r\nwhat is missing is the will to apply them.\r\nWe believe very deeply in the sustaining power of\r\ninternational law in support of the Charter principles. The\r\nUnited Nations has been a necessary and a cohesive force\r\nin the elaboration of international law and the rules for\r\ninternational cooperation which now regulate a\r\nphenomenal range of human activity.\r\nAn important development in recent years has been\r\nthe very high rate of State-party adherence to international\r\ninstruments and the acceptance of international\r\nprogrammes on the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\r\nand other areas.\r\nMuch more, though, is needed by way of concrete\r\naction in compliance with treaty obligations; it is also\r\nnecessary to implement Agenda 21 and other agreed\r\nprogrammes of action like that on the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island states.\r\nSamoa prays for the day of effective disarmament\r\nand the total elimination of nuclear weapons. A\r\ncomprehensive treaty on the banning of nuclear testing\r\nnext year is a first priority. We welcome the announced\r\nintention of France, the United Kingdom and the United\r\nStates to adhere to the South Pacific nuclear-free zone\r\nTreaty. But we need to say again to France that we\r\ncondemn its nuclear explosions in the Pacific. They are\r\ndangerous experiments posing a very serious threat to the\r\nhealth and the environment of my country and our region,\r\nand must stop. Of the entire United Nations membership,\r\nSamoa is located closest to the test site.\r\nWorld peace and the conditions for peace are not to\r\nhand. Too many are without human security. We think far\r\ntoo much is still being spent on armies than on the\r\nenvironment, education and health. More than half of the\r\nworld’s population is without food. And some countries\r\nare three thousand times more prosperous than others.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nScience, technology and industrial progress remain in the\r\nhands of too few.\r\nThese are awesome challenges that must remain for\r\ntomorrow, recognizing that it is perhaps easier to diagnose\r\nthe world’s problems than to find the solutions, and easier\r\nto formulate solutions than to get the public to accept them.\r\nSolutions are beyond the capacity of individual States; they\r\nmust remain the object of United Nations focus and action.\r\nIt is all too tempting to the sceptic to retreat from\r\nsupport and to lay the failures at the door of the United\r\nNations. But it is unfair to do so. The power of correction\r\nlies not here, but in capitals. We now have an Organization\r\nstructured by a few, half a century ago, that has to respond\r\nto the needs of many more, and to a world, and to world\r\nforces, which are fundamentally different and which\r\ncontinue to change. It needs to be reformed and assured the\r\nfinancial resources it needs, and strengthened to prepare it\r\nfor the years ahead.\r\nMembership of the Security Council must be enlarged\r\nto reflect the realities of the present time and to enhance its\r\neffectiveness and legitimacy.\r\nAssuredly, this also is an occasion of thanksgiving —\r\nto the Secretary-General, and all who support him at\r\nHeadquarters, to the entire United Nations staff worldwide,\r\nand to all Member States who toil in this Hall and in many\r\nsimilar halls all over the world, daily, year in, year out.\r\nWe do not make little of the disappointments and of\r\nthe failures. But, with the five decades of achievements,\r\nand a world of infinite promise, Samoa is very firmly of\r\nthe view that the future is on the side of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of Samoa for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Chairman\r\nof the Delegation of Samoa, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Aboul-Nasr,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of the League of Arab\r\nStates\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I call on the next speaker, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mahmoud Aboul-Nasr, Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of the League of Arab States.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Aboul-Nasr, Chairman\r\nof the Delegation of the League of Arab States, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Aboul-Nasr (interpretation from Arabic): The\r\nArab States celebrate two important occasions this year.\r\nWhile we participate in the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we have celebrated,\r\nvery recently, the fiftieth anniversary of the League of\r\nArab States, the Arab regional organization which was\r\nborn just a few months before the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations. The League’s charter included many\r\nprinciples and purposes that were proclaimed shortly\r\nthereafter by the Charter of the United Nations. The Arab\r\nStates participated in the drafting of the United Nations\r\nCharter and have taken part in the work of the\r\nOrganization for the past 50 years. Today, the Arab\r\nStates, like all other Member States, look forward to a\r\nnew phase, a phase in which, we hope, peace and justice\r\nwill prevail and in which human rights and man’s\r\nfundamental freedoms will be respected all over the\r\nworld. We look forward to a new phase in which the old\r\ncolonialist concepts will disappear together with the logic\r\nof aggression, the use of force and the occupation of the\r\nlands of others.\r\nWe look forward, at the threshold of the third\r\nmillennium, to an era in which every nation would be\r\nable to enjoy social and genuine cultural and economic\r\ndevelopment; an era in which every State would abide by\r\nthe United Nations Charter; an era in which every United\r\nNations resolution would be implemented without\r\ndistinction and without the application of double\r\nstandards; an era in which every people without\r\ndistinction, would enjoy just and lasting peace; an era in\r\nwhich every State would support the efforts of the United\r\nNations and share in improving its performance so that it\r\nmay be able to do all that is expected of it, especially in\r\nthe areas of peacemaking, peace-keeping and prosperity.\r\nWe look forward to a United Nations that will build\r\non its undeniable achievements in such areas as\r\ndecolonization, the codification of the norms of\r\ncooperation between States in many areas, such as the\r\nenvironment, outer space, the seas, human rights, trade\r\nand arms control, and many others. Those past\r\nachievements of the United Nations are a source of hope.\r\nThey strengthen our resolve to score further successes.\r\nWhile we in the Arab world would welcome all the\r\nsteps that have been taken towards the achievement of a\r\npeaceful settlement to the Palestinian question and the\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nMiddle East problem, we look forward to the completion of\r\nthe steps needed for the establishment in our region of a\r\njust and lasting peace that would be founded on the\r\nprinciples decided by the United Nations. We are\r\ndetermined to oppose the attempts to marginalize the\r\nOrganization’s important role in the quest for the desired\r\nsolutions. No matter what sort of criticism might be\r\nlevelled at the United Nations, we cannot but recognize that\r\nthe Organization has been and will continue to be the\r\ninternational forum wherein all States can participate in\r\npromoting the sort of international relations that would be\r\nbased on justice and equality.\r\nToday, as we congratulate the Organization on the\r\npassage of 50 years since its establishment, we must seize\r\nthe unique opportunity of the presence of such an\r\nimpressive number of Heads of State and Government to\r\ntake stock of the realities of the new international milieu we\r\nall live in particularly in the light of the fundamental\r\nchanges that have taken place over the past few years. In so\r\ndoing, we have to benefit from the object-lessons of the\r\npast, cherish the achievements that have been made and,\r\nthereby, manage to enrich the twenty-first century with a\r\nUnited Nations that is adequately equipped with the means\r\nand the machineries that would enable it to serve the\r\npeoples in whose name it was created.\r\nIn conclusion, may I, on behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Arab League, extend to you, Mr. President,\r\nand to the United Nations Secretary-General our most\r\nsincere congratulations, and assurances of the Arab\r\nLeague’s continued cooperation with this international\r\nOrganization in the service of the common cause of the two\r\norganizations: peace and development.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of the League of Arab States for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Aboul-Nasr, Chairman\r\nof the Delegation of the League of Arab States, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Hans van den Broek,\r\nmember of the European Commission\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I now call on His Excellency Mr. Hans\r\nvan den Broek, Member of the European Commission, on\r\nbehalf of the European Community.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hans van den Broek, member of\r\nthe European Commission, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. van den Broek: It is an honour to address this\r\nAssembly on behalf of the European Community. It is\r\nindeed a unique opportunity to highlight the achievements\r\nof the United Nations and to give new impetus to its\r\nfuture work.\r\nUndoubtedly the achievements of the past are\r\nimpressive. The United Nations has contributed vastly to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, and\r\nit has been a vital player in the fields of disarmament,\r\nnon-proliferation and development cooperation. The\r\nUnited Nations has been at the forefront in the promotion\r\nof human rights, the eradication of disease and the\r\nprotection of the environment. The United Nations has\r\nbeen playing a crucial role in alleviating the plight of\r\nrefugees and in supplying humanitarian aid all over the\r\nworld. It has embodied some of the purest and noblest\r\naspirations of mankind’s perennial quest for freedom and\r\nprosperity.\r\nI would therefore like to pay tribute to the United\r\nNations and to its successive Secretaries-General for all\r\nthat has been achieved despite so many difficulties and\r\nobstacles.\r\nBut the present agenda of the United Nations has\r\nbecome more complex and more demanding than at any\r\nother time in the Organization’s history. Instability has\r\nentrenched itself in many parts of the world. We have\r\nbeen witnessing the revival of nationalisms, of ethnic\r\ncleansing, of unprecedented humanitarian crises, of gross\r\nviolations of human rights, and even of genocide. The\r\nworld therefore needs the United Nations today more than\r\never — a strong and effective United Nations adapted to\r\nthe new agenda, unhampered by the ideological\r\ncontroversies of the past.\r\nHowever, the United Nations can only be as strong\r\nand effective as its Members permit. This also applies to\r\nits financial means. It would indeed be more than\r\nappropriate to mark this commemoration by putting the\r\nOrganization again on a sound financial footing.\r\nThe European Community has frequently expressed\r\nits full support for United Nations ideals and action.\r\nWhen the United Nations was established half a century\r\nago it enshrined the hopes of people who wished to\r\nprevent war, who had faith in human rights and who were\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\ncommitted to economic and social progress. Those who\r\nfounded the European Community were driven by a similar\r\nvision. Hence, it was natural to develop a close partnership\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nThis partnership has been translated into many hard\r\nfacts. Let me mention just a few of them. The European\r\nCommunity, through its Humanitarian Office, is the second-\r\nlargest single contributor to, and operational partner in, the\r\nwork of the High Commissioner for Refugees and is one of\r\nthe largest donors to the World Food Programme. Half of\r\nthe world’s trade subject to preferential treatment for\r\ndeveloping countries is being carried out by the\r\nCommunity. The European Community and its member\r\nStates give about half of the world’s total official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nWe must now agree on an innovative agenda for\r\ndevelopment. This agenda must, as far as we are concerned,\r\nsend two strong messages. The first message is of the\r\ncrucial need to put international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment at the centre of our common endeavours. The\r\nsecond message concerns the enhancement of the role and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in development. Our\r\nefforts will build upon the outcome of recent global\r\nconferences. Economic growth, social justice, the\r\nempowerment of women, the protection of the environment,\r\ndemocratic institutions and the promotion of all human\r\nrights must be seen as fundamental components of a\r\ncommon vision for a sustainable development.\r\nThe Commission of the European Union is determined\r\nto enhance its support for the United Nations. Our aim is to\r\nmake the Organization more effective, more capable of\r\nshaping a better and safer world and more operational in\r\nensuring freedom and prosperity for all.\r\nThe President: I thank the Member of the European\r\nCommission, speaking on behalf of the European\r\nCommunity, for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hans van den Broek, Member of\r\nthe European Commission, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Emile-Derlin Zinsou,\r\nPresident of the Permanent Council of Francophonie\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nEmile-Derlin Zinsou, President of the Permanent Council of\r\nFrancophonie, on behalf of the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Emile-Derlin Zinsou, President\r\nof the Permanent Council of Francophonie, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Zinsou (interpretation from French): Not long\r\nago, this Assembly considered a draft resolution,\r\nsubmitted by the group of countries whose common\r\nlanguage is French, concerning cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation. In adopting that resolution, the\r\nAssembly demonstrated its interest in the community of\r\nfrancophone countries, which I represent here today. I\r\nextend our warmest thanks.\r\nI am greatly honoured to tell this Assembly of the\r\nsustained attention with which the 47 States and\r\nGovernments that make up our community follow and\r\nsupport, within the framework of the francophone\r\ncommunity, the aims and initiatives of this Organization,\r\nto which I pay a solemn tribute and whose vitality on the\r\neve of the third millennium is so clearly reflected in the\r\ncelebration of its fiftieth anniversary today.\r\nThe Francophone community sees itself above all as\r\na place of solidarity. It finds unity in the diversity of its\r\nmembership, which extends to every continent. In this\r\nUnited Nations, a lofty forum for dialogue, and especially\r\nfor North-South dialogue, my presence attests to one of\r\nthe fundamental dimensions of that community, most of\r\nwhose members are from the South. The principal aim of\r\nour solidarity is development, the key factor for stability\r\nand security in today’s world.\r\nWe wish our activities to be consonant with the\r\ncrises besetting the contemporary world. We are devoting\r\nour priority efforts to promoting democracy, the rule of\r\nlaw and human rights, in the belief that no society can\r\nevolve towards economic and human development\r\nwithout a stable and legally appropriate policy framework.\r\nIn this regard, we are striving to direct our efforts\r\nincreasingly towards conflict prevention. The francophone\r\ncommunity intends shortly to step up its efforts in this\r\nfield.\r\nWe wish to be ready to meet the major challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century, such as control of demographic\r\nshifts, the maintenance of peace, environmental protection\r\nor the struggle against such terrible scourges as AIDS and\r\ndrugs. Our presence in Rio, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nand Beijing at the world conferences organized by the\r\nUnited Nations on problems familiar to us all and our\r\ncommunity’s contribution to building the consensuses\r\nachieved there and their follow-up attest to that resolve.\r\nWe are aware of the difficulties and even the\r\nparadoxes involved in many situations. Let me cite but two\r\nexamples on my own continent, Africa. How can we fail to\r\nsee that the movement towards democracy, so eagerly\r\ninitiated, has bogged down in ever-proliferating conflicts?\r\nHow can one fail to note that the efforts being made to\r\nprotect the environment are being increasingly hampered by\r\ndrought, famine and creeping desertification in our\r\ncountries?\r\nSuch examples enable us to gauge the uncertain results\r\nof our efforts, but we are all the more resolved to pursue\r\nthem, knowing that they are shared, with the same\r\ndetermination, by the entire international community.\r\nMoreover, by honouring us with his presence at the Fifth\r\nConference of Heads of State and Government of the\r\ncountries with French as a common language, which was\r\nheld in October 1993 in Mauritius, the Secretary-General\r\ngave us the opportunity to define our common ground and\r\nto confirm the francophone community’s full support for\r\nhis work. I wish here once again to pay a tribute to his\r\nendeavours and to tell him how enthusiastically we look\r\nforward to reaffirming our support for him at the\r\nforthcoming summit to be hosted by my country, the\r\nRepublic of Benin, in early December 1995.\r\nThe extent to which the objectives of our group and\r\nthose of the United Nations coincide is evident. It has\r\nbecome even more apparent since the francophone\r\ncommunity strengthened its political activities by initiating\r\nthe summit meetings of Heads of State and Government.\r\nThis common ground must become even more tangible\r\nfrom this day forth. The member countries of the\r\nfrancophone world, together with the entire international\r\ncommunity, would greatly benefit thereby.\r\nIt is true that the francophone countries are relying on\r\ntheir specific solidarity — the foundation of their union on\r\nthe basis of their mission, the francophone movement — in\r\norder to create an entity for cooperation that can act as a\r\ncredible partner in the new world order. But their future\r\nremains closely linked to that of the entire international\r\ncommunity. The interdependence which today more than\r\never is a feature of international relations makes the\r\ndevelopment of some dependent on that of the rest. This\r\nencompasses all the problems of globalization and\r\nmarginalization to which the Secretary-General has referred\r\nwith such conviction in his address at this\r\nCommemorative Meeting.\r\nIt is in this spirit that the francophone community is\r\npreparing to play an active role at the United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements in Istanbul next year.\r\nThe value of that Conference and the issues at stake\r\ncannot leave us indifferent. Indeed, they touch on the very\r\ncontext within which our societies will evolve in the\r\nfuture.\r\nWe wish this shared aspiration to be squarely placed\r\nin the common service of progress, peace and\r\ndevelopment in the world. This is the role and duty which\r\nthe francophone community increasingly seeks to perform\r\nin the family of nations. It is the meaning of the\r\nresolution adopted by our Heads of State and Government\r\nin Mauritius on francophonie and international relations,\r\nin which they reaffirmed their resolute support, alongside\r\nother international bodies, for the efforts to find\r\nappropriate solutions to major political and economic\r\nproblems affecting the contemporary world and stated\r\ntheir determination to develop, alongside and within those\r\nbodies and during the great world Conferences, continued\r\nand enhanced francophone cooperation.\r\nThis is the objective of the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation in establishing representations with\r\ninternational organizations in Geneva since 1991, in\r\nBrussels since last year and, most recently, in New York\r\nwith the United Nations, the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund.\r\nOur message is thus a message of hope in the future\r\nof the United Nations and of our own resolve fully to\r\nparticipate in the universal consciousness that shines over\r\nthe work of the United Nations. It is our purpose thereby\r\nto contribute to the great value of this institution as a\r\nmeeting place for the world’s cultures and civilizations\r\nand the instrument of choice for the advancement of\r\npeace and development in the world.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nPermanent Council of Francophonie, speaking on behalf\r\nof the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation, for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Emile-Derlin Zinsou, President\r\nof the Permanent Council of Francophonie, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Chief Emeka Anyaoku,\r\nSecretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I now call on His Excellency Chief\r\nEmeka Anyaoku, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth\r\nSecretariat.\r\nHis Excellency Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Commonwealth Secretariat, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Anyaoku: A decade ago, in commemorating the\r\nfortieth anniversary of the United Nations, Commonwealth\r\nleaders, in their Nassau Declaration on World Order,\r\naffirmed their commitment to the goal of strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations system as the central instrument of peace,\r\nsecurity and cooperation. On this historic fiftieth\r\nanniversary, I am honoured to reaffirm that solemn\r\ncommitment and support.\r\nThe Commonwealth has representation from every\r\ncontinent. It includes people of the world’s major races,\r\nreligions, cultures and traditions. Its member countries are\r\nat every stage of socio-economic development and comprise\r\nmore than one quarter of the United Nation’s membership.\r\nThe Commonwealth is, therefore, more than a regional\r\ngroup; it is a global sub-system in the world community.\r\nThe importance which Commonwealth Governments\r\naccord to the United Nations is a testimony of their\r\ncommitment to multilateralism. Commonwealth leaders\r\nwere among the visionaries who framed and signed the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. And Commonwealth countries\r\ncontinue to contribute to the work of the Organization in\r\nmany significant areas, including peace-keeping operations,\r\nin which Commonwealth countries rank among the leading\r\ntroop contributors.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations has endured for 50\r\nyears and provided inspiration for many seminal\r\nachievements. To mention but a few, the United Nations\r\nhas contributed to the process of decolonization; provided\r\na means of conflict resolution and containment; facilitated\r\nthe development and extension of international law; and\r\nprovided a means of mobilizing world concern and action\r\non a range of global problems such as the environment,\r\ndisarmament, trade and development, and human rights.\r\nIn the dramatically transformed global environment of\r\nthe post-cold-war era, the Organization has been obliged to\r\nmake unprecedented and far-reaching decisions in response\r\nto the mounting incidence of intra-State conflict and\r\nstrife. International attention is rightly focusing not only\r\non how to tackle such situations, but, more important, on\r\nhow to prevent them from arising in the first place.\r\nFaced with new challenges and opportunities, it is\r\nright that the reform and adaptation of the United Nations\r\nshould have become a pressing priority. Numerous\r\nproposals have been made for structural, programmatic\r\nand managerial reform of the United Nations, its organs\r\nand its agencies, including the Security Council, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. But, whatever the merit of any individual\r\nproposals, the underlying imperative must be a\r\nrecognition that the institutions and arrangements\r\nfashioned 50 years ago, in the age of colonialism and in\r\nthe aftermath of a hugely destructive world war, are\r\nscarcely adequate to the demands of the present age. That\r\nis why the Commonwealth supports meaningful and\r\nspeedy reform. A strong and effective United Nations is\r\ncrucial to building a more humane world order.\r\nThe United Nations is the globe’s only truly\r\nuniversal Organization, held by Member States in trust for\r\nthe world’s people. We hold firmly that the effectiveness\r\nof the Organization is directly linked to the commitment\r\nand support of its constituents. The commitment of all\r\nMember States — including those of the\r\nCommonwealth — to the United Nations should reflect\r\ntheir determination to strengthen it and make it the\r\ndynamic and strong Organization which they have\r\nconsistently advocated.\r\nAnd so, as we celebrate this fiftieth anniversary, the\r\ntask before Member States is to enhance the capacity of\r\nthe Organization to respond to the problems at hand. This\r\nrequires us to update its system and to ensure that we\r\nmeet our obligations to enable it to face the challenges of\r\nthe next 50 years.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nCommonwealth Secretariat for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Commonwealth Secretariat, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: Before adjourning the meeting, I\r\nshould like to ask all members and delegations to be very\r\npunctual tomorrow at 10 a.m. and at 3 p.m., because\r\ntomorrow we have, as the Assembly knows, the longest\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 3 p.m.\r\nlist of speakers and therefore we need punctuality even\r\nmore than today and yesterday.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.45 p.m.\r\n37\r\n"
