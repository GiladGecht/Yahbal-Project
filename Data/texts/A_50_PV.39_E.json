(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 29 (continued)\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations\r\nThe President: This morning we hold the fifth\r\nmeeting of the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nLet me begin by reminding all delegations that today\r\nis 24 October, the fiftieth birthday of the United Nations. I\r\nwould like to stress this fact, and to express the hope that\r\nour final meetings of today will help us celebrate these 50\r\nyears of the life of the Organization. All the peoples of the\r\nworld, who join with us in this commemoration, hope that\r\nthe United Nations will be able to continue to serve\r\nhumanity so nobly in the future.\r\nBefore calling on the first speaker, I should like to\r\nmake an announcement regarding the programme of the last\r\nmeeting of the Special Commemorative Meeting this\r\nafternoon.\r\nAfter hearing statements by all Member States, the\r\nAssembly will proceed to take action on the draft resolution\r\nwhich appears in paragraph 2 of the report (A/50/48) of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations and which contains the Declaration on\r\nthe Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Declaration is expected to be adopted by\r\nacclamation.\r\nThereafter, the Assembly will hear the remaining\r\nspeakers, and the Secretary-General and I will make\r\nclosing statements.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Runaldo Ronald\r\nVenetiaan, President of the Republic of Suriname\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Runaldo Ronald\r\nVenetiaan, President of the Republic of Suriname.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Venetiaan: It is an honour for me to\r\naddress the General Assembly today, on the birthday of\r\nthe United Nations. In the past 50 years the United\r\nNations has guided the peoples of the world past the cliffs\r\nof the cold war between East and West, through regional\r\nconflicts and the many eruptions of uncounted dormant\r\ncontroversies among groups within a given nation, and\r\nalso through the dark depths of poverty, disease,\r\ndiscrimination and ignorance.\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nIn confronting these challenges the United Nations has\r\ngiven individuals and institutions, Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations the opportunity to come\r\nforward and distinguish themselves as true servants of\r\nhumanity, and as workers for peace, for justice and for\r\nwell-being. The contribution of our Organization of nations\r\nhas ensured that the suffering of the world owing to natural\r\ndisasters and caused by human beings themselves has not\r\nbecome a source of despair for humanity. The endeavours\r\nof the United Nations have generated positive expectations\r\nfor harmony among human beings and for harmony\r\nbetween humankind and nature.\r\nIn this spirit, the Government and the people of\r\nSuriname congratulate the United Nations on the occasion\r\nof its fiftieth anniversary, and, filled with hope, they face\r\nthe future together with the Organization. This, however,\r\ndoes not mean that Suriname wishes to ignore the reality of\r\nthe many threats which endanger our world and the\r\nproblems the United Nations has to face within its own\r\nstructure.\r\nThere are still many obstacles to overcome in the\r\npolitical, economic and social spheres and in the quest of\r\nthe international community for a more just, equitable,\r\nsecure, peaceful and democratic world. The eruption of\r\nextreme nationalism, ethnic strife and excessive religious\r\nzeal multiplies tension, tears societies and States apart, and\r\nthreatens world security. Economic and social imbalances\r\nstill deprive the majority of humankind of development and\r\nprogress.\r\nAgreed strategies, such as those aimed at curbing\r\npopulation growth or at protecting the environment, are\r\nsometimes, for reasons of political or economic\r\ncompetition, affected by hidden agendas, with a view to\r\ncontrolling the political and economic progress of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe United Nations system has proven to be a major\r\nmechanism at the international level, creative enough to put\r\na common vision and a common approach into effect\r\nthrough multilateral cooperation combining collective action\r\nwith respect for national sovereignty.\r\nWe call upon the international community to\r\ncontribute fully to the definition and implementation of the\r\nnew role of the United Nations, which undoubtedly is of a\r\nhumanitarian nature, and aims at protecting and preserving\r\nlife on our planet and at raising the standard of living of all\r\npeoples, through the establishment of a new, balanced and\r\nequitable international economic and social order.\r\nThere is no doubt that unless we overcome and\r\nrectify certain shortcomings of the United Nations, this\r\nOrganization will not be able to play its fundamental role\r\nin the management of the new world order; neither will\r\nit be able to realize its noble principles. Thus, a most\r\nurgent task for the international community now is to\r\nreinvigorate, restructure and democratize the United\r\nNations and to give it a sound a financial basis for the\r\nfulfilment of old and new tasks, in order to relieve\r\ninternational relations of suspicion and hostility, to bring\r\nan end to violence, and to fully activate the creative\r\npotential of the United Nations for the sound development\r\nof the peoples of the world.\r\nWe, the family of nations, with political will and in\r\na spirit of understanding, can successfully chart the course\r\nof the world towards an order which will be more\r\nresponsive to the needs and interests of humankind.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Suriname for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ramiro De León\r\nCarpio, President of the Republic of Guatemala\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ramiro De León Carpio,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ramiro De León Carpio,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident De León Carpio (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Guatemala, which has participated in the work\r\nof the United Nations from the first, is present today at\r\nthis unique congress, which has brought together world\r\nleaders to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the San\r\nFrancisco Charter. The founders were mindful of the\r\ntragedy of the two world wars; to ward off similar wars,\r\nthey created a forum for dialogue and the harmonization\r\nof policies, set forth principles for the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes and charged an executive body with\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. But they also sought to create a new order based\r\non justice for all peoples and nations great and small,\r\naffirming their common right to live in the same\r\nconditions of security, harmony and freedom.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThere can never be justice or peace if we deny the\r\nright of every human being and every nation to engage in\r\ndialogue on a footing of equality and above all to enjoy the\r\nidentical dignity without which no member of our species\r\ncan truly be free, without the shackles of poverty and\r\nwithout the bitterness of the hatred engendered by\r\ninequality. This is why we believe that universal\r\nrepresentation should prevail at the United Nations, without\r\nany kind of exclusion.\r\nLet us begin, then, by recognizing that we still have\r\nsome way to go before we can affirm that peace has been\r\nattained. We still endure bloody conflicts that must be\r\nbrought to an end once and for all, because they are\r\nanachronistic, because they are anti-economic, because they\r\nare unjust, because they are immoral, but above all because\r\nthey are inhuman. But peace is not merely the absence of\r\nwar. Peace is also economic and social, and in this\r\nconnection we, the least developed nations, have merely\r\nasked to be allowed to compete in conditions of fairness, so\r\nthat our products may have access to the market without\r\nbeing subject to any unjustifiable barriers or conditions not\r\nbased on economic considerations.\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II, who in this Hall made\r\na dramatic appeal for an end to injustice between men and\r\nbetween nations, affirmed that development is the new\r\nname of peace. It will never be possible to achieve this\r\npeace unless the national policies of the strongest and most\r\npowerful countries are promptly transformed into positive\r\naction towards democratic consolidation, leading, certainly,\r\nto economic globalization, but also to political and social\r\nglobalization; ensuring economic growth, but growth with\r\na human and a social face, enabling poor countries to attain\r\nthe true independence and sovereign equality to which we\r\nare all fully entitled.\r\nWe are met to evaluate our Organization; we must\r\nadmit our mistakes, and learn from them, but we must also\r\nrecognize the effects of a general peace, which give us the\r\ntime and space to address the human problems of poverty,\r\ninequality and injustice, which from the very birth of this\r\ninstitution have been an essential part of its agenda, but\r\nwhich still recur with tragic frequency.\r\nWith the fall of the Berlin wall the cold war came to\r\nan end without bloodshed. We face a new reality that lays\r\na heavy responsibility on large economic blocs, which must\r\nhave due regard for the ordeals our societies have endured.\r\nAbove all, we must recall the tragic lessons we have\r\nlearned and realize that justice cannot be built on\r\ninequality, that, similarly, peace cannot be built on hatred,\r\nand that democracy can be made effective and functional\r\nonly through the sum of the actions we take to promote\r\nit, without ever resorting to the excuse that we have\r\nstarted a war or committed an injustice to preserve that\r\ndemocracy.\r\nI wish finally to say that soon the people of\r\nGuatemala will freely elect a new Chief Executive, to\r\nwhom I shall hand over the presidency, with the\r\nsatisfaction of having headed a transitional Government\r\nthat has fulfilled the primary mandate with which it was\r\nentrusted — to rescue, preserve and strengthen\r\ninstitutional legality and democracy, both of which had\r\nbeen seriously impaired — and also with the satisfaction\r\nof having, through the democratic process of consulting\r\nthe people, removed corrupt members of Congress and\r\nthe Supreme Court from office. I shall relinquish the\r\npresidency with the satisfaction of being able to say to the\r\nworld that, by dint of strenuous efforts, we have made\r\nheadway in the observance of human rights, which have\r\nsuffered such serious breaches in Guatemala. We are still\r\nexperiencing difficulties; but Guatemala is not what it\r\nused to be. I shall, finally, leave office with the further\r\nsatisfaction of having strengthened civilian authority,\r\nassigning to the army the role that it should play in a\r\ndemocratic system, and initiating national reconciliation.\r\nTo this should be added my satisfaction at having fought\r\npoverty, corruption, drug-related activities, terrorism and\r\nimpunity.\r\nBut having expressed my satisfaction at these\r\nfavourable developments, as President of all Guatemalans\r\nand as ex-Ombudsman for human rights I must also share\r\nwith you the anguish and sadness I feel because my\r\ncountrymen continue to suffer death, desolation,\r\ndestruction and the bereavement of widows and orphans,\r\nall of which is the result of a foreign war that hurled us\r\ninto the vortex of an internal conflict that has raged for\r\n35 years. This entitles me to make a fervent appeal to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for this community to strengthen and\r\nsupport us in our ongoing peace process, not only by\r\nfulfilling the institutional obligation that the Organization\r\nhas assumed, but also with the open hand of international\r\nsolidarity in the political and economic fields.\r\nHuman life is being lost. The guns must fall silent.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Guatemala for his statement.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ramiro De León Carpio, President\r\nof the Republic of Guatemala, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. José María Figueres,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. José María Figueres,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. José María Figueres, President of\r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Figueres (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nhave come here to celebrate together 50 years of the United\r\nNations. Many of us agree that this is the right time to\r\npause and consider the achievements and the shortcomings\r\nof this Organization. It is also an excellent opportunity to\r\nlook at new dreams and challenges for the future.\r\nWe all recognize that in these past 50 years the United\r\nNations has, at decisive moments, been able to tilt the\r\nworld towards peace and solidarity.\r\nCosta Rica has participated from the beginning as a\r\nfounder of this Organization. Trusting in it, we abolished\r\nour army two years after the founding of the United\r\nNations. Since then we have lived in peace. Not having an\r\narmy has enabled us to invest more resources in health,\r\neducation and housing. According to United Nations\r\nindicators, this year Costa Rica came first in human\r\ndevelopment in Latin America.\r\nWhen, in Costa Rica, we were thinking about how to\r\ncelebrate this fiftieth anniversary which has brought us\r\ntogether today, we had the idea of proclaiming an\r\ninternational week for peace. Our proposal was approved\r\nunanimously by all the countries represented here, and we\r\nwould like to thank those who joined in or supported this\r\ninitiative, which begins today.\r\nIn these 50 years, and particularly in the last few\r\nyears, the region of Central America has also made major\r\nprogress. We have moved from an authoritarian Central\r\nAmerica divided by war to a democratic and united Central\r\nAmerica which today is building its future through a\r\nregional alliance for sustainable development.\r\nIts central objective is the greater well-being of our\r\npeople. It therefore includes the preservation of the cultural\r\nidentity of indigenous peoples and the full involvement of\r\nwomen in the development process. This latter aspect\r\nmay be one of the most powerful instruments for\r\ncombatting poverty. But the alliance goes further: looking\r\nto the future, it includes universal environmental concerns\r\nsuch as the preservation of biodiversity, the ozone layer\r\nand the seas.\r\nThis fiftieth anniversary comes at a time of transition\r\nfor the world, and also coincides with Costa Rica’s\r\nassumption of the presidency of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina for the coming year. The Group of 77, which was\r\nborn within the context of the United Nations to combat\r\neconomic injustices among strong and weaker nations,\r\nalready has a distinguished history. Yet, on the threshold\r\nof a new millennium, its main challenge persists and its\r\ndreams have not yet come true.\r\nThe trend towards the globalization of the economy\r\ncould generate advantages for all humanity. But the\r\nstruggle between powerful trade blocs has increased the\r\ninjustices among nations. Much is being said today about\r\nfree trade, but in actual fact those countries that have less\r\nnot only have to struggle over prices for their products,\r\nbut they also have to face new trade barriers. They are\r\nrequired to comply very strictly with international norms,\r\nwhile the more powerful are allowed to depart from the\r\nagreements they have signed.\r\nWe must not give up on the dreams of the Group of\r\n77 and China. We must reaffirm those dreams, and we\r\nmust find new ways of making them come true.\r\nAccordingly, the United Nations must strengthen the\r\nforums for negotiation, dialogue and the quest for\r\nagreement. To remain true to the spirit of San Francisco,\r\nwhich gave birth to this Organization, it must not remain\r\nneutral or passive in the face of major conflicts. Rather,\r\nit should do more. The new challenges include assuming\r\nresponsibility for protecting and preserving global assets.\r\nOnly an Organization that represents equally all the\r\npeoples of the earth can be successful in this undertaking.\r\nWe dream of a United Nations that encourages forums of\r\ncooperation among all nations to reduce the greenhouse\r\neffect, to save, study and make use of the biodiversity of\r\nthe planet, to decontaminate the seas and, thereby, to\r\nensure the greater well-being of present and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nToday let us think of our peoples. Let us renew our\r\ncommitment to work in the United Nations to move\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\ntowards a world of peace, equity and solidarity, advancing\r\nalong the road towards sustainable development.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Costa Rica for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. José María Figueres, President of\r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Perez\r\nBalladares, President of the Republic of Panama\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Perez Balladares,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Perez Balladares,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Perez Balladares (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Events such as this are taking place these days in\r\nmany of our countries, including my own, not so much to\r\nmark an anniversary as to thank the United Nations for all\r\nit has done in helping to fashion today’s world.\r\nInjustice still persists, poverty is endemic in vast\r\nregions of the world, respect for human rights for many of\r\nits inhabitants is no more than a dream and wars have not\r\ncompletely vanished. But, despite this apparently bleak\r\npicture, we should ask ourselves what our world would be\r\nlike with the destructive power of nuclear weapons and\r\nwithout the United Nations.\r\nThe genuinely far-reaching importance of the\r\nOrganization can be measured not in terms that are\r\nquantifiable, but in terms of intangible but real values: the\r\nwars that were never fought, the victims that never died\r\nbecause of them, the children who were not orphaned\r\nbecause their parents did not have to die in a war that no\r\none understood.\r\nWhen we look at the record of these 50 years, many\r\nwill say that the Organization has been an arena for sterile\r\ndebate, but it is preferable for the world to have a forum in\r\nwhich conflicts can spend themselves in words rather than\r\nconstantly to seek battlefields on which to resolve disputes\r\nof its own invention. It is better for the world to have an\r\nOrganization awash with words rather than battlefields\r\nstrewn with the dead.\r\nPanama is a signatory of the Organization’s Charter\r\nand enjoys the rare honour of having had a Security\r\nCouncil meeting take place on its soil, for when every\r\ndiplomatic channel seemed closed to my country the\r\nholding of a Council meeting away from Headquarters\r\nbrought Panama’s claims concerning the Canal to the\r\nworld’s attention to an unprecedented degree. A few years\r\nlater we saw the conclusion of negotiations which\r\nterminated a colonial jurisdiction, known as the Canal\r\nZone, and we are now about to begin — it will happen\r\nbefore the end of the century — to operate and administer\r\nthe inter-oceanic waterway. For this reason we also ask\r\nourselves whether our future would today be as promising\r\nhad this forum not existed, this unique body in which the\r\nrift of differences, however wide, can be bridged and in\r\nwhich discussions can take place between Governments\r\non an equal footing however unequal they may be in\r\nterms of wealth or military might.\r\nIt is not the world that has grown since Panama\r\ntogether with some 50 other countries, signed the United\r\nNations Charter 50 years ago. What has grown is the\r\nnumber of States that have become independent and\r\nwelcomed into this Organization; what has grown is the\r\nhopes of millions of young people no longer faced with\r\nthe cruel prospect of dying in senseless and meaningless\r\nwars. What perhaps best demonstrates the changes that\r\nthe world has undergone in this half century since the\r\nSecond World War is that two of the nations upon whose\r\nmilitary defeats the Organization was based today\r\njustifiably aspire to become permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, and that the language of exclusion has\r\ngiven way to the of universalization of this body.\r\nOur commitment to the United Nations is to help\r\nmake its mission effective in the next 50 years. We do\r\nthe Organization no service by blaming it for its mistakes\r\nor being content with its many successes. The\r\nOrganization helped to heal the wounds of a world war;\r\nnow it must help to bridge the ever-widening\r\ntechnological and educational gulf between its Member\r\nnations. The poor countries — the majority of the\r\ncountries — do not aspire to bring their armies up to the\r\nlevels of the military Powers, but they have abundant\r\nreason for hoping that the insuperable gap in terms of\r\ntechnology and military power will not also become an\r\nunbridgeable educational abyss.\r\nIf this purpose is fulfilled to an acceptable degree,\r\nthose who come here to celebrate the centenary of the\r\nOrganization in the year 2045 will have as many reasons\r\nfor being grateful to it as today’s generation has, for\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nhaving spared the world the horrors of a war which might\r\nwell have spelt the end of mankind.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Panama for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Perez Balladares,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Rafael Caldera,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Venezuela\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Rafael Caldera, President of\r\nthe Republic of Venezuela.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rafael Caldera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Caldera (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\n11 November 1918 the world joyfully greeted the end of\r\nthe First World War. The winner set themselves the goal of\r\nlaying the foundation for everlasting peace. The League of\r\nNations was created in Geneva; political maps were\r\nmodified, great empires were broken up and the principle\r\nof nationalities was applied to establish the limits of States.\r\nTwenty years later a conflagration broke out, of such\r\nmagnitude that the horrors of the earlier war seemed to pale\r\nin comparison. When this conflict ended there was\r\nenormous fear of a relapse. A third world war would\r\ninevitably have meant the total annihilation of the human\r\nrace. The weapons of destruction went beyond what man’s\r\nimagination could have conceived. Astonishingly, man\r\nrevealed himself capable of successfully devising the\r\ninstruments for his own destruction.\r\nSimply having avoided the dreadful possibility of a\r\nnew catastrophe is sufficient justification for this celebration\r\ntoday. There are reasons to congratulate ourselves on this\r\nmeaningful fiftieth anniversary, in whose success we all\r\nshare fully. We cannot deny that the threat of nuclear war\r\nwas a decisive factor for peace, but so also was the\r\nexistence of this forum, where all nations, large and small,\r\nfrom all continents and of all ethnic descents, can state their\r\nviews, their demands, their aspirations and their complaints.\r\nThe unexpected end of the cold war opened the door\r\nto new dreams. However, subsequent events have shown\r\nthe need to face new and emerging situations across the\r\nworld so that peace, the fundamental purpose of the\r\nOrganization, may be strengthened and built on secure\r\nand stable foundations.\r\nA new half century is beginning for the United\r\nNations. We must prepare the Organization for a new era\r\nwith a new agenda. We must analyse in depth the causes\r\nof instability and find ways of ensuring peace. The Holy\r\nFather, John Paul II, spoke in this very forum of the need\r\nto guarantee the human rights of nations in order to\r\ncomplement the human rights of people, proclaimed in\r\nthe Universal Declaration of 1948.\r\nI believe that among the human rights of nations, we\r\nshould give special attention to those relating to\r\ninternational social justice which recognizes the right of\r\nevery people to promote its development on its own terms\r\nand to request that the international community remove\r\nobstacles such as the burden of external debt and make\r\navailable the tools needed to contribute to universal well-\r\nbeing.\r\nAfter the First World War, when the roar of the\r\ncannons could still be heard, world leaders understood the\r\nimportance of social justice and created the International\r\nLabour Organization, which survived the League of\r\nNations. During the Second World War, thinking that\r\nvictory was imminent, the leaders of the allied countries,\r\ntraumatized by the intensity of the conflict, declared in\r\nPhiladelphia that poverty anywhere constitutes a danger\r\nfor the prosperity of all. This should not be forgotten. It\r\nwould be criminal and suicidal to ignore it.\r\nIt is naive to think that the free interplay of\r\neconomic forces, whose importance we admit, would be\r\nsufficient to eradicate poverty. This has been recognized\r\nby the United Nations. We are more conscious of the fact\r\nthat the human element is fundamental to its existence.\r\nMany of us are willing to fight for the poor, even at the\r\nrisk of being called “populists”. We must fight against\r\nboth the effects and the causes of poverty. We cannot\r\nsimply disregard the conviction that justice is the basis of\r\npeace. And social justice is an important aspect of justice.\r\nOn the other hand, experience worldwide points to\r\nanother potential threat: corruption in all forms and\r\nshapes, which results in the denial of justice. Repressing\r\ncorruption requires not only the decision of every State,\r\nbut also international solidarity. Yet, repressing it is not\r\nenough: we must prevent it. We must rescue ethical\r\nvalues for humanity.\r\nSo, let us speak frankly: antagonisms of all sorts,\r\npoverty, especially abject poverty, selfishness and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\ncorruption, which eat away at our conscience and destroy\r\ninstitutions, all represent the most serious threat to peace.\r\nThe peoples are eagerly waiting for us to assume our\r\nresponsibility of facing up to these dangers not in word\r\nonly but in deed.\r\nAntagonism, injustice, poverty and corruption are the\r\ngreatest enemies that we must fight in the new half-century\r\nthat is now dawning for the United Nations. It is time to\r\nstand up to those enemies, to turn our good intentions into\r\nreality. Let us then work to fulfil our duty, target our action\r\nand make it effective.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Venezuela for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rafael Caldera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Albert Zafy, President\r\nof the Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Albert Zafy, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Albert Zafy, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Zafy (interpretation from French): I am\r\ngratified to have this opportunity to attend this assembly of\r\nnations and I join with everyone here in celebrating this\r\ngreat event, the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. Fifty years! We are no longer young,\r\nbut neither are we old yet. This is maturity, an age replete\r\nwith usefulness and reason, the result of a wealth of\r\nexperience garnered over half a century.\r\nThe rapid recovery of the nations ruined by six years\r\nof war, the end of the cold war and the spectacular collapse\r\nof the Berlin Wall are some of the events that fuelled\r\npeople’s hopes for a better world, a world from which war,\r\npoverty, destitution and all forms of exploitation would be\r\nbanished for ever and where respect for rights, real and not\r\nsimply theoretical equality between nations, small and large,\r\nwould prevail.\r\nBut, we are bound to acknowledge that it is still a\r\ngreat step from precept to practice, from slogan to deed.\r\nThus, in our humble opinion, this anniversary provides\r\nus with an opportunity to take stock of the last half-century\r\nand to examine together ways and means to influence the\r\ncourse of the coming years to ensure that this\r\nOrganization can genuinely live up to the expectations of\r\nall the peoples of the world that yearn for peace, equality,\r\nrespect for human life, and peaceful technological\r\nprogress.\r\nThis special meeting of nations should not be merely\r\na symbolic and ritual commemoration — it should\r\nprovide an opportunity to take stock and reflect on a new\r\nstrategy for security, development and the future of\r\ndemocracy inside and outside our Organization.\r\nFor its part, Madagascar fully supports reform of the\r\nUnited Nations that is consistent with its true vocation.\r\nWe should give the General Assembly, the most\r\nrepresentative body of Members opinions, adequate\r\npowers, expand the Security Council on the basis of\r\ngeographical distribution so that it may truly become a\r\nbody for implementing General Assembly resolutions and\r\nreflect equality, and hence, democracy. Exercise of the\r\nright of veto is anti-democratic and therefore\r\nanachronistic.\r\nPoverty, drugs, the debt burden, the increase of\r\nfundamentalism, xenophobia, regional conflicts and\r\nunemployment are the evils dogging this century, the\r\nfruits of social injustice and economic imbalance.\r\nThere was a time when we feared the “yellow peril”.\r\nNow, our fears are focused on the “black peril” or the\r\n“coffee-coloured peril” with regard to immigrants in\r\nEurope. In the short term, this anxiety could help the third\r\nworld. The risk of destabilization as a result of\r\nimmigration has heightened the awareness of many people\r\nin favour of increased development assistance for the\r\nthird world to stem this exodus to rich countries.\r\nMany voices, including in the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) have been heard sounding an alarm to alert\r\ndecision-makers to tackle the root of the problem by\r\ninvesting more, for example, in the social sphere. But,\r\nthere is a school of thought that opposes the 20/20\r\ninitiative that has been adopted by the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, the\r\nWorld Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations and UNESCO to free\r\nup sufficient resources and which advocates budget\r\nreductions arguing that the needed financial resources are\r\nnot available.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nIt is deplorable to note that special or national interests\r\nsometimes prevail over the sense of solidarity that\r\nincreasing interdependence requires.\r\nAs a result of the global context we must provide the\r\nUnited Nations with the resources it needs to be able to\r\ncarry out its essential tasks, which are to ensure peace,\r\npromote development and serve democracy.\r\nThe third world faces many constraints. The\r\napplication of the widely advocated concept of good\r\ngovernance with less emphasis on traditional donor\r\nassistance is not impartial: it is very flexible and indulgent\r\nwhen it comes to countries with strategic raw materials, but\r\nstrict and restrictive when it comes to others.\r\nDocility or passivity is often highly regarded;\r\nexpressing criticism puts you in the category of naughty\r\nstudent. The perverse effects of economic embargoes harm\r\nthe innocent civilian population more than those they are\r\nintended to punish. By contrast, a firm approach should be\r\nthe rule in the case of arms embargoes.\r\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, the\r\nUnited Nations finds itself at a new crossroads. It is clear\r\nthat changes must be introduced in our Organization, which\r\nwas conceived 50 years ago in a totally different political\r\nand economic context.\r\nOur determination to work to that end will be the best\r\nresponse both to the anxieties of the developing world,\r\nwhich has doubts about the solidity of the North’s\r\ncommitment to contribute to solving the problem of\r\ndevelopment, and to the demands of public opinion in the\r\ndeveloped countries, which is concerned to see development\r\nassistance put to proper use. Consensus on the steps to be\r\ntaken would restore confidence in the future of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAllow me to express my great pleasure at seeing all of\r\nyou here at this session of the General Assembly to which\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, has so kindly invited us. I pay tribute to his\r\ncompetence, his devotion and his keen sense of\r\nresponsibility. I thank him for the remarkably successful\r\norganization of this Special Meeting.\r\nI am also pleased to congratulate the City of New\r\nYork and its Mayor, Mr. Giuliani, and his team for the\r\nsuccess of our stay in the “Big Apple” of New York.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to the President of\r\nthe United States of America for his benevolent support\r\nfor the convening of this commemoration of the United\r\nNations fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Madagascar for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Albert Zafy, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Punsalmaagiin\r\nOchirbat, President of Mongolia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat,\r\nPresident of Mongolia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat,\r\nPresident of Mongolia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Ochirbat (spoke in Mongolian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): The United Nations,\r\nhaving risen from the ashes of the most devastating war\r\nin the history of humankind, is today celebrating its\r\ngolden anniversary with a renewed sense of purpose and\r\nconfidence in the future.\r\nFrom a distance of 50 years one could reasonably\r\nargue that there were no victors or vanquished in that war\r\nand that the sole winner was the entire human race. But\r\nthe 50 million who perished in it will always be a stark\r\nreminder of the imperative still fundamental today,\r\nnamely, perseverance in our collective efforts to achieve\r\npeace, progress and social justice. I say this in the name\r\nof a country that stood by the Allied forces and did all it\r\ncould to facilitate the victory over fascism and militarism.\r\nThe second half of this century will go down in the\r\nannals of history as a time of great victories of human\r\ngenius, of the triumphant struggles of peoples for\r\nfreedom, independence and democracy, of a dawning\r\nrealization of the humanistic ideals of equity, justice and\r\nhuman rights. In all these truly revolutionizing processes\r\nthe part played by the United Nations has indeed been\r\ninstrumental.\r\nThis half century will also be remembered as a time\r\nof tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for\r\npurposes of destruction, a time of rising disparities\r\nbetween nations, of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nresources and, above all, of unprecedented loss of human\r\nlives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities\r\nopened up by revolutions in science and technology. This\r\nturbulent world of glaring contrasts, having moved beyond\r\nthe cold war, has now entered a new stage of rapid changes\r\nin its development.\r\nChallenging as it may be, history is offering us a\r\nunique opportunity for a genuine realization of the lofty\r\nobjectives and ideals conceived by the founders of the\r\nUnited Nations. This calls insistently for a bold reform of\r\nthe Organization. It goes without saying that the underlying\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nshould constitute the foundation of any and all change. The\r\nreform process should embrace the entire United Nations\r\nsystem. Democratization, transparency, accountability, and\r\ndue consideration of the positions of all should be at the\r\nheart of reform. Reform especially concerns the Security\r\nCouncil. In our view, this soul-searching undertaking should\r\nlead us to an Organization that is more sensitive to and\r\nprotective of the needs and interests of the smaller and\r\nweaker majority.\r\nThe United Nations is all too often criticized and\r\nblamed for every ill and wrong. But it is all too often\r\nforgotten that the effectiveness of our Organization directly\r\ndepends on the political will of its Member States. The\r\nUnited Nations is not only a rostrum for us to express our\r\nthoughts but, as a centre for harmonizing our actions and\r\npositions, it should also provide the model criteria for\r\nconstructive negotiations.\r\nIn our view, it is imperative to make the mechanism\r\nfor the pacific settlement of disputes work. This could\r\ninclude, inter alia, the further development and\r\nimplementation of ground rules that would help ensure that\r\nnegotiations are conducted solely and exclusively on the\r\nbasis of good will and respect for the sovereign and equal\r\nrights of all participants, unimpeded by any actions\r\ndesigned to disrupt them, poison their atmosphere or attain\r\nunilateral concessions through pressure. We believe that this\r\nis an important issue that deserves due consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, may I reaffirm Mongolia’s\r\ndetermination to join with other sister nations in our\r\ncommon endeavour to bequeath to succeeding generations\r\na world that is peaceful, prosperous, pluralist and humane.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of Mongolia for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat,\r\nPresident of Mongolia, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jiang Zemin, President\r\nof the People’s Republic of China\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Jiang Zemin, President of\r\nthe People’s Republic of China.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jiang Zemin, President of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Jiang Zemin (interpretation from\r\nChinese): In a few years’ time mankind will bid farewell\r\nto the twentieth century with all its vicissitudes, and enter\r\nthe twenty-first century, with all its promise. At this\r\nhistoric juncture it is of great significance that we have\r\ngathered here from all corners of the world to\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe founding of the United Nations 50 years ago\r\nwas a major event in the history of international relations.\r\nIt reflected the strong desire of the people of the world to\r\neliminate the scourge of war and mirrored humanity’s\r\ndream for a new world of peace, equality, cooperation\r\nand prosperity.\r\nOver the past 50 years our world has undergone\r\nearth-shaking changes. The struggle for national liberation\r\nand social progress has raged like a prairie fire. Mankind\r\nhas maintained peace for half a century. However, all is\r\nnot tranquil in the world today. The international situation\r\nafter the end of the cold war has, on the whole, moved\r\ntowards relaxation, yet hegemonism and power politics\r\nhave lingered, armed conflicts and local wars have kept\r\ncropping up one after another, and hundreds of millions\r\nof people in the developing world are still struggling with\r\npoverty.\r\nOver the past 50 years the United Nations has done\r\nmuch useful work in mitigating regional conflicts,\r\neradicating colonialism, expediting arms reduction and\r\npromoting peace and development in the world. However,\r\nit also has its failures and setbacks. Certain big Powers\r\nhave tended to use the Organization as a signboard under\r\nwhich to advance their own political interests, and their\r\nrivalry has often left the United Nations in limbo.\r\nMoreover, the rights and interests of the large number of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\ndeveloping countries have not been fully respected for a\r\nlong time.\r\nOur experience and lessons over the past half century,\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter and the epochal\r\nthemes of peace and development have all placed solemn\r\nand urgent demands on us.\r\nWe must create a secure and reliable international\r\nenvironment of lasting peace and stability. Disputes\r\nbetween States should be resolved through peaceful\r\nnegotiations and consultations instead of resorting to the use\r\nor threat of force. Efforts should be made to stem and\r\nremove various factors that might lead to war, with a view\r\nto safeguarding the security of all countries and regions in\r\nthe world.\r\nWe must uphold the norms governing international\r\nrelations, with the principles of sovereign equality and non-\r\ninterference in each other’s internal affairs as the core.\r\nThese principles established by the founders of the United\r\nNations in the Charter 50 years ago have greater vitality\r\nand are of realistic significance today. All sovereign States\r\nare equal members of the international community. It is\r\ntime that we wrote a new chapter in the annals of\r\ninternational relations in which the phenomena of the big\r\nbullying the small, the strong lording it over the weak and\r\nthe rich oppressing the poor are removed completely from\r\nthe face of the Earth.\r\nWe must establish a new type of international\r\neconomic relations featuring mutual benefit, mutual\r\ncomplementarity and common development. The\r\ninternationalization of economic life requires that all\r\ncountries conduct extensive economic exchanges and\r\ncooperation. The developed countries should help the\r\ndeveloping countries to revitalize their economies, which\r\nalso serves the long-term interests of the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nWe should bring about a situation of international\r\nharmony which allows countries to make independent\r\nchoices and seek common ground while putting aside\r\ndifferences. It is within the sovereignty of every nation to\r\nopt, in keeping with its own reality and the will of its\r\npeople, for a social system and road of development of its\r\nown choice. No one else has the right to interfere with it.\r\nIt is only by respecting one another seeking common\r\nground while putting aside differences, living with one\r\nanother in amity and complementing one another that we\r\ncan make the world as colourful as a garden where a\r\nhundred flowers compete for the beauty prize.\r\nWe must join hands in meeting the challenges to\r\nhuman survival and development. We all share one and\r\nthe same planet. The solution to such global issues as\r\necological degradation and population explosion requires\r\nnot only efforts at the national level but also close\r\ncoordination and cooperation at the international level.\r\nIt is our view that the foregoing points should be\r\nincorporated in the new international political and\r\neconomic order whose establishment has been eagerly\r\ndesired by the people of all countries. The United Nations\r\nshould and can play its important and unique role in this\r\nregard. It can be said that the realization of such a new\r\ninternational political and economic order is the main\r\nhallmark of the better world we are to build together.\r\nLoving peace and desiring development, the Chinese\r\npeople are willing to cultivate friendly relations and\r\ncooperation with the people of the rest of the world and\r\nsteadfastly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace.\r\nEven when China becomes stronger and developed it will\r\nnot seek hegemony or pose a threat to anyone. On the\r\ncontrary, China, as an important force for the maintenance\r\nof world peace and stability will make an even greater\r\ncontribution to mankind.\r\nThere is only one China in the world and Taiwan is\r\nan inalienable part of Chinese territory. The Government\r\nof the People’s Republic of China is China’s sole legal\r\nGovernment and its sole representative in the United\r\nNations. The Chinese people have the ability, the\r\nresourcefulness and the confidence to overcome any\r\ninterference in putting an end to the division between the\r\ntwo sides of the Taiwan Straits and achieve the\r\nreunification of the motherland.\r\nBeing a founding Member of the United Nations and\r\none of the permanent members of the Security Council,\r\nChina has always abided by the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter and conscientiously fulfilled its\r\ninternational responsibilities and obligations. We believe\r\nthat the United Nations should adopt necessary and\r\nappropriate reforms in the spirit of fairness,\r\nreasonableness and full consultation.\r\nThe political leaders of our generation have on their\r\nshoulders the historic mission of carrying forward the\r\ncause of world peace, development and progress into the\r\nfuture. In looking forward to the new century, let us join\r\nhands and work together for a still better world.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jiang Zemin, President of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Prince Rainier III,\r\nHead of State of the Principality of Monaco\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Serene Highness Prince Rainier, Head of\r\nState of the Principality of Monaco.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Rainier III, Head of State\r\nof the Principality of Monaco, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPrince Rainier (interpretation from French): The\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, which takes a modest seat among\r\nthe concert of nations, is honoured to be able to join in this\r\nsolemn tribute paid by the General Assembly in devoting\r\nthis Special Meeting to commemorating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\r\nThe terrible images of the Second World War, of\r\nhorrible combats, of massive destruction, of endless\r\nsuffering inflicted on innocent civilians and on combatants,\r\nremind us of the kind of events and dangers that brought\r\nthe representatives of 51 allied countries to San Francisco\r\nto sign, on 26 June 1945, the Charter that established the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWhile the balance of military force and diplomacy has\r\nsince that memorable date spared mankind a further world\r\nconflagration, many countries have suffered from armed\r\nconflict. We still see too often the tragic picture of civilians\r\nfleeing the fighting and taking the road of exodus to\r\nuncertain destinations; we see families, women and old\r\npeople completely abandoned.\r\nIn all circumstances, the United Nations has done its\r\nutmost, with the authority and means available to it, to help\r\npromote a return to peace, to protect the peoples exposed\r\nto danger and to ease the suffering of victims.\r\nExperience has shown that the needs which gave rise\r\nto the San Francisco Charter are with us today.\r\nApart from the conflicts that I have just mentioned, in\r\nthe past 50 years the world has also undergone other\r\nupheavals which political leaders have to take into\r\naccount in their day-to-day activities and in their decisions.\r\nFocusing only on the essentials, I shall speak about\r\nthe population explosion throughout the world and the\r\nserious attacks on nature and the environment by\r\nurbanization and industrialization; the major advances by\r\nscience and technology, which have often benefited man\r\nbut have sometimes also brought new threats to his life or\r\nhealth; the appearance of scourges, such as drugs and\r\nAIDS; and blind terrorism of various kinds and authors.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies are\r\ndoing their utmost to bring about the exchange of\r\nknowledge, and cooperation and agreement, the only way\r\nto enable people and nations to move along the road to\r\npeace and sustainable prosperity. That is the major\r\nchallenge facing us at the end of the second millennium.\r\nAs a Member of the United Nations the Principality\r\nof Monaco has adhered to the purposes and principles\r\nenshrined in the San Francisco Charter. For the time\r\nbeing, my country has no other ambition than to live up\r\nto the commitments it has entered into under the Charter\r\nand to implement the decisions taken on the basis of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMonaco is regularly involved financially in the work\r\nbeing undertaken on behalf of children, refugees, victims\r\nof torture, and disabled persons — indeed the\r\nhumanitarian work of the Organization. Our Principality\r\nis always willing to participate in initiatives to strengthen\r\nthe protection of unarmed civilian populations during\r\ntimes of conflict.\r\nThe Principality is a seagoing country and is\r\nparticularly active, and intends to continue being active,\r\nin the sphere of protection of the seas and oceans, and,\r\nbeyond that, nature in general.\r\nMonaco remains faithful to the recommendations\r\nadopted at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit and is\r\nstriving to implement them. We now know that natural\r\nresources are not inexhaustible. Only by using them in\r\nmoderation can we ensure peace and well-being for future\r\ngenerations.\r\nI cannot end my statement without paying well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the current and former officials and\r\nstaff of the United Nations — first among them, of\r\ncourse, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his\r\npredecessors — for their devotion and self-sacrifice,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nsometimes at the peril of their lives, in the service of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nMay the experience of the last 50 years encourage us\r\nto persevere in our efforts so that the world can take even\r\ngreater inspiration from the ideals that led the way in the\r\nfounding of the United Nations.\r\nPeace is not merely the absence of war. It is, above\r\nall, a vocation residing within each one of us, and when its\r\nseeds are spread, peace can take root and flourish\r\neverywhere and for everyone.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe Head of State of the Principality of Monaco for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Rainier III, Head of State\r\nof the Principality of Monaco, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Cheddi Jagan, President\r\nof the Cooperative Republic of Guyana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Cheddi Jagan, President of\r\nthe Cooperative Republic of Guyana.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Cheddi Jagan, President of the\r\nCooperative Republic of Guyana, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Jagan: As the United Nations proudly\r\ncelebrates its fiftieth anniversary, I wish to join the other\r\nMembers of our international family in paying tribute to the\r\nOrganization which has served us so well over these many\r\nyears.\r\nAs so many others before me have testified, the\r\naccomplishments of the United Nations during its 50 years\r\nof existence have been many and significant. With the\r\nending of the cold war, there is now a promise of even\r\ngreater achievements.\r\nYet, although now free from the tensions of East-West\r\nrivalry, we are still hostage to many threats to our peace\r\nand security. This crucial time is characterized by, first,\r\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy,\r\ndominated by transnational corporations and one over-\r\npowering ideology; second, unacceptably high\r\nunemployment and underemployment, even in a period of\r\neconomic growth, referred to as “jobless growth” and\r\n“jobless recovery”; third, increasing poverty and widening\r\ngaps, in developed and developing countries, between the\r\nhaves and the have-nots — the included and the excluded\r\n— and between the rich North and the poor South; fourth,\r\nchronic budget and balance-of-payments deficit problems\r\nfor many Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) countries, leading to the\r\ndismantling of the welfare State and cuts in welfare\r\nbenefits in the North, as well as cuts in aid to the South\r\n— the phenomenon now termed “donor fatigue” or “aid\r\nfatigue”; fifth, social, including family, disintegration;\r\nsixth, strife and conflicts based on race, ethnicity, tribe,\r\nculture and religion, leading to a marked increase in\r\nrefugees; and, seventh, demagogy and confusion, leading\r\npolitically, to the dangerous rise of the extreme right, the\r\nreligious right, national chauvinists, xenophobists and\r\nneofacists and, socially, to racism and racist attacks.\r\nCumulatively, these factors pose a grave threat to\r\ninternational and individual peace and security.\r\nConsequently, there is an urgent necessity for a new\r\nglobal human order as an adjunct to the United Nations\r\nAgenda for Development. A new global human order\r\nmust have as its goal human development, which means\r\nmeeting the basic needs of the people, attaining cultural\r\nuplift and providing a clean and safe environment.\r\nTo attain a new global human order, it is necessary\r\nto establish a sound and just system of global governance\r\nbased on a genuine North-South partnership and\r\ninterdependence for mutual benefit; a democratic culture\r\nof representative, consultative and participatory\r\ndemocracy and a lean and clean administration; a\r\ndevelopment strategy free from external domination and\r\ndiktat; the application of science and technology for\r\nincreased production and productivity; a global\r\ndevelopment facility, funded by pollution taxes, cuts in\r\nmilitary expenditure — the peace dividend — a mere 3\r\nper cent reduction of which could realize $460 billion in\r\nthe five-year period from 1995-2000, and a tax of 0.5 per\r\ncent on speculative capital-exchange movements, which\r\ncould yield $1,500 billion annually; and the administration\r\nof a development fund by a democratized and reformed\r\nUnited Nations for allocation without undue conditions to\r\nthe developed and developing countries alike — with\r\nsuch assistance, more job opportunities could be created\r\nby a works programme, as was done under the Roosevelt\r\nNew Deal Administration during the Depression of the\r\n1930s, and we could have a shorter work week and a\r\nlower pensionable age, while for the developing countries,\r\naid could be given in the form of debt cancellation, long-\r\nterm rescheduling of debt, soft loans and grants.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThird-world debt is strangling our reconstruction and\r\nhuman development efforts. Although we paid more than\r\n$1.3 trillion between 1982 and 1990, our countries were 61\r\nper cent deeper in debt in 1990 than they were in 1982.\r\nDuring the same period there was a net South-to-North\r\noutflow of $418 billion — not including outflows such as\r\nroyalties, dividends, repatriated profits, underpaid raw\r\nmaterials and so on — a sum equal to six Marshall Plans,\r\nthe Plan which provided aid to Europe at the end of the\r\nSecond World War. At the same time, our third-world\r\ncountries lose about $500 billion annually in unfair non-\r\nequivalent international trade, a sum equal to 10 times the\r\nofficial development assistance from the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThis unjust economic order must be replaced by a just\r\nnew global human order for international and individual\r\nsecurity and peace. The human development paradigm must\r\nbe established on a basis of empowerment of our peoples,\r\naccountability, productivity and sustainability. Economic\r\ngrowth must be linked to equity, with social justice and\r\necological preservation.\r\nLet us together resolve, on this historic occasion, to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations, which was created not only\r\nto preserve us from the scourge of war but also to allow\r\nour peoples to live in larger freedom. Let us move forward\r\nin unity with a new global human order.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nCooperative Republic of Guyana for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Cheddi Jagan, President of the\r\nCooperative Republic of Guyana, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Alija Izetbegovič,\r\nPresident of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Alija Izetbegovič, President\r\nof the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alija Izetbegovič, President of the\r\nPresidency of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Izetbegovič: The United Nations, whose\r\nanniversary we celebrate today, has always been a source\r\nof our hope, but also a constant cause of our\r\ndisappointment. Some say that it is the largest, but, on\r\noccasions, the most inefficient body in human history.\r\nThe number of unimplemented resolutions is proof of\r\nthis. Being as it is, our Organization probably reflects the\r\nimperfection of our world. If the continuous improvement\r\nof the world is not work in vain, the further improvement\r\nof the United Nations is not only possible, but very\r\nnecessary.\r\nThe supreme goal is the maintenance of peace. The\r\nUnited Nations has succeeded in the prevention of global\r\nconflict, but it has proved less effective in stopping local\r\nones. The sum of the catastrophic consequences in local\r\nwars from the founding of the United Nations until today\r\nhas reached a tragic balance with the world wars of this\r\ncentury.\r\nThe United Nations acted effectively in stopping the\r\nGulf crisis. Unfortunately, this efficacy has not repeated\r\nitself in the case of the aggression against my country.\r\nThe price of hesitation has been enormous. My people\r\nhave paid this high price.\r\nI would like to repeat the words of the Georgian\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, who at this rostrum two\r\ndays ago stated:\r\n“We must have the courage and the will to\r\ncall an aggressor an aggressor, and genocide\r\ngenocide.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n36th meeting, p. 29)\r\nAs the Assembly knows, very often, there has been a lack\r\nof either courage or will, or sometimes both.\r\nIn several days the talks on peace in Bosnia will\r\ncommence. We approach this initiative, undertaken by the\r\nUnited States and its President, with the best of faith and\r\nwith plenty of hope. Our people need and want peace. We\r\ndid not start this war, and, although we are enduring, we\r\nhave not dreamed of being victors in war. We have\r\nalways worked towards peace and we would like to be\r\nvictors in peace. We want to strengthen a society based\r\non political and ethnic pluralism, respect for human rights\r\nand private enterprise. Since, on the other side, everything\r\nis opposite to this, we are confident that our ideas will\r\ntriumph in a peaceful concurrence in the next five to 10\r\nyears. Thanks to the superiority of our models of society\r\nand State, we shall win, with God’s help.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThe Bosnian Government and Army will not accept\r\nthe division and disintegration of our country, no matter in\r\nwhat packaging it may be served. The division of Bosnia\r\nwill lead to the continuation of war, immediately or later.\r\nGenuine democratic elections in Bosnia are a big\r\nchance — if not the only real chance — to remove from\r\nthe commanding political and military functions the war\r\ncriminals and nationalist fanatics who caused this war and\r\nwho will continue to poison the relations between people\r\nand nations. In order for this chance for democracy in the\r\nBalkans not to be wasted, it is necessary to ensure certain\r\nconditions. These conditions are freedom and effective\r\ninternational supervision of elections.\r\nIf the peace negotiations are concluded successfully,\r\nthe reconstruction of the war-stricken areas will follow, in\r\nparticular in Bosnia. The international community is\r\npromising significant support for the reconstruction plan. In\r\nthis connection, I would make one, maybe unexpected,\r\nproposal: put conditions on this assistance. Send a clear\r\nmessage that the party which will not respect freedoms and\r\nhuman rights will not receive assistance. And decide that\r\nthese conditions should be strictly observed. Do not make\r\nmistakes again, in the hope that you can buy or change the\r\ncriminals and tyrants by new concessions. And take one\r\nstep further. Isolate the criminals and tyrants. That is the\r\nonly way.\r\nThose who have led their people to the path of crime\r\nmust be removed. Without this there is no peace or\r\nsecurity, neither in Bosnia, nor in the region.\r\nWe want and have the right to integrate Bosnia, which\r\nhas been destroyed, not through the will of its people, but\r\nthrough the force of weapons. The Bosniak-Croat\r\nFederation is an important step in this direction, and all\r\nfriends of Bosnia should support and assist this project.\r\nIn order to achieve peace, and — what is more — to\r\nmaintain it, it is necessary to establish a balance in\r\nweaponry. This balance can be established on a higher or\r\nlower level. We give preference to the latter, and we\r\ndemand the reduction of Serbian heavy weaponry. If the\r\nSerbs reject this, the only option is to arm the Bosnian\r\nArmy, which, so strengthened, will become a factor of\r\npeace and stability in the region.\r\nAt present, almost all of our cities are within the reach\r\nof Serbian artillery. This artillery must be removed or\r\ndestroyed. We cannot and we will not agree to continue to\r\nlive under permanent threat.\r\nFinally, in the past two days many speeches have\r\nbeen delivered in this Hall. We have heard nice and lofty\r\nwords on democracy and freedom and all that comes with\r\nthem. Freedom and justice have been recalled by some of\r\nthose who have stridden and continue to stride over the\r\nbasic rights of people and nations.\r\nOne of the ancient holy scriptures says “Judge them\r\naccording to their deeds”. Therefore, let us listen to what\r\nthey are saying, but let us see what they are doing. As\r\nsoon as they return home, they will continue their\r\nunrepentant course — of course, if we continue to tolerate\r\nit.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nPresidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alija Izetbegovič, President of\r\nthe Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Wilton S. Sankawulo,\r\nChairman of the Council of State of the Liberian\r\nNational Transitional Government of the Republic of\r\nLiberia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Wilton Sankawulo,\r\nChairman of the Council of State of the Liberian National\r\nTransitional Government of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wilton S. Sankawulo, Chairman\r\nof the Council of State of the Liberian National\r\nTransitional Government of the Republic of Liberia,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nChairman Sankawulo: On the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations,\r\nI am greatly honoured and most gratified to have an\r\nopportunity to address this august body.\r\nHalf a century ago men of optimism who envisioned\r\na world of peaceful coexistence among nations founded\r\nthe United Nations. They saw the necessity of instituting\r\nmeasures for the prevention and the removal of threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. They wanted to\r\nencourage friendly relations between States based on the\r\nprinciples of sovereignty, equality and improving the\r\nquality of life for all peoples by fostering economic,\r\nsocial and cultural cooperation throughout the world.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThis historic development was prompted by the\r\nhorrifying experience of two world wars — devastation that\r\nthreatened the annihilation of life on Earth in all its forms.\r\nAdditionally, the rapidity with which new weapons of mass\r\ndestruction were being introduced in the theatre of war\r\naroused the urgent need to set up a permanent mechanism\r\nto regulate international relations. The founders of the\r\nUnited Nations also saw the need for defining and\r\ncodifying rules of conduct for the prevention, management\r\nand peaceful resolution of disputes between nations.\r\nIf the spectre of war prevails in most of the countries\r\nthat attained independence after the birth of the United\r\nNations, it is due largely to the legacy of colonialism, the\r\ncold war and the pains that often characterize the new birth\r\nof freedom. Colonial powers disregarded the traditional\r\nvalues and social needs of their subjects. The contest for\r\nspheres of influence during the cold war gave rise to\r\nautocratic regimes, which were insensitive to the aspirations\r\nof their peoples. These new democracies must go through\r\ngrowing pains before acquiring maturity. Thus the signing\r\nof the United Nations Charter 50 years ago in San\r\nFrancisco by 51 States, including my country — Liberia —\r\nwas a significant milestone in the creation of a global\r\narrangement for securing human liberty, as well as\r\nmaintaining international peace and progress.\r\nThis Charter embodies the aspirations of all mankind.\r\nBelieving in the principles for which it stands, including\r\nthat of universality, many countries joined the Organization.\r\nToday, its membership stands at 185 States. By providing\r\na forum for a frank exchange of views on international\r\nissues, the United Nations draws together nations of diverse\r\nideological orientations to tackle their common problems.\r\nA beacon of hope for mankind, the United Nations\r\nvigorously fought colonialism and racial discrimination,\r\nstrongly advocating the right of all members of society to\r\nlive a free, secure and fulfilling life. In order to safeguard\r\nthis right, the United Nations established a number of\r\nspecialized agencies to combat the perennial enemies of\r\nmankind: ignorance, disease and poverty. We can say with\r\npride and satisfaction that the United Nations has won for\r\nitself enviable records of success in these endeavours. Most\r\ncolonized nations have received their independence; the\r\nobnoxious system of apartheid has crumbled; the quality of\r\nlife has vastly improved in many countries.\r\nHowever, the United Nations cannot afford to rest on\r\nits laurels, for its successes are overshadowed by conflicts\r\nin many parts of the world. A steadily widening prosperity\r\ngap and inequities strain relations between the developed\r\nand the developing countries. We hope that the nations of\r\nthe world, especially those enjoying economic affluence,\r\nwill take positive steps in the near future to establish a\r\nnew economic order that will improve the quality of life\r\nfor all peoples. To do less would be an act of non-\r\ncompliance with the Charter’s mandate to forge\r\ninternational machinery to promote the economic and\r\nsocial advancement of all nations.\r\nAs peace and development are inextricably linked,\r\nLiberia welcomes the two expositions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, entitled “An Agenda\r\nfor Peace” and “An Agenda for Development”. Both\r\ndocuments provide a framework in which we can\r\nimplement the principles contained in the United Nations\r\nCharter as it relates to the new realities of the post-cold-\r\nwar era.\r\nLiberia lends its voice to the call for restructuring of\r\nthe United Nations. This vital institution must continue\r\nevolving and growing in an enlightened fashion, but\r\nalways within the limits of the principles enshrined in its\r\nCharter.\r\nI want to utilize this forum to inform the Assembly\r\nthat, after almost six years of bitter civil war, Liberians\r\nare more hopeful than ever before that peace is finally at\r\nhand. This achievement is due largely to the intervention\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), which is currently under the dynamic\r\nleadership of President Jerry John Rawlings of Ghana.\r\nLiberians will for ever remain grateful to our West\r\nAfrican brothers for providing and maintaining a peace-\r\nkeeping force in their country for the security of the\r\npeople. This, indeed, is an example of genuine African\r\nsolidarity.\r\nWe also extend our deepest appreciation to the\r\nUnited Nations, its specialized agencies, the United States\r\nand the international community for the assistance they\r\nhave rendered throughout our conflict. Now that we have\r\ncome to a crucial point in our search for peace, we appeal\r\nto States Members of the United Nations to render us the\r\nassistance needed to bring this conflict to an end by\r\nproviding the requisite support for the disarmament and\r\ndemobilization of fighters and the repatriation of our\r\npeople who are currently languishing in refugee camps\r\nabroad. We are assured of peace because the present\r\nCouncil of State comprises all factional leaders, who have\r\nturned territories under their control over to the Cease-fire\r\nMonitoring Group of ECOWAS (ECOMOG) for the\r\nimmediate disarmament of all their fighters.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nAs the Liberian Government and people begin\r\nfulfilling the sacred mandate of returning the country to\r\ndemocratic rule, we shall need the continuous support of\r\nthe international community, not only for the disarmament\r\nand demobilization of fighters but also for the social and\r\neconomic reconstruction of the nation. We are appealing for\r\nthis support so that Liberia — a founding Member of the\r\nUnited Nations — may regain its standing in the comity of\r\nnations. It is our fervent hope that all States Members of\r\nthe United Nations will make substantial contributions to\r\nthe Pledging Conference on Liberia to be conducted by\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, President\r\nRawlings of Ghana and myself this Friday for the\r\ngeneration of funds to implement programmes that will put\r\nLiberia back on its feet.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, it is worth noting that, despite its setbacks and\r\nshortcomings, this Organization remains the world’s\r\nprincipal mechanism for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and for mobilizing collective efforts to deal with\r\nglobal problems.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, we must\r\nbuild a new global order that can fulfil the yearnings of the\r\nhuman family for peace, social justice and progress. Liberia\r\nreaffirms its abiding faith in and its commitment to the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nMay God save this all-important Organization as it\r\nendeavours to bring peace and prosperity to mankind.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the Council\r\nof State of the Liberian National Transitional Government\r\nof the Republic of Liberia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wilton S. Sankawulo, Chairman of\r\nthe Council of State of the Liberian National\r\nTransitional Government of the Republic of Liberia,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Kuniwo Nakamura,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Kuniwo Nakamura,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kuniwo Nakamura, President of\r\nthe Republic of Palau, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Nakamura: It is a great honour and\r\npleasure to address this historic gathering and to have the\r\nunique privilege of hearing the profound reflections of the\r\nworld’s leaders on the institution of the United Nations\r\nand the status of our world.\r\nMr. Berisha (President of Albania), Vice-President\r\nof the General Assembly, took the Chair.\r\nWe are in a period of unprecedented change and\r\nopportunity. I refer not only to the remarkable geopolitical\r\nevents of this decade but also to the accelerating scientific\r\ndevelopments changing our world every day. Technical\r\nadvances, particularly in the fields of telecommunications,\r\ncomputers and material sciences, seem almost miraculous\r\nand offer an improved quality of life never before thought\r\npossible. They tie our countries, large and small, together\r\nand make us dependent on each other as never before in\r\nthe history of our planet. Money and ideas move instantly\r\nacross borders. We have the ability to properly feed,\r\neducate and provide health care to every human on the\r\nplanet.\r\nOn the other hand, we may be letting these great\r\nopportunities slip away. We in Palau are alarmed at the\r\ncontinued degradation of our environment. Every day\r\nbrings further news of the extinction of species, the\r\nirrevocable loss of whole ecosystems, the irrefutable\r\nevidence of global warming and a host of additional\r\nenvironmental problems. The continued testing of nuclear\r\nweapons not only suggests the spectre of worldwide\r\ndestruction but also poses potential environmental\r\nproblems, particularly when such experiments use the\r\nPacific Ocean as their testing area.\r\nMany of the problems we now face can be traced to\r\nlimited perspective. We may be able to think of, and be\r\nconcerned for, our children or grandchildren, but who can\r\nreally care for, or even imagine, our descendants hundreds\r\nof years in the future? Large-scale conflicts between\r\nnations are often a product of a perspective which focuses\r\non the small differences between groups, and not the\r\nenormous similarities between all people.\r\nThe United Nations represents the most ambitious\r\nand noble attempt humankind has ever made to craft a\r\nlens with which to transcend self-interest as individuals\r\nand as nations. With such a lens we are able to consider\r\nissues from the vantage point of the representatives of our\r\nclose-knit global family who will come here to the United\r\nNations 50 and 100 years from now to celebrate future\r\nanniversaries of this magnificent institution.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThe United Nations was born out of a global\r\nconsciousness shocked by the horrors of the Second World\r\nWar and it is appropriate that much of its energies are\r\nfocused on the prevention of war. However, we must\r\nrecognize that warfare is often a function of economic\r\ndisparity. An effective tool for the prevention of war is\r\ntherefore the creation of economic strength within nations\r\nand the promotion of economic interdependency between\r\nnations. To help prevent conflict, the nations of the world\r\nmust work through the United Nations, the World Bank and\r\nother appropriate bodies to ensure the enhancement of\r\neconomic cooperation between its Members.\r\nAs the newest Member of the United Nations, we also\r\nstrongly support the desires and aspirations of indigenous\r\npeople who are still struggling for their basic rights. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations must continue fully to\r\nsupport self-determination and to give hope to people who\r\ndesire freedom and control of their own destiny.\r\nOur planet has been compared to a spaceship flying\r\nthrough the universe. As the President of a maritime nation,\r\nI prefer to think of it as a sailing vessel. When my\r\nancestors sailed from South-East Asia to Palau, they needed\r\ncourage, knowledge and wisdom. As nations, we too will\r\nneed all of these qualities in the coming years. But most of\r\nall, my forebears needed to cooperate for the common good\r\nin order to survive. The United Nations is at the helm of\r\nour planetary ship and we are the captains, navigators and\r\ncrew. We must all learn to sail together if our voyage is to\r\nbe a successful one. May peace, harmony and good will\r\nultimately prevail on our planet.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Palau for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kuniwo Nakamura, President of\r\nthe Republic of Palau, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu,\r\nPresident of the Rwandese Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu,\r\nPresident of the Rwandese Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu, President of\r\nthe Rwandese Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Bizimungu: As we are celebrating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we pay homage\r\nto the founding fathers of this Organization, whose vision\r\nhas charted the way for humanity. The Organization was\r\nfounded in the aftermath of two devastating world wars.\r\nThe purpose was to save mankind from similar\r\ncalamities arising from social injustices by providing\r\nmoral tenets for peoples and nations. Indeed, the United\r\nNations formulated and developed significant basic\r\nprinciples relating to human and fundamental rights, the\r\nequality of nations and peoples, and the promotion of\r\nsocial and economic progress for all humanity. A lot has\r\nbeen achieved. However, the proclamation of those noble\r\nobjectives on the one hand and their implementation on\r\nthe other have, on many occasions, reflected double\r\nstandards.\r\nWhile the Charter stipulated the self-determination\r\nand sovereignty of nations, colonized people have often\r\nhad to resort to armed struggle to restore their freedom.\r\nEven after flag-independence, new nations remain\r\nburdened by the influence of the dominant Powers. If\r\nours were not a sham independence, former colonies\r\nwould no longer be considered areas of influence where\r\nthe strategy of “divide and rule” is still applied and the\r\ntraditional relationship is still that of dominator and\r\ndominated.\r\nLast year’s horrendous genocide in Rwanda, which\r\ncost over a million lives, was the direct consequence of\r\nthe factors that I have mentioned. Before the advent of\r\ncolonialism, Rwanda was already a coherent nation. Our\r\nancestors successfully strived to build a nation and a\r\npeople called Banyarwanda from many kingdoms and\r\npeoples.\r\nFor centuries, Rwanda existed without divisions on\r\nthe basis of ethnic or any other sectarian tendencies.\r\nColonialism introduced racist theories and ideologies and\r\npractised discrimination. The first ethnic massacre\r\nengineered by the authorities in the history of Rwanda\r\noccurred in 1959. Rwanda was still under colonial rule. It\r\nis important to recall that, from the end of the First World\r\nWar until 1962, Rwanda was administered under the\r\ntrusteeship of the League of Nations and subsequently of\r\nthe United Nations. Since that time, Rwanda has had\r\nnationals living in exile as refugees. The plight of those\r\nrefugees, who numbered about 2 million before last year’s\r\ngenocide, received no attention for over three decades.\r\nThe existence of those refugees is vivid testimony of the\r\ndiscriminatory policy that was pursued inside the country.\r\nIn actual fact, the present Government is the first in the\r\nhistory of modern Rwanda that does not prevent its\r\nnationals in exile to return home.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nWere it not for outside interference intended to divide\r\nour compatriots, the Rwandese people, based on moral\r\nprinciples and legal instruments set by the United Nations,\r\nwould easily find solutions to the consequences of genocide\r\nand a path towards national reconciliation. But now, the\r\nplanners and perpetrators of genocide are welcomed in\r\nsome capitals, not only as ordinary, innocent refugees, but\r\nas heroes deserving to lead people. Those same criminals,\r\nencouraged by complacency, plan to carry on genocide and\r\nare being re-armed while at the same time they forbid\r\nrefugees to return home.\r\nNot only is this a violation of international\r\nconventions; it also reflects moral decay. How can the\r\nworld be peaceful when there is no respect for basic\r\nprinciples and when there is no morality? It is in this\r\ncontext that President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya pretends\r\nto serve a good cause by associating with those criminals\r\nand protecting them.\r\nIn economic matters, relations between rich and poor\r\ncountries are also characterized by the domination of the\r\nweak by the strong. One example is that, when negotiating\r\nwith financial partners, underdeveloped countries have no\r\nchoice but to accept projects the way those international\r\nfinancial institutions want them. But when they fail, the\r\nconsequences are not shared — all of them are shifted to\r\nthe poor nations. This is the origin of the debt burden,\r\nwhich has negative effects on development.\r\nMechanisms should be worked out so that the United\r\nNations can deliver on expectations. In particular, there is\r\na need to reform the Security Council to make it more\r\nrepresentative and to strengthen the role of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe future of our Organization, our future, requires us\r\nto strive for unconditional solidarity and more dynamic\r\ncooperation. Mankind should never again witness the\r\nhorrors of genocide that took place in Rwanda and the\r\ncurrent “ethnic cleansing” in the former Yugoslavia must be\r\nbrought to an end. We count on the United Nations to\r\ndirect and support our efforts to create a better world for\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRwandese Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu, President of\r\nthe Rwandese Republic, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Zhelyu Zhelev,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bulgaria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Zhelyu Zhelev,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bulgaria.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Zhelyu Zhelev, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bulgaria, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Zhelev: I would like to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his warm welcome and\r\nthe opportunity to address this most representative\r\ninternational forum on behalf of the Republic of Bulgaria,\r\nwhose people celebrate, together with the whole world,\r\nthe fiftieth birthday of the United Nations.\r\nIts birth was both a promising beginning and a\r\ntriumphant end to a terrible war. In the gigantic clash\r\nbetween democracy and totalitarianism during the Second\r\nWorld War, the democratic forces in Bulgaria preserved\r\ntheir nation’s dignity. Despite the difficult historic\r\ncircumstances, Bulgaria allowed no Bulgarian Jew to be\r\nsent to the death camps and no Bulgarian soldier to fight\r\nagainst the anti-Nazi coalition. What is more, it fought\r\nagainst the Nazis in the winter and spring of 1945.\r\nRegrettably, Bulgaria could only join the United Nations\r\n10 years later, when it had already been entrapped in the\r\nWarsaw Treaty Organization at the cost of its independent\r\npolicy.\r\nWithout the principles laid down in the United\r\nNations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, the 1989 “velvet” revolutions in Eastern Europe\r\nwould hardly have been able to sweep away the\r\ntotalitarian regimes equipped, as they were, with the\r\npowerful tools of demagogy, propaganda and terror. The\r\ntwo documents proclaimed, once and for all, the universal\r\nvalidity of fundamental human rights. They held out the\r\npromise of social progress and a higher standard of living\r\nthrough individual freedom and free enterprise.\r\nModern Bulgaria is gradually resuming its traditional\r\nplace in the European family, developing the full range of\r\nrelations with the countries and bodies of the European\r\nUnion, of which it is an associate member. It is an active\r\npartner of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), working with it for the cause of peace and\r\ninternational security. Briefly, Bulgaria is steering a\r\nsteady course to the West while building bridges to the\r\nEast and the South.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nIn the last 50 years, the south-eastern part of Europe\r\nreproduced on a smaller scale the pattern of international\r\nrelations and even the world contradictions; hence the high\r\nstake in the present effort to resolve the raging and\r\nsmouldering conflicts in former Yugoslavia.\r\nBulgaria has been giving its unwavering support to the\r\ninternational effort to restore peace in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and to build regional security. It has been\r\ndoing so at a high economic and moral cost. We know\r\nfrom experience that the democratic option is the key to the\r\nreconciliation of interests and the rights of various ethnic\r\nand religious groups in a rule of law. We are, therefore,\r\nprepared to participate in building up the democratic\r\ninstitutions and in the material recovery of the embattled\r\nareas in the post-war period.\r\nA long-term strategy for a lasting settlement of\r\nconflicts in south-eastern Europe should be founded in a\r\nmodern communications and transport infrastructure linking\r\nthe Balkan countries with the rest of Europe, north-south\r\nand west-east. There is an urgent need for specific\r\nprogrammes in support of stable regional development. The\r\nday before yesterday, together with the Presidents of other\r\nStates in the region, we made one more effort to pool our\r\nresources, with the help of some international organizations,\r\nto breathe life into the initiatives for the development of\r\nsouth-eastern Europe.\r\nOur historical experience has taught us that unity is\r\nstrength. I would like to assure the Assembly that Bulgaria\r\nwill continue to be a worthy Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Bulgaria for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Zhelyu Zhelev, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bulgaria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jacinto Peynado\r\nGarrigosa, Constitutional Vice-President of the\r\nDominican Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\na statement by His Excellency Mr. Jacinto Peynado\r\nGarrigosa, Constitutional Vice-President of the Dominican\r\nRepublic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa,\r\nConstitutional Vice-President of the Dominican\r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Peynado Garrigosa (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): At this Special Meeting at which we\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of\r\nthe United Nations, we must recognize and congratulate\r\nourselves on, what the United Nations has meant to\r\nhumanity since 1945. Its achievements at the international\r\nlevel, particularly those relating to the maintenance of\r\npeace, have been one of the most precious assets of\r\nmankind throughout this past half century.\r\nWe must also recognize that the ongoing efforts by\r\nthe United Nations to promote human rights and to\r\neliminate injustice have been of overriding importance.\r\nThis Organization has been able to settle armed\r\nconflicts and avoid armed conflicts, has fostered\r\ndemocratic institutions by promoting free and fair\r\nelections, and has raised its voice in defence of the poor,\r\nbringing humanitarian assistance to tens of millions of\r\npeople throughout the world.\r\nIts leadership in efforts to protect the environment is\r\nmoving towards the achievement of consensus on\r\nreversing environmental degradation throughout the world\r\nand in achieving a sustainable way of life as we approach\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nWe must also mention the enormous efforts made by\r\nthe United Nations to eliminate infectious disease and to\r\ncarry out the worldwide child-immunization campaign,\r\nand in the adoption of the Conventions on the Rights of\r\nthe Child and on the protection of women.\r\nBut in this new millennium, which is only five years\r\naway now, our Organization must also face up to the\r\ngreat challenges of a permanently changing world, in\r\nwhich areas of confrontation, discrimination and extreme\r\npoverty remain.\r\nIn the new world situation, peace implies economic\r\nand social well-being, environmental viability and the\r\nprotection of human rights: to think of peace without\r\nthese is virtually impossible. The times require that\r\nGovernments now become involved in thorough change\r\nin their economic and social structures so as to establish\r\nthe basis for sustainable human progress. Economic\r\nmeasures alone, without a reordering of society that\r\nwould enhance the dignity, freedom and self-development\r\nof human beings, can never help in strengthening\r\ndemocracy.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThe alleviation of poverty must be based on policies\r\nthat include integration of the poorer sectors, so that they\r\ncan enjoy the benefits of life in society. Let us then adopt\r\nthe right solutions now to eliminate the causes of poverty,\r\nwhich have such a significant effect on the social fabric of\r\nour peoples. Let all our nations — rich and poor, large or\r\nsmall — seek together a way of achieving a better standard\r\nof living through sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is time to choose those instruments that will enable\r\nus to put into practice our ideas, which have already taken\r\nthe form of conventions, declarations and resolutions by\r\nthis Organization and its specialized agencies. Let us ensure\r\nthat everybody benefits from the general well-being.\r\nThe great majority of Heads of State who have spoken\r\nbefore me have agreed that when the cold war ended, new\r\npriorities emerged for all the nations of the world. If we\r\nadd to this reality the fact that the globalization process\r\noften requires additional sacrifices, we must conclude that\r\nthe pressures on nations, particularly the smaller ones, will\r\nincrease in the not far distant future. At that time, the\r\nUnited Nations will have to play an active and decisive role\r\nso as to maintain the social, economic and political balance\r\namong the nations that make it up, with the understanding\r\nthat all have the same rights and obligations now that we\r\nare enjoying a relative peace and that titanic efforts are\r\nunder way to resolve the conflicts that persist.\r\nOur Government, headed by His Excellency Joaquín\r\nBalaguer, and the people that I represent join in celebrating\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, and share the\r\nhope that the Organization’s efforts and successes will\r\ncontinue to increase in the continuing search for a just,\r\nunited, common and fraternal humanity, sharing the\r\nmaterial and spiritual assets of a civilization that can lead\r\nus to see people as part of a common humanity.\r\nWe would urge all Member States to respect the\r\nmandates and the initiatives of this Organization, for only\r\nthrough a true awareness of all the problems facing our\r\ncountries and their possible solutions will we be able to\r\npromote the well-being of the individual.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Constitutional\r\nVice-President of the Dominican Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa,\r\nConstitutional Vice-President of the Dominican\r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Belgium.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Belgium, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Dehaene (interpretation from French): The\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, which we are\r\ncommemorating today, marks the beginning of a new era\r\nfor our Organization. The longstanding divisions of the\r\ncold war have given way to a heightened awareness of\r\nour growing interdependence. The processes of integration\r\nand of regional and international cooperation, the\r\ndevelopment of trade and economic globalization are all\r\npositive phenomena. However, the international\r\ncommunity remains vulnerable to imbalances, crises and\r\nconflicts that affect its various components. Self-interest\r\nas much as generosity therefore oblige the international\r\ncommunity to show solidarity.\r\nThe best instrument for implementing that solidarity\r\nis still the United Nations. This fiftieth anniversary should\r\ntherefore be an opportunity for us to adapt the United\r\nNations to new realities and to equip it to face the\r\nchallenges of the next century.\r\nIt is above all in the social and economic fields that\r\nI see a priority role for the United Nations. The\r\nglobalization of socio-economic activities calls for an\r\nintegrated and universal approach, for if the development\r\nof the world economy is not accompanied by regulations\r\nand corrective mechanisms, it runs the risk of increasing\r\ndestabilization and of breeding social and ecological\r\nimbalances.\r\nOur Organization is the ideal forum in which to\r\naddress these major questions efficiently by stimulating\r\ninteraction among the various institutions and organs of\r\nthe United Nations, which continue to play an important\r\nrole in their respective fields.\r\nI welcome the growing importance that the United\r\nNations attaches to these global challenges. In recent\r\nyears, major conferences on the environment and\r\ndevelopment, human rights, population, social\r\ndevelopment and, very recently, on women have\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nstrengthened our conviction that only a common, united\r\ncommitment can enable us to tackle the major obstacles to\r\ndevelopment successfully.\r\nLet us not lose the momentum generated by these\r\nmajor conferences, and let us give real effect to the\r\nobjectives that they have set, using the United Nations to\r\nchannel the political energy thus created and step by step to\r\ncreate a more just new world order. In that fairer new\r\nworld order, our Organization should give particular\r\nimportance to a concerted campaign to combat terrorism,\r\nthe scourge of drugs, cross-border criminal activity and\r\narms trafficking.\r\nThe United Nations should serve also as the world’s\r\nconscience. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has\r\nserved as the basis and a source of inspiration for the whole\r\nnormative undertaking of the last 50 years in the area of the\r\nprotection and dissemination of human rights.\r\nIn a wider context, the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court would, in our opinion, mark a\r\nnew and important phase, and I hope that this objective will\r\nsoon be achieved. Respect for human rights, combined with\r\ndemocratic social organization, creates conditions\r\nfavourable for development. Without economic and social\r\ndevelopment, peace will always be fragile.\r\nThe United Nations performs a function of primary\r\nimportance in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, whether acting alone or with regional\r\norganizations. The credibility of the United Nations peace\r\noperations can be ensured only if certain conditions are\r\nmet.\r\nThe United Nations should urgently increase its\r\ncapacity for and speed of intervention. One method of\r\ndoing this would be to improve the existing system of\r\nstand-by forces.\r\nThe best contribution of the international community\r\nto peace and security is still, above all, avoiding the\r\noutbreak of conflicts by means of preventive diplomacy.\r\nThere needs to be cooperation to this end among the United\r\nNations, the Member States, regional organizations and\r\nspecialized agencies.\r\nCertainly the United Nations requires reform if it is to\r\nbecome more efficient and more effective. But we must\r\nremain pragmatic and first give it a solid financial base. As\r\na reflection of its Member States, the United Nations can\r\ndo nothing unless we confirm our political commitment and\r\ncomply with our financial obligations. Any unilateral\r\nstance would only aggravate the United Nations crisis.\r\nThe United Nations, as the driving force of\r\ninternational dialogue and mutual understanding, deserves\r\nour respect and our support. It is still the best guide to\r\neconomic and social development, the best instrument for\r\nthe protection and promotion of human rights, and an\r\nassurance against military adventurism. Drawing on our\r\nhalf-century of experience, let us seize this opportunity to\r\ncreate a world in which future generations may find\r\nfulfilment in peace and dignity.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI thank the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium\r\nfor his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Belgium, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Banharn Silpa-Archa,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\na statement by His Excellency Mr. Banharn Silpa-Archa,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Banharn Silpa-Archa, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nMr. Silpa-Archa (spoke in Thai; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Fifty years ago, a tree was\r\nplanted to shelter mankind from war and want. This tree,\r\nthe United Nations, was an expression of faith and hope\r\nthat, through international cooperation, peace would\r\nprevail and people everywhere would enjoy the fruits of\r\nprogress. The dramatic end of the cold war created a\r\nwidespread expectation that peace and prosperity were\r\nfinally within reach. But peace has yet to prevail\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nTo the people of Thailand, peace is not merely an\r\nabsence of hostilities. Peace must be a positive state of\r\nwell-being. It must be peace with freedom and justice,\r\nleading to prosperity. We call it santisukh, which means\r\n“happiness in tranquillity”. To achieve this ideal peace,\r\nThai culture places particular emphasis on tolerance and\r\ncompromise. These virtues have stood the test of time.\r\nThai rulers throughout history have recognized the\r\nimportance of these virtues in fostering social harmony\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nand progress. As a result, tolerance and compromise are\r\ndeeply ingrained in the Thai character, forming the cement\r\nwhich bonds our society together. It is therefore only\r\nnatural that these Thai core values should find resonance in\r\nthe United Nations Charter, which seeks\r\n“to promote social progress and better standards of life\r\nin larger freedom”.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nOver the past few decades, this affinity between Thai\r\nvalues and United Nations goals has been reflected in\r\nSouth-East Asia. In Cambodia, both Thailand and the\r\nUnited Nations played key roles in ending the conflict and,\r\nin effect, in bringing peace to the region. Today, that\r\nformerly war-torn country is on the road to democracy,\r\nwhile its citizens are enjoying new-found security and\r\nfreedom.\r\nPeace is but one crucial facet of santisukh. The other\r\ninvolves the creation of a better life for the people. In this\r\nregard, the record of the United Nations speaks for itself.\r\nThe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP) has worked quietly but effectively to\r\nimprove the lives of millions of Asians. Thanks in no small\r\npart to ESCAP, poverty and disease in the region are\r\nreceding, and more people are taking charge of their own\r\ndestiny.\r\nIn this day and age, where uncertainty lurks at every\r\nturn, and where sustainable development poses a challenge,\r\nthe United Nations is more important than ever. Its role in\r\nSouth-East Asia has shown that, with the right kind of\r\nsupport, it is indeed capable of promoting “happiness in\r\ntranquility”. We should see to it that the Organization\r\nconcentrates on the things which only it can do, or which\r\nit can do better than any other international body: to stop\r\npeople from killing each other, to get people to treat each\r\nother fairly, and to help people live in an environment of\r\ntheir own choosing. These are the most valuable\r\ncontributions that the United Nations can make to mankind.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nThailand, I hereby reaffirm our faith in the principle’s and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter and pledge our full\r\nsupport for the Organization in its efforts to promote lasting\r\npeace and global prosperity.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Thailand for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Banharn Silpa-Archa, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Edison C.\r\nJames, Prime Minister and Minister for External\r\nAffairs, Legal Affairs and Labour of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Honourable Edison C.\r\nJames, Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs,\r\nLegal Affairs and Labour of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Edison C. James,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for External Affairs,\r\nLegal Affairs and Labour of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. James: On behalf of the Government and the\r\npeople of the Commonwealth of Dominica, I extend\r\nsincere congratulations to this body on its fiftieth\r\nanniversary. May I also say that it is a privilege and an\r\nhonour for our country to participate in this special\r\ncelebration. I say “special” because Achievement Fifty in\r\nany endeavour attracts particular attention. For us in the\r\ncricketing world, the number 50 signifies a milestone in\r\nthe cricketer’s record, always met with warm applause; as\r\nindividuals we mark our fiftieth birthday in special ways.\r\nHowever, such occasions provide the opportunity also for\r\nreflection, for self-examination and for self-criticism: for\r\nlooking ahead.\r\nLooking back, one can say that the past 50 years\r\nhave not been the easiest or the most peaceful in the\r\nhistory of mankind. Fifty years ago, the world was slowly\r\nemerging from the batterings and atrocities associated\r\nwith two global conflicts, particularly with the Second\r\nWorld War, that most horrifying experience in the history\r\nof mankind. There was, understandably, scepticism about\r\nthe capacity of any one institution to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. But hope springs\r\neternal in the human breast, and born out of the rubble\r\nwas an ideal, embodied in the United Nations system, that\r\nwar could give way to peace, that the use of measured\r\nwords could replace the use of force in settling disputes.\r\nThe task has not been easy.\r\nToday we celebrate the fact that 50 years ago a\r\ngroup of dedicated men and women, undaunted by what\r\nthey had witnessed, came together to forge an\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\norganization totally dedicated to peace among men. Today\r\nwe salute those nations which, through the United Nations,\r\ncontinue to struggle towards that peace.\r\nAmong the areas of achievement during these past 50\r\nyears can be cited the dismantling of colonialism and the\r\nbirth of the great majority of nations represented here today\r\nin this Assembly. We have seen friendly relations develop\r\namong nations, based on respect for the principle of equal\r\nrights and the self-determination of peoples. We have seen\r\ninternational cooperation in solving international problems\r\nof an economic, social, cultural and humanitarian character.\r\nWe have seen encouragement for the achievement of\r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all,\r\nwithout distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. In\r\nall these endeavours, the United Nations has played a major\r\npart and has been a significant contributor to world peace.\r\nIndeed, today we can all celebrate.\r\nThe successes to which we allude could not have been\r\nachieved without the strong support offered the United\r\nNations by its partners in the perennial search for peace:\r\nthose regional and interregional bodies which serve as the\r\nmonitors and implementers of United Nations policies. As\r\ncurrent chairman of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), I am proud to state on behalf of my\r\ncolleagues, Heads of Government of CARICOM, that our\r\norganization has been one of those partners. A most recent\r\nexample of our commitment to world peace is our mission\r\nof hope to the Haitian people, a well loved part of our\r\nCaribbean family.\r\nThe United Nations has enjoyed other successes to\r\nwhich all can justly claim to have made some contribution.\r\nIn this hemisphere, there is the solving of problems in El\r\nSalvador. Across the Atlantic there is the question of the\r\nindependence of South-West Africa, now Namibia, and\r\nthere is the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa.\r\nWhile the solving of political problems is important,\r\nwe view the present role of the United Nations as one of\r\nactive involvement in the search for an enhanced quality of\r\nlife for the inhabitants of this earth, thus linking peace and\r\nsecurity with economic and social development. In this\r\nregard, the role played by the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), UNICEF,\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations deserve\r\napplause. Efforts at improving the situation of under-\r\nprivileged persons should also receive universal applause.\r\nThe Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing Conferences have\r\nhelped to advance gender equality and give recognition to\r\nthe role of women in the agenda for development.\r\nAs we look to the future with hope, we cannot help\r\nbut reflect with concern on the fact that one of the\r\nfounding Members of the United Nations has now been\r\nrelegated to the status of a non-Member. I refer here to\r\nthe Republic of China. The Commonwealth of Dominica\r\nbelieves that a way can and must be found for the 21\r\nmillion people of that territory to have a voice in the\r\naffairs of the United Nations.\r\nAs we enter the second half-century of the United\r\nNations, there is talk of modernization, revitalization and\r\nrestructuring, concepts every organization must not only\r\nkeep in mind, but must for its own survival actively seek\r\nto apply to its modus operandi. The United Nations\r\nsystem was designed to deal with the problems of the\r\npost-war period, problems mainly related to the disruption\r\nof international peace through recourse to arms. Today’s\r\nthreat to peace has to do primarily with development. We\r\nwould like to believe, therefore, that the cost- cutting\r\nmeasures and streamlining proposed for this restructuring\r\nwill take into account the legitimate aspirations of those\r\nwho people small and vulnerable States such as the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica. We also ask that in the\r\nname of justice for all, powerful and prosperous countries\r\nrefrain from trade and economic measures which will\r\nhave as a result the lowering of the standard of life of\r\nthese small and vulnerable States. Let us always\r\nremember that every human being has a right to be\r\nclothed with dignity, and that at the very heart of the\r\ncosmos stands that same human being, that irreducible\r\nkernel of development.\r\nThe world looks to us for leadership, and much\r\nmore. The Commonwealth of Dominica pledges its\r\nsupport to, and will seek to collaborate with all United\r\nNations efforts to provide this leadership to the world.\r\nGuidance, fairness, justice, peace and security are for\r\nmany still distant ideals. Let us reaffirm our belief in the\r\nprinciples enshrined in our Charter. Let us rededicate\r\nourselves to bequeathing a healthy planet, a peaceful\r\nworld to succeeding generations. We cannot and shall not\r\nlet them down.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for External Affairs, Legal Affairs and Labour of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Dominica for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Edison C. James,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for External Affairs,\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nLegal Affairs and Labour of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime\r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by Her Excellency Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime\r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMrs. Bhutto: Fifty years ago this day, men and\r\nwomen of vision assembled to create an Organization to\r\nsave the world from war.\r\nThe principles of equal rights and self-determination\r\nlay at the heart of that Charter. Millions in Asia, Africa and\r\nLatin America owe their freedom to the pursuit by this\r\nOrganization of these noble ideals. We celebrate this\r\nachievement. For 50 years there has been no global\r\nconflict. We celebrate this great achievement.\r\nWe applaud the United Nations humanitarian and\r\npeace-keeping interventions, to which the brave sons of\r\nPakistan have contributed with their own blood.\r\nWe welcome the United Nations efforts to emphasize\r\nsocial issues, including population, social development,\r\nwomen and human settlements.\r\nThe threat of global conflict has receded, but the\r\nimages of suffering in Kashmir, in Bosnia and other regions\r\nhave saddened us all. And although foreign occupation of\r\nAfghanistan has ended, Pakistan has been left to carry the\r\nburden of one and a half million refugees. The United\r\nNations needs to share this burden and strengthen its efforts\r\nfor peace in Afghanistan.\r\nSo, as we celebrate the achievements of the United\r\nNations, we pause for self-criticism and self-appraisal.\r\nThe Secretary-General has described the Kashmir\r\ndispute as one of the oldest items on the United Nations\r\nagenda. Forty-eight years of occupation have not crushed\r\nthe spirit of a noble people, committed to the right of self-\r\ndetermination, committed to the ideals of the United\r\nNations, placing their hopes on the United Nations pledge\r\nto hold a plebiscite to determine their future.\r\nDo not close your hearts, your minds, to the torment\r\nof Kashmir.\r\nGlobal interdependence is reality. U Thant said, “It\r\nis not starry-eyed idealism”, but our “instinctive sense of\r\nsurvival” that brings us all here. Survival today means a\r\ncommon effort to reduce poverty, hunger and disease, to\r\nsave our environment, to address human needs, to prevent\r\nsocial disintegration and to restore moral values as the\r\nfoundation for the actions of individuals and nations.\r\nSurvival means greater democratization within nations and\r\nwithin the international system.\r\nThe Security Council needs enlargement, but not in\r\nits permanent membership. An Under-Secretary-General\r\nshould be appointed to give greater emphasis to poverty\r\nalleviation. Peace-keeping and conflict resolution\r\nmechanisms need strengthening. I invite Member States\r\nto Islamabad for a conference for this purpose next year.\r\nIt is insufficient for us to denounce atrocities in\r\nRwanda, Bosnia and Kashmir. The perpetrators must be\r\npunished. We should create an international criminal court\r\nfor this purpose. And in the age of the information\r\nhighway, we need to distinguish between the freedom of\r\nexpression, the freedom of action and the freedom to\r\npervert, to pollute and to destroy.\r\nNew challenges face us. Terrorism, the narcotics\r\ntrade and arms smuggling are some of the evils that know\r\nno boundaries. To meet these challenges, we need the\r\nUnited Nations. To meet these challenges, the United\r\nNations needs an independent financial base. For this, a\r\ntax on international financial transactions, on international\r\ntravel, on the exploitation of space or the oceans, can be\r\nconsidered. Today, the responsibility for the future rests\r\non our shoulders. Let us not shirk that responsibility.\r\nLet us remember the words of the philosopher\r\nSpinoza, who said: “Peace is not merely the absence of\r\nwar. It is a virtue that springs from force of character”.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for her statement.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nPercival James Patterson, Prime Minister of Jamaica\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Right Honourable Percival\r\nJames Patterson, Prime Minister of Jamaica.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Percival James\r\nPatterson, Prime Minister of Jamaica, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Patterson: Fifty years ago the United Nations\r\nwas founded to promote international peace and security. Its\r\nmission was to foster cooperation between nations. The\r\neffective functioning of a system of collective security was\r\nimmediately threatened by bitter and intense super-Power\r\nrivalry.\r\nIt is proof of its resilience that the United Nations has\r\nsurvived the cold war and prolonged periods of\r\ninternational tension. It has contributed constructively to\r\nresolving a proliferation of regional conflicts and tackling\r\nother critical problems which imperil international security.\r\nThere are other sterling achievements which are deservedly\r\na source of pride. It has presided over the decolonization\r\nprocess, resulting in profound geopolitical changes. It has\r\nfostered a significant broadening of international\r\nprogrammes, through innovative social and economic\r\nprogrammes, embracing many fields of cooperation. We in\r\nJamaica welcome its latest progeny, the International\r\nSeabed Authority, which enables all nations to exploit\r\npeacefully the resources of the seabed as the common\r\nheritage of mankind.\r\nWe concede that the United Nations is by no means\r\nperfect. Yet we shudder even to contemplate what kind of\r\nworld would have emerged without it. It has become an\r\nindispensable instrument in the search for global dialogue\r\nin the resolution of disputes. It offers the only hope for the\r\nharmonization of global interests and for defusing the\r\ncomplex issues which otherwise can so easily ignite.\r\nWe sometimes forget that the United Nations is the\r\ncreature of its Members. We make it what we will. As\r\nMember States, it is our solemn obligation to build an\r\neffective system which generates lasting peace and social\r\njustice. This will entail revitalization and reform in the\r\nstructure of United Nations organs and the content of their\r\nprogrammes. Reform of the system must reflect the current\r\npolitical realities. It must also be driven by the legitimate\r\nright of all Member States to democratic participation on\r\nthe basis of sovereign equality, no matter what the size,\r\nwealth or power. The right of veto must be reviewed. We\r\nneed a brand new agenda now. It cannot be business as\r\nusual. The traditional approach will not suffice.\r\nOne billion of the world’s population still languish\r\nin extreme poverty. The desperation and frustration in the\r\ndaily struggle for survival by so many often ends in\r\nconflicts, straining the bonds of social cohesion and\r\nresulting in hostile and violent eruptions.\r\nThe eradication of poverty and its attendant evils —\r\nstarvation, malnutrition, homelessness — must engage the\r\npreoccupation of the entire international community.\r\nWherever they occur, these problems cannot be confined\r\nto the place of origin. All of us have a stake in their\r\nsolution. The improvement of the human condition\r\nthroughout the entire planet must be the immediate\r\nobjective of all our efforts. If purely humanitarian\r\nconcerns will not suffice, let us be spurred into action by\r\nthe practical need to avoid incessant turmoil and thereby\r\nmaintain global stability.\r\nTo recognize the linkages is simply not enough.\r\nThere is urgent need for the commitment of resources on\r\na scale commensurate with the immensity of the problem.\r\nWe require a global partnership in which those with the\r\nmeans bear their full share in a global programme to\r\npromote development and thereby spare any human being\r\nanywhere from the scourge of hunger, ignorance and\r\ndisease.\r\nLet not this occasion be just another celebration of\r\ninstitutional endurance but a reaffirmation of our\r\ncollective will to confront the compelling challenges as\r\nwe face the new millennium. Our prospects for the future\r\nare inextricably linked. Let us today renew our pledge to\r\ncreate a world of enduring peace and abundant prosperity\r\nfor every member of the human race.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of\r\nJamaica for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Percival\r\nJames Patterson, Prime Minister of Jamaica, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Defense of the State of Israel\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Defense of the State of Israel.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister of Defense of the State of Israel, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nMr. Rabin: Shalom. This podium has heard many\r\ncries of joy, as well as many words of despair. This podium\r\nhas seen justice, but it has also seen evil, cruelty and\r\nexploitation. In the past 50 years this podium has seen\r\nempires fall, and borders erased. But it has also seen people\r\nawaken to their freedom and the nations of the world\r\ndisplay their flags side by side. It has become possible to\r\nfulfil the words of the prophet Isaiah, a son of the Jewish\r\npeople:\r\n“They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,\r\nand their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not\r\nlift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn\r\nwar any more”.\r\nThis is the dream which I bring to you today from\r\nJerusalem, the eternal capital of the State of Israel and the\r\nheart of the Jewish people.\r\nThis morning I appear before you, the Heads of State\r\nof the international community, as the Prime Minister of the\r\nState of Israel and as the representative of the Jewish\r\npeople. I also stand before you today as a representative of\r\nthose for whom the creation of the United Nations came\r\ntoo late. I come here today in the name of the 6 million\r\nwhose lives were turned into ashes, whose souls ascended\r\nto heaven in burning flames. We will never let them be\r\nforgotten. I stand here as a representative of the children\r\nwho will never smile, in the name of the parents whose\r\nchildren were torn from their arms, of the grandmothers\r\nand grandfathers whose screams fell on deaf ears.\r\nBut we will also never forget our benefactors in this\r\norganization of the United Nations who 48 years ago gave\r\nus a chance for independence. Up to this very day, we still\r\nhear the echoes of the roll-call vote and the two thirds of\r\nthe Member States of the Organization who, on that fateful\r\nevening, voted in support, fulfilling their moral\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThere were also many years when, in this hall, hurtful\r\nand unjust decisions were taken against us. There were\r\nabsurd resolutions which have since been rescinded, such\r\nas the resolution equating Zionism with racism. Many\r\nideologies have failed and faded away. But it is Zionism\r\nthat brought the Jewish people to its historical homeland.\r\nZionism won.\r\nWe are grateful to the international community for its\r\nencouragement at this historic moment which is unfolding\r\non our little plot of land: the agreement between Israel and\r\nthe Palestinians — and I wish to congratulate Chairman\r\nArafat on being our partner in this achievement; the peace\r\ntreaties between Israel and Egypt, and between Israel and\r\nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan; and the significant\r\nchanges in Israel’s relationship with the entire Middle\r\nEast.\r\nThe road is still long. However, we are determined\r\nto continue until we have brought peace to the region, for\r\nour children and our children’s children and for all the\r\npeoples of the region. This is our mission. We will fulfil\r\nit.\r\nJust as we came to you to protest, we now come to\r\npraise the change in the relationship between Israel and\r\nthe international community and the United Nations.\r\nHowever, we cannot be complacent. The United Nations\r\nmust continue to give expression to the new reality in the\r\nMiddle East. We must all be at the forefront of the fight\r\nagainst the forces which threaten peace and security in the\r\nregion for all the countries, for all the peoples of the\r\nregion, and for the entire world.\r\nWe call upon the international community to assist\r\nus in locating our missing in action, and in enabling our\r\nprisoners of war to return to their homes and families.\r\nAs long as children die from hunger, our job here is\r\nnot yet finished. As long as there is no peace in every\r\ncorner of the world, our job here is not yet finished.\r\nThe United Nations must support those who are\r\nworking for peace. It must intensify the international\r\nstruggle against terrorism and its supporters. Terrorism is\r\nthe world’s cancer today. Don’t fool yourselves: even if\r\nyou ignore terror it can enter any of your homes. Terror\r\nmust be defeated. Peace must win. This is a fight that we\r\ncannot afford to lose.\r\nIsrael celebrates here with everyone — with all those\r\nattending here and with the entire world — 50 years of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Defense of the State of Israel for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister of Defense of the State of Israel, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Khamphoui\r\nKeoboualapha, Deputy Prime Minister of the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Khamphoui Keoboualapha, Deputy Prime Minister of\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Khamphoui Keoboualapha, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Keoboualapha (spoke in Lao; interpretation from\r\nFrench text furnished by the delegation): I am honoured to\r\nrepresent my country, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, at this historic commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Laos I would like to begin by\r\nextending our warm greetings to Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, our Secretary-General, to Their Excellencies the\r\nHeads of State and Government, to the heads of delegations\r\nand to the distinguished representatives present on this\r\nsolemn occasion. In particular, I should like to express my\r\nsincere thanks to the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary, chaired by Australia, for its impeccable\r\nperformance. I should also like to thank Mrs. Gillian Martin\r\nSorensen, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General for\r\nPublic Relations, for her outstanding contribution to this\r\nendeavour.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations offers us an unprecedented opportunity for\r\nthe international community to learn from the lessons and\r\nexperience of the past and to use them to make the role of\r\nthe United Nations more effective and to achieve its\r\nultimate goals, namely, the maintenance of peace and socio-\r\neconomic development in the world.\r\nDuring the last five decades, our universal\r\nOrganization has been sorely tried in many conflicts and\r\nupheavals in various parts of the world. Despite the\r\ndifficulties encountered, the United Nations has not only\r\nbeen able to survive, it has also been able considerably to\r\nstrengthen its role in solving world problems. Amongst its\r\nmany activities, there have been many commendable\r\nachievements in the area of decolonization, the\r\nestablishment of the rights of peoples to self-determination\r\nand in the prevention of the threat of a nuclear holocaust.\r\nIts valuable contribution to the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of peoples is well known in the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWhile we welcome what has been achieved, we\r\ncannot but confirm the fact that today’s world is entering\r\na new era — an era of cooperation for development. Yet\r\nthe world is still without true peace. Prospects for the\r\nsettlement of several political conflicts are bleak and\r\nremote. As many delegations have pointed out, to this\r\nmust be added, poverty, disease, war victims, ignorance,\r\nbackwardness and illiteracy, which are endemic in many\r\ncountries and pose a major challenge to all nations. In\r\norder to remedy this state of affairs, it is essential to\r\nrestructure the United Nations so that it can play a more\r\neffective part.\r\nThe realities of the world today show us that true\r\npeace cannot prevail until the imperatives of socio-\r\neconomic development have been adequately addressed.\r\nLikewise, there can be no development without peace.\r\nThe twin concepts of peace and development are therefore\r\nmutually complementary and deserve equal consideration.\r\nAs part of the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations we in the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic organized various events with broad\r\npopular participation in recognition of the Organization’s\r\nassistance and cooperation that has contributed to much\r\nto the socio-economic development of the Lao people.\r\nIt is our hope that this historic commemoration will\r\nbe a spectacular success.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Prime Minster of\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kahmphoui Keoboualapha,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Salem Ould\r\nLekhal, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof Mauritania\r\nThe President: I next call upon His Excellency Mr.\r\nMohamed Salem Ould Lekhal, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Mauritania.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohamed Salem Ould Lekhal,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nMauritania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Ould Lekhal (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nhave the pleasure of reading to you the statement that the\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nPrime Minister of Mauritania, Sidi Mohamed Ould\r\nBoubacar intended to make on this occasion:\r\n“It gives me pleasure to address the Assembly on\r\nthis memorable occasion on behalf of the President of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, His Excellency\r\nMaaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya.\r\n“Allow me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you\r\non your election to preside over this historic session.\r\nOn the occasion of this commemoration my\r\ncongratulations go also to His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, the United Nations Secretary-General,\r\nand to all the departments and specialized agencies of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n“The fiftieth anniversary of our Organization,\r\nwhich we commemorate today, affords the\r\ninternational community an opportunity to reflect on\r\nthe developments that have taken place in the world\r\nsince the United Nations was founded, and to take\r\nstock of the Organization’s successes and failures.\r\n“The 50 years that have elapsed since the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations are long enough\r\nto allow us to look back and to evaluate the work of\r\nthe Organization. The object-lessons we can draw\r\nfrom such evaluation would help us chart our course\r\ntowards the bright future we hope for in line with the\r\nlofty goals of our Organization which was originally\r\ncreated to resolve mankind’s problems on a basis of\r\njustice.\r\n“The United Nations came into being at a\r\nparticularly painful moment in man’s history. The\r\nworld, battered by war, was yearning for peace,\r\nstability and economic reconstruction. There can be no\r\ndoubt that since then the United Nations, through its\r\nspecialized agencies and associated bodies, has\r\nchalked up considerable successes — in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in\r\ndecolonization, in the promotion of human rights and\r\ndemocracy as well as in the sphere of development\r\nassistance and in combating major endemic diseases.\r\n“Here, I take special pleasure in paying a tribute\r\nto the invaluable assistance given Mauritania, along\r\nwith other developing countries, by the United Nations\r\nspecialized agencies, especially the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) in their respective fields.\r\n“Although it is true that the era of bipolar\r\nconfrontation has been superseded by an era of\r\ngreater dialogue for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, and although striking progress\r\nhas been made recently in the world, particularly in\r\nSouth Africa, where apartheid has been dismantled,\r\nand in the Middle East, where peace has begun to\r\nglimmer on the horizon, many countries still\r\ncontinue to live amid the turmoil of armed conflict\r\nand the majority of mankind still suffers from\r\npoverty and underdevelopment.\r\n“The least developed countries, faced as they\r\nare with the effects of the world economic crisis,\r\nwith an inexorable deterioration in terms of trade,\r\nwith a pitiless external-debt burden and with a\r\ndecrease in the volume of international assistance,\r\nare struggling on every front.\r\n“The current crisis and the instability it is\r\ncreating have their origins in the basic structural\r\nimbalances of the international economic system.\r\nThe poverty and destitution of the majority of\r\nmankind are a blot on the world’s conscience and a\r\nthreat to peace and international security.\r\n“These imbalances and inequities must be\r\ntackled through innovative and bold solutions\r\ndesigned to meet the demands and realities of our\r\nshared world. In this connection we note the\r\nrelevance of the pertinent resolutions adopted at the\r\nvarious world summits convened in recent years.\r\n“The theme of today’s commemoration —\r\nWe the peoples of the United Nations ... united for\r\na better world\u0027 — must be more than a slogan. May\r\nthe wisdom and farsightedness of our forebears who\r\nwrote the United Nations Charter in 1945 inspire us\r\nto adopt the conduct and attitudes that will enable us\r\nto avoid the misfortunes and disasters of war and\r\ninsecurity.\r\n“From this rostrum, the Islamic Republic of\r\nMauritania reaffirms its commitment to work to\r\nadvance the great ideals of our Organization, to\r\npromote and consolidate international peace and\r\nsecurity and to strengthen cooperation and solidarity\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\namongst all nations for a world free of war, poverty\r\nand underdevelopment.”\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Mauritania, who read out a\r\nmessage from the Prime Minister.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohamed Salem Ould Lekhal,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nMauritania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Baboucarr-Blaise\r\nIsmaila Jagne, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nGambia\r\nThe President: I now call upon His Excellency Mr.\r\nBaboucarr-Blaise Ismaila Jagne, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Gambia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila Jagne,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the\r\nGambia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Jagne: I have the honour, on behalf of His\r\nExcellency Captain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, Chairman of\r\nthe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council and Head of\r\nState of the Republic of The Gambia, to deliver this\r\nstatement on the auspicious occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe commemoration of the golden jubilee of the\r\nUnited Nations affords us a unique opportunity to review\r\nour past achievements and failures and, more to the point,\r\nto carve out a new path for our world that would be a\r\ncommunity of peoples who need each other for survival. I\r\nrefer, of course, to an interdependent world, a global\r\nvillage, in which the achievement of socio-economic\r\ngrowth, peace and security in one country would depend\r\nlargely on similar performance in other countries. Can the\r\ndeveloping South grow appreciably without the participation\r\nof the industrialized North? Can the North continue to\r\nprosper in the face of poverty and deprivation in the South?\r\nWe in the developing countries of the South need a head\r\nstart, as was given to Europe in the aftermath of the Second\r\nWorld War through the Marshall Plan. There should be no\r\nhalf-way measures.\r\nFifty years after the signing of its Charter the United\r\nNations continues to stand as a universal symbol for\r\nmillions of people all over the world. In our view, the\r\nUnited Nations holds the solution to the quest for world\r\npeace and security, and, in this regard, any country that\r\nfulfils the obligations of membership should be allowed\r\nto take its rightful place in our midst on the basis of the\r\nwidely accepted principle of universality. That is why my\r\ndelegation believes that the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nshould be re-admitted into the United Nations. It should\r\nbe noted that there is a peaceful revolution going on in\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan that promises to make\r\nthe concept of a global village a reality. I refer to the\r\ninformation-technology revolution.\r\nUnlike the United Nations, which has registered 50\r\nyears of existence, our Government has recently\r\ncelebrated a successful year in office. The task of nation-\r\nbuilding has not been made easy by the prevailing harsh\r\neconomic and political climate under which developing\r\ncountries, like ours, have to operate. The Government of\r\nthe Republic of the Gambia remains committed, however,\r\nto the successful implementation of its Programme of\r\nRectification and Timetable for Transition to Democratic\r\nCivilian Rule, as well as the Programme for Socio-\r\nEconomic Development. Every effort is being made to\r\nmeet the targets set. It is disheartening to note, however,\r\nthat our traditional partners in development, rather than\r\njoining hands with us in our efforts to build a new\r\nsociety, are looking for the slightest signs of derailment\r\nof the transition process. In this way, they could sit back\r\nand say, “I told you so!” If we are marching alone,\r\ntherefore, it is because our partners have decided to\r\nmarch out of step.\r\nThe legitimate aspirations of small States will, we\r\nhope, henceforth be given greater attention by the United\r\nNations, bearing in mind that the greatness of a country\r\ndepends not on its size but on the quality of its leadership\r\nand the national character of its people.\r\nIt is our fervent hope, too, that from now on nations\r\nwill not be guided in their relationships by the law of the\r\njungle or the misguided instinct of might being right.\r\nWhat happened to the State of Kuwait five years ago is\r\nstill fresh in our memories. Such aggressive behaviour\r\nmust never happen again to any country, however big or\r\nsmall.\r\nIn our relentless endeavour to promote international\r\npeace and security, there should be more consultation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations. In\r\nour view unilateral decisions are, for the most part,\r\ncounter-productive. A case in point is the dispute between\r\nLibya and some Western countries. We believe that the\r\nposition of the Organization of African Unity on this\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\ndispute offers a reasonable starting point for a resolution of\r\nthe impasse.\r\nThe presence of President Fidel Castro at this\r\ncommemorative event should bring into sharper focus the\r\nthree-decade-long blockade that has been imposed on the\r\nCuban people. We reiterate that it is high time that this\r\nblockade was lifted.\r\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization we should also recognize that the tasks ahead\r\nare startlingly clear, and that we must face them squarely.\r\nThere are some who claim that we have lost our self-\r\nconfidence as a result of the severe and debilitating nature\r\nof the crises confronting the international community in the\r\npost-cold-war era. My delegation believes, however, that,\r\nwhile we must be frank and critical, especially in owning\r\nup to our past shortcomings, we must not lose confidence\r\nor faith in our collective ability to summon the necessary\r\nwill and take the appropriate action in the interests of\r\nmankind.\r\nThere is growing universal consensus on restructuring\r\nthe main organs of the United Nations to reflect current\r\ninternational reality. Fifty years after its founding and its\r\nenlargement to include almost all the countries of the\r\nworld, the United Nations today bears no resemblance to\r\nthe Organization set up after the Second World War to\r\ncater to the needs of that period. The Security Council\r\nespecially, as the main policy-making arm of the United\r\nNations, should be expanded to really take into account the\r\nviews and aspirations of the great majority of the\r\nmembership of the world body.\r\nIt is our sincere wish that, as we are poised on the\r\nthreshold of a new millennium fraught with challenges and\r\nopportunities, we, as Members of the United Nations, will\r\nbe able to stand firm and live up to the confidence reposed\r\nin us by our peoples, the peoples of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Gambia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila Jagne,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Gambia, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Susanna Agnelli,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Italy\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency Mrs.\r\nSusanna Agnelli, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Susanna Agnelli, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Italy, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMrs. Agnelli: Allow me to begin by paying a tribute\r\nto you, Mr. President, and to the Secretary-General for\r\nthe impeccable way in which the Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting has been conducted.\r\nSeventy-five years ago at the end of the First World\r\nWar a few enlightened leaders joined together in pursuit\r\nof the common dream of a lasting peace. But their hopes\r\nwere quickly dashed; some chose almost instantly to\r\nexplore their own distinct path and the dream came to an\r\nend. The result was, two decades later, the outbreak of\r\nthe Second World War.\r\nFifty years ago the world’s leaders turned even more\r\nforcefully to the same dream, and this time succeeded in\r\nuniting all countries and peoples around common ideals\r\nand values. The result has been 50 years without a major\r\nwar.\r\nPreserving peace takes good will, untiring efforts and\r\nconstant support from all United Nations Members. We\r\nshould always remember the words of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) Constitution:\r\n“since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\r\nconstructed.”\r\nThe world has changed in the last 50 years and the\r\nUnited Nations has to change with it. International\r\nconflicts have been replaced by internal ones,\r\ncharacterized by political, economic, ethnic and religious\r\ntensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and\r\nhuman rights violations. We must seek new formulas and\r\ninstruments to face the new crises. Italy is working\r\ntogether with the United Nations to establish a staff\r\ncollege in Turin to train United Nations personnel in\r\nvarious fields.\r\nRespect for international law remains of fundamental\r\nimportance, but international law must also be adapted to\r\nnew situations, as exemplified in the creation of the\r\nInternational Tribunals for former Yugoslavia and\r\nRwanda. Yet ad hoc solutions are not enough. One step\r\nin the right direction would be the establishment of the\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\ninternational criminal court. My country trusts that this\r\ncourt can soon become a reality and has offered to host in\r\nItaly the conference for the adoption of its statute.\r\nA reform of our Organization is clearly needed.\r\nEfforts are already being made in this direction. Italy is\r\ncontributing an original proposal for the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, which would benefit the Organization as\r\na whole and all its Member States by making the Council\r\nmore democratic, more representative, more transparent and\r\nmore accountable to the General Assembly.\r\nIt is often said that there can be no peace without\r\ndevelopment and no development without peace. Ensuring\r\nthe realization of both goals will take serious efforts by all.\r\nDeveloped and developing nations alike must strive to\r\nidentify the priorities and tools needed to bring increased\r\nand more fairly divided prosperity to all the people of the\r\nworld. Italy’s commitment to these ideals is well known. I\r\nwish solemnly to reaffirm it before everyone here today.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Italy for her statement.\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Susanna Agnelli, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Italy, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mario Enrique\r\nVillarroel Lander, President of the International\r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nMario Enrique Villarroel Lander, President of the\r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nSocieties.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mario Enrique Villarroel Lander,\r\nPresident of the International Federation of Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Societies, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Villarroel Lander (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI am honoured and pleased to come to this great forum of\r\nthe United Nations, which is now celebrating its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, bearing greetings on behalf of another\r\nuniversal institution already more than three quarters of a\r\ncentury old, the International Federation of Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies. These greetings that I have the\r\nhonour to convey are backed up by the congratulations and\r\nbest wishes of the 163 member national societies of the\r\nInternational Federation and of the 20 more that are in the\r\nprocess of formation.\r\nBoth the United Nations and our institution were\r\nfounded by idealists who sought to bring works of\r\nenduring peace into the world. In our missions — yours\r\naimed at the construction of a better world with peace,\r\nfull justice and freedom; and ours aimed at the\r\nimprovement of life for the world’s vulnerable people —\r\nhave likewise brought together the world’s States and\r\ntheir peoples.\r\nThe United Nations now has 185 Member States,\r\nand over these crucial 50 years of existence it has, despite\r\nsetbacks and great difficulties, quite clearly functioned\r\nwell and achieved real successes. Our Federation has\r\n128,600,000 members and volunteers and 260,740\r\nemployees, who serve with dedication all over the world.\r\nBoth our organizations are directly and continuously\r\naffected by daily happenings and events of all kinds\r\ninvolving our members. We are both multinational and\r\ncross-cultural in all our ways and customs. Our members\r\nrepresent every religion, culture and ethnic heritage in the\r\nworld.\r\nAs those present well know, the humanitarian\r\nmission carried out by the International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies is that of helping the\r\nmost vulnerable people of the world — the victims of\r\ncatastrophes, poverty and disease, the disadvantaged,\r\nrefugees and displaced persons — by seeking to prevent,\r\ncombat and overcome the things that make them\r\nvulnerable.\r\nIn our work we cooperate effectively with the United\r\nNations, essentially through its specialized bodies and the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs. Partly in recognition\r\nof the work we have accomplished, our past history and\r\nthat significant and generous cooperation, the United\r\nNations granted the International Federation the status of\r\nPermanent Observer in the General Assembly, thereby\r\nenabling us to share with it our views on the difficult\r\nissues affecting humanitarian work around the world\r\ntoday. By way of example, we could mention the\r\ncomplexity of relief operations, often conducted in\r\nfragmented States, and the politicization of humanitarian\r\nassistance, which underscores the need for organizations\r\nsuch as ours to maintain their neutrality and impartiality\r\nat all times.\r\nWe should also point out that minefields remain\r\nafter conflicts are over, killing and maiming for years like\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October 1995\r\nsome unimaginable curse. Sanctions bring undeserved\r\nsuffering on civilian populations. Millions of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons go for decades, sometimes even\r\ngenerations, without knowing a stable existence. Thousands\r\nupon thousands of people cross borders in search of better\r\nliving conditions, sometimes only to find more violations of\r\nhuman rights and more violence than they had fled from.\r\nProblems of population, food, water supply and health loom\r\nmenacingly over the provision of humanitarian needs. And\r\nthe worst thing is that vindictive revenge matches, or at\r\ntimes exceeds, the insane violence of the enemy, which\r\nthen faces its own difficulties in turn. These are some of\r\nthe fundamental issues that the Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nworld will deal with in December, with the States\r\nsignatories of the Geneva Conventions, at the twenty-sixth\r\nInternational Conference of our movement.\r\nNeither can we forget that natural disasters, most of\r\nwhich are unavoidable, continue to take lives, maim people\r\nand impoverish nations, while technological disasters and\r\nthe effects of offences against the environment poison\r\nentire regions, which then require years and vast\r\nexpenditures to recover.\r\nIn this large context, it is imperative that we find ways\r\nto prevent many disasters if we do not wish to resign\r\nourselves to their cyclic recurrence. However, the funds that\r\ndonors now target for fostering development are taking a\r\nsharp downturn. That is why we decidedly share the view\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his August 1995\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. There he points out\r\nthat in order to halt this downward spiral, sustainable\r\nhuman development must be instituted everywhere. A new\r\nvision of development, and the universal determination to\r\nachieve it, are essential for the worldwide progress all\r\npeoples desire and need.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the value and fundamental\r\nnecessity of encouraging and accomplishing sustainable\r\ninstitutional and resource development in order for nations\r\nand peoples to continue to prosper and grow. According to\r\na well-known African saying, child-rearing requires the\r\ninterest and participation of the entire village; in the same\r\nspirit, I would say that the growth and health of all\r\nhumankind require constant commitment and action by all\r\nhuman beings, all nations, all peoples and all humanitarian\r\ninstitutions, such as the one I proudly serve.\r\nWe wish this lofty and vital institution at the service\r\nof all mankind, and its thousands of hard-working people,\r\na happy fiftieth anniversary and every success in the work\r\nthey undertake. In their responsible, systematic quest for\r\npeace and full justice, they overcome disagreement and\r\ndiscord, and in so doing, pave the way to a comprehensive,\r\nlasting peace, without the wars or social conflicts that\r\ndivide mankind. For the sake of the future of humanity,\r\nthis must be achieved. This is the lofty mission and the\r\ngreat challenge of the United Nations.\r\nAllow me, on behalf of the International Federation\r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, to congratulate\r\nthe United Nations on its fiftieth anniversary and on its\r\ngreat achievements.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the\r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nSocieties for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mario Enrique Villarroel\r\nLander, President of the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker for\r\nthis morning’s meeting.\r\nMay I ask once again, and for the last time, for\r\npunctuality at 3 o’clock this afternoon.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n32\r\n"
