(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the General\r\nAssembly’s attention to document A/50/444/Addendum 6.\r\nIn a letter contained in that document, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs me that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications dated 19 and 22 September and 2, 4 16\r\nand 18 October 1995, Chad has made the necessary\r\npayment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 29 (continued)\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations\r\nThe President: This afternoon we hold the last\r\nmeeting of the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Sali Berisha, President\r\nof the Republic of Albania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Sali Berisha, President of\r\nthe Republic of Albania.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sali Berisha, President of the\r\nRepublic of Albania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Berisha: I deem it a special pleasure to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for its fiftieth session, as well as the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nskilful leadership of the Organization.\r\nToday, 50 years after the United Nations Charter\r\nentered into force, we have come here with the\r\nunflinching confidence that the purposes and principles\r\nenshrined in it have served and will serve mankind to\r\nattain its aspirations to peace and global security, the\r\nequality of peoples and their right to self-determination,\r\ninternational cooperation for development and progress,\r\nand respect for freedoms and human rights.\r\nThe Republic of Albania highly appreciates the\r\ncontribution of the United Nations during this half-century\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nto the prevention of a global conflict, the settlement of\r\nconflicts, the enhancement of international security, and the\r\nmitigation of the suffering of millions of people caught in\r\nthe grip of conflicts or poverty, and its support for\r\neconomic development in the world and for the democratic\r\nprocess.\r\nThe United Nations is commemorating its fiftieth\r\nanniversary at an important turning-point in the great\r\nachievements of mankind, among them the fall of the Iron\r\nCurtain and the collapse of the communist dictatorships,\r\nunder which many countries, including Albania, suffered a\r\ngreat deal. The fall of the Iron Curtain — and the United\r\nNations also had a positive influence on that event —\r\naverted the threat of a large-scale confrontation and ushered\r\nin a period of difficult transition for the countries of\r\nEastern Europe, but not only for them. In this process,\r\ninternational institutions turned out to be not always\r\ninterlocking, but sometimes interblocking.\r\nThe international community, heading into the twenty-\r\nfirst century, is growing ever more aware of the need to\r\nredirect its advance towards a more reliable international\r\norder for everyone. The United Nations and its agencies can\r\nrender a new contribution to this trend, to the benefit of\r\npresent history.\r\nAs a Balkan country, Albania is greatly concerned\r\nabout the infringement of human values and the violation\r\nof the international conventions and agreements in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. We have condemned Serbian\r\naggression — the cause of the suffering of millions of\r\npeople in Bosnia and Herzegovina — and the creation of\r\n“ethnically cleansed” territories by force. We support the\r\npeace talks initiated by the United States, and we take the\r\nview that the involvement of troops of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization is vital, not only to establish peace and\r\na lasting settlement that does not rehabilitate the aggressor\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also to prevent a chain of\r\nconflicts in the Balkans and beyond — something that the\r\nultra-nationalist forces would like to instigate.\r\nBesides, the Balkan crisis started in Kosova, and\r\nwithout a settlement of the Kosova issue, there can be no\r\nlong-term peace in the former Yugoslavia or stability in the\r\nBalkans. It is indispensable that the questions of putting an\r\nend to the violation of the human and national rights of the\r\nAlbanians in Kosova, restoring the democratic institutions\r\nthere and commencing talks between the Belgrade\r\nauthorities and the legitimate representatives of the\r\nAlbanians of Kosova, in the presence of a third party —\r\ntalks including the question of resolving Kosova’s future\r\nstatus in accordance with international agreements — be\r\nincluded in the package of Contact Group negotiations on\r\na solution to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. By\r\ninsisting on the implementation of General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/204 of last December, which includes these\r\ndemands, the United Nations would be doing a great\r\nservice for peace and security in our region and continent.\r\nAlbania remains determined to oppose the changing\r\nof borders through violence and to establish relations of\r\nregional cooperation with its neighbours. In compliance\r\nwith this policy, we consider as a real achievement the\r\ncommitment — an undertaking by the Presidents of\r\nBulgaria, Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and Albania in this very palace of the United\r\nNations two days ago — to build an integrating horizontal\r\ntransport and telecommunications corridor to radiate to\r\nother States, within and outside the region. This corridor\r\nwill bring greater closeness and unity between our\r\ncountries themselves, between the Balkan countries and\r\nthe European Union, and between East and West. The\r\nproject has aroused the interest of the European Union\r\nand the United States. We would greatly appreciate the\r\ncommitment of the World Bank and other financial\r\ninstitutions to its realization.\r\nI think that the vertical corridor between Ljubljana\r\nand Athens could be the object of another integrating\r\nproject in the Balkan peninsula.\r\nOver the 50 years since the inception of the United\r\nNations, Albania survived one of the most bitter\r\ndictatorial experiences of the continent. In flagrant\r\nviolation of the principles of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, which it had signed, more than 400,000\r\nAlbanians were jailed, interned, tortured or executed, and\r\nthousands of religious institutions in the country, many of\r\nthem centuries old, were dynamited and demolished.\r\nI am very pleased to declare today that the rule of\r\nlaw and the market economy have been established in\r\nAlbania and that all the former communist laws have\r\nbeen replaced. Though, in the past, it was a country\r\nwhere freedoms and human rights were prohibited by law,\r\nin Albania today there are hundreds of private newspapers\r\nand magazines. From a country where religious beliefs\r\nwere banned, it has turned into a centre of religious\r\ntolerance par excellence. A country that used to regard\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions as enslaving, it now\r\ncooperates very successfully with them, as it does with\r\nvery many different United Nations agencies.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nAlthough it was the last State to sign the Helsinki\r\nFinal Act, Albania today meets the criteria of the\r\nCopenhagen Document on human and minority rights of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nThough, in the past, a country of total collectivism, the\r\nAlbania of today attributes 75 per cent of its gross domestic\r\nproduct (GDP) to the private sector and boasts a two-digit\r\neconomic-growth rate and a one-digit inflation rate, while\r\nthe GDP-foreign debt ratio is less than 10 per cent.\r\nAll this testifies that freedom is working in Albania.\r\nFrom the most isolated and closed country of the planet, it\r\nhas turned into a country which has resolutely committed\r\nitself to full integration into the international community —\r\nat the regional level by becoming a member of the Council\r\nof Europe, and at the global level by actively participating\r\nin the activities of this Organization. Albania has attached\r\ndue importance to fulfilment of its financial obligations to\r\nthe United Nations and has expressed its willingness, and\r\nmade preparations, to provide troops for United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThe decision of the Albanian Government to declare\r\nthe country a candidate for a non-permanent Security\r\nCouncil seat allocated to the Eastern European Group for\r\nthe term 1996-1997 is an expression of the will and\r\nreadiness of Albania for more active participation in the\r\nOrganization. We think that the small countries too can\r\nmake a valuable contribution to the United Nations, and we\r\nconsider the lack of equitable representation an expression\r\nof discrimination against them that violates the very spirit\r\nof the Charter.\r\nThe Republic of Albania supports the proposal to\r\nincrease the membership of the Security Council, as this\r\nwould better conform to the new reality and would add to\r\nefficiency in the Council’s work. The increase in the\r\nnumber of Members of the Organization — more than\r\nthreefold — over the last 50 years calls for a reassessment\r\nof the role of the small States, which are very interested in\r\nhaving a powerful Organization and aspire to making an\r\nactive contribution to its activity. We consider it important\r\nto create conditions in which these countries enjoy more\r\nequitable representation on the main organs.\r\nWith the adoption of the Declaration at the end of\r\nthese special meetings, the Republic of Albania will commit\r\nitself to cooperation towards revitalizing the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the fields of peace, progress, equality and\r\njustice, with a view to serving the present generation and\r\nguaranteeing a better world for future generations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Albania for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sali Berisha, President of the\r\nRepublic of Albania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Fidel V. Ramos,\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Philippines\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Fidel Ramos, President of\r\nthe Republic of the Philippines.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fidel V. Ramos, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Philippines, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Ramos: As a country that signed the\r\nUnited Nations Charter in San Francisco in 1945, and as\r\nthe current Chairman of the Group of 77, the Philippines\r\nconsiders it an exciting privilege to take part in the work\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn five turbulent decades we have seen the\r\ndecolonization of virtually the whole world, the rise of\r\nhuman rights to the forefront of world concerns, the\r\nengagement of our world community in reform for the\r\nwelfare of children, women, minorities and the\r\nenvironment, and, most of all, the work of re-engineering\r\ndevelopment in the poor regions of the world. Now we\r\nmust ensure that this Organization is adequate to meet the\r\nchallenges of a new era.\r\nLet us remember that the United Nations was\r\ncreated — as the Charter says —\r\n“to promote ... better standards of life in larger\r\nfreedom”\r\nall over the world.\r\nToday, we know that poor countries — given the\r\nright policies and just a little assistance — can actually\r\ndevelop and raise their standards of living. Yet, sadly, we\r\nfind in the developed countries, and even in some of the\r\nmore advanced developing nations, a deplorable effort to\r\nturn back the tide by closing their markets to exports\r\nfrom other countries and raising false issues about the\r\nenvironment and labour standards.\r\nWe must therefore now press forward even more\r\nintensively the work of the United Nations to spread\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\neconomic progress and social justice, the lack of which is\r\nthe root cause of conflict. Let us with equal dispatch\r\nstrengthen the United Nations agencies involved in\r\npromoting social justice and economic progress.\r\nThe fact remains that the gap between rich and poor\r\nnations endures, and in some cases is widening by\r\ndangerous proportions. Peace cannot grow in any society\r\ngripped by poverty and misery.\r\nIn the work of peacemaking, adjustments are clearly\r\nin order. While the threat to global peace from nuclear\r\nconfrontation has greatly diminished, in its place have\r\narisen many regional and ethnic conflicts that are as deadly\r\nand that constitute both a challenge and an affront to the\r\ncollective conscience of mankind. Therefore, we should not\r\nneglect the chance to push the United Nations into a more\r\nforthright stand against all acts, methods and practices of\r\nterrorism, for terrorism is a dagger aimed at the very heart\r\nof each nation’s security, and at global stability.\r\nMoreover, we must condemn the grotesque obsession\r\nwith nuclear weapons and other instruments of mass\r\ndestruction and work concertedly for the conclusion next\r\nyear of a comprehensive test-ban treaty that will put a stop\r\nto all nuclear testing for all time.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of 77, I also draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to the problems arising from the\r\nlarge-scale migration of workers. For the great majority of\r\nthem, migration means deprivation of rights, double\r\nstandards in the eyes of the law and, worse, exposure to\r\nviolence and abuse. We urge the convening by the United\r\nNations of an international conference specifically to\r\naddress the plight of migrant workers. That the International\r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant\r\nWorkers and Members of their Families remains to be\r\nratified by many countries is just one more reminder of the\r\ndifficult road we still have to travel.\r\nFinally, let us not allow this commemoration to pass\r\nwithout addressing the issue of reforming the United\r\nNations, its organization, its processes and its finances. The\r\nmost efficient organization in the world cannot effectively\r\nfunction without stable and predictable financing. We\r\ntherefore call upon all Members to fulfil their financial\r\nobligations to the United Nations and to do so on time. We\r\nsupport reform of the Security Council itself. We believe\r\nthat the membership should be enlarged and reapportioned\r\nto ensure equitable representation of all geographic regions\r\nand of the developing countries.\r\nThis is not to express impatience with an institution\r\nthat has served our world with such dedication for half a\r\ncentury. This is rather to express the hope that our United\r\nNations of the future will be even more caring and\r\nproactive and the bridge to the fulfilment of our peoples’\r\naspirations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof the Philippines for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fidel V. Ramos, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Philippines, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Cde. Robert Gabriel\r\nMugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Comrade Robert Gabriel\r\nMugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nHis Excellency Cde. Robert Gabriel Mugabe,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Mugabe: The fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations is indeed an occasion to reflect on its past,\r\npresent and future role and function. We join the chorus\r\nof well-deserved praise to the United Nations for its\r\nsterling role in the prevention of global conflict and for\r\nits support of the various struggles for decolonization and\r\nthe achievement of self-determination.\r\nFor us in Africa, the contribution of the United\r\nNations in the decolonization and democratization\r\nprocesses has been an outstanding and honourable one,\r\nwith the result that today southern Africa, once described\r\nby a Portuguese seafarer as a “region of storms”, has\r\nfinally and truly become a region of good hope where the\r\noppressive settler regimes once consolidated by the\r\nUnilateral Declaration of Independence, apartheid and\r\nother ruthless systems of governance have succumbed to\r\nthe revolutionary will of the majority, paving the way to\r\npeace, stability and regional cooperation.\r\nBut the departure of colonial rule has not left us\r\nunscathed. The ethnic and tribal hostilities fomented by\r\ncolonial regimes in their divide-and-rule power strategy\r\nhave persisted in several of our countries, tearing some of\r\nour nations apart. The intensity and viciousness of ethnic\r\nwars are as manifest in Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia and\r\nSomalia, as they are in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and yet\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\ngenocide taking place in Rwanda is accorded less\r\nsignificance by the world than genocide in Bosnia. Somalia\r\nis left burning while catastrophe stalks. Western United\r\nNations forces withdraw from Somalia only to deploy under\r\nthe cover of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in\r\nBosnia. Where, we ask, is the brotherhood of man? Where,\r\nwe ask, is man’s impartiality? Where, indeed, is the proof\r\nof his non-racialism? Is it a scourge to be black, we ask?\r\nWhat has happened to our universally accepted\r\nconcept of the global village? Do we need drug traffickers,\r\nmerchants of terrorism and pandemic diseases to be\r\npersuaded that the concept is real enough? I fear that, if we\r\ntoday neglect the tragedy of the millions of the starving\r\npoor and refugees, we shall tomorrow surely reap the\r\nwhirlwind of another “black death”.\r\nThe many changes that have taken place in our\r\ninternational relations demand to be reflected in the\r\nstructures of our international organizations. The need for\r\nthe restructuring and transformation of the United Nations\r\nto reflect the realities of today’s world and not those of 50\r\nyears ago is exceedingly urgent. The Security Council, as\r\nnow constituted, empowers only a small minority of the\r\nvictorious allies of a war of half a century ago to continue\r\nto wield sweeping powers that enable it to take or block\r\ndecisions affecting the destiny of the majority of Member\r\nStates sitting in the General Assembly. This despotism in\r\nthe Security Council, especially the power of veto, defies\r\nlogic and runs counter to the very democratic principles and\r\nvalues that are demanded of Member States in their\r\ndomestic political practices. We have listened to the\r\nstatements of the leaders of these historically privileged\r\ncountries, and none of them made any reference at all to\r\nthe need for democratizing this institution. I ask them all to\r\nanswer the question of whether or not they accept the\r\nprinciple of democracy for the United Nations. Is it yes or\r\nno?\r\nMembership in the Security Council must reflect a fair\r\ngeographical representation of all the regions in the world.\r\nIndeed, the United Nations system as a whole needs to be\r\nreformed and revitalized in order to render it more\r\ntransparent, accountable and democratic.\r\nOur hope that the establishment of the World Trade\r\nOrganization would herald a new framework for an\r\nequitable and fair international trading system is already\r\nproving forlorn. Current trade relations are still bedeviled\r\nby the old reflexes of protectionism and unilateralism. The\r\nBretton Woods institutions remain unreformed and, as their\r\nstructures continue to defy democracy, they continue to act\r\nas dictatorial taskmasters on behalf of the world’s rich\r\nand powerful nations, their harsh and punitive measures\r\nthus wreaking havoc on our poor societies still struggling\r\nto wriggle out from under the colonial legacy of misery\r\nand developmental neglect.\r\nIt is no secret that the United Nations is now in the\r\ngrip of a financial crisis. For the Organization to meet its\r\ngrowing responsibilities and challenges, Member States\r\nhave to honour their Charter obligations. A car without\r\nfuel will not perform; neither can a United Nations\r\nwithout resources.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my country’s\r\ncommitment to work for a better world, while reiterating\r\nthe view that the challenge of today is for us to transform\r\nand strengthen our world body for the benefit of future\r\ngenerations. A democratic world needs democratic\r\ninstitutions at both the national and the international\r\nlevels. The United Nations must therefore reflect that\r\nworld.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Zimbabwe for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Cde. Robert Gabriel Mugabe,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas\r\nBrazauskas, President of the Republic of Lithuania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas\r\nBrazauskas, President of the Republic of Lithuania.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Brazauskas (spoke in Lithuanian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): All of us gathered here\r\nin the most important assembly hall of the planet are\r\nunited by the hope and belief in a new world order, in a\r\nworld based on the unity of nations in the pursuit of\r\npeace and prosperity on Earth. It is not solely for the\r\npurpose of marking this special occasion that we should\r\nreflect upon the experience of this unique Organization.\r\nWe must enhance its effectiveness and establish new\r\ncollective mechanisms to surmount the challenges of the\r\npresent and those that lie ahead.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nSince the collapse of the bipolar system, the world has\r\nbeen more acutely confronted with old and seemingly\r\nintractable problems in the fields of international migration,\r\npopulation and the environment. New concerns dealing with\r\nthe development and consolidation of peace, social justice\r\nand democracy have emerged.\r\nLithuania considers the State responsibility for good\r\ngovernance and economic and social stability to be the\r\nmeans to guarantee human security and prosperity. At the\r\nsame time, we are striving to build a civil society that can\r\nactively and responsibly participate in the resolution of\r\ninternational problems.\r\nToday Lithuania takes pride in its good relations with\r\nall neighbouring States. These relations are based on law\r\nand the principles of good-neighbourliness. To achieve this,\r\nwe had to transcend negative historical stereotypes, as well\r\nas to overcome re-emergent suspicion and mistrust. The\r\nworld could achieve significant progress if the majority of\r\nStates succeeded in maintaining such cooperative relations\r\nwith their own neighbours.\r\nToday, the role of the United Nations has increased\r\nsignificantly in the realm of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Lithuania supports the leading role of the United\r\nNations in peace-keeping operations and the\r\nrecommendations laid out in “An Agenda for Peace”.\r\nPresent-day realities confirm that the ideological\r\nconfrontations of the cold-war era have been replaced by\r\nlong-term localized conflicts. The importance of preventive\r\ndiplomacy becomes even more evident in preventing the\r\noutbreak of armed conflicts and the humanitarian crises that\r\noften accompany them. For this reason, Lithuania greatly\r\nvalues the work of the Organization in this area as well as\r\nin post-conflict situation management. The new era\r\ndemands more effective and complementary interaction\r\nwith regional structures, such as the European Union, the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nWe are in favour of a more defined distribution of\r\ngoals and tasks and increased coordination of the respective\r\nactivities of United Nations peace-keeping operations and\r\npreventive diplomacy missions. Lithuania actively\r\nparticipates in these initiatives and is willing to increase its\r\ninvolvement in the maintenance of international security.\r\nLithuania is well aware of the fact there could be no\r\nother United Nations. At the same time, we understand the\r\nneed for reform of this institution. The United Nations,\r\nlike its Member States, has had its share of successes and\r\nfailures. The Organization has not had the capacity to\r\nkeep up with the ever-evolving challenges facing the\r\ninternational community. The United Nations has thus\r\nfallen into a deep crisis and a difficult financial situation.\r\nRegrettably, this also points to a clear lack of collective\r\npolitical will on the part of Member States.\r\nReform must begin with the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system and the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil. Lithuania supports the inclusion of Germany and\r\nJapan among the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil and seeks to ensure the adequate representation\r\nof the interests of small States in this body. The\r\nOrganization must resolutely meet the ever-evolving\r\nchallenges to humankind: transnational crime, drug\r\ntrafficking, international terrorism and the spread of\r\nAIDS.\r\nWe do not question the priority accorded to\r\ninternational peace and security issues. But the security\r\nand peace-keeping functions of the United Nations should\r\nnot be pursued at the expense of economic and social\r\nprogrammes. We will seek to have the economic and\r\nsocial policy needs and priorities of the countries in\r\ntransition reflected in the “Agenda for Development”, as\r\nwe did earlier this year with respect to the work of the\r\ninternational conferences in Copenhagen and Beijing.\r\nFifty years of United Nations work have been\r\ncrowned with tangible and laudable achievements. Most\r\nimportantly, the number of democratic States has\r\nincreased dramatically over those years. The global\r\nnuclear threat has decreased. Yet the thread of life\r\nremains vulnerable. We have no other choice but to live\r\ntogether, seeking to better understand one another and to\r\ncooperate more closely.\r\nThat is the basis of my optimism and faith in man as\r\nwell as in the future.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Lithuania for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Martti Ahtisaari,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Finland\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, President\r\nof the Republic of Finland.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, President of the\r\nRepublic of Finland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Ahtisaari: The founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations had the vision of a global system of\r\ncollective security. Mindful of the lessons of the 1930s,\r\nthey wanted to ensure prompt action by the United Nations\r\nto keep watch on the state of peace and security, seek\r\ncooperative solutions, and deal effectively with aggression.\r\nThe cold war ruined this vision. Now we have the historic\r\nopportunity to restore the United Nations as originally\r\nconceived. Yet our Organization is crippled by massive\r\nnon-payment of properly assessed contributions, in breach\r\nof Charter obligations. I am deeply concerned about this\r\ntendency to run down the United Nations.\r\nIt is also customary to criticize the United Nations and\r\nits Secretariat. I have worked in the United Nations, and I\r\nknow that there are a great many dedicated and competent\r\nmen and women in this Organization, led by our Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nToday the world needs the United Nations for global\r\ngovernance: to foster peace and enhance the rights of every\r\nhuman being through sustainable development. Our\r\nimmediate task is to provide effective follow-up to the\r\nsuccessful conferences held in Rio, Cairo, Copenhagen and\r\nBeijing.\r\nMore than ever, the Security Council is needed to\r\nensure effective action for peace. A representative Security\r\nCouncil, reflecting the realities of today’s world, is the best\r\nguarantee of effectiveness. Finland therefore supports an\r\nenlarged Security Council, including new permanent\r\nmembers from all regions.\r\nThe end of the cold war has provided the United\r\nNations with new opportunities to strengthen international\r\npeace and security. It has helped the world to focus on\r\nthreats to our common security which are not amenable to\r\nresolution by military means. This is already true in\r\nEurope, the principal theatre of the cold war, with the\r\nEuropean Union as the main actor projecting stability and\r\nprosperity throughout the continent.\r\nTwo recent reports of the Secretary-General have\r\nfocused global discussion. “An Agenda for Peace” and “An\r\nAgenda for Development” provide a wealth of ideas to\r\nmeet the challenges of the post-cold-war world. It is our\r\nduty, as leaders, to turn ideas into practice.\r\nI shall take up one proposal which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral placed before us in his Agenda for Peace. He has\r\nsuggested that the United Nations should have its own\r\nrapid reaction force when there is an emergency need for\r\npeace-keeping troops.\r\nI find myself in profound sympathy with the\r\nSecretary-General’s concerns. My own involvement with\r\nthe United Nations has convinced me of the need for the\r\ninternational community to react in a rapid and concrete\r\nmanner to emergencies. I am convinced that the United\r\nNations should establish, as part of the reform, an\r\neffective, integrated, multinational crisis management\r\ncapability to meet the challenge of future emergencies.\r\nDiscussion to date has shown that perhaps the most\r\npractical way to make progress in the short term is to\r\nfurther develop the existing stand-by forces arrangement.\r\nStand-by arrangements are not enough to guarantee the\r\navailability of troops. Therefore we must think ahead. The\r\nNordic experience in peace-keeping provides a solid\r\nfoundation for innovation. The Nordic countries have\r\nalready created two joint battalions that now operate\r\nsuccessfully as part of the United Nations peace forces in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia.\r\nA well trained and lean force that could be quickly\r\ndispatched by the United Nations or the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe to perform\r\ndemanding humanitarian or peace-keeping missions is a\r\nnecessity for the future. The Government of Finland is at\r\npresent preparing a Finnish stand-by force for this very\r\npurpose.\r\nI propose that the Secretary-General entrust an\r\neminent person, independent and well qualified in both\r\nthe military and political practice of peace-keeping, to sift\r\nfrom the plethora of ideas a limited number of practical\r\nand politically feasible recommendations for action by the\r\ntime of the next General Assembly.\r\nFor five decades, the United Nations has sought to\r\nprovide security in the broadest sense of the word. The\r\nworld Organization has been a source of inspiration and\r\nan obstacle to cynicism. We may not always recognize its\r\nefforts, and we may sometimes even resent them. But we\r\ncannot do without it.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Finland for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, President of the\r\nRepublic of Finland, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Levon Ter-Petrossian,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Armenia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Levon Ter-Petrossian,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Armenia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Levon Ter-Petrossian, President of\r\nthe Republic of Armenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Ter-Petrossian (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Armenia, as a State, was not among the original\r\nsignatories of the United Nations Charter. Nevertheless\r\nArmenia, as a nation, had sent to the battlefields of the\r\nSecond World War some 600,000 of its sons and daughters,\r\nnearly half of whom never came home. It is in their\r\nmemory that Armenia, as an independent State, is proud to\r\ntake its rightful place in this Assembly to celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\r\nIn view of the situation in 1945, it was only natural\r\nthat the Charter of the United Nations should deal primarily\r\nwith the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations played a pivotal role in the\r\nreconstruction that followed the devastation of the world\r\nwar, and it has so far been able to prevent the world being\r\nplunged into global conflict. Even during the cold war, the\r\nvery existence of an international forum in which countries\r\nmight discuss global issues prevented the outbreak of many\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe United Nations continues to play a constructive\r\nrole in containing regional conflicts, for instance in the\r\nnegotiations aimed at settling the conflict in Nagorny\r\nKarabakh under the auspices of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. In this respect, I\r\nshould like to reaffirm the resolve of the Armenian side to\r\ncomply with the longstanding cease-fire and to transform it,\r\nas soon as possible, into a lasting peace.\r\nSafeguarding peace is but one of the objectives of the\r\nOrganization. The United Nations, and the world, have\r\nmade significant progress on many fronts since 1945.\r\nThanks to the decolonization process, the elimination of\r\napartheid, the collapse of the old order and the emergence\r\nof new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe and in\r\nthe former Soviet Union, hundreds of millions of people\r\nhave been assured the fundamental right of self-\r\ndetermination and their rightful voice in the community\r\nof nations.\r\nOur Organization has also enabled nations the world\r\nover to express their views on a broad range of subjects,\r\nincluding strategies for economic and social development,\r\nhuman rights, environmental protection and the promotion\r\nof international law. At the same time, the work of United\r\nNations specialized agencies has directly improved the\r\nlives of millions of people throughout the world.\r\nArmenia would like the United Nations to be\r\nstrengthened and to be accorded greater respect. We are\r\ngrateful to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for\r\nthe tireless efforts he has made to reform the United\r\nNations system in this changing world. Under his\r\nguidance, substantial progress has been made in the\r\nmanagement of the Organization. At his initiative,\r\ndiscussions have taken place in recent years on the\r\nproposals he made in “An Agenda for Peace”, in “An\r\nAgenda for Development” and, more recently, in his\r\n“Supplement to An Agenda for Peace\u0027”.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to salute all those\r\nwho have served the United Nations over the past 50\r\nyears, and to pay special tribute to the men and women\r\nwho have given their lives in the line of duty. We honour\r\ntheir memory, and we pledge to continue their mission.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe President of the Republic of Armenia for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Levon Ter-Petrossian, President\r\nof the Republic of Armenia, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand\r\nAristide, President of the Republic of Haiti\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Aristide (interpretation from French): I\r\nam pleased to greet Your Excellencies on behalf of the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nGovernment and the people of Haiti. Today, both in our\r\nown country and in the diaspora — or our “tenth\r\nprovince” — 7 million Haitians chant in unison, “Continued\r\npeace, happiness and success for the great family of the\r\nUnited Nations”.\r\nCelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations is especially meaningful for the world’s first\r\nindependent black republic. It gives us the opportunity also\r\nto celebrate the first anniversary of the return of democracy\r\nto Haiti. Our return to Haiti, on 15 October 1994, after\r\nthree years of exile, and the peace achieved through this\r\ndemocratic process constitute a political miracle. I say\r\nhumbly but unequivocally that this is the first time that\r\nsuch a miracle has taken place anywhere in the world. It\r\ncame about thanks to the heroism and courage of the\r\nHaitian people, to the leadership of President Clinton, to\r\nyou, Mr. Secretary-General, and to all of our dear United\r\nNations friends. Gratitude is the heart’s memory; let the\r\nbeating of our hearts express our intense joy at having\r\ntogether achieved this miracle of the century.\r\nNow that peace has been restored, domestic production\r\nhas increased by 3 per cent, while in 1994 it had declined\r\nby 10 per cent. By December 1995, the rate of growth may\r\nrise to 4.5 per cent. Earnings are 85 per cent higher than\r\nthose of the two years preceding our return. Today they\r\namount to 2.231 billion gourdes, or 7.5 per cent of our\r\ngross national product. Moreover, our budget deficit has\r\nbeen reduced from 1.4 billion gourdes to 350 million\r\ngourdes. In three years’ time, 85 per cent of our population\r\nwill be not illiterate, but literate.\r\nThese figures give us new hope and are a sign of the\r\nlight of peace that floods our hearts, dazzles our eyes and\r\ndrives out the shadows of violence. Gunfire no longer\r\ncrackles. Zam yo bèbè. The army has met with disaster; it\r\nno longer exists. Li kraze. In our Parliament, I hope we\r\nshall soon be observing its official funeral.\r\nThe establishment of a national police force and the\r\nenactment of judicial reform are breathing new life into our\r\ndemocracy. Justice safeguards social bonds; it nurtures\r\nreconciliation, dignity and respect for the rights of the\r\nindividual. It is in that context that legislative elections\r\nhave taken place as we await our presidential elections,\r\nwhich are certain to be free, honest and democratic.\r\nYes, today the blooming of these first flowers of\r\ndemocracy is emitting a sweet aroma of peace and hope;\r\nmay the great United Nations family spread this delicious\r\nperfume throughout the world. May this peace bloom at\r\nlast in Bosnia, in Georgia, in Rwanda, in Burundi.\r\nBy the year 2050 the world’s population will have\r\nreached 10 billion. May our hearts be fired by enthusiasm\r\nto prepare a better world for these people and to light up\r\nthe history of mankind as it approaches the end of the\r\nmillennium. In that way the United Nations will be\r\ncrowned with a halo of glory, pride and peace.\r\nIf we all stand together, this will be possible, for:\r\nalone we are weak; together we are strong; all together,\r\nwe are lavalas.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Haiti for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, President\r\nof the Republic of Malawi.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Muluzi: The United Nations is 50 years\r\nold today, and this is cause for celebration. Where I come\r\nfrom, old age is traditionally associated with wisdom. The\r\nUnited Nations has learnt from its experience and has\r\nbecome wiser with time. This is one of the many reasons\r\nwhy we, the people of Malawi, believe that the United\r\nNations deserves to be supported, and to be treated with\r\neven greater respect than ever before.\r\nIt would have been nice if the United Nations had\r\nperformed miracles these past 50 years. It would have\r\nbeen nice if, for example, it had succeeded in preventing\r\nhuman beings from wantonly slaughtering each other on\r\na regular basis. The United Nations has failed to perform\r\nthis particular miracle: human beings all over the world\r\ncontinue to kill each other for political, tribal, religious\r\nand all sorts of other reasons. Despite our wishes, the\r\nworld has yet to become one big, happy family. And this\r\nmeans that the United Nations still has a crucial role to\r\nplay in bringing peace, stability, freedom and justice to\r\nthe world.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nMalawi applauds the role played by the United\r\nNations in promoting social and economic development and\r\nin championing the causes of the world’s poor. The\r\n“Agenda for Peace” recently devised by the United Nations\r\nfirmly established the linkage between global peace and\r\ndevelopment. The simple fact is that we can never have\r\npeace until we have social justice, and we can never have\r\nsocial justice until we address the economic issues faced by\r\nmost of our Member countries today.\r\nWe also wish to applaud the United Nations for its\r\ncampaign to promote the rule of law among Member States,\r\nas shown by the Organization’s uncompromising insistence\r\non the observance of human rights.\r\nWith the cold war over and political ideology playing\r\nless and less of a role in international affairs, it is\r\nunfortunate that one great country, China, remains divided\r\nfor ideological reasons. Malawi therefore wishes to register\r\nits support for efforts to reconcile the two sides and to\r\nresolve the issue of division with a view to eventual\r\nreunification. This would be within the spirit of democracy\r\nwhich the United Nations stands for.\r\nMalawi wishes to join other Member States in\r\nendorsing the platforms of action agreed upon at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, the International\r\nConference on Population and Development and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, as constituting a noble and\r\nviable agenda for the United Nations as it sets out on the\r\njourney into the next 50 years and beyond.\r\nOnce again, the people and the Government of Malawi\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. Secretary-General, and you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on this most auspicious occasion. Long live the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Malawi for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, President of the\r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Samper Pizano (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The commemoration of the first 50 years of the\r\nUnited Nations is an excellent opportunity to look at the\r\npast and plan for the future.\r\nA review of history teaches us lessons we cannot\r\nignore. Genuine multilateralism, that is, decisions based\r\non the will of majorities, has allowed humanity to rid\r\nitself of some of its worst problems, such as colonialism,\r\napartheid and the nuclear arms race.\r\nLast week, in Cartagena de Indias, the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement held its XI Conference of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment, and Colombia assumed the chairmanship of\r\nthe Movement for the next three years. In Cartagena, the\r\nNon-Aligned countries reaffirmed the full validity of the\r\nMovement and its will to work actively for the benefit\r\nand in the interests of the countries of the South.\r\nThe significance of our action will depend upon our\r\ncapacity to give appropriate answers to questions arising\r\nfrom the international situation of the 1990s and to\r\nprepare ourselves successfully to face the challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nAlthough it is true that the cold war has ended, as\r\nwe all know, poverty persists; so do the environmental\r\nproblems that are turning our earth into a desert. Greed to\r\nacquire armaments still hovers over the earth like a\r\nspectre.\r\nOld ideological barriers have given way to new\r\nones: new protectionist trade barriers that limit the access\r\nof our products to the markets of industrialized countries;\r\ntechnological barriers that isolate us from the knowledge\r\nwe need to achieve development; and ethnic and religious\r\nbarriers in whose name some continue to kill each other.\r\nIn Cartagena, we reaffirmed our will to continue the\r\nstruggle against all those new barriers that impede our\r\ndevelopment, as was once the case with the wall that\r\nseparated two seemingly irreconcilable political systems.\r\nThe problems that affect our people have an\r\nincreasingly transnational nature and this fact, instead of\r\nleading us to accept a new era of intervention, must be\r\nfaced with a firm will to cooperate with one another. The\r\ngreat challenge before us springs from the understanding\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nthat the problems that are bringing us together march at a\r\nmuch faster pace than the solutions we should already have\r\nagreed upon in order to resolve them.\r\nInternational solidarity is not only the best answer: it\r\nis the only answer. We need each other because the\r\nsolution to world problems can be obtained only through\r\ncommon actions. One such common action is that required\r\nto tackle the problem of drug trafficking.\r\nColombia has been the country most victimized by\r\ndrug trafficking and the country which has combated it\r\nmost successfully. The year 1995 will be known to history\r\nas the period of greatest achievements against the drug\r\ncartels. The Cali Cartel has been brought to justice, and the\r\neradication of illegal crops has reached unprecedented\r\nlevels. We have put 80 per cent of the cocaine market out\r\nof business. Coca paste prices are now 10 times less than\r\nthey were, while consumer prices have risen significantly.\r\nWhether these achievements will bring progress in this\r\nstruggle or not will depend upon the responsibilities that the\r\ncountries of the world assume. We cannot continue this\r\nunending debate over who is responsible, with each country\r\nblaming its neighbour for its own faults. We have to\r\nunderstand that a business which moves more than $500\r\nbillion per year cannot be combated by one country or one\r\ngroup of countries acting alone. We are all responsible. The\r\nmoment is now or never.\r\nPresident Bill Clinton was right when, in his statement\r\nlast Sunday, he highlighted the fact that the blows we have\r\ninflicted upon drug traffickers have been the fruit of our\r\ncommon work. He is also right in pointing out the need to\r\nface squarely up to the problem of consumption and its\r\nrelation to the increase in social criminality. Colombia\r\nassociates itself with President Clinton’s declaration of war\r\nagainst the laundering of money and assets flowing from\r\nthe illicit drug market.\r\nColombia is convinced that the success of these\r\nactions will depends on the extent to which they are carried\r\nout at the multilateral level, and not only in our country.\r\nMoney laundering, which is typically an international crime,\r\ninvolves actors and behaviours that must be prosecuted and\r\npunished in all countries, wherever they may arise. Let us\r\npunish financial systems that, wherever in the world they\r\nmay be, whether by omission or commission, allow the\r\npollution of their accounts with the profits flowing from\r\ndrug trafficking.\r\nLet us punish all industries worldwide that\r\nknowingly sell chemicals used as precursors for the\r\nindustrial processing of drugs. Let us penalize all\r\ncompanies, wherever they may be, that facilitate the\r\nacquisition of durable or non-durable goods or that\r\npromote the smuggling of goods into producing countries\r\nto facilitate money laundering and to hide these infernal\r\nprofits, as well as those real estate enterprises that serve\r\nthe same despicable ends.\r\nLet us thoroughly examine the actions of the\r\ngambling houses, casinos, and lotteries throughout the\r\nworld that pander to the unholy marriage between\r\ngambling and drugs.\r\nMy country, which has paid such huge human and\r\neconomic costs in this often lonely struggle, has been\r\nasking for the convening of a world conference against\r\ndrugs that will combine together the unequivocal will of\r\nthe producing, consuming and distributing countries in the\r\ncommon and firm resolve to mount an integrated attack\r\non this scourge.\r\nIt is almost 10 years now since we subscribed to the\r\nVienna Convention against Illegal Drugs and Psychotropic\r\nSubstances in the hope that it would serve as an\r\ninstrument for the implementation of a strategy of this\r\nkind. It was certainly a great step forward. But we cannot\r\ndeclare ourselves fully satisfied: the trafficking and\r\nconsumption of drugs have increasingly expanded to more\r\ncountries, poisoning more youngsters everyday.\r\nColombia would feel that the memory of the\r\nthousands of victims of this long and cruel war would be\r\nredeemed if the world agreed to make a sincere and\r\nprecise analysis of the need for effective international\r\ncooperation to overcome the most important problem\r\naffecting mankind at the end of this century: the problem\r\nof drugs.\r\nThe creation of the United Nations 50 years ago\r\nsowed the seeds of hope for mankind: hope for peace and\r\nprogress, faith in peaceful mechanisms for the settlement\r\nof conflicts, and belief in multilateralism as we confront\r\nthe most wrenching issues before humankind.\r\nToday we have to rethink what we are, in order to\r\nknow what we want to become. The Bible teaches us that\r\nwithout vision, the people perish. The task of the new\r\nUnited Nations system must be to regain that vision, so\r\nthat we may continue to prevail as a civilization, as a\r\ndemocracy and as rational human beings.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President\r\nof the Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Milan Kučan, President\r\nof the Republic of Slovenia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Milan Kučan, President of\r\nthe Republic of Slovenia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Milan Kučan, President of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Kučan (spoke in Slovenian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I have the pleasure of adding\r\nthe sincere congratulations and fresh hopes of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia to those already received by the United Nations\r\non this occasion. We have the right to trust the United\r\nNations and, at the same time, to expect much from it.\r\nThe United Nations has undoubtedly justified its\r\nestablishment in its 50 years of existence. However, the\r\ngoals defined in the Charter of the United Nations have not\r\nyet been realized. On the contrary, in the key area of its\r\nactivity, the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the United Nations is burdened by an alarming\r\nlack of success. Let me mention only Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the Balkans, because this alone is example\r\nenough. Its lack of readiness or its inability to recognize the\r\ntrue aggressive nature of the war against this sovereign\r\ncountry, a Member of the United Nations, and its\r\nprocrastination and inconsistency in dealing with the issue\r\nof succession in the former Yugoslavia were serious errors.\r\nThese errors could not be redressed by later political,\r\nmilitary, humanitarian and financial involvement, although\r\nthis managed to mitigate to a commendable extent the\r\nconsequences of violence against innocent civilian\r\npopulations.\r\nI wish to stress that the genuine effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security is of crucial importance for the future of the\r\nOrganization. It must continually demonstrate its relevance,\r\ncredibility, and legitimacy: it must confirm its capability.\r\nFor the United Nations, every moment is the moment of\r\ntruth, the moment to face itself.\r\nThe Organization is in its worst political and\r\nfinancial crisis to date. This seems to be a contradiction,\r\nsince mankind expects ever more from the United Nations\r\nand has placed upon it increasingly heavy burdens for the\r\nmaintenance and restoration of peace. Yet it is logical:\r\nunder the weight of events the United Nations has not\r\nbeen reformed either organizationally, financially or\r\npsychologically. There is much truth in the thought that\r\nthere is nothing wrong with the United Nations, but rather\r\nwith its Members. The widely held definition of the\r\nUnited Nations is that it is the sum of its Members. This\r\nis true, but the United Nations is more than just that. If it\r\nwere only the sum of its Member States, it would be\r\nsimilar to any other intergovernmental organization. But\r\nthe United Nations is more. Through the Security Council\r\nit has at its disposal the attributes of State powers such as\r\nresources and arms. It can and must be the highest moral\r\nauthority in the judgement of violations of the basic rules\r\nof international life, coexistence and human rights. From\r\nthis point of view, the United Nations cannot be neutral.\r\nOne of the conditions for the revitalization of the United\r\nNations is whether it aspires to lay down moral standards\r\nin political and legal relations among nations. Such a role\r\ndoes not allow detachment regarding the worst threats to\r\npeace and cooperation, but rather demands moral\r\nengagement and commitment.\r\nThe moral credibility of the United Nations, the\r\nindisputable impression that it stands behind its principles,\r\nis the basis of the next major task the world expects of\r\nthe United Nations: the implementation of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. There is no one more suitable to engage in\r\npreventive diplomacy than the Secretary-General of a\r\nworld Organization which is more than the sum of its\r\nMember States and more than the sum of the major\r\nPowers.\r\nTo become reconciled with ineffectiveness would\r\nmean abandoning the goals on which this Organization\r\nwas founded. It would mean the self-abrogation of the\r\nUnited Nations. We must openly confront this danger.\r\nWith all gravity, we must weigh the relationship between\r\nfree will as a basic principle of the United Nations and\r\nthe need for responsible conduct according to the\r\nprinciples stated in its Charter, a precondition for its\r\neffectiveness as well as for its reputation, authority and\r\ncredibility. No sovereign country has been forced to join\r\nthe United Nations. Membership is based on free choice,\r\nwhich presupposes an acceptance of the obligations and\r\nmeasures imposed by the founding principles of the\r\nUnited Nations. Whoever fails to respect these principles\r\nor acts in contradiction to them acts against the very\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nessence of the Organization and can have no place in it.\r\nThe door to membership must be open wide for all to enter\r\nif they wish, but it must also be open for the departure of\r\nthose who work against the mission of the United Nations.\r\nEveryone must choose his own fate and accept\r\nresponsibility for it. The principle of free will precludes\r\nindifference to, and lack of solidarity with, the common\r\nwill and effort.\r\nI hope that the Member States of the United Nations\r\nwhich have the greatest responsibility for the Organization\r\nhave heard the expressions of concern at this session, that\r\nthey have heard that preventive diplomacy and a policy of\r\nengagement by the United Nations must become a reality\r\nbefore emerging conflicts grow into acute crises.\r\nOf course, responsibility for the future of the United\r\nNations rests with all of us together. Slovenia has already\r\npresented its concrete proposals for the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. We are a part — a small part — of this\r\nOrganization. In it we have placed all our hopes, and we\r\nare fully prepared to carry our share of responsibility for its\r\nsuccess, credibility, and effectiveness.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe people of Slovenia trust that the United Nations\r\nwill live up to the challenges of our time and fulfil the\r\nhopes of the coming century.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Milan Kučan, President of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Islam A. Karimov,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uzbekistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Islam A. Karimov, President\r\nof the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Islam A. Karimov, President of the\r\nRepublic of Uzbekistan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Karimov (interpretation from Russian): I\r\nwant to take this opportunity to dwell on a number of\r\nissues which, to our mind, are significant in the context of\r\nthe problems being discussed at this Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting of the General Assembly.\r\nOne of these urgent contemporary issues is that of\r\nregional security and stability. The seminar on security\r\nand cooperation in Central Asia held in Tashkent in\r\nSeptember this year with the direct support of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was\r\nattended by representatives of 31 States and 6\r\nauthoritative international organizations. It reaffirmed that\r\nglobal security can be achieved through regional security;\r\nin other words, that the path to globalism lies through\r\nregionalism.\r\nAchieving understanding among States in specific\r\nareas and regions, and especially in areas now called \"hot\r\nspots\", requires that we achieve peace throughout the\r\nworld. This is of special importance for the Central Asian\r\nregion, which possesses huge natural, mineral, raw\r\nmaterial and strategic resources and which, more and\r\nmore, is being turned into an arena for rivalry of\r\ngeopolitical and economic interests, as well as for what I\r\nmust call the ambitions of many States.\r\nThe continuing war in Afghanistan has actually\r\nbegun to threaten peace and stability not only in Central\r\nAsia, but in the whole world. This war has already been\r\ngoing on for 17 years; it has brought immeasurable\r\nsuffering to the Afghan people. This war is becoming a\r\nsource of international terrorism, drug trafficking, and the\r\nproliferation of armaments, and is aggravating the already\r\ntense situation in neighbouring Tajikistan. We believe that\r\nthe conflict in Afghanistan could be settled, first of all, by\r\neliminating the interference of external forces. Such\r\ninterference is the basic reason for the continuing war\r\ntoday in Afghanistan. We appeal once again to the\r\nSecurity Council to impose an embargo on the supply of\r\narms to Afghanistan, irrespective of its source.\r\nAfghanistan should be not the object of hostilities,\r\nbut the object of peace and stability. Uzbekistan, as well\r\nas the whole Central Asian region, would like to see the\r\nimplementation of the promising projects supported by\r\nmany international institutions and companies and\r\nconnected with construction of rail and transport\r\ncommunications through the territory of Afghanistan so\r\nthat access for Central Asia to the Indian Ocean ports can\r\nbecome a reality.\r\nThese projects will help to involve millions of the\r\nAfghans in peaceful activities to create new, shorter\r\ncommunications as well as trade and economic ties, and\r\nto change, in principle, geopolitical realities in this\r\nparticularly tense region of the world.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nI feel it necessary to refer from this lofty rostrum to\r\nthe ecological disaster connected with the drying-up of the\r\nAral sea. This problem is acquiring a global character, and\r\nhas a negative impact on the biosphere, the living\r\nconditions, the health and even the heredity of tens of\r\nmillions of people.\r\nToday it is absolutely clear that this problem cannot be\r\nsolved without the support and assistance of international\r\nfinancial institutions and developed countries, with the\r\nUnited Nations playing the organizing role.\r\nWith regard to the need to reform United Nations\r\nstructures and to improve its performance, it is now\r\nessential; first, to expand the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil by including as permanent members such States as\r\nGermany and Japan which today play an important role in\r\nworld politics; secondly, to strengthen the powers of the\r\nSecretary General of the United Nations in order to ensure\r\nthe effective implementation of United Nations decisions;\r\nand, thirdly, it is becoming increasingly clear that\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and international\r\nand regional organizations needs to be revitalized and\r\nUnited Nations regional structures need to be developed\r\nfurther in order to prevent and solve crises. Today the\r\ngrowing scale and volume of arms sales, especially in our\r\nregion, are a cause of great concern.\r\nMany countries do not even make a secret of the fact\r\nthat arms sales have become for them one of the main and\r\nbasic sources of foreign currency, and they pay no attention\r\nwhatsoever to the question of who these arms will be aimed\r\nat tomorrow and what purposes they will be used for.\r\nThe situation in which the same interests are pursued\r\nthrough projects for selling nuclear technologies, even\r\nthough they are accompanied by declarations of peaceful\r\nintentions, is of even greater concern. Uzbekistan advocates\r\nproviding appropriate international guarantees on the non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the\r\nearliest possible conclusion of the comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty.\r\nWe cannot agree with the rhetoric now ringing out\r\nhere and there which is designed to take us back to military\r\nand political confrontation and conflict between blocs. For\r\nus, isolation is very destructive. The only right path for us\r\nis integration into the world community, despite the fact\r\nthat we see certain difficulties and shortcomings in this\r\nprocess.\r\nToday the newly independent States on the post-\r\nSoviet space are in the process of laying the foundations\r\nof their national statehood and advancing towards\r\ndemocratic reform, for which they need the assistance and\r\nsupport of the world community to implement reforms\r\nand expedite their integration into international political,\r\neconomic and financial structures. I mean not only\r\nmaterial and financial assistance but also, and above all,\r\nthe moral and political support we need for our sovereign\r\nand independent development. It is now of crucial\r\nimportance for us to further maintain the consistency and\r\nirreversibility of reform, adherence to democratization and\r\na free market economy, stability and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, and mutually beneficial and equal relations\r\nwith all peace-loving states. This will enable us to secure\r\nthe place we deserve in the world community.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Uzbekistan for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Islam A. Karimov, President of\r\nthe Republic of Uzbekistan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy, President\r\nof the Republic of Paraguay, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Wasmosy (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIt is a privilege for me to represent my country, Paraguay,\r\nas President of the Republic, at this commemoration\r\ntoday of the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. It is also a great\r\nhonour for me to be part of this historic moment in the\r\nlife of the United Nations, since Paraguay was one of the\r\nfounders of the Organization.\r\nParaguay has the same fervour and conviction today\r\nabout the United Nations as it had when it signed the\r\nCharter, and it continues to support the Organization with\r\na view to its pursuing its two main aims: the preservation\r\nand maintenance of peace in the world, and the\r\nconstruction of peace on the basis of the harmonious and\r\nbalanced development of the Member States. Our firm\r\nbelief in the ideals of the United Nations and our support\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nare not shaken or destroyed by some failures which the\r\nUnited Nations may have suffered. We restate our\r\nconviction that this Organization is absolutely necessary in\r\nour world to carry out the two fundamental tasks the\r\npeoples of the United Nations undertook to accomplish after\r\nthe butchery of the Second World War.\r\nParaguay solemnly pledges to continue to support the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter and, in so doing, we\r\ngive our full support to and have every confidence in the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Mr.\r\nPresident, you can be certain that Paraguay has honoured\r\nand will continue to honour its commitments with regard to\r\nthe United Nations. Together, we have travelled a long road\r\nfor 50 years and today we see with great satisfaction that\r\nthe objectives for which this world Organization was\r\nestablished are being reached, although perhaps not as\r\nquickly as we would like.\r\nOur growing experience, the increasing resolve of\r\nStates to preserve peace, and the increasingly ardent desire\r\nof each and every State to make progress, to develop and\r\nto seek higher living standards for their peoples spur us on\r\nto strengthen this Organization, which stands at the head of\r\na system that covers every human activity.\r\nAll States are duty-bound to support and contribute to\r\nthe financing of the United Nations. Failure to lend the\r\nsupport it needs to be able to work towards its aims is\r\ninconceivable. States, large and small, have the same\r\nobligation to make available to the United Nations the\r\nmeans it needs to reach its goals. Paraguay is up-to-date\r\nwith its obligations.\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay has been an enthusiastic and\r\ndevoted participant when called on to act in various organs\r\nof the United Nations. We have also received since 1951\r\nconsiderable technical cooperation, which we deeply\r\nappreciate, and we hope that it will continue since it is an\r\nimportant factor in the development of our countries.\r\nOur Organization has played and continues to play a\r\nprimary role in the world as a guiding light in questions of\r\ngreat importance in the life of nations, such as the\r\nmonumental task of ensuring adherence to the principles of\r\nthe protection of human rights, decolonization, support for\r\ndemocracy and freedom, the legal equality of States, the\r\ncodification of international law — a shining example of\r\nwhich is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea — and many other principles that are now accepted\r\npursuant to multilateral treaties.\r\nAt this time, Paraguay enjoys full democracy, with\r\ntotal freedom and respect for human rights. This political\r\nsituation emerged after a long period of obscurantism,\r\nwhich, fortunately, was cast aside following free elections\r\nthat brought to the presidency after almost 50 years a\r\ncivilian who is committed to consolidating this democracy\r\nand to the ideals and principles of the national\r\nConstitution in force.\r\nParaguay accepts international law as part of its\r\nnational legislation and recognizes international justice as\r\nthe highest instance for the peaceful solution of conflicts.\r\nThus, Paraguay has acted as mediator in the settlement of\r\ndisputes and has often had recourse to international\r\ntribunals in regard to international conflicts and received\r\njudgements in its favour.\r\nParaguay, at the invitation of the President of the\r\nfiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly,\r\nProfessor Diogo Freitas do Amaral, and in keeping with\r\nits steadfast devotion to peace, has decided to make\r\nanother contribution to ending the scourge of war and to\r\ncooperate in the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nFor those reasons, and inspired by the lofty ideals of\r\nthe United Nations, I have the honour to announce to the\r\nAssembly my Government’s decision to recognize as\r\ncompulsory, in relation to any other State accepting the\r\nsame obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal\r\ndisputes, as set forth in Article 36, paragraph 2, of the\r\nCourt’s Statute.\r\nThe relevant declaration will be formalized and\r\ndeposited in accordance with the provisions of Article 36,\r\nparagraph 4, of the Statute of the Court, once the\r\nparliamentary steps required by my country’s Constitution\r\nhave been complied with.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that this decision to\r\nrecognize mankind’s highest Court is the result of prior\r\nconsultation and has the blessing of my country’s\r\nprincipal political entities. Paraguay wishes to renew its\r\nfaith in the law as a part of the new stage in human\r\ncivilization.\r\nThus, armed with the Charter, we will overcome our\r\nproblems and reaffirm our principles, and, with\r\nimagination and courage, we will finally achieve the more\r\njust international society that was conceived 50 years ago\r\nby men and women who believed it worth while to\r\nstruggle to attain freedom.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Juan Carlos Wasmosy, President\r\nof the Republic of Paraguay, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-\r\nJaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Highness Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber\r\nAl-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait.\r\nHis Highness Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-\r\nSabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nSheik Al-Sabah: I open my remarks by offering to\r\nyou all heartfelt greetings, coupled with my sincere wishes\r\nfor the prosperity of mankind.\r\nOn this solemn occasion marking the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, I\r\nfeel that the peoples of the world, despite their different\r\npersuasions, have come to a virtual consensus that this\r\nworld body does indeed represent a real sanctuary to which\r\nthey have recourse to resolve their disputes and address\r\ntheir concerns. This is especially true when small nations\r\nfall prey to threats by larger dictatorial regimes bent on\r\ndevouring them.\r\nI wish to take this occasion, on behalf of the people of\r\nKuwait, to put on record our acknowledgement of the vital\r\nrole played by the United Nations in backing my country in\r\nthe face of aggression. At this point in time, I hope that the\r\nUnited Nations support will continue until the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions are implemented in full. In this\r\ncontext, I wish to highlight the human tragedy of Kuwaiti\r\nand third-country prisoners who remain held in Iraqi jails.\r\nGlobal confidence in the United Nations system has\r\nbeen on the rise since it has become a beacon of hope for\r\nalleviating and redressing the human suffering caused by\r\naggression and oppression in all their forms and\r\nmanifestations. We trust that the Organization will become\r\neven more effective in confronting mankind’s global\r\nproblems in the coming century. Such a contribution would\r\nindeed consolidate the lofty human values of benevolence,\r\ncooperation and interdependence for the common benefit of\r\nall human beings who yearn for a peaceful and dignified\r\nlife.\r\nThere is no doubt that the aspirations pinned on the\r\nUnited Nations will remain high. If anything, this is yet\r\nanother testimony to the relevance of and confidence in\r\nthis great institution. At the same time, we have to be\r\nrealistic and recognize that the United Nations is not and\r\ncannot be a miracle worker. In order to appreciate the\r\nimmense achievements of the United Nations and their\r\nwider implications, we have to make a fair and balanced\r\nreview not only of its political performance but also of its\r\ndelivery in the areas of development, culture, social\r\naffairs and health, to name but a few. Special mention\r\nshould be made of the services and aid provided by the\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies to the countries of\r\nthe third world.\r\nWe value the input of all cultures in the evolution of\r\nthe parameters of the world envisioned by the founders of\r\nthe United Nations. Meanwhile, we do recognize our due\r\nshare of the historical responsibility for fashioning a\r\ncommunity in which the principles of tolerance,\r\nunderstanding and respect for the rule of law and\r\ninternational treaties reign supreme. This would lead to a\r\nstate of human peace of mind free of the threats of\r\nhegemony, the insanity of bigotry and the fear generated\r\nby war and aggression.\r\nI come here on behalf of Kuwait to express\r\nsentiments of gratitude, to extend congratulations to the\r\nUnited Nations and to reaffirm our commitment to the\r\nprinciples enshrined in its Charter.\r\nWe look forward to a future full of hope and peace,\r\nand we pray to Allah, the Almighty, to help mankind\r\nrealize the human aspirations embodied by the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Amir of the State of\r\nKuwait for his statement.\r\nHis Highness Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-\r\nSabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Joachim Alberto\r\nChissano, President of the Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Joachim Alberto Chissano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Joachim Alberto Chissano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Chissano: The celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations is a landmark in the\r\nhistory of humanity. We celebrate, first and foremost, the\r\nsuccess of the United Nations in saving generations from\r\nthe scourge of war. We celebrate the accession to\r\nindependence of the countries and peoples under colonial\r\ndomination. We celebrate our faith in the principles and\r\nmoral values enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs we celebrate this jubilee, we pay special tribute to\r\nthe founding fathers of the United Nations. Our challenge\r\nfor the next century is to strengthen the United Nations\r\nfurther in order to enable it to deal more efficiently and\r\nvigorously with issues related to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and to promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment, human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nOnly these can ensure a better and safer world for all.\r\nThe reforms of the United Nations system are a\r\nlogical consequence of the increase in the membership of\r\nthe Organization and of the winds of democratization\r\nblowing across the world. The United Nations needs to\r\nupdate itself to meet this reality. This requires innovations,\r\nparticularly in the composition and working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council to make it more representative and\r\ndemocratic, thus allowing greater participation on the part\r\nof developing countries in general, and of Africa in\r\nparticular.\r\nWe are at the dawn of a new era. We have the\r\nresponsibility of making it an era of peace, stability and\r\nsustainable development for humanity as a whole.\r\nDevelopment is the twin sister of peace. There can be no\r\nsustainable development without lasting peace, nor can\r\nthere be a lasting peace without sustainable development.\r\nDevelopment is a basic human right. Consequently, we\r\nhave to adopt common policies towards people-centred\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThose summits and conferences which we have\r\nconvened over the past five years reflect our conscious and\r\ncollective desire and determination to attain the most viable\r\nsolutions to the problems facing humanity. It is our belief\r\nthat the most important element in holding summits and\r\nconferences is the implementation of the decisions\r\ntherefrom.\r\nWhen looking at development as a global issue we\r\nhave to bear in mind the specific conditions and needs of\r\nthe developing countries and take into account the social\r\nand human dimension of development. Conditionalities of\r\ndevelopment aid and financing, particularly by the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, must be based on this reality if we\r\nwant to ensure progress in developing countries.\r\nWe in Mozambique have recently benefited from the\r\nassistance of the United Nations, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the international community at\r\nlarge in putting an end to a devastating war. We highly\r\nappreciate the role played by the United Nations in\r\nsupervising and monitoring the implementation of the\r\nGeneral Peace Agreement for Mozambique, which\r\nculminated in the holding of the first multi-party general\r\nelections, in October 1994.\r\nPeace in Mozambique was made possible by the\r\nfollowing fundamental factors: first, the outstanding\r\npolitical will demonstrated by the parties; secondly, the\r\npositive role played by all segments of society; thirdly,\r\nthe spirit of tolerance and mutual accommodation; and\r\nfourthly, the significant role played by the international\r\ncommunity. Our country considered itself to be an\r\nintegral part of the United Nations operation as a Member\r\nfulfilling its obligation to work for the success of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nOur own experience in Mozambique underlines the\r\nneed for the United Nations to bear in mind that peace-\r\nkeeping forces operate on the basis of consent by the\r\nparties concerned. Therefore they must always act with\r\nimpartiality and in accordance with their mandate.\r\nFurthermore, they must respect and abide by the\r\nprinciples of independence, sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and non-interference, with due regard for each\r\ncountry’s specificities. National institutions must be\r\nrespected and protected.\r\nWith peace today we look to the future with\r\noptimism and renewed hope. The unflinching will of the\r\nMozambican people to consolidate peace and democracy\r\nmust be complemented by the creation of adequate\r\nconditions for rebuilding the socio-economic fabric\r\nseverely affected by 16 years of war. As a measure of\r\npost-conflict peace-building we would like to stress the\r\nvital role of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity at large in assisting countries emerging from\r\nconflict situations, particularly in supporting programmes\r\nfor the rehabilitation of their economies and social\r\ninfrastructures.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nIn conclusion, I should like on behalf of the\r\nMozambican people and Government to express our highest\r\nappreciation of the positive role played by the United\r\nNations in international relations during the 50 years of its\r\nexistence and to reiterate our firm commitment to the\r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Mozambique for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul\r\nGayoom, President of the Republic of Maldives\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Abdul Gayoom: On this historic occasion\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, I convey\r\nto you, Mr. President, and all Member States of the United\r\nNations sincere greetings from the people of the Maldives.\r\nGiven only five minutes to speak, one has to be brief\r\nand focus on only a few of the most crucial issues that\r\nhave a direct bearing on one’s own country. Therefore,\r\nwhat I have to say today may be at variance with what\r\nother speakers have said, or will say, on this occasion.\r\nFor the Maldives, a small island nation, our top\r\npriorities are our security, our independence and the basic\r\nneeds of our people.\r\nFifty years ago, the United Nations was created to\r\nserve all peoples — rich and poor alike; big and small on\r\nan equal footing — based on the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of all its Members. My question is this: has the\r\nUnited Nations been successful in the even-handed\r\napplication of this principle and, more particularly, has the\r\nUnited Nations succeeded in ensuring the protection and\r\nsecurity of small States?\r\nJust a few weeks ago, a band of foreign mercenaries\r\ninvaded another island nation, the Comoros, and toppled its\r\nlegitimate Government. I did not hear of any United\r\nNations action. In November 1988 heavily armed foreign\r\nterrorists attacked my own country and tried to do the\r\nsame. We received no assistance from the United Nations\r\nto repel the attack. Following that traumatic experience,\r\nthe Maldives raised the issue of the vulnerability of small\r\nStates to external threats and foreign intervention, which\r\nled to the adoption of the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions.\r\nWe do acknowledge what the United Nations did in\r\nthe Middle East in 1956 and 1967, and in Kuwait in\r\n1991. We want the United Nations to react with the same\r\nurgency, commitment and effectiveness to the threats that\r\nwe small States are frequently exposed to. The security\r\nand protection of small States must be accepted as an\r\nintegral part of international security and peace.\r\nThe coming into force of the International\r\nConvention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and\r\nTraining of Mercenaries would contribute immensely to\r\nthe strengthening of international security. Regrettably,\r\nhowever, though the Convention was adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1989, only nine Member States have\r\nso far ratified it. I therefore urge all Member States which\r\nhave not done so to ratify the Convention as a matter of\r\npriority.\r\nThe latest scientific research indicates that the global\r\ntemperature may increase by as much as 6° Fahrenheit by\r\nthe year 2100 and that consequently the oceans may rise\r\nby as much as one metre or more during the next century.\r\nMy people want to know what the United Nations will do\r\nto save the Maldives and other small island nations from\r\nbeing engulfed by the sea. Indeed, the small island\r\nnations are most susceptible to the dangers of\r\nenvironmental crises as well, especially those due to\r\nclimate change and sea-level rise. Unless the\r\nindustrialized countries drastically cut down the emission\r\nof greenhouse gases, with immediate effect, the small\r\nisland States and other low-lying areas will face an\r\nenvironmental catastrophe of unprecedented proportions.\r\nThe achievements of the United Nations in the past\r\n50 years have been many. Through its decolonization\r\nefforts, more than 100 independent nations have come\r\ninto being. Apartheid has been dismantled. Human rights\r\nand good governance have acquired high priority. The\r\nrights of women have gained ascendancy worldwide.\r\nMeasures relating to youth development and child welfare\r\nhave become key components of national and\r\ninternational social programmes.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nDespite these gains, the issues of the social and\r\neconomic development of many countries have remained\r\nextremely critical. The evils of drug abuse and terrorism\r\nplague our lives. The unsustainable management of the\r\nworld’s natural resources and the rapid deterioration of the\r\nEarth’s environment have become problems of global\r\nmagnitude. It is imperative that the United Nations take\r\ntimely action to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourges not only of war, but of these new dangers as well.\r\nWe are about to enter a new millennium in\r\ncircumstances vastly changed from those of the time when\r\nthe United Nations was born. Today the world needs an\r\nOrganization that will aim at a world of shared economic\r\nprosperity and national security and one in which\r\ncommunities can live in harmony with one another and with\r\nthe environment.\r\nThe United Nations is here to stay. We owe it to the\r\ncoming generations to keep the flame burning and light up\r\nhumanity’s path to a brighter future in a more equitable\r\nworld.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Maldives for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina, President\r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Reina (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nUnited Nations is completing 50 years of existence on the\r\nthreshold of a new century and a new millennium, which\r\nmeans we have a twofold obligation: to think about both\r\nthe work done by the Organization in that period and the\r\nchallenges of the years ahead. Balancing the books and\r\nconsidering prospects are the obligatory tasks of this\r\nanniversary.\r\nThe world that emerged from the Second World War\r\ndid not live up to the dreams of the victorious peoples, and\r\nit still has not done so. No sooner had the flames of\r\ncombat been extinguished than that special sort of\r\nstruggle known as the cold war began, dividing the planet\r\ninto adversarial spheres of influence. The Organization\r\nwas born between fear and hope. None the less, it was the\r\nbest idea of modern times and the best option for the\r\npeace and prosperity of peoples.\r\nThe world body has continued to grow throughout\r\nthese 50 long years. Today it is a great family of\r\ndepartments and agencies whose vast network of\r\ncompetences and activities covers mankind’s most\r\nimportant focuses of concern. Its work in the field of\r\ndevelopment shows how gravely peace is affected by the\r\nseparation between developed and developing countries\r\nand the persistent inequity in the distribution of wealth\r\nbetween the tightly knit circle of affluence and the large\r\ncircle of marginalization and poverty.\r\nThe poor of the world have a right to expect this\r\nplanetary forum to spectacularly light up the path to\r\njustice and well-being. At present, the way for States,\r\nparticularly the poorest States, to follow that path is by\r\nmaking economic readjustments in order to find and\r\nperfect models selected for their correspondence with the\r\nmaterial values of the industrialized societies. This\r\nparadigm is inadequate. No country in the world can\r\nspeak of progress while the great majority of peoples\r\nsuffer from hunger and thirst for justice, however\r\ndifferent might be the abstract reality reflected by\r\nmacroeconomic indicators.\r\nWe are urged to consider new propositions. But we\r\nare now searching for the human being in development,\r\nthe spirit in the meshing of gears, a fellow man who\r\nstands here, now, and who cannot now or ever be\r\nrepresented by the gross national product or per capita\r\nincome. What really matters is not the civilization of\r\ncapital, but the culture that system can engender if it\r\nremembers that the tool is less important than the hand\r\nthat moves it. This woman, this man and this child are the\r\ntrue centre of our concerns, and not a number lost in the\r\nvague dimension of surveys and averages.\r\nThe United Nations must help us find the humanism\r\nof our times. As if in a new Renaissance, we must erect\r\na heretofore unseen concept of man on the shoulders of\r\nscience and technology, a concept by which the\r\nimportance of material things is found in their relationship\r\nwith the higher levels of humanitarian conscience. This\r\nroad begins by vanquishing poverty, defeating illegitimate\r\npower, breaking corruption and impunity and establishing\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\na world order loved and sustained by all. There is no better\r\ndefinition of a future democracy.\r\nIn Central America we are working on a\r\ncomprehensive agenda of development in which political,\r\neconomical, social, cultural and environmental issues\r\nreceive equal attention, given the multidimensional\r\ncharacter of the human being. We started an alliance for\r\nsustained development, and we want the rest of the world\r\nto participate in order to exemplify a new understanding of\r\nthe relations between the peoples of the United Nations.\r\nMy country, the Republic of Honduras, is pledged to\r\ncarrying out a genuine moral revolution and a national\r\nconvergence process leading to a Government by\r\nconsensus. Thus, we shall enter the new century in a new\r\nway in order to bury for ever the vices and errors of the\r\npast. We are convinced that the United Nations, this\r\nalliance of the peoples of the world, will enter the second\r\nhalf of its first century with a renewed spirit of humanism,\r\nsolidarity and full conviction that respect for the legitimate\r\nwill of peoples is the sturdiest foundation for peace, that\r\ndesideratum of the new United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Honduras for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina, President\r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Václav Havel, President\r\nof the Czech Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Václav Havel, President of\r\nthe Czech Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Václav Havel, President of the\r\nCzech Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Havel: Allow me a few words about my\r\nvision of the United Nations in the twenty-first century.\r\nI am deeply convinced that the primeval foundations\r\nof the broad spectrum of cultures, spheres of civilization\r\nand worlds of religion which we represent here contain\r\ncertain basic moral principles which are identical to them\r\nall and which offer a key to human coexistence on this\r\nEarth of ours. I am convinced that we all share certain most\r\nprofound experiences with ourselves, with the miracle of\r\nour very existence and with the miracle of the universe of\r\nwhich we are a part. If the future of mankind is not to be\r\njeopardized by conflicting spheres of civilization and\r\nculture, we have no alternative but to shift the ray of our\r\nattention from that which separates us to that which unites\r\nus. This is where I see the only possible source of a new\r\nspirit, of a new ethos of world cooperation, as well as of\r\nhumanity’s renewed responsibility for the world. This,\r\ntoo, is where I sense the only possible spiritual basis of\r\nany future meaningful existence of the United Nations.\r\nSo far, it seems to me, the United Nations has,\r\nabove all, served States and their Governments in\r\nreaching various agreements, but also in their competing\r\ninterests, rivalries and prestige. In my vision, the United\r\nNations of the future would become more clearly an\r\ninstrument serving all inhabitants of our planet, an\r\ninstrument for pursuing their good life together. The point\r\nis not to expropriate any part of their internal\r\nidentification with their own country, their people, their\r\nreligious or cultural roots. The point is to forge a world\r\nin which everyone could be himself without being\r\nmenaced by another, in which we would all feel that there\r\nare values which we all share and whose protection and\r\nnurturing are in the interest of us all. The form of a\r\ntwenty-first century United Nations could be shaped\r\nprecisely by this spirit, by this sense of responsibility.\r\nI have a vision of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly one day resembling a parliament of the world.\r\nI have a vision of the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil assuming additional tasks. One day, it might\r\nbecome the focal point for the operational decision-\r\nmaking of this world Organization on all basic issues that\r\nconcern it. Its permanent members, their composition\r\nbetter balanced than now, should one day include the\r\nmost populous and most influential countries of the world,\r\nrepresenting different continents and spheres of\r\ncivilization, indeed even certain integrated groups of\r\nStates pursuing a joint foreign policy.\r\nI have a vision of the United Nations one day\r\nestablishing a permanent strike force capable of stopping\r\naggressors, as well as a permanent peace-keeping force,\r\nwith more of a policing role.\r\nI have a vision of the United Nations of the twenty-\r\nfirst century dealing only with matters that no one else\r\ncan deal with, and only with matters it can really affect.\r\nFor quite a few of the issues it takes on today could\r\nprobably be better dealt with by other global or regional\r\norganizations. All the more effectively and flexibly would\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nthe United Nations then deal with those issues that truly do\r\npertain to it. This is connected with another major topic:\r\nstreamlining the United Nations bureaucracy. I believe that\r\nthe simpler its structure and the more independent and\r\nresponsible its staff, the less it would actually cost us all.\r\nAnd, indeed, who should pay for it? Ideally, difficult\r\nthough it is to imagine today, all citizens of this planet\r\nmight one day contribute, as directly as possible, some\r\nminuscule portion of their income to make it quite obvious\r\nthat this is an Organization humankind established for itself\r\nrather than strictly the domain of professional diplomats\r\nserving various Governments.\r\nThese few sentences should make it clear that my\r\nvision of the United Nations in the next century is not one\r\nof a monstrous superstate, a burden to all, but on the\r\ncontrary, a vision of a flexible and workmanlike instrument\r\nof service to all, infused by a common will to benefit\r\nmankind as a whole.\r\nLet me sum up. Mine is a vision of a United Nations\r\nconsisting not, as happens so frequently today, of divided\r\nnations and in particular of divided States, but of united\r\npeople belonging to a world in jeopardy which can be\r\nsaved only by uniting all human forces.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Czech\r\nRepublic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Václav Havel, President of the\r\nCzech Republic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Árpád Göncz, President\r\nof the Republic of Hungary\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Árpád Göncz, President of\r\nthe Republic of Hungary.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Árpád Göncz, President of the\r\nRepublic of Hungary, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Göncz: It is an honour and privilege for me\r\nto participate in this Commemorative Meeting.\r\nDuring the 50 years of its existence, the United\r\nNations has upheld the noble ideals and values embodied in\r\nthe Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\r\nother important United Nations instruments. These ideals\r\nand values are even now a major driving force behind the\r\nmomentous changes in our contemporary world.\r\nWe should not forget that the strengths and\r\nweaknesses or the accomplishments and failures of the\r\nOrganization are our common responsibility. In this\r\nrespect, the vision of the founding fathers “to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war” remains\r\nto be pursued vigorously for all of us.\r\nFor so many in the world, the United Nations is a\r\nbeacon of hope and help. We, ourselves, felt this when,\r\nin 1956, Hungarians in our revolution and national-\r\nfreedom fight, including myself, took courage from the\r\ndistant but clear voice of solidarity coming from this very\r\nHall. We remain deeply grateful for that. The continued\r\nattention of the United Nations was instrumental in the\r\nimprovement of our fate, including that of the prisoners\r\nof conscience.\r\nMr. Silpa-Archa (Prime Minister of Thailand), Vice-\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, took the Chair.\r\nSmall countries, like Hungary, sought and found in\r\nthe United Nations a forum where they could articulate\r\nand defend their interests and act in unison with all\r\nnations. Thus they could contribute to the shaping of a\r\nbetter future. We have learned — maybe well before\r\nothers — that by upholding universal values, supporting\r\nthe ideals set forth in the Charter 50 years ago and acting\r\nfor their practical implementation, we not only do not lose\r\nour specific identity but also enrich the precious political\r\nheritage of mankind.\r\nWe live in a time of opportunities, and the United\r\nNations is at a crossroads. Only a reformed United\r\nNations can be a catalyst in our endeavours to create a\r\nsafe and secure world, where freedom, democracy and\r\nrespect for human rights flourish. We should redouble our\r\nefforts to revitalize the United Nations. To this effect,\r\nthere can be no delay in restructuring and streamlining the\r\ncostly bureaucracy of the United Nations system. We\r\nhave to rationalize the work of the General Assembly.\r\nEnlargement of the Security Council, along with\r\nenhancement of its effectiveness, is more than necessary.\r\nFinancial reform of the United Nations is a must.\r\nThe time has come for a revitalized multilateral\r\nmentality to meet effectively and firmly the challenge of\r\nthe new global and interconnected threats of resurgent\r\nnationalism and ethnic strife, international terrorism, illicit\r\ndrug-trafficking, the smuggling of nuclear materials, the\r\ndeliberate degradation of the global environment and\r\npoverty.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nBy the same token, international protection of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms — including minority\r\nrights — sustained economic growth, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the promotion of prosperity should be\r\nhigh priorities for us well into the next century.\r\nIt is in this connection that I should like to pay tribute\r\nin particular to the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency as shining examples\r\nof multilateral thinking at its best.\r\nAt this important juncture of history, our task is to\r\ndevelop and strengthen a genuinely worldwide constituency\r\nfor the United Nations. We can do this only if we make\r\nevery effort to involve the young generations, whose\r\nconfidence must be won through a renewed philosophy of\r\nmultilateral cooperation. I am confident that for generations\r\nto come the promotion and protection of multi-ethnicity,\r\ndiversity, tolerance and respect for human dignity will be\r\nthe major feature what is expected of the United Nations.\r\nThe next era of the United Nations is being shaped\r\ntoday by our ideas and actions. I am profoundly convinced\r\nthat our common wisdom, courage and determination will\r\nmake the United Nations indeed worthy of the heritage\r\ngiven to us by our forefathers, who laid the foundation of\r\nthis truly unique Organization 50 years ago.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Hungary for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Árpád Göncz, President of the\r\nRepublic of Hungary, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Eduardo Frei Ruiz-\r\nTagle, President of the Republic of Chile\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Frei Ruiz-Tagle (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am honoured to bring to the General Assembly\r\na message from the Government and people of Chile on the\r\noccasion of this celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe preservation of humanity requires our gratitude,\r\nand today I reflect upon all those women and men who\r\nhave contributed to the development of the United\r\nNations. I also pay homage to all the anonymous\r\nheroes — civilians and unknown solders — who gave\r\ntheir lives for peace and development.\r\nTo respond to global changes the United Nations has\r\ntruly had to explore a vast array of fields of knowledge\r\nand to resolve myriad controversies between nations and\r\npeoples. The United Nations has strengthened\r\ninternational law in a wide variety of areas. It has helped\r\nto prevent the spread of wars, it has contributed to the\r\nsettlement of disputes between North and South, and it\r\nhas played a key role in the process of decolonization in\r\nAsia and Africa.\r\nIt has also strengthened international cooperation. It\r\nhas fostered the creation of an open framework for trade,\r\ninvestment, the transfer of technology and environmental\r\nprotection and has created an opportunity for links\r\nbetween nations with regard to debt and the financing of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations has made an extraordinary\r\ncontribution to the promotion and preservation of human\r\nrights and, thereby, to the theory and practice of\r\ndemocracy. This universal consolidation of the creed of\r\nhuman rights is truly humanity’s greatest contribution to\r\nthe twentieth century and its most precious gift to future\r\ngenerations.\r\nIs it not perhaps time to suggest new tasks for the\r\nUnited Nations? I pose this as a question, with the\r\nunpretentiousness of a young, emerging nation.\r\nIn the area of peace, I believe that the Organization\r\nshould strengthen its capabilities in preventive diplomacy,\r\nimplement a complete ban on nuclear testing — we are\r\nready to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, as we do not want continued nuclear\r\ntesting, which is a danger to our countries and to people\r\neverywhere — and it should foster cooperation as a\r\nmeans of bolstering global peace.\r\nIn international law, the United Nations can\r\nencourage progress by ensuring regulatory refinements in\r\nareas critical to social and economic progress: technology,\r\ntransportation, information, humanitarian aid, human\r\nrights and peace-keeping operations.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nIn the area of development and the eradication of\r\npoverty in the world, the fact that one fifth of the world’s\r\npopulation lives in dire poverty demands an urgent response\r\nat the national and global levels. The conditions faced by\r\nwomen, children, vulnerable sectors of the population and\r\nmigrant workers; the new problems of environmental\r\ndeterioration; drug trafficking and consumption; the high\r\nrates of mortality and pandemic diseases; the different\r\nforms of social ostracism and exclusion — these things\r\nmake it morally and politically imperative to establish new\r\npriorities for the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nUp to now the United Nations has been the setting for\r\nintergovernmental agreement. It is now time to begin the\r\nlong march towards the consolidation of ties between the\r\npeoples and groups of different societies. The exchange of\r\ncultural values in civil society can provide an important\r\nsource of support for the elimination of apprehensions,\r\nracism and prejudice against human conditions of all types.\r\nFurthermore, contacts between people and the exchange of\r\ngoods and services in certain areas of the world underpin\r\ndifferent forms of political and economic integration\r\nspiritually and materially.\r\nWe believe that the future of the United Nations must\r\nbe marked by emphasis on human development,\r\npreservation of the environment and the consolidation of\r\npeace. This will require adjustment of the process of\r\nreforming the Organization towards these objectives. Chile\r\nis fully prepared to contribute to the implementation of\r\nthese worthy goals, in keeping with its tradition of\r\ndemocracy and solidarity.\r\nThe coming millennium should be a time for the\r\nemergence of a world which expresses its broadest\r\ndiversity, with peoples living in peaceful unity and feeling\r\nat home. Will we be capable of making the world a true\r\nhome for mankind? That is the noble task before us all, and\r\nit is up to us to achieve this goal in the third millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Chile for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Carlos Saúl Menem,\r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Carlos Saúl Menem,\r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Saúl Menem, President of\r\nthe Argentine Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Menem (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nFifty years have elapsed since the unspeakable pain and\r\nsuffering of a terrible war gave rise to the United Nations.\r\nToday, we are celebrating much more than an\r\nanniversary. We evoke the dream, the vision, the fears\r\nand also the courage of a few men who, despite the\r\nproximity of horror, dared to imagine a space for the\r\npreservation of international peace and security,\r\ninternational cooperation, the promotion of human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms and the economic and social\r\nprogress of peoples. This generation — our generation —\r\nowes the founding fathers of the United Nations its\r\ndeepest gratitude.\r\nI convey the message of a people which, from the\r\nsouth of the Americas, has accompanied the United\r\nNations since its earliest years. I am the bearer of a new\r\ncommitment, a renewed promise from Argentina, filled\r\nwith hope and free from speculation. Our participation in\r\npeace-keeping operations and observation and\r\nhumanitarian-assistance missions proves that Argentines\r\nhave faith in multilateralism and in our Organization.\r\nWe note with genuine satisfaction that the\r\nOrganization is deeply committed to solving the major\r\ninternational conflicts, but also to responding to\r\nhumanitarian emergencies and tirelessly promoting respect\r\nand tolerance. Almost imperceptibly, the voices which\r\nuntil recently foretold the decline of multilateralism are\r\nfading away. The United Nations has proven them\r\ncategorically wrong by taking the lead in the creation of\r\nnew patterns of international social coexistence.\r\nThese positive developments are not, however, the\r\nonly aspects of the reality that we must confront. The law\r\nof violence is still imposed in more areas of the planet\r\nthan we should like to admit. Hunger, helplessness and\r\nintolerance afflict many thousands, demanding solutions\r\nthat are not always forthcoming. This constantly reminds\r\nus of the need to strengthen our efforts, stimulate our\r\nimagination and increase the material resources available\r\nto the Organization in order to find a response to these\r\npredicaments that should be as immediate as it is unified.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nA few days ago, from this very rostrum, His Holiness\r\nPope John Paul II rightly reaffirmed that our task consists\r\nnot merely of serving by\r\n“effective mediation for the resolution of conflicts, but\r\nalso by fostering ... concrete initiatives of solidarity”.\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 20th meeting, p. 5)\r\nIn this context, I have created the White Helmets\r\nCommission with the aim of mobilizing resources, by\r\nmeans of a volunteer system, to support the United Nations\r\nin its activities in the fields of emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance and the promotion of a gradual transition from\r\nrelief to rehabilitation, reconstruction and development. We\r\nhave made this specific contribution in the field of\r\ndevelopment because we know that the scope of the United\r\nNations is not and cannot be restricted to the great security\r\nissues on the daily agenda of the Security Council, no\r\nmatter how urgent and pressing those issues may be.\r\nFor an organization like the United Nations, half a\r\ncentury of existence may seem like a long time. From its\r\ninception to the present, international circumstances have\r\nchanged dramatically, from the emergence of nuclear\r\nweapons through the decolonization process to the\r\nbeginning and the end of the cold war. In the presence of\r\nsuch an evolving and dynamic reality, questions and doubts\r\nas to the functioning of the Organization and the possible\r\nreform of its institutions and machinery begin to arise. The\r\nmomentum towards reform, which represents the impulse\r\nfor change and progress, must in this case be managed on\r\na realistic and practical basis so as not to alter the delicate\r\nbalance achieved after such painstaking work in San\r\nFrancisco 50 years ago.\r\nNowadays a new atmosphere prevails, conducive to\r\nthe attainment of a United Nations capable of ensuring\r\npeace and active in the promotion of economic and social\r\nprogress. This new scenario will also enable us to make\r\nstrides in the multilateral consideration of such new threats\r\nto peace and security as international terrorism, drug\r\ntrafficking and illicit arms transfers. Because of their\r\ncomplexity and persistence, all these threats require\r\ncoordinated and global action, which is possible only\r\nthrough the United Nations. The opportunity is here and\r\nnow and we must make the most of it. We have a simple\r\nchoice to make: either we reaffirm and confirm by deed our\r\ncommitment to the United Nations or we marginalize and\r\nweaken it, thereby opening the door to past scenarios which\r\nshould not be reenacted.\r\nI can imagine a new generation gathered right here\r\nin 50 years’ time, evaluating our actions. Let us begin\r\nnow, through our efforts in the framework of the United\r\nNations, to give specific answers to the questions that our\r\nchildren will undoubtedly raise. This is an appointment\r\nwith history that we cannot and must not avoid.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nArgentine Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Saúl Menem, President of\r\nthe Argentine Republic, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will next hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President\r\nof the Republic of Tajikistan, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Rakhmonov (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nand the half-century that has elapsed since the end of the\r\nSecond World War are historically linked to each other.\r\nThe fight against the forces of evil ended with a\r\ntriumphant victory, having encompassed countries with no\r\nregard to their political system or ideology. We can be\r\nproud that Tajikistan’s warriors and envoys were part of\r\nthose national forces that fought for this victory and\r\nformed the United Nations.\r\nDesigned to help States resolve disputes in a\r\npeaceful manner, the United Nations today faces a new\r\nchallenge: to make wider use of preventive diplomacy for\r\nthose purposes. We believe that the peacemaking potential\r\nof the United Nations can be coupled with its cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations, primarily in deterring,\r\nconfining and settling armed conflicts and in countering\r\nterrorism and radical manifestations of fundamentalism of\r\nvarious kinds. We believe that the best prospects for\r\ndefending our national interests lie in cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and other international\r\norganizations.\r\nThis is the trend that characterizes the inter-Tajik\r\ntalks today, and it is within this framework that they are\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\ntaking place. I am sure that our efforts to this end would be\r\nmore fruitful were it not for the remaining tension in\r\nneighbouring Afghanistan. The trend towards escalation of\r\nthe conflict there not only threatens our country’s security,\r\nbut bears the destructive impulses of a global crisis. We\r\ncall upon the international community to promote the\r\nearliest return of peace to this long-suffering land.\r\nOvercoming the Afghan crisis requires not only the\r\nconstructive participation of States in the region, but also\r\neffective action by the United Nations.\r\nThe problem of the economic development of young\r\nMember States is closely linked to issues of international\r\nsecurity. We believe that the remaining discriminatory\r\nrestrictions in world economy and trade, as well as the\r\npractice of conditional financial and economic assistance to\r\ncountries with transitional economies clearly do not serve\r\nthe purposes of achieving universal security. The\r\ndevelopment by specialized agencies and by international\r\nbanking and financial organizations of a comprehensive\r\nplan supporting reforms in countries of the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States (CIS) during the transition period\r\nwould, in our opinion, significantly expedite the integration\r\nof these States into the world economy.\r\nThe turbulent development of today’s world is pushing\r\nthe United Nations in the direction of reinterpreting quite a\r\nfew of its concepts, objectives and tasks. In this regard, we\r\nare hopeful that the trend of recent years towards\r\nenforcement measures as part of peace-keeping operations\r\nconducted under United Nations auspices will not gain any\r\nfurther momentum. While advocating stronger United\r\nNations positions in ensuring peace and stability, including\r\nin our region, we believe the requirements of security\r\nstandards should be invariable.\r\nOn its fiftieth anniversary, the United Nations has\r\nevery opportunity to find effective answers to questions\r\nposed by qualitative changes in the world situation. One\r\nsuch answer is the streamlining of the United Nations itself,\r\ntaking today’s realities into account. We see the strategy of\r\npartnership in the twenty-first century as one based on\r\nunderlying common interests which will help build trust and\r\nextend the borders of peace and prosperity for years to\r\ncome.\r\nFive decades are a short moment from the perspective\r\nof history. And they are a moment as beautiful as the very\r\nidea of peace and cooperation that lies at the foundation of\r\nthe United Nations. The festive atmosphere within these\r\nwalls today should not hide the harsh reality of day-to-day\r\nlife. We must properly pass the United Nations heritage to\r\nthe next generation with confidence and with hope for a\r\nbetter future.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President\r\nof the Republic of Tajikistan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Sylvestre\r\nNtibantunganya, President of the Republic of Burundi\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Sylvestre\r\nNtibantunganya, President of the Republic of Burundi.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nPresident Ntibantunganya (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Today, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, I should like to begin by paying a\r\nwell-deserved tribute to all the founders of our\r\nOrganization and by commending the courage and\r\ndedication of all the Secretaries-General who have\r\npresided over the Organization. They all worked in a\r\ntumultuous world, but their actions have been able to\r\nchange the face of that world, especially through\r\ndecolonization, the settlement of a number of regional\r\nconflicts and the emergence of a process of\r\ndemocratization in various political systems. To be sure,\r\nmany alarming problems remain, especially with the\r\ncontinuation of poverty and major displacements of\r\npopulation owing to crises which have caused upheaval in\r\ncertain countries.\r\nWe in the region of the Great Lakes know this well.\r\nMillions of refugees there remind the world that the\r\nsocio-political crisis which has stricken the region must\r\nbe quickly resolved so as to avoid the total catastrophe\r\nthat some have been fearing for several months now, as\r\npolitical, military and economic interests complicate the\r\nissue. The solution we desire cannot be expected only\r\nfrom the international community. We, the sons and\r\ndaughters of this region, must bend our efforts and our\r\ndetermination, and do everything possible, to correct the\r\nheritage of the past without being confused by it.\r\nWe must build a present which is not based on\r\nrevenge for the past. We should also avoid having our\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nfuture compromised by selfishness and by the promotion of\r\nnarrow interests. The African peoples of the Great Lakes\r\nregion have a right to peace, and we, their leaders, must\r\ngive it to them. There is a great deal at stake, and we\r\ncannot risk missing this opportunity.\r\nIn Burundi, we have just experienced two years of\r\ncrisis since the vile assassination of the first democratically\r\nelected Head of State in our history. Since then, given a\r\npast marked by indescribable political violence, my country\r\nhas become a concern not only to its neighbours in Africa\r\nbut also to the entire international community. How could\r\nit be otherwise when we know that the various crises which\r\nhave stricken Burundi have always posed serious security,\r\nenvironmental, and even social and political problems for\r\nour neighbours. All of this is the result of a great deal of\r\nsocial, ethnic and political interference that has marked our\r\nborder populations.\r\nLike our neighbouring countries, the international\r\ncommunity has been afraid that Burundi might explode and\r\nmeet the same fate as that which neighbouring Rwanda did\r\nin 1994. There has already been a clash of arms, but if\r\neveryone — that is, we in Burundi, our neighbours and the\r\ninternational community — shows the necessary\r\ndetermination, the danger might be averted.\r\nTo my compatriots I say “no” to the bloody rivalry\r\nwhich kills, rapes, destroys, ravages, pillages and sets fire.\r\nI say “no” to the denial of the rights of others for any\r\nreason. I say “no” to intolerance, and to disobedience to\r\nauthority and to the public order established by consent of\r\nthe people.\r\nOn the other hand, I say “yes” to mutual trust, to\r\nsecurity for all and to a common and shared peace. I say\r\n“yes” to freedom, to respect for individual rights and to\r\nprogress for all.\r\nTo achieve this, only one condition must be met: the\r\nvarious Burundian military and political protagonists must\r\nguarantee peace to each other and to all the people of\r\nBurundi. Once security is assured, the national debate can\r\nproceed in full serenity and lead Burundi to equip itself\r\nwith new instruments of governance consistent with\r\nuniversally recognized democratic principles and the\r\ninherent realities of the country.\r\nIn so doing, we expect from our neighbours and from\r\nthe international community the following. First, to put an\r\nend, once and for all, to the disorderly flow of arms that\r\ncirculate in the subregion and serve extremists of all kinds.\r\nSecondly, to monitor and block the routes used for entry\r\nand operations by the bands, militias and armed groups\r\nthat are killing, pillaging and setting fires in virtually all\r\nparts of my country. Thirdly, to locate and destroy the\r\nmedia that are spreading hatred and death, such as “Radio\r\nDémocratie”, and to hunt down both the organizers and\r\nthose behind them. And fourthly, to help Burundi in its\r\nprogramme of moral and physical reconstruction,\r\nespecially in the legal and educational spheres and in the\r\nresettlement and reintegration of displaced persons,\r\nrepatriates and refugees, together with relaunching the\r\neconomic and social development of the country.\r\nSpecial emphasis must be placed in the immediate\r\nfuture on the work of the International Commission of\r\nInquiry, which should quickly begin its work and shed\r\nlight on the circumstances in which President Melchior\r\nNdadaye was assassinated on 21 October 1993, and on\r\nthe situation that prevailed immediately after his\r\nassassination, in particular during the subsequent inter-\r\nethnic massacres.\r\nThe United Nations cannot effectively assist our\r\ncountries unless it adapts to the requirements of today’s\r\nworld. Peace in the world is still endangered by growing\r\npoverty, which is evidently the gravest threat to peace in\r\nthe years to come. Moreover, the exclusion of a major\r\nportion of humankind from the most influential bodies of\r\nthe United Nations gives the impression of a world that\r\nis frozen in time, whereas important changes have taken\r\nplace over the past 50 years. We must transform and\r\ndemocratize international relations as a whole. Today, the\r\nworld and its citizens demand equality, fraternity and\r\nshared development.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency General Idriss Deby,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chad\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by His Excellency General Idriss Deby,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chad.\r\nHis Excellency General Idriss Deby, President of the\r\nRepublic of Chad, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nPresident Deby (interpretation from French): The\r\nceremony we have been attending for two days now is a\r\nspecial occasion, because it marks an important turning\r\npoint for our Organization. Indeed, a half-century ago,\r\nimmediately following the war, some 50 nations laid the\r\nfoundations for a system of society turned resolutely\r\ntowards freedom, peace, collective security, and economic\r\nand social well-being. Today these aspirations remain\r\ntopical and deserve the support of all. Chad, for its part,\r\nsolemnly reaffirms its full commitment to these noble ideals\r\nand its determination to deploy every effort for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nWhile it is true that the world, over the years, has seen\r\nmany upheavals and often-deadly conflicts that have\r\nresulted in sometimes severe criticism of our Organization,\r\nwe must acknowledge that in many cases the United\r\nNations has achieved substantial results and has spared\r\nhumanity the worst of catastrophes.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIt has played a decisive role in such varied areas as\r\ndecolonization, the codification of the rules of international\r\nlaw, and the maintenance and restoration of peace. Our\r\nOrganization has also endeavoured to face the major\r\nchallenges of the end of this century, among them the\r\nprotection of the environment and issues pertaining to\r\npopulation and sustainable development. Therefore the\r\nUnited Nations, in our view, remains an irreplaceable\r\ninstrument for solving the problems that preoccupy our\r\nworld.\r\nDespite the outstanding efforts made by our\r\nOrganization, there remain causes for concern. This is true\r\nin particular for such important initiatives as international\r\ndevelopment strategies and the establishment of a new\r\ninternational economic order, which have gone unheeded.\r\nThe same applies to the disarmament process, certain\r\naspects of which provoke serious worries.\r\nConflicts continue to ravage certain parts of the world,\r\nwhile hunger, extreme poverty and major endemic diseases\r\nare far from being eradicated from the face of the Earth.\r\nMany dangers, such as terrorism, drug trafficking and\r\nintolerance of all kinds, are threatening the very foundations\r\nof our society.\r\nThe need to adapt the United Nations to a changing\r\nworld is evident, as has been made clear by the many\r\nspeakers here who have quite rightly supported a\r\nrestructuring of its various bodies so that the Organization\r\ncan meet the expectations of nations today. Its ever-\r\nincreasing activities must be accompanied by true political\r\nwill and commensurate financial support in order to make\r\nit an effective tool in the service of peace, solidarity and\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nSince December 1990, Chad has been going through\r\na most enriching democratic process, thereby putting an\r\nend to a long and dark period of implacable dictatorship.\r\nThe enjoyment of freedoms today is a tangible reality.\r\nPolitical parties, trade unions, syndicates, associations for\r\nthe defence of human rights, the press and many other\r\ngroups are carrying out their missions without hindrance\r\nand in complete independence. But apprenticeship to\r\ndemocracy is no easy task.\r\nThrough lack of democratic culture, some political\r\nfigures in Chad have indulged without restraint in\r\ndemagogy, exaggerated statements and manoeuvres of all\r\nkinds, thus creating obstacles to the normal development\r\nof our democratic process, so much so that today Chad is\r\none of the few countries in French-speaking Africa not to\r\nhave organized pluralist elections. The Government,\r\nthrough my voice, undertakes to shoulder its full\r\nresponsibilities in order to bring the democratic process to\r\ncompletion.\r\nWe take this opportunity to appeal urgently, from\r\nthis rostrum, to friendly countries and to all international\r\nbodies to support our efforts to provide our country with\r\npermanent democratic institutions. To be sure, a great\r\ndeal has been accomplished already with their help, and\r\nfor this I should like to thank them here. But the main\r\ntask remains, and it is for this purpose that I ask once\r\nagain for their valuable assistance. I want them to know\r\nhow grateful the people of Chad will be.\r\nIn the same vein, I should like to reiterate, on behalf\r\nof the people and Government of Chad and on my own\r\nbehalf, our gratitude to the United Nations for the crucial\r\nsupport given to our country both for its reconstruction\r\nand for the definitive settlement of the dispute over the\r\nAozou Strip.\r\nThat support remains essential for us. Indeed, Aozou\r\nand the entire northern part of Chad continue to suffer\r\nfrom the consequences of war and from the existence of\r\nmines of all types, neither the quantity nor the location of\r\nwhich are known.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nWe therefore need the help and expertise of the United\r\nNations in mine-clearing in order to rid our land of this\r\nterrible danger.\r\nSimilarly, my Government calls on the Organization\r\nto assist the countries of the Sahel to halt the proliferation\r\nof the weapons of war in that region.\r\nLong live the United Nations; may it hand down from\r\ngeneration to generation its ideals of peace, justice and\r\nsolidarity for the development of nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Chad for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency General Idriss Deby, President of the\r\nRepublic of Chad, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mahamane Ousmane,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Niger\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency Mr.\r\nMahamane Ousmane, President of the Republic of Niger.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahamane Ousmane, President of\r\nthe Republic of Niger, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Mahamane (interpretation from French):\r\nTwenty-fourth October 1945 to 24 October 1995: it has\r\nbeen 50 years since the United Nations was established at\r\nSan Francisco and 50 years that it has been working\r\ntirelessly to build and consolidate a better world, a world of\r\njustice, peace, progress and universal harmony.\r\nAs I convey to this Assembly the warmest greetings\r\nof the people of Niger, I have the pleasure to reaffirm\r\nsolemnly and forcefully Niger’s unyielding allegiance to the\r\nUnited Nations, and its determination to continue forever to\r\nrespect scrupulously the noble principles and ideals of the\r\nCharter.\r\nAs we all know, the paramount reasons for the\r\nexistence of the United Nations are the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and thus the prevention of\r\nall conflicts that could degenerate into war; the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights; the development and\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation; and the struggle\r\nfor the economic and social progress of mankind.\r\nWhatever its detractors may say, and despite the many\r\nobstacles that impede its functioning, we must acknowledge\r\nthat the United Nations has been at the root of striking\r\nqualitative changes on the international scene. It has been\r\nat the centre of the accession to independence of many\r\nhundreds of millions of people. In the sphere of peace-\r\nkeeping, it has somehow managed to prevent the\r\nrepetition of conflicts just as devastating and deadly as\r\nthe war that brought it into being. It continues to be the\r\nbest framework for multidirectional thought and action\r\ntowards a common approach to the ills that beset\r\nmankind, including hunger, disease, ignorance, poverty\r\nand the deterioration of the environment.\r\nWe therefore offer due thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and through him to\r\nall the men and women who continue to sustain the rich,\r\nnoble, proud and legitimate hopes of the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations must continue and\r\ncomplete its quest for universality; it must truly be a\r\nplace where all the peoples of the world can meet and\r\nconsolidate their efforts. Whatever qualifications or claims\r\nsome among us may put forward, we must courageously\r\nacknowledge the intangible realities of the world. Only\r\nthus can we achieve universal peace.\r\nWe are pleased by the significant progress towards\r\npeace in the Middle East and in Palestine, in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and in other parts of the world. These are\r\nthe result in large part of steady efforts by the United\r\nNations, and we encourage the Organization to continue\r\nso that peace may be restored forever in Rwanda,\r\nBurundi, Somalia, Liberia and everywhere else where it\r\nhas been breached or where it is threatened, as in Jammu\r\nand Kashmir and in Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nSimilarly, to encourage this movement towards\r\npeace, the United Nations must continue to speak out and\r\nact throughout the world against the injustice faced by\r\nmillions whose fundamental rights are very often harshly\r\nviolated or totally ignored.\r\nTo remain the conscience of the international\r\ncommunity and to be a moral force that can regulate the\r\nbehaviour of all States, the United Nations must continue\r\nits work towards general and complete disarmament in\r\norder to ensure equal security for all. It must become\r\nmore open and more democratic, which requires an\r\noverhaul of the Charter, inter alia to ensure more\r\nequitable representation of its Members in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nFinally, and above all, the United Nations must be\r\nmore vigorous and resolute in the struggle to eliminate\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nthe destitution and poverty that buffet entire regions of the\r\nworld, the perpetuation of which is one of the greatest of\r\nthreats to peace. In that connection, the situation in Africa,\r\nthat great continent full of resources and vitality, deserves\r\nthe full attention of the international community. In the\r\nlight of these urgent priorities, we must lend strong support\r\nto the programme set out by the Secretary-General in “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” and in its indispensable complement\r\n“An Agenda for Development”, in order to breathe new,\r\nmore hopeful dynamism into the United Nations.\r\nIn my view, these are the requirements of the day.\r\nThis is the generous vision of tomorrow’s world that we\r\nmust offer to the peoples we represent as we strive towards\r\nthe ideals set out by the signatories of the San Francisco\r\nCharter.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe President of the Republic of Niger for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahamane Ousmane, President of\r\nthe Republic of Niger, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of\r\nthe Republic of Cameroon\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency Mr.\r\nPaul Biya, President of the Republic of Cameroon.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cameroon, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Biya (interpretation from French): Allow\r\nme at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you on your election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at a time that I\r\ndo not hesitate to describe as historic. Let me also convey\r\nmy cordial greetings to all the dignitaries present here, and\r\nespecially to the many Heads of State and Heads of\r\nGovernment.\r\nMay I also be permitted to express my sincere and\r\nfraternal appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the unceasing efforts he has made in the\r\nservice of our Organization.\r\nCameroon of course rejoices, as do all other Member\r\nStates, at the opportunity to take part today in the\r\nceremonies that mark the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. I am all the happier to be here at this great\r\nencounter, since my country was a pupil of the United\r\nNations. My compatriots, I can affirm, have not forgotten\r\nthe primary role played by the United Nations in\r\nCameroon’s accession to national and international\r\nsovereignty.\r\nFor us Africans, the United Nations is the expression\r\nof a collective will that is at the service of peace, of\r\nhuman dignity and solidarity among peoples. Created in\r\nthe wake of one of the most harrowing conflicts in the\r\nhistory of mankind, in the last 50 years the United\r\nNations has made an inestimable contribution to the\r\ndefence of peace. In working for disarmament and\r\nencouraging negotiations, it has taken preventive action to\r\nward off possible future conflicts.\r\nAnd when, regrettably, weapons were used, the\r\nUnited Nations offered its good offices. It placed itself\r\nbetween the parties, and the soldiers of peace have often\r\npaid a heavy price in the cause of international security.\r\nWe must also emphasize the action undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations in defence of the rights of the human\r\nperson, particularly in third-world countries. In this\r\nconnection, the United Nations contribution to the\r\nprogressive disappearance of colonialism and the end of\r\napartheid is well known to all.\r\nIf we are to rejoice in the opportunity of peoples to\r\ndecide their own fate we must not forget that the\r\nflourishing of the human person requires first the exercise\r\nof other rights, especially the right to health and to\r\neducation. The work done in this respect by the United\r\nNations specialized agencies is irreplaceable.\r\nFar be it from me to omit mention of the right to\r\ndevelopment, without which our achievements would be\r\nmere illusion. It is, in essence, only the other side of the\r\ncoin, which is the duty of solidarity, the imperative need\r\nfor which was recognized by the United Nations. All the\r\nproblems of the third world — economic crisis, the debt\r\nburden, the inequality of terms of trade and so on — can\r\nbe resolved only by joint action between the industrialized\r\nand developing countries.\r\nIn truth, what we are talking about is a “contract of\r\nsolidarity”, where each party can benefit. It would\r\nundoubtedly be appropriate to add to this duty of\r\nsolidarity, which is inscribed in the texts, a “supplement\r\nof soul” or heart, which might give some hope to\r\nhundreds of millions of people. The peoples of the third\r\nworld would undoubtedly see this as a key contribution to\r\nthat new, fairer world order for which they yearn.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nOn the eve of the third millennium, to what more\r\nexalting task could the United Nations devote itself?\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): I thank\r\nthe President of the Republic of Cameroon for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cameroon, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I should like at this moment to remind\r\nall delegations and all Members of the five-minute limit.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Taha M. Marouf, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Iraq\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Taha Marouf, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Iraq.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Taha M. Marouf, Vice-President\r\nof the Republic of Iraq, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Marouf (interpretation from Arabic): During the\r\npast 50 years of its life, the United Nations has achieved\r\nmemorable successes. It has succeeded in eradicating\r\ncolonialism, in assisting liberation movements and in laying\r\nthe foundations of international law. Based upon a\r\ncomprehensive concept of security, it has tried hard to\r\nstrike a balance among the various components of security\r\nin the political, economic and social fields.\r\nOn the other hand, the cold war situation, whose\r\norigins coincided with the birth of the Organization, cast its\r\nshadow on the United Nations and its activities. The two\r\nsuper-Powers sought to adapt the working methods of the\r\nOrganization in such a manner as to ensure that neither of\r\nthe two would lose the elements of power to the advantage\r\nof the other. This was achieved at the expense of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and the interests of the great\r\nmajority of the Members of the international Organization.\r\nThe era of the cold war also witnessed the eruption of\r\nmany wars, the acceleration of the arms race and the\r\nregression of prospects for the achievement of the economic\r\nand social objectives of the Organization, including\r\nspecifically the objective of comprehensive development,\r\nthus contributing to the widening of the gap between rich\r\nand poor nations and to the creation of new hotbeds of\r\npolitical instability.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, all the grandiose hopes\r\nfor a new era of peace, development and democratic\r\ninternational relations have had to give way to an\r\nemergent unipolarism, whose five years of existence have\r\nwitnessed many armed conflicts, both on the international\r\nand the domestic levels. There began attempts to\r\ndismantle States in the name of freedom of choice. In the\r\neconomic field, the battle of contending interests is being\r\nfought with increasing intensity so as to secure the\r\nconcentration of wealth in the hands of the dominant\r\nPowers, thus putting an end to the economic advancement\r\nof certain developing countries that have charted for\r\nthemselves a balanced course of development and\r\nprogress. In the social field, attempts have been made to\r\nsteer the course of joint international action towards\r\nensuring the predominance of the values and principles of\r\na certain cultural tradition at the expense of the cultural\r\nconcepts and values of other nations. The dangers that\r\nthreaten the environment are still there. The question of\r\ndisarmament continues to be dealt with in consonance\r\nwith the priorities of the Powers that possess nuclear\r\nweapons and those that have passed the threshold of\r\nnuclear armament.\r\nWithin the United Nations, unipolarism has spawned\r\ntypes of behaviour characterized by selectivity, double\r\nstandards and putting the mechanisms of the international\r\nOrganization at the service of narrow self-interest. This\r\nhas led, among many other things, to a hasty application\r\nof the measures provided for in Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, such as sanctions and the use of armed force.\r\nSanctions have been applied on the basis of an extreme\r\ninterpretation, with the result that they have inflicted the\r\nmost grievous harm on the civilian populations in the\r\ntargeted countries and have deprived those people of their\r\nbasic human rights including, in particular, their right to\r\nnutrition, medication, education, work and development,\r\nas was the case with Iraq, where the comprehensive\r\nsanctions imposed for over five years now have resulted\r\nin the death of thousands of children, women and the\r\nelderly due to lack of food and medication.\r\nThese negative developments should not weaken our\r\nresolve. Now that we can diagnose the ailment, we have\r\nto be quick with the remedy. We should begin by\r\nactivating the democratic process in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. We should seek to reinforce the United\r\nNations mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and promote judicial remedies for such\r\nsettlements. We should reform the Security Council and\r\nits working methods in order to enable the Security\r\nCouncil to respond to the interests of the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States. We should lay down such\r\nrules and principles as would preclude the use of\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nmeasures set forth in Chapter VII for serving purposes that\r\nhave nothing to do with the objectives of the Charter.\r\nWe should also promote the role of the United Nations\r\nin the economic sphere with a view to creating balanced\r\ninternational economic relations based on the principles of\r\njustice, equity and interdependence in coping with the\r\nrequirements of development.\r\nFinally, we should act with full speed in all areas\r\nconcerning disarmament while seeing to it that the outcome\r\nof our endeavours will serve the interests of all rather than\r\nthe interests of some.\r\nThe President: I thank the Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Iraq for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Taha M. Marouf, Vice-President\r\nof the Republic of Iraq, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Abdourabou Mansour\r\nHadi, Vice-President of the Republic of Yemen\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Abdourabou Mansour Hadi,\r\nVice-President of the Republic of Yemen.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdourabou Mansour Hadi, Vice-\r\nPresident of Yemen, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Hadi (interpretation from Arabic): On behalf of\r\nthe delegation of Yemen, allow me to express our sincere\r\ncongratulations on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. I should add to those congratulations\r\nthe acknowledgment of the Government and people of\r\nYemen and my own personal appreciation for the efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nuntiring work in managing the Organization’s affairs and\r\nraising its standards in the service of all mankind.\r\nIt is also a source of great pleasure to me and pride\r\nthat I have been given the honour of participating in this\r\nspecial commemorative meeting. I should like to express to\r\nyou the support of the Republic of Yemen for the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts in the area of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security and to underscore the\r\nimportance we attach to the concepts contained in An\r\nAgenda for Peace and in the Agenda for Development.\r\nDespite the challenges and difficulties facing the\r\nOrganization as it discharges its functions and reaffirms its\r\ncharacter, the last five decades have yielded important\r\nhistoric achievements. These achievements have helped us\r\nto arrive at the present stage in forming a collective future\r\nvision.\r\nThe United Nations has contributed considerable\r\nefforts to our endeavours to achieve the purposes and\r\nuphold the principles which are the very foundations of\r\nthe Organization. It has scored outstanding successes on\r\na global scale in the field of peace-keeping, security and\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nIts greatest achievement is, perhaps, that it has\r\nspared mankind the horrors of a third world war. The\r\nOrganization has also contributed to the liberation of\r\nnations, the raising of mankind’s standard of living and\r\nthe affirmation of the human right to a free and dignified\r\nlife.\r\nYemen found in the noble purposes of the Charter\r\none of its worthy objectives and it became a Member on\r\n30 September 1947. At the time, the Yemeni people were\r\nlanguishing under the oppressive rule of the Imams and\r\nthe yoke of colonialism. The United Nations stood by our\r\npeople in their struggle to gain their independence and\r\nfreedom from the burden of colonialism in the southern\r\npart of the country. Similarly, the Yemeni people will\r\nnever forget the great efforts made on their behalf by the\r\nUnited Nations with a view to mitigating the suffering\r\nthey had to endure as a result of the separatist attempt,\r\nnor will we forget the humanitarian assistance given to\r\nthe affected areas in Yemen. The United Nations is still\r\ncontributing to the development process of our people in\r\ndifferent fields with the aim of achieving the desired\r\ndevelopment goals within the framework of democracy,\r\npluralism, freedom of the press and respect for human\r\nrights.\r\nYemen stresses the importance of reforming the\r\nUnited Nations which should extend to restructuring both\r\nthe main bodies and principal organs in such a way as to\r\nmeet the needs of Member States in line with recent\r\ninternational developments and to make certain that it will\r\nbe able to cope with the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nYemen therefore supports the drive towards renewal,\r\nrevitalization and the shedding of the negative attitudes of\r\nthe past and the stumbling blocks of the present in a\r\nsustained movement to refashion international relations\r\nand make them consistent with global trends which call\r\nfor democracy, development and respect for human rights.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nIt is time for us all to realize that concern with human\r\ndevelopment must represent a qualitative shift in the\r\ninterests of the international community. The North should\r\nno longer monopolize prosperity and the South must not be\r\nleft to face poverty alone. The gap between the varying\r\nstandards of living must be narrowed if collective security\r\nis not to remain diminished in scope and unstable in the\r\nshadow of the luxury of the few and the misery of the\r\nmajority. Since the dawn of civilization, the goal of\r\nhumanity has been world peace. While many steps have\r\nbeen taken towards the achievement of that goal, the road\r\nahead is still long. Social justice remains the optimum path\r\ntowards that goal.\r\nWe must also stand up to the recent tendency to\r\npursue racist policies and resort to force in pursuit of\r\nexpansionist gains under the slogan of “ethnic cleansing”,\r\na practice that gives free reign to a base natural disposition\r\nto kill and destroy at a level which defies reason and flouts\r\nevery moral precept.\r\nThere is no doubt that the international Organization\r\nneeds reform if it is to respond effectively to the demands\r\nof a new world economy and changing world order. The\r\nUnited Nations is quite capable of introducing the necessary\r\nreforms. All it needs is the political will of its Member\r\nStates.\r\nLet us make the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations a fresh start so that the Organization may play a\r\nmore effective role in the life of the international\r\ncommunity. This is an opportunity which must be seized\r\nand not wasted.\r\nThe President: I thank the Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Yemen for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdourabou Mansour Hadi, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. César Paredes Canto,\r\nVice-President of the Republic of Peru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. César Paredes Canto, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. César Paredes Canto, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Paredes Canto (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nPeru, a founder nation of our Organization joins in\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of\r\nthe United Nations with a message which, as is our\r\ntradition, strongly emphasizes our country’s unalterable\r\ndedication to peace.\r\nIn so doing, Peru reiterates its firm conviction that\r\na fundamental commitment to peace must continue to be\r\nthe focus of our common efforts in the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations because, without it, it would be\r\nimpossible to attain positive and permanent results in any\r\nof the world Organization’s other fields of activity.\r\nWe must therefore take an affirmative step on this\r\nsolemn occasion and today renew our pledge to the letter\r\nand spirit of the Charter, reaffirming that international law\r\nis the source of universal understanding and provides the\r\ncommon ground for guaranteeing civilized and peaceful\r\ncoexistence among the peoples and States of the world.\r\nThe United Nations has had unquestionable\r\nsuccesses in the 50 years of its existence. Peru recognizes\r\nthem and appreciates them at their full transcendent value.\r\nHowever, we cannot fail to stress that, during this period,\r\nwe have not experienced 50 years of world peace. The\r\nconflicts that are still proliferating in many parts of the\r\nEarth mean that, at this very moment, men, women and\r\nchildren are falling victim to armed clashes which, far\r\nfrom resolving problems, aggravate them because land\r\nthat is strewn with destruction and death is the most\r\nfertile ground for resentment and further sterile conflicts,\r\neven more bitter and prolonged, generating an endless\r\nspiral of violence.\r\nNevertheless, we are firmly convinced that the\r\nUnited Nations still represents the best choice for\r\ncollectively maintaining peace. That will require prompt\r\nreforms, so that the universal Organization may be able\r\nto strengthen its methods of work, review its priorities,\r\nand enhance its efficiency. With regard to the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, restructuring is\r\nindispensable and urgent if it is to maintain its usefulness\r\nand influence as a mechanism for preserving peace. The\r\nworld which gave rise to the present structure of the\r\nSecurity Council no longer exists. The world order\r\nemerging from the Second World War has been overtaken\r\nby events. Accordingly, the Council should, in order to be\r\neffective, adapt itself to the reality and challenges of the\r\npresent and the future, and should include representatives\r\nof the present world order. The rapid growth in the\r\nnumber of independent States and the emergence of new\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nPowers in the political and economic sphere should be\r\ntaken into account in the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil. Peru therefore advocates expansion of the Council\r\nin order to ensure equitable participation by developing\r\ncountries and it supports also the aspirations of States such\r\nas Japan and Germany to become permanent Members.\r\nThe capacity of the United Nations to respond to\r\nmultiple and changing challenges will continue to be put to\r\nthe test in the coming years and well into the twenty-first\r\ncentury. To face those new and varied challenges, we must\r\nstrengthen the world Organization and give it our renewed\r\nsupport. The new threats to peace and security are today\r\ntaking the form of deepening poverty, lack of food,\r\ndeficiencies in education, technological backwardness,\r\nviolence in the cities and environmental degradation. The\r\nUnited Nations has an active role to play to promote\r\ninternational cooperation and seek to remedy those\r\nproblems so that conditions can be created under which the\r\nglobal extension of progress may soon become a reality for\r\nall the peoples of the world.\r\nThe message of peace sent by our President, Mr.\r\nAlberto Fujimori, to all the Members of this Organization\r\nand in the same spirit, I am bringing on behalf of Peru, to\r\nthis solemn Commemorative Meeting carries the force and\r\nconviction of a people who, for over a decade, have lived\r\nand suffered through a wrenching history of internal\r\nviolence and who have regained the fundamental right to\r\nlive in harmony and look to the future with hope, to feel\r\nthat they are masters of their own fate. Peru, now filled\r\nwith optimism, is holding fast to the peace it has won and\r\nfervently hopes that the United Nations will make its action\r\never more effective so that the ideal of peace by which it\r\nwas founded may extend to all the peoples of the world.\r\nThe President: I thank the Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. César Paredes Canto, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Sidi\r\nMohamed, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Sidi\r\nMohamed, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nHis Royal Highness Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed,\r\nCrown Prince of the Kingdom of Morocco, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nCrown Prince Sidi Mohamed (interpretation from\r\nArabic): Allow me to deliver this address on behalf of\r\nHis Majesty. It reads as follows:\r\n“Fifty years ago, the United Nations was\r\ncreated on the initiative of fifty Nations with the\r\npurpose of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. Today, membership of the Organization has\r\nreached one hundred and eighty-five States. This\r\nclearly demonstrates the perspicacity of the original\r\nfounders.\r\n“Let us therefore congratulate our Organization\r\non its longevity and on the breadth of its purpose.\r\nLet us also congratulate ourselves on all that we\r\nhave secured from its ceaseless efforts to consolidate\r\nthe civilizational dimension of international\r\ncooperation.\r\n“Without a doubt, the United Nations has\r\ncontributed to the maturity humankind has achieved\r\nand to the enlightenment it has gained. This has led\r\nto the lowering of the barriers of antagonism and\r\ndivergence that prevailed in international relations in\r\nthe past, and to the laying of the framework for new\r\nmethods of international collaboration.\r\n“At the birth of our Organization in 1945, the\r\nexpectation was that its functioning was going to be\r\ncharacterized by sound international cooperation. It\r\nwas not long however before the world found itself\r\nin the grip of a cold war situation that developed\r\nbetween two blocs which competed for influence.\r\nThis situation led several countries of the South\r\nduring the nineteen sixties to align themselves with\r\none or the other of the two competing blocs, and to\r\nseek international cooperation outside the framework\r\nof the United Nations within which the international\r\ncommunity was supposed to work in understanding\r\nand harmony. As a result, the activity of the United\r\nNations was rendered ineffectual and its work in\r\nmany areas was marginalized. The specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations, be they in education,\r\nscience or culture, or in food, health or development,\r\nas well as the other agencies which were created by\r\nthe United Nations to benefit mankind through non-\r\npolitical activities, were marginalized and their role\r\ndiminished. The result was that humanity did not\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nbenefit from those agencies as it should have, whilst\r\ntheir specialized activities constitute the very essence,\r\nobjective and purpose of the United Nations — we\r\nmight even say, the very reason for its existence.\r\n“Today, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof our Organization, and as we stop to take stock of\r\nits strengths and weaknesses, we must reaffirm our\r\nfaith in its mission which must continue and in its\r\nprinciples which the Charter introduced as guidelines\r\nfor international action.\r\n“We are all aware that the Organization will not\r\nsucceed in carrying out its mission unless it is\r\nprovided with all the necessary means, especially the\r\nmaterial means that would enable it to do its work.\r\n“Therefore, if we are to remain deserving\r\nMembers of this Organization, we must carefully\r\nexamine its internal problems and, in consultation with\r\neach other, find the means to solve them.\r\n“If it is truly our desire to have mankind reap the\r\nbenefits of the activities of this Organization, and in\r\nparticular those of the specialized agencies in the areas\r\nof health and development and education and culture,\r\nwe must not waste any time in rescuing the\r\nOrganization and in making it capable of addressing\r\nthe issues that face mankind so that it may live up to\r\nthe hopes and expectations that have been attached to\r\nit. This must be done quickly, before there appears on\r\nthe international political scene another giant\r\nharbouring unipolar aspirations who would return us,\r\nGod forbid, to the era of the cold war from whose\r\nconsequences humanity suffered so much and from\r\nwhose influence it was deeply scarred.\r\n“On this special occasion, we would like to\r\nreaffirm before you our commitment to the principles\r\nof the United Nations, not only in our capacity as\r\nKing of Morocco, but also in our capacity as President\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which\r\nconsists of 54 member States and which speaks for\r\n1.2 billion people.\r\n“The rejection of violence and terrorism, the\r\ncommitment to peaceful coexistence, religious\r\ntolerance and enlightened thought are all deeply rooted\r\nin the precepts and teachings of Islam. This is what\r\ncompels us to commit ourselves, without compromise,\r\nto seeing that the principles of the Charter increasingly\r\ngovern international action, principles of peace and\r\nsecurity for all the components of human society.”\r\nThe President: I thank the Crown Prince of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco, who read out a message from the\r\nKing.\r\nHis Royal Highness Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed,\r\nCrown Prince of the Kingdom of Morocco, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir\r\nAnerood Jugnauth, P.C., K.C.M.G., Q.C., Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir\r\nAnerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Anerood\r\nJugnauth, P.C., K.C.M.G., Q.C., Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Mauritius, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth: I feel deeply privileged to\r\naddress this Assembly of sovereign nations on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nan Organization that has for the past half century been at\r\nthe service of mankind.\r\nOn this special day, we pay homage to the founding\r\nMembers who were motivated by the wish\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar”.\r\nTo those who have striven towards these goals, to all\r\nmen and women who have carried out the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and served its ideals, in particular those\r\nwho have given their lives during their service to the\r\nUnited Nations, let us today express our deepest and most\r\nsincere gratitude.\r\nAlthough at present the activities of the blue-\r\nhelmeted peace-keepers have emerged as the most visible\r\nrole associated with this world Organization, the United\r\nNations and its family of agencies are constructively\r\nengaged in a wide spectrum of challenging tasks.\r\nThe United Nations, through its agencies, has\r\ncontributed to the eradication of smallpox, immunized\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nfour fifths of the world’s children against deadly diseases,\r\nprovided food aid, coordinated emergency relief in the face\r\nof disasters, natural or otherwise, and helped to avert or end\r\nwars and maintain international peace and stability.\r\nSince adopting the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights in 1948, the United Nations has helped enact dozens\r\nof comprehensive agreements on political, civil, economic,\r\nsocial and cultural rights. The Earth Summit, the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development held\r\nin Rio de Janeiro in 1992, resulted in treaties on\r\nbiodiversity and climate change. With the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, women in developing\r\ncountries are better able to plan their families. The United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme has worked\r\nto reduce demand for illicit drugs and to suppress drug\r\ntrafficking. Let us also not forget the major role played by\r\nthe United Nations in bringing about the downfall of the\r\nabhorrent system of apartheid.\r\nOne of the greatest contributions of the United\r\nNations, in the view of my delegation, is the sense of\r\nconfidence and security it has created around the world by\r\nits very presence and existence. Rich or poor, big or small,\r\nliterate or illiterate, regardless of colour or creed, peoples\r\nand States may knock on the door of the United Nations in\r\nthe event of any attack, aggression or invasion. Although\r\nimmediate solutions may not always be readily available,\r\nnegotiations undertaken have generally proved to be\r\npositive. In the past 50 years the United Nations has been\r\nbusy creating a world run by law rather than by force. It is\r\nat the forefront of efforts to come to grips with conflicts\r\naround the world.\r\nMy country stands resolutely committed to the\r\nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations. We\r\nconsider it natural, therefore, that the United Nations should\r\nhave the support of all international organizations working\r\nfor peace worldwide, such as the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries or\r\nthe francophone community, among others.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nMy country has the honour of presiding over the\r\nConference of Heads of State and Government of the 47\r\ncountries that use French as a common language. At the\r\nFifth Summit, held in Mauritius in October 1993, we\r\ndecided to play a more political role on the international\r\nscene. We committed ourselves to seeking appropriate\r\nsolutions to major political and economic problems and to\r\nwork for peace, democracy and development within the\r\nframework of a new partnership with all the multilateral\r\norganizations, at the forefront of which is the United\r\nNations.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, which has gathered in one place the\r\nlargest-ever assembly of Heads of State and Government\r\nin modern history, provides us with the unique\r\nopportunity of thinking about how we can make the\r\nOrganization play a more effective and efficient role in\r\nthe future.\r\nThe United Nations is at the crossroads. It has\r\nalready been challenged by an unprecedented number of\r\nconflicts and humanitarian emergencies on an\r\nunprecedented scale throughout the world. It has, none the\r\nless, responded well, bearing in mind how severely under-\r\nresourced it has been. The time is not for despair but for\r\na renewal of efforts to rekindle the original aspirations of\r\nthe United Nations as an Organization committed to\r\nbuilding a functioning world community.\r\nFor years now we have agreed that it is essential to\r\nreview the functioning of the United Nations. My\r\ndelegation therefore fully supports the ongoing\r\ndiscussions by the different working groups set up to\r\nconsider ways and means of reforming and strengthening\r\nthe United Nations. A reinvigorated and effective United\r\nNations must be relevant to the aspirations of those it is\r\nmeant for. It is therefore important to ensure that,\r\nwhatever options we choose, they should respond to the\r\nindividual and collective needs of our peoples.\r\nIn this connection, the main organ of the United\r\nNations, the Security Council, should be made more\r\ndemocratic and representative through an expansion of its\r\nmembership at the level of both permanent and non-\r\npermanent members. The composition of the Security\r\nCouncil should reflect the aspirations of the United\r\nNations Charter as well as the present political,\r\ngeographical, economic and demographic realities.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation firmly believes that\r\nIndia, the largest parliamentary democracy, should be\r\nentitled to a permanent seat on the Security Council,\r\namong others, as well as a representative of the small\r\nisland States. Given the specificities of small island\r\nStates, I submit for the consideration of this august\r\ngathering that small island States as a group, reflecting a\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\ndistinctive reality, should find permanent representation on\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nNeed I stress the vulnerability of small island States,\r\nwhether from an environmental, economic or security point\r\nof view? I believe that what happened in Comoros recently\r\nis an ample reminder of such vulnerability. Therefore, the\r\nsmall island States, with their diversity and multiplicity of\r\npopulation, languages and cultures, deserve that their\r\nspecific vision of world affairs be heard at the main organ\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nFrom 51 in 1945 the membership of the United\r\nNations has increased to 185 today. This in itself is\r\nevidence of the expression of willingness on the part of the\r\ncountries of the world to come together, to unite and to\r\nwork together towards a common goal which would serve\r\nthe best interests of humanity.\r\nHowever, in this era of spectacular expansion of\r\naccess to global telecommunication technology and of a fast\r\nemerging interdependent world, it is important that we\r\nrealize and converge our efforts to bridge both the\r\neconomic gap and the technological gap between\r\nindustrialized and developing countries.\r\nIn this respect, many of the newly independent\r\ncountries of the post-war period which are Members of the\r\nUnited Nations require the concerted efforts and the special\r\nattention of the international community for the take-off of\r\ntheir economies.\r\nThe United Nations has a global mission to address\r\nfelt needs, to further the common objectives of the world\r\ncommunity and to promote the economic and social\r\nadvancement of peoples in all countries, big and small, thus\r\ncreating the conditions for the peaceful development of all.\r\nLet us therefore dedicate ourselves to creating such an\r\nenvironment in a spirit of mutual respect and harmonious\r\ncoexistence of the different cultures flourishing on the\r\nsurface of our planet. Let the culture of tolerance be fixed\r\nin people’s minds permanently and guide our actions\r\nthrough the next century.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Anerood\r\nJugnauth, P.C., K.C.M.G., Q.C., Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nLester B. Bird, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Right Honourable Lester\r\nBird, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Lester B.\r\nBird, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Antigua and Barbuda, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Bird: I come neither to bury the United Nations\r\nnor to praise it. Today the United Nations moral authority\r\nis sorely wounded, bleeding from its wounds in Bosnia,\r\nin Rwanda and in Somalia.\r\nRogue regimes in these places have challenged the\r\npower of the United Nations and found an impotent force\r\nconstrained by its limited operations’ mandate and\r\nweakened by the paucity of its resources. The might of\r\nthe world community, which should have been an\r\noverwhelming force to end conflict, stop killing and save\r\nlives, proved to be incapable of enforcing the peace that\r\nit set out to keep — hobbled essentially by its Member\r\nStates.\r\nBeyond its major task of prevention and termination\r\nof armed conflict, the United Nations also held out the\r\nprospect of economic progress for developing countries\r\nsuch as my own. Yet globally the poor have become\r\npoorer and the gap between the rich and poor nations has\r\nwidened to a chasm.\r\nSo far in the decade of the 1990s, the United\r\nNations has initiated five world conferences on\r\ndevelopment issues ranging from environment, through\r\nsocial issues and population, to the role of women. It\r\nremains to be seen whether the substance of these\r\nconferences will go any further than their form.\r\nBut if the contribution to these conferences by the\r\npowerful nations of the world is any measure of their\r\ncapacity\r\n“to employ international machinery for the\r\npromotion of the economic and social advancement\r\nof all peoples”,\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nas the Charter promised they would, then I suspect that the\r\nlabours of the 1990s will prove fruitless.\r\nIt is in this connection that I commend to Member\r\nStates urgent consideration of the proposal contained in the\r\nreport of the Commission on Global Governance for an\r\nEconomic Security Council, imbued with the same standing\r\nnow enjoyed by the Security Council on security matters,\r\nbut with a wider, more representative membership,\r\nincluding smaller States, to give political leadership and\r\npromote consensus on international economic issues. If this\r\nis not done the flame of hope which the United Nations\r\nignited in our hearts will lose even the flicker that is kept\r\nalive only by our commitment to internationalism.\r\nGrave environmental degradation has occurred at a\r\nrapid rate over the 50 years of the life of the United\r\nNations. The effects of global warming are already being\r\nfelt brutally in countries such as mine where the destructive\r\ncapacity of storms intensifies every year. If the depletion of\r\nthe ozone layer and the build-up of greenhouse gases in the\r\natmosphere continue unabated as a result of consumption\r\nand waste by just 20 per cent of the world’s people in rich\r\nnations, regions such as mine will be continuously\r\ndevastated by storms, with consequential refugee problems\r\nfor the States of the North.\r\nThe United Nations alerts the international community\r\nto the danger, but is powerless to act to prevent it.\r\nWhom do we blame for this troubling state of affairs?\r\nIt cannot be the United Nations, its Secretaries-General\r\nor the thousands of United Nations soldiers and civilians\r\nscattered around the world trying desperately to preserve\r\nthe prestige and authority of this body, which is supposed\r\nto represent the will and command of the world community.\r\nFrom the inception of the United Nations, its staff have\r\ntried to keep peace among warring forces; they have\r\ndelivered humanitarian aid, supervised elections and trained\r\npolice forces — all in the most trying circumstances.\r\nThe blame for the United Nations debilitation does not\r\nlie with them; it rests squarely on the shoulders of its\r\nMember States, and particularly on those States which\r\narrogate to themselves control of United Nations activities.\r\nWe must recall that when, 50 years ago, the founders\r\nof the United Nations brought this Organization into\r\nexistence, they did not create a world government, elected\r\nby and accountable to the people in whose name the\r\nCharter was proclaimed; what was constructed was an\r\ninternational corporation of States, with Member States as\r\nshareholders and the few permanent members in the\r\nSecurity Council as its Board of Directors.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations can only be as\r\neffective as its shareholders together want it to be and as\r\nits Board of Directors is mandated to direct it. The\r\nproblem has been that in large measure its shareholders\r\nhave not together made the Organization effective, and its\r\ndirectors have too often acted to advance their individual\r\ninterests rather than the Charter obligations which all\r\nMember States are pledged to uphold.\r\nIf the United Nations were a multinational company,\r\nit would have collapsed long ago. Starved of equity\r\nfinancing by its shareholders, unable to deliver the goods\r\nit claims to produce, stalemated at the level of its Board\r\nof Directors on decisions vital to its survival, it would\r\nhave been put into receivership or liquidation and a public\r\ninquiry would have been held into the conduct of its\r\noperations. Somebody or bodies would have had to\r\npay — or pay up.\r\nIn this connection, I might mention that my own\r\ncountry, small though it is and lacking in resources, has\r\npaid its contributions in full, including its peace-keeping\r\nassessments, and one quarter of my country’s defence\r\nforce is serving in Haiti in the United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping mission there.\r\nNo organization which has reached the age of 50 can\r\nbe without the need for reform. But we would make a sad\r\nmistake if we focused such reform on the Organization\r\nalone and neglected the role of States in reducing its\r\neffectiveness. The two must be done together, or we\r\nwould have treated only the symptoms of debilitation; we\r\nwould not have tackled its causes.\r\nThere is no shortage of recommendations for reform\r\nof the Organization: we have listened to them for two\r\ndays. In the short time allowed to me, I will not attempt\r\nto set out my own views on reforms. Suffice it for me to\r\nsay that the world of 1995 is vastly different from that of\r\n1945. Technological change, population growth,\r\nenvironmental vandalism, drug trafficking, rising poverty\r\nand the spread of disease have all conjoined globally to\r\nplace pressures upon States that not even the most\r\npowerful can withstand alone. The need for an organized\r\ninternational response to the problems confronting\r\nmankind has become greater, not smaller.\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nWith all its imperfections, the United Nations remains\r\nmankind’s best hope for solving together the problems that\r\njointly beset the world community.\r\nLet us reform the United Nations, by all means. Let us\r\ncut waste and improve efficiency, but, in doing so, let us\r\nensure that the decisions and operations of the Organization\r\neffectively express the desires of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, and not just the will of a privileged\r\nfew. Let us resolve to improve the capacity of the United\r\nNations by giving it the resources, functions and\r\ncoordinating powers that are essential to its tasks.\r\nIn the words of Brian Urquhart, a distinguished former\r\nservant of the United Nations, mankind has\r\n“created unprecedented possibilities for both progress\r\nand disaster on our planet without yet assuming the\r\ncollective responsibility that both these possibilities\r\ndemand”.\r\nAfter 50 years it is time for States to assume that\r\nresponsibility and, in doing so, to reconstruct a vision of\r\nnations united in the pursuit of a world of peace, equity and\r\njustice.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Lester B. Bird, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. David Oddsson, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Iceland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. David Oddsson, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Iceland.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. David Oddsson, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Iceland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Oddsson: The fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations is an occasion to reaffirm our commitment to this\r\nindispensable Organization and its ideals. The anniversary\r\nalso provides Member States with an opportunity to take\r\nstock of the Organization’s shortcomings and openly\r\ndiscuss how to overcome them.\r\nThe many important achievements of the United\r\nNations have sustained, and can enhance, the status of the\r\nOrganization. Furthermore, almost universal membership\r\nand combined resources provide the Organization with a\r\nunique potential for global action.\r\nSmaller States, including Iceland, equate multilateral\r\ncooperation with the maintenance of security in the widest\r\nsense. Ultimately, in the current international system, all\r\nthe countries of the world are increasingly affected by the\r\nsame difficulties and challenges, and they basically have\r\nthe same needs and aspirations. No single country,\r\nhowever powerful, can disregard global interdependence\r\nor turn a blind eye to problems of global significance.\r\nTo ensure that the United Nations lives up to its full\r\npotential, the process of adapting it to a changing global\r\nagenda must be brought to a successful conclusion.\r\nNecessary reforms need to be agreed upon and\r\nimplemented without delay. The composition of the\r\nSecurity Council should reflect new realities, through a\r\ngreater number of both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers. The General Assembly should become more\r\nfocused on relevance and efficiency.\r\nThe inherent link between peace and development is\r\nobvious. Sustainable development, already an established\r\nconcept, must become the basis of urgent action. The\r\nUnited Nations is the only available and conceivable\r\nvenue for concerted action on a global scale. It is the only\r\nOrganization capable of coordinating a reaction to the\r\ndisintegration of States and humanitarian disasters\r\nworldwide and for attaining consensus on environmental\r\nprotection and the management of natural resources.\r\nSimilarly, the United Nations is in a unique position,\r\nin cooperation with regional organizations, to initiate and\r\nconduct peace-keeping operations, monitor the\r\nimplementation of elections and agreements on human\r\nrights and carry out humanitarian interventions. This\r\ncapability must be enhanced, with a particular emphasis\r\non early warning and rapid deployment. At the same time,\r\nthe United Nations must not lose sight of maintaining\r\npeace for the long term by assisting in the reconstruction\r\nof societies ravaged by war.\r\nThere is a correlation between democracy and\r\nrespect for human rights, on the one hand, and\r\ninternational peace and stability, on the other.\r\nUnfortunately, many Member States of the United\r\nNations do not honour their commitments pertaining to\r\nhuman rights and democracy, which they voluntarily\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nundertook by signing the United Nations Charter and the\r\nUnited Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and this is\r\nrightly of concern to the international community. Human\r\nrights are universal, and their violation cannot be excused\r\nby reference to economic, social, religious or cultural\r\ncircumstances.\r\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, when mankind\r\nfaces many new and difficult challenges, it is deplorable\r\nthat the functioning and strengthening of the United Nations\r\nis being impeded by a financial crisis arising from the late\r\npayment or non-payment of assessed contributions to the\r\nOrganization. Member States should pay their contributions\r\nin full, on time and without conditions, as they are\r\nobligated to do under the Charter. The payment of arrears\r\nshould not be made dependent on reforms of the United\r\nNations. Moreover, reforms become impossible if the\r\nOrganization is financially crippled. There is general\r\nsupport among Member States for reforms; they are being\r\nconsidered and must be implemented.\r\nThe United Nations has achieved important results and\r\ncontinues to hold promise. This Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting in New York should reinvigorate the Organization\r\nand chart a course for the future. Let this be the legacy of\r\nthese three days in New York.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Iceland for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. David Oddsson, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Iceland, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ingvar Carlsson, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Sweden\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Ingvar Carlsson, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Sweden.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ingvar Carlsson, Prime Minister\r\nof the Kingdom of Sweden, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Carlsson: Reform is a popular word these days.\r\n“The United Nations has to be reformed” is a phrase that\r\nalmost every speaker at this rostrum has used during this\r\nMeeting. But it seems quite clear that the word reform has\r\ndifferent meanings for different speakers.\r\nThe Swedish Government is seeking reform in the\r\ngovernance and financing of the multilateral system —\r\nradical reform, in fact — but we will never allow reform\r\nto become a cover for cut-downs and cop-outs.\r\nEarlier this year, I wrote to 15 of my colleagues in\r\ndifferent parts of the world. I invited them to participate\r\nin an effort reflecting the concern of a number of political\r\nleaders who strongly believe in multilateralism, in global\r\nsolutions and in the United Nations.\r\nWe met yesterday to discuss the present situation of\r\nthe United Nations system and we adopted a statement in\r\nsupport of global cooperation to promote common\r\nsecurity and to improve the management of economic\r\ninterdependencies. This statement is an earnest, strong\r\ncommitment to work for a United Nations that can help\r\nus meet the new global challenges. The 16 of us have\r\nagreed to continue to keep in touch and to be prepared to\r\noffer our continued strong political support for a more\r\nvital United Nations, adapted also to the next century.\r\nThe necessary changes will not come about by\r\nthemselves. There is a need for a mechanism, a\r\nprocess — a process which will allow for a thorough\r\ndiscussion of all the constructive ideas and proposals that\r\nhave come up, within and outside of the United Nations.\r\nThe Commission on Global Governance, which I\r\nchair together with Sir Shridath Ramphal, has proposed a\r\nWorld Conference on Governance in 1998. Such a\r\nconference would offer an opportunity to discuss and\r\ndecide, in a comprehensive manner, a number of the most\r\nimportant issues: measures to safeguard the security of\r\npeople, steps to handle economic interdependencies, ways\r\nto strengthen the United Nations machinery and ways to\r\npromote respect for international law.\r\nNowhere is the crisis in multilateralism more\r\napparent than in the unwillingness of some Member\r\nStates to contribute. They want more and more from our\r\ncommon Organization, yet, these countries are not willing\r\nto pay their membership fees. That is simply not\r\nacceptable.\r\nWe live in a world where more and more services\r\nneed to be provided globally, in our truly common\r\ninterest. We must develop systems of financing that\r\nensure adequate, predictable and sustainable levels of\r\nfunding. The mandatory contributions should continue to\r\nbe the backbone of the financing of the core activities, but\r\nthe dependency of one large contributor must be reduced.\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nHowever, this may not be enough.I believe that the time\r\nhas come to seriously discuss alternative methods of getting\r\nthe necessary resources to the United Nations system. We\r\nneed to explore the possibility of creating an international\r\ntax on foreign currency transactions. We need to consider\r\nthe possibility of introducing charges for the use of\r\ncommon global resources such as the sea-lanes for ships or\r\nthe ocean fishing areas, or an extra tax on airline tickets.\r\nWhile these options are being explored, we must\r\nuphold the strictest respect for the financial commitments\r\nwe all have made when accepting the Charter of the United\r\nNations. It is a shame that so many Member States do not\r\npay when they owe this to the Organization. The United\r\nNations cannot be more than what its Members allow it to\r\nbe.\r\nAt a time when the work of the United Nations is\r\nmore important than ever, it is particularly urgent that all\r\nMembers pay their contributions in full and on time. I\r\nconfirm the commitment of the Government of Sweden to\r\ndo exactly that.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Sweden for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ingvar Carlsson, Prime Minister\r\nof the Kingdom of Sweden, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Habib Thiam, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Senegal\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Habib Thiam, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Senegal.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Habib Thiam, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Senegal, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Thiam (interpretation from French): Our\r\npresence at this “high place”, on behalf of His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdou Diouf, President of the Republic of Senegal, in\r\nan expression of the homage the people of Senegal to the\r\nfounding fathers of our Organization, and of their tribute to\r\nthe successive Secretaries-General, to you, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and to their staff who have served the\r\nUnited Nations, sometimes even sacrificing their lives.\r\nOur presence also bears witness to our renewed\r\nadherence to the ideals of the United Nations and it attests\r\nto our faith in, and commitment to, the Organization’s\r\nunique mission of peace and cooperation, solidarity and\r\nprogress. The world has changed and that is in keeping\r\nwith the interminable but ever renewed struggle for\r\nfreedom.\r\nThe world economy has deteriorated, going from one\r\ncrisis to another, to the detriment of developing countries.\r\nHuman rights have assumed a more important meaning,\r\na broader and more universal one.\r\nInternational peace and security, economic and social\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian aid and promotion of the rule\r\nof law continue to be permanent objectives which the\r\nUnited Nations has always been striving to achieve in the\r\nconstant struggle for freedom. Indeed, the United Nations\r\nhas not only persisted in this far-reaching enterprise, it\r\nhas also inspired a great number of major positive\r\ntransformations with a view to finding solutions to the\r\nproblems facing our human race.\r\nBut, even so, the appreciation of the Organization’s\r\nwork is often tainted with criticism which is sometimes\r\njustified but often unfounded. It is because the strength of\r\nthe United Nations is only a reflection of our own\r\nstrengths while its weaknesses or shortcomings are only\r\nour own. We should, therefore, make allowances. The\r\nUnited Nations exists and can only act in conformity with\r\nthe collective political will of our various States and with\r\nthe help of the means we put at its disposal.\r\nThe obstacles, or even the failures recorded so far —\r\nfor instance in the promotion of truly peaceful relations in\r\nconflict zones such as the Middle East, in the peace-\r\nkeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the\r\nhumanitarian aid to refugees and displaced persons from\r\nRwanda and Burundi, in the quest for general and total\r\ndisarmament, in improving people’s living standards, in\r\ncreating conditions for progress and development, in the\r\nfight against poverty and exclusion, in protection of the\r\nenvironment, in the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights, in the completion of the decolonization process,\r\nthe fight against illicit drug trafficking and terrorism, in\r\nthe progressive development of international law — these\r\nare mere reflections of the contradictory attitudes and\r\ninterests of our various States or even those of numerous\r\npressure groups.\r\nHence, it is important for our Governments to take\r\njoint action within the United Nations framework to fight\r\nagainst intolerance, hatred and oppression, wherever they\r\nexist. And since peace is indivisible, such an effort should\r\nbe geared towards transforming all the regions of the\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nworld and should cover all fields of human endeavour.\r\nSuch is the credo of President Abdou Diouf and the people\r\nof Senegal and that is why they have always responded\r\npositively to appeals for freedom, for instance, in the course\r\nof the Gulf War, in Liberia, Rwanda, in the former\r\nYugoslavia, in Cambodia, in Lebanon and in Shaba.\r\nMr. Ould Ely (Mauritania), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nHowever, peace implies also eliminating the acts of\r\ninjustice and the inertia that continue to characterize\r\ninternational economic relations. In this respect, the\r\nreplenishment of the funds for the World Bank’s\r\nInternational Development Association seems to us to be an\r\nurgent task for the rich nations. Such action goes hand in\r\nhand with the need to reduce appreciably, or even cancel,\r\nthe debts of developing countries, in addition to finding a\r\nsolution to the deteriorating terms of trade between the\r\nNorth and the South. This is still an aspect of the struggle\r\nfor freedom.\r\nNow that the ideological confrontations have ended,\r\nnew ideas are emerging to emphasize the need to go\r\nbeyond the traditional alliances and establish larger groups.\r\nIn Senegal, with President Abdou Diouf, we subscribe to\r\nthese ideas, which should be supported by everyone\r\nbecause we have a common destiny.\r\nThis new era of peace and freedom, implies the\r\ndefinitive disappearance of the long-outdated cleavages that\r\nhelped impede the international community’s progress\r\ntowards the fundamental goal of human solidarity. Above\r\nall, it calls for great generosity. Are generosity,\r\nwarmheartedness, development, peace and freedom\r\nincompatible? I do not think so.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nthank the Prime Minister of the Republic of Senegal for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Habib Thiam, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Senegal, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Maxime\r\nCarlot Korman, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Vanuatu\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Maxime Carlot Korman, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nVanuatu.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Maxime Carlot\r\nKorman, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Carlot Korman (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is both an honour and a privilege for me to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly and participate in this Special Meeting\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI should like, on behalf of the people of Vanuatu, to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfiftieth session.\r\nAs the Head of an Oceanian Government, I applaud\r\nthe admission of the Republic of Palau to the\r\nOrganization as its 185th Member.\r\nAt a time when we are celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and, in particular, the\r\ndevelopment programmes adopted and applied for the\r\nbenefit of Member States, and the means established to\r\nguarantee international peace and security, it is our duty\r\nto do more to help the Organization face the new\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Republic of Vanuatu congratulates the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and\r\nassures him of its support for the initiatives for reform\r\nrecently undertaken to meet the needs of Member States,\r\nparticularly in the fields of the sustainable development of\r\nisland States, protection of the environment, social\r\ndevelopment and the role of women. These initiatives\r\nmust now be taken up in other United Nations bodies.\r\nThe Security Council must be expanded to include\r\nother permanent members and to guarantee adequate\r\nrepresentation of the countries of the South, particularly\r\nsmall States. Similarly, the other major organs,\r\ninstitutions and specialized agencies of the United Nations\r\nmust be the subject of review in the light of the needs of\r\nthe international community of tomorrow.\r\nIn the same spirit of reform, the nations of the\r\nPacific feel that it is necessary today to review current\r\nregional bodies in the light of the development priorities\r\nthat they have set, taking account of developments in the\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\ninternational economic, social and political environment —\r\nin particular, within the United Nations system.\r\nThe Republic of Vanuatu, concerned about the social\r\nand economic future of the island communities of Oceania,\r\ntakes the opportunity of this Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting to appeal to the United Nations and all Member\r\nStates to focus more attention on the needs of our region.\r\nWhile many works and speeches recognize the Pacific as\r\nbeing the centre of the world in the twenty-first century, the\r\nnations and peoples that make it up have only a symbolic\r\nrate of economic growth, representing barely a fraction of\r\nthe rate of growth of most Asian countries.\r\nThe political situation in the Pacific may seem\r\ncomplex because some entities are Territories dependent on\r\ntheir respective Trusteeship authorities. However, the\r\npeoples of these island entities, whether or not they are\r\nindependent, face similar problems. They share the same\r\nPacific Ocean, which represents a quarter of the exclusive\r\neconomic zones of the planet’s oceans. Consequently, the\r\nconcept of sustainable development and the maintenance of\r\nlong-term regional peace and security for all the countries\r\nand territories of the Pacific region are today indispensable.\r\nLimiting United Nations consideration of needs and\r\npriorities to States Members of this Organization would be\r\ndefinite carelessness on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. We recognize that it is necessary to establish\r\na constructive dialogue with the Governments of the\r\nregional territories, and I call for their understanding.\r\nThe peoples and Governments of Oceania need more\r\nactive participation by the United Nations in the initiatives\r\nthey undertake in the context of appropriate sustainable\r\ndevelopment and regional peace and security. The plan for\r\na regional support unit adopted by the South Pacific Forum\r\nin Madang is an example worth considering.\r\nOur Asian Pacific region is passing through a delicate\r\nperiod. The threat to the environment and to peoples posed\r\nby nuclear testing, plans for the storage of nuclear and\r\nchemical wastes, the transporting of the nuclear wastes of\r\nvarious countries, and the spread of radioactivity as a result\r\nof testing with no thought for environmental safety are\r\ntoday a question of international importance. This lack of\r\nrespect for the Pacific can and might be the beginning of a\r\ndisaster, not only for us in Oceania but also for\r\ninternational security and the environment of coastal States.\r\nThe Republic of Vanuatu congratulates France, not\r\nonly for limiting testing but also for taking measures to\r\nprotect the environment and for its commitment to the\r\ndenuclearization of the Pacific and the world.\r\nFurthermore, the Republic of Vanuatu welcomes the\r\nrecent announcement by France, the United Kingdom and\r\nthe United States of America of their joint decision to\r\nsign the Protocols to the Treaty making the South Pacific\r\na nuclear-free zone.\r\nOnce again, by focusing special attention on the\r\nneeds and problems of these island nations the United\r\nNations will be contributing to the region’s efforts to\r\nrestructure existing bodies, enabling them to respond\r\nbetter to the expectations of the island populations.\r\nLet us respect peoples and guarantee life in the\r\nregions of our world. Let us effectively protect the\r\nenvironment in our respective regions. In a word, let us,\r\ntogether, build a more pacific world.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Vanuatu for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Maxime Carlot\r\nKorman, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Vanuatu, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Marc Forné Molné,\r\nPrime Minister of the Principality of Andorra\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime\r\nMinister of the Principality of Andorra, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nMr. Forné Molné (spoke in Catalan; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): On this special day and in\r\nthis illustrious forum, it is my task as Head of\r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra to convey to\r\nthe General Assembly the hopes of the people of Andorra\r\nfor an ever stronger and ever more effective United\r\nNations and, at the dawn of the third millennium, our\r\nyearning for a more just and prosperous world that can\r\nsatisfy the noble aspiration of our great human family to\r\npeace and development.\r\nIn the face of the ever-present examples of lack of\r\ntolerance and solidarity, it might seem that to speak of the\r\n“human family” is to speak of a desire rather than of a\r\n42\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nreality. Making the facts accord with the words spoken in\r\nthis forum depends to a very large extent on us.\r\nToday, with five years to go before the year 2000,\r\ncommunications and information have become global, and\r\neconomic and political relations between peoples transcend\r\nfrontiers in a way that was unforeseeable at the beginning\r\nof this century, now drawing to a close. The women and\r\nmen everywhere can feel that they are citizens of the world,\r\nover and above their links to their village, city, nation or\r\nState.\r\nAt the beginning of this century, we began to\r\nunderstand that the world was getting smaller, particularly\r\nfollowing the World Wars, a bad example which did\r\nhowever serve to stimulate the nobler initiatives of\r\nmankind. The creation of the United Nations, based on the\r\nuniversal values of tolerance and peace, overturned the old\r\nworld-view, and from global war we moved on to collective\r\nsolidarity and the challenges of development.\r\nSince then, not everything has been well done. The\r\nworld continues to be imperfect and to be plagued by\r\nconflict and misery. Even as we speak in this temple of\r\npeaceful coexistence, fighting is under way in many places;\r\nchildren are continuing to die; yet more widows are\r\nweeping over their husbands; yet more parents are losing\r\ntheir children.\r\nIt is not easy to continue to speak of good intentions\r\nbut we must do it. We must insist on the values that can\r\nallow mankind to survive: respect for human rights, the\r\nfundamental importance of the individual, the conservation\r\nof our natural and historical heritages.\r\nWe shall have to use preventive diplomacy more often\r\nand we shall also have to reform certain aspects of the\r\nstructure of the United Nations, including the Security\r\nCouncil, the Economic and Social Council, and the\r\nOrganization’s financial capacity and administrative\r\nstructure.\r\nYet we must not tamper with the founding principles\r\nof this Organization. We must zealously preserve the\r\nprinciple of equality between States; it is the source of\r\ntolerance between great and small, the key to a balanced\r\ndialogue between the great and the small communities.\r\nUndoubtedly, the great States can take correct decisions that\r\nwill affect us all. But they can also make overwhelming\r\nerrors in direct proportion to their very size and with\r\nmultiple side-effects.\r\nSmall States such as Andorra must continue to be\r\nthe ones to steer the great towards dialogue and see to it\r\nthat unambiguous words and open hands, which are the\r\ntools of peace, are used more often, and that the tools of\r\nwar are laid aside.\r\nBecause of the demands of our histories, small\r\ncommunities can give us lessons in peaceful coexistence,\r\ncordial understanding, respect and tolerance. The cultural\r\ndiversity of human communities obligates us, in a global\r\nworld, to a dialogue among equals; this is the heart,\r\nmotor and soul of the respect for others which is an\r\nessential value for peace and development.\r\nMy small country, the State of Andorra, is the\r\nhistorical result of an arbitration that took place in the\r\nthirteenth century and has allowed Andorrans to keep and\r\nconfirm their identity at all times throughout the most\r\nturbulent centuries of old Europe. The Catalan writer\r\nSalvador Espriu called Andorra “this prodigy, almost a\r\nmiracle”. Bound by the heritage of our ancestors, I can\r\nguarantee that Andorra, as hitherto, will spare no effort to\r\nshare with other States its history of 700 years of peace\r\nand tolerance as well as all we have learned from being\r\na land of refuge. Our experience is similar to that of\r\nmany other small States and one which the big States\r\nshould understand and value.\r\nWe celebrate joyfully the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations and wish it well on its first half-century\r\nof existence. Today, we all pledge to help it advance, as\r\na standard of equality among men and women and\r\npeoples, an advocate of tolerance, an instrument for\r\npromoting peace, for defending our natural heritage and\r\nfor development. Many happy returns, United Nations!\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI thank the Prime Minister of the Principality of Andorra\r\nfor his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime\r\nMinister of the Principality of Andorra, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Goh Chok Tong,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Singapore\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Goh Chok Tong, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Singapore.\r\n43\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Goh Chok Tong, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Singapore, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Goh: We congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral on his election to preside over this historic fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I would also like to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\nleadership of and dedication to the Organization. Let me\r\nassure both of them of my delegation’s full support.\r\nThe United Nations has been criticized, even\r\nmaligned. Some of the criticisms are valid, but many of\r\nthem are unfair. Let us not forget that the United Nations\r\nhas contributed to a better world, despite its shortcomings\r\nand failures in several areas.\r\nGlobalization will be the major driving force in the\r\nnext 50 years. Advances in telecommunications and\r\ntechnology, new ideas, global concerns over the\r\nenvironment and security, multinational joint ventures in\r\nbusiness and the economic reforms and outward orientation\r\nof more and more countries will push nations to work\r\ntogether rather than against each other.\r\nRegional groupings and multilateral bodies are\r\nbecoming increasingly important. New institutions and\r\nforums, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,\r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, the\r\nRegional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations and the proposed Asia-Europe meeting, are being\r\ncreated. Existing institutions, such as the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization, and such new ones as the World Trade\r\nOrganization are also adapting to the changing environment.\r\nThe United Nations may not necessarily be the prime\r\nmover in many world events, given the increasing strength\r\nof these regional and multilateral bodies. But it has a very\r\nimportant integrative function: that of maintaining global\r\ncoherence and ensuring that no country is excluded in the\r\nmarch towards security, peace and prosperity.\r\nGlobalization will change the way we look at\r\nsovereign authority. Those cities and areas within larger\r\nnation-States that can go global and link up with others\r\noutside their national boundaries will flourish as an integral\r\npart of a larger region. Those that stay local will lag\r\nbehind. It is here that the United Nations can make a big\r\ncontribution by helping sovereign States to integrate as\r\nparts of a larger economic entity and world community.\r\nTo meet these challenges, the United Nations must\r\nstreamline and rationalize itself. Financial reform is a\r\ncritical area. The United Nations cannot flounder from\r\nfinancial crisis to financial crisis. But no financial reform,\r\nhowever worthy and efficient, will be politically\r\nacceptable if the fundamental principle that Member\r\nStates must pay their assessed contributions in full, on\r\ntime and without conditions is compromised. Assessed\r\ncontributions are binding legal obligations. They are not\r\nto be lightly discarded when inconvenient. To flout them\r\nunilaterally goes against the very grain of the United\r\nNations ideal.\r\nSecurity Council reform is another key area. There\r\nis as yet no consensus on which or how many or what\r\nkind of new members there should be, or on what terms.\r\nWe believe that the most practical means of achieving\r\nconsensus on the reform of the Security Council is to\r\nidentify objective general criteria that all permanent\r\nmembers, present or aspiring, must fulfil. This rational\r\napproach of setting a common standard of responsibilities\r\nas well as privileges will better stand the test of time. If\r\nwe can agree on this, consensus on specific countries will\r\nnaturally emerge.\r\nSingapore will continue to be deeply committed to\r\nthe United Nations. The United Nations is not perfect, but\r\nit is the best institution akin to a world government that\r\nwe have. Small countries like Singapore need the United\r\nNations, and must play a constructive role in supporting\r\nit. We take the United Nations seriously, and will actively\r\nhelp build consensus and facilitate agreement.\r\nThe United Nations alone cannot make a better\r\nworld. It must be backed by the political will and the\r\nconstructive contribution of its Members. The United\r\nNations will become stronger and more relevant if\r\nMember States support it with clear, realistic and practical\r\nlong-term goals. There is no greater hope for a better\r\nworld than an effective United Nations whose Members\r\nare committed to bringing this about.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI thank His Excellency Mr. Goh Chok Tong, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Singapore, for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Goh Chok Tong, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Singapore, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of India\r\n44\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His Excellency\r\nMr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof India.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of India, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Rao: Half a century ago today, world leaders\r\ngathered together to create an institution of the peoples of\r\nthe world to save succeeding generations from the scourge\r\nof war. That was a momentous event in human history.\r\nToday, in commemorating that event, we look back and\r\nfind that the successes of the United Nations have been\r\nmany. Critics tend to concentrate upon failures, but on an\r\nobjective appraisal the United Nations remains humankind’s\r\nbeacon of hope. The combined United Nations family has\r\nmade commendable efforts for the overall well-being of\r\nmankind.\r\nIf the relevance of the United Nations is to continue,\r\nwe will now need to address the root causes of what afflicts\r\nhumankind. Looking into the causes even casually, nuclear\r\nweapons still loom large, nowhere near abolition. Poverty\r\nand underdevelopment are pervasive in many continents.\r\nInternational terrorism haunts the innocent. Harmony in\r\npluralistic societies, whose number is the largest, is being\r\ndisrupted by increasing fundamentalist trends based on\r\nexclusivism and intolerance, and in many cases hatred.\r\nFor several decades the spell of the cold war gripped\r\nthe global community almost completely. The cold war\r\nbrought a dual approach to every department of human\r\nlife — politics, economics, war, peace, societal questions,\r\nart, literature: everything. The public and the private, the\r\nindividual and the collective, the orthodox and the liberal,\r\nthe status quo and the pro-change — all these dualities have\r\nto be resolved, not in theory, but in reality, to bring\r\nhappiness to man and also to suit individual conditions.\r\nWhile no system can work without a philosophical\r\nunderpinning, the present juncture provides new\r\nopportunities to address problems without the morbid\r\npreoccupations of the earlier confrontation.\r\nThe task of statesmanship has always been to sift the\r\npermanent from the ephemeral. An emphasis on\r\ncommonality is therefore of the essence in the world of\r\ntomorrow which, paradoxically, tends to shrink in terms of\r\nphysical distance, but threatens at any moment to fall apart\r\nin many other respects.\r\nThere can be no security for anyone in a world\r\nbristling with nuclear weapons. Deterrence is a false\r\nbelief. I would make a fervent appeal to this Assembly to\r\ntake credible steps for the complete elimination of all\r\nnuclear weapons within a stipulated time-frame. India’s\r\nAction Plan, presented in 1988 in this regard, could serve\r\nas an appropriate starting-point. India looks upon it\r\nessentially as a proposal inspired by Gandhian principles\r\nand is fully committed to it.\r\nThe world’s great danger today is the spread of\r\nterrorism. When sponsored and supported by States,\r\nterrorism becomes another means of waging war. The\r\ninternational community must therefore resolve to combat\r\nthis menace, since it threatens the very basis of peaceful\r\nsocieties.\r\nThe realities today are trans-ideological. The crying\r\nneed of a vast majority of nations is all-round\r\ndevelopment. This has to be Priority One for a long time.\r\nWe need a vision of global harmony and cooperation,\r\ntranscending many atavistic tendencies. Here, the message\r\nof Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of peace and non-\r\nviolence, could lead the world to a safe haven in the\r\ncoming millennium.\r\nThe United Nations today includes a much larger\r\nnumber of independent, sovereign States than when it\r\nbegan. In such a context, the United Nations cannot\r\nafford to be seen as either exclusivist or incomplete,\r\neither in appearance or in outlook. In particular, an\r\nadequate presence of developing countries is needed on\r\nthe Security Council on the basis of objective criteria:\r\nnations of the world must feel that their stakes in global\r\npeace and prosperity are factored into United Nations\r\ndecision-making.\r\nAt the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we\r\nthus have the task of making the United Nations truly and\r\neffectively the global repository of humankind’s\r\naspirations. Right-thinking nations and peoples working\r\ntogether have in the past achieved miracles. I am\r\nconfident that they can do so again. India will be proud\r\nand happy to be part of such an endeavour.\r\nI have deliberately kept bilateral matters out of this\r\nshort intervention.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI thank His Excellency Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of India, for his statement.\r\n45\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nHis Excellency Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of India, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Denmark\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His Excellency\r\nMr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Denmark.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Denmark, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Rasmussen: The creation of the United Nations\r\ngave birth to hope. Although the dreams of the founding\r\nfathers have not been fully realized, we remain committed\r\nto a strong partnership striving for freedom, peace and\r\ndevelopment. No lasting answers are found in isolationism\r\nor nationalism. We share fears and hopes. We have a\r\ncommon agenda and common responsibility.\r\nWe dedicate this anniversary to the thousands of\r\npeople who have put their lives at risk for the ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe new opportunities provided by the end of the cold\r\nwar must be used to implement a soft security policy. We\r\nneed to decide on a serious and active follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. This will be a\r\ndecisive part of the United Nations agenda in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. We need a new strategy. Peace and security\r\nare more than military concepts. Soft security policy\r\nmeasures, such as poverty alleviation, sustainable economic\r\nand social development, protection of the environment and\r\npromotion of human and equal rights, are as important as\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nExperience has taught us that prevention is better than\r\ncure. In times of crisis, speed is of the essence. The ability\r\nto act quickly is often what separates failure from success.\r\nThe United Nations needs a swifter, more credible response\r\nto crisis.\r\nThat is why my country, Denmark, has proposed that\r\nthe existing United Nations stand-by forces arrangement be\r\naugmented by a multilateral brigade at a state of high\r\nreadiness. This would greatly improve the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to act. If an effective stand-by arrangement\r\nhad been in place, we might have been spared many, many\r\nof the conflicts we are now facing. Sparks are easier to\r\nput out than fires. Denmark plans to earmark our\r\ncontribution to the current stand-by forces for such an\r\narrangement. We urge other nations to do likewise.\r\nWe, the political leaders, are responsible for pointing\r\nthe way for the United Nations. We set the agenda. We\r\ndecide the priorities. The problems of the United Nations\r\nare our problems and our responsibility. Yes, reform and\r\nrationalization are needed. So is the will to provide the\r\nOrganization with political support and financial\r\nresources.\r\nThe United Nations is exactly as strong as we make\r\nit. If the Organization does not fulfil our expectations, our\r\ncredibility — I repeat, our credibility — is at stake.\r\nInstead of criticizing the United Nations for not doing\r\nenough, we should take a close look at ourselves to see\r\nif we are doing enough for the United Nations.\r\nLet us be frank: the current financial crisis threatens\r\nto undermine what has been built up over the past 50\r\nyears. It is an illusion that an Organization deprived of\r\nfinancial resources should be more susceptible to reform.\r\nSecuring peace and development costs money. But the\r\nexpense of doing nothing will be far greater. It is highly\r\nregrettable that development assistance from the richest\r\npart of the world, the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) countries, has\r\ndropped to its lowest level in 20 years. The United\r\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national\r\nproduct must be met as soon as possible.\r\nThe United Nations is larger than it was 50 years\r\nago, but the world is smaller. The challenges of the next\r\ncentury are before us. We are dependent on each other.\r\nWe have a shared responsibility. The world needs the\r\nUnited Nations more than ever.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI thank His Excellency Mr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Denmark, for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Denmark, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Samdech Krom Preah\r\nNorodom Ranariddh, First Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Cambodia\r\n46\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His Royal\r\nHighness Samdech Krom Preah Norodom Ranariddh, First\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia.\r\nHis Royal Highness Samdech Krom Preah Norodom\r\nRanariddh, First Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nHis Royal Highness Norodom Ranariddh\r\n(interpretation from French): The Royal delegation of\r\nCambodia, which I have the honour to head, is doubly\r\npleased to participate in this fiftieth anniversary of the\r\ncreation of the prestigious United Nations.\r\nFirst, this fiftieth anniversary is an opportunity for us\r\nto reaffirm our support for the ideals of the United Nations\r\nand its constant efforts to ensure peace and development.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia will support all efforts to\r\ndemocratize our Organization. It would also like to see the\r\nadmission to the Security Council of new permanent\r\nmembers, such as Germany, Japan and some large States of\r\nthe South.\r\nSecondly, this year marks also the fortieth anniversary\r\nof the admission of Cambodia as a Member of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe conflict in Cambodia has ended. The suffering\r\nand upheavals of our people lasted for many years. The\r\nvictory of our people, over itself and over external forces,\r\nand the success of the United Nations are the result of a\r\nvery close collaboration. The positive outcome of the peace\r\nprocess in Cambodia can be seen as an example of a\r\nsuccessful United Nations peace-keeping operation.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is pleased today to be able\r\nto contribute to reducing tensions and even conflicts in the\r\nregion of Asia and the Pacific. In becoming reintegrated\r\ninto the international community, the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia is determined to promote peace, stability and\r\nprosperity within that region and in the world.\r\nIn that respect, my delegation fully supports the plan\r\nof action, presented by President Bill Clinton from this\r\nrostrum, to combat terrorism, drug cartels and organized\r\ncrime, and to reduce the numbers of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nIt is true that Cambodia and the Cambodian people\r\nhave had the historical good fortune of the presence of His\r\nMajesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varman. The sole\r\nconcern of our illustrious sovereign even to save his\r\npeople and his country. Inflexible on essential matters,\r\nHis Majesty the King guided his people along the\r\ndreadful path from martyrdom to peace. In this spirit, it\r\nis my great honour and privilege to read out the following\r\nmessage that His Majesty the King has addressed to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“Your Excellency, on the auspicious occasion\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations, I should like, on behalf of the\r\npeople of Cambodia, to extend to Your Excellency\r\nand the staff of the United Nations Organization our\r\nwarmest congratulations.\r\n“Fifty years ago, the end of the Second World\r\nWar led to the founding of the United Nations in\r\nSan Francisco. Since its inception, our Organization\r\nhas played an important role in helping to solve\r\nconflicts caused by the period known as the cold\r\nwar, when the then-super-Powers were constantly\r\nchallenging each other, bringing the world to the\r\nbrink of war. The United Nations also played a\r\ncritical role, often under very difficult circumstances,\r\nin defusing regional conflicts around the world.\r\n“The contribution of the United Nations to\r\nworld peace has been unique. Through its specialist\r\nbodies such as UNICEF, the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nand others, the United Nations has provided both\r\nemergency assistance to people around the world in\r\nurgent need and development assistance to help raise\r\nthe standard of living of millions of people. We\r\nsalute the staff of these United Nations\r\nOrganizations and thank them for their noble\r\nendeavours.\r\n“We Cambodians are particularly indebted to\r\nthe United Nations for helping our country and\r\npeople to regain their freedom and independence.\r\nWe recall with profound gratitude the noble efforts\r\nof His Excellency Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Your\r\nExcellency’s immediate predecessor, and of Their\r\nExcellencies Raffeuddin Ahmed and Yasushi\r\nAkashi, two of Your Excellency’s close\r\n47\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\ncollaborators. Cambodians will never forget the\r\nassistance provided to our country by the United\r\nNations.\r\n“I very much regret that poor health prevents me\r\nfrom joining Your Excellency and other Heads of\r\nState at the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, but I shall be with you all in\r\nspirit.”\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nthank His Royal Highness Samdech Krom Preah Norodom\r\nRanariddh, First Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia, for his statement.\r\nHis Royal Highness Samdech Krom Preah Norodom\r\nRanariddh, First Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Major-\r\nGeneral Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Fiji\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Honourable Major-\r\nGeneral Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Fiji.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Major-General\r\nSitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Fiji, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMajor-General Rabuka: My country joins other\r\nMember States in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. We salute its achievements and\r\nacknowledge its vital role in the promotion of international\r\npeace, security and cooperation.\r\nAs a forum for dialogue and reconciliation, it has\r\ncontributed immensely towards the avoidance of a global\r\nwar for the longest time in modern history. While it may\r\nnot have fulfilled all the promises that the Charter holds, its\r\nutility and institutional durability are firmly established.\r\nWe pay tribute to the founding fathers for their vision\r\nand for the ideals that they set for us. In Fiji we share the\r\nnorms and values reflected in the Charter. Hence, 25 years\r\nago, on attaining independence, one of the first acts of my\r\ncountry was to become a Member of this Organization.\r\nThen, my country pledged its support for the Charter and\r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in it. I reaffirm that\r\npledge.\r\nOver the years, the United Nations has shown\r\nresilience in accepting new Members, in appreciating\r\nchanges within States and in resolving unexpected\r\ncomplexities in relations between States.\r\nToday, as we celebrate its successes, we do so\r\nexpecting that new realities will be grasped with\r\nappropriate positive responses. For instance, we are\r\nwitnessing the economic resurgence of Asia and the\r\nrapidly diversifying international role of Asian nations.\r\nThis must be reflected accordingly in the decision-making\r\nstructures of the United Nations. My country considers\r\nimportant the unification of Korea and the rectification of\r\nanomalies in the relationship between the People’s\r\nRepublic of China and Taiwan.\r\nI commend the United Nations for its concern for\r\nsmall States. In the South Pacific, we have many small\r\nStates, limited in resources, with constraints on our\r\nearning capacity. We are linked to the international\r\ncommunity. Its stresses and downturns especially affect\r\nus. We remain anxious over the consequences of global\r\nwarming. Our fragile South Pacific environment needs\r\nprotection from all destructive acts, whether they be from\r\nnuclear tests and weapons or excessive economic\r\nexploitation. In this regard, we are happy to note the\r\nundertaking given by President Chirac yesterday from this\r\nrostrum that France will sign the Protocols to the Treaty\r\nof Rarotonga next year. But this undertaking, sadly, is not\r\nenough. We and the peoples of the Pacific pray that\r\nFrance will cease its nuclear testing in the region\r\nimmediately. We also remain committed to gender\r\nequality, in harmony with local values and traditions. As\r\nwe look ahead, I wish to remind fellow Members of the\r\nnecessity to implement programmes for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small States. The United Nations must\r\nalso find ways of utilizing the skills and talent of the\r\nincreasing number of qualified and experienced nationals\r\nof these States.\r\nOn this auspicious occasion, I welcome the\r\nconclusion of the draft declaration by the United Nations\r\nWorking Group on the rights of indigenous peoples. The\r\naction was most appropriate, even if belated. We look\r\nforward to its early adoption. Not all the wrongs that\r\nhistory has wrought upon indigenous peoples can now be\r\nput right. There are, none the less, significant where\r\nredress is possible; the United Nations should not hesitate\r\nto ensure for these that remedy is expeditious.\r\nThe norms of the powerful have in the past been\r\nimposed to disinherit indigenous people, and to this day\r\n48\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nin some places, to deny them the political self-\r\ndetermination essential for their social and economic\r\nadvancement. The United Nations must guarantee that\r\nexternal values and forces do not continue to coerce\r\npolitical concessions, economic reforms and social changes\r\nnot desired by indigenous peoples themselves.\r\nWe have contributed to the best of our capacity to the\r\nmultifaceted activities of the United Nations, including\r\npeace-keeping in troubled areas and to the development of\r\nthe Law of the Sea. We shall continue to contribute to its\r\nefforts for peace and security as a participating Member in\r\nthe community of nations. We remain confident that this\r\nOrganization will remain true to its ideals; hence I reaffirm\r\nmy own and my country’s commitment to it.\r\nI wish the United Nations Organization well as it sails\r\ninto its next half century.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nthank the Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Major-General\r\nSitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Fiji, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir\r\nJames Fitz-Allen Mitchell, P.C., M.P., Prime Minister of\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by His Excellency\r\nThe Right Honourable Sir James Fitz-Allen Mitchell, P.C.,\r\nM.P., Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sir James Fitz-\r\nAllen Mitchell, P.C., M.P., Prime Minister of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nSir James Fitz-Allen Mitchell: In the beginning was\r\nthe Word and the Word was made flesh.\r\nIn the passage of history, ideas are translated or\r\ntransformed into substance. Over the passage of time, men\r\nwith vision conceive an idea, create an institution, and one\r\nthat benefits mankind for all time. Our United Nations\r\nbelongs to this noble category, of which there are few that\r\nhave earned 50 years’ respect.\r\nBut this does not mean that the structure of the\r\nUnited Nations is perfect. Living institutions, like\r\nanything biological, need the nurture of fresh nutrients,\r\nfresh ideas. A living thing either improves or perishes. If\r\nit does not adjust to the supreme law of the universe, that\r\nis, the universality of useful change, then the definition of\r\nanachronism awaits this once inspired body.\r\nThe victors of the Second World War wrote the\r\nrules and enshrined their importance with permanent seats\r\non the Security Council. The defeated peoples of Japan\r\nand Germany, who in one lifetime transformed their\r\ncountries into economic world leaders, have earned the\r\nright to belong to this charmed inner circle. By the same\r\ntoken, other evolving regions which have demonstrated\r\ntheir economic potential should among themselves have\r\nthe right to a permanent seat on the Security Council.\r\nLest it be thought that the United Nations is to\r\nbecome only a place for the wealthy, so too should other\r\nregions be recognized, such as Africa, Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean. Room should however remain for\r\ncountries to secure a place on an individual basis.\r\nThe celebration of this anniversary would not have\r\nbeen so worthy a cause if the evils of communism had\r\nnot been put to rest. We still await atonement by those\r\nwho imposed such monumental waste on our civilization.\r\nI personally would wish to single out Mr. Gorbachev for\r\nhis leadership in having jettisoned this awful load on our\r\nbehalf, and creating the opportunities to carry us\r\nsumptuously into the twenty-first century.\r\nThe United Nations has much unfinished business.\r\nI wish to single out one item on that unfinished agenda,\r\nand that is the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem. I\r\nbegan with the evolution of the word and ideas. Ideas\r\nsometimes take rigid form, and no greater rigidity exists\r\nthan in religion.\r\nJerusalem being the birthplace of Christianity,\r\nJudaism and the Muslim faiths, all three have equal claim\r\nto sovereignty over this cradle of their religion. Jerusalem\r\nshould become an international city under the umbrella of\r\nthe United Nations, protected with that status by those\r\nwho have the power and the moral authority to do so. I\r\nsee this as a way to peace among the believers. I see this\r\nas an idea to erode the terrorism that haunts much of our\r\neveryday life around the world. It is not fair that so much\r\nenergy, time and financial resources be dedicated to\r\ncoming to terms with this terrorist evil that ought to have\r\nno basis for its existence.\r\n49\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nFinally, I would urge that this United Nations be no\r\nclosed shop. Millions of people are still unrepresented\r\namong us. The world body must find a way to embrace the\r\nworld.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sir James Fitz-\r\nAllen Mitchell, P.C., M.P., Prime Minister of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Mr. Denzil\r\nDouglas, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency The Honourable Mr. Denzil\r\nDouglas, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Douglas: I am deeply honoured to represent the\r\npeople of Saint Kitts and Nevis on this historic fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations has special significance for the\r\nGovernment and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Prior to\r\nmy country’s attainment of political independence in 1983,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis was fortunate to have benefited from\r\nUnited Nations agencies such as the World Health\r\nOrganization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the\r\nInternational Labour Organisation, all of which have helped\r\nto prepare my people for the attainment of political\r\nindependence.\r\nThis golden anniversary of the United Nations marks\r\na watershed in the history of our Organization. The\r\nconfiguration of world affairs has changed significantly\r\nsince the historical signing of the Charter in San Francisco\r\nsome 50 years ago. However, many old problems still\r\nfeature prominently on the international agenda. This\r\nwatershed year, therefore, is a call for nations to marshal\r\ntheir energies and to pool their resources, to harness a\r\nfuture worthy of being passed on to our children.\r\nWe are at the proverbial crossroads of international\r\ninteraction. We stand here today to commemorate 50\r\nyears of partnership, of survival and of triumph — our\r\nfailures notwithstanding. The historic task for us at this\r\npresent moment is to define the way forward with clarity\r\nof vision and purposeful determination.\r\nAs I stated in my address to the fiftieth regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly this past month, my\r\nGovernment believes that the United Nations is a people’s\r\nOrganization. The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\ncalls for concerted action to minimize political and\r\neconomic instability, to eradicate social violence, to\r\nprotect and preserve the environment and save our planet\r\nearth, to provide some support against the effects of\r\nnatural disasters, and to stop the ever-increasing\r\noccurrence of ethnic conflicts.\r\nMy Government is proud to support the United\r\nNations in its appeals to all nations to respect\r\nfundamental human rights and to accept differences of\r\nopinion, be they individual, ethnic or national.\r\nThe time has come for us to address holistically the\r\neconomic inequalities within the world system which\r\nallow certain ideas and policies to prevail over others\r\nwhile those which are indigenous and region-specific are\r\nignored.\r\nWe celebrate a half-century dedicated to the pursuit\r\nof world peace and, yes, we must praise those who\r\ncreated the Organization to prevent global war. However,\r\nit is a matter of regret that nations today continue to arm\r\nthemselves with weapons of mass destruction. As the war\r\nmachinery continues to thrive, thousands of helpless\r\npeople die of starvation each year.\r\nIn 50 years, the structure of the United Nations has\r\nhardly changed. Yet its circumstances have changed\r\nbeyond anything its founders would recognize. In this\r\nnew era, in the approaching millennium, we need a new\r\ndispensation. We should endeavour to make the Security\r\nCouncil more representative of and responsive to the\r\nmembership. It is time for the developing world to\r\nbecome permanent members of the Security Council. The\r\ngoal of appropriate representation should guide our efforts\r\nto ensure that all the peoples of the world, which have\r\nobserved the principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, are welcomed into this fraternity of nations.\r\nWhen we speak of peace, we are also emphasizing\r\nthe overwhelming question of our national security. I call\r\n50\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\non all countries to join forces to combat the illegal\r\ninternational narcotics trade and its attendant ills, which\r\nrepresent the major obstacle to sustainable development and\r\nsecurity in small States. Such obstacles must be on the\r\nagenda of the United Nations in the years to come. As we\r\nlook to the future, let us continue to recognize the\r\nfundamental role of women in our societies. We must\r\nensure that they take their rightful place as partners in\r\nsecuring a better future for us all. We are not doing them\r\na favour. On the contrary, we are according them the\r\nrespect and rights they are due.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, let us not only boast\r\nof great technological marvels, of man’s journey into deep\r\nspace; let us also be able to boast of children who no\r\nlonger die of hunger, no longer die of avoidable and\r\ncurable diseases and in war. We need true partnership and\r\ncooperation among all the peoples of the world in order to\r\naddress the problem of worsening poverty.\r\nAs we embark upon the second half of the first 100\r\nyears of the United Nations, let us use this occasion to\r\nchallenge ourselves and this great institution to continue\r\nworking towards the elimination of war, of hunger, of\r\ndiscrimination and of poverty in this, our global village.\r\nHappy birthday, United Nations; may God bless the\r\nUnited Nations not only for another 50 years, but for\r\nanother hundred years and beyond.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Daniel Kablan Duncan,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Daniel Kablan Duncan,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Daniel Kablan Duncan, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Duncan (interpretation from French): When His\r\nExcellency Mr. Henri Konan Bedie, President of the\r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire, named me to represent him at\r\nthe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, he instructed me to say how much he regretted\r\nthat he was unable to be here owing to the general\r\nelections under way at home. My pride in representing\r\nhim at this meeting stems from the fact that the President\r\nof the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire and the Ivorian nation\r\nattach great importance to the United Nations whose\r\nideals, enshrined in the Charter, are the founding\r\nprinciples of our country.At this solemn meeting, I should\r\nlike, on behalf of the Ivorian Government, to renew our\r\nunswerving devotion to these universal principles and our\r\ndetermination to see them strengthened still further with\r\nevery passing day.\r\nWhen its Minister for Foreign Affairs, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy presided over the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, Côte d’Ivoire sought\r\nthrough him to demonstrate its interest in and dedication\r\nto an institution which, in turn, has confidence in us.\r\nCertain failures notwithstanding, the Organization\r\nhas achieved laudable successes. We can therefore be\r\nlegitimately proud of our Organization because it is the\r\ninstitution that has made it possible to forge general\r\nconsensus on issues of global policy. It is, moreover, the\r\nonly structure capable of bringing about the\r\nimplementation of and respect for the great principles of\r\nlaw, thanks simply to the universality of its Charter.\r\nToday, the question is how to reform the United\r\nNations. Our Organization, a mirror on the world, must,\r\n50 years after its creation, still be able to play the role\r\nassigned to it while adapting to the changes of our times.\r\nAs we see it, it is therefore essential to attune our\r\nOrganization better to the new international context by\r\nmobilizing States and public opinion around new\r\nobjectives based on one observation, namely that the\r\npurposes of the Organization has evolved and broadened\r\nenormously, and many new imperatives have emerged,\r\nsuch as the need to pay more attention to preventive\r\ndiplomacy and more vigorously to promote action to\r\ndevelop the poorest countries of the world.\r\nLet us ask what today’s world would be like had the\r\nUnited Nations not existed. Let us thus agree to\r\nconsolidate the values of peace and justice that our\r\ncommon Organization stands for, as an irreplaceable tool\r\n— but one susceptible of improvement — to enable the\r\nuniversal conscience to carve out a path straddling the\r\ndivergent interests of States.\r\nUrged on by the United Nations, the global village\r\nhas become reality. But, unfortunately, we are not all\r\nhoused in the same accommodation in this village.\r\n51\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nGrappling with unprecedented economic difficulties,\r\nAfrican countries have become marginalized and see\r\nthemselves pushed further away with each passing day,\r\nwhile the concept of solidarity is being chipped away and\r\nthe wealthiest are tending to sequester themselves. In this\r\ncontext, the idea, once again stated in “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”, of establishing a partnership among the rich\r\nand poor with a view to development takes on its full\r\nmeaning and deserves our support.\r\nAbove and beyond expeditious statements, it should be\r\nnoted that this anniversary is being commemorated against\r\nthe backdrop of financial crisis. When you analyse it, this\r\nis a contributions crisis. The richest countries in resources\r\nare reticent with regard to discharging fully their\r\nobligations, while it can be seen that the vast majority of\r\npoor countries are conscientiously, and always with\r\ndifficulty, striving to find the funds, which is no mean feat\r\nin their precarious economies.\r\nAt this crucial juncture in its life the United Nations\r\nmust place special emphasis on equality and complementary\r\nbetween civil and political rights on the one hand, and\r\neconomic, social and cultural rights on the other. Thus,\r\neven in the United Nations, we must not allow the concept\r\nof the sovereign equality of Member States to be impaired\r\nbecause of the responsibilities certain large States are\r\nassuming. The United Nations must contribute to the\r\nemergence of an international civil society.\r\nToday, the poverty and want that are the lot of many\r\nunderdeveloped countries are the most distressing factors of\r\nour civilization, and they are the true breeding grounds of\r\ntension and post-cold-war conflicts — by which I mean\r\nethnic-religious clashes and their accompanying traffic in\r\ndrugs and arms, corruption and money laundering.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, nation-States and civil\r\nsocieties have been given a historic opportunity to set in\r\ntrain the vast reform needed to change the lot of all\r\nmankind. This great reform is the key to preserving the\r\nstill-fresh values of peace, justice and solidarity. For the\r\nUnited Nations it must be “the” challenge, the challenge of\r\nthe next century whose advent we await with such\r\nanticipation.\r\nTo conclude, I should like to express the gratitude of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire to the specialized agencies present in our\r\ncountry. Their support and their dedication are greatly\r\nappreciated by all Ivorians. On behalf of the President of\r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Henri\r\nKonan Bedie, I should like to tell them here how deeply\r\ngratified we are by the enormous task they have\r\naccomplished for our development.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minster of the\r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Daniel Kablan Duncan, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar\r\nKeita, Prime Minister of the Republic of Mali\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mali.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mali, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Keita (interpretation from French): It is a great\r\nhonour for me to speak in this Hall before the\r\nrepresentatives of all the world’s peoples to celebrate\r\ntogether the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThis exceptional privilege affords me a timely opportunity\r\nto deliver, on behalf of the Republic of Mali, its people\r\nand its President, His Excellency Alpha Oumar Konaré,\r\nour Head of State, a message of hope: to see the United\r\nNations live up to the desire of twenty-first century man\r\nto live in peace and security, in social justice and human\r\ndignity.\r\nHow can we fail here to recall the action the\r\nOrganization has taken to advance the cause of the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, to eradicate colonialism and to\r\neliminate all forms of racial discrimination and\r\noppression? The United Nations has thus opened new\r\nhorizons for many countries and peoples, enabling them\r\nto cooperate and to live in brotherhood within a\r\ncommunity of interests and fortunes that inspires each\r\npeople to devote its resources and energy to development,\r\nprogress and prosperity.\r\nToday, thanks to achievements of human intelligence\r\nand thought, the sense of insecurity is more often the\r\nproduct of the concerns of daily life than of the fear of\r\nsome global cataclysm. Thus, the importance Mali\r\nattaches to the definition of a new social covenant that\r\nwill put a higher priority on international solidarity, as\r\nPresident Alpha Oumer Konaré said in his statement at\r\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development.\r\n52\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nTo that end we must readjust our thinking about the\r\nconcept of development, putting greater stress on its human\r\ndimension. That is why we take pleasure in hailing the\r\nongoing reform of United Nations organs, especially those\r\nresponsible for economic and social development.\r\nAll these factors demonstrate that the United Nations\r\nis determined to promote a genuine culture of development\r\nby mankind and for mankind.\r\nWe regard the necessary enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil, the rehabilitation of the role of the General\r\nAssembly and the streamlining of the Secretariat to be an\r\nexpression of a greater democratization of the United\r\nNations and a greater transparency of its bodies.\r\nAt the end of this century and the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, the Organization is faced with an\r\nunprecedented situation, for it must confront,\r\nsimultaneously, subtle and widespread challenges with\r\nmany and complex implications. The task is a pressing and\r\nurgent one. We must act swiftly and in solidarity. Our\r\ncollective future is at stake.\r\nThe President: I thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mali for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mali, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano,\r\nSecretary of State of the Holy See\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/215 B, I now call upon the next speaker, His\r\nEminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano, Secretary of State of\r\nthe Holy See.\r\nHis Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano, Secretary of\r\nState of the Holy See, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nCardinal Sodano (interpretation from French): My\r\npresence in this Assembly just a few weeks after the visit\r\nof Pope John Paul II bears witness to the esteem of the\r\nHoly See for the United Nations. Over the past 50 years the\r\nUnited Nations has been the laboratory where certain\r\naspects of international law have been refined as well as the\r\nstage for constant multilateral dialogue. It is also the centre\r\nwhere resolutions have been prepared and adopted to avoid\r\nconflicts or to resolve them by responsible mean — or yet\r\nagain to meet the demands of human rights and solidarity.\r\nWe must pay tribute to all those who have devoted\r\nthemselves — at times even at the risk of their lives —\r\nto ensuring the triumph of law and international justice.\r\nThe United Nations has thus become an\r\nindispensable instrument of dialogue and solidarity among\r\npeoples. The Holy See believes that the action of the\r\nUnited Nations is irreplaceable for the support of\r\ncountries in their efforts to strengthen peace, assure social\r\nprogress and promote liberty.\r\nIn his address on 5 October the Holy Father\r\nexpressed the wish that the Organization might grow as\r\na moral centre, as a family of nations. It can realize this\r\nmission only if each State feels that it is accepted and\r\nrecognized for what it is and is willing to give and take,\r\nand if all share the same heritage of values whose highest\r\nexpressions remain the ideals of justice, freedom, peace\r\nand solidarity.\r\nBy its presence amongst you the Holy See desires to\r\nhelp give your Organization the spiritual vigour which\r\nwill enable it more effectively to defend the principles of\r\nits fundamental Charter.\r\nHis Holiness recalled in this very Hall that\r\n“we do not live in an irrational and meaningless\r\nworld”\r\nbut that\r\n“there is a moral logic which is built into human life\r\nand which makes possible dialogue between\r\nindividuals and peoples.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 20th meeting, p. 3)\r\nThat is why the representatives of the Holy See who\r\nparticipate in your work strive to help ensure that the\r\ndecisions made will always be governed by the objective\r\ngood of all, especially of those peoples hardest hit by\r\npoverty, injustice or war, instead of being governed by\r\nselfish or nationalistic concerns or economic interests\r\nalone.\r\nAfter 50 years of existence the United Nations is\r\ncalled upon to renew its commitments to the international\r\ncommunity. It must find new ways to respond to today’s\r\nchallenges; an ethic of solidarity, a passion for peace, and\r\nthe promotion of respect for differences.\r\n53\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to thank you in the name\r\nof Pope John Paul II for the warm welcome you accorded\r\nhim and for the attention you give to the work of our\r\nObserver Mission. The voice of the Holy Father and of his\r\nrepresentatives has but one purpose: to remind everyone\r\nthat the future of humanity depends in the final analysis on\r\na willingness to live together. This is the meaning of that\r\nindispensable solidarity among brothers and sisters, all\r\ncreated in the image and likeness of God.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary of State of the\r\nHoly See for his statement.\r\nHis Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano, Secretary of\r\nState of the Holy See, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Fahad Bin Mahmoud Al\r\nSaid, Deputy Prime Minister for Council of Ministers of\r\nOman\r\nThe President: I now call on His Royal Highness\r\nFahad bin Mahmoud Al Said, Deputy Prime Minister for\r\nCouncil of Ministers of Oman.\r\nHis Royal Highness Fahad bin Mahmoud Al Said,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister for Council of Ministers of\r\nOman, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nHis Royal Highness Fahad bin Mahmoud Al Said\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): At this historic juncture, when\r\nwe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nit is a great honour for me to take this opportunity to\r\nextend to you all our warm and sincere congratulations.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman, under the dynamic leadership\r\nof His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said has been fully\r\naware, from the very beginning, of the crucial role\r\nundertaken by the United Nations since its inception in\r\n1945 in establishing a new international world order based\r\non the universal ideals of justice, equality and stability and\r\nin which development will be achieved at the economic and\r\nsocial levels.\r\nOver the past twenty-five years, thanks to those ideals\r\nand objectives, which have always been the focal points of\r\nthe country’s policy at all levels, Oman has witnessed the\r\nmost unprecedented level of economic resurgence ever\r\nachieved in its recent history, with particular focus on\r\nimproving the skills and capabilities of the Omani citizen,\r\nthe beneficiary and the maker of Oman’s development. At\r\nthe international level, my country, which remains\r\ncommitted to the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations Charter and to the norms of international law, has\r\ncooperated with the international Organization in seeking\r\nto create an equitable international world order, in\r\npromoting the efforts aimed at consolidating peace and\r\nsecurity and in spreading prosperity and stability in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe principles of Oman’s foreign policy and of its\r\ninternational relations are based on the constants of our\r\nbeliefs and culture as well as on the common good of\r\nhumanity. On this basis, my country has managed to\r\nresolve all outstanding issues with neighbouring countries\r\nby peaceful means on the basis of mutual respect and\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\r\nFurthermore, Oman has effectively contributed to the\r\npeaceful settlement of many of the contentious global\r\nconflicts and has played an extensive role in international\r\nconferences and meetings held in order to reach a\r\ncommon understanding of international issues. Oman’s\r\nparticipation, as a non-permanent member, in the\r\nactivities of the Security Council, and its cooperation with\r\nother Member States in dealing with international\r\nchallenges and conflicts have afforded Oman a good\r\nopportunity to play its proper role in international affairs\r\nwith particular emphasis on addressing persistent\r\nproblems in many parts of the world.\r\nThe past epoch of the United Nations history has\r\nbeen a period of many a positive achievement thanks to\r\nthe effectiveness of multilateral action. The fact that the\r\nUnited Nations has been able to surmount the many great\r\ndifficulties that stood in its path attests to the success of\r\nthe Organization and its Member States. However, the\r\nachievement of peace, security, economic prosperity and\r\nsocial well-being on a basis of equality and justice will\r\nnot be possible unless we strengthen our collective efforts\r\nand give priority to development plans on the individual\r\nand the collective levels.\r\nIn the light of the changed international priorities\r\nand concerns, the Organization has convened many an\r\ninternational conference to cope with the many problems\r\nthat beset mankind, the most important of which are those\r\nrelating to population, environment, development,\r\ndesertification, drought, and other areas. If these problems\r\nare not dealt with seriously and solutions found for them,\r\nthey will have the same devastating effects of world wars.\r\nThe new international order must be characterized by\r\ncooperation and should accord priority to finding\r\nsolutions to the economic problems that face certain\r\n54\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nStates. That is why it is opportune to undertake efforts to\r\nenable many countries of the world to use modern\r\ntechnology in developing their resources and improving\r\ntheir economies in the interest of their people.\r\nIt is an honour for me to have the opportunity, on\r\nbehalf of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, to take part\r\nin this historic occasion which marks the beginning of a\r\nnew era in the march of the world’s peoples towards a\r\nbetter future.\r\nIn conclusion, I shall like to pay tribute, for their\r\nefforts, to the Secretaries-General who have successively\r\nmanaged the affairs of the United Nations as well as the\r\nstaff of the United Nations from 1945 up to this day. Their\r\npioneering efforts have been instrumental in making the\r\nmission of the United Nations successful.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for\r\nCabinet Affairs of Oman for his statement.\r\nHis Royal Highness Fahad bin Mahmoud Al Said,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister for Council of Ministers of\r\nOman, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Professor\r\nGuido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Malta and former President of\r\nthe General Assembly\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Professor Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta and\r\nformer President of the General Assembly.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Professor Guido de\r\nMarco, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Malta and former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. De Marco: The United Nations is a direct\r\nproduct of mankind’s most bitter and cruellest experience:\r\nthe Second World War. In establishing the United Nations,\r\nmankind sought to distance itself from the risks inherent in\r\nextreme nationalism to move to a higher plane of\r\ninternational action. More than an institution, the United\r\nNations should be seen as a process encompassing\r\nmankind’s deepest aspirations for global peace, human\r\nrights and democratic freedoms.\r\nThe past 50 years have both tested and reinvigorated\r\nthe United Nations. At the institutional level, particular\r\nsegments may have suffered, but in substance our\r\nOrganization has resisted the impact of events and\r\nsurvived the challenges of change. At the operational\r\nlevel, the Organization is still struggling to confirm its\r\ncredibility in fulfilling the aspirations of peoples and\r\nnations.\r\nAs much as a commemoration of the past, today’s\r\nevent is a dedication to the future.\r\nToday mankind has the power to dominate and\r\ncontrol much of the external environment. It has yet to\r\nrefine those values which determine the use of this force.\r\nOur time is marked by tragic contradictions. When\r\nthe potential to produce food is practically unlimited,\r\nmillions still suffer from malnutrition, and thousands of\r\nchildren die daily of starvation. When medicine can\r\nmiraculously save lives and significantly extend life\r\nexpectancy, millions needlessly fall victim to curable\r\ndiseases because they are denied basic health care. When\r\na growing portion of mankind rides together the electronic\r\ninformation highway, hatred and fear still separate\r\ncommunities and thousands are slaughtered in ethnic\r\nconflicts. When the holistic wonder of our globe can be\r\nseen and admired from outer space, irresponsible\r\ndevelopment still attacks and ravages the natural\r\nenvironment.\r\nWithin this perspective, institutional bickering fades\r\ninto insignificance.\r\nUltimately, it is our unified support and political\r\ncommitment to the principles and ideals enshrined in the\r\nCharter that determine the relevance, validity and\r\neffectiveness of our Organization.\r\nThe spreading of a poverty curtain, of which we\r\nwarned five years ago, has become more pronounced and\r\nmore ruthless. Our effort to consolidate human dignity is\r\nstill eroded by the culture of death peddled by drug\r\ntraffickers. Our intent to buttress the rule of law is still\r\nundermined by international crime.\r\nUniversality is the keystone of the United Nations.\r\nThe notion of universality has consistently guided Malta’s\r\naction within this Organization. It inspires our role in the\r\npursuit of global and regional peace and cooperation. It\r\nunderpinned our effort to promote and develop the\r\nconcept of the common heritage of mankind in the\r\ncontext of the law of the sea and the concerns over\r\nclimate change. It continues to motivate us in our role as\r\n55\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nguardians and trustees of the rights and interests of future\r\ngenerations by giving the Trusteeship Council the role of\r\ncoordinating international efforts to maintain their legacy.\r\nIn our efforts to review the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, the equal rights of nations, large and small,\r\nmust be borne in mind.\r\nWe believe, and have always maintained, that there\r\nhas to be a revitalization of the role of the General\r\nAssembly, the only organ in which we are all permanent\r\nmembers. In the restructuring of the Security Council, a\r\nsymbiotic relationship between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly is of the essence.\r\nThese first 50 years have shown that the moral and\r\npolitical foundations of the United Nations are rooted in\r\nideals and aspirations which go beyond a simple aggregate\r\nof membership and the search for pragmatic solutions to\r\nspecific and immediate problems. The whole is more than\r\nthe sum of its parts.\r\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations hitched\r\ntheir wagon to a star in charting the course of the future.\r\nThis global vision rests and depends on the recognition of\r\nand respect for the rights, freedoms and dignity of each and\r\nevery human being.\r\nIn building a second-generation United Nations, the\r\nmain ingredients remain our will and commitment. This\r\nprocess requires our engagement to ensure the political and\r\nfinancial support for the Organization to act in order to\r\nhave a world which is free from want and to ensure peace\r\nand freedom.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Malta and former President\r\nof the General Assembly of the United Nations for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Professor Guido de\r\nMarco, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Malta and former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Farouk Al-Shara’,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nFarouk Al-Shara’, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Farouk Al-Shara’, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Al-Shara’ (interpretation from Arabic): The\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United\r\nNations poses a legitimate question. The question is not\r\nabout the world body’s achievements to date, which have\r\nbeen important enough but, rather, about what should we\r\ndo within the framework of the Organization in order for\r\nit to be able to build for mankind a better future in which\r\nthere would be no place for aggression, occupation,\r\njustice, poverty or underdevelopment.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, the international scene\r\nhas been in a state of transition. No one can predict what\r\nthis transition will lead to or when it will end as it is\r\ncharacterized by murkiness and instability.\r\nThis is a transition from a world order whose\r\ncollapse left behind a great deal of rubble, many wars and\r\nseveral fundamental questions, to an alternative order that\r\nis still struggling to rise from under the rubble, still trying\r\nto find ways to put out the fires that continue to rage in\r\nmany places, and trying to find answers to the many\r\nquestions that have remained unanswered.\r\nThis is a daunting task and a heavy responsibility\r\nthat no one individual State can successfully face up to,\r\nno matter how powerful or wise it may be. Rather, it\r\nrequires collective sincere efforts by the Member States,\r\nefforts that should be immune against the mentality of the\r\ncold war and the ambitions of hegemony.\r\nIt is, therefore, our view that the United Nations\r\ncontinues to be the best framework for mobilizing such\r\nefforts and contributions in the face of present and future\r\nchallenges. It would be wrong to believe that a new world\r\norder has risen already and has become a fait accompli,\r\nor that we have to either board the train or miss it. Syria,\r\nin the words of President Hafez Al-Assad, like many\r\nother States of the world, will not support an international\r\norder in which it has no role and no interest. Those who\r\nhave followed the deliberations of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement Summit held last week in Colombia, can\r\nclearly reach the same conclusion.\r\nConsequently, we shall continue, together with\r\ndeveloping countries and with others, to seek to contribute\r\nto the creation of a just international order that would\r\nrecognize the equality between States and peoples and\r\ntheir right to dignity, freedom and development and put\r\n56\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nits faith in international cooperation based on mutual\r\nrespect among States and the non-interference in their\r\ninternal affairs.\r\nThis gathering, which brings together such a large\r\nnumber of Heads of State and Governments on this fiftieth\r\nanniversary, reflects two important facts. The first is that\r\nthere is a state of general anxiety shared by both winners\r\nand losers in the aftermath of the cold war.\r\nThe second fact is that a unanimity has crystallized of\r\nlate among the States of the world on the need to reform\r\nthe United Nations, to render it more efficient in rising to\r\npresent and future challenges.\r\nImprovement of the performance of the United\r\nNations and the democratization of decision-making within\r\nit, cannot be attained if the stronger and richer States\r\nimpose their selfish interests at the expense of those of the\r\noverwhelming majority of the world’s countries. It is the\r\ntendency to do just that which lies at the source of the\r\ngenuine concern that has been generated by certain recent\r\npractices and experiences.\r\nThe decision in May of this year to indefinitely extend\r\nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with the\r\naccompanying exceptions entrenching the monopoly of\r\nthose possessing nuclear weapons and the pressures brought\r\nto bear on those who do not possess them and who\r\nsincerely wish to rid mankind of nuclear weapons, was the\r\nstarkest proof of this tendency which highlights the dangers\r\ninherent in the duality of standards and concepts prevailing\r\nin contemporary international relations.\r\nSince its creation, the United Nations has played an\r\nimportant role in decolonization and eliminating racism. It\r\nhas scored great successes in this regard, the latest being\r\nthe brilliant achievement in South Africa. In our region,\r\nhowever, Israel, despite paying lip service to peace,\r\ncontinues to occupy Arab lands, it continues to build\r\nsettlements on those lands and continues to sow the seeds\r\nof resentment and hatred throughout the region.\r\nIt is no secret that Israel does not want the United\r\nNations and refuses to give it a role in bringing peace to\r\nthe Middle East. Thus, the United States peace initiative\r\nwas the potential means to convince Israel to withdraw\r\nfrom all the Arab lands it occupied in 1967 in order to\r\nachieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\r\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978), as well as the land-for-peace\r\nformula.\r\nAfter four years of negotiations, however, it has\r\nbecome clear that Israel used the American initiative, first\r\nto rid itself of the United Nations; second, to hamstring\r\nthe American initiative itself; and, last but not least, to\r\nprevent the achievement of a just and comprehensive\r\npeace in the region.\r\nToday, Israel’s Government is trying to give the\r\nworld the impression that it has gone a long way towards\r\nachieving peace and forging relations in our region, while\r\nthe very peoples of the region — Arabs and Israelis alike\r\n— realize that peace is still out of reach. The real\r\nenemies of peace are those who annexed Al-Quds and the\r\nGolan; those who encouraged the continuation of\r\noccupation, colonial settlement and blind extremism; those\r\nwho continue to reject complete withdrawal for complete\r\nand comprehensive peace as proposed by Syria and\r\nsupported by the Arabs and the world.\r\nIf this opportunity for peace is lost — and we hope\r\nthat it will not be — Israel will bear a heavy\r\nresponsibility in the eyes of the world; the world that has,\r\non this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, declared\r\nits strong yearning for comprehensive peace on the basis\r\nof justice and equality and for a better future for the\r\npeoples of our region and of the whole planet.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Syrian Arab Republic for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Farouk Al-Shara’, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Al-Habib ben Yahia,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nAl-Habib ben Yahia, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nTunisia.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Al-Habib ben Yahia, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Tunisia, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. ben Yahia (interpretation from Arabic): I have\r\nthe honour to read the following message from His\r\nExcellency Zina el-Abidina ben Ali, President of the\r\nRepublic of Tunisia on this historic occasion:\r\n“At the time that the United Nations is\r\ncommemorating its fiftieth anniversary, I take great\r\n57\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\npleasure on behalf of Tunisia in extending greetings to\r\nyour august Assembly and in wishing you further\r\nsuccess in what you are doing to strengthen this\r\nedifice that is our Organization, while consolidating its\r\nprogress towards the realization of the aspirations of\r\nmankind and the ideals of peace, justice and the well-\r\nbeing of all, thanks to a convergence of views and a\r\npooling of the efforts of all. Our highest hopes are to\r\nsee solidarity and understanding triumph over\r\ndissension and conflict.\r\n“The United Nations has done a great deal in the\r\nservice of peace since its establishment in the difficult\r\ntimes that followed in the wake of World War II. It\r\nhas saved humanity from destruction and contributed\r\nto the emergence of the national liberation movement\r\nin various parts of the world. It has championed the\r\nadvocates of fraternity and equality against the forces\r\nof injustice and every form of discrimination.\r\n“Notwithstanding the difficulties that faced it, the\r\nUnited Nations has shown itself to be the very\r\nembodiment of human wisdom, and has demonstrated,\r\nthrough the many conventions, instruments and\r\ninternational machineries, and through its many\r\noutstanding efforts and activities in various areas, the\r\ngreat value of combining the soundness of its\r\nfoundations with the loftiness of its objectives.\r\n“Our Organization has strengthened itself by\r\nestablishing the many specialized bodies and agencies,\r\nto which it entrusted the responsibility of supporting\r\nnational efforts in combating illiteracy, poverty and\r\ndisease, in consolidation of the foundations of peace\r\nand international cooperation, and in search for the\r\nmeans of putting progress within the reach of all those\r\nwho seek it.\r\n“That is why we pay special tribute to all those\r\nbodies and agencies of the Organization and renew\r\nour support for them in order for them to persevere in\r\ntheir humanitarian mission. Since independence,\r\nTunisia has valued this mission of the United Nations,\r\nand has accorded to the principles embodied in the\r\nOrganization’s Charter a very high place in its\r\nnational scale of values. In this, we have been inspired\r\nby our strong resolve to shoulder, within the context\r\nof United Nations activity, the responsibility of\r\ndefending the cause of right and justice the world\r\nover.\r\n“That was the reason why Tunisia was one of\r\nthe first countries to respond to the late Dag\r\nHammarskjöld’s call to participate in the first United\r\nNations peace-keeping operation ever, in the Congo.\r\nFive years after Tunisia’s independence, the late Al-\r\nMongui Selim, one of our outstanding diplomats,\r\npresided over the 16th session of the General\r\nAssembly and was thus the first son of Africa to\r\nhold that post.\r\n“Proceeding from the choices of our people, we\r\nhave striven, since November 1987, to promote\r\nthose choices in line with humanity’s ambition to\r\nuphold freedoms in their widest sense and in\r\nconsonance with the belief that man was born free\r\nas the great reformers in our age-old civilization\r\nhave taught us.\r\n“Thus while we are focused on consolidating\r\nthe foundations of democracy at the national level\r\nand on institutionalizing respect for human rights at\r\nall levels, we have striven to spread the culture of\r\ntolerance and solidarity among our children — boys\r\nand girls alike. At the same time, we have spared no\r\neffort in supporting every step taken by the United\r\nNations to disseminate those values. We are\r\ndetermined to continue to deploy efforts in this\r\ndirection in consonance with our belief that man’s\r\nmost worthy endeavour is that which aims at\r\nbenefiting his fellow-man.\r\n“We believe that mankind has embarked on a\r\nstage in its history that affords it unprecedented\r\nopportunities to achieve a level of constructive\r\ncooperation it has never attained before, especially\r\nafter the end of bipolarity, and with the more\r\neffective communications technologies that are now\r\navailable to it. We now have an opportunity to\r\npromote dialogue, understanding and cooperation\r\nbetween cultures and peoples in the interests of\r\nworld peace.\r\n“The international community is duty-bound to\r\ntake advantage of these factors, and to forge them\r\ninto useful tools in building a world order that\r\nwould be based on peace, justice, equity and respect\r\nfor law and international legality. This has been the\r\npurpose of our efforts in all international forums in\r\nconsonance with the tendency enshrined in “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”, provided by the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutro Boutros-Ghali.\r\n58\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\n“We in Tunisia are well aware of this\r\nconcomitance of peace and development. The future\r\nof peace and democracy depends, both at the level of\r\nindividual societies and at the level of various peoples,\r\non our ability to respond to the exigencies of\r\ncomprehensive and sustainable development at the\r\nnational, regional and global levels.\r\n“Proceeding from our belief that peace is not\r\nmerely the prevention of armed conflict and the\r\nresolution of crises but is also the eradication of their\r\nroot causes, we are of the opinion that the best way of\r\ndoing that is to create a close link between\r\ndevelopment efforts, enlightenment, enshrinement of\r\nhuman rights and the values of democracy side by\r\nside with the virtues of tolerance and moderation.\r\n“Tunisia is acutely aware of the threats posed to\r\nthe safety of human society by terrorism, organized\r\ncrime, drug trafficking, the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment, the spread of disease and the\r\nreappearance of certain pandemics and of the fact that\r\nsuch threats could never stop at the national\r\nboundaries of States. Proceeding from this awareness,\r\nwe have spread no effort, especially during our\r\nChairmanship of the Organization of African Unity, in\r\ntrying to highlight the terrible consequences of these\r\nscourges, and in calling for the adoption of joint\r\npolicies, at the regional level, to control them and stop\r\ntheir spread. We have also been striving, in the\r\ncontext of international institutions, to develop specific\r\nmeans of achieving worldwide coordination and\r\ncooperation to deal with and eradicate those scourges.\r\n“These are enormous and urgent tasks, which no\r\nState can undertake on its own. They are the\r\nresponsibility of the international community as a\r\nwhole. Today, the international community has no\r\nchoice but to combine its efforts, speedily and with\r\nthe necessary efficacy, to maintain peace, stability and\r\nprosperity, while consolidating the positive changes\r\nwhich have been achieved the world over and from\r\nwhich humanity is entitled to expect dividends.\r\n“No one can doubt that the United Nations is still\r\nthe most appropriate means for the attainment of\r\nhuman solidarity in the context of a comprehensive\r\ncontract of peace and development\u0027. That is the thrust\r\nof the appeal we have been making from this rostrum.\r\nWe did so in 1989, convinced as we were of the need\r\nto formulate and implement an international plan to\r\ndeal with the scourge of worldwide poverty and\r\nhunger.\r\n“There can be no doubt that our hopes for the\r\nUnited Nations and the responsibilities we assign to\r\nit make it incumbent upon us all to strive to ensure\r\nthat its principles are abided by, to support its efforts\r\nand to strengthen its means of action. The Tunisia of\r\nthe new era is convinced that the Organization is\r\nstill very definitely the ideal framework to deal with\r\ninternational problems, safeguard peace and stability\r\nthroughout the world and promote cooperation\r\nbetween nations for the benefit of all.”\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Tunisia for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ben Yahia, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Tunisia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Shaikh Mohamed Bin\r\nMubarak Al-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBahrain and Special Envoy of His Highness the Amir\r\nof the State of Bahrain\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Shaikh\r\nMohamed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Bahrain and Special Envoy of His Highness the\r\nAmir of the State of Bahrain.\r\nHis Excellency Shaikh Mohamed Bin Mubarak Al-\r\nKhalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain and\r\nSpecial Envoy of His Highness the Amir of the State\r\nof Bahrain, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nShaikh Mohamed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): It gives me pleasure to\r\naddress this international gathering today as the\r\nrepresentative of His Highness Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al-\r\nKhalifa, the Amir of the State of Bahrain, and to convey\r\nto all participants His Highness the Amir’s greetings and\r\nhis sincere wishes for the success of this celebration and\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nOur international Organization is commemorating,\r\nand with it we are celebrating, the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nits establishment in the wake of the Second World War\r\nwhich the international community and all peace-loving\r\nnations had resolved to make the last destructive war in\r\nthe history of mankind. Through the Charter and noble\r\nprinciples of the United Nations, they determined to erase\r\n59\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nthe consequences of that war and the destruction that it\r\nbrought about.\r\nOn this occasion, of which we are all proud, and in\r\nthe presence of this high-level assemblage, we express our\r\ngratitude for those who contributed to the creation of this\r\ninternational edifice through their distinguished thoughts\r\nand magnanimity and for those who, up to the present, have\r\ncarried the banner or sacrificed their lives in the cause of\r\nsecurity, peace and the promotion of justice, prosperity and\r\nstability for the peoples of the world.\r\nMr. Figueres Olsen (President of Costa Rica), Vice-\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, took the Chair.\r\nThe fact that this remarkable anniversary is taking\r\nplace at a time when the human race is looking forward to\r\na new century of civilization heightens its significance and\r\nplaces the great responsibility on us, States and peoples, of\r\nmeeting this crossroads together in a manner commensurate\r\nwith the challenges before us and the aspirations of all our\r\npeoples.\r\nIn an era fraught with developments and successive\r\nand accelerated changes, this anniversary serves as a timely\r\nopportunity for all the Governments and peoples of the\r\nworld to reflect upon the performance, in terms of both its\r\nachievements and failures, of this 50-year-old Organization.\r\nIt is also an occasion for all of them to present their visions\r\nand thoughts on how the Organization can best evolve to\r\ncope with the world’s enormous political, economic, social\r\nand cultural events and changes, while drawing object-\r\nlessons from the missteps and pitfalls of the past by seeking\r\nto restructure the United Nations so as to allow it to keep\r\npace with the age.\r\nTo that end, efforts should be made to reinvigorate the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in which all Member States are\r\nrepresented. Moreover, the Security Council’s effectiveness\r\nshould be enhanced through the expansion of its\r\nmembership and the implementation of every means of\r\nimproving its efficiency. In that context, it is also crucial\r\nthat we strengthen the role of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in order to allow it to function effectively in\r\npromoting the welfare of all peoples. It is neither\r\nreasonable nor acceptable that one-fifth of the world’s\r\npopulation of approximately 6 billion should continue to\r\nlive in abject poverty. Concerted efforts are therefore\r\nessential to address this problem. Social and economic well-\r\nbeing and freedom from hunger, disease, illiteracy and\r\nunemployment are fundamental if prosperity is to be\r\nattained.\r\nThe United Nations has passed many a test and has\r\ndemonstrated, since its establishment, that it is quite\r\ncapable of surmounting crises and facing up to any\r\nchallenge that contravenes the principles of its Charter\r\nand runs counter to its noble objectives. One of the most\r\noutstanding achievements of the United Nations has been\r\nits success in putting an end to colonialism and to\r\napartheid. The Organization’s activities in the area of\r\nmaintaining peace and security in the world are increasing\r\nand there seems to be general support for the\r\nrecommendations put forward by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis “An Agenda for Peace”, as discussions in the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and other bodies have\r\nshown, in particular with respect to efforts to encourage\r\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and to\r\nprevent conflicts in the framework of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping and peace-building. The world\r\nnow yearns for a new age of peace and comprehensive\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBoth the State of Bahrain, whose national\r\nindependence was associated with the positive role of the\r\nUnited Nations in enabling peoples to enjoy self-\r\ndetermination, and the Gulf region, which a few years ago\r\nwitnessed the formation of the greatest international\r\nalliance in history to deter aggression and uphold\r\ninternational legality, are living testimony to our\r\ninternational Organization’s success in achieving stability\r\nand peace in a vital region of the world, whose security\r\nrequires respect for existing boundaries at all times and\r\ncommitment to the norms and principles of international\r\nlegality at all levels. There is no doubt that the\r\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\r\nthe Middle East, with the participation of all parties, will\r\nbe one of the United Nations most important\r\nachievements.\r\nThe future of the United Nations depends now more\r\nthan ever on the extent of its ability to influence events\r\nand to mould the future, especially in an era of\r\naccelerating change and development influenced by the\r\ndramatic communications revolution in the world. If this\r\nOrganization is to carry out its task of peacemaking and\r\nensuring the prevalence of justice, it behoves us, peoples\r\nand Governments alike, to present the twenty-first century\r\nwith a United Nations capable of promoting the causes of\r\njustice, development and equality for all.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain and\r\nSpecial Envoy of His Highness, the Amir of the State of\r\nBahrain, for his statement.\r\n60\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nHis Excellency Shaikh Mohamed Bin Mubarak Al-\r\nKhalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain and\r\nSpecial Envoy of His Highness, the Amir of the State\r\nof Bahrain, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Dawa Tsering, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Bhutan\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Dawa Tsering, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Bhutan.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dawa Tsering, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Bhutan, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Tsering: I have the honour to convey to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, and through him to all\r\nrepresentatives, the warm greetings and good wishes of His\r\nMajesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, for the\r\nsuccess of the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy delegation is proud to join the other nations of the\r\nworld in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. The fact that so many Heads of State and\r\nGovernment are here today is eloquent testimony to the\r\nimportance of the United Nations in the life of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bhutan has always remained a\r\nsovereign, independent nation throughout its long history,\r\nalthough we too have suffered at the hands of an imperial\r\nPower. The unique Mahayana Buddhist civilization which\r\nflourished in the Himalayas from the seventh century A.D.\r\nonwards, and of which Bhutan is the last remaining bastion,\r\nhas enriched the lives of our people and given strength and\r\nresilience to our society down the ages. Every Bhutanese is\r\nproud of his rich cultural heritage and pristine natural\r\nenvironment. Although Bhutan is a small, underdeveloped\r\ncountry, difficult of access, landlocked and mountainous,\r\nwe do possess profound spiritual truths and traditional\r\nknowledge in alternative medicine which we wish to share\r\nwith the rest of the world. We are also keen to make our\r\nown modest contribution to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and to the promotion of the unity,\r\nfriendship and well-being of the entire human family.\r\nThe United Nations means different things to different\r\nnations around the globe. It is only natural that we should\r\nview the world through our own perspective, influenced by\r\nour historical experience, geographical setting, traditions\r\nand value system, and compulsions arising out of the\r\naspirations of our people for political and cultural\r\nsurvival. For a small nation like Bhutan, membership of\r\nthe United Nations enables us to participate in shaping the\r\ninternational agenda on numerous issues that are of\r\nimportance to our people, ranging from population,\r\nenvironment, poverty, disarmament and social\r\ndevelopment to protection of cultural heritage. We benefit\r\nfrom the activities of the United Nations family of\r\norganizations, whose assistance has made a real difference\r\nin the everyday lives of our people.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations is an occasion, not only of joy and\r\ncelebration, but also of thought and reflection. The\r\nachievements of the United Nations are far too numerous\r\nto belittle. Whether as an instrument of peaceful change\r\nin ideologies and political systems during the past 50\r\nyears, or as a formulator of international principles and\r\nstandards on a wide range of matters, of which the\r\nCharter is the centrepiece, its achievements are impressive\r\nby any yardstick. The United Nations has helped to mould\r\nthe international agenda on numerous issues and given\r\nlegitimacy to many new doctrines and ideas. The end of\r\nthe cold war gives us hope that we can build on the\r\nshared norms and values of the United Nations and strive\r\nfor higher standards in international relations in order to\r\nachieve collective security and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment in a better-ordered world.\r\nOn the historic occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, as the world reflects on the past half\r\ncentury and looks to the future, it is fitting to review the\r\ncase for reforming and restructuring the United Nations.\r\nIts present structure and distribution of powers was\r\nconceived 50 years ago when it had a membership of\r\nonly some 50 countries. Since then, the membership has\r\nnearly quadrupled. However, the interests of the vast\r\nmajority of the members are not represented in the\r\nSecurity Council, which is the only body of any real\r\nauthority within the system. In our view, the reform of\r\nthe United Nations must begin with the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council so that it will represent the interests of\r\nall countries equally, and not just those of a privileged\r\nfew. It is only fair and just that more equitable\r\nrepresentation of developing countries and deserving\r\ncandidates which have emerged since 1945 should now be\r\naccommodated.\r\nBhutan believes that on the basis of any objective\r\ncriteria Japan, one of the foremost economic powers of\r\nthe world today, would qualify for permanent\r\n61\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nmembership, and among developing countries India’s\r\ncandidature for permanent membership merits equal\r\nconsideration. Apart from the fact that it has a population\r\ncomprising one-sixth of mankind, a large economy with\r\nenormous potential for rapid growth, an impressive track\r\nrecord of valuable contributions to shaping the United\r\nNations’ agenda on vital issues and participation in major\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, and the ability to\r\nassume full obligations arising from permanent\r\nmembership, India’s case also merits serious consideration\r\non the basis of balanced geographical representation and\r\nequitable representation of developing countries.\r\nIn our view, the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations is also an opportune time for us to reorganize its\r\nother organs, particularly the General Assembly and its\r\ncommittees, to overcome its present inadequacies and\r\nshortcomings through a process of restructuring and\r\nrevitalization, so that our Organization can become more\r\nefficient and result-oriented to face the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bhutan for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dawa Tsering, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Bhutan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Stephen\r\nKalonzo Musyoka, M.P., Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand International Cooperation of Kenya\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency The Honourable\r\nStephen Kalonzo Musyoka, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand International Cooperation of Kenya.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Stephen Kalonzo\r\nMusyoka, M.P., Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of Kenya, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Musyoka: The founders of the United Nations\r\nwere inspired, by their strong will, to overcome the terrible\r\nexperiences of the two world wars to create a world\r\nOrganization which would ensure that such experiences\r\nwould not recur. They were inspired by their sensitivity to\r\nthe human suffering resulting from destruction by the wars\r\nto undertake ambitious reconstruction programmes which\r\nturned around the prospects for Europe within 10 short\r\nyears.\r\nThey were similarly inspired to adopt the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the Declaration against\r\ncolonialism, in support of the right of self-determination\r\nof the peoples in the colonized territories.\r\nOn this occasion, we can state with confidence that\r\nthe Organization has succeeded in the prevention of a\r\nthird world war; that it has drastically reduced inter-state\r\narmed conflicts; that it has made much progress in the\r\ncodification of international law; that it has provided a\r\nconducive climate and means for the reconstruction of\r\nEurope; that it has almost completed the mission of\r\ndecolonization; and that it has withstood the cold war.\r\nThe Organization has also done well in the coordination\r\nof international action to deal with disasters, eradication\r\nand containment of diseases, and resettlement of refugees\r\nand displaced persons.\r\nThe end of the cold war, however, has been\r\nfollowed by an unprecedented explosion of internal\r\nconflicts unleashed by the rise of ethnic and religious\r\nnationalism. The size and complexity of some of these\r\nconflicts have led to disintegration of some Member\r\nStates of this Organization. The absence of a delegation\r\nfrom Somalia eloquently testifies to this fact.\r\nThe United Nations has responded to the conflicts\r\nwith peace-keeping operations in virtually all regions of\r\nthe world. Recent experiences have exposed the strengths\r\nand weaknesses of the Organization in this critical area.\r\nEqually disquieting is the current trend towards\r\nabandonment of support for both bilateral and multilateral\r\ndevelopment programmes. It had been expected that the\r\nend of the cold war would result in huge savings from\r\ndefence budgets to be applied to development financing.\r\nHowever, what we are witnessing now, five years after\r\nthe collapse of the Berlin Wall, is an unprecedented\r\nwithdrawal of development support by the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Organization has addressed the socio-economic\r\nchallenges through, among others, conferences on:\r\npopulation, social development, the child, women, human\r\nrights, the environment, and human settlements. Plans of\r\naction adopted by these conferences are, however,\r\nseriously undermined by the withdrawal of effective\r\nsupport by the developed countries.\r\n62\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nLike the founders of the United Nations, we, as\r\ntoday’s leaders, should take full cognizance of the\r\ninseparable relationship between peace and development.\r\nWe must give impetus to our Organization to enhance its\r\ncapabilities in, among other fields: first, peaceful resolution\r\nof conflicts; second, mobilizing international support for\r\nsocio-economic development and the worldwide eradication\r\nof poverty; third, strengthening the productive capacity and\r\ncompetitiveness of the developing countries, especially in\r\nAfrica; and lastly, the progressive development and\r\napplication of international law.\r\nThe United Nations, like any other Organization, needs\r\na sound financial base in order to carry out its mandate\r\neffectively. In this regard, we urge Member States to\r\nhonour their Charter obligations by paying their assessed\r\ncontributions in full and, whenever possible, on time.\r\nMay I borrow words spoken from this very rostrum by\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II, as follows:\r\n“The United Nations needs to rise more and more\r\nabove the cold status of an administrative institution\r\nand become a moral centre where all the nations of\r\nthe world feel at home and develop a shared\r\nawareness of being, as it were, a family of nations ...\r\nIn an authentic family the strong do not dominate ...”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 20th meeting, p. 5)\r\nAs we move into the next millennium, the United\r\nNations family should be guided by the spirit of its Charter.\r\nNo member of the family need be left behind, provided we\r\nare all ever mindful of one another’s needs and sensibilities.\r\nI would have concluded at this point, but in view of a\r\nstatement made this morning I am compelled to exercise\r\nmy right of reply. President Bizimungu took advantage of\r\nthis solemn occasion to drag Kenya into Rwandan problems\r\nby making an unprovoked attack on Kenya’s Head of State.\r\nKenya firmly refuses to be drawn into Rwandan problems.\r\nWe have stated time and again that Kenya will cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal for Rwanda to ensure that justice is\r\napplied to all. In this regard, Kenya has consistently held\r\nthe view that the root causes of the Rwandan problems\r\nneed to be addressed comprehensively. It is extremely\r\nimportant that the events preceding the genocide,\r\nparticularly the shooting down of the plane which killed the\r\nPresidents of both Rwanda and Burundi in April 1994, thus\r\ntriggering genocide, be investigated and the culprits\r\npunished for their crimes.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International\r\nCooperation of Kenya for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Stephen Kalonzo\r\nMusyoka, M.P., Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of Kenya, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mouzaoir Abdallah,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nComoros\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Mouzaoir Abdallah,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nComoros.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mouzaoir Abdallah, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Comoros,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Abdallah (interpretation from French): I should\r\nlike at the outset to join my voice with those of the\r\nspeakers who preceded me in congratulating Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral on his well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of this historic session commemorating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization.\r\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations is a historic occasion, on which we wish\r\nto express our satisfaction at the indisputable role that the\r\nOrganization plays in all the areas of present international\r\nrelations.\r\nWe pay resounding tribute to the free nations that\r\nfounded the United Nations, an Organization that has\r\nbecome, over the years, a global political arena that is\r\nessential to the rapprochement of peoples.\r\nThe role of the Organization of the United Nations\r\nin decolonization, advances in international law, respect\r\nfor human rights and the identification of certain major\r\nproblems such as those relating to population and the\r\nenvironment illustrate the growing accomplishments and\r\nthe progress of our Organization.\r\nThe people of the Comoros will not forget that it is\r\nthanks to the United Nations that the legal battle relating\r\nto the boundaries of the Republic of the Comoros was\r\nwon on 12 November 1965, four months after our\r\nindependence.\r\n63\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nAs regards peace, solidarity and the right of peoples\r\nto a life of dignity and prosperity, much remains to be\r\ndone.\r\nAs to the implementation of new development\r\nstrategies to bring about a more just and equitable\r\ninternational economic order, we are obliged to note that\r\nthe gulf continues to widen between rich and poor\r\ncountries. We also note with regret that despite efforts at\r\nadjustment and at economic and financial recovery, the debt\r\nburden and the rigidity of its regulation weigh heavily on\r\nour countries.\r\nA new approach to the repayment of this debt must be\r\nsought, out of a twofold concern for humanity and\r\nsolvency. The United Nations must strive towards this,\r\notherwise small countries such as mine are likely to be\r\nexcluded completely from the broad movement of hope,\r\nresponsibility and creativity that is now taking shape and in\r\nwhich we firmly believe.\r\nThe act of aggression perpetrated against the Republic\r\nof Comoros on the night of 27 to 28 September wounded\r\nmy country and plunged it into mourning, thus aggravating\r\nan already precarious economic and social situation. I\r\nwould urgently appeal, from this lofty rostrum, that\r\neverything be done to put an end to the criminal acts of\r\ndestruction by mercenaries through determined,\r\nuncompromising and stringent international legislation.\r\nI should like to take this solemn opportunity to convey\r\nto the international community the profound gratitude of the\r\nGovernment of the National Union of Transition, headed by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Caabi Elyachroutu, and of the people\r\nof Comoros for its support and sympathy for my country\r\nduring this tragic and painful ordeal.\r\nAt this stage, I should like to reiterate our sincere\r\nthanks to the Government and the people of France. Allow\r\nme also to convey to His Excellency Mr. Jacques Chirac,\r\nPresident of the French Republic,the high esteem in which\r\nthe people of the Comoros hold him for the interest he\r\nshows in developing the ties of friendship that link our two\r\ncountries.\r\nThe determined intervention by an élite unit of the\r\nFrench Army during the night of 3 October last, pursuant\r\nto the defence accords that link the Comoros and France\r\nand at the request of Prime Minister Caabi Elyachroutu,\r\nmade it possible to restore constitutional order.\r\nLastly, I should like to pay heartfelt tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, our brother, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, for the decisive action he took at\r\nthe request of the Organization of African Unity and of\r\ncountries friendly to the Comoros, which included the\r\nUnited States of America, in the very first hours of the\r\naggression committed against my country. The Comorian\r\npeople will not forget this.\r\nOn the eve of the third millennium, my country\r\nexpresses the hope that the United Nations will become\r\nthe forum for convergence and arbitration of a world that\r\nneeds to replenish and revitalize itself, on the basis of the\r\nuniversal values of generosity, solidarity and peace, of\r\nwhich it is the worthy and legitimate guarantor.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof the Comoros for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mouzaoir Abdallah, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Comoros,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Najibullah Lafraie,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Najibullah Lafraie,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and State of Afghanistan.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Najibullah Lafraie, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and State of Afghanistan, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Lafraie: I am especially privileged to make this\r\nstatement on behalf of His Excellency Professor\r\nBurhanuddin Rabbani, President of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, while reminding the world family of the\r\nefforts made over the last 50 years to achieve global\r\npeace and stability and to ensure human rights and\r\neconomic and social progress, also offers us an\r\nopportunity to meticulously re-evaluate the extent to\r\nwhich we, the peoples of the United Nations, have\r\nfulfilled our commitments to ensure respect for the\r\nprovisions of the Charter.\r\nThe objectives and goals enshrined in the Charter are\r\nindicative of the common interest in peace, stability,\r\n64\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\ndemocracy and human rights, in preference to the\r\nillegitimate strategic goals of those enjoying better military\r\nand economic capabilities.\r\nIt is a fact that all Member States share responsibility\r\nfor the aforementioned principles. However, the prevailing\r\ninternational mechanism grants a comparatively better status\r\nto the major Powers than to other States. Thus, their resolve\r\nto remain loyal to the principles enshrined in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and to serve international peace,\r\nstability and economic development is even more vitally\r\nimportant.\r\nAfghanistan, a former Member of the League of\r\nNations, became a Member of the United Nations as early\r\nas 1946. It has all along remained loyal and committed to\r\nthe principles of the United Nations. However, when\r\nAfghanistan was invaded by the Red Army of the former\r\nSoviet Union in 1979, the United Nations did very little to\r\nrepulse the aggression. We are grateful to the United\r\nNations General Assembly for overwhelmingly condemning\r\nthe aggression. The Security Council, however, remained\r\ncompletely inactive. The reason was that the former Soviet\r\nUnion, a permanent member of the Council, could use its\r\nveto power against any decision of the Council.\r\nThat is why we, as a non-aligned country, share the\r\nviews expressed by other Member States with an emphasis\r\non the need for the democratization, transparency and\r\nreform of the Security Council, including the revision of the\r\nright of veto, which we consider as the tyranny of the\r\nminority over the majority. The veto rule can be replaced\r\nby the requirement of a two-thirds majority.\r\nWe are all well aware of the enormous sufferings of\r\nthe Afghan people during the years of Soviet occupation.\r\nThe question is why war-stricken Afghanistan is again\r\nfacing foreign conspiracies and plots stirring national and\r\nethnic hatred among its people. Is this not a crime against\r\nhumanity? Does it not clearly exemplify the violation of the\r\nprinciple of non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nothers? Do the circles in the neighbouring country who\r\nfinance, arm and train the band of the so-called Taliban\r\nknow what they stand for? They should know that they\r\nstand for extremism and obscurantism. They believe in\r\nviolence and negate every single principle of democracy\r\nand human rights. This is in contrast to the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan, which has all along proved its commitment to\r\ndemocracy, human rights and peaceful coexistence with\r\nothers, especially its neighbours, and has campaigned\r\nagainst terrorism, extremism and narcotic drugs.\r\nI should like to bring to the attention of the world\r\ncommunity the fact that right at this moment, a foreign-\r\nengineered conspiracy has once again channelled the\r\nTaliban mercenaries to the gates of the capital, Kabul.\r\nThe aim is to impose by force and violence a puppet\r\nclique against the will of our people. It is very\r\nunfortunate that the world is standing a silent spectator\r\nwitnessing the further devastation of an already war-torn\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan will continue to\r\ndefend its national sovereignty, territorial integrity and the\r\nright of its people to determine their own future. We\r\nconsider dialogue and negotiation within the framework\r\nof the United Nations peace efforts headed by the Special\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General as the best means to\r\nachieve a lasting peace in the country.\r\nWe earnestly expect the international community to\r\nrender support for the cause of peace and the prevention\r\nof further killing and destruction in Afghanistan.\r\nEach and every document of the United Nations\r\ntalks about respecting the right to life, liberty and\r\nsecurity, as well as the will of nations. During this\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting, the world leaders have\r\nalso presented speeches about the future of the world and\r\nthe ways and means of implementing the provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, which would remain merely\r\nbeautiful expressions unless translated into practice. Let\r\nus not forget, however, that at this very moment millions\r\nof human beings go on living in poverty, hunger and\r\ndeprivation and without any access to primary health care\r\nand basic education.\r\nIn spite of all these miseries inflicted on the majority\r\nof our human family, thousands of millions of dollars are\r\nbeing spent each year on the production of new and\r\nsophisticated weapons for the annihilation of our very\r\nlives.\r\nConsidering the fact that the end of polarization and\r\nthe cold war should bring considerable reductions in\r\nmilitarization, is it not time, on such a glorious occasion,\r\nto commit ourselves to donate just a small portion of\r\nthese unnecessary expenditures to the most impoverished\r\ncountries of our world family?\r\nFinally, let us pray to God Almighty for a successful\r\ncommon endeavour to see the United Nations as a more\r\njust world Organization serving as the beacon of hope for\r\nthe human family.\r\n65\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs and State of Afghanistan\r\nfor his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Najibullah Lafraie, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Afghanistan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Daudi Ngelautwa\r\nMwakawago, Chairman of the Delegation of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Daudi Ngelauta Mwakawago,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Daudi Ngelautwa Mwakawago,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nMr. Mwakawago: It is a signal honour and privilege\r\nto address this Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of my Head of State and\r\nGovernment. Let me at the outset pay tribute to you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and allow me also to express my\r\ndelegation’s sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedicated service to the\r\nworld.\r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania, in more ways than\r\none, is a product of the good work of the United Nations.\r\nThe mainland, Tanganyika, was a trusteeship Territory from\r\n1945 to 1961, having assumed that status after the collapse\r\nof the League of Nations. But even Zanzibar, which is the\r\nother component of the Union, enjoyed the support of the\r\nOrganization in its quest for liberation as a Protectorate\r\nunder the British.\r\nThus, these celebrations are Tanzania’s celebrations.\r\nWe join other similar States in paying tribute to the United\r\nNations for the sterling work it has done on decolonization.\r\nThe United Nations has done more than achieve\r\ndecolonization. Its work in many countries of the world,\r\nespecially in the South, is seen through its various agencies.\r\nAs we meet today, we look back on 50 years of\r\nillustrious history. But the main objective is to focus on the\r\nfuture. The Organization needs revitalization. One area is\r\nto democratize its structures, especially the Security\r\nCouncil, so that they reflect current realities, both in\r\nterms of membership and the scope of the issues before\r\nthe world body. It is imperative that equitable\r\ngeographical representation be at the centrepiece of\r\nreforms.\r\nThe second area of concern is development. The\r\nAssembly has heard addresses from many leaders. There\r\nis a resounding call for increased resources and a frontal\r\nattack on poverty. The scourge of poverty and\r\nenvironmental degradation is the new war facing the\r\nUnited Nations. It cannot be wished away or left to the\r\ndeveloping countries to fight it. It requires the efforts and\r\nsolidarity of the international community through the\r\nleadership of the United Nations.\r\nThe third imperative of our time is South-South\r\ncooperation. Although there is so much talk of the\r\nglobalization of the economy, unless the South gets its act\r\ntogether, it will not enjoy the benefits of globalization.\r\nSome countries in the South, especially in Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica, have made very significant progress. Their\r\nexperience and expertise are not only relevant, but can\r\nhelp to spearhead development in the South at a pace\r\ncommensurate with their traditions and values. The United\r\nNations has a role to play in facilitating that cooperation.\r\nI need hardly emphasize that the development of the\r\nSouth is negatively affected by the huge debt burden, a\r\nquestion that requires an urgent response by the creditor\r\nnations and institutions.\r\nTanzania has followed the peace-keeping process\r\nwith keen interest. We believe the success stories are\r\nthere for everyone to see. None the less, it is my\r\ndelegation’s view that the mandates need looking into. In\r\nrecent years there have been so many contradictions that\r\nhave tarnished the image of the United Nations.\r\nLastly, the Rwanda and Burundi developments have\r\nbeen debated here at length. But it is very clear to my\r\ndelegation that whatever steps will be taken to deal with\r\nthe conflict, it is absolutely necessary to address the\r\nquestion of the return of the refugees to their countries of\r\norigin. Failure to do so will only breed more conflicts in\r\nthe future. Tanzania has over one million refugees from\r\nthe two neighbouring countries. It is a huge burden on a\r\npoor least developed country.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our faith in the United\r\nNations, since it is the one universal institution where we\r\n66\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nall belong, big or small, wealthy or poor. The United\r\nNations is us — its Members. It does not exist apart from\r\nus. We can make it strong, or weaken it by our actions of\r\ncommission or omission.\r\nIt is my delegation’s view that a fitting gift to the\r\nOrganization on this occasion is for all its Members to live\r\nby the tenets of the Charter.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of the United Republic of Tanzania for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Daudi Ngelautwa Mwakawago,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Robert Millette,\r\nChairman of the Delegation of Grenada\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Robert Millette, Chairman of the Delegation of\r\nGrenada.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Robert Millette, Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of Grenada, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Millette: As we celebrate the golden years of the\r\nUnited Nations the words of the Chinese philosopher Lao-\r\ntzu come to mind: “A journey of a thousand miles begins\r\nwith a single step”.\r\nSeveral important meetings, conferences and debates\r\npreceded the official launching of the United Nations on 24\r\nOctober 1945 in San Francisco.\r\nThe meeting that took place somewhere in the Atlantic\r\nOcean between President Roosevelt of the United States of\r\nAmerica and Prime Minister Churchill of the United\r\nKingdom, on 14 August 1941, resulted in a declaration of\r\nprinciples known as the Atlantic Charter. This Charter\r\nexpressed the hope:\r\n“to see established a peace which will afford to all\r\nnations the means of dwelling in safety within their\r\nown boundaries, and which will afford assurance that\r\nall the men in all the lands may live out their lives in\r\nfreedom from fear and want”.\r\nThe impact of human destruction was significant and\r\ndemanded a reassurance among nations to find alternative\r\napproaches to conflict resolution and peacemaking, and a\r\nfirm commitment to maintain world peace and security.\r\nOn 30 October 1943 in Moscow, the foreign\r\nministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, the\r\nSoviet Union and China proclaimed that their\r\nGovernments recognized the need to establish a general\r\ninternational organization based on the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to\r\nmembership by all such States, large and small, for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nSome refer to the United Nations as the biggest\r\ndebating society in the world, in which perception takes\r\nprecedence over substance, rhetoric over reality — a\r\nTower of Babel where debates consist of grotesque rituals\r\nand recurrent irrelevancies.\r\nThe truth of the matter is that the United Nations, as\r\na relatively young institution, is the quintessential\r\nexample of humanity’s struggle for peace among nations\r\nand within nations. It bears the marks of humanity’s\r\ntriumphs and failures. However, in the pursuit of peace,\r\nthe United Nations continues, to paraphrase Isaiah, “to\r\nrun and not be weary, to walk and not grow faint”. From\r\nthe first meeting of the General Assembly in London on\r\n10 January 1946, with a membership then of 51 nations,\r\nto today’s commemorative celebration at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters with a membership of 185 nations, the\r\nUnited Nations continues to proclaim loud and clear its\r\nmission of peace initiatives in world health, human rights,\r\neducation and the environment.\r\nSince the end of the cold war several democracies\r\nhave emerged, resulting in a more democratic world.\r\nSurely, we have to support those democracies, assist those\r\ncountries that are in the process of building democratic\r\nstructures, and encourage those that are yet to embrace\r\nthe democratic principles.\r\nWhile we applaud the gains of the last 50 years, we\r\nseek to find solutions to such problems as drug\r\ntrafficking, regional and ethnic conflicts, debt burdens,\r\nbarriers to trade, international terrorism, and\r\nenvironmental threats. What does this mean for small\r\nStates like Grenada? What are the implications of these\r\nchallenges to the survival and security of small States?\r\nWe must not be discouraged. Rather, we must assist\r\nthe United Nations as it responds to the new economic\r\nand political realities of world peace and international\r\ndevelopment.\r\n67\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nAs we seek to restructure and position the United\r\nNations for the twenty-first century, we must use new\r\ntechnology to support the social and economic development\r\nof large and small States. Small States look to the United\r\nNations for assistance in information technology and human\r\nresource development. This assistance will result in social\r\nand economic progress and thereby enable us — the small\r\nStates — to attract capital and investment.\r\nThe Security Council should reflect the new economic\r\nand political realities. Greater emphasis should be placed on\r\nimproving the effectiveness of the work of the United\r\nNations in peace-keeping and peacemaking and, all the\r\nmore so, on efforts towards regional peace-keeping.\r\nWe see the United Nations as a forum for coordinating\r\nissues relating to world peace. To that end, we would wish\r\nto see the United Nations agencies work in close\r\ncollaboration with the Bretton Woods institutions and with\r\nother intergovernmental agencies to implement social and\r\neconomic development programmes.\r\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations is a time for reflection on the principles of\r\nits Charter. We must ask ourselves whether we have\r\nadhered to the principles of the Charter, whether we have\r\ntruly embraced the principle of universality.\r\nMr. President, Grenada concurs with your position on\r\nthe principle of universality as stated in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. In that light, we bring once again to the\r\nattention of the international community the exclusion of\r\nthe Republic of China from this world Organization since\r\n1971. We deem this a great loss to the United Nations and\r\nurge the opening of dialogue as a first step in finding a\r\nsolution to this problem.\r\nWe remain confident that a new United Nations will\r\nwork assiduously to achieve the goals set out and\r\naccomplish the tasks before it. We, the Member States, are\r\ncommitted to the United Nations as it continues in its\r\nefforts to ensure peace and security for the world in which\r\nwe live.\r\nOn behalf of the Prime Minister of my country,\r\nGrenada, and on behalf of my people, I thank you.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of Grenada for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Robert Millette, Chairman of the\r\nDelegation of Grenada, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAdoption of the draft resolution (A/50/48,\r\npara. 2)\r\nReport of the Preparatory Committee for\r\nthe Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations (A/50/48)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/48, para. 2)\r\nThe President: Before I call on the next speaker,\r\nwe shall first proceed to consider the draft resolution\r\nwhich appears in paragraph 2 of the report of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations and which contains the Declaration on the\r\nOccasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations (document A/50/48).\r\nI should like to inform Members that after action is\r\ntaken on the Declaration we shall hear the 11 remaining\r\nspeakers for the Special Commemorative Meeting. The\r\nSecretary-General and I will make closing statements\r\nthereafter.\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Richard Butler,\r\nPermanent Representative of Australia to the United\r\nNations and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for\r\nthe Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, to\r\nintroduce the report of the Preparatory Committee.\r\nMr. Butler (Australia), Chairman of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations: It is an honour for me, Sir, to serve under your\r\npresidency.\r\nI now report to the General Assembly as Chairman\r\nof the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. As one of the inventors of the\r\nfive-minute rule, I will be brief: I will make only five\r\npoints.\r\nFirst, in all of our work we have been assisted by an\r\nutterly superb Secretariat of the United Nation,s and I\r\nwant this to be heard in particular outside this Hall. I am\r\nthinking especially of Mrs. Sorensen and her fiftieth\r\nanniversary Secretariat team. Secondly, this international\r\ncommunity has agreed on the text of a Declaration for the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. It is the text in\r\ndocument A/50/48. Thirdly, we have discharged our\r\n68\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nresponsibility. We have produced a Declaration which\r\nreaffirms the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and our commitments to them. We have\r\nproduced a Declaration, a text on the future, which will\r\nhave meaning for the peoples of this world. Fourthly, this\r\nis a document that will serve us well, in particular through\r\nits guidelines for future cooperation amongst all nations.\r\nAnd, fifthly, in itself this Declaration represents a major act\r\nof cooperation. I will always be grateful for having been\r\nable to be a part of its creation. I thank all of you deeply\r\nfor your hard work and for your friendship.\r\nI commend to the Assembly this Declaration on the\r\nOccasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of members that the\r\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations contained in the draft resolution that\r\nappears in paragraph 2 of the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations be adopted by the General Assembly at its Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting by acclamation?\r\nThat being the case, I invite representatives to stand\r\nfor the adoption of the Declaration by acclamation.\r\nThe Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations was adopted by\r\nacclamation.\r\nContinuation of statements\r\nThe President: We shall now hear the remaining\r\nspeakers.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nikenike Vurobaravu, Deputy\r\nSecretary-General of the South Pacific Forum\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I call on Mr. Nikenike Vurobaravu,\r\nDeputy Secretary-General of the South Pacific Forum.\r\nMr. Nikenike Vurobaravu, Deputy Secretary-General\r\nof the South Pacific Forum, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Vurobaravu: It is a great honour and privilege\r\nto speak on behalf of the South Pacific Forum at this\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting in honour of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. The Forum is new to\r\nthe United Nations process, having been admitted as\r\nObserver only last year. But like many of the previous\r\ndistinguished speakers, we are deeply committed to the\r\nideals and principles enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nPrevious speakers have described more eloquently\r\nthe record and achievements of the United Nations since\r\nits inception 50 years ago. The vision on which the\r\nUnited Nations was built — peace, human dignity, justice,\r\neconomic and social progress — will be as valid in the\r\nnext 50 years as it was in the last 50. And, in an\r\nincreasingly complex and interdependent world, the role\r\nof the United Nations in pursuing that vision is of more\r\nand more importance to small countries, such as those of\r\nthe South Pacific Forum. The existence and programmes\r\nof the United Nations help guarantee our peace and\r\nsecurity, and promote our economic and social\r\ndevelopment in ways we are too small to manage entirely\r\nfor ourselves.\r\nWe applaud, therefore, the expanded and invigorated\r\nrole that the United Nations is playing in the post-cold-\r\nwar world. While our own South Pacific region is,\r\nthankfully, free from the sort of local conflict still far too\r\nprevalent in other parts of the world, we fully support the\r\ndevelopment of the peace-keeping and peacebuilding role\r\nof the United Nations. The Forum particularly welcomes\r\nthe progress towards real nuclear disarmament that has\r\nbeen possible in the new international environment. The\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons a few months ago was a major step\r\nforward. Even more important is the prospect of\r\nconclusion next year of a comprehensive test-ban treaty,\r\nwhich would ban all nuclear tests in all environments for\r\nall time. It is vital, if the world is to achieve the\r\nobjectives of peace and security embodied in the United\r\nNations Charter, that this opportunity to conclude a\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty be seized.\r\nIn this context, however, I must echo the Forum’s\r\ndeep disappointment and concern at the resumption this\r\nyear of nuclear testing in the Pacific. This testing poses\r\na serious threat to the welcome positive developments of\r\nnuclear disarmament to which I have referred, to our\r\nPacific environment, to the health of Pacific peoples and\r\nto the ideals of the United Nations to which we are all\r\nhere this week to lend our fullest support. Therefore, the\r\nForum welcomes the recent announcement by the United\r\nStates, Britain and France that they intend to support the\r\n69\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and we look\r\nforward to their early signing of its Protocols.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations also recognizes that\r\nto attain the primary objective of maintaining peace and\r\nsecurity the deep-seated economic and social causes of\r\ninternational instability must be addressed. The economic\r\ndevelopment of its small island members is of the highest\r\npriority for the Forum. Increasingly, this calls for attention\r\nto the environmental sustainability of the development\r\nprocess, as pressure grows — not least from problems like\r\nclimate change, which require a concerted international\r\napproach — on our small, fragile marine and terrestrial\r\necosystems.\r\nA major factor in the Forum’s decision to seek\r\nobserver status at the General Assembly was the growing\r\nrole of the United Nations in addressing sustainable-\r\ndevelopment issues. Forum countries have participated\r\nactively in the United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development at Rio de Janeiro and its follow-up, in the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, in the\r\nnegotiations on climate change and so on. These are areas\r\nwhere we look forward to a continuing increase in the role\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nOn this note, let me conclude by joining previous\r\nspeakers in congratulating the United Nations on its\r\nachievements and by stating that the countries of the South\r\nPacific Forum are united in their support for the United\r\nNations ideals and activities. We look forward to its next\r\n50 years.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Secretary-General\r\nof the South Pacific Forum for his statement.\r\nMr. Nikenike Vurobaravu, Deputy Secretary-General\r\nof the South Pacific Forum, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Edwin Carrington,\r\nSecretary-General of the Caribbean Community\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I call upon the next speaker, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Edwin Carrington, Secretary-General of the\r\nCaribbean Community.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Edwin Carrington, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Caribbean Community, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Carrington: It is my signal honour as\r\nSecretary-General of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) to be afforded the opportunity to address\r\nthis body on the historic occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. I should like to\r\nexpress my appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, and, through him, to the United\r\nNations, for this privilege.\r\nToday, 50 years following the signing of the Charter\r\ncreating the United Nations, the Organization still\r\nrepresents mankind’s greatest hope for peace,\r\ndevelopment and international cooperation. Indeed, as the\r\nUnited Nations celebrates this milestone anniversary, it\r\nhas much to be proud of, particularly in the promotion of\r\npeace and security, democracy and human rights,\r\neconomic and social development, the rights of women,\r\nthe rights of children and justice throughout the world.\r\nIn the field of economic and social development the\r\nUnited Nations has been the source of much of the vision\r\nand inspiration for the formation of the institutional\r\narrangements and mechanisms which have facilitated the\r\ndevelopment of the emerging nations of the post-war era.\r\nThe Caribbean Community is a grouping of such nations.\r\nAlthough it represents a mere 13 of the United Nations\r\n185 Members and an even smaller proportion of its\r\npeoples, CARICOM has been an active contributor to the\r\nfulfilment of the ideals of the Organization. Strategically\r\nlocated between North and South America and historically\r\nlinked to Europe, Africa and Asia, CARICOM is a virtual\r\nmicrocosm of our global community. Its fundamental\r\nobjective of enhancing the economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment of its peoples through regional cooperation,\r\nconsultation and coordination in an environment of\r\ndemocratic practice and respect for human rights makes\r\nCARICOM’s mission an integral part of the overall\r\npurpose of the United Nations.\r\nOf particular significance to the States members of\r\nthe Caribbean Community has been the contribution of\r\nthe United Nations to recognizing the equal sovereign\r\nstatus of nations while promoting the special needs of the\r\nleast developed and small nation States. The unanimous\r\nselection, for example, of one of our nationals to preside\r\nfor the first time over a session of the General Assembly,\r\nits forty-eighth, and the convening in one of our member\r\nStates of the highly significant United Nations Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States were recent and invaluable\r\ndemonstrations of this recognition, which also afforded\r\n70\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nCARICOM the welcome opportunity to be of further\r\nservice to the international community.\r\nAs the United Nations prepares for the future on the\r\nvery eve of a new century, and, indeed, a new millennium,\r\nit is challenged to play an even more decisive role in our\r\nrapidly changing political, economic and cultural landscape.\r\nTo do so, the United Nations will without doubt need to be\r\nreformed to provide, particularly, for more equitable\r\nrepresentation and decision-making. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals in “An Agenda for Peace” and “An\r\nAgenda for Development” offer an encouraging platform\r\nfrom which the United Nations can seek to launch its\r\nefforts to meet the challenges of the future and fulfil the\r\nhighest aspirations of its membership.\r\nWe in the Caribbean Community stand ready to play\r\nour part, particularly through intensified cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations, sensitive as we are to the importance of\r\nits contribution to the improvement of the human condition\r\nin our Community, a condition threatened by poverty,\r\nunemployment, degradation of the environment, narco-\r\ntrafficking and the vagaries of nature.\r\nCARICOM has long been firmly of the view that the\r\nresponse to these challenges lies in great measure in\r\nregional and international cooperation. For this reason, our\r\nmember States have, over the past 22 years, sought through\r\nthese means to advance and improve the standard of life of\r\nthe peoples of our small, vulnerable economies and\r\nsocieties. The experience gained, although at times\r\ndaunting, has nevertheless strengthened our conviction and\r\nresolve to intensify our efforts at such cooperation.\r\nIt is this conviction that led us recently to enlarge the\r\nhitherto English-speaking Caribbean Community to include\r\nSuriname, a Dutch-speaking country. It is this conviction\r\nthat led us to broaden our horizons for regional cooperation\r\nthrough the recent establishment of the Association of\r\nCaribbean States, membership of which is open to all the\r\nStates, countries and Territories of the Caribbean basin.\r\nIt is this same conviction that has led us to seek and\r\nobtain from the United Nations a commitment for closer\r\ncooperation, a recent demonstration of which was the\r\nadoption in October 1991 of General Assembly resolution\r\n46/8, granting observer status to the Caribbean Community,\r\nand it is this same conviction of the value and efficacy of\r\nregional and international cooperation that reenforces the\r\nfaith of the Caribbean Community, particularly as a\r\ngrouping of small nation States, in the United Nations and\r\nits future.\r\nWe in CARICOM are therefore proud to add our\r\nvoice to that of the international community in extending\r\ncongratulations to the United Nations on the occasion of\r\nits fiftieth anniversary and, in so doing, to pledge our\r\ncontinuing strong support for the ideals and aspirations of\r\nthe United Nations in the years ahead.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nCaribbean Community for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Edwin Carrington, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Caribbean Community, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim,\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of African\r\nUnity\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I call on the next speaker,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization of African Unity.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization of African Unity, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Salim: Fifty years ago the world emerged from\r\nthe ashes of a devastating war to found the United\r\nNations. It was a world rediscovering its common\r\nhumanity and destiny after the division, hatred and\r\ndestruction of the war. In the new Organization, the world\r\nsaw an opportunity to recreate society, rebuild the bonds\r\nof human solidarity, work together, promote\r\nunderstanding and cooperation, correct the wrongs of the\r\npast and create a new world order, founded on freedom\r\nand justice, in which humanity was at peace with itself\r\nand forswore war.\r\nDespite the determination and efforts of the United\r\nNations in the last 50 years, the world has not been\r\nwithout conflict and war, or without injustice, oppression\r\nand the doubt which they have at times engendered. As\r\nthe world has gone through its cyclical changes, the\r\nUnited Nations has seen violence, human suffering,\r\ninjustice, poverty, racism and wars. In the attempts to\r\nrespond to its global mission of peace and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, the United Nations has applied itself\r\nseriously and made a difference to many. In its\r\ninvolvement in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, in fostering socio-economic development and in\r\n71\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\npromoting human rights, the Organization has made its\r\nmark on our global society.\r\nThe work of its specialized agencies and programmes\r\nhas brought development and humanitarian assistance to the\r\nmore needy of this world. Yes, the United Nations has had\r\nits share of difficulties and shortcomings. Yet,\r\nnotwithstanding these shortcomings and, not least, those\r\ndifficulties thrust upon it by the limitations and actions of\r\nits Member States, it is still an Organization which in its\r\nuniversal character embodies the world’s peoples, who are\r\nyearning to embrace each other in a partnership of\r\nunderstanding and cooperation. Thanks to the United\r\nNations, we have witnessed more than human deprivation,\r\nsuffering and wars; we have also witnessed human\r\ngenerosity, compassion, courage, gallantry and sacrifice.\r\nFifty years ago a free Africa, liberated from\r\ncolonialism and racial bigotry, was only a concept to many\r\nand a distant dream even to the optimistic internationalists\r\namong those who met in San Francisco to draw up the\r\nCharter of our United Nations. To the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and Africa as a whole, therefore, the United\r\nNations has been an instrument of liberation. Today Africa\r\nis free and apartheid has been relegated to history, thanks,\r\nto a great extent, to the joint struggle coming from within\r\nthe United Nations. In the United Nations, the world’s\r\nopposition to colonialism and racism found convergence\r\nand a concrete expression of global partnership for change.\r\nThat partnership made the difference, and the liberation of\r\nAfrica is a reality we now live.\r\nAs Africa now faces the future, one in which the\r\nchallenge of human development is growing ever more\r\nurgent, we shall continue to need the solidarity and support\r\nof the United Nations. To sustain that spirit of global\r\nhuman solidarity inherent in the United Nations system, we\r\nmust renew our confidence in this Organization, overcome\r\nour doubts and defeat some Member States’ sentiments of\r\nisolation, which now seem to be slowly undermining the\r\nspirit of internationalism embodied in the United Nations.\r\nEqually, as we face the future, Africa being mainly a\r\ncontinent of small and developing countries, we see the\r\ncontinent as one with the United Nations in the global\r\nsearch for equality and peace and in promoting human\r\ndevelopment. In this world which has more often than not\r\ntended to gravitate towards the unilateralism of the\r\npowerful, Africa can only continue to find security in the\r\ncollective of the United Nations.\r\nThe new changes which have taken place in the\r\nworld system are presenting new challenges. The United\r\nNations is being tested, and it has to adjust. But for it to\r\ndo so effectively, its Member States must renew their\r\nfaith in our shared humanity. To strengthen the United\r\nNations, bridges of cooperation and understanding must\r\nspan the full breadth of this globe. We must rekindle the\r\nspirit of the founding fathers.\r\nThis is a celebration of global solidarity and\r\ncooperation. It is a commemoration of half a century of\r\npartnership between the peoples of the world. We\r\ntherefore need to take stock of the past 50 years, assess\r\nour achievements, weigh our failures and reflect so that\r\nwe can forge ahead. This is also an opportunity to\r\nrededicate ourselves to the ideals of the United Nations,\r\nto renew our faith in the Organization and to pledge to it\r\nour undivided political and resource support so that it can\r\neffectively face the daunting challenges of peace and\r\nhuman development as we enter the next millennium.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization of African Unity, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Wilhelm Höynck,\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I call on the next speaker,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wilhelm Höynck, Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wilhelm Höynck, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Höynck: The Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) gladly accepted the\r\ninvitation to take part in these celebrations, and it is a\r\ngreat honour for me to speak on behalf of the OSCE.\r\nFive decades is a long life for an international\r\norganization. The very fact that we can celebrate this\r\nanniversary today is evidence of the strength of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n72\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nLooking into the future, we need the United Nations\r\neven more than in the past. In spite of setbacks,\r\ndisappointments and shortcomings, there are encouraging\r\nand even inspiring signs indicating further progress towards\r\nworldwide cooperative and comprehensive security.\r\nSuch progress cannot be achieved without the United\r\nNations. We need a United Nations which can fulfil the\r\ntasks assigned to it in the Charter — as we understand the\r\nCharter today — on the basis of 50 years’ experience.\r\nThe problem-solving potential of the United Nations\r\ndepends almost entirely on the support it receives from its\r\nMember States. It is the contributions of Member States\r\nwhich make the United Nations credible, strong and\r\neffective.\r\nWe live in one world, rendered ever more closely\r\nconnected by our indivisible destinies. The Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and other organizations\r\nin its region are willing to make their contribution to a\r\nlasting and peaceful order from Vancouver to Vladivostok.\r\nAs regional organizations become able to assume the tasks\r\nassigned to them in the Charter, the United Nations will\r\nbecome stronger. Regional action will alleviate the burden\r\nthat has proved to be too heavy for the United Nations.\r\nThis will\r\n“contribute to a deeper sense of participation,\r\nconsensus and democratization in international\r\naffairs.” (A/47/277, para. 64)\r\nOn this we all agree, but we still have to find better\r\nways of achieving mutually reinforcing cooperation. We\r\nmust improve our ability to allocate tasks according to\r\ncomparative advantages.\r\nThe situation in the world today requires an ever more\r\nclosely interlocking network of international organizations\r\nin which the United Nations must have a special place.\r\nOnly with such a network will we be able to cope with the\r\nchallenges confronting us. We should give further thought\r\nto how we can integrate non-governmental organizations\r\nmore effectively into such a network. Through non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, responsible citizens, in\r\nparticular young people, participate in the difficult task of\r\npeace-building. Let us engage their specific operational\r\ncapabilities and their dedication.\r\nEfforts to strengthen the management and to\r\nstreamline the structures of the United Nations are just one\r\naspect of the tasks confronting the community of nations.\r\nThese efforts will succeed only if they are rooted in our\r\nfaith in fundamental human rights and freedoms and in\r\nthe dignity of the human being. These common values\r\nwere the beacon of hope that the founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations wanted to establish in the aftermath of\r\ncrimes against humanity and a devastating war. As we\r\nknow today, the light of this beacon, despite all the\r\nefforts that have been made, has not been strong enough\r\nto illuminate expanding areas of darkness.\r\nThis is not the fault of those who have served the\r\nUnited Nations in the 50 years of its existence. It has had\r\ndedicated men and women who served it. Some of them\r\ngave their lives. Dag Hammarskjöld was one of them. He\r\nlived, worked and died as a servant of peace. If that\r\noutstanding Secretary-General could speak to us today, he\r\nmight repeat what he said 35 years ago:\r\n“Working at the edge of the development of human\r\nsociety is to work on the brink of the unknown.\r\nMuch of what is done will one day prove to have\r\nbeen of little avail. That is no excuse for the failure\r\nto act in accordance with our best understanding, in\r\nrecognition of its limits but with faith in the ultimate\r\nresult of the creative evolution in which it is our\r\nprivilege to cooperate”.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for\r\nhis statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wilhelm Höynck, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Carlos Moneta,\r\nPermanent Secretary of the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I now call on the next\r\nspeaker, His Excellency Mr. Carlos Moneta, Permanent\r\nSecretary of the Latin American Economic System.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Moneta, Permanent\r\nSecretary of the Latin American Economic System,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Moneta (interpretation from Spanish): It is an\r\nhonour for the Latin American Economic System (SELA)\r\n73\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nto participate through the Permanent Secretary in this\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly.\r\nClearly, the balance sheet for these 50 years of United\r\nNations activities is positive in connection with the\r\nobjective of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. But there still exist serious areas of tension and\r\nconflict which require more resolute action by the system.\r\nMoreover, there must be greater democratization in the\r\ndecision-making process within the Security Council.\r\nUnfortunately, we do not find the same favourable\r\nbalance sheet in the field of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The effectiveness of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has constantly diminished. While an important\r\ncontribution in sectoral areas has been made by the\r\nspecialized agencies, the United Nations as such has still\r\nnot succeeded in gaining enough support to agree on\r\neffective policies binding the entire international community\r\nto a serious effort of development. Rather, we are seeing\r\nthe erosion of international cooperation and a dwindling of\r\nUnited Nations presence in debates and decisions on\r\ninternational economic relations and the promotion of\r\nsustainable development with social equity.\r\nThis process of exclusion is exacerbated by policies\r\naimed at keeping the United Nations apart from economic\r\nthemes. Latin America and the Caribbean, as indicated by\r\nSELA’s Latin American Council at its last meeting, does\r\nnot share this view because it would be a serious limitation\r\nof the objectives for which the organization was\r\nestablished. In addition, it would remove the indispensable\r\nunderpinnings of action in the field of international peace\r\nand security. Peace and development are one and any\r\nintention to separate them would lead the world to even\r\nmore serious conflict.\r\nMoreover, the growing globalization of the world\r\neconomy and the parallel process of regionalism require\r\nthat developing countries make an ever greater effort to\r\neffectively join the global market. As was reflected in the\r\nrecent World Summit for Social Development, our countries\r\nmust respond to a two-fold challenge to grow and\r\nmodernize it and, at the same time, resolve the serious and\r\npotentially explosive social debt characterized by the\r\nconsiderable expansion of poverty and marginalization.\r\nIn this context, Latin America and the Caribbean have\r\nbeen making major efforts to achieve productive change\r\nwith equity. Similarly, Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nfirmly intend to reaffirm their identity and diversity in the\r\nemerging new international order. And for this we are\r\ndeveloping our regional processes of consultation,\r\ncooperation and open integration. Globalization and\r\nregionalism do not, in any way, mean accepting without\r\nany discussion one homogenizing model, but, rather,\r\nexploring valid alternatives where, with our own cultural\r\nidentity, we can incorporate the valuable experience of\r\nour members with those of other parts of the world. The\r\nUnited Nations is the best place for an exchange of views\r\nleading to a new world order respectful of diversity in the\r\nframework of the so-called global village.\r\nWe look forward to the negotiations on the\r\nestablishment in the framework of the United Nations, of\r\nan agenda for development. We believe that, together\r\nwith the adoption of effective measures for international\r\ncooperation, to put into practice the commitments adopted\r\nat the World Summit for Social Development, “An\r\nAgenda for Development” represents an exceptional\r\nopportunity for the United Nations again to play its\r\ncentral role in articulating a global vision of international\r\neconomic relations and world development. This vision,\r\nof course, should include, as a matter of priority, the\r\nviews of the developing countries. It should also lead to\r\nagreement on policy guidelines and concrete commitments\r\nin the field of international cooperation, the responsibility\r\nfor which today resides mainly with the international\r\nfinancial and monetary institutions.\r\nI would like to express SELA’s great appreciation\r\nSELA for its cooperation with the United Nations and\r\nspecialized agencies. Special mention should be made of\r\nthe support of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) for the activities of the Permanent\r\nSecretary of SELA to benefit the 27 States members of\r\nthe System, both through the regional programme and the\r\nUNDP Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among\r\nDeveloping Countries.\r\nA contemporary French philosopher said that some\r\nmen turn action into ideas, while others turn ideas into\r\naction. Let us pool our efforts so that, through the United\r\nNations, we may be enabled — in accordance with the\r\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary\r\nof the United Nations that has just been adopted — to\r\ncarry out this task together.\r\nThe President: I thank the Permanent Secretary of\r\nthe Latin American Economic System for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Moneta, Permanent\r\nSecretary of the Latin American Economic System,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\n74\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. César Gaviria,\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of American\r\nStates\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I call on His Excellency Mr. César\r\nGaviria, Secretary-General of the Organization of American\r\nStates.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. César Gaviria, Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization of American States, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nMr. Gaviria (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations has mobilized the entire world. Leaders from every\r\ncorner of the Earth have come to this forum to pay tribute\r\nto five decades of achievement benefiting peace,\r\ndevelopment and well-being. The American hemisphere\r\ncould not be absent from this tribute, which is why, as\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of American States\r\n(OAS), I wish to express to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and,\r\nthrough him, to the United Nations the support of the\r\npeople of the Americas.\r\nOur continent, which is today united by the values of\r\ndemocracy and freedom, regards the United Nations as the\r\nmost appropriate and effective instrument to further the\r\ncollective aspirations of mankind. During these three days\r\nmany have mentioned the successes of the past. We should\r\nlike to join in this recognition of half a century of activity\r\nand success. Seeing it in perspective, we are impressed by\r\nhow much has been achieved, but it has not been an easy\r\nroad for the United Nations. Keeping alive the ideal of a\r\ncommon destiny in a world divided by apparently\r\nirreconcilable hatred is perhaps the Organization’s main\r\ncontribution.\r\nDespite being frequently on the brink of the precipice,\r\nmankind, thanks to the United Nations, has retained its faith\r\nin certain shared ideals. These walls, even at the darkest\r\nmoments, have nurtured the dream of a world united and at\r\npeace.\r\nMany have also mentioned that this is a good time to\r\npause and look to the future. It is necessary to do so, not\r\nonly because this commemoration is an appropriate\r\noccasion, but also because there has never been a more\r\nauspicious time for the promotion of collective action and\r\nmultilateralism. The main challenges that affect the world\r\ncommunity today cannot be overcome unless we pool the\r\ndetermination of all nations. Poverty and hunger,\r\nenvironmental degradation, international organized crime,\r\narms trafficking, the violation of human rights, terrorism,\r\nthe arms build-up and nuclear proliferation are examples\r\nof the challenges that transcend frontiers.\r\nIn a world without the threat of the cold war, the\r\npreservation of peace and collective security are no longer\r\nthe responsibility of a few but have become an obligation\r\nof all. Only with States’ vigorous participation in and\r\ncommitment to the United Nations and the other regional\r\nand global multilateral institutions will it be possible to\r\nfind the solutions that the global agenda requires. Those\r\nwho today support a policy isolationism and non-\r\ninvolvement in world affairs, because of a myopic\r\nconception of national interests, are sowing uncertainty as\r\nto world stability and peace. Clinging to a mistaken sense\r\nof fiscal frugality, some would like to save a few cents at\r\nthe cost of sacrificing the viability of a new international\r\norder.\r\nIn saying this, I do not mean that it is not essential\r\nto undertake a profound review and reform of the United\r\nNations and all the other international organizations in\r\norder to root out inefficiency, cut away whatever is\r\nsuperfluous and bring their activities into line with the\r\npriorities of the Member countries. In the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, as in the United Nations, we are already\r\ndoing this. But we cannot allow those who, frequently\r\nalone, have shouldered the ideal of a world at peace to\r\nfade away from lack of support precisely when the dream\r\nis finally within reach.\r\nThere are those who selfishly seek to argue that, in\r\na world where strategic confrontation has ceased to exist,\r\nthe powerful can allow themselves the luxury of\r\nforgetting the deaths elsewhere. Since there is no enemy,\r\nthey say, there is no longer any threat. How mistaken\r\nthey are. The threat is no longer communism but, rather,\r\nthe spectre of the wars of the past, in which ancestral\r\nhatred, territorial ambition and atavistic fear could unleash\r\nboundless catastrophe. The threat is no longer capitalism\r\nbut, rather, an unresolved agenda of urgent global\r\nproblems.\r\nFor this reason we owe congratulations to Presidents\r\nClinton and Yeltsin, who, inspired by the spirit of the\r\nUnited Nations and this celebration, have risen above\r\nwhat is described in their countries as parochialism or\r\nnationalism for the sake of the huge potential in well-\r\nbeing and peace that multilateral cooperation can achieve.\r\n75\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nI should like to conclude by making an appeal. Let us\r\nensure that when the euphoria of this celebration dissipates,\r\nthe constructive spirit that can be felt in the international\r\nclimate today will remain, so that the United Nations\r\nbecomes the setting where the hope for a better world is\r\ntranslated into reality. Let us see to it that in 50 years’\r\ntime, when our words are just a distant historical record,\r\nthis anniversary will be remembered as the beginning of a\r\nnew era.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of American States for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. César Gaviria, Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization of American States, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Tang Chengyuan,\r\nSecretary-General of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I call on the next speaker, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Tang Chengyuan, Secretary-General of the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Committee.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tang Chengyuan, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Tang Chengyuan: On behalf of the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee, I have the honour\r\nand privilege to offer felicitations to you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the high office of the presidency of this\r\nAssembly and to express our profound gratitude for the\r\nmanner in which you have presided at this Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting.\r\nIt is a matter of honour and pride for me, on behalf of\r\nthe Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee, to address\r\nthe distinguished and eminent persons gathered here to\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nI should like to join those speakers who have already\r\ncongratulated the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, and yourself, Sir, on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is not\r\nsynonymous with the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the\r\nSecond World War. Indeed it is more.\r\nTo look back on and address the question of 50\r\nyears of the United Nations is to consider the process of\r\nthe institutionalization of international cooperation in our\r\nsystem, in which the geographical, physical, biological\r\nand economic processes are interrelated. The work of the\r\nUnited Nations to date has not only shown us that\r\ninstitutionalized cooperation is possible and workable, but\r\nhas also amply demonstrated that, in the interdependent\r\nbut fragile environment of contemporary international\r\nsociety, cooperation is more than ever necessary as a\r\nmultitude of demographic, economic, environmental,\r\npolitical, technological and criminal factors overwhelm\r\nState decision-makers.\r\nAn overview of the institutional cooperation forged\r\nby this universal institution reveals far greater areas of\r\nprogress and effective, cooperative action through the\r\nwork of the Organization than the popular impression\r\nwould appear to indicate. Over the years, the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations,\r\n“determined to practice tolerance and live together\r\nin peace with one another as good neighbours”,\r\nhave, inter alia, reaffirmed their faith in fundamental\r\nhuman rights. They have acknowledged that climate is the\r\ncommon concern of mankind, declared the seabed and\r\nocean floor beyond the national jurisdiction of States to\r\nbe the common heritage of mankind, and resolved to use\r\nouter space for the common benefit of mankind.\r\nThe spectacular results attained in the speeding of\r\nTrust Territories and non-self-governing Territories to full\r\nnationhood, and the current near-universal membership of\r\nthe Organization, represent another achievement of this\r\ninstitution. These are among the salient factors that, inter\r\nalia, underscore the institution’s commitment to the cause\r\nof maintaining international peace and security. The\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations in his “An Agenda\r\nfor Peace” reinforce the principles of the non-use of force\r\nin international relations and the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes. The end of the cold war and the dissipation of\r\nthe East-West conflict that it characterized have ushered\r\nin a new era of peace and development.\r\nThe achievements and successful undertakings of the\r\nUnited Nations and its organs stem in part from according\r\ndue respect to the obligations arising from international\r\nlaw. The Organization has taken appropriate steps to\r\nensure the observance of the rule of law in international\r\nrelations and the progressive development of international\r\nlaw and its codification through resolutions, declarations\r\n76\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nand codification conferences. Consensus-building in the\r\ncodification of international law is by nature a time-\r\nconsuming and complex process, but the spirit of\r\ncooperation kindled by the Organization has kept the\r\ninternational legislative draughtsman and lawyers totally\r\npreoccupied, in particular during the ongoing United\r\nNations Decade of International Law.\r\nOver the years, the AALCC has made its modest\r\ncontribution to the attainment of the objectives and\r\nprinciples relevant to its sphere of competence. I should\r\nlike, on behalf of the AALCC, to extend to the General\r\nAssembly my assurances that the Committee will continue\r\nto work to support the activities of the United Nations and\r\nto cooperate towards the prevalence of the rule of law in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Committee for his\r\nstatement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tang Chengyuan, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Shamshad Ahmad,\r\nSecretary-General of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nShamshad Ahmad, Secretary-General of the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Shamshad Ahmad, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Economic Cooperation Organization,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Ahmad: I deem it a great privilege and an\r\nhonour to be representing the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO) at this historic event. As almost\r\neveryone who has spoken over the past three days has said,\r\nthis is indeed a welcome opportunity for us not only to look\r\nback in retrospect on the 50 years of the United Nations,\r\nbut also to reflect on its future in the light of the new\r\ndynamics propelling today’s dramatically changed world.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, the international\r\ncommunity is faced with new realities that have altered the\r\nfundamentals of global relations, necessitating bold and\r\ninnovative approaches to the fulfilment of the ideals that\r\ninspired the establishment of the United Nations. In this\r\ntask, regional arrangements, political or economic, are\r\nassuming a crucial role as instruments of peace and\r\ndevelopment. The Economic Cooperation Organization is\r\none such major regional organization. It comprises 10\r\nmember States, all sharing common bonds of history and\r\na collective vision for a future of progress and prosperity.\r\nDevoted solely to the socio-economic well-being of its\r\nmember States, ECO is playing a pivotal role in the\r\nstability of a vast region in Asia’s heartland.\r\nAs the Executive Head of that organization, I avail\r\nmyself of this opportunity to renew, on behalf of the ECO\r\nmember States, their full commitment to and support of\r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter. ECO is an outward-looking organization\r\nready to work and cooperate with every country, region\r\nand international organization in pursuit of global peace,\r\nharmony and sustainable economic development. We\r\nsupport the efforts of the United Nations and its\r\nSecretary-General to remove the causes of conflict and\r\ndistress in all parts of the world.\r\nToday, the “iron curtain” is no longer there, but a\r\n“poverty curtain” still divides the international community\r\ninto two unequal worlds, one embarrassingly rich and the\r\nother desperately poor. We certainly need a just, fair and\r\nequitable economic order free of discriminatory and\r\nprotectionist walls. It is in this direction that the United\r\nNations should focus its attention in the coming years.\r\nThe international community must develop new\r\npatterns of collaboration on the basis of equality,\r\npartnership, interdependence and mutuality of benefit. Let\r\nus all work together and bring the United Nations into\r\nconformity with the role that it is required to play to lead\r\nus and succeeding generations into the new millennium\r\nwith peace and honour.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Shamsad Ahmad, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Economic Cooperation Organization,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Enrique Roman-\r\nMorey, Secretary-General of the Agency for the\r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/12 A, I call now on His\r\n77\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nExcellency Mr. Enrique Roman-Morey, Secretary-General\r\nof the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Enrique Roman-Morey, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Enrique Roman-Morey (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The signing of the Charter of the United Nations\r\n50 years ago in San Francisco was surely this century’s\r\nmost important event for mankind. It represented the\r\nongoing desire of international society to put an end to war.\r\nWe must recognize that the Charter of the United\r\nNations was not the first worldwide attempt to achieve\r\nlasting peace. It was, however, the most complete one of its\r\ntime. Susceptible, like all human activities of improvement,\r\nthe Organization was subsequently marked by conflict\r\nbetween the great Powers and the needs of the small ones.\r\nFor decades before and after San Francisco, theoreticians of\r\ninternational relations saw global policy in terms of\r\nconflict. The ideological frame of reference during that time\r\nenabled the strong to do whatever they liked and obliged\r\nthe weak to do whatever they could.\r\nIn February 1967, nearly 22 years after the signing of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, at the core of the cold war without being part of\r\nit, gave mankind the example of the Treaty of Tlatelolco\r\nfor the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which established\r\nthe intergovernmental organization that I have the honour\r\nto represent, the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin American and the Caribbean (OPANAL),\r\nand which created the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in the\r\nworld in keeping with the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Treaty of Tlatelolco is a unique, incomparable\r\nTreaty in many respects, but, above all, it is the oldest one\r\nof its kind because it pre-dates the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and goes beyond it in\r\nbanning nuclear weapons. In addition, it is the first\r\ndisarmament treaty which was signed and ratified by the\r\nfive acknowledged nuclear Powers, respecting the wishes of\r\nthe peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean and\r\nguaranteeing their status. It should also be emphasized that\r\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco recognizes that nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones are not an end in themselves, but rather a means to\r\nachieve the subsequent stage: general and complete\r\ndisarmament.\r\nAllow me to recall what then-Secretary-General U\r\nThant said:\r\n“It is easy to see the magnitude of the obstacles\r\nthat block progress in the field of disarmament and\r\narms control, which is so complicated and\r\nfrustrating. But these same difficulties enhance the\r\nmerit and the significance of what you have\r\nachieved. In a world that too often appears obscure\r\nand ominous, the Treaty of Tlatelolco will shine like\r\na beacon”.\r\nSecretary-General U Thant was not mistaken. This\r\nyear, in 1995, 28 years after being opened for signature,\r\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco has become universal, having\r\nbeen signed by all 33 States which are members of the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region — as the best\r\nfiftieth birthday gift for the United Nations.\r\nUnderstanding that there are only two ways of\r\nestablishing and putting into force a legal order in\r\ninternational relations, namely either through force or\r\nthrough consensus, our region chose the latter through\r\nnegotiation and conciliation of positions — which was not\r\nalways easy to do. Consensus is the harmonization of\r\ndesires, and in the political field the harmonization of\r\ndesires means balance among the parties, based on the\r\nlack of coercion, legal equality of States, free\r\ndetermination of peoples, non-intervention in internal\r\naffairs, respect for treaties freely agreed to, peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes and cooperation for the common\r\nbenefit. All of this means, in turn, the clear and definite\r\nrenunciation of the threat or use of force. All of these\r\nprinciples, while not always fully respected, have made\r\nthe United Nations great by making it necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of world peace and for the promotion of the\r\nsocial and economic development of peoples.\r\nThe need to faithfully respect all of these principles,\r\nall of which are embodied in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, in the Treaty of Tlatelolco and in most of the\r\nother international instruments that govern us, highlights\r\nthe primacy of multilateralism as an essential element in\r\nrelations among nations of the world. But let us recall\r\nthat this primacy can be achieved only through the firm\r\npolitical will of the States parties to reach agreement\r\nrelated to the firm commitment to respect what they have\r\ncommitted themselves to. In other words, there is a legal\r\ncommitment that binds parties to the letter of agreement,\r\nand a moral commitment that binds them to its spirit.\r\n78\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nFortunately, only rarely has the United Nations been\r\nharshly criticized; sometimes for having been ineffective in\r\ndealing with problems where ideological confrontations or\r\nclashes of interests were visible. Rarely, also, has there\r\nbeen praise for the immense benefits the international\r\ncommunity has enjoyed under the Organization’s\r\nmanagement, such as peace-keeping operations or the\r\ncountless funds allocated to Member States that need\r\ntechnical and economic assistance. This is why the current\r\nfinancial crisis being experienced by international\r\norganizations, and, of course, by other organizations such\r\nas OPANAL, is regrettable, incomprehensible and\r\nunacceptable. Let us remember that the commitment of\r\nparties is not only legal, but also moral, and that only the\r\nparties to international treaties themselves can determine\r\ntheir strength, their endurance and their successful\r\nmanagement. We believe that it is time to give serious\r\nthought to the latter aspect before the lack of cash erodes\r\nthe foundations of one of the greatest ideas produced by\r\nmankind.\r\nFor a world free of nuclear tests; for a world free of\r\nnuclear weapons: from this rostrum, as Secretary-General\r\nof OPANAL, I congratulate the United Nations. I pay\r\ntribute to the citizens of the world who enhance it. On\r\nbehalf of the regional organization I represent, I wish the\r\nUnited Nations every success in its invaluable endeavours.\r\nOnly the efforts of its Members can ensure this success.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General of the\r\nAgency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Enrique Roman-Morey, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Senator Humberto Celli\r\nGerbasi, President of the Latin American Parliament\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I call now on His Excellency Senator\r\nHumberto Celli Gerbasi, President of the Latin American\r\nParliament.\r\nHis Excellency Senator Humberto Celli Gerbasi,\r\nPresident of the Latin American Parliament, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Celli Gerbasi (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nare celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment\r\nof the United Nations, a body which has carried out\r\nimportant work benefitting the international community\r\nand its main component, the individual. When the United\r\nNations was formed in San Francisco, on 26 June 1945,\r\nthe world saw the challenges and objectives that the\r\nyoung Organization had to face — to protect the world\r\nfrom war and to foster peace and security; to promote\r\neconomic and social progress; and to define and protect\r\nthe rights and freedoms of every human being without\r\ndistinction as to race, language or religion.\r\nThe United Nations has made a great effort to attain\r\nits objectives. However, we have witnessed armed conflict\r\nin many parts of the world. These conflicts have not only\r\ntaken millions of lives, but they have also left very\r\nserious economic and social consequences.\r\nThe Latin American Parliament has established its\r\nposition on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\r\nirreparable damage they cause to people and to the\r\nenvironment, but we have just seen two countries —\r\nFrance and China — permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil of this Organization, detonate deadly devices,\r\ndisregarding the outcry of the people of the world against\r\nthem, disregarding people and their habitat as well as the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nThe problem of the external debt continues to\r\nstrangle the developing countries, requiring greater and\r\ngreater sacrifices on the part of their citizens. For 20\r\nyears the Latin American countries, and many developing\r\ncountries in Africa and Asia, have been making efforts to\r\nexport savings to cope with external debt servicing. This\r\nhas created problems such as the exacerbation of poverty\r\nand has led to the difficulties that these countries are\r\nfacing in the functioning and modernization of their\r\nproduction equipment and social infrastructure.\r\nThe amount of the overall external debt of the\r\ndeveloping countries as of 31 December 1994 was $1.6\r\ntrillion. It is therefore of the utmost importance for the\r\npeaceful development of international relations to define\r\nthe legal framework for regulating the general principles\r\nof conventional law, in terms of obligations, and those of\r\nmodern international law, and for this purpose the\r\ncompetent body is the International Court of Justice in\r\nThe Hague. This is a good opportunity to emphasize the\r\nimportance of having the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations request the International Court of Justice in The\r\nHague, in the exercise of its advisory competence, to\r\nspecify the necessary legal principles with respect to\r\n79\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nexternal debt, which are essential to the achievement of\r\njustice and to the preservation of peace among peoples.\r\nNew terms of understanding must be created, and a\r\ncode of conduct should be established. As a temporary,\r\nimmediate measure, it should be recommended — and this\r\nOrganization could cooperate in this respect — that interest\r\non the external debt be calculated in terms of its real value,\r\nwhich is 40 per cent lower on the secondary market.\r\nAnother very important element that affects the public\r\ninterests of our country is corruption. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to emphasize that the ninety-fourth conference of\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Bucharest, Romania,\r\nfrom 4 to 14 October this year, adopted by acclamation a\r\nresolution on parliamentary action to combat corruption and\r\non the need for international cooperation. This document\r\nsets forth the national and international steps that should be\r\ntaken to eliminate this worldwide scourge.\r\nAt the close of the twentieth century, the prospects for\r\nthe developing countries are not very encouraging. We feel\r\nthat there should be an ethical obligation to allow for the\r\neconomic growth and social development of all nations, one\r\nin which there are no exploiters and no exploited and in\r\nwhich freedom, peace, harmony and social justice prevail.\r\nWe wish to begin the twenty-first century with clear,\r\nopen and equitable prospects for all. We believe that in the\r\nnext millennium, our descendants will inherit a hospitable\r\nplanet, capable of perpetuating the human race in dignity\r\nand honour.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Latin\r\nAmerican Parliament for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Humberto Celli Gerbasi, President\r\nof the Latin American Parliament, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Julio Icaza Gallard,\r\nDirector of Functional Integration at the General\r\nSecretariat of the Central American Integration System\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/12 A, I now call on His Excellency Mr. Julio\r\nIcaza Gallard, Director of Functional Integration at the\r\nGeneral Secretariat of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Julio Icaza Gallard, Director of\r\nFunctional Integration at the General Secretariat of\r\nthe Central American Integration System, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Icaza Gallard (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe Central American Integration System (CAIS)\r\ncongratulates the United Nations on this historic occasion,\r\nwhich happens to coincide exactly with the granting to\r\nour organization of Observer status.\r\nOur organization of the six States of the Central\r\nAmerican isthmus has as one of its fundamental\r\nunderpinnings respect for the principles and norms of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS), which demonstrates that our\r\nsystemwide subregional nature binds us firmly with the\r\nregional system and with the global system represented by\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAccordingly, the new era that this commemoration\r\nis ushering in — this new era of peace, democracy and\r\ncooperation, to which the United Nations must adapt —\r\nis, for the Central American Integration System, a global\r\nexample that we, as a Central American organization,\r\nhave begun to follow, through the coordination of all of\r\nour regional integration organs and institutions in order\r\nthat we might become a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development.\r\nThe current recognition, in the United Nations, of\r\nthe fact that worldwide peace, security and stability can\r\nbe achieved only if the economic and social needs of\r\npeoples are met is shared by the Central American\r\nIntegration System, whose concept of development is\r\nintegrated in such a way as to tackle simultaneously, in a\r\nharmonious, balanced way, the economic, social, cultural,\r\npolitical and environmental spheres. Central America’s\r\nhistorical experience reveals the indissoluble relationship\r\nof all these sectoral aspects of development. It is therefore\r\nnecessary for their respective agendas to be viewed as the\r\nintegral and harmonious parts of a single whole.\r\nThat is why our new model of Central American\r\ndemocratic security, to which we are giving concrete\r\nexpression through the negotiation of a treaty on this very\r\nimportant matter, seeks precisely to protect and promote\r\nthis kind of central, integrated development, which\r\nfocuses on the human being, on the men and women who\r\nlive in Central America.\r\nWe also welcome the consensus that has emerged as\r\nthe result of the activities of the United Nations on the\r\nconcepts of sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\n80\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\ndevelopment. Central America has, for its part, defined its\r\nconcept of sustainable development as a process of gradual\r\nchange in the quality of life of human beings, centred on\r\nthe individual as the primary focus of development, through\r\neconomic growth with social equity and through the\r\ntransformation of production methods and consumption\r\npatterns, a process based on the ecological balance and\r\nnecessary support of the region. This process requires\r\nrespect for regional, national and local ethnic and cultural\r\ndiversity, as well as the strengthening of peaceful\r\ncoexistence through the full participation of citizens, in\r\nharmony with nature and without compromise, so as to\r\nguarantee the quality of life of succeeding generations.\r\nIn Central America, sustainable development\r\nrepresents an integrated approach to development that\r\nrequires simultaneous efforts, and needs progress to be\r\nmade on the path towards democracy, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment, sustainable economic development and the\r\nsustainable management of natural resources, and\r\nimprovements in the quality of the environment.\r\nIt is evident that the changes foreshadowed here on\r\nthis anniversary within the 185 States which today are\r\nMembers of the United Nations have begun to be felt in the\r\nCentral American isthmus in the context of the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System, our Central American\r\norganization, so that this historic decision of the Heads of\r\nState and Government and the heads of delegations of\r\nMember States of the United Nations to redirect the United\r\nNations so that it better serves mankind, particularly those\r\nwho suffer and lack basic needs, will be supported and\r\nfollowed with particular attention by our organization, given\r\nthe desire to have, in the twenty-first century, a United\r\nNations equipped and structured to serve effectively the\r\ncauses of peace, development, equality and justice.\r\nThe President: I thank the Director of Functional\r\nIntegration at the General Secretariat of the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System for his statement.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Julio Icaza Gallard, Director of\r\nFunctional Integration at the General Secretariat of\r\nthe Central American Integration System, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker for\r\nthis Meeting. I now call on the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nGreetings to you all, at the end of this historic Meeting.\r\nGreetings to the leaders of the world.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLadies and gentlemen, you are part of the largest\r\ngathering of world leaders in history. Your presence\r\nspeaks, as you have spoken, with eloquence, of\r\nconfidence in the future of the United Nations.\r\nOne hundred and twenty-nine Heads of State and\r\nGovernment have come to the United Nations to mark its\r\nfiftieth anniversary. We have listened to the wisdom of\r\nthose leaders. Together they have given the world an\r\nAgenda for Tomorrow. An Agenda covering every aspect\r\nof human society.\r\nThose who made possible this extraordinary event\r\ndeserve our deepest thanks. To Ambassador Butler and\r\nthe Preparatory Committee: your work laid the foundation\r\nfor this successful gathering. And through your work, this\r\nMeeting closes with the adoption of an historic\r\nDeclaration. The States of the world have today\r\nreaffirmed the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, and their commitment to them. They\r\nhave resolved to redirect the United Nations to ever\r\ngreater service to humanity, especially those most in need.\r\nTo the thousands of non-governmental organizations\r\naround the world: you have forged a new global\r\npartnership with the United Nations through your\r\ncontribution to this effort. Out of it will come new\r\nassociations and teaching projects which will vastly\r\nstrengthen our common action in the future.\r\nOur thanks go also to the Observers from non-\r\nMember States and from other organizations; to the heads\r\nof the specialized agencies of the United Nations system;\r\nto the members of my advisory group on the fiftieth\r\nanniversary; to Ms. Sorensen, who has directed UN50; to\r\nthe Protocol Office; to the many global sponsors of this\r\nevent; and to our permanent host, the City of New York.\r\nOn behalf of the United Nations, I express my\r\nappreciation to Mayor Giuliani, Commissioner Sylva, the\r\nNew York Police Department and the people of New\r\nYork City, for their patience, cooperation and warm\r\nwelcome.\r\nNone of this could have been achieved without the\r\ndedication and tireless efforts of the United Nations staff:\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary secretariat; the staff of Conference\r\nServices; of General Assembly Affairs; the interpretation\r\nand translation services; the security personnel, and many,\r\nmany more. All are living, shining examples of the\r\n81\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nUnited Nations and its ideals — of peoples of the world\r\nengaged in service to peoples of the world.\r\nAll of this attendance, this dedication, this hard work,\r\nshow that the United Nations has the support of the citizens\r\nof the world and their leaders. I am convinced that together\r\nwe can enable the United Nations to serve the world of the\r\nfuture.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nDuring these past three days, the family of nations has\r\nbeen meeting in this house of nations, at the moral centre\r\nof the world. During these past three days, the dialogue of\r\nnations sought by the founding fathers has been taking\r\nplace in friendship and fraternity.\r\nDuring these past three days, we have seen the spirit\r\nof San Francisco live again. May this spirit guide us during\r\nnext 50 years to achieve the “virtuous planet” described by\r\nthe Arab philosopher Al-Farabi several centuries ago.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nLong live the United Nations!\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nLong live the United Nations!\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLong live the United Nations!\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nstatement.\r\nWe have come to the end of this Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting of the General Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nI must express my great satisfaction with the fact that it\r\nwas such a great success, showing the world that a Meeting\r\nof this magnitude and importance could be organized so\r\nwell by the United Nations.\r\nFor this success, I should like to thank all the speakers\r\nfor trying to keep to the necessary time-limit. In addition,\r\nI thank the Secretary-General and all the staff and support\r\nunits, and Ms. Gillian Sorensen, without whom we would\r\nhave been unable to meet at all.\r\nMy gratitude goes also and especially to the staff of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nLast but not least, I should like to thank the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary and\r\nits Chairman, Ambassador Richard Butler, whose hard\r\nwork made it all possible.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWhat more eloquent testimony can we find to the\r\nmerits of our Organization than the presence here in New\r\nYork of such a large number of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment? They came to celebrate but they also came\r\nto meet and to exchange ideas amongst themselves on the\r\nfuture of the United Nations, for this international forum\r\nis still the chief framework of international relations. It\r\nstill formulates the fundamental principles of social and\r\neconomic conduct. It is the Assembly that unifies the\r\nnations of the world. Now and henceforth it must\r\ncontinue its function as catalyst for the progress of\r\nmankind.\r\nSince the birth of our Organization 50 years ago, the\r\nnumber of Member countries has more than tripled.\r\nVirtually all the countries of the planet have requested\r\nand been accepted as Members. As far as we know, none\r\nwants to leave. What further proof do we need of the\r\nvalue of the United Nations?\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nThe many statements made from this rostrum have\r\nconstantly referred to the ideals of the United Nations —\r\npeace and development, human rights, international\r\ncooperation. I heard no one defend the practice of war or\r\nthe refusal of assistance to the least fortunate peoples.\r\nNor did I hear anyone praise the virtues of dictatorship or\r\nthe advantages of isolationism.\r\nOf course, it is not enough to proclaim ideals. Ideals\r\nmust be put into practice, but the fact that all the Member\r\n82\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 24 October\r\nStates agree on what the common values of the United\r\nNations are means that part of the work has already been\r\ndone. Now we must work together to agree on the ways of\r\nachieving these ideals.\r\nThese have not been three days of mere words. We\r\nhave seen former leaders of war now transformed into\r\nleaders of peace, nations that in the past suffered under the\r\npower of dictatorship have now become democratic nations\r\nand countries formerly isolated have emerged as members\r\nof important regional organizations committed to\r\nmultilateralism.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nExcellencies, all Member States have recognized the\r\nneed for bold reform. Let the political commitment that has\r\nbeen demonstrated here over the last three days continue in\r\nyour work at the United Nations and let us now go forth\r\nand strengthen our Organization.\r\nOur work has already begun. The many proposals\r\nmade during this Special Commemorative Meeting are part\r\nof the process of reform. Let us keep working together\r\ntowards a better United Nations. Let us face the urgent\r\nfinancial crisis before us and let us lay down the\r\nfoundations of a strong, efficient and visionary Organization\r\nfor the future.\r\nLast night we heard Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and\r\nits Ode to Joy. In that magnificent piece of art, joy is said\r\nto be based on freedom and brotherhood. Let us then\r\ncontinue to work for peace and development together, in\r\nthe hope that one day we will find joy in freedom and\r\nbrotherhood.\r\nI declare closed the Special Commemorative Meeting\r\nof the General Assembly on the occasion of the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this stage\r\nof its consideration of agenda item 29.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 p.m.\r\n83\r\n"
