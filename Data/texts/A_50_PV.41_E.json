(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of Mr. Kenneth K.S. Dadzie\r\nThe President: It is my sad duty to inform the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the death in London yesterday of Mr.\r\nKenneth K.S. Dadzie, former Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD).\r\nMr. Dadzie was the fourth Secretary-General of\r\nUNCTAD. He held that position from 1 January 1986\r\nthrough 31 March 1994. At the time of his death, he was\r\nHigh Commissioner of Ghana to the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr. Dadzie was an\r\noutstanding international civil servant who demonstrated\r\nduring his long and very distinguished career the highest\r\nintellectual and diplomatic skills and the deepest dedication\r\nto the ideals of the United Nations. Mr. Dadzie had\r\ntirelessly promoted the cause of development, and his\r\nlegacy will remain with the United Nations as a benchmark\r\nfor international cooperation.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I should like to\r\nrequest the representative of Ghana to transmit to the\r\nGovernment of Ghana and to the family of Mr. Dadzie our\r\nexpressions of profound sympathy.\r\nMay I ask representatives to stand and observe a\r\nminute of silence in tribute to the memory of Mr. Kenneth\r\nDadzie.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nGhana.\r\nMr. Lamptey (Ghana): First of all, let me thank the\r\nAssembly for its condolences, which I will faithfully\r\ntransmit to the Government and the people of Ghana and\r\nto the family of Ambassador Kenneth K.S. Dadzie.\r\nYesterday was a sad day for Ghana, when we\r\nlearned of the sudden death of this distinguished son of\r\nour country. Kenneth Kweku Sinaman Dadzie was born\r\non 10 September 1930. At Accra High School, at\r\nAchimota College and at Queens College, Cambridge, he\r\nachieved brilliant academic distinction. Before the\r\nindependence of Ghana, he was among the pioneer\r\ntrainees selected by the Government and sent to Britain,\r\nas well as to France and other places, to study for the\r\nGhana Foreign Service. He was attached to the British\r\nForeign Office and subsequently served with the British\r\nEmbassy in Paris. In 1957, he was appointed to the\r\nGhana Foreign Service.\r\nFrom 1960, when he was first sent to New York as\r\nCouncillor Head of Chancery of the Ghana Permanent\r\nMission, he was associated with this Organization,\r\noccupying distinguished positions within the United\r\nNations. He contributed enormously to the work of this\r\nOrganization. He was seconded to the United Nations\r\nfrom the Ghana Permanent Mission in 1963 and held\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nseveral positions. Time will not allow me to enumerate all\r\nof these, but he rose within the system to occupy the post\r\nof Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development. He served his country also as\r\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations Office in\r\nGeneva, and, as you just noted, Sir, he died serving Ghana\r\nas High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.\r\nIn 1980, a grateful nation conferred on him\r\nmembership of the Order of Volta. The people of Ghana\r\nmourn a truly great son, but we believe that representatives\r\nhere know best what this young man who left us so\r\nsuddenly contributed to the world community.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/50/250/Add.1)\r\nLetter from the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences (A/50/404/Add.1)\r\nThe President: This morning, I draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives first to the second report of the General\r\nCommittee (A/50/250/Add.1), concerning two requests:\r\nfirst, a request by the delegation of the Philippines for the\r\ninclusion of an additional item, and secondly, a request by\r\nArgentina, the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,\r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,\r\nEcuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana,\r\nHonduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay,\r\nPeru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Suriname,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela for the\r\ninclusion in the agenda of an additional sub-item under item\r\n112, “Human rights questions”.\r\nIn paragraph 1 of the report, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that the item entitled\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women: Action for Equality, Development\r\nand Peace” be included in the agenda of the current session\r\nand that it should be considered directly in plenary meeting\r\nfor the purpose of endorsing the Beijing Declaration and the\r\nPlatform for Action. The Committee further recommends\r\nthat the item should be allocated to the Second and Third\r\nCommittees as appropriate for its substantive consideration.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts the\r\nrecommendation of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 2 of the report, the\r\nGeneral Committee recommends to the Assembly that an\r\nadditional sub-item, entitled “Report of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights“, should\r\nbe included as a sub-item of agenda item 112, “Human\r\nrights questions”, and that it should be allocated to the\r\nThird Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next turn its\r\nattention to document A/50/404/Add.1, which contains a\r\nletter dated 19 October 1995 addressed to the President of\r\nthe Assembly by the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences. As members are aware, the Assembly, in\r\nparagraph 7 of its resolution 40/243, decided that no\r\nsubsidiary organ should be permitted to meet at United\r\nNations Headquarters during a regular session of the\r\nAssembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.\r\nAs indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the\r\nCommittee on Conferences has recommended that the\r\nGeneral Assembly authorize the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council, the Ad\r\nHoc Open-ended Working Group on An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment and the High-level Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations to\r\nmeet in New York during the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts the\r\nrecommendation of the Committee on Conferences?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 105\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\ncommemoration to mark the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year\r\nThe President: The General Assembly, in\r\naccordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary\r\nmeeting and pursuant to its resolution 49/152 of\r\n23 December 1994, will hold, under agenda item 105, the\r\nfirst of the plenary meetings devoted to marking the tenth\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year and to consider,\r\nwith a view to adopting it, the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond.\r\nI am pleased and gratified to address the Assembly on\r\nthis occasion to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the\r\nInternational Youth Year, and it is particularly interesting\r\nthat this anniversary coincides with the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. The Organization\r\nis reinvigorating itself, and I am convinced that today’s\r\nyouth, when they become the adults of tomorrow, will\r\ndemonstrate their support towards this universal\r\nOrganization and its goals.\r\nFifty years ago the United Nations was founded, based\r\non a noble idea. That idea was — and still is — that each\r\nhuman being has individual dignity and worth. In all, 185\r\ncountries have joined this world body, stating their intention\r\nto voluntarily comply with its principles. These principles,\r\nembodied in the United Nations Charter, speak far better\r\nthan anything else I may say, and are points of light for all\r\nof us.\r\nWith firm belief in these principles, we must reaffirm\r\nour faith by sharing them with our young people. To offer\r\nyouth the opportunity to participate in the development and\r\nrenewal of our societies is the greatest challenge and the\r\ngreatest honour we may afford them. It is also our greatest\r\nresponsibility and our finest reward.\r\nToday the international community has gathered to\r\nreflect on the achievements and problems confronting\r\nyouth, in order to advance the common historic purpose\r\nstarted in 1985 during International Youth Year. We are\r\nhere today to build upon the positive processes created\r\nsince the adoption in 1965 by the General Assembly of the\r\nDeclaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of\r\nPeace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples\r\n(resolution 2037 (XX)).\r\nInvesting in the youth of today enables them, as\r\nindividuals, to fulfil their lifetime’s potential. The benefits\r\nto young women and men can be counted in terms of\r\nindividual achievement and self-development. For the\r\nnation, its gains are through tapping the storehouse of\r\nenergy, resourcefulness, labour and enthusiasm of its youth.\r\nSuch gains are not achieved without costs. Governments\r\nneed to develop policies and invest in programmes which\r\nprovide their young men and women with the opportunities\r\nto participate fully in the nation’s economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is my sincere hope that this special plenary will be\r\na landmark in the process of refining the international\r\ncommunity’s response to the challenge of youth, for those\r\nof us gathered here represent all sectors of society:\r\nGovernments, which have the ultimate responsibility for\r\nsolving the problems of youth; United Nations\r\norganizations and bodies, with their enriching expertise\r\nand specific mandates; intergovernmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, particularly youth\r\norganizations — all are valuable partners with unique\r\nexperience. I am confident that from these deliberations\r\ntoday, we will strengthen our commitment to the\r\nobjectives of the World Programme of Action for Youth\r\nto the Year 2000 and Beyond.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nMr. Desai (Under-Secretary-General for Policy\r\nCoordination and Sustainable Development): May I begin\r\nfirst by apologizing on behalf of the Secretary-General,\r\nwho would very much have liked to be present because\r\nhe has laid great stress on the importance of relating the\r\nwork of the United Nations to the concerns of young\r\npeople all over the world.\r\nJust a few days ago the leaders of the world came\r\ntogether in this Hall, in a gathering which was both\r\nunprecedented and of immense significance, when they\r\ncelebrated the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. As\r\nwe commemorated 50 years of the United Nations, we\r\nalso looked to the tasks and challenges that lie in the\r\nyears ahead, and especially to the challenge of preserving\r\nand strengthening the United Nations as a unique force\r\nfor the maintenance of peace and in promoting\r\ndevelopment and social progress.\r\nReaching out to the young was the theme of many\r\nactivities linked to the commemoration, and it is indeed\r\nappropriate that the very first act of the Assembly\r\nfollowing the celebration of the Organization’s fiftieth\r\nbirthday is to turn the spotlight on young people — our\r\nfuture — to those who will have to nurture, maintain and\r\nrun this institution in its next 50 years. Let me, therefore,\r\nwelcome the participants who have gathered here today,\r\nwho represent so many who are devoted and dedicated to\r\nthe well-being of young people all over the world. I\r\nwelcome the Ministers and high-level officials present. I\r\nwelcome the youth representatives, and I welcome\r\nparticularly the representatives of the young\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nDuring the course of these plenary meetings, the\r\nAssembly will formally adopt, we hope, a World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond. The central purpose of the Programme of Action\r\nis to provide a policy framework and practical guidelines\r\nfor national action and international support to improve the\r\nsituation of young people. It emphasizes the measures that\r\ncan best provide opportunities for young men and women\r\nfor full, effective and constructive participation in society.\r\nIn a formal sense, the United Nations considers the\r\nage range from 15 to 24 as representing the youth life span,\r\nand measured in this sense there are about a billion young\r\npeople in the world today. But young people of similar age\r\noften face very different problems, and live in surroundings\r\nthat are as dissimilar as the conditions of the societies at\r\nlarge. Given all these important differences, it is not always\r\neasy to keep focused on the one core issue that binds youth\r\ntogether — on what one could call the essence of being\r\nyoung. That essence which defines youth is that youth is a\r\nperiod of transition. It is a passage from childhood and\r\ndependence to adulthood with its attendant rights and\r\nresponsibilities. To make that passage safer, easier and\r\nconstructive — that is the focus of all youth activities for\r\nthe well-being of the individual and the benefit of society.\r\nIn all of us there exists both a conformist and a\r\nrebellious streak. Over a life span, the individual comes to\r\nreconcile the conflicting poles. In young people, that\r\nconflict is at its most intense.\r\nYoung men and women wish to fit into society and,\r\nyet, seeing the world with an uncynical eye, they also wish\r\nto change the world for the better. An enlightened youth\r\npolicy creates a climate in which the appropriate balance\r\nbetween conformism and rebelliousness can best be struck.\r\nAll of us, young and old, have a desire to be heard. But to\r\nget a hearing is not easy when one is young. It is, in fact,\r\noften a rare privilege. So, it is the underlying premise of\r\nthe draft world Programme of Action that the best chance\r\nfor success, for realizing its goals, is to be found in the\r\nconcept of partnership. The value of the contribution that\r\nyoung people can make is maximized when their voices are\r\nheard. These voices, I should like to add, were certainly\r\nheard in the processes that brought the draft Programme of\r\nAction into being. Keeping in focus this dimension, the\r\ndraft Programme addresses many practical concerns and\r\nissues, and I should like to refer to a few of them.\r\nAlmost 85 per cent of our young people live in\r\ndeveloping countries. Their opportunities for education and\r\ntraining often remain limited, and social services are\r\nlacking. There is an incongruity, an imbalance, in many\r\ncountries between education and the needs of the\r\nworkplace. Rates of youth unemployment are much\r\nhigher than average in practically every country and its\r\nthis unemployment which often generates a sense of\r\nhopelessness and often contributes to social stress. The\r\npolicies required to tackle youth unemployment are\r\nqualitatively different from those required for employment\r\npolicy in general. We have to focus on new jobs for\r\nyouth and not just protection of existing jobs.\r\nYoung people, as we can see so frequently,\r\nconstitute a significant proportion of the refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons created by conflicts. Amongst young\r\npeople, young women continue to encounter\r\ndiscrimination. Eighty-six million girls have no access to\r\nprimary school education. Unemployment rates for young\r\nwomen remain higher than for young men. Exploitation\r\nand violence add to the impoverishment of young women.\r\nGlobally, pregnancy-related complications are the main\r\ncause of death for girls between 15 and 19 years of age.\r\nA large proportion of rural youth do not enjoy the\r\nbenefits of development and progress because of the lack\r\nof access to resources, because of the lack of\r\nemployment. A very large number of young people live\r\nin poverty as officially defined. Malnutrition, sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases, particularly AIDS, and substance\r\nabuse are decimating young people in many parts of the\r\nworld. Juvenile delinquency, and crime and violence by\r\nand against young people, are major problems around the\r\nworld. The rapid transformation of many societies has\r\nweakened the capacity of families in the role of nurturing\r\nand socializing young people and equipping them for life.\r\nThis role has not been fulfilled adequately by other\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThese are but some of the dimensions which have\r\nfigured in the discussions on this draft Programme of\r\nAction, and some of the reasons why a particular focus\r\non youth is necessary as a critical dimension of the\r\npursuit of social progress.\r\nThe concern of the United Nations over youth found\r\nits expression in the proclamation in 1985 of International\r\nYouth Year. Within the framework of that Year, Member\r\nStates have developed measures to improve youth\r\nprogrammes and to mobilize resources. The Year also\r\nprovided an opportunity to articulate a policy on youth,\r\nnot just in isolation but as an integral part of a complex\r\noverall social reality. The various entities of the United\r\nNations system, including the regional commissions, have\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nworked to provide the necessary international support for\r\nthe objectives of the Year. They have strengthened their\r\nyouth-oriented activities, stressing an integrated approach to\r\nyouth concerns. Most important, non-governmental\r\norganizations have played a vital role in articulating the\r\nconcerns of young people and in youth development\r\nactivities in the framework of the Year, particularly as\r\ninnovators at the community, local and grass-roots level.\r\nThey have been a vital interlocutor with youth and have\r\ngiven life and participation to the process in a very\r\nauthentic manner.\r\nThe draft Programme of Action incorporates many\r\nvaluable initiatives generated in the many conferences that\r\nhave been held. Today, we reaffirm that the needs and\r\naspirations of young people are a global priority; that it is\r\nthe right of young people to contribute to and participate in\r\nthe life of society; that it is the responsibility of\r\nGovernments to strive to create the necessary conditions.\r\nAnd to this end, we need a renewed sense of cooperation\r\nbetween Member States, the United Nations system, the\r\nprivate non-governmental organizations sector, and civil\r\nsociety. The adoption of the draft World Programme of\r\nAction is, of course, an important step. But, beyond that we\r\nneed more active and continued advocacy, more form and\r\ncommitment and more tangible actions. Governmental\r\naction will not be enough; we need the commitment of\r\nyoung people, the commitment of non-governmental\r\norganizations and the commitment of the United Nations\r\nsystem to support this process.\r\nFifty years from now, many who are here will surely\r\nbe present in this room to commemorate the centenary of\r\nthis institution. It must be our aim and hope that when they\r\ndo so, they will be able to look back on a century of action\r\nand achievement to which they have been able to\r\ncontribute — action and achievement for peace, justice and\r\ndevelopment for all people. I look forward to the debate\r\nand assure the General Assembly of the continued\r\ncommitment of all the organizations of the United Nations\r\nsystem to promoting the concerns which are expressed, and\r\nthe actions which are contemplated in the draft Programme\r\nwhich the Assembly will be considering.\r\nThe President: I should like to propose that the list of\r\nspeakers for the plenary meetings devoted to marking the\r\ntenth anniversary of International Youth Year be closed at\r\n11.15 this morning.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I therefore request those\r\nrepresentatives wishing to participate in the plenary\r\nmeetings devoted to marking the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year to place their names on the list\r\nof speakers as soon as possible.\r\nI now call on the representative of Spain, Mrs. Rosa\r\nEscapa, who will speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nMrs. Escapa (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI have the honour, on behalf of the European Union, to\r\nparticipate in this special meeting of the General\r\nAssembly to mark the tenth anniversary of International\r\nYouth Year. This anniversary represents a unique\r\nopportunity to assess the situation of youth around the\r\nworld, and to consider the steps to be taken in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nIn 1985, International Youth Year, the world youth\r\npopulation, that is persons aged between 15 and 24 years,\r\nwas 941 million. In 1995, the world youth population is\r\nestimated to be 1 billion. According to United Nations\r\nestimates, 85.9 per cent of the world’s youth population\r\nlives in developing countries.\r\nYoung people constitute the major human resource\r\nfor development in our societies. They are, in many\r\nsectors, the key agents for social change and technological\r\ninnovation. But young people, particularly in developing\r\ncountries, experience difficulties related to the lack of\r\nadequate educational, training and employment\r\nopportunities, as well as access to only poor health\r\nfacilities and services. All of these factors can fuel social\r\nexclusion and marginalization.\r\nYoung people are especially vulnerable to poverty.\r\nYouth unemployment and underemployment are also\r\nprominent features of most societies around the world. In\r\naddition, rapid socio-economic change can be a cause of\r\nincreased juvenile delinquency and drug abuse.\r\nInternational Youth Year, proclaimed by the United\r\nNations in 1985, based its strategies on three distinct, yet\r\ninterrelated, themes: participation, development and peace.\r\nThe objectives of the International Youth Year were set\r\nout in the guidelines for further planning and suitable\r\nfollow-up in the field of youth, which served as a\r\nconceptual framework for youth work in ensuing years.\r\nInternational Youth Year contributed to the creation,\r\nparticularly at the national level, of channels of\r\ncommunication and participation for youth. It also helped\r\nto direct attention to youth issues on national agendas, to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nestablish national youth programmes and to strengthen\r\nyouth organizations. The European Union holds the view\r\nthat these goals of the International Youth Year are as valid\r\ntoday as they were a decade ago, and it considers that the\r\ndraft World Programme of Action for Youth to the\r\nYear 2000 and Beyond will constitute an important step in\r\nfurther promoting the aspirations of young people to\r\nparticipate fully in and to contribute actively to the life of\r\nour societies. We consider that it is the responsibility of\r\nStates to facilitate and promote such participation.\r\nThe European Union hopes that the consensus\r\nachieved last week in the negotiations on the draft World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth will be maintained. We\r\nhope that the additional concerns that some delegations may\r\nhave can be accommodated by international intervention\r\nand that the draft Programme of Action will be adopted\r\nduring these special meetings.\r\nThe draft World Programme of Action for Youth pays\r\nspecial attention to the issue of youth participation. This is\r\nnot only one of the specific priority areas but also an\r\noverriding general principle. The draft Programme also\r\nstrongly emphasizes that its implementation requires the full\r\nenjoyment by young people of all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nImplementation of the draft Programme, as the\r\nProgramme itself states, is ultimately the responsibility of\r\nGovernments, with the support of the international\r\ncommunity. Young people should be involved, at all\r\nappropriate levels, in the formulation, implementation and\r\nevaluation of youth policy. At the international level, the\r\nWorld Youth Forum can play an important role in the\r\nimplementation of the draft Programme. Young men and\r\nyoung women have many needs in common, but it is all too\r\neasy to forget the specific needs of young women when\r\nprogrammes for young people are being developed. It is\r\nimportant also that governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations alike actively take up young women’s as well\r\nas young men’s concerns at every stage of the planning of\r\ntheir programmes.\r\nI should like to refer now to some aspects of the\r\nsituation and concerns of young people in the context of the\r\nEuropean Union. There are almost 60 million young people\r\nbetween the ages of 15 and 25 in the European Union.\r\nTheir participation and active involvement in the\r\nconstruction of Europe, as citizens conscious of their rights\r\nand responsibilities, are an enormous potential for our\r\nsocieties, on which the future of the Union depends.\r\nSectoral policies affecting young people, and especially the\r\ncommunity programmes specifically targeted at the\r\nyoung, are tools for the development of a European\r\nUnion policy of cooperation in the field of youth. In the\r\nEuropean Union the policy of cooperation on youth issues\r\nis part of a broad concept of developing active citizenship\r\non the part of young people. To move towards the\r\ndevelopment of active citizenship, the European Union\r\nhas begun coordinated action, especially through the\r\nYouth for Europe programme, aimed at supporting the\r\nyouth socio-educational process outside the formal\r\neducational framework.\r\nExchanges between youth groups and youth\r\nassociations are important mechanisms of Community\r\ncooperation policy in the field of youth. Within the\r\nframework of these mechanisms, projects designed and\r\ncarried out by young people themselves, pursuant to their\r\nown interests — projects in various thematic areas, such\r\nas the fight against social exclusion and racism,\r\nconservation of local heritage, protection of the\r\nenvironment, cultural and artistic expression, employment,\r\nhealth and youth rights — contribute to the active\r\ncommitment of young people to a social integration\r\nprocess and to the development of their social,\r\nprofessional, cultural and personal attitudes.\r\nA policy of cooperation in the field of youth that\r\nfocused exclusively on the intra-Community level would\r\nnot be complete and would go against our basic principles\r\non the development of active citizenship on the part of\r\nyoung people.\r\nFinally, it is important to point out that cooperation\r\non youth issues in the European Union cannot be\r\ndeveloped effectively without the active participation of\r\nyoung people through their representative structures,\r\nparticularly the World Youth Forum.\r\nThe European Union cooperates actively with other\r\ncountries on youth issues. This cooperation includes the\r\nexchange of knowledge and experience in respect of such\r\nmatters as youth employment, the training of youth\r\ndirectors and information related to youth. It also involves\r\nthe promotion of exchange programmes with young\r\npeople from countries outside the European Union.\r\nWe also want to take this opportunity to recognize\r\nand stress the importance of the contribution of the\r\nCouncil of Europe in respect of youth issues. An example\r\nof this contribution is the current European youth\r\ncampaign against racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism and\r\nintolerance.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nThe success of efforts in the elaboration of the draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth depends primarily\r\non Government commitment to its implementation at the\r\nnational level, with the full involvement of youth.\r\nAll the recent major United Nations Conferences have\r\ndevoted attention to the specific needs of youth. The United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\ncalled for the involvement of youth in environment and\r\ndevelopment planning and decision-making as well as in the\r\nsubsequent implementation of measures adopted. The\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\ngave attention to the reproductive rights and reproductive\r\nhealth of young people as well as to a number of related\r\npopulation issues. The World Summit for Children and the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, the latter of which\r\nwas held in Vienna, put emphasis on the rights of the child\r\nand the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms by all.\r\nFurthermore, the Fourth World Conference on Women\r\nstressed again that gender roles greatly affect the situation\r\nof young people. Young women and girls face\r\ndiscrimination in all societies from an early age, particularly\r\nwith regard to access, on an equal basis with boys and\r\nyoung men, to the opportunities that society offers, as well\r\nas participation in the decision-making processes at all\r\nlevels. Equal rights, including sexual rights such as the right\r\nof the individual to have control over and decide freely on\r\nmatters related to his or her sexuality, was one of the\r\naspects stressed by the Beijing Conference.\r\nIn Copenhagen, on the occasion of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, Heads of State and Government\r\nagreed to give the highest priority in national, regional and\r\ninternational policies and actions to the promotion of social\r\nprogress, justice and the betterment of the human condition,\r\nbased on full participation for all. The Summit\r\nacknowledged and considered the contribution of people of\r\nall age groups as equally and vitally important for the\r\nbuilding of a harmonious society, and stressed the need for\r\nfostering dialogue between generations in all parts of\r\nsociety. More specifically, the Summit underlined the need\r\nto give special attention to long-term unemployment and\r\nunderemployment of youth within national efforts to put the\r\ncreation of employment and the reduction of unemployment\r\nat the centre of strategies and policies of governments. In\r\nthe present context, that also underlines the need for\r\nproviding access to education for all.\r\nThe Programme of Action adopted by the Summit also\r\nstressed the need for:\r\n“Encouraging youth to participate in\r\ndiscussions and decisions affecting them and in the\r\ndesign, implementation and evaluation of policies\r\nand programmes; ensuring that youth acquire the\r\nskills to participate in all aspects of life in society\r\nand to lead self-sufficient lives through the provision\r\nof relevant and innovative educational programmes;\r\nand establishing laws and measures that ensure the\r\nprotection of youth against physical and mental\r\nabuse and economic exploitation”. (A/CONF.166/9,\r\nannex II, para. 75 (i))\r\nThe European Union thinks that the follow-up of the\r\noutcomes of the recent major United Nation conferences\r\nshould form the appropriate framework for future\r\nactivities related to youth issues. We believe that the draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action we are adopting should be\r\nplaced in this global perspective. The participation of\r\nyouth — young men and women — in the\r\nimplementation of the World Programme of Action will\r\nbe the best way of pursuing our efforts to ensure that\r\nyoung people find their rightful place in our societies.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Martin Kargl,\r\nYouth Representative of Austria.\r\nMr. Kargl (Austria): Before I start, let me point out\r\nthat I fully endorse the statement just made by the\r\nSpanish delegate on behalf of the European Union. Please\r\nlet me add some comments from a youth’s perspective.\r\nOn behalf of Austria’s young women and men and\r\nthe Austrian youth organizations, I am glad to convey to\r\nyou our warmest congratulations on this fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Charter of the United Nations. The\r\nefforts made to achieve the aims of the United Nations\r\nCharter are, despite all problems, indispensable and must\r\nnot be underestimated by any government or organization\r\ntoday or the future. We, today’s young generation, feel\r\nresponsible for upholding and spreading the spirit of the\r\nCharter.\r\nYoung people must have a more important role in\r\nthe social and political development of the world. We no\r\nlonger want to be objects of governments’ youth policies,\r\nbut want to participate fully in building our own future.\r\nThis future must be one of peace and justice. Therefore,\r\nall young people and youth organizations have to be\r\nrecognized as partners of governments at all levels. The\r\nreform process now under way within the United Nations\r\nsystem should include the creation of a proper framework\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nin which non-governmental youth organizations can meet\r\nand participate.\r\nIn Austria, more and more, youth organizations are\r\nsuccessfully involved in the political decision-making\r\nprocess. The co-management system between youth\r\nnon-governmental organizations and governments, well\r\nestablished in the Council of Europe since 1972, is now\r\nalso implemented at the national level. For the first time,\r\neveryone is working together on an equal footing in the\r\nEuropean Youth Campaign against Racism, Xenophobia,\r\nAntisemitism and Intolerance. We would also like to see\r\nthis co-management within the United Nations, in order to\r\nimprove the quality of United Nations youth work.\r\nIn the same spirit, I hope that more countries will\r\nfollow the Austrian example by involving their youth\r\norganizations in national youth policies and in their work\r\nwithin the United Nations.\r\nIn the follow-up to International Youth Year in\r\nAustria, local, regional and national children and youth\r\nparliaments took place. At the same time, independent\r\nombudspersons were appointed to protect the rights of\r\nchildren and youth.\r\nThe historic changes in Central and Eastern Europe\r\naffected the life and future of all young people in Austria.\r\nYouth exchange and training programmes with countries in\r\ntransition have been organized in the spirit of peace and\r\nmutual understanding.\r\nA major national initiative resulting from International\r\nYouth Year is HOPE ’87, which stands for “Hundreds of\r\nOriginal Projects for Employment”. This Association is\r\naffiliated with the United Nations and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and is\r\nactive in more than 15 countries around the world. Austria\r\nis the main contributor. HOPE ’87 creates jobs for young\r\npeople and supports training programmes by providing\r\ngrant schemes and seed money for self-employment.\r\nHOPE ’87 supports the reconstruction of educational\r\nfacilities in Sarajevo and the vocational training of\r\nwar-disabled young people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nI have mentioned the positive cooperation between my\r\nGovernment and Austrian non-governmental organizations\r\nin the ongoing campaign against racism and intolerance. In\r\nthis respect I want to draw attention to the recent report of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees which\r\nsupports the struggle of non-governmental organizations in\r\nthe field of human rights and youth for an asylum law in\r\nfull accordance with the Geneva Convention relating to\r\nthe Status of Refugees and other human rights\r\ninstruments.\r\nAs representative of the Austrian Youth Council I\r\nwelcome the United Nations headquarters in Vienna. I\r\nhope that the United Nations will continue to be a place\r\nwhere youth organizations have a voice, so that youth can\r\nstill trust someone over 50.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Ecuador, Mr. Valencia Rodríguez.\r\nMr. Valencia Rodriguez (Ecuador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I am honoured to speak on behalf of the\r\nfollowing countries, members of the Rio Group:\r\nArgentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay\r\nand Venezuela.\r\nIt is a fortunate coincidence that young people are\r\nmeeting in New York at the very time that we are\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. The leaders of the world have reflected on the\r\nachievements of the Organization and on the important\r\nrole that the Organization can appropriately play in the\r\nfuture, in the next millennium.\r\nThe contradictions of relations between peoples and\r\ntechnological and scientific advances are a sign of our\r\ntimes. The problems go beyond the borders of States and\r\nrequire joint and common action to tackle them and\r\ndevelop strategies in order to work together for a new\r\nworld of peace and equity.\r\nWe are convinced that it is necessary as a matter of\r\npriority to deal with young people’s problems, which have\r\nbecome particularly acute because of the difficult\r\neconomic and social circumstances most countries are\r\nundergoing. Differences in living standards between the\r\nindustrialized countries and the developing countries have\r\nbecome more marked. The highest percentage of young\r\npeople is to be found in our countries — 84 per cent in\r\n1995 — and it is projected that this figure will increase\r\nto 89 per cent by the year 2025.\r\nPoverty in our countries directly affects our young\r\npeople, who cannot develop their potential because of the\r\nlack of opportunities in education, unemployment, the\r\nshortage of recreational centres, and inadequate health\r\nservices, among other problems. Urban marginalization is\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\ngrowing and its effects are well-known — juvenile\r\nviolence, drug addiction, illiteracy.\r\nThe youth of the world, as a force for renewal, have\r\nthe ability to play a more active role in the decision-making\r\nprocess in society. In the face of future challenges, special\r\nattention must be paid to their problems, needs and\r\naspirations.\r\nIn that respect, we endorse the provisions of General\r\nAssembly resolutions 49/152 and 49/154 of\r\n23 December 1994. They point the way to mobilizing all\r\nthe creativity and energy of youth to build a new\r\ncommunity of nations based on mutual understanding,\r\nrespect for cultural, religious and racial differences, equal\r\nrights for men and women, and social and economic well-\r\nbeing for all.\r\nMr. Odlum (Saint Lucia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nOur countries attach particular importance to economic\r\nand social conditions, whose deterioration has not only\r\naffected the physical, intellectual and emotional\r\ndevelopment of young people, but is threatening their very\r\nsurvival.\r\nYoung people’s conduct, with these obvious social\r\ndisadvantages, will lead to widespread problems. In the\r\nnear future, new families will be formed with similar\r\nconflicts. This could result in a serious deterioration in the\r\nsocial nucleus and inevitably limit the possibilities of full\r\ndevelopment of a large portion of the world’s population.\r\nWe believe that educational programmes play a\r\nparticularly important role. The contents of these\r\nprogrammes must be designed to promote respect for\r\nhuman rights and protection of the environment, and to\r\ngenerate an atmosphere of peace, understanding and mutual\r\nrespect among peoples.\r\nThe countries of the Rio Group believe in the need to\r\nimplement mechanisms for regional and global cooperation\r\nwith a view to promoting technical cooperation, research\r\nand communication among the young people of the entire\r\nworld.\r\nThe competent United Nations bodies should intensify\r\ntheir efforts to formulate and implement plans of action for\r\nthe development of youth. Special emphasis must be placed\r\non health programmes, malnutrition, poverty, education,\r\nhousing, juvenile delinquency and drug abuse. Young\r\npeople should play a dynamic part in all activities to\r\npromote and recognize their rights.\r\nFinally, our countries wish to state that they attribute\r\nspecial importance to the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth, and we reiterate our commitment to the\r\nimplementation of all the recently adopted international\r\ninstruments concerning the protection of the environment\r\nand human rights, the declarations on social development,\r\nand the Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women. It is on the\r\nbasis of these instruments that strategies and actions will\r\nbe defined to tackle the problems of today’s youth and\r\nprotect the rights of future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Mr. Lakshman\r\nKadirgamar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Kadirgamar (Sri Lanka): Allow me first to\r\nrefer to the late Mr. Kenneth Dadzie, whose death last\r\nnight in London we deeply mourn. I wish to say that\r\nMr. Dadzie was a good friend to Sri Lanka. He worked\r\nwith us and our officials over many decades of activity in\r\ninternational forums. I knew him myself personally very\r\nwell, and so did many of those who have represented our\r\ncountry in the last few decades. We would like to join\r\nsincerely in the expressions of condolence and the tributes\r\nthat have been paid to him this morning.\r\nI am particularly pleased to participate in this special\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly devoted to youth issues.\r\nSri Lanka and other non-aligned countries at the Cairo\r\nMinisterial Meeting contributed to developing the\r\nconsensus which paved the way for this high-level\r\nmeeting.\r\nIn Sri Lanka, the Government and the opposition\r\nparties are united in the high priority we all accord to the\r\nproblems of youth. Youth questions are closely\r\nintertwined with key social development as well as peace\r\nand security issues. The special attention being given to\r\nyouth issues is timely. A global youth population of over\r\none billion represents a dynamic force of creativity and\r\nchange. Young people are the principal agents of change.\r\nThey are at the same time the beneficiary or victim of\r\nthose changes. They continue to grapple with the obvious,\r\nbut yet to be resolved, dilemma of whether to integrate\r\nwith the existing order or to serve as a force for\r\ntransforming that order.\r\nUnited Nations statistics show that the majority of\r\nthe world youth population lives in the developing world.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nThe youth potential, either as a force of stability and\r\nprosperity, or as a vehicle for instability and violence would\r\nnaturally be manifest in greater intensity and visibility in\r\nthe developing world. It is therefore vital that we take\r\ncognizance of the problems and the promise of young\r\npeople and provide opportunities and encouragement for\r\nthem to channel their energies into socially desirable\r\nactivities. Frustrated youth aspirations have often given rise\r\nto recurring social instability and political violence within\r\nStates. Societies and the established order neglect youth\r\naspirations at their peril. History is replete with instances of\r\nyouth frustration militating against development and social\r\nprogress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing\r\npolitical and social institutions were either unwilling or\r\nunable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to\r\nyouth problems and aspirations. I must, with a sense of\r\nsadness, refer to a distressing development which is not\r\nunique to Sri Lanka. It is the use of children in war. In our\r\nown internal conflict youths, sometimes as young as 10\r\nyears of age, have been conscripted for war by a militant\r\nethnic group. I will not go into detail, as I have already\r\ndone so in my statement to the General Assembly a few\r\nweeks ago.\r\nYoung people worldwide are a major human resource\r\nfor progress and the prime movers of innovation. The\r\nimagination and idealism of youth and their collective\r\nenergies would be the creative impulse for any vision of the\r\nfuture for any nation. The problems young people face and\r\nthe drive they manifest provide political indices for devising\r\nstrategies for socio-economic development. The degree to\r\nwhich the Governments and the established order\r\nsuccessfully address youth problems and the manner in\r\nwhich they utilize the youth potential and meet the\r\nchallenges presented by them could determine the extent of\r\nsuccess of any society, any Government or any country.\r\nWe are therefore very happy that the General\r\nAssembly decided to devote this meeting to mark the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year and to consider the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000\r\nand Beyond. Sri Lanka notes with appreciation the work\r\naccomplished by the Commission on Social Development\r\nand the Secretariat to finalize the World Programme of\r\nAction. Sri Lanka has made its own contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of these plans. The decade since the adoption\r\nof the International Youth Year has been an eventful one in\r\nterms of profound changes that have taken place within and\r\namong nations. The World Programme of Action provides\r\na good framework and multi-sectoral standards relevant to\r\npolicy making, as well as specific action at international,\r\nregional and, most importantly, the national levels. In the\r\nfinal analysis however, young people themselves, together\r\nwith their national Governments and their grass-roots\r\norganizations, should develop the most appropriate and\r\nviable partnerships in order to address and resolve the\r\nproblems of youth in the priority areas identified by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe note that the Programme of Action has been\r\nconceived as an indicative framework for integrated\r\naction with a view to enhancing young people’s\r\nparticipation in society. This will afford sufficient\r\nflexibility for national Governments, national\r\norganizations and young people themselves to develop\r\ntheir own models and institutions. In this context, we\r\nwere pleased to note that the document produced by the\r\nCommission on Social Development and the Secretariat\r\nhas taken on board several of the areas identified by\r\ndeveloping countries as requiring priority action, such as\r\neducation, employment, poverty, health, drug abuse, girls\r\nand young women. Sri Lanka for its part provided its\r\ninputs to the deliberations leading to the finalization of\r\nthe Programme of Action, and we note with appreciation\r\nthat the overriding theme of the Programme of Action is\r\nfacilitating the effective participation of youth in the life\r\nof society and in the decision-making process.\r\nWe in Sri Lanka have taken concerted action to\r\nrationalize and coordinate vocational and technical\r\ntraining centres through reforms based on a\r\ncomprehensive research programme. With the opening up\r\nof the Sri Lankan economy, it has been our policy to\r\nrectify the imbalance between the labour market demand\r\nand the output of the education system. The\r\nrationalization of vocational training is geared to a\r\ndemand-driven training system that can assist the\r\nexpanding private sector, where the bulk of the future\r\nemployment opportunities would be available to young\r\npeople. The overall objective of this strategy is to rectify\r\nthe so-called education-employment mismatch.\r\nAction is being taken to consult industry in\r\ndesigning and managing relevant education and training\r\nsystems, while emphasis is also given to developing\r\ntraining courses which are market responsive.\r\nAs regards the other priority areas of hunger and\r\npoverty, we have already registered considerable\r\nachievements in meeting the basic needs of the people\r\nand in ensuring basic nutritional intake. This has been\r\naugmented by the launching of the Samurdhi, or\r\nprosperity, movement in the country, which will\r\neffectively act as a cushion for vulnerable groups against\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nthe economic burdens of a liberalized economy. The\r\ntimeliness of launching a global movement to ensure\r\nprosperity for all in this era of rapid globalization of\r\neconomic activities was noted at the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, held in Copenhagen. In Sri Lanka, the\r\nSamurdhi programme is designed to activate the\r\nentrepreneurial potential of the poor. The young people\r\naffected by poverty are thus given the opportunity and the\r\nresource base to develop self-reliant entrepreneurship at the\r\nlocal level, utilizing local market potential and appropriate\r\ntechnology. The programme’s emphasis on measures\r\ntargeted on rural youth is particularly welcome, as these\r\nmeasures cover a broad front for action in a variety of\r\nfields such as agriculture, skill training, land, industry and\r\nfood production.\r\nWith regard to drug abuse, Sri Lanka has a\r\ncomprehensive national policy based on enforcement,\r\npreventive education, treatment, rehabilitation and\r\ninternational and regional cooperation. As regards girls and\r\nyoung women, Sri Lanka and other South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries\r\nhave been at the forefront in the protection and promotion\r\nof the rights of female children and women. A series of\r\nspecific national and regional meetings at the highest level\r\nwas convened to address these issues, and vigorous national\r\nand regional initiatives are under way. SAARC Heads of\r\nState or Government have always attached priority to youth\r\nissues. Social stability and economic development in this\r\nhighly populous region of the world will be greatly\r\ndependent upon the satisfaction of the aspirations of youth.\r\nThere are other aspects of importance addressed in the\r\nWorld Programme before the Assembly at this plenary\r\nmeeting. One of the most important is the need for, and the\r\nessential role of, international cooperation to promote\r\nconditions conducive to the implementation of the\r\nProgramme. There is no doubt that the main focus of\r\nattention and the principal actors in the implementation will\r\nbe at the national level. It is, however, equally important\r\nthat international and regional cooperation and assistance\r\nshould be forthcoming in a generous manner.\r\nWe have seen many well-meaning international\r\ndocuments and commitments remain unrealized because of\r\nthe paucity of resources and lack of institutional support.\r\nWe only hope that the implementation of the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth will not suffer the same\r\nfate. Youth issues are far too important a matter to be\r\nsidelined or neglected for want of funds. The cross-\r\npollination of ideas which will be a natural outgrowth of\r\ninternational cooperative activities on this issue could very\r\nwell enrich and enhance national action.\r\nNon-governmental organizations could also contribute to\r\nthis process. There is therefore a need to develop an\r\neffective partnership between the key players,\r\nGovernments, intergovernmental bodies, youth\r\norganizations and other interested non-governmental\r\norganizations. We hope that the final outcome of this\r\nhigh-level meeting will give a strong impetus to\r\ndeveloping such partnerships among the principal actors\r\nin this field so that the World Programme of Action will\r\nhave sound institutional and political support at all\r\nlevels — international, regional and national.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Ordzhonikidze (Russian Federation)\r\n(interpretation from Russian): It is very significant that\r\nthis solemn meeting of the General Assembly on the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year has coincided\r\nprecisely with the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, for youth is the most dynamic and promising\r\nsector of society. Speaking metaphorically, it is the gold\r\nreserve of each country and of our entire planet.\r\nIt is also emblematic that we are considering\r\nproblems of youth at the time when we are\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the\r\nSecond World War, for it was precisely the young who\r\nhad to bear the brunt of the war: it was they who had to\r\ndon uniforms and die and on the battlefield instead of\r\ndoing productive work to help their countries flourish. For\r\nRussia this subject is particularly sensitive. Most of the\r\n26 million victims of the war were young people who\r\nnever had a chance to establish a family, raise children or\r\nhelp improve their countries. The consequences of this\r\nhorrible tragedy still have repercussions for our country,\r\nas they do for many others. For this reason, we are very\r\npleased that at this jubilee session the General Assembly,\r\non the initiative of Russia and other countries of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, adopted the\r\nDeclaration in Commemoration of the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the End of the Second World War. We\r\nhope that all States will take account of the errors of the\r\npast in order to safeguard for youth a future without wars,\r\nconflicts, xenophobia, racism, nationalism or political and\r\nsocio-economic crises.\r\nThe world community, if it is united, can succeed in\r\nsolving even the most difficult problems of youth. In that\r\ncontext, we find it appropriate and necessary to develop\r\nand adopt the World Programme of Action for Youth to\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nthe Year 2000 and Beyond. The Russian delegation took an\r\nactive part in all stages of the preparation of this document,\r\nwhich is unique and comprehensive in terms of its effect on\r\nglobal development. The balanced draft Programme reflects\r\nthe various problems of young people in all countries,\r\nincluding those in transition. The document sets out the\r\nfundamental areas for work in respect of youth, and its\r\nimplementation will determine whether in the near future\r\nwe will create the conditions necessary for each country’s\r\nsustainable development or conditions for crisis and\r\nconflict, which, in today’s interdependent world, would\r\ninevitably spill over State borders and adversely affect the\r\nsocial, economic and political situation of the world at\r\nlarge.\r\nI must note, unfortunately, that yesterday attempts\r\nwere made to amend the agreed draft, which prevented the\r\nProgramme from being adopted at the meeting of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. We hope that the differences\r\nwill be overcome so that we can still adopt the document\r\non schedule.\r\nThe universality of youth problems is reflected in the\r\ndocuments of the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on Women.\r\nThe preparations for those very important forums involved\r\nthe participation of almost all United Nations bodies and\r\nspecialized agencies. Therefore, in the light of the interest\r\nshown by all groups of countries, it would probably be\r\nappropriate to prepare an inter-agency plan of action on\r\nyouth, with effective follow-up machinery for\r\nimplementation. By the same token, clearly, no international\r\nprogrammes or United Nations efforts will produce the\r\ndesired result if due attention is not paid to youth problems\r\nat the national level.\r\nThis was precisely the consideration that guided the\r\nRussian Federation when it adopted the decree on Russia’s\r\npreparations for, and commemoration of, the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year, which provided for\r\nthe formation of an interdepartmental commission and a\r\nplan of action aimed at drawing the attention of leaders at\r\nall levels to youth problems and the need for their solution.\r\nOn the whole, work on youth in Russia is carried out\r\non the basis of a federal programme called Russia’s Youth,\r\nadopted by the Russian Government on 25 February 1994.\r\nThis programme defines not only the role of youth in\r\ncarrying out reforms in our country but also its role in the\r\npresent difficult societal circumstances. Today, young\r\npeople, who account for approximately 40 per cent of the\r\ntotal active population of Russia, are among the first to\r\nexperience the hardships of an economy in transition.\r\nThe purpose of the Russian national programme is\r\nto establish legal, economic and organizational machinery\r\nfor implementing Government youth policies. One of the\r\npriority areas of the work of the Russian Administration\r\nis to establish a legislative and legal basis for Government\r\nyouth policies. In recent years, an entire body of laws has\r\nbeen drawn up and promulgated regarding youth and\r\nchildren. These focus on the working conditions of young\r\npeople, protection of young families, social support of\r\nstudents, measures to establish Government-sponsored\r\nchildren’s and youth recreation facilities, and so on. They\r\ngive particular attention to the prevention of delinquency\r\namong juveniles and minors. For this purpose, an\r\ninterdepartmental task force has been set up; it is\r\ncompleting work on a bill directed at improving\r\nGovernment intervention in this field.\r\nIn the area of combatting the spread of drug abuse\r\namong young people, the Russian Government plans to\r\nadopt, in the very near future, a federal programme\r\ndefining integrated measures to combat drug abuse and\r\nillicit drug trafficking.\r\nAn effective solution to youth problems at the\r\nnational level is impossible without the development of\r\ninternational cooperation. Today, Russia has\r\nintergovernmental agreements on cultural cooperation\r\nwith almost 50 States, on the basis of which youth\r\nactivities are developed. Representatives of Russian youth\r\norganizations participate in seminars and conferences,\r\nsuch as those held under the auspices of the Council of\r\nEurope.\r\nIn the context of cooperation with the United\r\nNations and with its support, an international conference\r\nwas held in Russia this year on “Youth in a transitional\r\nsociety”. In addition, a project is under way involving the\r\ntraining, under United Nations auspices, of Government\r\nofficials dealing with youth problems.\r\nThe Russian delegation would like to underscore that\r\nour country will in future participate actively in the\r\nsolution of youth problems. Russia remains open to any\r\nmutually advantageous cooperation in this field at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Marshall Islands, Ms. Moss.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nMs. Moss (Marshall Islands): Allow me to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral and the other\r\nmembers of the Bureau on their election.\r\nSocial development is a very broad concept, and it has\r\nfar-reaching consequences. In addition, the associated costs\r\ncan be quite crippling, but the benefits that we can reap are\r\nendless. This is an important consideration, which has been\r\ntaken into account in the document prepared by the South\r\nPacific Commission, “Pacific Islands Social and Human\r\nDevelopment”, which my Government fully endorses. This\r\ndocument, which reflects the constraints and realities that\r\nthe small island developing States face, was submitted to\r\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development as\r\na document of the conference.\r\nMy delegation participated actively in that Summit,\r\nand we feel a strong affinity for the draft Programme of\r\nAction. There are concepts in this draft Programme that\r\nform the very basis of social interaction in the Marshall\r\nIslands. I note the strong advocacy for human rights, which,\r\nin our view, could be strengthened even further. These\r\nhuman rights are fundamental and inalienable, and they are\r\nimperative for social development to be successful. As a\r\nmatrilineal society, we are strongly supportive of gender\r\nequality. We also accept the need to have strong democratic\r\ninstitutions, and open government.\r\nThe draft Programme of Action gives due recognition\r\nto the traditional and cultural rights to land, and to the\r\nintricate connection that exists between land and social\r\nnorms in the Marshall Islands. As this same recognition, if\r\nonly in slightly stronger terms, is part of our Constitution,\r\nit would be very difficult for my delegation to have this\r\nreference removed.\r\nAs we stated at the Cairo International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development and the Copenhagen Summit,\r\nthe Marshall Islands has a very high population-growth rate.\r\nThe effect is that the majority of the population is under 15\r\nyears old. This is bound to cause problems for us in the\r\nfuture, since we will need to provide the required social and\r\neconomic opportunities for them. We also have in our\r\npopulation displaced victims of the nuclear-testing\r\nprogramme that was carried out in our islands in the 1940s\r\nand 1950s. Although the victims receive some\r\ncompensation as a result of the testing, those funds are\r\ninsufficient to rehabilitate their lands, provide necessary\r\nmedical care and compensate for the personal injuries that,\r\nto this day, they continue to suffer from.\r\nThe key issue for the Marshall Islands is whether or\r\nnot there will be any assistance from outside sources for\r\nthe programmes of action of Cairo, Copenhagen and\r\nBeijing. We would dearly love to see all their provisions\r\nimplemented in the Marshall Islands, but the fact remains\r\nthat we simply do not have the funding to do these things\r\nby ourselves. I must therefore appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to look favourably on the Marshall Islands. In\r\nparticular, I would ask the non-governmental\r\norganizations to commit themselves to helping us in\r\nfulfilling these commitments that we are undertaking. The\r\nsheer scale of undertaking social development is\r\nextremely difficult for us, since we simply do not have\r\nthe strength or the resources to completely provide for the\r\ndevelopment needs of our people. Currently, our\r\nexpenditures on the social sector outstrip any of our other\r\nbudgetary expenses. We are therefore very interested in\r\nthe 20/20 concept endorsed at the Copenhagen Summit.\r\nThe urban migration and high population growth in\r\nthe Marshall Islands that I have alluded to are quite a\r\nchallenge for my Government. Young people who come\r\nto the urban centres looking for jobs — jobs that are\r\noften hard to come by — are creating a major concern for\r\nus. Unemployment often leads to idleness and\r\ndelinquency. It becomes a breeding ground for alcoholism\r\nand the scourge of drugs. The extended family structure\r\nthat would nurture, protect and give guidance to the\r\nindividual in rural areas is broken down in the urban\r\ncentres and, as a result, there is a distinct rise in the loss\r\nof traditional values and respect. However, my\r\nGovernment is consolidating efforts with various cultural\r\norganizations, as we try to bring in greater knowledge of\r\nhistory and pride in the culture of the Marshall Islands.\r\nThis culture has at its basis respect for elders and for the\r\ncommunity, and mutual respect among individuals. It will\r\ntherefore revitalize the guidance that the breakdown of the\r\nfamily can destroy.\r\nThe Marshall Islands has therefore instituted a youth\r\npolicy to educate and socialize our young people from an\r\nearly stage, to make them feel part of the larger\r\ncommunity, and to be active participants in the\r\ndevelopment of society. Earlier this year our communities\r\nlaunched Pacific Youth Week, which covered areas such\r\nas population education, family planning and suicide, and\r\nincluded youth representatives from at least 10 youth\r\ngroups. Furthermore, as a State party to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child, we have recently enacted\r\nlegislation that will strengthen our commitments under\r\nthat Convention.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nBasic education is mandated under our Constitution.\r\nWe have therefore prepared a Ten Year Education Plan, a\r\npolicy which aims to encourage community-based\r\neducation. We are building more schools in the rural areas\r\nto reduce the trend of the urban migration for those seeking\r\neducation. Moreover, secondary education is now\r\ncompulsory, and our plan also encourages the youth of our\r\ncountry to get themselves a higher education. Our\r\nscholarship program provides assistance for those young\r\npeople who wish to continue on to higher education. We\r\nare cooperating with the grass-roots and community-based\r\norganizations, like the churches and the youth organizations,\r\nto address these matters in a comprehensive manner.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nMy Government is further required under our\r\nConstitution to provide basic health care; thus we have\r\ninstituted a comprehensive health insurance scheme. It\r\ncovers all citizens, and contributions are shared by the\r\nGovernment and those who are employed. During April of\r\nthis year we celebrated National Health Month, in which\r\nwe made efforts to promote the importance of local food\r\nfor health. The focus on local food was largely aimed at the\r\ngrowing deficiency of Vitamin A in Marshallese children.\r\nBecause of this growing health concern, our Ministries of\r\nHealth, Education, Social Services, Internal Affairs and\r\nResearch and Development distributed Vitamin A pills to\r\nover 6,000 children. Since we recognize that Vitamin A\r\ndistribution is only a short-term solution, health promotion\r\neducation was a major focus of the campaign.\r\nMy Government has made a conscious effort to reduce\r\npublic sector employment, which accounts for 70 per cent\r\nof the annual budget. We are thus encouraging private\r\nsector development with incentives, and privatizing some\r\npublic services. In addition to freeing up resources for\r\nexpenditures in social development, we are cutting costs,\r\nimproving efficiency and encouraging participation by the\r\ncitizens. An example is the newly established National\r\nTraining Council, which will provide technical and\r\nvocational training to young school leavers, as an\r\nalternative to other studies. We are also hopeful that the\r\nCouncil can institute some on-the-job training. By building\r\nour economy through private and local endeavours, we can\r\nbetter control our future development.\r\nWe are currently studying the report of the 1995\r\nWorld Youth Leaders Conference and find that universally,\r\nthe development process is facilitated through encouraging\r\neducation and community participation by our young\r\ncitizens. Therefore, we feel that it is important now, more\r\nthan ever, that we invest greatly in our youth, because it\r\nis the international youth of the present who can most\r\neffectively contribute to positive and sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the future. My Government will continue\r\nto plan and implement programmes focused on youth\r\nparticipation and education, and we will continue to seek\r\noutside resources to aid us in the successful outcome of\r\nour social development programs. In this regard, we will\r\nwork with other interested delegations in drafting a\r\nconstructive resolution to help us achieve our goals in\r\nsocial development.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Burkina Faso Mr. Ablassé Ouédraogo.\r\nMr. Ouédraogo (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): First of all, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Burkina Faso, I wish to offer our sincere\r\ncondolences to the delegation of Ghana, to the bereaved\r\nfamily, and to the people of Ghana. We have lost a true\r\nson of Ghana and of Africa: Kenneth Dadzie. His life was\r\ndevoted to the service of the rehabilitation of Africa and\r\nto ensuring the implementation of the lofty goals of the\r\nUnited Nations. May he rest in peace. We hope that his\r\nexample will be a fertile and beneficial model for us and\r\nfor future generations.\r\nFifty years after the establishment of the United\r\nNations, we are marking the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year. Indeed, 1985 witnessed the\r\nadoption of the guidelines for further planning and\r\nsuitable follow-up in the field of youth. Since then,\r\nnumerous problems and blights have beset youth.\r\nSimultaneously, during the last five years, the United\r\nNations has sought to ensure that the youth and its\r\nspecific needs become recognized in the plans and\r\nprogrammes for action elaborated on at the following\r\nglobal forums: in New York for the child, Rio for the\r\nenvironment, Vienna for human rights, Cairo for\r\npopulation, Copenhagen for social development and\r\nBeijing for women.\r\nWe must consider as a sign of the times the nature\r\nof the concern for youth. In the past, this exalted us and\r\nmade us inevitably conclude that youth was the promise\r\nof a radiant future and progress. Today, in the wake of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nvarious ills that affect young people, we are divided\r\nbetween hope and anxiety. The malfunctioning of our\r\nsocieties, conflicts, unemployment, illiteracy, poverty, drug\r\nabuse, AIDS, and crime are among the main afflictions of\r\nyouth.\r\nIn resolution 47/85 of 16 December 1992, the General\r\nAssembly set out policies and measures necessary for\r\naddressing and resolving youth problems. A world\r\nprogramme of action was put to Member States, with a\r\nview to arriving at a common denominator for action and\r\nassessment to the year 2000 and beyond.\r\nIt is clear that what we here hope, what we seek for\r\nand with youth, is that the cultural and social diversity of\r\nyoung people must be taken into account, together with the\r\nparticularly difficult situations they sometimes experience.\r\nYoung people in difficulty constitute the most vulnerable\r\nelements of a social category that is already vulnerable.\r\nBurkina Faso, for its part, has acted and responded at\r\ntwo levels — national and international. It has acted in four\r\nareas: those of education, health, the environment and\r\ncombatting unemployment. At the national level, and more\r\nspecifically in terms of organizational measures, Burkina\r\nFaso has established within the Ministry for Youth and\r\nSports an office on youth, in which action for young people\r\nis indexed, coordinated and stimulated through the\r\ninvolvement of all youth movements and through the\r\norganization of seminars on problems affecting youth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the field of education, Burkina Faso has developed\r\na policy to teach human rights and the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Constitution of Burkina Faso in schools,\r\nin centres of professional training and in centres providing\r\nfunctional literacy. The Government has also sought to\r\nreduce disparities between boys and girls by facilitating,\r\nand even by giving priority access to the latter to\r\neducational institutions, particularly primary institutions. In\r\nthat area, in order to extend the scope of application to all\r\nforms of education and training, the Government of Burkina\r\nFaso has also organized a seminar for the mobilization of\r\nresources for the implementation of the national plan for\r\nthe education of girls.\r\nIn the field of health and the environment, we have\r\ndevised and implemented information and education\r\nprogrammes including seminars and lectures on sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases and environmental preservation.\r\nReforestation camps for young people have been organized.\r\nThe National Commission on Drug Control and the\r\nMinistry on Territorial Administration are working\r\nactively to promote awareness and to mobilize efforts\r\nagainst drug abuse and narcotics trafficking, as well as in\r\nthe area of juvenile delinquency and rehabilitation of\r\ndelinquents into society, with the support of the Ministry\r\nfor Social Action and the Family. Ours is a policy both of\r\nprevention and of cure, in the light of the moral and\r\nmaterial damage that psychotropic substances have done\r\nelsewhere and of the potential dangers in our own\r\ncountry. The social fabric is irrevocably affected; the\r\nmoral fabric is torn; and the future of youth is stymied in\r\nan impasse.\r\nIn the area of combatting unemployment, the\r\nGovernment of Burkina Faso has undertaken a review of\r\nthe labour code in order to identify ways and means of\r\nstimulating new enterprises, the creation of jobs, the\r\nexecution of support projects for the integration of young\r\npeople in the field of stock-breeding and agriculture.\r\nIn that context, irrigated lands in the Province of\r\nSourou have been entrusted to young unemployed\r\ngraduates. They have been provided with agricultural\r\nequipment and paid a wage to work these areas.\r\nMoreover, a support fund for the informal sector was set\r\nup, as was a fund to support money-earning activities\r\namong women.\r\nAt the international level, the young people of\r\nBurkina Faso, inter alia, in addition to the solidarity\r\nshown with the youth of South Africa and the entire\r\nworld, took part in the \"Youth 21\" forum in Côte d’Ivoire\r\nand are preparing for the Pan-African Youth Conference\r\nto be held in Ethiopia on the theme of \"Participation,\r\nDevelopment and Peace\" — the same theme as\r\nInternational Youth Year.\r\nPursuant to General Assembly resolution 47/85,\r\nnational meetings on youth are scheduled in Burkina Faso\r\nto draw up and implement a national programme of action\r\nthrough which we intend to involve young people to a\r\ngreater extent in the country’s socio-economic and\r\ncultural development process.\r\nThis has been a brief and partial overview of what\r\nmy country has done since the adoption in 1985 of the\r\nguidelines for youth. However, before I conclude, I\r\nshould like to express Burkina Faso’s support for the\r\ndesignation of a World Youth Day during which each\r\nState would take stock of progress and identify and\r\nfollow up on ways and means to implement what remains\r\nto be done. Young people, together with their elders, will\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nbe the main actors in determining their future and be given\r\nresponsibility for it.\r\nBurkina Faso attaches particular importance to the\r\nfollow-up to the draft World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth and feels that the United Nations department\r\nresponsible for social development should be strengthened\r\nby the establishment of a youth division which, in turn,\r\nwould work with the Commission for Social Development\r\non the follow-up to the draft Programme of Action.\r\nMost important of all, the young people of Burkina\r\nFaso, in the same way as young people throughout the\r\nworld, in a spirit of mutual respect, should be aware that\r\nthey are part of one and the same youth, rich in diversity\r\nand strong in vitality in the face of all the pitfalls.\r\nProblems of frontiers, living conditions, and economic\r\nand social inequalities generated by the current world\r\neconomic order are slowing down this momentum and\r\ncloud the vision of a world that is one and many at the\r\nsame time, diverse and unique, friendly and fraternal. Our\r\nardent wish is that young people, despite everything, in\r\nthe face of and regardless of everything, will right the\r\nwrongs in the world and advance irresistibly towards a\r\nworld of brotherhood, justice and peace.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker for\r\nthis meeting devoted to marking the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year. Before adjourning the meeting,\r\nI should like to invite delegates to remain seated as\r\nimmediately following the adjournment of this meeting,\r\nI shall have the honour to preside over a special briefing.\r\nAt the briefing, delegations will hear representatives from\r\nseveral youth non-governmental organizations speak of\r\ntheir activities in support of the United Nations Youth\r\nProgramme.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.15 p.m.\r\n16\r\n"
