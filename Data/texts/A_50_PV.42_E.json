(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of Judge Andrés Aguilar\r\nMawdsley, member of the International Court of Justice\r\nThe President: Before we take up the item on our\r\nagenda for this afternoon, I must with deep regret inform\r\nthe General Assembly that Judge Andrés Aguilar\r\nMawdsley, a member of the International Court of Justice,\r\npassed away on 24 October 1995.\r\nJudge Aguilar Mawdsley, a distinguished diplomat and\r\njurist, had a long and close association with the United\r\nNations. He had served as Chairman of several Main\r\nCommittees of the General Assembly, as Permanent\r\nRepresentative of his country to the United Nations, as\r\nPresident of the Security Council and as Head of the\r\ndelegation of Venezuela to a number of major United\r\nNations conferences, notably the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Law of the Sea. Judge Aguilar\r\nMawdsley had been a member of the International Law\r\nCommission since 1979 and a member of the Court since\r\n6 February 1991.\r\nIn his long and distinguished career, he made\r\nimportant contributions in various fields, in particular in the\r\nfields of diplomacy and international law.\r\nI am sure that I interpret the sentiments of the General\r\nAssembly in expressing its condolences to the President of\r\nthe Court and his colleagues. I would also like to ask the\r\ndelegation of Venezuela to accept, and to transmit to the\r\nGovernment of Venezuela and Judge Andrés Aguilar\r\nMawdsley’s bereaved family, our expression of sympathy\r\nat this sad loss.\r\nI invite the General Assembly to stand for one\r\nminute in silent tribute to the memory of Judge Andrés\r\nAguilar Mawdsley.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. De Rosas (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\ndelegation of Venezuela would like to say how grateful\r\nwe are for the very kind and generous words that you,\r\nSir, have just spoken about Judge Aguilar on his passing\r\naway yesterday. Be assured that we will convey them to\r\nour Government and to Judge Aguilar’s family.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention of\r\nthe General Assembly to document A/INF/50/5/Add.1,\r\nwhich contains a tentative programme of work and\r\nschedule of plenary meetings for the rest of October and\r\nthe month of November. This addendum supersedes\r\ndocument A/INF/50/5 and the announcement I made on\r\n12 October. This schedule is being issued to assist\r\ndelegations in planning their work. For its part, the\r\nSecretariat will endeavour to ensure that the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\ndocumentation is available to delegations in advance of the\r\ndiscussion of any given agenda item.\r\nI should further point out that there are still a few\r\nagenda items for which no date has been indicated. I will\r\nannounce the dates for the consideration of those items in\r\ndue course and sufficiently in advance. I will also keep the\r\nAssembly informed of any additions or changes.\r\nI should like to inform Members that agenda item 28,\r\nentitled “The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina”, will not\r\nbe taken up on the morning of Tuesday, 31 October, as\r\nscheduled. The item will be considered at a later date to be\r\nannounced.\r\nThe list of speakers for each of the items listed in\r\ndocument A/INF/50/5/Add.1 is now open.\r\nAs I mentioned to the Assembly in my earlier\r\nannouncement, I hope to keep close to this schedule so that\r\nthe Assembly can discharge its responsibilities as\r\neffectively and expeditiously as possible. I again appeal to\r\nthose representatives submitting draft resolutions to do so\r\nsufficiently in advance of the dates fixed for consideration\r\nof items to give members adequate time to examine them.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that\r\nadditional time is needed for draft resolutions involving\r\nchanges in the work programme or additional expenditures\r\nsince they will require the preparation of a statement of\r\nprogramme budget implications by the Secretary-General.\r\nFurthermore, the Advisory Committee on Administrative\r\nand Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee will need\r\nadequate time to review the programme budget implications\r\nof a draft resolution before it can be acted on by the\r\nAssembly.\r\nWhile on the subject of draft resolutions, I should like\r\nto inform members that in view of the number of draft\r\nresolutions expected under agenda item 20, entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including\r\nspecial economic assistance”, and the possible need to hold\r\nconsultations on them with a view to reaching consensus,\r\nthe deadline for the submission of draft resolutions under\r\nagenda item 20 will be Friday, 10 November 1995.\r\nLast but not least, I should like to ask delegations to\r\ncontinue to keep in mind the limitation of Secretariat\r\nservices, resulting from the financial crisis facing the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAgenda item 105 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nCommemoration to mark the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year\r\nThe President: This afternoon, the General\r\nAssembly will hold the second of the plenary meetings to\r\nmark the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year\r\nand to consider, with a view to adopting it, the draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000\r\nand Beyond.\r\nI now call on the representative of Norway,\r\nMs. Ingrid Nordbø, Youth Representative.\r\nMs. Nordbø (Norway): As a youth representative of\r\nNorway to the General Assembly it is a great honour and\r\na pleasure for me to focus on youth and global youth\r\npolicy in a plenary meeting of the Assembly.\r\nLet me at the outset express my appreciation of the\r\nfact that the fiftieth session of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is also the tenth anniversary of the International\r\nYouth Year, has focused on a draft World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond. We\r\nregret that there has been no consensus on the draft text.\r\nWe hope, nevertheless, that Governments will use the\r\ndraft Programme as a guideline for further development\r\nof national youth policy.\r\nYouth is a part of the population with specific needs\r\nand potentials. Young people are not solely human beings\r\npassively waiting to enter adulthood; nor are we a more\r\ndemanding and troublesome version of the child. Youth\r\nis a stage marked by strong sentiments and values. It is a\r\nperiod of life characterized by enthusiastic energy\r\ncombined with a critical view of the established structures\r\nof society.\r\nThe youth of today is experiencing a rapidly\r\nchanging world. Some aspects of the global development\r\nare not causing positive effects. Our vulnerable\r\nenvironment is suffering from pollution, and devastating\r\nwars are going on in several parts of the world. Recent\r\ndecades have increased our consciousness that the Earth\r\nis fragile. It is more crucial than ever that it be populated\r\nby responsible and concerned people, ready to unite their\r\nefforts in finding global solutions. In order to strengthen\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nthis feeling of responsibility and concern, youth must be\r\ngiven the opportunity actively to take part in the shaping of\r\nsociety. We must be given a fair opportunity to influence\r\ndecision-making at all levels. The fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly has discussed the draft World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond. The United Nations has recognized the need for a\r\nglobal youth policy. I hope that this will lead to a greater\r\nawareness of the specific needs of youth, not only in the\r\nGovernments here present, but also in the various United\r\nNations agencies which are working with youth in the field\r\naround the world.\r\nI would like to draw attention specifically to one of\r\nthe priority areas mentioned in section IV J of the draft\r\nProgramme, entitled “Full and effective participation of\r\nyouth in the life of society and in decision-making”. The\r\nProgramme stresses the importance of enabling youth to\r\nparticipate actively in order to be integrated into and to\r\ninfluence the society they are, and will be, living in. It is\r\nimportant that youth at an early stage be able to use their\r\nresources and energy in constructive contribution to the\r\ndecision-making processes, and not give up because of the\r\noverwhelming challenges the world is facing. A feeling of\r\nresignation amongst youth must be prevented. The\r\nsuccessful implementation of the important results of the\r\nRio, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing Conferences needs the\r\nactive support of all generations.\r\nYouth organizations should be recognized as schools\r\nof democracy. Through active participation, young people\r\nwill gain experience in how democracy works. Recognizing\r\nyouth organizations as important arenas for developing\r\nskills necessary for efficient participation in society,\r\nGovernments should facilitate their existence by respecting\r\nfull freedom of association, and should contribute with\r\nfinancial, moral and organizational support.\r\nIn Vienna four years ago, a global youth forum\r\nbrought together 150 representatives of national, regional\r\nand international youth non-governmental organizations and\r\nagencies of the United Nations system. In 1996 another\r\nUnited Nations youth forum is scheduled. The United\r\nNations system should provide financial resources to ensure\r\nthat the event can take place. The Organization should\r\nencourage Governments to include youth representatives in\r\ntheir national delegations to the General Assembly and\r\nother United Nations events. This will give youth an\r\nopportunity to influence and share their ideas and\r\nperspectives with decision-makers within the United\r\nNations system. Further, it is a valuable experience that\r\nthese representatives will make use of in their work with\r\nyouth issues in their home countries. Very few countries\r\npractice this today on a regular basis, although the\r\nexperiences of those countries that have youth\r\nrepresentatives are positive. The General Assembly has\r\nalready invited Governments to include youth\r\nrepresentatives whenever possible in their national\r\ndelegations. I will remind all Member States of their\r\nresponsibility to implement this resolution.\r\nIt is my sincere hope, that the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year will not be reduced to a\r\ncommemoration of the past, but that the opportunity will\r\nbe used to look forward, and to identify the challenges\r\nand potentials of the future.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nthe Philippines, Mrs. Amina Rasul-Bernardo, Presidential\r\nAdviser on Youth Affairs and Chairperson of the\r\nPhilippines National Youth Commission.\r\nMrs. Rasul-Bernardo (Philippines): We celebrate\r\nthis year the half-century of existence of an instrument for\r\npeace, an institution that was forged in the foundry of\r\nhuman tragedy. It is a celebration that is deserved, for the\r\nfolly and the risk of a conflagration of the magnitude of\r\nthe last two global wars have been averted.\r\nThe United Nations has done more than this. Not\r\nonly have fewer young men and women died needlessly\r\nin battle, but the co-responsibility of nations in a global\r\ncommunity has meant that proportionately fewer have\r\ndied from communicable diseases. Proportionately fewer\r\nhave suffered from the blindness of illiteracy.\r\nProportionately fewer have died from hunger and poverty.\r\nProportionately fewer, yes — but in absolute\r\nnumbers, more.\r\nThe United Nations declared 1985 as International\r\nYouth Year in recognition of the difficulties faced by the\r\nyoung owing to the lack of adequate opportunities for\r\neducation and training, unemployment, juvenile\r\ndelinquency, drug abuse, poor health facilities and\r\nservices and lack of participation in the life of society and\r\ndecision making, among other things.\r\nToday, the world’s youth, numbering over a billion\r\npeople, still cry out for the opportunities to be provided\r\nto them, that they may fulfil their rightful roles in society\r\nas partners in the development of their nations. Of\r\nparticular concern to the international community is the\r\nplight of vulnerable and disadvantaged youth — those in\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nareas of conflict, in foreign-occupied or alien-dominated\r\nterritories, refugee and displaced youth, indigenous youth\r\nand those with disabilities; the girl-child.\r\nThe populations of the developing countries are\r\nbecoming younger, while those of the mature economies are\r\nageing rapidly. This reverse demographic trend implies a\r\nnumber of things. One effect will be increased youth\r\nmigration from the developing to the developed societies in\r\nsearch of opportunities as well as in response to these\r\nsocieties’ need for younger blood to fuel their economies.\r\nThere will also be pressure for equitable access to the\r\nworld’s resources and services and the upgrading, if you\r\nwill, of the structures and mechanisms for development\r\nworldwide.\r\nA global response that will open up greater\r\nopportunities for youth in the developing nations is\r\nindispensable — not only because this is the morally\r\ncorrect thing to do, but also because it will be ultimately\r\nbeneficial to the whole human community that it be done.\r\nThe other day, our Heads of State and Government\r\nadopted a Declaration on the fiftieth anniversary of this\r\nOrganization. They expressed their resolve to redirect the\r\nUnited Nations to the greater service of humankind,\r\nespecially to those who are suffering and are deeply\r\ndeprived. This is the practical and moral challenge of our\r\ntime. In the words of the Secretary-General, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary should provide the occasion to “rekindle the\r\nideals of the Charter”, and for the United Nations to reach\r\nout to a wider, more global audience, especially young\r\npeople. In this way, the United Nations will be both\r\nstrengthened and renewed.\r\nIt is with these considerations that we in the group of\r\n77 and China welcome the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond. This is the\r\nlogical step to take after the Conferences of Rio, Cairo,\r\nCopenhagen and Beijing. We laud the Beijing Platform of\r\nAction for its focus on the girl-child.\r\nWe hope that all countries will work conscientiously\r\ntowards the achievement of the goals of the youth\r\nprogramme. It is imperative that the international\r\ncommunity support the programme with a generous\r\ncommitment to the shared responsibilities implied by this\r\ndocument.\r\nThe Philippine Government has been sensitive to the\r\nrequirements of our youth. First, the Constitution of our\r\nRepublic clearly enunciates the responsibilities of\r\nGovernment. Thus, it provides that\r\n“the State recognizes the vital role of youth in\r\nnation-building and ... shall encourage their\r\ninvolvement in public and civic affairs”.\r\nSecondly, our Constitution explicitly directs the\r\nGovernment to allocate the largest share of the national\r\nbudget to education.\r\nThirdly, we have closely involved the young in the\r\ninstitutions of local governance. This is a unique element\r\nin the deepening of our democratic culture. We have\r\nempowered our youth at every level of local governance.\r\nBeginning from the village council, or “barangay”, we\r\nhave organized youth councils composed of elected\r\nrepresentatives aged 15 to 21 — unique among Member\r\ncountries of the United Nations.\r\nFourthly, we have appointed youth sectoral\r\nrepresentatives to our Congress to ensure their full\r\nparticipation in the country’s law-making process.\r\nFifthly, the Philippines has created the National\r\nYouth Commission to coordinate all youth-related\r\ninstitutions, policies, programmes and activities of\r\nGovernment and to ensure participation in national\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSixthly, the Philippines has adopted a national youth\r\ndevelopment programme that ensures priority attention to\r\nthe needs and the concerns of young people.\r\nIn all these initiatives since 1985, Government has\r\nendeavoured to strengthen the development of a value\r\nsystem anchored in the sanctity of family life,\r\ncompassion, civility, respect for others and a responsible\r\nbalance between material affluence and cultural and\r\nspiritual enhancement.\r\nThe Philippines looks forward to the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action on Youth as a larger framework\r\nwithin which we could situate our own initiatives on\r\nyouth development. Within that framework, broader\r\ninternational cooperation on youth concerns becomes\r\nmore feasible. We look forward to orchestrated global\r\naction to create a human community where our young\r\nwill no longer be exposed to the needless trials of the\r\nflesh and the spirit, but will grow to assume responsible\r\nstewardship of our societies and the environment.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nWe take this opportunity to draw the international\r\ncommunity’s attention once again to the plight of migrant\r\nworkers, many of whom are young and are becoming\r\nincreasingly younger. The youth of this diaspora are\r\nparticularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. We\r\ntherefore urge all countries to speedily ratify the United\r\nNations Convention on Migrant Workers and Members of\r\nTheir Families. We also believe that it is high time that a\r\nglobal conference on migration and development was\r\nconvened to address this global phenomenon.\r\nAt this juncture, the Philippines invites all countries to\r\nparticipate in the upcoming global indigenous and youth\r\ncultural olympics, which will be held in Manila from 24\r\nFebruary to 3 March 1996. This project flows from the\r\nsuccessful 1993 global youth earth-saving summit held in\r\nthe Philippines, which developed partnership between\r\nindigenous communities and youth for sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur own national hero, Jose P. Rizal, who was\r\nmartyred very young, wrote “the youth is the hope of the\r\nmotherland.” All Governments recognize this to be true.\r\nAnd yet, youth continues to be marginalized, and in many\r\nareas exploited and abused.\r\nAll States have a responsibility to mobilize youth’s\r\nabilities, to sharpen their creativity and inventive genius and\r\nto redirect their enthusiasm and hope for the freedom of all\r\npeoples from fear, hunger, and injustice. However, it is now\r\nan issue with a global dimension, and thus requires a global\r\nresponse.\r\nIt has been a decade since the Declaration of the\r\nInternational Youth Year. Yet the problems of youth\r\nremain, and are possibly increasing. Worse, access to\r\nopportunities and basic services remains as problematic as\r\never.\r\nWe who represent the aspirations of the youth of the\r\nworld call for the approval of the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth. We call on the\r\ninternational community to provide the necessary resources\r\nto implement programmes addressing the needs of the\r\nyouth of the world.\r\nA young Filipino martyr in the dark days of martial\r\nlaw in the Philippines, one of many who helped break the\r\nchain of dictatorship, asked:\r\n“If we do not care, who will care? If we do not act,\r\nwho will act? If not now, when?”\r\nI ask the same question today: if not now, when?\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nBarbados, The Honourable Mia Amor Mottley, Minister\r\nof Education, Youth Affairs and Culture.\r\nMs. Mottley (Barbados): First of all, let me express\r\nthe sadness of the Barbados Government at the passing of\r\nMr. Kenneth Dadzie, who for almost four decades\r\ndistinguished himself in public service, both for the\r\nUnited Nations and for his own country, Ghana.\r\nIt is an honour for me to address the General\r\nAssembly at a time when world attention is focused on\r\nthe significant contribution this body has made over the\r\npast 50 years. Let me convey to the United Nations the\r\ngreetings of the Government and the people of Barbados,\r\nas well as congratulations on the attainment of its golden\r\nmilestone. Fifty years in the cause of world peace has\r\noften seemed an elusive and formidable goal, yet as we\r\napproach the end of this millennium, a renewed hope stirs\r\nour imagination and challenges us to bring into being a\r\nnew world order based on tolerance, mutual respect and\r\ngood will.\r\nIt is with young people that this challenge must\r\nsquarely rest, for they will help to shape the structure of\r\nthat new world order. We live in a world where economic\r\ngains are often realized at a tremendous cost to the poor,\r\nthe marginalized and the socially deprived. Our young\r\npeople represent our hope for the future, yet public policy\r\noften mortgages their future, laying tremendous tax\r\nburdens, environmental stress and social fragmentation on\r\ntheir shoulders. The famous African-American poet\r\nGwendolyn Brooks asked in her poem “The Children of\r\nthe Poor”,\r\n“What shall I give my children who are poor; who\r\nare adjudged the leastwise of the land, who are my\r\nsweetest lepers; who demand no velvet and no\r\nvelvety velour ...?”\r\nAs we turn our attention to such questions during our\r\nobservance of the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\nYear, perhaps we may find the answers that bring hope.\r\nThe intervening decade has witnessed mind-boggling\r\nchanges, ranging from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and\r\nthe end of communism in Europe to expanded markets\r\nand the emergence of major trade blocs, which sometimes\r\nthreatens the economic viability of small island\r\ndeveloping States. In spite of this activity, many young\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\npeople remain spectators at a play whose denouement\r\ncontinues to be a mystery. Can we blame them if they\r\nremain cynical and adopt an existential stance towards their\r\nexistence?\r\nA young French mathematician and philosopher by the\r\nname of Blaise Pascal summed up this mood best over 300\r\nyears ago, when he said,\r\n“when I consider the short duration of my life,\r\nswallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little\r\nspace I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite\r\nimmensity of space of which I am ignorant and which\r\nknows me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at\r\nbeing here rather than there; why now rather than\r\nthen?”\r\nThis echoes the comments of the speaker who preceded me,\r\nthe Chairperson of the National Youth Commission of the\r\nGovernment of the Philippines.\r\nOur task must be to steer our young people away from\r\nthe nothingness of this void. It is therefore fitting and\r\ntimely that the World Programme of Action for Youth to\r\nthe year 2000 contains measures which, if implemented by\r\nGovernments, should redound to the benefit of young\r\npeople everywhere. The Programme focuses on providing\r\nnew opportunities for young people, integrating youth-\r\nrelated concerns and national development policies and\r\nplans, protecting young people from harmful drugs and\r\naddictive substances, fostering racial and religious tolerance,\r\nmutual respect and understanding among young people and,\r\nmost important of all, dealing with the question of\r\nemployment opportunities for young people.\r\nThe Government of Barbados, like those of other\r\nMember States, subscribes to these principles and has\r\nendorsed them in its national youth policies. Barbados also\r\nrecognizes that if young people are to participate fully in\r\nthe socio-economic life of our society, they must be given\r\nopportunities for educational attainment commensurate with\r\ntheir aspirations. Hence our belief in ensuring that children\r\nat the primary and secondary levels have 100 per cent\r\naccess. They must also be allowed access to employment\r\nopportunities, or self-employment, and training must be\r\nprovided, whether in particular skills or in business\r\nopportunities.\r\nMany States Members of the United Nations are newly\r\nindependent countries, having gained independence in the\r\nlast 30 years. The challenge for the former colonies is to\r\nforge a path that is culturally relevant and developmentally\r\nsustainable and to place strong emphasis on that cadre of\r\nyoung people who hold the key to national identity and\r\nprosperity. Young people demand change. We must be\r\nthe architects and craftsmen of that change.\r\nI therefore welcome the themes identified some 10\r\nyears ago by the General Assembly for International\r\nYouth Year: participation, development and peace. Today\r\nthey will serve as a worthwhile model for integrated\r\naction at all levels. This should serve to address more\r\neffectively the problems experienced by young people in\r\nsociety. I therefore applaud the broad and diverse inputs\r\nfrom other international instruments into the Programme\r\nof Action.\r\nThe Government of Barbados realizes that the\r\nchallenge of meeting these themes can be met only\r\nthrough a scientific and participatory approach to youth\r\npolicy and youth development: scientific, because\r\nresources are scarce and we must therefore maximize the\r\nbenefits to be gained from our programmes and not\r\nsimply shoot into the air; and participatory, because that\r\nis the only way we can reach the young people.\r\nFor young people, Governments are often faceless\r\nbureaucracies producing many words and little action that\r\nhas a direct impact on them. We in Barbados believe that\r\nif we are to succeed in reaching those people who are\r\nmarginalized, we must first put a face on government. As\r\none of our primary programmes, we have therefore\r\nidentified a system of appointing a number of Youth\r\nCommissioners responsible for motivating, counselling,\r\nmobilizing and channelling 80,000 young people at the\r\nground level into programmes already provided by\r\ngovernment in all areas of social and economic activity.\r\nThey are the eyes, ears, hands and feet of government,\r\nbecause at the end of the day we must be able to say to\r\nthose young people that here is someone whom you can\r\ntrust and on whom you can rely.\r\nIn addition, there is a Youth Entrepreneurship\r\nprogramme directed at young people who want to pursue\r\nself-employment and entrepreneurial activity. Through this\r\nprogramme, we are now offering technical and financial\r\nassistance and are developing a mentor programme that\r\nwill give those young people the opportunity to consult\r\nclosely and work with established business persons in the\r\nprivate sector. The ultimate objective of this programme\r\nis to create confidence among young entrepreneurs,\r\nbecause if they fail they will not return to the life of\r\nbusiness.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nThe Barbados Youth Service represents yet another\r\nattempt to reach those young people by providing a\r\nframework of character building and discipline while still\r\nproviding skills to encourage their personal development\r\nand growth. These youth programmes are buttressed by\r\nextensive training programmes in the formal and\r\nnon-formal education sector and, indeed, through interaction\r\nwith other social service agencies. Such programmes, we\r\nbelieve, provide for the rekindling of hope, the building of\r\ntrust and the development of confidence among young\r\npeople. At the end of the day, if you do not talk to them\r\nand relate to them in a language and a style that they\r\nunderstand, they will remain outcasts in their own country.\r\nWe believe that no single programme will ever\r\nsucceed in meeting this challenge fully. Our responsibility\r\nas Governments therefore must be to create an environment\r\nin which both governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations can create a safety net that is wide enough to\r\ncatch the diverse needs and interests of young people.\r\nAs difficult as the battle is for Governments, I daresay\r\nthat the real struggle lies within that individual young man\r\nor young woman. Let the words of a beloved young\r\nBarbadian artist, Edwin Yearwood, who is an icon for\r\nyoung Caribbean people, stand as an inspiration to each one\r\nof those young persons:\r\n“A voice in my head keeps telling me the road is long\r\nIt tells me we must be strong,\r\nIt tells me we must go on.\r\nToday is the start of the rest of my life”.\r\nThis time, perhaps, we will all hear that voice.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nLatvia, Ms. Linda Jā kobsone, Youth Representative.\r\nMs. Jā kobsone (Latvia): As this is the first time that\r\na youth representative from Latvia has addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I should like to express my appreciation\r\nfor this honour, especially on such an occasion as the\r\nspecial commemorative meeting to mark the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year. Following the\r\nadoption at the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly\r\nof resolutions 49/152 and 49/154, the Latvian Government\r\ndecided to include a youth representative in its official\r\ndelegation to this session of the General Assembly. It is a\r\ngreat honour and pleasure for me to represent Latvia here.\r\nI should like to address the General Assembly on a\r\ntopic that is quite timely for the United Nations: tolerance.\r\nThis is the United Nations Year for Tolerance. Tolerance\r\nis something that we all need in our everyday lives,\r\nsomething that makes our personalities free and allows us\r\nto be independent in our understanding of the world. In\r\nthis context, I should like to address the issue of tolerance\r\nfrom the perspective of youth.\r\nI am 19 years old. This means that I am no longer\r\na child. I am no longer a schoolgirl who plays with her\r\ndolls in the playground. I am old enough to make\r\ndecisions on my own: vote, get married, travel on my\r\nown. I am responsible for myself, but not for the things\r\nthat are happening all around the world. However, there\r\nare things I can influence to make my life, and other\r\npeople’s lives, better.\r\nBut what do we understand by the word “better”?\r\nFor each person, it has a different meaning, based on our\r\nindividual values rather than on our colour, age, gender,\r\nreligion, language, culture or nationality. Tolerance begins\r\nby listening to different opinions and by trying to\r\nunderstand where they come from.\r\nThere is a popular drawing that depicts children\r\nholding hands around the globe. It shows that children do\r\nnot see the differences in colour, gender or nationality,\r\nbut accept everyone. The differences begin to grow only\r\nas children become older. We should learn a lesson from\r\nthe very young and treat other persons as individuals first,\r\nleaving their superficial differences in second place. We\r\nhave to treat the world in which we live as the best, and\r\nonly, world we have. We should try to unite the world,\r\nnot drive it apart. We have to accept that there is enough\r\nspace in the world for everybody, and that there will\r\ncontinue to be, if we stand for peace — peace between\r\nnature and human beings, among nations, countries,\r\npeoples, neighbours, relatives and families. Peace can be\r\nreached only through tolerance. But who is thinking of\r\ntolerance now, and who will bring it to the world? I think\r\nthat we cannot wait for future generations to bring peace;\r\nwe have to act now.\r\nThe future belongs to youth. The young have always\r\nhad the task of breaking with the old and bringing in new\r\nways. While this has not always worked, we should at\r\nleast try. Youth are the next politicians, business people,\r\nparents, teachers, scientists, writers and presidents. They\r\nwill determine the course of the years to come. Those of\r\nus who are still quite young are already thinking about\r\nwhat sort of world we are going to live in, have our\r\nfamilies in, bring up our children in.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nThe world is getting more complicated every day: new\r\nmachines, computers, guns, chemicals. In many parts of the\r\nworld, the standard of living is getting higher, but is life\r\nreally getting better? I am not certain that it is. The world\r\nis getting more polluted and more dangerous; wars are still\r\nbeing waged. Why? If people are getting cleverer every\r\nday, why do they not understand each other?\r\nI believe that it is our nature to take. We have to learn\r\nhow to give. Tolerance grows only through education. It is\r\nvery important to understand this so that we may change\r\nthe circumstances in which we live. The legacy of our\r\nparents was that of a different world, a world governed by\r\nthe cold war, and we cannot blame them for it. But we\r\nmust be aware of what we need to learn to change the\r\nworld. The education we need to truly become tolerant is\r\nnot just what our parents and teachers can give; it includes\r\nmeeting people, travelling, participating in cultural and\r\neducational exchanges. We do not have to agree with the\r\nthinking of everyone we encounter. We just have to try to\r\naccept that people do not always think alike.\r\nOne of the routes to tolerance is through the campaign\r\n“All different — all equal”. It is essential to accept others\r\nas they are, without trying to change them, because we can\r\nlive only our own lives, nobody else’s. But there are limits\r\nto tolerance. There is a narrow line between interfering —\r\nmost likely in a well-meaning way — and tolerance. Which\r\nis the most honest way? The answer lies within each of us.\r\nWe have to listen to our hearts.\r\nThe United Nations is a place where people from\r\naround the world can meet and share their views. For now,\r\nit is like a card game. If we want to win, we do not show\r\nother players our cards. And if we show our cards, we do\r\nso only if we are sure that the other player is on our side.\r\nWe do not lay down all our cards together, because there\r\nis always a possibility that someone is keeping something\r\nup their sleeve, and then the others lose. What are we\r\nplaying for? For nothing less than our future.\r\nI understand that people are not always good, with\r\npure intentions, though I wish I could think so.\r\nNevertheless, what if we take the risk of showing our cards\r\nand discover that people are the same everywhere — the\r\nsame living, breathing human beings, people who are\r\nbasically good despite their flaws? While we probably will\r\nnot be ready for such a step in this millennium, I would\r\nlike to think that the third millennium will be the one in\r\nwhich we achieve understanding.\r\nI think the role of youth in this process is so\r\nimportant because we are old enough to know the rules,\r\nyet brave — or inexperienced — enough not to follow\r\nthem. Let us change something in our lives every day,\r\nstarting with small steps, thinking about our actions,\r\ngiving someone an unexpected smile from the heart,\r\nsaying — or withholding — the one word that can change\r\nsomeone’s day. We need children’s and youth assemblies\r\nto unite people from around the globe. Such assemblies\r\nwould serve to share and dream about what is best in the\r\nworld instead of worrying about the problems in our\r\ncountries.\r\nI think that small things are so important in our\r\nlives; sometimes a favourite book, a friend, family, or\r\neven a flower on a different planet — as in Saint-\r\nExupéry’s The Little Prince — can be more important to\r\nour world than economics and politics.\r\nThis is the understanding we need to bring peace\r\nand tolerance to our planet.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Netherlands, Ms. Hilde Laffeber,\r\nElected Representative of Youth.\r\nMs. Laffeber (Netherlands): I am very happy to be\r\ngiven the opportunity to speak here today as a\r\nrepresentative of the Netherlands and as a representative\r\nof the youth of my country on the occasion of the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year. The question is:\r\nwill this anniversary be a real celebration or just another\r\ncommemoration?\r\nThe themes of International Youth Year were\r\nparticipation, development and peace. These were also the\r\nthemes that dominated the guidelines and programmes\r\ninvolving youth adopted at a session of the General\r\nAssembly similar to this one, in 1985. Participation,\r\ndevelopment and peace were also the themes that were\r\nsupposed to be central to the situation of youth in the 10\r\nyears between these meetings. Supposed to be, because —\r\nalthough there is no official evaluation of the most recent\r\nyears of national and international policies involving\r\nyouth at our disposal — these goals have certainly not yet\r\nbeen fulfilled. As regards participation, this cannot be\r\nunderlined more clearly than by the relatively small\r\nnumber of youth delegates present here. In 1985, 50\r\ncountries accredited young people to address the issue of\r\n“Youth”. This year, only about 10 countries have done so.\r\nIn the other areas also, the goals of International Youth\r\nYear are far from having been achieved.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nAs you know, the cold war has ended, and therefore\r\nthe original incentive of putting the theme of peace so\r\nprominently on the agenda of youth policy has disappeared.\r\nBut new wars are being fought, which disrupt the lives of\r\nyoung people in a number of countries and create ever-\r\nincreasing flows of refugees. This is not only a problem for\r\nthe young people themselves; it is also a problem for their\r\nsocieties as a whole.\r\nFor example, in refugee camps, children up to the age\r\nof 16 are generally offered some form of education. Their\r\nparents, mostly women, receive guidance in coping with\r\ntheir new situation and are involved in many activities.\r\nYouth, however, have hardly anything to do in these\r\nrefugee camps. It is not surprising that this continued\r\ninactivity sometimes leads to situations in which they form\r\ngangs and get involved in criminal activities.\r\nWith this attitude, and without education, how can\r\nthese young people be the ones who will lead their\r\ncountries into a new future? Why not try to incorporate\r\nyouth in education and other programmes in the camps to\r\nmake them invest their energy in a positive way, involving\r\nthem in the medical and other social services, or putting\r\nthem in charge of the security of the camps? Creative ideas\r\nto improve the life of young refugees are missing in the\r\ndraft World Programme of Action for Youth as it stands\r\nnow. I do hope this idea will be put on the agenda of the\r\nongoing discussion on youth in the coming years.\r\nYoung people are clearly underrepresented in the field\r\nof social and economic development. A great number of\r\nyoung people are unemployed. Youth unemployment can be\r\nseen as the main reason for the social marginalization of\r\nyouth, wherever they live. They enter a vicious circle of\r\nmarginalization, underemployment and delinquency, for\r\nwhich they are then held responsible.\r\nThis is especially true for young migrants. They are\r\noften discriminated against and resented in their new\r\ncountries or new home towns. Society tends to treat them\r\neither as victims or as criminals. But they are not to blame\r\nfor every crime or for the lack of jobs. It is the role of\r\nGovernments to take up this issue and try to change the\r\nsituation for and with youth.\r\nThe issue of environment and development was barely\r\naddressed in 1985, but it is of crucial importance to the\r\nyouth of today. Governments still seem to overlook the key\r\nrole young people can and should play in the field of\r\nenvironmental development. Young people, not only in my\r\ncountry but also around the world, are very concerned\r\nabout the vulnerability of their environment. More than\r\nthe older generations, today’s youth are taking action in\r\nthe field of environment, varying from very practical\r\nacts — something as simple as cleaning up litter in public\r\nparks — to more elaborate programmes. An example of\r\nthe latter is the partnership that the Commission for\r\nSustainable Development and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme have developed with three\r\nmajor international non-governmental youth organizations\r\ndealing with environmental questions, to set up a large\r\ninformation system for youth on Agenda 21. It has also\r\nbeen decided to celebrate a youth day during the\r\nCommission’s session in 1996. These are exactly the\r\nkinds of projects that can and should be set up when\r\nimplementing the paragraph on the environment of the\r\ndraft World Programme of Action for Youth, as they\r\ncreate a partnership for action between established\r\ninstitutions and youth.\r\nWith regard to International Youth Year:\r\nParticipation, Development and Peace, I think the two\r\nlatter themes of the Year make sense only if the first goal\r\nhas been fulfilled. In other words, is it not just as strange\r\nto have a celebration of the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year without youth as it would be to\r\nhave a Women’s Conference without women?\r\nConsider the following. Youth constitute\r\napproximately one fifth of the world’s population. Youth\r\nhave first-hand information on how they want their lives\r\nto be and how their lives are. Youth want to make a\r\npositive contribution to the discussions on youth-related\r\nissues at the international level. Youth are key agents in\r\nsocial development and change. Participation of youth\r\nbrings with it a lot of responsibilities, with which we are\r\nwilling to deal but first of all, participation of young\r\npeople is a right. However, Governments are the ones\r\nwho can make the choice on whether they will take\r\nparticipation of young people seriously.\r\nSince 1985, and even before that year, several\r\nresolutions have been adopted by this very General\r\nAssembly in which Member States are invited:\r\n“whenever possible, to include youth representatives\r\nin their national delegations to the General Assembly\r\nand other relevant United Nations meetings”\r\n(resolution 47/85, para. 11).\r\nThis invitation found a wide response at the Women’s\r\nConference in Beijing, where over 80 young people were\r\nincluded in the official delegations. Unfortunately, only a\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nfew Member States have included youth representatives in\r\ntheir delegations to this General Assembly.\r\nYouth are defined in the United Nations as women\r\nand men from 15 to 24 years of age. Youth representatives\r\nto the General Assembly are young people in national\r\ndelegations, often elected through a national youth council\r\nor another non-governmental organization platform of\r\nyouth, and accredited as advisers by their foreign offices.\r\nIt is, of course, a very specific instrument for strengthening\r\nthe participation of youth, but it is the one I have most\r\nexperience with. I have participated as a member of the\r\nNetherlands delegation in the informal consultations of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, in the Third Committee,\r\nwhich deals with youth within its social affairs agenda, and\r\nnow in this plenary session on youth. I consider this\r\ninstrument to be a very important one. A good way to be\r\nacknowledged as a full participant — although I am only\r\n19 — by 40-year-old members of other delegations in the\r\ndiscussions is to be able to speak at the same level as they\r\ndo, as a delegate or a representative of my country.\r\nI hope you will consider having a youth delegate in\r\nyour delegation next year, when once again a substantial\r\nresolution on youth will be drafted and adopted. But instead\r\nof a resolution on youth, why not try to make it a\r\nresolution by youth?\r\nThis would certainly be an improvement compared to\r\nthe situation concerning the draft World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth, which, hopefully, we will be adopting\r\ntomorrow. This has been in the drafting stage for several\r\nyears, but only very few young people and youth\r\norganizations have had the chance to influence the draft\r\nProgramme. The enormous negative influence this has had\r\non the draft Programme was very obvious during the\r\nextensive informal consultations of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, earlier this month and during yesterday’s\r\nformal meeting of the Council. Here was a group of\r\ndiplomats, with long experience in life, attempting to\r\nimprove the text of the draft document. It was a very\r\nfrustrating process for a young person. Not that these\r\ndiplomats were incapable or unwilling. But young people\r\nwere a very small minority in these consultations: only\r\nDenmark, Norway and the Netherlands had youth\r\nrepresentatives present there; there were none from other\r\nregions of the world. There were not enough of us to\r\nconvey the concern of youth on how youth would like to\r\nimprove its own situation and on the positive contribution\r\nit can make. So basic information on these issues was also\r\nlacking.\r\nThis example indicates clearly that in the\r\nimplementation of the draft Programme, it is an absolute\r\nnecessity to include participation of youth at all levels and\r\nat all stages of the process. At the international level, an\r\nexcellent opportunity for youth to meet, exchange ideas\r\nand provide the United Nations system, as well as young\r\npeople all over the world, with direct information on\r\nprogrammes involving youth is the Youth Forum of the\r\nUnited Nations system. This Youth Forum was\r\nestablished in 1991 and is first of all a platform for\r\nnational, regional and international youth organizations.\r\nAlso, cooperation between the Forum and the United\r\nNations organizations most involved in youth issues is\r\nvery strong. The main objectives of this Forum are to\r\nstrengthen youth efforts in the field of youth participation,\r\nto establish more effective and efficient channels of\r\ncommunication between and among youth and youth-\r\nserving organizations and agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem, and to promote the implementation and\r\nmonitoring of the draft World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth. The second meeting of this Forum will be held in\r\n1996, and I hope it will prove to be a major factor\r\ncontributing to the implementation of the World\r\nProgramme.\r\nI would conclude that, after a decade of international\r\nyouth policy, we are still far from achieving the goals of\r\nInternational Youth Year: participation, development and\r\npeace. So I cannot really consider this anniversary a\r\ncelebration. It should not, however, be concluded that\r\ninternational youth policy has failed altogether. In fact, in\r\n1995, the new aims of youth policy, as set out in the draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth, are certainly\r\nworth pursuing. But they can be usefully pursued only if\r\nthere is international backing and genuine support from\r\nall quarters, with no hypocrisy or hidden agendas, and\r\nwith the active and full participation of young people at\r\nall levels.\r\nYouth are not the problem: we are the solution.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Turkey, Mr. Çelem.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey): Fifteen years ago, in 1979, the\r\nGeneral Assembly designated 1985 as International Youth\r\nYear. The themes of the Year were participation,\r\ndevelopment and peace. In 1985, the General Assembly\r\nalso endorsed guidelines for producing specific measures\r\naddressing the needs of young people. These guidelines\r\nhave assisted us in formulating plans for the well-being of\r\nyoung people in our countries over the past 10 years.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nTen years should not be considered a long time.\r\nHowever, in the last decade, our world has entered a\r\nprocess of rapid political, economic and socio-cultural\r\nchange, which still continues and which affects us all.\r\nYouth is both benefiting from and falling victim to these\r\ndrastic changes. As experienced in parts of Europe and\r\nAsia, the end of the cold war opened up new horizons and\r\ncreated new opportunities for young people to improve their\r\nskills and to participate in the development and\r\ntransformation efforts of their countries. On the other hand,\r\nas in Bosnia and the Caucasus, armed conflicts brought\r\nabout by these changes forced young people to set aside\r\ntheir hopes for the future and to take up weapons instead of\r\ntaking up books, pens or computers. Instead of peace,\r\ntolerance and progress, they had to set their minds on\r\nmethods to defend their independence and their dignity\r\nagainst aggressors who are inclined to perpetrate crimes of\r\ngenocidal magnitude.\r\nSocieties’ expectations of young people differ\r\naccording to the level of development of a country. Some\r\nsee young people as a key element in the existing\r\ndevelopment process; others expect youth to be a\r\nstimulating force for social transformation. In meeting the\r\nchallenge of creating a society for all, young people occupy\r\nan important place with their unique characteristics. Young\r\npeople in all countries are the guarantee of the future and\r\nof the renewal of generations. Their vision, their ideals and\r\ntheir energies are major sources of sustainable development.\r\nThey all deserve a healthy environment, both physically and\r\nmentally, to develop their skills and contribute to the\r\nachievements of the societies they live in, in accordance\r\nwith our expectations.\r\nIn this respect, the draft World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond (E/1995/123 and\r\nCorr.1) is a well prepared document. It points out major\r\nareas of problems that are contributing to the\r\nmarginalization of young people, and draws a framework of\r\nuniversal standards of action to be applied by national,\r\nregional and international bodies to address these problem\r\nareas. I would like to thank and congratulate all those who\r\nhave spent time and effort on preparing this document. If\r\napproved, the document will eventually become one of the\r\nmost important achievements of the international\r\ncommunity, which has in the last decade concentrated on\r\naddressing key dimensions of social progress.\r\nThe world population between the ages of 15 and 24\r\nis estimated to be over one billion, representing 18 per cent\r\nof the total world population. Eighty-four per cent of that\r\nyoung population lives in developing countries, and in the\r\nfuture that ratio will increase. Implementation of the draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action when adopted, will therefore\r\nbecome a major question in the development efforts of\r\nthose countries, and will bring the issue of regional and\r\ninternational cooperation to the forefront. Taking into\r\naccount the fact that a great majority of young people live\r\nin countries with very limited resources, great\r\nresponsibilities fall on the shoulders of regional and\r\ninternational bodies to assist developing countries in their\r\nresearch, policy studies, planning and coordination\r\nprogrammes relating to youth issues.\r\nTurkey strongly supports the draft World Programme\r\nof Action for Youth, as it puts forward areas of priority\r\nand draws up the framework for global solutions.\r\nIssues concerning youth entered onto the Turkish\r\nagenda for development following the establishment of\r\nthe Republic in 1923. After having lost almost an entire\r\ngeneration of youth during the First World War and the\r\nWar of Independence, to rear a new generation and to\r\nfocus their attention on the development of the country\r\nbecame the most important goals of successive\r\nGovernments. They activated all available resources, and\r\nin a short time a well educated, dedicated generation of\r\nmales and females, in urban and rural areas, joined the\r\ndrive for the development of my country.\r\nFor 70 years Turkey has been annually celebrating\r\none day in its calendar as a children’s holiday, and one\r\nday as a youth holiday. Ataturk, the founder of the\r\nTurkish Republic, in an address to Turkish youth, gave\r\nthem the responsibility of defending and promoting the\r\nideas and ideals of the Republic, encouraging them to\r\nparticipate fully, effectively and constructively in the\r\ndevelopment of the country. Last June, Turkey changed\r\nsome articles of its Constitution, lowering the age limit to\r\nallow younger people to take an active part in the\r\npolitical life of the country.\r\nYoung people in Turkey constitute 21 per cent of the\r\nwhole population. Issues related to youth have always\r\nbeen included in the priority areas of Government\r\nprogrammes. In fact, our national plans and programmes\r\naddressing youth issues have benefited greatly from\r\nUnited Nations themes and guidelines elaborated for this\r\npurpose.\r\nChanges that are taking place in the world have\r\nrepercussions for Turkish society. As one of the\r\nvulnerable sections of society, young people are\r\nsometimes positively affected by changes, such as the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\ndevelopment of information technologies, and sometimes\r\nadversely affected, as in the case of the massive migration\r\nto metropolitan areas in search of a better future.\r\nOfficial, private and voluntary organizations are active\r\nin Turkey to provide a healthy environment for young\r\npeople so that they can develop their skills or learn new\r\nones. Health services are provided to young people either\r\nfree of charge or at a symbolic cost. The challenge\r\nconfronting Turkish institutions is to extend youth services\r\nto all parts of the country as rapidly as possible and, at the\r\nsame time, continue to improve them.\r\nIn Turkey, programmes addressing youth-related issues\r\nare designed to foster tolerance, respect and understanding\r\namong young females and males, without discrimination.\r\nWe cannot remain satisfied with what has been\r\nachieved up to now. In meeting the needs of young people,\r\nand in providing them with the necessary services to ensure\r\nhealth, development, training and happiness, there is always\r\nground for improvement. The World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, once adopted, will\r\nundoubtedly be a very useful guide in our national efforts,\r\nas well as in the efforts of the international community as\r\na whole.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nJapan.\r\nMs. Horiuchi (Japan): Just two days ago, Heads of\r\nState and Government assembled in this General Assembly\r\nHall to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations and to express their commitment to the creation of\r\na better world for tomorrow. They addressed the question\r\nof how to shape that future the better to serve the needs of\r\npeople everywhere, and at the conclusion of the series of\r\nmeetings they adopted a Declaration embodying their\r\ncommon views on this subject.\r\nToday, we gather to discuss the issue of youth. It is\r\nyoung people who in the future will act on the hopes and\r\naspirations of humankind. In our view, it is therefore\r\nappropriate that we should now be taking part in this\r\nspecial meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year.\r\nIt is true, as is stated in the draft World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, that:\r\n“Young people represent agents, beneficiaries and\r\nvictims of major societal changes and are generally\r\nconfronted by a paradox: to seek to be integrated\r\ninto an existing order or to serve as a force to\r\ntransform that order.” (E/1995/123, para. 2).\r\nIt is for this reason that serious consideration must be\r\ngiven to the issues that confront young people and to the\r\nconcerns that occupy them.\r\nSome progress has been made in enhancing the well-\r\nbeing of people around the world. However, the profound\r\ntransformation that the international community has\r\nundergone in the last few years has increased political and\r\nsocial instability to some extent. While the cold war has\r\nended, the world continues to be plagued by, for example,\r\nrecurrent regional conflict. Young people today live in\r\nconditions of considerable uncertainty. Yet there is hope\r\nthat conditions will improve in the next millennium.\r\nAt the important World Conference on Women held\r\nlast month in Beijing, and throughout the regional\r\npreparatory meetings, emphasis was placed on young\r\nwomen and girls as important agents of change, but also\r\nas persons unable fully to enjoy equal rights, and a\r\nspecial effort was made to promote their participation. In\r\npart as a result, problems such as underdevelopment,\r\nunemployment, HIV/AIDS, street children and adolescents\r\nwere identified, and concern was expressed about the\r\nrapid spread of information technology and consumerism,\r\nas well as about the need to promote peace. To attack the\r\ninjustices that women and girls confront, the Conference\r\nadopted a Programme of Action. It remains for us to\r\ntranslate the words of that Programme into action.\r\nI should like now to turn to some of the issues\r\nfacing Japan. A recent survey conducted by my\r\nGovernment reveals a certain mental and physical\r\nweakness that Japanese young people have developed as\r\na result of growing up in an affluent society. Accordingly,\r\nmy Government’s central concern with respect to young\r\npeople is to foster in them the mental and physical\r\nstrength that they will require to shoulder the challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nTo that end, Japan has established and developed\r\nwhat it refers to as friendship networks. In 1985, for\r\nexample, in commemoration of International Youth Year,\r\nthe Government launched the International Youth Village\r\nProgramme, which brings Japanese and foreign youth\r\ntogether every year to learn about each other and to\r\nengage in a variety of educational activities. This year,\r\n600 young people visited the International Village for a\r\nweek — twice as many as in 1985, the first year of its\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\noperation. Japan also conducts several international youth\r\nexchange programmes — for example, the Ship for World\r\nYouth, the Ship for South East Asian Youth, the\r\nInternational Youth Development Exchange Programme and\r\nexchanges with Korea and China. Furthermore, 2,000\r\nJapanese young people are currently in developing countries\r\nas Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers, contributing\r\ntheir skills and energies to the efforts those countries are\r\nmaking to promote development.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to touch upon an\r\ninitiative that Japan has taken recently. On the occasion of\r\nthe historic fiftieth anniversary of the end of the War, my\r\nGovernment launched a project called the Peace, Friendship\r\nand Exchange Initiative, the aim of which is to build future-\r\noriented relations with our Asian neighbours and other\r\ncountries by confronting the past squarely and promoting\r\nmutual understanding. The Initiative includes several youth\r\nexchange programmes and student-abroad exchanges which\r\naim to promote mutual understanding among members of\r\nthe younger generation. For example, every year\r\napproximately 130 young people are invited to participate\r\nin an Asian and Pacific Youth Forum.\r\nWhile almost half a century has passed since the end\r\nof the War, a vast majority of people today did not\r\nexperience it. In order to make sure that the horrors that\r\noccurred never occur again, we must not forget what took\r\nplace. In this time of peace and abundance, it is all the\r\nmore essential that we reflect on past errors, convey to\r\nfuture generations the violence and brutality of war and the\r\nmany lives that were lost, and work resolutely for lasting\r\npeace.\r\nThe Government of Japan has long been aware of the\r\nmultidisciplinary nature of the issue of youth. In 1949, after\r\nthe War, an advisory council was established to ensure that\r\nthe views of citizens were reflected in governmental policy.\r\nAnd in 1966 the Youth Bureau, subsequently reorganized\r\nas the Youth Affairs Administration, was created within the\r\nPrime Minister’s Office to maintain coordination among the\r\ngovernment ministries concerned and to implement\r\nmeasures relating to youth, in particular, international\r\nexchange programmes. The Government of Japan is of the\r\nview that it is essential to have a coordinating body of this\r\nkind to monitor and review overall policies and\r\nprogrammes relating to youth.\r\nOur efforts to follow up International Youth Year\r\nresulted in 1989 in the formulation of a national plan of\r\naction, which was then revised in 1994. The plan addressed\r\nthe issues of education, employment, juvenile delinquency,\r\npersonal development and the family, and called for\r\npublic information campaigns and research studies to be\r\ncarried out. Ratification by Japan of the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child is helping to integrate our policies\r\non youth, and we intend to further promote such policies\r\nand programmes, taking into consideration the outcomes\r\nof recent international conferences such as those held in\r\nVienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, and Beijing.\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate that as partners and\r\nagents as well as beneficiaries of social development,\r\nyoung people are the key to building a better world.\r\nGovernment, non-governmental organizations and the\r\ninternational community must therefore work together on\r\ntheir behalf.\r\nI would like to conclude by saying that while it is\r\nyouth, the next generation, who hold the future in their\r\nhands, it is we, the Governments of the world, that are\r\nresponsible for their well-being today. Our success today\r\nwill help to determine their success tomorrow.\r\nAccordingly, the Government of Japan would like to\r\naffirm its renewed commitment to promoting respect for\r\nthe rights, and to realize the potential, of young people\r\neverywhere.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Indonesia, Mr. Wisnumurti.\r\nMr. Wisnumurti (Indonesia): It is an honour for me\r\nto deliver this statement today on behalf of the Indonesian\r\nMinister of Education and Culture, Professor\r\nDr. Wardiman Djojonegoro, who, due to unforeseen\r\nevents, is unable to attend this meeting of the General\r\nAssembly dedicated to youth throughout the world.\r\nThis session has a special meaning for Indonesia. A\r\nrelatively young nation, this year we are celebrating 50\r\nyears of independence. And, it was the young people of\r\nIndonesia who took centre stage in our drive towards\r\nindependence and in charting a successful course for the\r\ncountry over the past five decades. Indeed, in 1928 it was\r\nyoung Indonesians from all over the archipelago who\r\ninitiated the nationalist movement, ultimately leading to\r\nour Proclamation of Independence in 1945. Their effort is\r\ncommemorated each year on 28 October, which is\r\nobserved as Youth Oath Day.\r\nAccordingly, the Indonesian delegation is most\r\npleased to participate in these proceedings, which mark\r\nthe tenth anniversary of International Youth Year. On\r\nbehalf of the Indonesian Government, I would therefore\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nlike to take this opportunity to renew Indonesia’s\r\nfundamental commitment to concerted action on behalf of\r\nyouth throughout the world.\r\nThere is a well-known saying that “One who possesses\r\nyouth possesses the future”. These words of wisdom carry\r\na very important message for all of us. If we, as sovereign\r\nnations, want to create a world of peace and prosperity for\r\nall, then we must care for and nurture our young\r\ngeneration, imbue them with a sense of responsibility, and\r\nprovide them with the necessary skills to meet future\r\nchallenges.\r\nAt the present time, however, there are numerous\r\nproblems that must be addressed. The population between\r\nthe ages of 15 and 30 has more than doubled over the last\r\n50 years, by far the largest increase occurring in the\r\ndeveloping countries. For some, this has presented\r\ntremendous burdens. For many, it has limited the resources\r\navailable to youth and for development programmes that\r\noffer hope and opportunity. Increasing population growth\r\nrates have been a contributing factor in the widening gap\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries, and\r\nbetween the rich and poor. At times, this has resulted in a\r\nmarginalization of young people, creating the feeling —\r\nand frequently the reality — that they are disenfranchised.\r\nAlso, while we all hail the benefits of growth,\r\ndevelopment and industrialization with the potential for\r\nsocio-economic progress, we recognize that uneven patterns\r\nof development can contribute to harmful patterns of\r\nmigration. The migration of youth from rural to urban\r\nareas, and even across national boundaries, in search of\r\nemployment and a better life does not always meet with\r\nsuccess. For many young people, it is a rude awakening to\r\ndiscover that development may in fact pass them over,\r\nleaving behind a generation that is disillusioned and\r\nalienated, for whom it is too difficult to imagine that they\r\ndo represent the future.\r\nToo often, our actions do not match our words. When\r\nthe international community professes stewardship and wise\r\nuse of natural resources, and of the environment, the reality\r\nis frequently better characterized as depletion of precious\r\nassets — assets that directly affect the livelihood of future\r\ngenerations. We too often fail to recognize that the harmful\r\npractices of today create a shameful legacy for our youth,\r\nwho are left to correct problems which were not of their\r\nown doing.\r\nWhere in the past our societies found sustenance and\r\nresilience in cultural values passed on from generation to\r\ngeneration, the current era of globalization seriously\r\nthreatens established orders, causing a widening schism\r\nbetween old and new. Without strong values and a sense\r\nof identity, only confusion rises to the surface. And\r\nwithin such an environment, it is not surprising that drug\r\nabuse, crime and unacceptable lifestyles — sexual or\r\notherwise — are on the rise.\r\nAgainst this background, it is gratifying to note that\r\nthis session of the General Assembly will deliberate on\r\nthe draft World Programme of Action for Youth to the\r\nYear 2000 and Beyond. Although the Indonesian\r\ndelegation has recommendations that we feel would\r\nimprove the current text prior to adoption, we fully\r\nendorse it as an important first step on the way to\r\ncreating a better future for all.\r\nWe must recognize, however, that this is only the\r\nfirst step. Much more needs to be accomplished, and the\r\nUnited Nations is the only body capable of undertaking\r\nthe necessary activities. This Organization, and all of its\r\nspecialized agencies, should therefore vigorously review\r\nthe current conditions of youth throughout the world. At\r\nthe same time, while we acknowledge the fundamental\r\nimportance of the United Nations as the best forum to\r\nredress inequities with respect to youth, we as individual\r\nnations must all work to support that effort.\r\nIn Indonesia, we take this responsibility very\r\nseriously. From the beginning, young Indonesians have\r\nconsistently taken an active part in the nation’s\r\ndevelopment. At present, 31 youth organizations,\r\ncombined in one National Commission for Indonesian\r\nYouth and representing various religious and political\r\npersuasions, actively participate in parliamentary\r\ndiscussions.\r\nIn that regard, our People’s Consultative Assembly\r\nhas directed the Government to plan and initiate youth\r\nprogrammes aimed at preparing the future generation,\r\nincluding national leaders — a generation which should\r\nbe disciplined, responsive and self-reliant, and with a high\r\nwork ethos. Most important, youth development in\r\nIndonesia is directed towards strengthening young people\r\nso that they will be capable of facing the challenges\r\nassociated with Indonesia’s continued development. In\r\nthis respect, the focus is on imparting to the young a\r\nsense of responsibility to become pioneers of Indonesia’s\r\nfuture development, similar to their fathers before them\r\nwho fought for independence.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nOur programmatic approach, which is elaborated in a\r\ncountry paper, goes across sectors, with intersectoral\r\nsolutions. It addresses such areas as education, employment,\r\nhunger and poverty, health, environment, drug abuse,\r\njuvenile delinquency and provisions for constructive leisure\r\ntime activities. Our approach is also holistic, thus\r\nacknowledging that the education of youth must be paired\r\nwith opportunities for advancement and employment, while\r\ngiving them a sense of pride in country and compassion for\r\nall humankind. In short, our efforts are focused on\r\npreparing our youth to compete in a global environment,\r\nand on strengthening their own unique identity as\r\nIndonesians. We believe that this will strengthen the\r\nresilience of Indonesian youth to face the future with\r\nconfidence.\r\nIndonesia’s efforts to date, including those within the\r\nframework of the Non-Aligned Movement, have convinced\r\nus that we can and must contribute to the resolution of the\r\nproblems confronted by the youth in Indonesia and\r\nthroughout the world. Ultimate resolution of those problems\r\nwill undoubtedly require the most intense cooperation by all\r\nof us.\r\nWe should direct our efforts towards gaining insight\r\ninto programmes and proposals that are helpful to\r\nindividual nations, and that are appropriate to specific\r\nsituations and conditions. Through our deliberations, we can\r\nlearn how to solve our common problems, utilizing the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies as a medium\r\nfor progress. Finally, our cooperation should be directed\r\ntowards developing better monitoring mechanisms and\r\npreventing the occurrence of youth problems all over the\r\nworld, now and in the future. It is my sincere hope that the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly will strengthen\r\nsuch cooperation, for the benefit of all youth.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Zaid Abdul-Aleem,\r\nStudent Delegate of the United States of America.\r\nMr. Abdul-Aleem (United States of America): I am\r\nvery proud and pleased to have the opportunity to speak\r\ntoday on the theme of youth in the global context. As an\r\nAfrican-American citizen of the United States from a major\r\nmetropolitan area — Chicago — a Fulbright Scholar in El\r\nSalvador and Brazil, and a Muslim, I bring a perspective on\r\nyouth in both developed and developing counties that can\r\nlend a unique voice to these discussions.\r\nWhile I have this opportunity to speak here today, I\r\nthink of many individuals whose opinions and ideas are not\r\nrecognized, including youth. While globalization can be\r\nproductive, it can also be very destructive in its effect on\r\ncertain sectors of the global society if people are not\r\nincluded, if their voices are not heard, and if their ideas\r\nnot incorporated into policies.\r\nMr. Abibi (Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nGovernments around the world, including my own,\r\nhave officially recognized the need to consult with and\r\nwork with those individuals, including youth, for whom\r\ncommitments were made in the programmes of action\r\nresulting from recent international conferences — such as\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women. However, these\r\ncommitments must become reality. For this, the voices of\r\nyouth, as well as others, must be heard.\r\nIn preparation for this meeting, I asked a variety\r\npeople in the United States and Brazil what they thought\r\nthe role of youth should be in globalization. The answers\r\nwere generally as follows: “Globalization? What is that?”\r\n“Globalization? Yeah, I know what that is. That’s\r\nsomething for the first world. It can’t help us in the third\r\nworld.” “Globalization? I don’t know what that is, but\r\nchildren today need better access to education.” And,\r\n“Globalization? I don’t know what that is, but my\r\nGovernment needs to listen to all leaders in my society,\r\nnot just the rich and powerful.”\r\nWe recognize that these responses articulate the\r\nissues that the global community must address. And I\r\nknow that there are a lot of people including those here\r\nin the United Nations and elsewhere in the world who are\r\nbusy trying to answer these questions. However, I cannot\r\nreiterate enough the importance of listening to the voices\r\nof youth and paying attention to the solutions they\r\npropose. But, how do we prepare youth so that they —\r\nwe — have the confidence to make our voices heard?\r\nAn exceptional few might make it but the majority\r\nof youth must be nurtured. As long as I can remember, I\r\nwas told that I could do anything I wanted to do. I heard\r\nthat message at home, in school and in the community.\r\nYoung people around the world need to hear the same\r\nmessage on a regular basis. They should be free from\r\ndiscrimination due to race, class, caste or gender. They\r\nmust be sufficiently free to dream and to believe that\r\nthose dreams can become a reality.\r\nHowever, having a dream does not make it come\r\ntrue. Through the material and spiritual support of my\r\nfamily, the positive influence of friends and support\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\ngroups in the community, and a culturally enriching\r\neducation, I was able to develop the pride, confidence and\r\ncritical thinking skills that would later create opportunities\r\nfor me. For only if they are provided a supportive\r\nenvironment in the home, community and school will\r\nchildren develop into youth who can recognize and create\r\nopportunities for themselves.\r\nInvestment in the family, investment in the community\r\nand investment in education must be addressed locally,\r\nnationally and globally. By providing youth with\r\nopportunities to cultivate their assets, develop their skills\r\nand their environment, and become confident in themselves,\r\nfuture generations will see a true global community\r\nrepresenting all voices. Imagine the ills of racism,\r\ndiscrimination, sexism and ethnic conflict meeting head-on\r\nwith masses of educated, well-informed, culturally rich and\r\nconfident citizens. And imagine globalization proving to be\r\nmore than just a political buzzword without a definition that\r\nprompts creative action.\r\nWhile much work remains to be done to achieve our\r\ndomestic as well as our international commitments for\r\ndomestic social development, the United States has\r\ndesigned an array of activities to empower students as\r\ncitizens and to ensure the safe passage of youth through the\r\ntransition from adolescence to young adulthood. Examples\r\ninclude comprehensive services to reduce teenage\r\npregnancy; the President’s tobacco initiative to reduce\r\nsmoking by children and adolescents by 50 per cent in the\r\nnext seven years; community schools to forge partnerships\r\nat the community level and provide a place for youth to go\r\nafter school and on weekends; enterprise communities\r\nwhere private and public institutions will collaborate to\r\nrevitalize communities by improving job opportunities,\r\nhousing, transportation and services; and a variety of\r\nprogrammes designed to address drug and alcohol abuse\r\nand substance abuse-related violence.\r\nMost importantly, youth will be included in\r\nimplementing these programmes in their own communities.\r\nThe promise of education continues to be a major\r\nfocus of efforts to empower our citizens. The Goals 2000:\r\nEducate America Act of 1994 supports grass-roots efforts\r\nto help schoolchildren meet high standards for achievement\r\nand discipline. School-to-work programmes are uniting\r\nbusinesses, community colleges, and high schools to\r\nprovide work-study experience and technical expertise.\r\nIn the past, young people did not routinely participate\r\nin developing their own educational plans. Now the Act\r\nmandates that students be invited to participate in\r\ndeveloping, revising and reviewing their plans to ensure\r\nthat their preferences and interests are considered. These\r\nprogrammes demonstrate the importance the United States\r\nGovernment places on investment in the family,\r\ncommunity and education. However, they do not pretend\r\nto solve all our problems. Little will be accomplished\r\nunless young men and young women see the value of the\r\nprogrammes, have access to them, and take ownership of\r\nthem. Nevertheless, programmes such as these might\r\nserve as useful models for confronting similar problems\r\nin other countries. In turn, programmes in other countries\r\ncan undoubtedly enrich my country. While these models\r\nare a good start, they are nothing without proper\r\nimplementation.\r\nWhatever the appropriate model, we must move\r\nforward together with solutions. In doing so we should\r\nrecall that, while youth may be the principal beneficiaries\r\nof programmes to strengthen the home, community, and\r\nschool, youth can also contribute to the design and\r\nimplementation of those solutions. We must make it\r\npossible for the voices of youth to be heard. We must\r\nalso, as youth, demand of ourselves that we take the\r\ninitiative to be involved. With our voices, we can provide\r\npart of the answer. We will be part of the solution.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Permanent Representative of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Mr. Park Soo Gil.\r\nMr. Park Soo Gil (Republic of Korea): I should\r\nfirst like to commend the fiftieth anniversary secretariat\r\nand, in particular the Youth Task Force, for their\r\npreparations for the tenth anniversary of International\r\nYouth Year and their support for youth-related events and\r\nactivities.\r\nThe celebration of the capability and positive\r\ncontributions of youth worldwide culminates this year in\r\nthe tenth anniversary of International Youth Year. In\r\nrecognition of the fact that the young men and women\r\nwho are the dreamers of today will be the decision-\r\nmakers of tomorrow, the decade-long observance of\r\nInternational Youth Year has progressively contributed to\r\nthe formulation of more focused and effective global\r\nyouth policies.\r\nIn order to continue to prepare for the time when\r\none generation passes the baton of leadership to the next,\r\nI believe that it would be useful for broad channels of\r\nintergenerational communication to be established. This\r\nwould help promote dialogue on the issues and concerns\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nthat affect today’s youth and the challenges that await them\r\nas a collective generation.\r\nWith the world youth population currently at\r\napproximately 1.03 billion, the majority of whom reside in\r\ndeveloping countries, it is critical to position youth policies\r\nand programmes as an integral part of all development\r\ngoals. Indeed, it is only through a “holistic social\r\napproach”, which envisions long-term solutions and a\r\ncomprehensive strategy, that the international community\r\ncan begin truly to address the problems that threaten the\r\nwell-being of youth and hamper their full potential as a\r\npositive force in society. In this regard, both the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, held this year, presented a timely\r\nand important opportunity for us to address the significance\r\nof youth in development.\r\nIn the light of the disturbing fact that children and\r\nyoung people are the primary victims of poverty and\r\nconflict in developing countries, it is clear that special focus\r\nmust be given to them in our social development efforts.\r\nAnother key element in our approach should be the pursuit\r\nof equal rights for women, by eliminating discrimination at\r\nan early age, expanding their opportunities in all areas,\r\nincluding education and health care, and elevating self-\r\nworth in society. The Republic of Korea wishes to see the\r\nWorld Youth Programme of Action to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond adopted by consensus during this plenary session.\r\nAmong the priority areas suggested by the draft Programme\r\nof Action, the eradication of hunger and of absolute poverty\r\nare two of the most pressing issues at hand. As basic rights\r\nwhich should be afforded to any human being, it is crucial\r\nthat the international community make the utmost effort to\r\ncooperate in resolving these problems.\r\nAnother critical area which requires concerted\r\ninternational cooperation is long-term human resources\r\ndevelopment. The decade-long experience of my own\r\ncountry’s development process has proved that the\r\neducation and training of young people is the key to\r\nsuccess. Therefore, my delegation would like to stress the\r\nimportance of improving the level of basic education,\r\ndeveloping a wide array of vocational skills and raising\r\nliteracy among youth.\r\nAlthough global youth clearly represents a diverse\r\npopulation, coming from different cultures and varying\r\nsocio-economic backgrounds, there are some problems\r\nwhich they commonly share. Among the most impending\r\ndangers are drug abuse, criminal activities and the growing\r\nperil of intolerance, which the international community\r\nmust strive to overcome as threats to the well-being of its\r\nyoung members.\r\nIn the Republic of Korea, we have established a\r\ncomprehensive long-term plan for youth entitled the\r\n1992-2001 Basic Plan for the Youth of Korea, which has\r\nnow been incorporated into the seventh and eighth half-\r\ndecade Socioeconomic Development Plan. Moreover, in\r\norder to ensure the effective implementation of this\r\nprogramme, the Korean Government enacted a Basic Law\r\non Youth in December 1992, which was designated as\r\nNational Year for Youth. That same year, the Youth\r\nDevelopment Committee was established under the\r\nauspices of the Prime Minister. We also currently sponsor\r\nannual exchange activities with seven Asian countries. By\r\nthe year 2000, a Youth International Exchange Centre will\r\nbe established for the administration of various\r\ninternational activities of young people.\r\nCommemorating the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year and recognizing the vast\r\npotential of youth all over the world, my Government\r\nhosted the World Youth Leaders’ Conference in Seoul in\r\nMay 1995, which was organized by the International\r\nAssociation of University Presidents and the Korean\r\nInstitute for Youth Development, with the participation of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Conference was attended by students, scholars\r\nand academic leaders from 64 countries, as well as\r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations. The Conference,\r\nwhose theme was “What Should We Prepare for the\r\nTwenty-first Century?” was a forum for the participants\r\nto reflect upon contemporary youth culture and to define\r\nthe role and responsibility of the new generation in the\r\nage of globalization. The Conference provided these\r\nyoung people with a valuable opportunity to voice their\r\nconcerns and share their visions with the older generation.\r\nThe outcome of the Conference was the Seoul Declaration\r\non an Ethical Renaissance and the International Student\r\nInitiative 1995. The final report of the Conference has\r\nbeen distributed as an official document (A/50/454) of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAn especially encouraging outcome of the\r\nConference was the emphasis that today’s youth placed\r\non the need for the restoration of morality and humanity\r\nin society. As the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, stated in his message at the beginning of\r\nthe Conference, it is essential that young people be\r\nempowered to utilize their freedom, energy and talents to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\ncreate a world of tolerance and mutual respect and a sense\r\nof a shared human venture.\r\nAlthough it is ultimately the responsibility of each\r\nMember State to address its own youth affairs, the United\r\nNations can play a vital role in assisting national efforts in\r\npolicy-making, implementation and coordination with other\r\nactors, including civil society.\r\nLet me say, in closing, that the coming century will\r\nnot be the era of my generation, but that of the young\r\nindividuals who are only now embarking upon their adult\r\nlives. The youth of today must be wholly recognized as\r\nvaluable members of the global society, and their visions\r\nand input can be a positive contribution to building a strong\r\nand just world community.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on Eileen Coparropa, Special Envoy of the\r\nPresident of Panama.\r\nMiss Coparropa (Panama) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me first of all to extend my congratulations\r\nto the President on his election to guide our discussions at\r\nthese special meetings devoted to the commemoration of\r\nthe tenth anniversary of International Youth Year and the\r\ndiscussion of the World Programme of Action for Youth to\r\nthe year 2000 and beyond.\r\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, I join the millions of young people who are\r\nbeginning to recognize their value and importance in the\r\nlife of the international community. I share the joy of all\r\nthe young people of the world at this initiative, which gives\r\nus our own voice and makes it possible for me to express\r\nto the Governments and institutions represented here the\r\nviewpoints of my country’s young people and my\r\ndelegation on the documents that have been drafted and\r\ndiscussed in recent years. I ask the President to convey our\r\nappreciation and gratitude to all those who have cooperated\r\nin preparing those documents for their important\r\ncontributions to clarifying this complex issue, formulating\r\nobjectives and defining measures with which to address it.\r\nThe presence of young people at this meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is of particular importance because,\r\nwhile we are the beneficiaries of many national and\r\ninternational initiatives, we are also victims of the profound\r\nchanges taking place in contemporary society. No one has\r\nthe slightest doubt that the policies formulated and adopted\r\nby our Governments and international agencies in this area\r\nhave important effects on the daily life and the future of\r\nyoung people. We therefore wish to be a party to these\r\ndecisions, and, above all, we know that we can act as\r\nagents of change because of our willingness to achieve a\r\nbetter way of living together, both domestically and\r\ninternationally. To that end, we offer our hope, dynamism\r\nand dedication.\r\nIt is from this perspective that we aspire to play a\r\nlarger role in the life of our societies, now more than\r\never, because today the very way in which we define,\r\nunderstand and value human beings is being profoundly\r\naffected by advances in science, technology, health and\r\ninformation.\r\nMy country is renowned for its geographic position\r\nand for the Panama Canal — that marvel of engineering,\r\nbridge of the world, heart of the universe through which\r\npass tangible and intangible commodities from the four\r\ncorners of the world. My country is a crossroads and a\r\nmeeting place for races and cultures, and my people are\r\nnoble, peaceful and cosmopolitan. We are attached to our\r\ntraditions and proud of our traditional costume, the\r\npollera, and the rhythmic expression of our dance, the\r\ntamborito.\r\nToday, in preparing to receive, incorporate and\r\nutilize the territory of the Canal Zone on\r\n31 December 1999, when the Torrijos-Carter treaties on\r\nthe Panama Canal go into effect, my country faces the\r\ngreatest challenge and opportunity since independence.\r\nThis significant triumph for our nationhood has resulted\r\nmainly from the efforts of generations and generations of\r\nPanamanians. In the struggle, young people made the\r\ngreatest part of the sacrifice, and their exploits inspired us\r\nin the process of enhancing national sovereignty and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nHowever, in my country 66 per cent of the\r\npopulation are under the age of 35 and people between\r\nthe ages of 15 and 24 represent 21 per cent of the total\r\npopulation. Of that youthful sector of the population, 42\r\nper cent are employable, yet their unemployment rate has\r\nreached 21 per cent, twice the national average. Of those\r\nwho do work, 35 per cent have a monthly income of less\r\nthan $250, and some 14 per cent make less than $100 a\r\nmonth. This means that almost half of the young\r\npopulation in our country is living below the poverty line.\r\nPanama is not spared the tensions that arise when\r\nyoung people are caught between hope and\r\nmarginalization, between efforts to maintain our national\r\nidentity and pressure from other cultures, between the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\ndesire to dare to be oneself and the overwhelming power of\r\nfads and fashions, and between the challenges of the\r\nscourge of drugs and the weakening of ethical and moral\r\nvalues, a tragic equation whose result is a more fragile\r\nfamily, which is the basic institution of civilized life for the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nWe come here today aware that there are large,\r\ncomplex problems yet to be solved. We are subject to the\r\nfactors that temper the optimism of most young people in\r\nthe developing world. We know that we are living in a very\r\ncomplex world and that the simplicity of our lives as young\r\npeople does not exempt us from feelings of anxiety and\r\nimpatience. We recognize the values and the capital that\r\nadults have left to us, and we are proud that they have\r\nforged a social existence which allows no room for\r\nintolerance based on racial, religious or cultural\r\nconsiderations. This enables us to live in a society in which\r\nyoung people are not affected by discrimination or\r\nprejudice.\r\nAnd yet young Panamanian women can see that in our\r\nsociety there are some disparities between the sexes.\r\nDespite the fact that primary education has been free and\r\nmandatory under the Constitution since the early days of\r\nthe Republic, there is a sector of our young population that,\r\nbecause of economic and social factors leading to hunger,\r\npoverty and social disintegration, is more exposed to\r\nmarginalization and crime — in short, to exclusion.\r\nFor most young Panamanians, the management of free\r\ntime and its use for creative and healthy activities is a\r\nproblem of concern to adults. The average income of the\r\nPanamanian family is insufficient to ensure that children\r\nand teenagers appropriately and consistently benefit from\r\ntheir free time.\r\nIt should therefore come as no surprise that I — an\r\nathlete, a swimmer — am making a special appeal to\r\ninternational organs and non-governmental organizations to\r\nhelp needy countries, and my country in particular, to\r\nseriously consider responding in their plans of action to our\r\nyoung people’s demand that the necessary resources be\r\nallocated to sports, that sports centres be maintained and\r\nthat new recreation areas be provided, these being necessary\r\nfor healthy forms of entertainment and the development of\r\na healthy mind in a healthy body.\r\nAthletes are said to be the ambassadors of the world.\r\nI am certain that my appointment to represent Panamanian\r\nyouth at the General Assembly is an example of the fact\r\nthat young people involved in sports are showing that for\r\nyoung people the way to success, on the threshold of a\r\nnew century, is through education and the cultivation of\r\ndiscipline, maturity, responsibility and the willingness to\r\nface challenges.\r\nIn his report “An Agenda for Peace”, submitted in\r\n1992, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, stated that an\r\nagenda for peace cannot be possible or lasting unless we\r\nencourage and promote “a new spirit of commonality”\r\n(A/47/277, para. 6).\r\nWe young people have felt, sometimes rightly and\r\nsometimes wrongly, that we have been excluded from a\r\nworld built by adults and that, intentionally or\r\nunintentionally, we have not been allowed to participate\r\nin this spirit of commonality, which is so necessary in\r\norder to build a genuine culture of peace.\r\nTherefore, serving as the voice of some half million\r\nPanamanian youths, I request that the obstacles to our\r\nparticipation be removed and that all forms of\r\ndiscrimination be done away with. I request that we be\r\nconsulted as appropriate and that we be allowed a more\r\ndirect involvement in formulating policies on issues\r\nrelated to youth; in the relevant decision-making\r\nprocesses; in drafting and assessing national development\r\npolicies and plans; and in implementing plans to fight\r\ndrug addiction and the harmful effects of drugs.\r\nIn particular, we need our parents to assume the\r\nresponsibility they took on by bringing us into the world,\r\nto lovingly strengthen our ethical and moral values and to\r\ngive us the affection, devotion and the communication we\r\nso desperately need.\r\nTo the young people of my country and the young\r\npeople of the entire world, I wish to say that a new\r\nlifestyle is clearly needed, and that it will require all of us\r\nto change, especially youth. Youth is, first and foremost,\r\nheroism. Pope John Paul II acknowledged that\r\n“Young people have immense potential for goodness\r\nand creativity.”\r\nAlong with our Holy Father, we must repeat that our\r\nenthusiasm is needed, as is our love of life. We must\r\nhave the courage to be different, to be idealistic, to\r\nchallenge in order to reform, to demand in order to\r\nparticipate. But above all, we must not be afraid to try to\r\nbuild a world in which we can live in harmony with\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nnature, with humankind and with God, to build a new\r\nculture of solidarity.\r\nWhat I have expressed today is what the youth of my\r\ncountry feels, as shown in an opinion poll that I wrote and\r\ncarried out in order to reflect their concerns and their hopes\r\nas faithfully as possible.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to say that many words have been\r\nsaid, but now we must see to it that these words do not lose\r\ntheir credibility. It is time to lead by example. Our actions\r\nmust reflect our words. By example, we should learn proper\r\nbehaviour, love for our homeland and for nature, respect for\r\nfamily values and solidarity with those who have less or\r\nwho have nothing.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on Mr. Peter Friis-Nielsen, Youth Delegate of\r\nDenmark.\r\nMr. Friis-Nielsen (Denmark): As the representative of\r\nthe Danish Youth Council and as a Youth Representative in\r\nthe Danish delegation to the General Assembly, I am very\r\npleased to speak at this plenary meeting.\r\n“Why does youth always have to become older before\r\nit is allowed to deal with the problems concerning\r\nyouth?”\r\nThat reflection was made by Danish author Carl\r\nScharnberg. The following quotation is from the general\r\nexchange of views of Heads of State at the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development. Listen carefully:\r\n“No nation can ignore its youth, which is a human\r\nresource for sustainable development.”\r\nThis year — the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations — we also celebrate the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year, held in 1985. Since then youth\r\nissues have become even more crucial, affecting not only\r\na small group but an important and rapidly growing part of\r\nthe world population. Today there are more than\r\n1.03 billion people between the ages of 15 and 24. If we\r\nassess the condition of the youth of today, we see that\r\nthroughout the world young people very often find\r\nthemselves stigmatized as a vulnerable group, as an object\r\nexposed to a variety of problems. But young people are not\r\nmerely an object; they are subjects — the subjects of the\r\nfuture. The world community needs a new approach to\r\nyoung people. We need action, and we need it now.\r\nThis new approach and plan of action will take its\r\nfirst leap forward through the draft World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth, which we hope will be adopted\r\ntomorrow. With youth on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly, no one can reasonably ignore the importance\r\nof this topic.\r\nHowever, reading the draft World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth confirms that youth is still put in a\r\nbiased and traditional position. The section of the\r\nprogramme on “Development setting” states that\r\n“Young people in all countries are both a major\r\nhuman resource for development and key agents for\r\nsocial change, economic development and\r\ntechnological innovation.” (E/1995/123, para. 12)\r\nBut this philosophy is not reflected throughout the\r\ndocument. In fact, it is almost absent in the final draft\r\ndocument, superseded by a rather paternalistic attitude.\r\nHas the draft World Programme of Action for Youth\r\nbecome a document on youth based on the premises of\r\nthe elders?\r\nFor a solution to the problems discussed in the\r\ndocument, young people must be recognized as an asset\r\nand as genuine partners in the decision-making\r\nprocesses — as subjects of their own lives, not objects.\r\nWhere is the youth spirit in the document — the spirit\r\nthat proposes new ideas, new thoughts, new visions, new\r\nimpetus and actions that will make the youth programme\r\nthe tool it is meant to be? I search for this youth spirit —\r\nand I still long to find it.\r\nThe draft World Programme of Action for Youth has\r\nnot become what we hoped it would; it has become a\r\nhammer without a handle, but it is the only tool we have.\r\nSo let us act and create the handle in the process.\r\nA Danish slogan once said that, “action is the best\r\nexpression of opinion”. Hence, to turn opinion into action\r\nhere today, a full and visionary implementation of the\r\ndraft World Programme of Action for Youth is the key\r\nword. We would therefore like to propose the following\r\nsix steps of action.\r\nAction One is this: think globally, act locally. These\r\nwords have been a key concept in talking about\r\nsustainable development. But thinking globally and acting\r\nlocally is just as central when talking about citizen\r\nparticipation in the work for human rights, social\r\ndevelopment and decision-making processes. Thus, to\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nmake young people become responsible citizens in society,\r\nGovernments should establish the structures and platforms\r\nneeded to ensure youth’s participation in decision-making\r\nprocesses and, furthermore, to ensure cooperation between\r\nyouth, independent youth organizations and governmental\r\nbodies. To put it in other words, there is a fundamental\r\nneed for all countries to create or improve a national youth\r\npolicy, one that allows young people to participate actively.\r\nTo come to Action Two, the draft World Programme\r\nof Action for Youth must be integrated into national youth\r\npolicy. This integration needs to be initiated immediately.\r\nThus, the United Nations should establish structures to\r\nensure and improve cooperation between national youth\r\nbodies, governmental structures and the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nNext, Action Three. The United Nations and Member\r\nStates should ensure the continued work of the World\r\nYouth Forum and the participation of international youth\r\norganizations on an equal basis. The World Youth Forum\r\ncan be seen as one of the basic tools for the process of\r\nimplementation of the draft World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth. Hence the United Nations and Member States\r\nshould ensure the financial support and funding of the\r\nForum.\r\nNow to Action Four. To ensure the implementation of\r\nthe programme I recommend that the General Assembly\r\ndesignate the United Nations youth unit as the secretariat\r\nfor this process. But for this to work successfully, there is\r\nan emerging need for a strengthened youth unit, renewed\r\nwith a strong and visible presence of young people and\r\nenhanced cooperation with international youth non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. In conjunction with this, I urge\r\nthe United Nations to ensure the continued financial\r\nfunding of the youth unit.\r\nRegarding Action Five, Young volunteers from\r\ninternational youth organizations should be sponsored to\r\nwork directly on the implementation of the draft World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth. Member States are urged\r\nto provide financial and moral support for such youth\r\nvolunteers.\r\nFinally, Action Six. This General Assembly is\r\ncelebrating the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\nYear and has put youth on the agenda. But very few\r\nGovernments have even thought about delegating youth to\r\nthe General Assembly. This is an embarrassing disregard of\r\nthe key persons. As a youth delegate to the General\r\nAssembly, it is therefore very important to me to encourage\r\nevery Member State to include youth delegates in their\r\nfuture delegations to the United Nations General\r\nAssembly and relevant United Nations bodies. This would\r\nbe an honourable action — an opinion turned into action.\r\nToday we live in a world of interdependence —\r\ncalled by some “the Global Village”. Any youth issue is\r\nclosely connected to the sustainable social development of\r\nthe world. This interdependence was clearly stated at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. Thus the full and\r\nvisionary follow-up on, and implementation of, the\r\ncommitment made at the Summit is fundamental to future\r\nprosperity, not only for the youth of today, but for all\r\nworld citizens.\r\nThe Danish author and Nobel Prize winner Johannes\r\nV. Jensen once said: “Youth is facing a double battle: the\r\nfight against itself and the fight against its elders. The\r\nlatter is the toughest”. May this quotation soon be history.\r\nThe youth of the world is ready to assume\r\nresponsibility and take part in the work for world social\r\ndevelopment. Action is our best expression of opinion.\r\nOur focus is action; our time is now.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call upon Mr. Ammar Saati, Vice-President of the\r\nNational Union of Syrian Students and Youth Delegate of\r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Saati (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): When the representatives of world\r\nGovernments meet at this high level to deliberate the\r\nrealities of youth and to formulate a plan of action to deal\r\nwith their problems over the coming period, such\r\nmeetings and deliberations bespeak great interest in the\r\nfuture of our peoples and of mankind in general.\r\nMoreover, the interest we take in reviewing our work in\r\nthis regard over the past decade expresses a collective\r\ndesire to surmount the most difficult obstacles that face\r\nyouth, especially as regards the possibilities of achieving\r\npeace through putting an end to all forms of colonialism\r\nand foreign occupation of the territories of others by force\r\nand the enablement of youth to exercise their right to\r\nestablish their own organizations, to obtain assistance in\r\nresolving their problems and their right to participate in\r\ndevelopment through the creation of working\r\nopportunities for their creative contributions which must,\r\nin the final analysis, benefit humanity and ensure a decent\r\nfuture for its youth.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic has always been among the\r\nStates that called for paying sufficient attention by the\r\nUnited Nations and its bodies to youth problems in various\r\nareas. The presence of representatives of Syria’s youth and\r\nstudents in Syria’s delegation to this meeting dedicated to\r\nthe commemoration of the tenth anniversary of International\r\nYouth Year, in addition to the fact that more than two\r\nthirds of the staff of our Permanent Mission to the United\r\nNations belong to the young generation, reflect the interest\r\nmy country takes in this social segment which was\r\ndescribed by President Hafez al-Assad as “the hope of the\r\npresent for the future and the hope of the future in the\r\npresent”. The interest Syria’s political system takes in youth\r\nis part and parcel of an integral strategy which deals with\r\nthe overall question of youth, taking into consideration the\r\nnature of our society and the tasks before it at this stage.\r\nSyria, as a developing country, aspires to achieve\r\ncomprehensive human development side by side with socio-\r\neconomic development. This calls for the mobilization of\r\nour people’s human potential, especially that of its youth.\r\nThe leadership of President Hafez al-Assad has\r\nensured for Syria, since 1970, the appropriate political\r\nstability and the democratic climate conducive to the widest\r\npossible popular participation. In this context, Syria’s youth\r\njoin non-governmental popular organizations that operate in\r\nfull freedom and contribute effectively to the progress of\r\nsociety. In this regard, the National Union of Syrian\r\nStudents is proud of the fact that President Hafez al-Assad\r\nwas the first President of a student conference held in\r\nSyria, on 30 March 1950. This Union embraces university\r\nyouth, students in postgraduate studies and students in\r\nhigher and intermediate institutes, represents them before\r\nthe various university boards, expresses their views on the\r\ncurricula, contributes to decision-making, defends the\r\ninterests and achievements of the students and helps to\r\nsolve any problems that may stand in the way of their\r\neducation and social activities. In the framework of this\r\nUnion, which includes forces from various political parties,\r\nthe students democratically elect their leaderships at various\r\nlevels in full freedom. To ensure the widest possible\r\neducational opportunities for young people in Syria,\r\neducation is free at the elementary, secondary, university\r\nand postgraduate levels. The State provides university\r\nresidence for students for token fees that amount to half a\r\nUnited States dollar per month. This fee covers full board,\r\nutilities and services. The National Union of Syrian\r\nStudents exercises its athletic, artistic, cultural, political and\r\nsocial activities in full freedom. It also organizes summer\r\nscientific camps, that embrace various disciplines, with the\r\naim of linking university education in a practical manner\r\nwith the life of society. In this regard, the Government\r\nprovides the material requirements of these camps.\r\nThe Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the\r\nyouth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and\r\nan educational forum for young people through which\r\nSyria’s youth exercise their its democratic rights, elect\r\ntheir political leaderships, practice their hobbies and\r\ndefend their interests at all levels: the educational, social,\r\neconomic, vocational, cultural, touristic, athletic, artistic,\r\ninformational, ideological, political and technical. The\r\nUnion’s membership is over one million-and-a-half young\r\npeople. Forty per cent of them are young girls. The\r\nRevolutionary Youth Movement is represented in the\r\nAdvisory Committees of the Council of Ministers which\r\ninclude: the Cultural Committee, the Planning Committee,\r\nthe Services Committee and the Illiteracy Eradication\r\nCommittee. The Union owns a touristic facility, two\r\nyouth towns, a sophisticated publishing and printing\r\nfacility; it runs more than 50 scientific clubs and\r\npublishes a youth newspaper.\r\nThe Union provides young people with educational\r\nopportunities through its support for Syrian schools, the\r\ndevelopment of the Syrian educational system and the\r\nenhancement of the educational standard of students. The\r\nGovernment of the Syrian Arab Republic highly values\r\nthe role played by the Union of Revolutionary Youth in\r\neradicating the illiteracy of thousands of citizens in\r\ncooperation with the Ministry of Culture in the context of\r\nthe campaign that aims at eradicating illiteracy before the\r\nyear 2000, in addition to other volunteer activities which\r\nreflect positively on the process of progress and\r\ndevelopment in our country.\r\nThe Athletic Federation basically oversees the young\r\npeople who have various athletic skills and hobbies. The\r\nState has built athletic facilities all over Syria which it\r\nplaced at the service of the youth of Syria with the aim of\r\nmaintaining the good physical health of young people and\r\nenhancing athletic cooperation with athletes all over the\r\nworld through participation in various international games\r\nwhere the champions of Syria have scored many victories.\r\nSeveral Government Ministries maintain close\r\nrelations with youth organizations in two areas, namely\r\nhealth education, especially with regard to the AIDS\r\ndisease and the prevention thereof, and the enhancement\r\nof environmental awareness to preserve the environment\r\nand reduce pollution. These organizations also organize\r\ncontinuous educational campaigns against smoking among\r\nyoung people, against the devastating scourge of drugs,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nand in the area of crime prevention. The Revolutionary\r\nYouth Movement maintains relations with the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the International\r\nFamily Planning Association, undertakes field studies and\r\norganizes educational campaigns that cover demographic\r\nconcepts, reproductive health and family planning.\r\nThe youth and students of Syria, nurtured as they are\r\nby the humanistic values of their nation, especially respect\r\nfor the values and customs of other peoples: justice,\r\nbrotherhood, equality and the promotion of the principles of\r\nunderstanding and tolerance and the renunciation of\r\nintolerance, racism and all forms of racial discrimination\r\nand xenophobia, also believe in the need for peace to\r\nprevail all over the world and the need for a universal\r\ncommitment to the principles and objectives of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. In this regard, they rally round the\r\nleadership of President Hafez al-Assad in order to achieve\r\na comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East region\r\non the basis of the principles upon which the Madrid\r\nConference was held in 1991, especially the principle of\r\nland for peace and the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and 425 (1978). To this\r\nend, it is incumbent upon Israel to withdraw immediately\r\nand in full from the Syrian Arab Golan to the line of\r\n4 June 1967 and from South Lebanon and to stop\r\nobstructing the peace process. In the light of the foregoing,\r\nthe strategy of the Syrian Arab Republic as regards youth\r\nis principally based on responding to their needs and to\r\ntheir aspirations in today’s society.\r\nThese programmes take into account the rights of\r\nyoung people, including the right to education — a right\r\nthat should be guaranteed by the State — the right to work,\r\nthe right to participate in national decision-making, the right\r\nto articulate aspirations and needs, the right to organize\r\nthemselves, the right to marriage and the right to housing.\r\nThese rights are to be exercised within the capabilities of\r\nthe State, as dictated by its by socio-economic\r\ncircumstances. The enablement to exercise those rights\r\nshould take place through economic, social, psychological,\r\neducational and rehabilitation programmes, as well as\r\nprogrammes of political and intellectual awareness.\r\nThe youth of the world, who are celebrating with their\r\npeoples the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, view\r\nwith hope our celebration of the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year as another advance in support of\r\nyouth, who represent the hope of achieving a world in\r\nwhich a just peace would prevail.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on The Honourable Algernon Allen, Minister\r\nof Youth and Culture of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Allen (Bahamas): In this year of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations Charter, it is vital that\r\nwe all recall the full terms of a resolution adopted on 18\r\nNovember 1985 by the General Assembly, acting as\r\nUnited Nations World Conference for the International\r\nYouth Year. Those terms, in full, called for participation,\r\ndevelopment and peace in the global thrust to deal\r\neffectively with youth, and five years ago the General\r\nAssembly further resolved that at the session marking the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations Charter a\r\nplenary meeting — this one — would be devoted\r\nexclusively to youth questions.\r\nGathered in this place are youth Ministers or other\r\nofficial representatives of the nearly 200 States Members\r\nof the United Nations, and I have no doubt that each of\r\nus has special and peculiar experience, viewpoint or\r\nnational report that can be of value to the international\r\neffort to save and promote the interests and development\r\nof young people.\r\nYet, irrespective of our individual contributions, and\r\nno matter what may be the characteristic programmes of\r\naction in our individual territories, we must all in this\r\nplace today accept and acknowledge that there is around\r\nthe world a supreme crisis of youth. It is a crisis which\r\nalmost daily hits the headlines of most of our local media;\r\nwhich brings pain and disarray to many of our traditional\r\nfamily lifestyles and structures; and which, in\r\nconsequence, affects the long-term national planning of\r\ntoo many countries. It is a crisis generally brought on by\r\nthe various afflictions of poverty, hunger, delinquency,\r\nunemployment, criminality, sexual promiscuity, fatal\r\ndiseases, illegitimacy, substance abuse and a general\r\ncondition of powerlessness. It is a crisis which no nation\r\nor community has effectively escaped, a crisis which has\r\nbeen exhaustively explored and analysed by our\r\nindividual countries and which we, through the\r\ninstrumentality of the United Nations and our peculiar\r\nnational inputs, can conquer through agreed guidelines\r\nand plans of action that may crystallize during this tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year.\r\nThese critical afflictions of youth in the Caribbean\r\nand in North and South America — as, perhaps, in\r\nEurope, Africa and parts of Asia — are particularly acute,\r\nand they invite a wider vision for a global remedy or, at\r\nleast, relief. The report of the West Indian Commission of\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\n1982 on social and economic issues of our region should\r\nsum up the resolute position of this special occasion when\r\nit states: “Now is the time for action”.\r\nOn this question of the world’s youth, we must adopt\r\nthe attitude of survival along lines of common effort and\r\ncombined strategies that we know can work. The ideal\r\nvenue for that common effort and those combined strategies\r\nis here at the United Nations.\r\nMy responsibility in the Commonwealth of the\r\nBahamas — a small but proud Member of this great\r\ninternational body — is to ensure the welfare, the progress\r\nand the future of our nation’s young people. Our Ministry\r\nof Youth and Culture, together with the Ministry of\r\nEducation, the police and the private sector, and armed with\r\nthe report of a blue-ribbon National Consultative Committee\r\non Youth — copies of which were distributed here\r\ntoday — has promoted a number of programmes designed\r\nto save and empower those young people yet within our\r\ngrasp and to rescue from disaster those who have slipped\r\nthrough the cracks. These programmes span the broad\r\nspectrum of vocational, cultural, sporting and character\r\ndevelopment. In the limited time available to me I shall\r\nmention but a few of them.\r\nWith the establishment of an industrial training\r\ncollege, we are effectively dealing with those young people\r\nwho, while they may not be academic stars, can be\r\nintegrated into the system through a sensible and practical\r\nprogramme of trade and vocational training.\r\nA “Let’s read, Bahamas” programme, instituted in\r\n1994, sought, and still seeks, to mobilize the interest of\r\ncitizens, particularly young people, in expanding their\r\nreading and interpretation abilities beyond the classroom\r\ncurriculum.\r\nThe Police Athletic League has been instituted, not\r\nsimply to develop sporting enthusiasm among young people\r\nbut, significantly, to teach and instil respect for the law, for\r\nauthority and for the rights of others.\r\nThe Organization of American States assisted in the\r\nfunding of, and is particularly impressed by and interested\r\nin, a pilot programme known as the Youth Enterprise\r\nProject, which is geared specifically towards unemployed\r\nschool-leavers, who, with some skills training and personal\r\ndevelopment, can be cultivated into areas of self-\r\nemployment. In that programme, which is tailor-made for\r\nmost similar developing communities, there is special\r\nemphasis on the empowerment of young women who have\r\nfallen foul of society and who must often fend for\r\nthemselves and their children. The private sector in the\r\nBahamas has contributed appreciably to this national\r\ntheme of youth salvation and development.\r\nThus it can be seen that we in the Commonwealth of\r\nthe Bahamas have kept this matter of youth development\r\nand empowerment constantly on the national front burner,\r\nespecially over the past three years when, all over the\r\nworld, the proper direction of young people entered a\r\nplateau of crisis. While we must, in our individual\r\ncountries, leave no stone unturned in finding solutions to\r\nour national and provincial problems with young people,\r\nthe United Nations too must assume a sense and an\r\nattitude of urgency on the matter of the world’s youth.\r\nThe United Nations has long accepted that there are\r\nno national boundaries in the areas of disease, famine,\r\npoverty, substance abuse, generic crime and crimes\r\nagainst humanity, yet it must also accept that many small\r\nand struggling States have no means of fighting these\r\nproblems alone and that in this year marking the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year it must assume a\r\nglorious role of leadership in this transnational battle to\r\nsave the world’s youth and, thereby, ensure a battalion of\r\ncapable leaders for tomorrow’s world.\r\nIn every nation, in every language and in every\r\nideological setting around the globe we use special terms\r\nof endearment when referring to young people — the\r\nbright tomorrows of our land. In recent years in the\r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas, we have referred to them\r\nas the “darlings” of the nation. Darlings, because they are\r\nintrinsically precious and fragile. Darlings, because they\r\nare proud extensions of ourselves, to whom we have a\r\ncommitment to make proud, independent, worthwhile and\r\nproductive citizens in their own right.\r\nI now speak to this body, for the darlings of all the\r\nnations of the world, when I say that, whatever else the\r\nUnited Nations does, it must ensure the banishment from\r\nour children of the scourges of deprivation, famine and\r\ndispossession which militate against orderly development\r\nin our respective countries.\r\nWe must never forget that the peace and the\r\nbrightness of tomorrow’s world depend upon these, our\r\nyouth, the most precious of our brethren, whom another\r\npromised would be greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of Romania,\r\nMr. Crapatureanu.\r\nMr. Crapatureanu (Romania): I have the privilege\r\nand honour to take the floor on behalf of His Excellency\r\nMr. Alexandru Mironov, Minister for Youth and Sports of\r\nRomania, who regrets his last-minute absence from this\r\nimportant gathering. I now proceed to present his statement.\r\n“It is with great pleasure that I wish to address\r\nmy most cordial greetings to the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations and, through my voice, to convey\r\nthe warm salute of over 5 million young people from\r\nRomania, who represent a quarter of the population of\r\nmy country.\r\n“Precisely 10 years ago, on Romania’s initiative,\r\nthe year 1985 was proclaimed “International Youth\r\nYear: Participation, Development, Peace”. The\r\nresolutions adopted by the United Nations General\r\nAssembly in November 1985 expressed the desire to\r\namplify the activities of all States at governmental and\r\nnon-governmental level in order to stimulate youth\r\nprogrammes and activities. They also underlined the\r\nnecessity to reinforce the efforts and the measures\r\ndirected to safeguarding the observance of human\r\nrights, in particular those related to education and\r\nwork, calling on national, regional and international\r\norganizations to support the global development of the\r\nyoung generation under the sign of understanding,\r\nprogress and friendship.\r\n“Over the years this call, addressed to a world\r\nundergoing continuous and rapid change, has not\r\nceased to be heard, even if the voice has sometimes\r\nbeen muted by political and economic circumstances,\r\nby wars and calamities, by social movements, and by\r\nwalls destroyed or raised. In spite of all of this, young\r\npeople have continued to fight and dream, to learn and\r\nprepare themselves for tomorrow when they will\r\nbecome responsible rulers of the world they will build.\r\n“I am happy to share with you, as Minister for\r\nYouth and Sports, but also as a person whose entire\r\ncareer has been very closely linked with various issues\r\nrelated to youth, the experience I have gained during\r\nthese last two years of activity for the young and\r\ntogether with the young. They are the ones who will\r\ndetermine the quality leap required for the change in\r\nmentality of a people that, for 6 years now, has been\r\nexperiencing other fundamental and dramatic changes.\r\nThe concepts that I consider most important in this\r\ncontext are: permanent education, modular\r\nqualification and continuous training, promotion of\r\nthe value of and respect for work, faith in tradition\r\nand trust in the future.\r\n“These objectives are found in the specific\r\nyouth policies that we have shaped and defined\r\nwithin the programmes pursued by the Ministry of\r\nYouth and Sports, the so-called “national\r\nprogrammes”. Among them, may I recall the\r\nfollowing: Civilization of the 21st Century\r\n(stimulation and education of creativity in the field\r\nof science and technology); ABC in Culture (youth\r\ncultural education); STYLE (education in behaviour,\r\nhygiene and health); Active Holidays (leisure-time\r\neducation); Where To? (continuous education);\r\nS.O.S. for Youth (social assistance); The Young\r\nFarmer (reinvigoration of the Romanian village);\r\nTogether (stimulation of the associative life);\r\nINFOTIN (establishment of a network of youth\r\ninformation and documentation centres); Clean Our\r\nCountry (ecological education and training); Moralia\r\n(moral and religious education); and Romania in\r\nTomorrow’s World (international relations and youth\r\nexchanges) and the UNESCO-Open University\r\nproject Youth in Evolution\u0027.\r\n“Within this last programme, in 1994 and 1995,\r\nover 2,000 young people — academic winners of\r\nnational and international contests on education\r\nsubjects — have had the opportunity to visit Europe,\r\nAmerica and Asia on study travel organized by our\r\nMinistry, with significant support from Romanian\r\nsociety. I am convinced that, for our young\r\ninternational champions, this travel was a beautiful\r\nlesson on cultures and civilizations, and on the\r\nuniversal language of youth, knowledge, friendship\r\nand peace.\r\n“We wish that all young people could carry\r\nforward the message of understanding and\r\ninvolvement in building the world of the third\r\nmillennium. We wish that the world’s cultural,\r\nscientific and technical heritage could become a link\r\nin international dialogue and that reason could\r\ntriumph on the “blue planet”. We wish that the\r\npeoples of the world could measure the force of\r\ntheir minds or bodies in keeping with the classic,\r\nancient adage “citius, altius, fortius” on all sports\r\nfields, without violence, in the spirit of fair play and\r\nunder the sign of unity through diversity. Then, for\r\nsure, the United Nations could become what all\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 October 1995\r\ndreamers hope it will be: a real parliament of all\r\nnations on Earth.”\r\nBefore concluding, on behalf of my delegation I\r\nwould like to make two brief remarks. Firstly, we\r\nsincerely hope that the draft World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth will be adopted by consensus by the General\r\nAssembly. It represents a most useful policy framework\r\nand it also contains practical guidelines for the\r\nimprovement of the situation of youth all over the world.\r\nSecondly, as one of the initiators of items regarding the\r\nstatus of youth, the delegation of Romania considers that\r\nthe goals of International Youth Year are as valid today\r\nas they were a decade ago. In this respect, we consider\r\nthat the adoption of the pertinent resolution on the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond will contribute to further promoting the\r\naspirations of young people to fully participate in, and to\r\nactively contribute to, the betterment of our societies.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
