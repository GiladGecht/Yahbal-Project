(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Kittikhoun (Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic People’s Republic), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 105 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family\r\nCommemoration to mark the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThis morning, the General Assembly will hold the third of\r\nits plenary meetings devoted to marking the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year.\r\nI now call on Ms. Adelina Covo de Guerrero, Vice-\r\nMinister for Youth of Colombia.\r\nMs. Covo de Guerrero (Colombia) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I have the honour to address the General\r\nAssembly on behalf of the Colombian Government and the\r\nIbero-American Youth Organization and, first of all, to\r\ntransmit the greetings of Colombia’s young people and their\r\nconcern for promoting the policies needed for the\r\nharmonious development of Latin America’s young people\r\nand the world’s.\r\nWe can only be gratified by the demanding\r\nenvironment of this summit, which is in harmony with the\r\ncurrent phase of development challenges and the gravity\r\nof the issues that are now being tackled by the countries\r\nof the world.\r\nThe best occasion to redefine the new directions\r\ntaken by countries in search of development, peace and\r\nequality is that which is offered today by the United\r\nNations on its fiftieth anniversary, which has struggled\r\ntirelessly for a better world Organization and has made\r\nefforts creatively readapt its policies to the new realities\r\nthat prevail in modern society.\r\nDrawing closer to the realities with which the\r\nworld’s young people live and identifying our\r\nresponsibilities and our role in resolving the various\r\nissues that confront us represent perhaps the most\r\nimportant challenges of this great event.\r\nIt should be the constant preoccupation of\r\nGovernments to devote the necessary importance and\r\npriority to the needs of young people.\r\nIn Latin America, young people are an object of\r\ngreat concern. In our continent we have more than 90\r\nmillion people aged 15 to 24, a number which will grow\r\nto 105 million by the year 2000. This challenge has both\r\nrural and urban dimensions; 63 million of these\r\nyoungsters live in the cities, and 27 million in the\r\ncountryside. Among urban youth, the working class, now\r\nnumbering 25 million persons, is of particular\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nsignificance. Together with the 11 million rural poor, there\r\nare 36 million young people living in poverty, a figure\r\nwhich will grow to 42 million if the trend is not reversed.\r\nYoung women constitute an important part of\r\nsubgroups among the young, and their presence will be\r\neven greater in the urban environment, particularly in the\r\nworking class.\r\nThis situation, like that of the migratory movements of\r\nthe youth population in the region, are of great concern. But\r\nI wish to draw particular attention to the condition of\r\ninequality that affects the youth population. This reality has\r\nbeen characterized by taking into account criteria such as\r\nthe poverty line according to young people’s income levels,\r\ntheir purchasing power and their access to social goods and\r\nservices.\r\nColombia’s young population represents 27 per cent of\r\nthe total population of the country, or about 10 million\r\nColombians. Of these, 67 per cent live in urban centres and\r\n33 per cent in rural zones. Approximately 45 per cent of\r\nColombia’s young people live in poverty which, for 18 per\r\ncent, is extreme. This serious situation is manifest in the\r\nincreasing restriction of opportunities for effective social\r\nintegration for youth in national development.\r\nAgain, figures enable us to describe this situation.\r\nAlthough in Colombia great efforts have been made in\r\norder to extend secondary school availability, only 47 per\r\ncent of the population of student age have access to the\r\neducation system.\r\nThere are similar problems with the access of young\r\npeople to the labour market. In general, the integration of\r\nyouth into the world of work is characterized by high\r\nunemployment levels — more than twice that of the\r\nnational average — resulting from the prolonged search for\r\nwork by young people entering employment for the first\r\ntime. These levels are higher for young people from low-\r\nincome families.\r\nThis situation is aggravated by the paucity of official\r\nassistance available to young people, which is indicated by\r\nthe fact that the population sector aged 12-24 does not\r\nconstitute for government agencies a clearly defined social\r\nsector as a beneficiary of programmes and services.\r\nOwing to the specific historical conditions of our\r\nsociety, we can say that it is among the young that all the\r\nfactors of violence are most dramatically condensed and\r\nexpressed, making young people the protagonists of\r\nscenarios of greater conflict. Sadly, in our country, injury\r\nand violence are the main factors of morbidity and\r\nmortality among young men.\r\nNarcotics trafficking and its social, economic and\r\ncultural impact on the young are matters of great concern\r\nfor the Government and society of my country. This\r\nimpact can be seen in high drug consumption rates, the\r\nstimulus to illicit riches, the participation of young people\r\nin illegal drug production, cultivation and marketing, the\r\ninvolvement of young people in violent systems and\r\nactivities such as assassination, or the economic support\r\nprovided by speculative drug capital, which discourages\r\na culture of productive labour and stimulates violence. As\r\na result, some 50 per cent of the persons accused of\r\ncrimes in our country are young citizens.\r\nThere are, however, areas in which young people are\r\nmaking proposals and in which they are positive social\r\nactors. We have found great efforts being made by youth\r\ngroups and organizations engaged in the search for the\r\nsocial and political recognition to which they are entitled,\r\nand for effective integration into national development.\r\nThese efforts are often ignored by society, and have no\r\nimpact beyond the immediate neighbourhood or frame of\r\nreference.\r\nIt is for these reasons that addressing the problem of\r\novercoming poverty and the drugs issue, with young\r\npeople as the primary object, our major preoccupation as\r\na Government is to bring the general proposals of the\r\nNational Development Plan creatively into line with the\r\nspecific needs of Colombian youth.\r\nThe “Social Jump”, the National Development Plan\r\nof the Government of President Ernesto Samper, the\r\ncollaborative product of all Colombia’s active social\r\ncircles in search of a great domestic commitment to the\r\npresent and the future, thus fulfilling the mandate of our\r\npolitical Constitution.\r\nAs an integral part of the “Social Jump”, the\r\nMinister of National Education, in collaboration with the\r\nproject Education: A National Proposal, is coordinating a\r\ndeliberation and discussion process which, through\r\nseminars, assemblies, workshops and other means of\r\ndiscussion and negotiation culminating in regional forums,\r\nwill lead to national consensus on the National Accord for\r\nEducation. All those who participate in the local and\r\nregional forums and in the education departmental boards\r\nwill be able to participate in the 10-year education plan.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nThe objective of the 10-year plan is to construct, with\r\npublic participation, a longer-term education policy defining\r\nnorms and agreeing on educational goals and purposes for\r\nthe next 10 years. It will take into account prior national\r\nand regional consultations with trade unionists, teachers,\r\nstudents, parents, business leaders and governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations. We will involve the whole\r\ncountry in converting education into a goal shared by all.\r\nFrom that deliberation, there should emerge very concrete\r\ncommitments in each sector, which should respond to youth\r\nin this important area of development.\r\nThe Vice-Ministry for Youth, which coordinates\r\nColombia’s Youth Policy with the current Government’s\r\nsocial policy, sees young people as political and social\r\nbeings with rights and duties. For this reason, the\r\nMinistry’s work focuses on the consolidation of young\r\npeople’s full exercise of their citizenship and the\r\ndevelopment of public policies aimed at guaranteeing that\r\ntheir needs are met and their interests given voice. In this\r\nregard, the guidelines of the Youth Policy of President\r\nSamper’s Government are oriented towards guaranteeing\r\ncomprehensive attention to the population of young people,\r\nintersectoral action by the State, specially designed policies\r\nand programmes, promotional actions founded on the\r\nstrategic potential of youth in the area of development, the\r\ndiversity of young people’s world as a guide for\r\nestablishing legitimate policies and the constant search in\r\nall our work for equity between male and female.\r\nThe Vice-Ministry for Youth focuses its actions on\r\ntwo central areas: integration and development of\r\nprogrammes for the young sector of the population, aimed\r\nat the implementation of social policy in areas such as\r\neducation, health, recreation and sports, culture,\r\nemployment and housing; and the consolidation of support\r\nprogrammes for regional institutional development, the\r\norganization and participation of young people,\r\ndevelopment of legislation and specific programmes for\r\npreventing problems such as drug addiction, AIDS, juvenile\r\ndelinquency and violence.\r\nFive years before the end of the century, new\r\ngenerations are living in a world full of international\r\ninformation. In this information framework, cooperation is\r\na factor in knowledge, culture and peace, and today it must\r\nmove ahead as a factor in the training of youth from all\r\ncontinents, as well as in meetings and exchanges between\r\nLatin American youths and those of other continents and\r\nbetween youths of the various countries of our continent.\r\nWithin this framework of initiatives, the actions we\r\nhave been developing with the Latin American Youth\r\nOrganization have been integrated with regional\r\nprogrammes of action for the development of youth in\r\nLatin America. The priority areas being addressed include\r\neducation, employment and job training, health,\r\nparticipation and public institutions, integration and\r\nregional cooperation. Also, in conjunction with the\r\nNational Youth Institute of Chile and under the umbrella\r\nof the Latin American Youth Organization, we have\r\nproposed to implement training schools for local youth\r\nagents in order to build a common framework for the\r\noperation of programmes and policies aimed at youth.\r\nOvercoming barriers in economy, science and\r\ntechnology helps everyone, but especially young people.\r\nThe same holds true for culture, and despite all the\r\ndifferences between countries and continents and the\r\nuniqueness of each one, there is much in common\r\nbetween life in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe and\r\nAmerica.\r\nConsolidating the common features and deepening\r\nour understanding of what binds us together, thus\r\nexpanding the exchange of cultural values between youths\r\nof different countries and continents, is a task that is not\r\nonly feasible, but also essential in order to build of a\r\nmore harmonious and unified planet for the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We in Colombia dream of a just and prosperous\r\nworld, a world within the reach of children and youths.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI wish to call the attention of all members to the fact that\r\nwe have a long list of speakers. None the less, owing to\r\nthe grave financial situation of the United Nations, the\r\nafternoon meeting must be adjourned at 6 p.m. I therefore\r\nappeal to all speakers to be brief so that all the\r\nparticipants, some of whom have come here especially for\r\nthis occasion, can speak within the time allocated for\r\ntoday’s meetings.\r\nI now call on the representative of Canada,\r\nMs. Isabelle Poupart, Youth Delegate.\r\nMs. Poupart (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year, I\r\nhave the privilege and pleasure to share with the General\r\nAssembly some of Canada’s perspectives and policies on\r\nyouth issues.\r\nSince International Youth Year, 10 years ago, we\r\nhave witnessed significant progress. More children now\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nsurvive to become healthy adults: we have halved the rate\r\nof infant mortality, and we are on the verge of eradicating\r\nsome of the diseases that most threaten children’s health.\r\nNone the less, young people face challenges that did\r\nnot exist 10 years ago. The world’s population is currently\r\ngrowing by about 90 million annually, and between 1995\r\nand 2015 approximately 1.847 billion additional children\r\nand young people will be added to the population of the\r\nEarth. This means there will be a dizzying increase in the\r\nnumber of young people in need of education, training, jobs\r\nand a future.\r\nOn top of that, we are living in a period of dramatic\r\ntransformation in the world of work. Young people today\r\nare being called upon to adapt more rapidly than ever\r\nbefore to changes on political, economic and social fronts.\r\nChange has become our collective constant. This reality\r\nputs enormous pressure on young people the world over,\r\nwho are expected to prepare for a future that even futurists\r\nare unable to foresee.\r\nCanada considers that the international community\r\nmust do more to respond to the needs of youth, particularly\r\ntheir special needs in making the transition from school to\r\nwork. We must pay more attention to education and\r\ntraining for those who will be entering the work force in\r\nthe next 20 to 30 years.\r\nThe Rio Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, the\r\nCairo Conference on Population and Development and the\r\nBeijing Conference on Women all addressed very serious\r\nissues facing youth. In the coordinated follow-up to those\r\nConferences, neither Governments nor the United Nations\r\nmust forget the importance we attach to issues affecting\r\nyoung people. My country hopes that the Commission for\r\nSocial Development will continue to play a key role in this\r\nregard and that it will provide a forum for addressing youth\r\nissues, that it will further the study of the situation of the\r\nyoung and, above all, that it will collect, synthesize and\r\nrefine societal indicators of their situation.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nYoung people are the world’s finest resource. We\r\nbring to life and to work ideas and energy, innovation and\r\nhope, dreams and ambitions. Countries, supported by the\r\ninternational community, must create an enabling\r\nenvironment in which we may meet our potential and\r\nparticipate in our countries’ development. In particular there\r\nis a need to focus on the many barriers to full equality\r\nfaced by young women.\r\nIf our hopes and dreams are betrayed, then we may\r\nsee significant increases in poverty, unemployment and\r\nmarginalization among the young, problems that can\r\nresult in crime, substance abuse and domestic instability.\r\nWe also recognize that far too many young people today\r\ndie in wars or suffer as refugees or displaced persons.\r\nIn Canada, we recognize a responsibility to help\r\nguide young people through these turbulent times. But we\r\nrealize that this is not something government can do\r\nalone. We are firm believers in the power of partnerships,\r\nconvinced that it takes the commitment and cooperation\r\nof parents, educators, employers and young people to\r\nmeet the challenge.\r\nIn Canada, our vision stems from the simple but\r\nprofound philosophy that everyone should have safe\r\nhomes and safe streets, full employment opportunities,\r\nand fair and equitable treatment at home, at school and on\r\nthe job.\r\nCanada believes it is essential that young people be\r\nable to become participants and contributors to society. In\r\nCanada we help equip young people with skills, and help\r\nopen the doors to free and full participation by young\r\npeople in our country’s future.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Government of Canada has initiated policies and\r\ninstituted a series of youth initiatives aimed at\r\nempowering young Canadians to discover their own\r\npotential to be part of the solution, so they can face the\r\nfuture with confidence. Before establishing these\r\nprogrammes, the Government consulted extensively with\r\nyouth. Based on that input, the Government developed its\r\nYouth Employment and Learning Strategy. Its main\r\ncomponents include Youth Service Canada, Youth\r\nInternship Canada, Student Summer Job Action and the\r\nCanada Student Loans Programme.\r\nWe are also proud of our efforts to help youth at the\r\ninternational level. Canada initiated the World Youth\r\nLeadership Training Summit, held here at the United\r\nNations last summer. That summit provided youth from\r\naround the world the chance to come together and to\r\nfocus, as agents of change, on their responsibilities and\r\ngoals. In this context, we will welcome enthusiastically\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nnew initiatives on youth within the United Nations system\r\nand on the part of the relevant institutions.\r\nCanada endeavours to offer meaningful educational\r\nand work opportunities to young people so that they may\r\ncontribute to the workplace, the community, our country\r\nand soon, we hope, to the United Nations. By engaging\r\nCanada’s young people in learning and work experiences,\r\nwe are forming solid citizens who will be able to work for\r\nour country’s — and this planet’s — future. We are\r\ndeveloping the workforce necessary to meet the challenges\r\nof a global economy, and producing the next generation of\r\nnational and international leaders, parents and citizens. At\r\nthe root of that revolution are teenagers and young adults\r\nwho are turning the tide, working for a better tomorrow.\r\nThis celebration of the world’s youth is confirmation\r\nthe revolution has begun. Building on this momentum —\r\nperson by person, country by country — we will\r\nundoubtedly recreate our global community in a way that\r\nnot only mirrors our own dreams and hopes, but achieves\r\nour vision for our youth and our future.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Permanent Representative of Peru,\r\nMr. Guillén.\r\nMr. Guillén (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOver the last 10 years, the objectives of International Youth\r\nYear have not changed. However, owing to political,\r\neconomic, social and cultural changes, the relevant needs\r\nand interests are now different.\r\nMy delegation is aware that the best way of\r\ncelebrating the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\nYear would have been to adopt the draft World Programme\r\nof Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, a\r\ndocument being drafted through negotiations held within the\r\nframework of the Commission for Social Development and\r\nalso through a Working Group of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. We believe that the adoption of this document\r\nshould strengthen international commitment for its full\r\nimplementation.\r\nIn Peru, 43 per cent of the population is made up of\r\nyoung people and children, and we therefore accord them\r\na very special priority.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that the priority areas\r\nidentified by the international community in the draft\r\nProgramme of Action that we hope soon to adopt coincide\r\nwith the specific objectives, strategies and actions of the\r\nyouth programme of the national plan for the population\r\nof Peru for the years 1991-1996.\r\nThat programme’s general objective is to promote\r\nprojects and comprehensive actions for Peruvian youth,\r\nmainly in the fields of responsible sexuality, education for\r\npeace, prevention of drug abuse, employment counselling\r\nand the creation of jobs.\r\nIn Peru, in order to achieve the general objective of\r\nthe youth programme, the following three strategies have\r\nbeen considered, to be carried out with the active\r\nparticipation of young people: first, the establishment of\r\na multisectoral, high-level commission made up of\r\nrepresentatives of the public administration, of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and of youth entrusted with\r\nthe coordination, follow-up and evaluation of the national\r\nprogramme; secondly, priority actions directed at\r\nadolescents and young men and women in the poorest\r\nareas, who run the highest risk of violence and premature\r\npregnancy; and, thirdly, encouraging the participation of\r\nyouth organizations in fostering and carrying out\r\nprogrammes for youth, as well as the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the development of projects\r\nfor the prevention of sexual violence against children.\r\nThe specific objectives of Peru’s youth programme\r\nare the following: first, to improve the sexual and\r\nreproductive health of youth and reduce the rate of\r\npregnancy and maternal mortality among adolescents;\r\nsecondly, to improve access to employment and income-\r\ngenerating opportunities for young people; thirdly, to\r\npromote the elaboration and execution of strategies to\r\nreduce and eliminate sexual violence against youth;\r\nfourthly, to promote the creation of youth organizations,\r\nwhich would make it possible for youths to be active in\r\nthe policies and programmes that concern them; and,\r\nfifthly, to improve educational strategies and subject\r\nmatter for youth. With regard to education, it is important\r\nnot only to improve the level of basic education, literacy\r\nand technical and professional training, but also to\r\npromote mutual understanding and the ideals of peace and\r\ntolerance among youth.\r\nIn that connection, and on this particular occasion,\r\nwhen, in accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n49/244, we are commemorating the World Week of\r\nPeace, Peru would like to stress the need for States that\r\nhave signed the Charter of the United Nations to\r\nrecognize that promoting a culture of peace is part of the\r\nresponsibility envisaged in it.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nIn this regard, States Members of the United Nations\r\nshould, in our own countries, encourage the promotion of\r\nan education for peace, designed to foster among children\r\nand young people a spirit of peace, tolerance, mutual\r\nrespect and understanding among nations.\r\nIn the future, an international society that has values\r\nsuch as the desire for peace, tolerance, solidarity and\r\nrespect towards others will be better equipped for social\r\ndevelopment without barriers, which is something we all\r\nseek.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of Mozambique,\r\nMrs. Gustava.\r\nMrs. Gustava (Mozambique): It is an honour and a\r\nprivilege for me to address this body as we celebrate the\r\ntenth anniversary of International Youth Year. My\r\ndelegation attaches great importance to this occasion and\r\nwe wish, therefore, to express our sincere appreciation and\r\npay homage to all those men and women dedicated to\r\nbuilding a world of hope and prosperity for young people.\r\nNeedless to say, a better future for succeeding\r\ngenerations depends upon the resources a society can invest\r\nin its young people in all critical areas that lead to the\r\nsustained social development of mankind.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of International Youth Year is\r\nyet another golden opportunity for us to reflect and reaffirm\r\nour commitment to work together to seek common\r\nsolutions to collective problems affecting young people\r\nthroughout the world. The overwhelming presence here this\r\nweek of Heads of State or Government and other important\r\ndignitaries who took part in the commemoration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations bears testimony\r\nto the firm determination of all nations of the world to\r\nwork together in matters of mutual concern.\r\nIt is gratifying that these celebrations come after a\r\nseries of important gatherings at the highest level which\r\nhave taken place in recent years. In those gatherings\r\nimportant decisions have been made by the Commission for\r\nSocial Development in critical areas identified as high\r\npriority in document E/CN.5/1995/9.\r\nIndeed, it is clear in our minds that, if we are to\r\nsucceed with the draft World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, we will need to adopt\r\nand take stock of equally important declarations and\r\nprogrammes of action adopted at previous forums. We fully\r\nsupport the draft World Programme of Action. It is our\r\nview that this programme represents a backdrop for the\r\nimprovement of the deteriorating situation of young\r\npeople across the world. It provides the practical\r\nguidelines, as well as the mechanisms, to promote and\r\nimprove the well-being and livelihood of youth.\r\nThe majority of the world’s youth population lives\r\nin developing countries, and the fate of young people in\r\nmany of those countries makes it even harder for them to\r\nbuild their future because of the limited opportunities for\r\neducation, training for viable employment, access to\r\nhealth and social services, among other factors.\r\nIn this context, it is legitimate that priority should be\r\ngiven to those countries, by providing them with adequate\r\nresources to enable them to implement specific\r\nprogrammes related to youth. Both individual countries\r\nand the international community at large bear the\r\nresponsibility of ensuring the removal of the root causes\r\nof social degradation affecting young people as a result of\r\nfrustration and lack of encouragement to confront the\r\nchallenges of their future.\r\nOf particular concern, also, is the phenomenon of\r\nuse of young people in armed conflicts. Indeed, my\r\nGovernment persistently denounced this practice during\r\nthe conflict in Mozambique. Today, the consequences of\r\nwar are enormous and the price stands high in terms of\r\nour ability to create the necessary conditions for the social\r\nreintegration of young people into civilian life.\r\nSixteen years of protracted war in Mozambique\r\nmeant 16 years of economic and social disruption of the\r\ncountry with regard to health, education, employment and\r\nother related problems. As President Chissano said in his\r\naddress at the Special Commemorative Meeting for the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations:\r\n“The unflinching will of the Mozambican people to\r\nconsolidate peace and democracy must be\r\ncomplemented by the creation of adequate conditions\r\nfor rebuilding the socio-economic fabric severely\r\naffected by 16 years of war.” (Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 40th meeting, p. 17)\r\nAs President Chissano has said, the Government’s\r\nFive-Year Programme addresses these challenges. The\r\nProgramme is aimed at ensuring the consolidation of\r\npeace and stability, democracy, and national unity,\r\nreducing the levels of absolute poverty and improving the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nliving standards of the people, with greater emphasis on\r\neducation, health, rural development, promotion of\r\nemployment and de-mining.\r\nWe are working closely with the international\r\ncommunity in different areas of social integration with a\r\nview to creating jobs in rural areas where the majority of\r\nthe young people live.\r\nMy Government is committed to pursuing these\r\nefforts, and we look forward to continued support from the\r\ninternational community for the success of the draft World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of China, Mr. Wang\r\nXuexian.\r\nMr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): It may be more appropriate for a young man than\r\na grey-haired man like me to make this statement, but I\r\nalso have reason to do so. First, I was once young. Second,\r\nI have always loved young people. I am deeply convinced\r\nof the irrefutable truth of what the late Chairman Mao\r\nZedong said in those days to China’s youth:\r\n“The world is yours as well as ours, but in the final\r\nanalysis it is yours. You, the young people, in the\r\nprime of life and full of vitality, are like the rising\r\nmorning sun at eight or nine o’clock. The hope is on\r\nyou.”\r\nIt is a major event in the field of youth that, at the\r\ntime of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we\r\nare gathered here to commemorate the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year, to take stock of the United\r\nNations’ efforts in youth-related areas, to discuss important\r\nglobal programmes for the work of youth to the year 2000\r\nand beyond, and to designate a date for International Youth\r\nDay. This demonstrates the great expectations of the\r\ninternational community from youth and the importance it\r\nattaches to the issue of youth. We would like to express our\r\nsupport and congratulations to this meeting.\r\nThe year 1985 was designated International Youth\r\nYear. Since then, great and profound changes have taken\r\nplace on the international scene, and these changes have\r\ncreated good opportunities for promoting our efforts in the\r\nfield of youth. The United Nations has done much useful\r\nwork in pushing youth activities in a more pragmatic\r\ndirection, and Member States have made great efforts\r\ncentred on the theme of “participation, development and\r\npeace” as adopted for International Youth Year. The issue\r\nof youth has aroused increasing attention from the\r\ninternational community, activities aimed at solving social\r\nproblems faced by youth have been on the rise, and\r\nefforts by different countries in this regard have made\r\nprogress in varying degrees.\r\nHowever, from a global point of view, the view of\r\nthe issue of youth as marginal has not fundamentally\r\nchanged. The extent of youth’s participation in social,\r\neconomic and cultural activities is far from satisfactory.\r\nIn many countries and regions, social problems such as\r\npoor education, unemployment, disease, poverty, drug\r\nabuse and crime are multiplying. It is very disturbing that\r\narmed conflicts, natural disasters and social problems\r\nhave driven large numbers of young people in certain\r\nregions to flee their homeland, thus worsening their living\r\nconditions. The issue of youth remains a weak link in the\r\nchain of the social development efforts of the United\r\nNations. The treatment it receives is far from equal to\r\nother fields of social development, and falls far short of\r\nthe demands of the international community. It is\r\ntherefore necessary for the international community to\r\nmake fresh efforts in the face of new situations and\r\nchallenges.\r\nAt present, the gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries in terms of wealth is widening. A\r\nvast number of developing countries are faced with a host\r\nof problems such as poverty, backwardness and lack of\r\nfunds, which directly affect the development and\r\nparticipation of their young people. Young people in\r\ndeveloping countries make up 80 per cent of the world’s\r\ntotal. A good solution to the problems they face would\r\ngive great impetus to overall progress on youth issues and\r\ncontribute to the cause of global social development. The\r\nUnited Nations, and the international community as a\r\nwhole, should therefore put the emphasis of their youth\r\nwork on developing countries, attach due importance to\r\nthe special difficulties and real needs of young people in\r\ndeveloping countries and assist developing countries in\r\ncarrying out positive and pragmatic youth programmes.\r\nThe budget for youth activities within the United Nations\r\nsystem should be increased accordingly.\r\nThe Chinese Government has always supported and\r\ntaken an active part in international activities in the field\r\nof youth. Ten years ago, the Chinese Government hosted\r\nthe Friendly Gathering of Youth in the Asian and Pacific\r\nRegion. This year, China presented to the United Nations\r\nposters for the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nYear. Not long ago, the All-China Youth Federation\r\nsuccessfully held in Beijing the East Asian Youth Leaders\r\nConference. We also actively participated in the preparation\r\nof the draft World Programme of Action for Youth to the\r\nYear 2000 and Beyond and have made vigorous efforts\r\nwith other countries in refining the Programme.\r\nWe believe that the draft World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, which basically\r\nreflects the actual situation of current world youth affairs,\r\nis of positive significance to the development of world\r\nyouth affairs beyond this century. Its adoption will help\r\nsolve the problems faced by young people in various\r\nenvironments, create conditions for their full and effective\r\nparticipation in social development and decision-making in\r\nvarious countries, increase their access to education, health\r\ncare and employment, protect them from the danger of\r\ndrugs, encourage them to participate actively in\r\nenvironmental protection and other social activities, and\r\npromote mutual understanding and mutual respect among\r\nyoung people of different racial, religious and cultural\r\nbackgrounds so that they can enjoy and cherish peace.\r\nTherefore, the Chinese Government supports the\r\nadoption of the draft Programme of Action at the current\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. We hope\r\nthat all countries will take practical and effective measures\r\nearnestly and effectively to implement the Programme of\r\nAction in line with the actual conditions and needs of their\r\nyoung people, and will strengthen their cooperation and\r\ntheir exchanges in this regard. We also hope that the United\r\nNations and the international community will play an active\r\nrole in implementing the Programme of Action, promote\r\nand carry out the youth-related programmes of the United\r\nNations system, strengthen coordination, expand technical\r\ncooperation, provide the necessary resources, and inject\r\nnew vitality into global youth work so as to advance it to\r\na new stage.\r\nThe Chinese Government has always attached\r\nimportance to youth work and has formulated and\r\nimplemented a series of policies concerning the protection\r\nand training of young people. There are explicit provisions\r\nconcerning youth policy in China’s Constitution and in\r\nrelevant laws, the central purpose of which is to protect the\r\nrights and interests of young people, facilitate their\r\ndevelopment, and encourage them to take an active part in\r\npolitical, economic and social development. To protect the\r\nrights of minors, the Minors Protection Law of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China came into effect in January 1992.\r\nAccordingly, local governments throughout the country\r\nhave also promulgated laws and regulations for the\r\nprotection of minors. In recent years, the Chinese\r\nGovernment and youth organizations have carried out, in\r\nthe light of China’s actual conditions, a great variety of\r\nnational and local activities focusing on the theme of\r\ngoing beyond the century such as the Youth Civilization\r\nProject Beyond the Century and the Youth Talents Project\r\nBeyond the Century. They have also formulated one\r\ntheme of China’s Agenda 21 programme: youth\r\nparticipation in sustainable development.\r\nBy participating actively in the nation’s political,\r\neconomic and social activities, young people in China\r\nhave already become a very important force in national\r\ndevelopment. Their representatives are participating in\r\ndecision-making in the Government and People’s\r\nCongresses at all levels. In response to the poverty-relief\r\nactivities advocated by the Government, young people in\r\nChina have set up 10 million small farms, timberland\r\ncentres, pastures, orchards and mills throughout the\r\ncountry. They have established the Youth Development\r\nFoundations of China, set up the first fund for assisting\r\ndrop-outs to return to school in poverty-stricken areas,\r\nand taken an active part in environmental protection\r\nactivities and in voluntary tree-planting and “Greenland”\r\nprojects. Youth centres have also been established in\r\naccordance with the special characteristics and needs of\r\nyoung people. Now there are in China 40,000 youth\r\nhomes, more than 1,100 youth palaces and more than 100\r\nyouth publications and periodicals. Psychological\r\ncounselling centres have been set up in most universities,\r\ncolleges and high schools. Rehabilitation centres have\r\nbeen established for the young disabled across the\r\ncountry, and cultural facilities for young people in China\r\nhave been greatly improved.\r\nChina has about 600 million young people, who are\r\nits most valuable asset. China is shouldering the heavy\r\nresponsibility of fostering a quarter of the world’s young\r\npeople. The Chinese Government will make further\r\nefforts in the field of youth, carry out, in light of its\r\nactual conditions, the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, take an active part\r\nin United Nations activities in the field of youth, and\r\nstrengthen its exchanges and cooperation with other\r\ncountries so as to contribute to the sound development of\r\nglobal youth affairs.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nMrs. Annette des Iles.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nMrs. des Iles (Trinidad and Tobago): Earlier this\r\nweek, Heads of State and Government from around the\r\nworld met in this Hall to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. They reflected on the\r\nactivities of the United Nations since 1945 and spoke of\r\ntheir future aspirations for this noble Organization. It is\r\nsignificant that on the heels of this historic event, the\r\nGeneral Assembly is convening to commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year, because the future\r\nof our world will be determined in large measure by the\r\nvision, hope and ideals of our young people, and the way\r\nin which the problems facing them are addressed.\r\nThere is no genius like the genius that resides in the\r\nenergy and creativity of youth. Young people have the\r\nability to make a dynamic and positive contribution in\r\ntoday’s world. They will be the ones to succeed us, and to\r\nassume important decision-making positions in the years\r\nahead. It is incumbent upon us, therefore, to invest\r\njudiciously and generously in today’s young men and\r\nwomen, remembering that they constitute a significant\r\ngroup in the population of many of our countries. In my\r\nown country, for instance, young people represent no less\r\nthan one sixth of the total population.\r\nThere are certain major areas of concern to youth\r\nworldwide. These include employment opportunities,\r\neducation, health and the problems of drug abuse, crime\r\nand violence. These challenges are compounded when many\r\nyoung people feel marginalized or alienated, and excluded\r\nfrom important policy decisions affecting them.\r\nMost countries, especially developing countries, face\r\nserious problems of unemployment and underemployment,\r\nand youth are among the most severely affected. In\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, for example, 75 per cent of the\r\nunemployed are young persons. The job market is also\r\nincreasingly unable to employ youth at their levels of\r\nqualifications and skills, and they are likely to be engaged\r\nin work below their capability. This is a disconcerting\r\nsituation because employment provides youth with the\r\nmeans to support themselves, a way of actively contributing\r\nto the economic development of their communities, and a\r\nmeans of obtaining a level of independence in the\r\ndevelopment of adult roles and responsibilities.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago attaches the greatest priority to\r\ntraining and employment programmes for young people. In\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, such programmes include the Youth\r\nTraining and Employment Partnership Programme and the\r\nApprenticeship for Industrial Mobilization. The Youth\r\nTraining and Employment Partnership Programme\r\ncomprises a Career Enhancement Project, a Vocational\r\nSkills Training Project and a Micro-Entrepreneurship\r\nProject. The common theme of the Programme is the\r\noverall training and self-development of youth to\r\nengender a transformation of their natural skills into an\r\nincome-earning opportunity. The Apprenticeship for\r\nIndustrial Mobilization utilizes on-the-job training\r\ntechniques as a means of equipping young people.\r\nOther approaches adopted by the Government to\r\npromote youth employment through training and\r\nretraining are: the use of youth camps, which offer a wide\r\nrange of craft and secretarial courses; trade centres, which\r\nconcentrate on the construction industry and skills related\r\nto house maintenance; and youth centres. The non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the private sector are also\r\ninvolved in the provision of trade and skills training for\r\nyoung people.\r\nSome other initiatives adopted in Trinidad and\r\nTobago, geared to relieving youth unemployment, include\r\nthe introduction in 1993 of the Civilian Conservation\r\nCorps, which offers temporary employment in projects\r\nrelated mainly to the improvement of the environment, as\r\nwell as the Aided Self-Help Programme and the Small\r\nBusiness Management Programme, both designed to assist\r\nyoung entrepreneurs. More recently, the Agricultural\r\nDevelopment Bank has opened a “youth window”,\r\noffering soft loans and support services to young people\r\ninterested in pursuing agriculture.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has a comprehensive education\r\nsystem but, as in many countries, its inability to provide\r\nstudents with the skills for the changing job market is a\r\nmatter of concern. Another disturbing development is the\r\ndeterioration in the performance of young men in the\r\neducation system, with a growing incidence of drop-outs\r\nand functional illiteracy. These concerns were among the\r\nissues considered by a National Task Force on Education.\r\nThe recommendations of the Task Force are being given\r\nserious consideration as Trinidad and Tobago attempts to\r\nreform the education system to meet today’s needs. The\r\ncrucial role of education in the development process and\r\nthe growth of individuals, especially young people, forms\r\na cornerstone in attempts to restructure the education\r\nsystem.\r\nAnother critical basic need is good health. Key\r\nhealth issues affecting youth include malnutrition,\r\nsexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, teenage\r\npregnancies, narcotic and psychotropic drug abuse, misuse\r\nof alcohol and tobacco, and psychological and mental\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\ndisorders. A most disconcerting development is the high\r\nincrease of young people suffering from HIV/AIDS. The\r\nWorld Health Organization’s Global Programme on AIDS\r\nstates that 50 per cent of HIV infections occur in people\r\naged 15 to 24 and about one fifth of all people who have\r\nAIDS are in their twenties. Male youth in the Caribbean are\r\nalso at high risk due to HIV infection, and AIDS is now a\r\nleading cause of death among young men in the region.\r\nAnother area in need of urgent attention is widespread\r\ndrug abuse and drug trafficking and the increase in alcohol\r\nconsumption and tobacco use among young people.\r\nDemand reduction programmes for drugs, tobacco and\r\nalcohol need to target more on youth. The drug problem is\r\nparticularly serious because there is a marked correlation\r\nbetween the increase in drug abuse and violent crimes. In\r\nthe Caribbean, the typical offender and victim of drug-\r\nrelated violent crimes is the young working-class male.\r\nIn Trinidad and Tobago the National Alcohol and\r\nDrug Abuse Prevention Programme coordinates drug abuse\r\nprevention initiatives and fosters and facilitates the efforts\r\nof several non-governmental organizations involved in the\r\nstruggle against drug abuse. A central element of its\r\nprogramme is focused on youth, both in and out of the\r\nschool system. The Prevention Programme is also involved\r\nin treatment and rehabilitation.\r\nAnother growing phenomenon that is engaging the\r\nattention of policy-makers in the Caribbean is the\r\nemergence of street children and the incidence of\r\nhomelessness among young people. Some of the factors\r\ncontributing to this development are the deterioration in\r\nsocio-economic conditions and the effects of drug addiction.\r\nThe erosion in the family structure and value systems, and\r\nthe lack of proper role models, are also factors that must be\r\ngiven attention in considering these and other related needs\r\nand problems of youth.\r\nI now wish to turn briefly to the issue of institutional\r\narrangements. In Trinidad and Tobago, there exists a wide\r\ncross-section of voluntary organizations whose aim is to\r\nassist young people in their development. There is an active\r\nYouth Affairs Division located in the Ministry of Sport and\r\nYouth Affairs, and its vision is to foster an environment for\r\nthe development of youth. It is also recognized that there\r\nneeds to be an integrated approach to youth policy and that\r\nyoung people must be part of the consultation and decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago\r\nacknowledges the need to rationalize its youth development\r\nthrust, and a comprehensive study on the present situation\r\nof youth in Trinidad and Tobago has been commissioned.\r\nThis study will look at the nature and magnitude of the\r\nsocial problems, attitudes, behaviour and perspectives of\r\nyoung people and present a profile of the country’s youth.\r\nWith respect to regional cooperation on youth\r\naffairs, the Caribbean Centre of the Commonwealth\r\nYouth Programme plays a crucial role in coordinating\r\nregional policies and programmes. Its activities include\r\nyouth exchanges, training and seminars. An important\r\ntenet of the Commonwealth Youth Programme is to work\r\ntowards developing a society where young men and\r\nwomen are empowered to develop their potential,\r\ncreativity and skills. In May this year, a successful\r\nmeeting of Commonwealth Youth Ministers was held in\r\nTrinidad and Tobago. The activities of the United\r\nNations, through its regional commissions, are also\r\nextremely useful. In this connection, I wish to make\r\nspecial mention of the meeting held in Chile in September\r\n1991, at which a joint declaration of United Nations\r\nbodies and other intergovernmental organizations on\r\npolicies relating to youth in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean was adopted.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago also wishes to commend the\r\nefforts of the United Nations in formulating an\r\ninternational policy on youth, with emphasis on the\r\nimportant themes of participation, development and peace.\r\nThe adoption and implementation of the proposed World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond will be another significant step forward in helping\r\nto address effectively the challenges facing our youth, so\r\nas to enhance their participation in and their contribution\r\nto society. My delegation places particular emphasis on\r\nthe recognition, in the draft World Programme of Action,\r\nof the essential role of international cooperation,\r\nespecially as it relates to international technical assistance\r\nand advisory services. There must be concerted action by\r\nthe international community in order to ensure the success\r\nof the World Programme.\r\nYoung people constitute a major human resource.\r\nThey are the parents and leaders of tomorrow and a\r\nsignificant force in the economic, political and social\r\ndevelopment of our countries. It is our responsibility to\r\nwork with them to ensure a better world for our own\r\ngeneration and for generations to come. They deserve\r\nnothing less.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of Paraguay, Mr. Enrique\r\nRiera Escudero, Deputy Minister for Youth.\r\nMr. Riera Escudero (Paraguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Republic of Paraguay, which has a long\r\nhistory of authoritarian Governments, has enjoyed full civil\r\nand political freedoms for more than six years now, as part\r\nof a democratic process which, slowly but surely, is being\r\nconsolidated and strengthened, with the consensus of a\r\nnoble, peace-loving and hard-working people that makes\r\ndaily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its\r\nchildren.\r\nIn these first few years the democratic Government\r\nhas devoted its best efforts to restoring rights that were\r\ninfringed for three decades and to restructuring the branches\r\nof Government, whose balance and interdependence were\r\nestablished in the new national Constitution, which has\r\nbeen in force since 1992.\r\nAt the same time, we have created constitutional\r\nmechanisms to monitor public affairs. In addition to the\r\nunconditional reinstatement of freedom of the press, the\r\nNational Congress has regained its indispensable autonomy\r\nand the power to balance the activities of the executive\r\nbranch through the office of the Comptroller-General of the\r\nRepublic, the Ombudsman and bicameral investigative\r\ncommissions, which have yielded important results in terms\r\nof administrative transparency.\r\nFinally, we have established the new Supreme Court\r\nof Justice — which is appointing new judges in every\r\njurisdiction of the country — thus completing the\r\nrestructuring of the third and last branch of government\r\nawaiting restoration in this democratic process. Within this\r\nlegal-political framework, built on the basis of an\r\nestablished timetable, we can say with conviction that the\r\nprocess of democratization in Paraguay is irreversible.\r\nHowever, despite progress in the political sphere, the\r\ndemocratic system has revealed major economic and social\r\nshortcomings as a result of the freedoms that we are\r\nenjoying. Nowadays the national Government takes a\r\nresponsible approach to the structural imbalances in our\r\neconomy, which created serious social problems that were\r\nnot given institutional attention for a long time. We come\r\nfrom a State-controlled and overprotective economic\r\nsystem, which, with its paternalistic attitudes and vexatious\r\nfavouritism, gave rise to unjust inequalities in terms of\r\naccess to opportunities for personal advancement and in the\r\ndevelopment of our national economy.\r\nOur present approach to a social market-economy\r\nsystem has made possible the creation of a climate of\r\ncompetence, with equal opportunities, aimed at the\r\nsustainable development of the country with social equity\r\nin order to make us more efficient and competitive\r\nregionally, in the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR), and internationally, with the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\nIn this context, a country like ours, where 70 per\r\ncent of the population are under 35 years of age and half\r\nthe people are under 20, has a great future. The Vice-\r\nMinistry of Youth, one year after its establishment as a\r\nbranch of the Ministry of Education and Worship,\r\nsubmitted the first national youth plan, entitled “The\r\nCountry We Want”. The process of drafting this plan was\r\neminently participatory, more than 2,500 youth leaders\r\nfrom all political parties, religious youth organizations,\r\nstudent organizations, trade and labour unions and sports\r\norganizations having been brought together through the\r\nregional consultative forums that were held in the\r\ndepartments in the interior of the Republic.\r\nIn that plan, which was submitted to the President of\r\nthe Republic on 21 September this year — Youth Day —\r\nyouth is regarded as “the primary strategic human\r\nresource” because young people assimilate new\r\ntechnology more easily, have initiative and are more able\r\nto adapt to change with the speed and thoroughness\r\nrequired in our times.\r\nThese thousands of Paraguayan young people, who\r\nhave been living in democracy for more than six years,\r\nrealize that they are no longer a problem but, rather, our\r\ncountry’s solution. But we need to invest in them, not by\r\nadopting the mistaken and outdated approach of offering\r\nthem only frivolities or superficial things, such as sports\r\nor entertainment, but by offering them serious\r\nopportunities for their complete development and\r\nsolutions for their fundamental problems, such as work,\r\neducation and health, as well as addressing other, equally\r\nimportant questions, such as drugs, AIDS, tobacco and\r\nalcohol. We are committed to ensuring that youth,\r\nrepresenting the present and future of Paraguay, will as\r\nsoon as possible become part of our democratic process\r\nand of the socio-economic development of the country,\r\nfor the benefit of our people.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn addition, we pledge, in this historic Hall, to work\r\nintensively to achieve with them an international world\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nthat is more peaceful, integrated and united and whose\r\ncountries pool their efforts, not only because they need each\r\nother but also because they have a sincere appreciation of\r\neach other’s peoples, languages, customs and ideas.\r\nThrough the exchange of human, scientific and economic\r\nresources, we can all help each other in solving the\r\nproblems of our people and our peoples, which is the\r\nsupreme and ultimate goal of our efforts.\r\nToday it is no longer possible to imagine a world of\r\nisolation, with countries and leaders insensitive to the major\r\nproblems of mankind, distant from others, walled off by\r\nsilence, sterile confrontation or the wasteful use of\r\nresources for destruction rather than construction. Young\r\npeople are and in human history will always constitute a\r\nvanguard and an inexhaustible moral reserve.\r\nThe generation that enters the year 2000 faced with a\r\nperceptible crisis of ethical and moral values must renew\r\nwith more vigour than ever its commitment to society,\r\nguided always by its convictions and never by\r\nconsiderations of convenience, respecting human rights and\r\nstruggling with all its force for the perennial principles of\r\njustice, freedom and equality for all.\r\nLet us never abandon these ideals, which are like stars\r\nthat we may never attain but must never lose sight of in\r\norder not to stray from our path.\r\nI wish to conclude with a thought that sums up our\r\nvision of the mission of the men and women who live on\r\nthis beautiful planet: we did not inherit this Earth from our\r\nparents; we have it on loan from our children.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform the Assembly\r\nthat the representative of Australia has requested to\r\nparticipate in the debate on this item. Inasmuch as the list\r\nof speakers was closed yesterday, may I ask the Assembly\r\nwhether there is any objection to the inclusion of that\r\ndelegation in the list of speakers?\r\nI see no objection. Australia is therefore included in\r\nthe list.\r\nI should like again to remind all representatives that\r\nwe have a long list of speakers. Owing to the serious\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations, the afternoon\r\nmeeting has to adjourn at 6 p.m. I therefore appeal to all\r\nspeakers to keep their statements brief so that all\r\nparticipants, some of whom have come from far away for\r\nthese meetings, may be able to speak today within the time\r\nallocated to these meetings.\r\nI now call on the representative of India,\r\nMs. Murugesan.\r\nMs. Murugesan (India): The global youth\r\npopulation numbers more than a billion, of which more\r\nthan 80 per cent are in the developing countries. While\r\nthis is a message of hope, it is also a challenge.\r\nDeveloping countries today face poverty, population\r\ngrowth, inadequate shelter and housing, and weakening of\r\nsupport systems. India, like many other countries, has to\r\nconfront these problems by focusing on the potential of\r\nyouth and devising ways to exploit this through social and\r\neconomic restructuring and the creation of appropriate\r\nsocial and Government mechanisms.\r\nThe proposed United Nations World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, the\r\nadoption of which we support, focuses on 10 critical areas\r\nof concern, among them education, employment, poverty,\r\nenvironment, juvenile delinquency and participation in\r\nsocietal decision-making. Special attention is needed to\r\naddress the concerns of girls and young women. The draft\r\nProgramme is ambitious, and could provide guidelines or\r\nuseful inputs for governmental action on youth affairs.\r\nThe Government of India has instituted a department\r\nat the national level to coordinate youth affairs under its\r\nMinistry for Human Resource Development. A number of\r\nprogrammes have been devised to appropriately channel\r\nyouth energies, and to train the young at all stages. The\r\nscheme of national yuva kendras, or youth centres, which\r\ncame into operation in 1972, was aimed at focusing on\r\nthe employment capabilities of rural youth. These youth\r\ncentres organize leadership training programmes and\r\nsocial services.\r\nThe National Service Scheme is another programme\r\nwhich is aimed at involving university and high school\r\nstudents in rural reconstruction activities to assist the\r\nweaker sections of society. These students are also\r\ninvolved in the promotion of national family welfare\r\nprogrammes and the national literacy mission. Besides\r\nthis, cultural exchanges are arranged between students\r\nfrom various parts of the country and foreign students.\r\nThe Government provides free primary education\r\nthroughout the country and, at the higher levels, finances\r\nthe education of meritorious students from the weaker\r\nsections of the society in addition to subsidizing such\r\nhigher education for the rest of society.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nIndia also has perhaps one of the largest affirmative\r\naction programmes aimed at the upliftment of women and\r\nthe weaker sections of society.\r\nIn the decade between 1985 and 1995, the global\r\nsocial picture has changed. Young people are today faced\r\nwith tougher choices, fewer opportunities, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping countries, and are exposed to societies\r\nincreasingly succumbing to drugs, AIDS and street crime.\r\nThe United Nations proposal to improve the situation of\r\nyouth through concerted action aimed at enhancing youth\r\nprogrammes and their implementation and evaluation at all\r\nlevels needs all-round support.\r\nThe family is the basic building block of society.\r\nGood family values have been able to curtail tension,\r\nconflict, crime and violence in society, particularly in the\r\nyoung, and have protected, to a large degree, the rights and\r\nsafety of children, engendered a sound social compact and\r\nresponsibility, and directly contributed to the internal peace,\r\ngrowth, stability and harmony of society. It is of paramount\r\nimportance that United Nations activities on human rights\r\neducation should draw upon the best of successful family\r\ntraditions and values from all societies, from both the East\r\nand the West, and promote them around the globe in the\r\ninterest of more peaceful societies, and the preservation of\r\nhuman rights and social values for all mankind. Individuals\r\nas they grow up must realize that they not only have rights\r\nin society, but responsibilities to society as well, and to the\r\nglobal family as a whole, as reflected in the ancient Indian\r\nconcept of vasudeva kudumbakkam, which means that the\r\nworld is but one family.\r\nFor all, particularly young people, the family is the\r\nfirst resource and last resort. It is, however, unfortunate that\r\nfamilies today are experiencing socio-economic changes\r\nthat challenge their very structure, and the multigenerational\r\nrelationships that they nurture. It is vital for the continuing\r\nstability of societies that communications between the\r\nyounger and the older generations must continue. The\r\nOrient continues the tradition of the young caring for the\r\nold in the same manner that they had been cared for from\r\ntheir infancy. The aged, whose numbers are increasing,\r\nneed special attention from the younger generations who\r\nhave matured under their nourishing care.\r\nThe Declaration of Intent on Youth, part I of the draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action, calls upon Governments to\r\nprovide opportunities for education for the young and\r\nproductive employment; it also underlines the responsibility\r\nof Governments for guaranteeing to the young full\r\nenjoyment of all human rights; to take necessary steps to\r\neliminate all forms of discrimination against women and\r\ngirls and, above all, to foster in their own societies\r\nrespect and tolerance among young people for all cultures\r\nand religions. The draft Declaration of Intent and the\r\nProgramme of Action as a whole, which focus on\r\nmeasures to strengthen national capabilities in the field of\r\nyouth, provide practical guidelines for national policies on\r\nyouth with international support.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nMongolia, Mr. Tserenchimidiin Zorigtbaatar, Foreign\r\nRelations Secretary of the Mongolian Youth Federation.\r\nMr. Zorigtbaatar (Mongolia): It is a great honour\r\nfor me to represent the youth of Mongolia at this special\r\nplenary meeting of the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year.\r\nIt is especially opportune that this occasion should\r\nfall shortly after the solemn commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. This august Hall still\r\nholds in the air the unreserved commitment and unfailing\r\nfaith of the world’s leaders to the United Nations of\r\ntomorrow. To make tomorrow brighter we, the youth of\r\nthe world, have to shoulder greater responsibility and\r\nexercise a stronger voice, commensurate to the challenges\r\nahead. In this regard, we believe that the draft World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond, which we hope will be adopted at the end of our\r\ndeliberations today, will undoubtedly provide the sound\r\npolicy framework and practical guidelines for national and\r\ninternational action to improve the situation of young\r\npeople and enhance their participation in society. It is\r\nheartening to see that the draft Programme is built upon\r\nthe important outcome and experience generated at the\r\nrecent global Conferences held in Cairo, Copenhagen and\r\nBeijing.\r\nVarious problems faced by society are more acutely\r\nfelt by its young members, since they constitute, by and\r\nlarge, the most vulnerable and marginalized group. This\r\nis even more the case for a country like Mongolia, where\r\nthe young under 35 make up 75 per cent of the entire\r\npopulation. The 1990 wind of change has brought\r\npolitical pluralism and economic liberalization, along with\r\nan outbreak of such ills as poverty, unemployment, social\r\ndisintegration and erosion of the societal fabric. Young\r\npeople found themselves among the most vulnerable\r\nsector of society, prey to the web of juvenile crime and\r\nthe phenomena of street children and school drop-outs,\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nilliteracy, unemployment and underemployment and tobacco\r\nand alcohol addiction.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia, in cooperation with\r\nrelevant non-governmental organizations, is taking energetic\r\nmeasures to redress and improve the situation of young\r\npeople. They include, inter alia, the organization of short-\r\nand long-term training and skill-training for income-\r\ngeneration by young people, thus helping create\r\nopportunities for self-employment for the poorer and\r\nweaker, and the adoption of policies discouraging tobacco\r\nand alcohol use, especially among children.\r\nThis year’s autumn session of the Mongolian\r\nParliament will consider a draft single youth law aimed at\r\nprotecting the rights of the young people and ensuring their\r\nfull participation in the life of society.\r\nThe Mongolian Youth Federation, an umbrella\r\norganization comprising 12 local organizations and\r\nmovements with 80,000 members, with grass-roots\r\nrepresentation in every administrative unit throughout the\r\ncountry, closely cooperates with the Government and other\r\nrelevant non-governmental organizations on youth-related\r\nissues. The Federation, together with the Labour and\r\nPopulation Policy Ministry, has submitted for the\r\nconsideration of the Government a draft comprehensive\r\nplan of action on youth to the year 2000 and beyond,\r\nwhose implementation will, we hope, start at the beginning\r\nof the next year.\r\nLet me briefly touch on some of the pressing problems\r\nfacing Mongolian youth today.\r\nFirst, as in society at large, youth education finds itself\r\nin a critical situation. Growing numbers of school drop-outs\r\nturn tomorrow’s teenagers into illiterates. On the other\r\nhand, many of those young people who managed to\r\ngraduate from high school are unable to pay for their higher\r\neducation tuition, thus joining the ranks of the unemployed.\r\nTherefore, increased attention and greater efforts are needed\r\nto provide basic education to the illiterates in the first group\r\nand skill-training to those who are functionally illiterate.\r\nThe Mongolian Youth Federation, with the support of\r\nthe European Union, has begun implementation of a two-\r\nyear project designed to help young single mothers/heads of\r\nhouseholds, to provide street children with medical care and\r\nbasic social services, and functionally illiterate youth with\r\nskill-training.\r\nSecondly, the poor and low-income young people\r\nunable to participate in the health insurance system do not\r\nreceive any medical care or aid. In this respect, we are\r\nfocusing our efforts on publicizing preventive measures,\r\ndisseminating primary health knowledge and practices\r\namong a wider circle of youth.\r\nThe Mongolian Youth Federation is a full-fledged\r\nmember of the World Assembly of Youth, the Asian\r\nYouth Council and the World Federation of Democratic\r\nYouth. We maintain close cooperation with sister\r\norganizations in more than 40 countries around the world.\r\nWe feel proud that at the initiative of our Federation\r\na strong youth campaign for the protection of the\r\nenvironment has been launched in Ulan Bator as an\r\noutcome of the “Wild Nature” workshop held in August\r\n1994 with the participation of youth representatives from\r\n11 countries of the Asia-Pacific region. It is gratifying to\r\nnote that this Ulan Bator initiative for the preservation of\r\nwild nature for succeeding generations has been and will\r\nbe further manifested in Singapore and Thailand\r\nrespectively.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate the determination of\r\nMongolian young people to collaborate with their sisters\r\nand brothers around the world to implement the World\r\nYouth Programme to the full.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nJamaica, Ms. Cheryl Gordon, Youth Representative.\r\nMs. Gordon (Jamaica): Ten years ago the United\r\nNations, recognizing the need for international attention\r\nto be focused on the situation of the world’s youth,\r\nparticularly their increasing problems, designated 1985 as\r\nInternational Youth Year, with “Participation,\r\nDevelopment, Peace” as its theme. The objectives of that\r\nspecial Year were to enhance awareness of the needs and\r\naspirations of youth; to make youth activities an integral\r\npart of social and economic development; to enhance\r\nyouth participation in society; and to promote among\r\nyouth the ideals of peace, mutual respect and\r\nunderstanding among people.\r\nIn accordance with these objectives, an International\r\nYouth Conference and World Youth Festival was\r\nconvened in 1985 in Kingston, Jamaica, and was attended\r\nby over 1,000 youth leaders from some 100 countries.\r\nAdopted at that Conference was the Kingston Declaration\r\nof Principles, in which the youth leaders reaffirmed their\r\nadherence to freedom, justice and the democratic way of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nlife. It is significant that in the era of the cold war, when\r\nideology split the nations of the world into hostile camps,\r\nthe youth of this same world made their voices heard in\r\nsupport of world peace, in keeping with the United Nations\r\ntheme for 1985.\r\nAnother highlight of the Year was the General\r\nAssembly’s endorsement of guidelines for further planning\r\nand suitable follow-up in the field of youth. These\r\nguidelines contained suggestions on how countries could\r\ndevelop and implement youth policies and programmes\r\naccording to the needs and situation of each country.\r\nTen years later, many of the youths of 1985 have\r\ngrown up. Ten years later, the cold war, thankfully, is over,\r\nand so the peoples of the world are no longer divided to\r\nsuch a large extent by ideology. This creates a wonderful\r\nopportunity for young people from different parts of the\r\nworld to have greater interaction with one another, sharing\r\nexperiences and solutions to common problems. And the\r\nworld’s youths, ever alert, are taking advantage of this\r\nopportunity.\r\nThe end of the cold war has also redirected global\r\nattention to the issue of social development. The link\r\nbetween peace and development has been recognized by the\r\nUnited Nations, which has convened six global conferences\r\nsince 1990 on themes related to human rights and economic\r\nand social development. This concept was recently\r\nunderscored by the Prime Minister of Jamaica, the Right\r\nHonourable P. J. Patterson. Speaking earlier this year at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, in Copenhagen, he\r\nstated,\r\n“there can be no lasting and universal peace until we\r\nforge that new global partnership that eradicates the\r\nscourge of poverty, provides adequate shelter, combats\r\nilliteracy, malnutrition and drug addiction, affords\r\nadequate health security and halts human\r\nexploitation”.\r\nThese problems, which besiege humanity in general, affect\r\nyouth to an even greater extent. Many of the problems and\r\ninterests that had been identified as urgent have multiplied\r\nin size, scope and intensity. A new “mid-generation” of\r\nyouth calls for our attention to the same problems and\r\nconcerns as beset its predecessors. Jamaica is therefore very\r\npleased that the General Assembly has devoted its attention\r\nat this year’s historic session to stirring the international\r\ncommunity to renewed action in order to ensure that the\r\nproblems and concerns affecting our youth are properly\r\naddressed.\r\nJamaica has always been actively involved in youth\r\nactivities at the regional and international levels. In 1985\r\nwe were honoured to be one of 24 countries selected to\r\ncome up with a document directed towards proposing\r\nsolutions for some of the problems of the world’s youth.\r\nThat document was the forerunner of the current draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the year 2000\r\nand beyond, which Jamaica hopes will be adopted during\r\nthese plenary meetings. At the national level, our youth,\r\nlike that of other countries, has been the agent and\r\ncatalyst of social and political change, notably, but not\r\nsolely, through artistic expression. Jamaican youth\r\ndelegates participated extensively in two of the\r\nPreparatory Committee meetings for the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development and in a number of activities held\r\nearlier this year in honour of the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year. Jamaica fully endorsed General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/152, of December 1994, and in\r\nkeeping with this commitment, has included\r\nrepresentatives from eight governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in its official delegation to\r\ntake part in this historic session of the General Assembly.\r\nJamaica’s active participation in youth discussions at the\r\ninternational level has born fruit: we were among the first\r\ncountries to implement a national youth policy, which\r\nmirrors the draft World Programme of Action for Youth\r\nin many respects.\r\nThe draft Programme of Action outlines the issues\r\nconfronting today’s youth, which include education,\r\nemployment, hunger and poverty, health, environment,\r\ndrug abuse, juvenile delinquency, recreation and leisure\r\nand rights and responsibilities. These concerns are\r\nsimilarly reflected in Jamaica’s National Youth Policy,\r\nwhich identifies eight major issues facing our youth.\r\nThese include the effects of cultural penetration and rising\r\nmaterialism, alienation and lack of recognition and health-\r\nrelated problems.\r\nThe draft document also suggests strategies for\r\naddressing these issues. With respect to education, the\r\ndraft Programme proposes to address deficiencies in the\r\neducation of youth through, for example, improvements\r\nin vocational and professional training and access to\r\napprenticeship programmes. In addition, Governments\r\nshould establish or strengthen programmes to educate\r\nyoung people about the cultural heritage of their societies.\r\nSimilar measures contained in Jamaica’s National\r\nYouth Policy include an increased emphasis, within\r\neducational programmes, on Jamaican culture and\r\nheritage, an expansion of our apprenticeship programme\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nand a review of school curricula to ensure that subjects\r\ntaught are relevant to the requirements of the job market.\r\nMost importantly, Jamaica has this year reintroduced\r\nits National Youth Service, which will have very strong\r\ncomponents of leadership training and remedial education.\r\nThe draft Programme also suggests the promotion of self-\r\nemployment schemes for youth with funding and technical\r\nsupport from Governments and private-sector bodies. Also\r\nsuggested are cooperative schemes in which young people\r\ncould be involved in the production and marketing of goods\r\nand services. In accordance with our National Youth Policy,\r\nJamaica will be developing model youth-run cooperatives\r\nthat will include guidelines for management training in\r\nentrepreneurial techniques. Similar programmes already\r\nexist within the secondary school system.\r\nIn the area of agriculture, the draft Programme states\r\nthat Governments should provide land grants to youth and\r\nyouth organizations. In line with this renewed focus on\r\nagriculture, the Jamaican Government will embark on a\r\nmajor promotion scheme to encourage young people to take\r\nup agricultural careers, and to facilitate their doing so, by\r\nproviding special access to land, capital and technical\r\nassistance.\r\nIn the area of health, Jamaica’s National Policy is\r\ngeared towards the promotion of health education to\r\nencourage positive values and attitudes among our youth.\r\nThis includes a focus on preventive action as well as\r\nprogrammes designed to instruct youth in parenting skills\r\nand responsibilities, health education and family-life\r\neducation. Teenage fathers and mothers will be specially\r\ntargeted. Already operating in Jamaica there are\r\nprogrammes designed to assist teenage girls whose\r\neducation has been interrupted by pregnancy. Many of these\r\nprogrammes also provide counselling for teenage fathers\r\nand the parents of teenage mothers.\r\nIn the area of drug abuse, Jamaica will target youth\r\norganizations as key players in designing and implementing\r\nprogrammes to help reintegrate young people into the\r\ncommunity, which we consider to be the best protection\r\nagainst potential drug abuse. Treatment and rehabilitation\r\nprogrammes for young substance abusers will also make\r\nuse of peer group pressure in a positive way, as young\r\npeople can participate in therapy sessions for substance\r\nabusers.\r\nIn line with International Youth Year’s theme of\r\nparticipation, Jamaica’s youth-leadership programme will\r\nalso be expanded to enable young people to be effectively\r\nrepresented in decision-making and implementation\r\nactivities taking place in society. Young people are\r\nespecially concerned about the preservation of the\r\nenvironment and the increasing use of violence to resolve\r\nconflicts.\r\nIf I have focused overwhelmingly on problems\r\naffecting young people in my country, it is precisely\r\nbecause these are the issues that Jamaican youths have\r\nthemselves repeatedly emphasized as their major concerns\r\nand that they need to see properly addressed. Although\r\nvarious national programmes have been implemented in\r\nthe past — aimed at skills, training and self-help, among\r\nother things — these have had only a limited impact. The\r\ntruth is that the institutional framework for addressing\r\nyouth-related problems and issues in Jamaica has been\r\ninadequate, with limited coordination and interaction\r\nbetween the various youth organizations, both\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental. This has led to\r\nduplication of services, a waste of resources and\r\npiecemeal solutions. In addition, there was no officially\r\napproved policy on youth to guide agencies so that they\r\nwould act in accordance with a common set of strategies\r\nor towards common goals.\r\nJamaica’s national youth policy was therefore\r\ndesigned to redress all these deficiencies, but first of all\r\nto bring an integrated approach to the activities of youth\r\norganizations nation wide and to equip all youth with the\r\nnecessary academic, technical and life-coping skills to\r\nfoster their personal development. The policy is the\r\nproduct of extensive consultation, participation and\r\ndiscussion involving a wide cross-section of youth-related\r\norganizations and groups across Jamaica, both\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental.\r\nWe have also strengthened our Youth Division,\r\nlocated in the Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture,\r\nto be the focal point for the implementation of our youth\r\npolicy, coordinating the various youth programmes\r\nthrough collaboration with Government and non-\r\ngovernmental youth organizations. The policy is not\r\nintended to be either static or cast in stone. Consultations\r\ntowards improving and updating its strategies and their\r\neffective implementation will continue to be sought.\r\nAs is clear, the policy I have just outlined is,\r\ncertainly from the point of view of my own country, an\r\nextremely ambitious one. It not only comprises new and\r\ncreative measures to address the needs and aspirations of\r\nour youth, but also seeks to reintroduce and reinvigorate\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\ntraditional and past programmes and practices of previous\r\ngenerations.\r\nAside from the already present political will and\r\ncommitment on the part of Governments, financial and\r\ntechnical assistance, as well as advice, are needed if\r\nprogrammes such as those I have outlined are to succeed\r\nand to remain on track. In the specific case of Jamaica, the\r\nGovernment has identified, for necessary international\r\nassistance, priority measures concerning the establishment\r\nof the appropriate institutional structure, the establishment\r\nof a database on youth in Jamaica, and the expansion of our\r\nNational Youth Service. In this respect, United Nations help\r\nwill be sought to provide technical assistance for\r\nconsultants, training, attachments, study, visits, equipment,\r\nand funds for feasibility studies and pilot projects. More\r\ncreative means of assistance could be devised to assist\r\nyouth, which would involve more funds being made\r\navailable by Governments on a voluntary basis, but which\r\ncould also involve the provision of non-monetary\r\nassistance, such as technical assistance and advice. We as\r\nGovernments have to remember that youth are not patient.\r\nTheir concerns and solutions to the problems that affect\r\nthem cannot be put on hold, pending discussion and\r\nbureaucratic red tape, as these concerns and problems often\r\ndevelop and explode at a remarkable pace.\r\nAlthough the situation of youth differs from one\r\ncountry to another, we believe that young people world\r\nwide would benefit from an increased exchange of ideas\r\namong themselves and among Governments and\r\nGovernment agencies responsible for youth, on similar\r\nquestions relating to their young people.\r\nJamaica, as one of the countries intimately involved in\r\nthe formulation of the document before the Assembly, fully\r\nendorses it and urges fellow Member States to do the same.\r\nOf course all the measures contained in the draft\r\nProgramme of Action will not be fully applicable to all our\r\ncountries; that is illogical. During the negotiations on the\r\nfinal draft these past three weeks, differences in culture and\r\nstyle again made it obvious that the document could not\r\nadopt a blanket approach to concerns facing the world’s\r\nyouth. But then, that was never the intention.\r\nThe intention of elaborating this draft Programme of\r\nAction was to provide a basic — I repeat, basic —\r\nguideline for Governments to consult when designing their\r\nyouth policies or programmes. This was also in the hope\r\nthat the attention of the world community would be\r\nrefocused on the question of youth. Jamaica has designed\r\nits youth policy to suit the needs and aspirations of\r\nJamaica’s youth, and even these will change in time.\r\nOther countries have also formulated, either recently or\r\nlong ago, youth policies or their equivalents, without\r\nfeeling constrained by United Nations formulation.\r\nWe need to ensure that the cries of our young people\r\nare heard and, more importantly, are acted upon at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. As we live in\r\nan increasingly interdependent world, our youth, more\r\nthan ever before, are cosmopolitan creatures, and it is\r\nonly logical that we should follow their example in our\r\napproach to the question of international youth policy.\r\nAt present, there is national, regional and\r\ninternational consensus on the need for youth to be at the\r\ntop of national priorities, as other problems and issues\r\nthat concern Governments now will be left to future\r\nGovernments to sort out. And since the nations of the\r\nfuture will be inhabited by the youth of today, what better\r\nway to ensure their future than to lay the proper\r\nfoundations — with our youth, for our youth.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nUganda, Mr. Mukasa-Ssali.\r\nMr. Mukasa-Ssali (Uganda): During the recent\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting on the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, social development\r\nwas one of the subjects highlighted by many Heads of\r\nState or Government. It was also the subject of the United\r\nNations World Summit for Social Development, held in\r\nCopenhagen, which included a specific component on the\r\nsituation of youth. Indeed, Copenhagen was an important\r\nlandmark in the evolution of our perception of\r\ndevelopment. We agreed that development should no\r\nlonger be defined merely in economic terms but must be\r\npeople-centred, and that, equally, comprehensive\r\ndevelopment was no longer a matter of benign charity or\r\nof attentive discretion. It is an obligation cast upon all\r\nMember States, developed and developing alike.\r\nIn the Copenhagen Declaration on Social\r\nDevelopment, a set of measures was agreed on to reverse\r\nthe deteriorating social situation world wide. As we\r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\nYear, those measures should be embarked upon without\r\nany further delay. But most important is the need to react\r\nto critical situations rapidly and appropriately. In this\r\nrespect, the socio-economic situation in developed\r\ncountries, and in particular in the least developed\r\ncountries and in sub-Saharan Africa, leaves no doubt\r\nabout the need for urgent action. It is in those countries\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nthat we find rampant deprivation and social dislocation of\r\nyouth as a result of famine, disease inadequate shelter,\r\nunsafe water, the lowest standards of basic education and\r\ngeneralized impoverishment.\r\nYouth are the vanguard of the future. It is in their\r\nhands that we shall place today’s achievements.\r\nUnfortunately, the condition of children, like that of their\r\nparents, in a number of countries — especially those of\r\nAfrica — remains critical due to socio-economic factors\r\nand to various forms of neglect, violence and exploitation,\r\nand to armed conflict, demographic growth, environmental\r\ndegradation and the scourge of diseases and epidemics such\r\nas HIV/AIDS.\r\nIndeed, praiseworthy efforts are being made by\r\nMember States to launch and implement national plans of\r\naction in the context of the World Declaration on the\r\nSurvival, Protection and Development of Children in the\r\n1990s. Those efforts need augmentation. My delegation\r\ntherefore calls upon the international community, the United\r\nNations institutions concerned, financial institutions and\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to\r\nincrease the mobilization of resources in order to achieve\r\nthe Decade’s goals, within the framework of the promotion\r\nof genuine partnerships to improve the international\r\neconomic environment and guarantee survival and\r\nmeaningful development for children.\r\nDebt is a phenomenon that deserves special mention.\r\nPersistent debt burden affords most of our countries no\r\nopportunity adequately to plan and prepare for the future —\r\nand this is the future that will be in the hands of today’s\r\nyouth. In the final analysis, therefore, debt calls for bold\r\nonce-and-for-all development-oriented action involving all\r\ntypes of debts, including total write-offs, the provision of\r\nmore concessional resources, and other innovative\r\nmeasures.\r\nIn the developed countries, there are social security\r\narrangements like homes and specialized institutions for\r\nspecial social groups such as the aged and the disabled.\r\nThese are rarely existent in most African countries, though\r\nthey are occasionally found in urban centres, but even then\r\ncover an insignificant number of the special social groups.\r\nThe main social security for the aged and the disabled has\r\ntraditionally been the family. But, with increasing poverty,\r\neven this crude safety net can no longer be provided. It thus\r\nbecomes appropriate that any measures to address the\r\nspecial needs of the aged and the disabled in our countries\r\nshould have a bearing on the general well-being of the\r\nfamily, which again can be fostered by the creation of an\r\nenabling environment for growth and improvement in\r\nfamily incomes. Moreover, arrangements like “homes” are\r\ngenerally shunned, as in my own country, in addition to\r\nthe difficulty of sustaining them adequately in weak\r\neconomies. Of course, institutions that give training in\r\nspecialized skills and adaptability, especially in the case\r\nof disabled children, will continue to play an important\r\nrole in the overall integration of those special social\r\ngroups.\r\nSuccessful arrangements for social development are\r\nbuilt on the strength of family units. Weak families\r\nresulting from economic impoverishment may be a source\r\nof larger dislocation and conflicts in social set-ups. In\r\nfact, conflicts can be traced to socioeconomic inequalities.\r\nAction should therefore be targeted at bridging socio-\r\neconomic gaps by such measures as those aimed at\r\nraising incomes of the most vulnerable societies, so that\r\nthe bare minimum requirements of life, such as food,\r\nhealth, education and shelter — are assured. This is the\r\nchallenge to all of us, the United Nations system, the\r\nmultilateral institutions and other actors in the\r\ndevelopment field.\r\nLastly, a working group under the auspices of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council was set up to prepare a\r\ndraft World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year\r\n2000 and Beyond. Negotiations have been going on, but\r\nnot without difficulties. In the view of my delegation, the\r\nProgramme of Action that is adopted by this Assembly\r\nshould be in the interests of the youth, taking into account\r\nthe cultural and social diversities of all Member States.\r\nThe President: I would like to appeal again to all\r\nspeakers to keep their statements as brief as possible.\r\nI now call on the representative of Singapore,\r\nMr. Seng.\r\nMr. Seng (Singapore): The tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year, which we are observing here\r\ntoday, is an opportunity for us collectively to take stock\r\nof past achievements and think about future directions\r\nregarding the situation of youth.\r\nInternational Youth Year has made two important\r\ncontributions. First, it has succeeded in raising awareness\r\namong the public and decision makers throughout the\r\nworld regarding the situation of youth. This is important,\r\nbecause in 1995 the world youth population is estimated\r\nto number 1.03 billion, or 18 per cent of the total world\r\npopulation. This figure is expected to grow in the coming\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nyears, especially in the developing countries. Besides their\r\nnumerical significance, youth in all countries represent a\r\nmajor human resource for economic development. They are\r\nalso the building blocks of their societies. It is often said\r\nthat the youth of today will be the leaders of tomorrow.\r\nTherefore, it is important that International Youth Year has\r\nsucceeded in giving priority to youth issues in the national\r\nagendas of many countries.\r\nSecond, International Youth Year was also\r\ninstrumental in laying the foundation for what is to become\r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year\r\n2000 and Beyond. The three themes of International Youth\r\nYear, which are “participation, development, and peace”,\r\nprovided the starting point for the draft Programme of\r\nAction. Much time and effort have gone into its\r\npreparation. As a forward-looking document, it can serve as\r\na useful guide for countries to plan and develop their\r\nnational programmes. It is also a recognition by the\r\ninternational community that the hopes, needs and concerns\r\nof youth deserve attention at the national and international\r\nlevel.\r\nSingapore joins the international community in\r\ncelebrating the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\nYear. The National Youth Council of Singapore has\r\norganized a wide range of activities to commemorate the\r\noccasion. The activities have included an Asian Regional\r\nYouth Conference on the Environment; the International\r\nScouts Conference; and a special commemorative issue of\r\nStatistics on Youth that will trace the development of\r\nSingaporean youth in the past decade. To help publicize\r\nthis wide array of activities, a special package has been\r\nproduced for distribution to schools and youth groups in\r\nSingapore. Today I am pleased to be able to share this\r\npackage with delegates.\r\nIn Singapore, the National Youth Council is the\r\nGovernment agency which makes youth its main focus. It\r\nlooks at policies, programmes and activities from the\r\nperspective of youth. It serves as the focal point for\r\ndiscussions or debates on youth matters and acts as a\r\ncatalyst to initiate new programmes and activities. It also\r\ncoordinates programmes nationwide so that duplication and\r\noverlap are minimized. Finally, the National Youth Council\r\nprovides communication channels for the youth to express\r\ntheir views and opinions on current issues.\r\nIt has been 10 years since the first International Youth\r\nYear was celebrated in 1985. Today’s youth live in quite a\r\ndifferent world from that of 10 years ago. In particular,\r\nthere are two trends which I would like to address. First,\r\nsince the end of the cold war we have witnessed a\r\nresurgence in ethnic-religious conflicts in many parts of\r\nthe world. Far from being extinguished, primordial forces\r\nremain very strong.\r\nIn a multiracial and multireligious society such as\r\nSingapore, we have to be vigilant against ethnic and\r\nreligious chauvinism. Therefore, mutual understanding\r\nand tolerance among people of different social, racial and\r\nreligious backgrounds are encouraged. In Singapore,\r\ncompulsory national service in the military, police force\r\nor civil defence authorities has played an extremely\r\nimportant role in forging common links, fostering shared\r\nvalues and a sense of nationhood among young people\r\nfrom diverse backgrounds. During national service, young\r\nmen at the age of 18, regardless of race, religion, or\r\nsocial and economic background, spend between two and\r\ntwo and a half years living and working together.\r\nThereafter, they serve in the reserve for a further 20 to 30\r\nyears, meeting regularly. In the process, they learn not\r\nonly how to defend the country, but also how to live\r\nharmoniously with each other.\r\nThere are also a variety of youth organizations in\r\nSingapore which bring together young people from\r\ndifferent races and backgrounds. The biggest of these is\r\nthe People’s Association Youth Movement which has 81\r\nbranches and more than 100,000 members. The Singapore\r\nGovernment actively supports the activities of youth\r\norganizations in Singapore to bring young people together\r\nto participate in meaningful activities. An example is the\r\nYouth Development Fund, which was established in 1993\r\nwith a S$3 million endowment fund to promote youth\r\nprojects which benefit society. More than 20 projects have\r\nbeen carried out under the sponsorship of the Youth\r\nDevelopment Fund. They span a wide spectrum, ranging\r\nfrom environmental projects to organizing concerts for the\r\ndisabled.\r\nA second project is Project E, which stands for\r\n“explore, endeavour, experience and expedition”. It was\r\nalso launched in 1993 with a S$5.2 million grant from the\r\nGovernment to encourage youth to venture beyond\r\nSingapore and to participate in outdoor activities. To date,\r\nmore than 600 overseas expeditions and adventure\r\nprogrammes involving more than 12,000 participants have\r\nbeen organized. By providing channels for youth from\r\ndifferent backgrounds to participate together in worthy\r\nand meaningful activities, we hope that the youth of\r\nSingapore will learn mutual understanding and religious\r\ntolerance.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nThe last 10 years have also witnessed significant\r\nadvances in information technology. Besides television and\r\nother forms of mass media, the revolution in electronic\r\nmultimedia will have a significant impact on how young\r\npeople acquire their knowledge, values and modes of\r\nbehaviour. Increasingly, we are living in a borderless world\r\nwhere resources, ideas and information move freely, very\r\noften through cyberspace. The Internet, in particular, will\r\nbecome a powerful influence on youth. The Internet now\r\nhas over 30 million subscribers and attracts more than a\r\nmillion new ones every month. While the Internet is\r\ninvaluable as a global network for the exchange of\r\ninformation, it is also open to abuse. For example, most of\r\nus will have read about how paedophiles have established\r\ntheir own meeting corner on the Internet. There are also\r\nworrying reports of youth gaining access to pornography on\r\nthe Internet.\r\nWe could respond to the problem in two ways. One\r\nwould be to avoid the problem by restricting young\r\npeople’s access to the Internet. However, this is both\r\nimpractical and untenable. Such a response would be\r\ntantamount to throwing away the baby with the bath water.\r\nAnother way is to educate youth on the healthy use of the\r\nInternet. In Singapore, the National Youth Council has\r\nchosen the latter course. It has introduced two electronic\r\ncommunication programmes. One is called Talkshop Café,\r\nwhich is an electronic forum page for young people to\r\nshare their views on current topics. The second is called\r\nInfoYouth which puts together under one roof all the\r\ninformation on youth organizations, programmes and\r\nactivities in Singapore.\r\nIn Singapore, we regard young people as an important\r\nasset of our society. The youth of today are the leaders who\r\nwill take Singapore into the next century. Countries which\r\nignore their young people do so at their own peril. The\r\nconcerns of youth deserve our attention. The needs of youth\r\ndeserve our investment. The hopes of youth deserve our\r\nencouragement.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nMalta, Mr. John M. Demanuele, the Director for Youth\r\nAffairs, Ministry for Justice and the Arts.\r\nMr. Demanuele (Malta): In increasing the\r\neffectiveness of development policies and implementation\r\nprogrammes, it is vital that young people and their potential\r\ncontribution to development remain high on the agenda of\r\nGovernments. Since national situations vary, policies and\r\nprogrammes for youth should be tuned to meet the\r\nexigencies of the country in question within the\r\nparameters set by United Nations guidelines.\r\nRecognizing the role and needs of young people, the\r\nUnited Nations has spurred Member States into paying\r\nincreased attention to youth and their vital contribution to\r\ndevelopment aspirations. Declaring 1985 as International\r\nYouth Year was meant to set the mark on programmes\r\nand policies to elevate the status of young people through\r\nappropriate Government action as well as increased\r\nparticipation by youth non-governmental organizations in\r\nthe process of co-management and decision-making.\r\nThat year brought together our national organizations\r\nconcerned with youth matters under the umbrella of the\r\nNational Committee for the International Youth Year and\r\nmore importantly provided the opportunity to realize the\r\nneed for coordinated efforts in the development of youth\r\nprogrammes.\r\nToday, 10 years later, we live in a world of\r\ncontinuous change. The old continent of Europe is\r\nshaping a new image thanks to the action of institutions\r\nsuch as the European Union and the Council of Europe.\r\nWithin these organizations young people have the\r\nopportunity to search for a clear identity, a stable present\r\nand a better future. Young people and youth organizations\r\nare playing an important part in the process of European\r\nintegration. World wide, young people aspire to be\r\ncornerstones in the shaping and building of one great\r\nglobal village made not of utopian aspirations but of\r\nconcrete opportunities for a better life.\r\nThis new world, even more than that of today,\r\nshould be marked by a freer flow of information, persons,\r\ngoods, services and communications. Young people are\r\nrightfully concerned about the future, because this new\r\nglobal village will be the reality of their everyday life in\r\ndays to come. Key players in this new scenario are young\r\npeople and youth organizations. In facing the challenge of\r\nbuilding a better social and economic environment, they\r\nare on the same footing as politicians and decision\r\nmakers, and therefore demand to be considered as real\r\npartners.\r\nWe live the reality of an ongoing revolution in the\r\ntraditional way of life with new technologies, exchanges\r\nat all levels, global interdependence and new social and\r\nideological conflicts. In the search for their personal and\r\ncultural identity, young adults want to contribute and to\r\nplay an important social role. Their attitude is not\r\nantagonistic. They want to contribute and be part of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nsociety, making it a place with which they can better\r\nidentify themselves and become involved and committed.\r\nNationalistic, monocultural social concepts have become\r\nmultinational and multicultural. Diversity is an enrichment,\r\nnot a reason for intolerance, racism or xenophobia.\r\nSome tend to believe that a large number of young\r\npeople, especially in the more affluent countries, are\r\nwithdrawing from politics and public affairs. Others feel\r\nthat young people are unmotivated, apathetic, individualistic\r\nand self-centred and have lost enthusiasm for promoting\r\nsocial values. Economic well-being and ideological and\r\ncultural conflicts influence and affect young people’s lives,\r\nparticularly when complex societies are characterized by the\r\nabsence of social prospects and contradictions within the\r\nsocial system. In a consumer society, young people appear\r\nto live with the single objective of possessing the ever more\r\nsophisticated goods constantly coming onto the market.\r\nElsewhere, young people face far different prospects and\r\nobjectives. Some countries continue to be characterized by\r\nendemic and pervasive poverty, economic recessions and\r\narmed conflicts compounded by debilitating or fatal\r\nillnesses.\r\nIt is no longer possible to speak of young people as a\r\nsingle group with common expectations. They view and\r\nlive society differently because they are experiencing\r\ndifferent realities and situations in a socio-economic and\r\ncultural context of which there is no standard image. Young\r\npeople constitute the group that is potentially the hardest hit\r\nin any economic recession. School-leavers have problems\r\nbuilding careers and securing appropriate qualifications.\r\nThey expect to find a job and become independent, but they\r\nare also very selective concerning their job expectations.\r\nSometimes young people become tired of living in a\r\nsociety based on permanent competition. They reject a\r\nschool and university system based on competition and\r\nprefer a system based on the recognition of every\r\nindividual’s abilities. This situation is understandable,\r\nbecause after years of study and training, young people\r\ncannot afford to find a place in a society which seems to\r\nreject them.\r\nYouth unemployment raises another problem: that of\r\nyoung people’s place in society and the issue of social and\r\noccupational integration. Extended education increases their\r\ndependence on their elders, and unemployment aggravates\r\nthis. This situation leads to prolonged financial and social\r\ndependence and makes it difficult for young people to\r\ndevelop their personal autonomy.\r\nYoung people feel that the path to take is that of a\r\nsearch for identity through cultures, lifestyles and forms\r\nof expression, in order to feel in harmony with the world\r\naround them. Speaking out is one way for them to play\r\nan active part in the community. This is where the role of\r\nyouth non-governmental organizations becomes important.\r\nYoung people join forces to reflect on the problems they\r\nencounter and then to act on them. By being members of\r\nyouth organizations, by committing themselves and\r\nparticipating in society, they look for social progress and\r\nevolution in a society where freedom of the individual is\r\nlinked to participation in collective life.\r\nYouth today have a vision which sees them\r\nprojected towards the future. They also have a remarkable\r\npower of influence on public opinion. Young people are\r\nthe richest resource of our society.\r\nParticipation is the optimum medium through which\r\nwe can build tomorrow’s society. This process encourages\r\nyoung people to remain within, integrate into and lead\r\nfuller lives in society, where they can find ideas with\r\nwhich they can identify and to which they are willing to\r\ncommit themselves. Participation provides training in\r\ndemocracy and helps them become accepted as a resource\r\nrather than viewed as a problem. It is more than a\r\nquestion of involvement in institutions and decision-\r\nmaking. It is vital to stress at this point the role of youth\r\norganizations in participation. They can provide the links\r\nat the social, cultural, spiritual, economic and political\r\nlevels between youth and governmental institutions. Youth\r\norganizations give concrete expression to commitment and\r\nsignificance to solidarity by providing young people with\r\nthe opportunity to participate in the construction of the\r\nfuture.\r\nOn the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\nYear, the United Nations is, more than ever, fully aware\r\nof this role and commitment of youth organizations. Now\r\nmore than ever before, young people have to see\r\nthemselves as global citizens as well as national citizens.\r\nThe involvement of youth networks with United Nations\r\nprogrammes on subjects such as health, environment,\r\nemployment and disarmament is an important part of the\r\ninformation exchange and can also influence and even\r\ntransform these programmes. One hopes that the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year will be another\r\nstep on the road to joint projects between the United\r\nNations and youth organizations. Strength thrives on\r\nunity.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nYouth in the year 2000 will be living in a highly\r\ncompetitive world marked by cultural, economic, social and\r\npolitical upheavals. If young people are to cope with this\r\ndevelopment, they need to be acquainted with new\r\ntechnologies, learn languages and develop social and\r\ncultural understanding. Youth exchanges and the promotion\r\nof youth mobility are effective means to enable young\r\npeople to experience the world’s diverse cultural, linguistic\r\nand religious traditions. Young people are pushing back\r\nnational frontiers.\r\nIntergovernmental cooperation in the field of youth\r\nshould be a priority on Government agendas. It offers the\r\npossibility of sharing experience in combatting the\r\ndifficulties facing young people, acts as a barrier to\r\nxenophobia and racism and contributes to the building of\r\ndemocratic ideals. All young people must be given the\r\npossibility of living this formative experience. This,\r\nhowever, depends on the political will of governments and\r\non the consequent funding on a large scale which such\r\nmobility and exchange projects require.\r\nAn important matter of concern for Governments and\r\nyouth organizations is North-South relations, a vital\r\nproblem for the future of the world. Youth organizations\r\nand young people are very concerned about this, and try to\r\npromote interdependence and solidarity between the\r\ncountries of the North and the developing countries of the\r\nSouth.\r\nThe Government of Malta is fully aware of the\r\naspirations and rights of young people today. It encourages\r\na spirit of enterprise and academic attainment, provides the\r\ninfrastructure necessary for employment in various sectors\r\nand promotes exchange and mobility projects with various\r\ncountries. In collaboration with the National Youth Council\r\nand other bodies working in the youth field, it has produced\r\na national youth policy which seeks to set out the objectives\r\nto be achieved for youth in Maltese society and to provide\r\nguidelines for the implementation of these objectives.\r\nIt is the policy of the Government of Malta, as\r\noutlined in its national youth policy: to provide youth with\r\nequal opportunity to education free of any charge, including\r\neducation at the tertiary level, and to cultural formation\r\ndirected at enhancing personal growth; to seek to\r\nunderstand the just aspirations of youth and to direct its\r\nresources to their fulfilment; to integrate young people in\r\nthe mainstream of the social, political and economic life of\r\nthe country, recognizing them as a vital element of the\r\nfuture of the nation; to develop among youth a sense of\r\nintergenerational solidarity, cooperation among themselves\r\nand a commitment to those with special needs; to assist\r\nyoung people in the further development of a European\r\nconsciousness based on the creation of an awareness of a\r\ncommon European culture emanating from different\r\ntraditions; to instil in young people a spirit of self-\r\nconfidence and a belief in their ability to realize their\r\npotential in society; to nurture young people’s spirit of\r\naltruism and self-sacrifice and their attachment to ideals;\r\nto appreciate the importance of youth as a positive force\r\nfor change and renewal; to encourage the appreciation of\r\ncultural diversity and assist youth mobility as a major tool\r\nin furthering first-hand knowledge of different cultures\r\nand ways of life; and to endeavour to strengthen the\r\nmoral and spiritual values of young people.\r\nIn 1992, the University of Malta, following an\r\napproach from the Ministry responsible for youth, set up\r\nan Institute of Youth Studies. The Institute carries out\r\ncourses up to degree level for the training of qualified\r\npersonnel to work in the youth field. It carries out\r\nresearch on the situation of young people in Malta and\r\nprovides information and suggestions for furthering our\r\nyouth policy.\r\nThe establishment of youth centres is encouraged\r\nand supported, while most local councils cater for the\r\nneeds of young people through an office of a counsellor\r\nresponsible for youth affairs. The Government of Malta\r\nadopts policies assisting young people to find and own\r\ndecent housing, to seek profitable employment, to have\r\naccess to all necessary data and means to further their\r\nhealthy well-being, to assist young people with special\r\nneeds, marginalized youth and youth at risk, to overcome\r\ntheir difficulties and recover their self-esteem.\r\nLast year, the Government of Malta, together with\r\nthe National Youth Council, hosted the first-ever Euro-\r\nArab youth conference, which confirmed Malta’s rightful\r\naspirations as a cultural and political centre in the\r\nMediterranean, a focal point where diverging views and\r\npolicies may be freely discussed and analysed. These\r\npolicies being pursued by the Government of Malta\r\nshould ensure the development of a solid base from which\r\nyoung people can launch their vision, hopes and\r\naspirations towards a better world of opportunities at the\r\nstart of the next millennium.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Mrs. Kaba.\r\nMrs. Kaba (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It gives me pleasure to take the opportunity of\r\nthe celebration of the tenth anniversary of International\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nYouth Year to stress the importance for Côte d’Ivoire of\r\nthe question of youth and the integration of young people\r\nin the process of the economic and social development of\r\nour country.\r\nYouth represent 18 per cent of the world population,\r\nthat is, 1.01 billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age;\r\n84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and\r\nrepresent a challenge within the context of the economic\r\nand social crisis that rages in Africa, as well as representing\r\nthe enormous potential on which the future of our continent\r\nis based.\r\nSince 1985 — International Youth Year — the number\r\nof young people in the population of Africa has more than\r\ndoubled, rising from 42.2 million to 105.2 million in 10\r\nyears. This growth tied to the almost chronic demographic\r\nexplosion in our country has not been accompanied by a\r\nproportionate increase in resources. On the contrary, the\r\ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa have gone through a period\r\nof economic recession aggravated by the drying up of the\r\nflow of external resources. Thus, the massive arrival of\r\nthese young people, some of them skilled, on the labour\r\nmarket has represented an additional burden for economies\r\nin recession that have undergone the inescapable treatment\r\nadministered by the international financial institutions. The\r\nconsequence of this is underemployment, unemployment for\r\nmost of those ejected by the school system, and real\r\nimpoverishment for all.\r\nIn most cases the health and education infrastructures\r\nhave not been able to meet the social and cultural needs of\r\nyoung people. The result of this has been a rural exodus,\r\nthe uncontrolled growth of major cities with the arrival of\r\nyoung people from the countryside in search of\r\nemployment, their marginalization, and consequently the\r\nsocial ills that we are all familiar with: drugs, juvenile\r\ndelinquency, crime and prostitution.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, although it gives priority to youth\r\nquestions in its economic and social policy, has not been\r\nspared by this phenomenon. My country has invested in\r\nhealth and education at all levels, provided sporting and\r\ncultural facilities, and granted study scholarships to\r\ndeserving students from modest circumstances. This made\r\nit possible, in the first two decades of independence, to\r\ncope successfully with our responsibilities for the young\r\npopulation. But the economic crisis of the last decade has\r\nmade it impossible to respond to all their needs.\r\nHowever, thanks to the slight economic recovery, the\r\nGovernment’s primary concern has been to give young\r\npeople outside the school system the opportunity to study\r\nand to learn a trade. Crafts, art, agriculture, fish breeding\r\nand various small trades have enabled these youngsters to\r\ntake their place in the economic development of our\r\ncountry. The task is big and the resources still modest,\r\nbut the Government of Côte d’Ivoire is working to absorb\r\nyouth unemployment by providing job opportunities.\r\nWhile youth are a challenge to our countries, they\r\nalso represent appreciable wealth when they are\r\nempowered to take their own future in hand. If this is to\r\nhappen, we must first listen to them and take account of\r\ntheir aspirations, their wishes and their vision of society.\r\nYoung people have an extraordinary capacity for\r\nmobilization, and they display real determination in\r\ndefending the causes that are dear to them. If this energy\r\ncan be channelled in the right direction through suitable\r\neducation, these young people can be the best vehicles for\r\nsuch values as tolerance, mutual understanding and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nYouth organizations in Europe are fighting against\r\nracial discrimination and are helping to mould a new\r\nworld in which differences will be accepted. It was young\r\npeople who fell in Soweto in the fight against apartheid.\r\nWe must enable young people to organize, to meet each\r\nother, to have exchanges with youth from other parts of\r\nthe world, so that they understand and appreciate each\r\nother better.\r\nMoreover, young people have a sense of innovation\r\nand creativeness that can be a valuable asset in devising\r\nand implementing policies for economic and social\r\ndevelopment. They deserve to be considered as fully\r\nfledged citizens and to have the chance to participate in\r\nall activities in order to cultivate their sense of\r\nresponsibility.\r\nWe can then be proud of our young people, for they\r\nwill be responsible, positive and creative, while retaining\r\nthe spontaneity that is the charm of youth.\r\nThe President: I now call on Ms. Malin Berggren,\r\nYouth Delegate of Sweden.\r\nMs. Berggren (Sweden): When I began to prepare\r\nfor this speech a couple of weeks ago I asked a close\r\nfriend what he thought I should say. “Well, Malin,” he\r\nsaid, “I had to write an essay in the eighth grade on the\r\nsubject ‘What I would say to the United Nations General\r\nAssembly if I ever had the chance’. Just read that.”\r\nToday, I actually have the opportunity of doing what\r\nmillions of young people would like to do: address the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. More than\r\nanything else, I wish to use this opportunity of\r\nparticipating here today to stress exactly that —\r\nparticipation. Participation of youth in all sectors of\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 October 1995\r\nsociety and in all areas of decision-making is the only way\r\nfor us to tackle the challenges that face young people.\r\nThis historic week started with a unique meeting of\r\nHeads of State and Government and, let us hope, will end\r\nwith the adoption of the draft World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond. In this Hall the\r\nHeads of State and Government stressed the need to reform\r\nthe United Nations to enable it better to meet the demands\r\nof today and tomorrow. I am convinced that we, the young\r\npeople, and our participation are an important part of the\r\nanswer. With our perspectives, energy and ideas, we can\r\ncontribute something positive, forward-looking and\r\nconstructive.\r\nDuring these days it has often been said that young\r\npeople are the future. That is true, but it is only part of the\r\ntruth. Young people are both actors and factors in society\r\nat present. With a greater sense of responsibility, we can\r\nalso feel greater commitment to the future. We, the young\r\npeople, must therefore be considered a resource, and not a\r\nproblem.\r\nWe are about to adopt — I really hope — the draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000\r\nand Beyond. I guess we all feel that the draft Programme\r\ncould have been better. However, let us consider it to be\r\nthe start, not the end, of a necessary process. It is now my\r\nhope, and the hope of the Swedish Government, that the\r\ndraft Programme will lead to a strengthened role for youth\r\nat all levels: local, national and international.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the draft World Programme\r\nof Action has taken into account the results achieved at the\r\nrecent conferences on environment in Rio, on human rights\r\nin Vienna, on population in Cairo, on social development\r\nin Copenhagen and on women in Beijing. Young people\r\nhave an unconventional wisdom that is needed when\r\ntackling the challenging results of these meetings. The draft\r\nWorld Programme of Action also stresses the need to\r\ninvolve youth in actions on all these issues.\r\nThe implementation of the draft World Programme of\r\nAction will be the responsibility of Governments. It will\r\nrequire national mechanisms for integrated youth policies\r\nand programmes. It will also require — maybe most\r\nimportant — possibilities for young people to participate in\r\nthe implementation.\r\nSo, how does the United Nations measure up to the\r\ntasks set out in the draft World Programme of Action? It is\r\nmy opinion that the present United Nations machinery for\r\nyouth does not give young people sufficient possibilities\r\nto influence the work of the Organization. The United\r\nNations needs effective channels of communication\r\nbetween youth organizations and the entire United\r\nNations system — channels for talk but, even more,\r\nchannels for action; channels for, by and together with\r\nyoung people. In this context, Sweden strongly supports\r\na United Nations youth forum with a great influence by\r\nyouth organizations in all stages of the process.\r\nHaving highlighted the importance of participation\r\nby youth, I also want to point out one specific area where\r\nyoung people do not want to participate. That is war.\r\nYouth has no future in war. Conflict prevention\r\nprogrammes for and by young people will enhance our\r\nrole in preventing war. Youth organizations can be\r\nconsulted on fact-finding, contribute to early warning and\r\nshape the very political will at home that can bring our\r\nGovernments to action.\r\nThis year, which marks the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations and the tenth anniversary of\r\nInternational Youth Year, is one full of talk of reform and\r\nof promise for the future. The future is here today — in\r\nschools, in homes, in playgrounds and in this Hall. I urge\r\nyou to look, and to listen to it.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: On the morning of Tuesday, 31\r\nOctober 1995, the Assembly will take up, as the first\r\nitem, agenda item 48, entitled “Question of the Falkland\r\nIslands (Malvinas)”.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
