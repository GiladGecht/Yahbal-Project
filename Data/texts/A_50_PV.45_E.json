(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Peerthum\r\n(Mauritius), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 48\r\nQuestion of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nrepresentatives that following consultations regarding\r\nagenda item 48, on the question of the Falkland Islands\r\n(Malvinas), and taking into account General Assembly\r\ndecision 49/408 of 3 November 1994, it is proposed that\r\nthe General Assembly decide to postpone consideration of\r\nthis item and to include it in the provisional agenda of its\r\nfifty-first session.\r\nMay I take it therefore that the Assembly, taking into\r\naccount decision 49/408, wishes to defer consideration of\r\nthis item and to include it in the provisional agenda of the\r\nfifty-first session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has\r\nthus concluded its consideration of agenda item 48.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other\r\nelections:\r\n(c) Election of seven members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination: note by the\r\nSecretary-General (A/50/209)\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly decision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the\r\nAssembly elects the members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination upon their nomination by\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/50/209,\r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee\r\nwhich will occur as a result of the expiration on 31\r\nDecember 1995 of the terms of office of China, Egypt,\r\nJapan, Kenya, Nicaragua, the Republic of Korea and\r\nTogo. Those States are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that after 1 January\r\n1996 the following States will still be members of the\r\nCommittee: Argentina, Bahamas, Belarus, Benin, Brazil,\r\nCameroon, Canada, Comoros, Congo, Cuba, France,\r\nGermany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan,\r\nRomania, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland and the United States of America.\r\nTherefore, those 27 States are not eligible in this election.\r\nThe following States have been nominated by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council: three African States for\r\nthree vacancies — Egypt, Togo and Zaire; three Asian\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nStates for three vacancies — China, Japan and the Republic\r\nof Korea; and one Latin American and Caribbean State for\r\none vacancy — Uruguay.\r\nThe number of States nominated from among the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States, and the Latin America and\r\nCaribbean States corresponds to the number of seats to be\r\nfilled in each of those regions.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the General Assembly’s\r\nrules of procedure, all elections should be held by secret\r\nballot. However, in accordance with paragraph 16 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the Assembly may, in elections to\r\nsubsidiary organs, dispense with secret balloting when the\r\nnumber of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to\r\nbe filled.\r\nAccordingly, may I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto declare those States nominated by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council — namely; China, Japan, Egypt, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Togo, Uruguay and Zaire — elected\r\nmembers of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination for a three-year term beginning on 1 January\r\n1996?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate the States which\r\nhave been elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (c) of\r\nagenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 45\r\nThe situation in Central America: procedures for the\r\nestablishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress\r\nin fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/50/517)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.7/Rev.1)\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/50/700)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nMexico to introduce the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nhave the honour to introduce, on behalf of the sponsor\r\ncountries, the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/50/L.7/Rev.1, entitled “Mission of the United Nations\r\nin El Salvador”.\r\nAfter years of violence and uncertainty, El Salvador\r\nhas now reached the stage of consolidating the peace\r\nprocess, building and strengthening political, economic\r\nand social institutions and improving structures for\r\nharnessing, through dialogue and reason, the pluralism\r\nand differences inherent in all contemporary societies.\r\nWith the support of the United Nations, Salvadorans\r\ncarried out an intensive negotiating process that\r\nculminated in the signing of the Peace Agreement at\r\nChapultepec. At that time the stage of implementation and\r\nverification was initiated, with the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador\r\n(ONUSAL) from 1991 to 1995 and, as of 1 May 1995,\r\nwith that of the Mission of the United Nations in El\r\nSalvador (MINUSAL).\r\nThe draft resolution before the Assembly makes\r\nreference to the most recent resolutions and reports\r\nrelating to the situation in El Salvador. It recognizes with\r\nsatisfaction the continuing evolution of El Salvador into\r\na democratic and peaceful nation. It also acknowledges\r\nthe contributions made by Member States for the\r\nfunctioning of the Mission. The draft resolution welcomes\r\nthe continued commitment of the Government and the\r\npeople of El Salvador to the consolidation of the peace\r\nprocess. It praises the work done by MINUSAL and the\r\nSecretary-General. It recognizes the political commitment\r\nof the Government of El Salvador and other parties to\r\ncomplete the implementation of the agreements.\r\nOn that basis, the draft resolution approves the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to extend MINUSAL’s\r\nmandate, with a gradual reduction of its strength and\r\ncosts in a manner compatible with the efficient\r\nperformance of its functions. Finally, it calls on Member\r\nStates and international institutions to continue to provide\r\nEl Salvador with assistance and support in the\r\nconsolidation of peace and development.\r\nThe sponsors of draft resolution A/50/L.7/Rev.1 are\r\nconvinced that its adoption would demonstrate the\r\ninternational community’s renewed commitment to peace,\r\nstability and development in El Salvador. We are\r\nconfident that the Assembly will give the draft resolution\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nits full support, and we strongly recommend that it be\r\nadopted.\r\nMr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe European Union has taken note of the report\r\n(A/50/517) of the Secretary-General of 6 October 1995 on\r\nEl Salvador and, in particular, on the role of the new\r\nMission of the United Nations in El Salvador (MINUSAL).\r\nThe mediation process, the determination of the parties\r\nand the commitment to peace of the people of El Salvador,\r\nassisted by the presence of the United Nations Observer\r\nMission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and the work of the\r\nGroup of Friends, made it possible to put an end to the\r\nbloody civil conflict in El Salvador. This historic success\r\nwas enshrined in the Chapultepec agreements of January\r\n1992. During the past few years, we have witnessed with\r\nsatisfaction the transition in El Salvador from a conflict\r\nsituation to one of peace and reconciliation.\r\nToday the population of El Salvador as a whole is\r\ndeeply involved in the process of normalizing the country’s\r\npolitical life, which will make it possible to lay the\r\nfoundations of a stable democracy in a climate of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe European Union congratulates the Government of\r\nEl Salvador and the other political forces in the country for\r\nthe progress achieved in complying with the provisions of\r\nthe Chapultepec peace agreements and the recommendations\r\nof the Commission on the Truth.\r\nEl Salvador must continue to receive assistance from\r\nthe international community. The presence of MINUSAL\r\nsince 1 May 1995 — first under the leadership of the\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Enrique ter Horst, whose work we wish to praise, and\r\nnow under that of Mr. Ricardo Vigil — has enabled the\r\nUnited Nations to continue to exercise its good offices and\r\nhas helped inspire confidence in the ongoing process of\r\nconsolidating progress through the strengthening of El\r\nSalvador’s democratic institutions as well as in the full\r\nimplementation of the peace agreements.\r\nThe European Union supports MINUSAL’s presence\r\nin El Salvador, which contributes effectively to overcoming\r\nthe obstacles still in the way of the full implementation of\r\nthe peace agreements. It therefore agrees with the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal — included in the draft\r\nresolution (A/50/L.7/Rev.1) before us, which was just\r\nintroduced by the representative of Mexico — to extend\r\nMINUSAL’s mandate for six months, with a gradual\r\nreduction of its strength and costs in a manner compatible\r\nwith the effective performance of its duties.\r\nWe consider this necessary, not only because of the\r\nimportant and encouraging political message this decision\r\nwill send to El Salvador, but also because we are\r\nconcerned that some aspects of the peace agreements are\r\nnot being fully implemented and others have been subject\r\nto considerable delays. Swifter progress is needed in order\r\nto avoid weakening the peace process and causing\r\npolitical and social instability.\r\nThe European Union wishes to stress the importance\r\nof implementing reforms in the judicial system, in\r\nparticular the legislative reforms required for the\r\nimplementation of the binding recommendations of the\r\nCommission on the Truth, as well as in the electoral\r\nsphere and in the human-settlement and land-transfer\r\nprogrammes.\r\nFurthermore, the increase in delinquency, especially\r\nthe organized kind, and the deterioration of public\r\nsecurity are elements of concern. Efforts to counter\r\ndelinquency must be made in conjunction with the\r\ninstitutional development of the National Civil Police and\r\nthe National Public Security Academy. The concept of a\r\nnational civil police force, as embodied in the peace\r\nagreements, must be preserved and sustained. To this end,\r\nthe European Union is providing technical and financial\r\nassistance to these mechanisms.\r\nThe draft resolution which the General Assembly has\r\nbefore it today, and which we trust will be adopted by\r\nconsensus, clearly shows the political will of the\r\ninternational community to consolidate the recent\r\nachievements of the people of El Salvador through the\r\nfull implementation of the peace agreements.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.7/Rev.1. The report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee on the programme budget implications of the\r\ndraft resolution is contained in document A/50/700.\r\nBefore we proceed to take action on the draft\r\nresolution, I should like to announce that the following\r\ncountries have become co-sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.7/Rev.1: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Belize,\r\nBrazil, Canada, Denmark, the Dominican Republic,\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,\r\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nPortugal, the Russian Federation, Sweden, the United\r\nKingdom and Uruguay.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.7/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.7/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 50/7).\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nEl Salvador.\r\nMr. Castaneda (El Salvador) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The development of events in Central America\r\nhas been considered by the Security Council and, in\r\nparticular, the General Assembly since 1983, when the\r\nagenda item entitled \"The situation in Central America:\r\nthreats to international peace and security and peace\r\ninitiatives\" was introduced and more directly since the\r\nsigning of the Esquipulas II agreements in 1987 and the\r\ncommitments adopted at the El Salvador Summit in\r\nFebruary 1989, when our Governments agreed to ask the\r\nUnited Nations to take the necessary steps to put into\r\noperation a mechanism for the verification of the\r\ncommitments aimed at securing a political solution to the\r\nregional crisis. This then took the form of various initiatives\r\nwhich were developed in the field and which led to\r\nprogress in the peace process, thus moving us away from\r\nconfrontation and towards efforts to consolidate a region of\r\npeace, freedom, democracy and development.\r\nThe initiatives aimed at finding a political solution to\r\nthe armed conflict in El Salvador were also taken in their\r\ncontext. We should recall that in December 1990 both the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí\r\npara Liberación Nacional (FMLN) asked the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to exercise his good offices in the search for peace.\r\nHis participation in the negotiations was then formally\r\nestablished in the Geneva agreement of 4 April 1990.\r\nSince then, negotiations have been held with the\r\nassistance and good offices of the Secretary-General,\r\ndirectly or through his Special Representative. This\r\nlaunched the widest possible process for the maintenance of\r\npeace in Central America, and a mechanism was introduced\r\nto monitor implementation of the agreements resulting from\r\nthe negotiations — the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nEl Salvador (ONUSAL), initially with the limited task of\r\nverifying the San José Agreement on Human Rights of July\r\n1990, and then with the more extensive task of verifying\r\nimplementation of the peace agreements of January 1992\r\nwhich ended the armed conflict, and subsequently to\r\nbegin the consolidation of peace and democratization,\r\nthereby achieving national reconciliation and the integral\r\ndevelopment of our country in an atmosphere of full\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nAs we are all aware, the implementation of the\r\npeace agreements and the progress made to that end were\r\nthe basis for ending ONUSAL’s mandate. However, it\r\nwas also felt that a reduced United Nations presence\r\nshould be maintained to continue observing and verifying\r\nthe implementation of pending commitments.\r\nTo that end, once ONUSAL’s mandate terminated,\r\nin April 1995, provision was made for the new Mission\r\nof the United Nations in El Salvador (MINUSAL), which\r\ncame into operation as of 1 May 1995, to continue the\r\nverification functions and exercise its good offices until\r\nthere is full implementation of the peace agreements.\r\nIn respect of the pending commitments, I believe it\r\nis appropriate to remind this Assembly that in October\r\n1995 we reached an agreement between the political\r\nparties and other competent institutions making it possible\r\nto appoint the Inspector General of the new National Civil\r\nPolice, in accordance with the peace agreements. We have\r\nalso continued to implement the land transfer programme\r\nand the programme to reintegrate former combatants from\r\nboth parties into the civilian and institutional life of our\r\ncountry, thereby demonstrating the concern and firm\r\npolitical will of the Government of El Salvador fully to\r\ncomply with the commitments in the peace agreements.\r\nIt should be pointed out, in relation to the\r\nstrengthening of the National Civil Police, that MINUSAL\r\nrequested the President of the Republic to evaluate the\r\npresent situation of public security in our country. The\r\nrequest also contained a proposal and recommendations\r\nfor improvements in this area, which also shows the work\r\nbeing done and the level of confidence that has been\r\nearned by MINUSAL.\r\nThe process of transforming El Salvador’s society\r\nfrom a semi-authoritarian and semi-democratic political\r\nsystem into a modern democratic political system with\r\nfull respect for the human, political, social, civil and\r\neconomic rights of all members of our society has been\r\na national effort for the most part, but it would not have\r\nbeen possible to achieve this in the time in which we\r\nhave done so without the good offices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral as an intermediary, the resolute support of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nentire United Nations system, and the cooperation and\r\ntimely solidarity of the international community. We\r\ntherefore would like again to express our great appreciation\r\nand gratitude.\r\nWe are pleased that the Assembly has now adopted\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.7/Rev.1 by consensus because this\r\nconfirms the commitment by the United Nations to the\r\nconsolidation of peace and democratization in El Salvador,\r\nand to continued support by the international community for\r\nthe efforts made by our people and our Government to\r\nachieve a future of peace and prosperity for all Salvadorans.\r\nThe Acting President: We have concluded this stage\r\nof our consideration of agenda item 45.\r\nAgenda item 105 (continued)\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family: Commemoration to mark the\r\ntenth anniversary of International Youth Year\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Greece.\r\nMr. Kaskarelis (Greece): Last Friday, the\r\nrepresentative of Spain delivered a statement on behalf of\r\nthe European Union. Greece fully subscribes to the contents\r\nof that statement. I would like, however, to elaborate on\r\nsome issues which are of particular interest to my\r\ndelegation.\r\nThe year 2000 lies ahead of us. To be young and live\r\nat the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process\r\nof constant change all over the world and, at the same time,\r\nto encounter a cruelly competitive cultural, social, economic\r\nand political reality.\r\nOn the other hand, Governments responsible for the\r\nrealization of a youth policy in their respective countries are\r\nwell aware that youth problems have nowadays escaped the\r\nnarrow geographical borders of their States. Problems tend\r\nto be common to all young people on the planet.\r\nIn this framework, the concluding triptych of strategies\r\nof the 1985 International Youth Year: Participation,\r\nDevelopment, Peace, still remains critical and needs urgent\r\nimplementation through both national and international\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn a world witnessing rapid socio-economic change\r\nand a deepening of the differences between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, the most affected part of the\r\npopulation is youth, or “the forgotten quarter”, as it is\r\ndescribed by UNICEF. It is this part of the population\r\nwhich not only reflects the problems of contemporary\r\nsocieties but also projects the image of the future world.\r\nTherefore, it is by addressing the concerns, the needs, the\r\ndesires and the dreams of the youth of today that we will\r\nbuild a safer and healthier world for tomorrow.\r\nThere should be a specific approach to addressing\r\nthe specific problems of the youth population. Measures\r\nshould be taken to combat increased juvenile delinquency,\r\ndrug abuse and youth marginalization. Urgent measures\r\nare also needed against female infanticide, sale of\r\nchildren and organs, child prostitution, child pornography\r\nand all forms of sexual abuse. New policies should be\r\nintroduced to protect working children from exploitation\r\nand hazardous conditions that endanger their physical and\r\nmental development.\r\nThe lack of adequate opportunities for education,\r\ntraining and employment and poor facilities and services\r\nare factors which can fuel social exclusion and\r\nmarginalization; therefore they should be eliminated.\r\nYouth, being more vulnerable to disadvantages from\r\nwhich our society is suffering, should be especially\r\nprotected in priority areas such as health services,\r\nnutrition, education, safe water and adequate sanitation.\r\nIn a world of increased tensions and multiplying\r\npoints of conflict, special care should be taken to protect\r\nand assist children in war areas and to rehabilitate\r\nchildren traumatized by war and natural disasters.\r\nSpecific programmes should be studied and\r\neffectuated in order to combine efforts for a better\r\nenvironment with endeavours for a better future for our\r\nchildren, to whom this future mostly belongs.\r\nWe join our voice to that of other countries in the\r\nworld, for: active cooperation between governmental\r\nauthorities and non-governmental organizations;\r\nstrengthening of ties between Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations, in the knowledge that it is only through\r\nsolidarity that we can resolve pressing problems facing\r\nyouth all over the world; urgent, universal ratification of\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child; universal\r\nsignature of the World Declaration on the Survival,\r\nProtection and Development of Children and the Plan of\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nAction adopted by the World Summit for Children, as well\r\nas its effective implementation; and intensification of the\r\nrole of non-governmental organizations in the effective\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child.\r\nWe salute the United Nations initiative of dedicating\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly’s fiftieth session to\r\ncommemorating the tenth anniversary of International\r\nYouth Year, and we are certain that this endeavour will\r\nresult in many fruitful proposals concerning youth.\r\nIt is only by meeting young people’s needs and\r\naspirations that we can ensure a better future for all of us.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Australia.\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): Last week the General\r\nAssembly convened in special meetings to commemorate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Those\r\nmeetings saw the largest gathering of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment ever held. The past was reviewed but, more\r\nimportant, the focus was on the future.\r\nIt is deeply appropriate that as our first action\r\nthereafter we celebrate the tenth anniversary of International\r\nYouth Year, because it is the youth of today who will carry\r\nus into the next half-century of the United Nations and\r\nbeyond.\r\nWhile there is much to do at the local and national\r\nlevels, it is also vital that we address the issues of youth at\r\nthe international level. There is also much we must do\r\nglobally to improve the situation of youth. They have an\r\nimportant role to play at the international level. Youth\r\nthemselves are at the forefront of the ongoing process of\r\nthe globalization of our world. Youth everywhere must be\r\nencouraged to expand their links in international\r\ncooperation and communication.\r\nWe have a responsibility to create an enabling\r\nenvironment in which our best resources can flourish. We\r\nneed to create a world for youth characterized by equality\r\nof opportunity, freedom from hunger and poverty, freedom\r\nfrom violence and discrimination in all its forms, and\r\nfreedom from the threats of environmental degradation and\r\nnuclear weapons. These issues are of great concern to the\r\nyouth of Australia, as they are to those of other countries.\r\nAnd we must increasingly act together to address the\r\nspecific problems of youth related to health, employment,\r\ndrug abuse and delinquency — issues addressed in the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth.\r\nWe can only be successful in meeting these\r\nchallenges by including the contributions of youth in\r\nbuilding and designing their futures and providing them\r\nwith the opportunity to participate and express themselves\r\nfreely.\r\nThe challenges the world faces today are clearly\r\ndifferent from those we faced 10 years ago, at the time of\r\nInternational Youth Year. The recent major conferences\r\nand summits of the United Nations in the areas of\r\nwomen, social development, human rights, population,\r\nenvironment and development among others, have gone\r\na long way towards gathering momentum and identifying\r\nactions to address those issues. The resulting programmes\r\nand platforms for action have as much, if not more,\r\nrelevance for today’s youth as they do for all others. It is\r\nimperative that we now fulfil our commitments made at\r\nthose conferences by taking action. The draft World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth is an important adjunct\r\nto the framework of future activities set out in the\r\noutcomes of those recent major conferences. In our work\r\nto implement those outcomes we must continue to bear in\r\nmind the importance of youth.\r\nThe World Programme of Action on Youth must\r\nalso be a part of our national policies on youth. As\r\nexpressed in the World Programme, it is important that\r\nGovernments formulate and adopt national youth policies,\r\nas a means of addressing youth-related concerns.\r\nAustralia’s youth social justice strategy was\r\nintroduced to provide a special focus on youth in the\r\nGovernment’s broader social justice strategy, which aims\r\nat developing a fairer, more prosperous and just society\r\nfor all and is directed at expanding choices and\r\nopportunities to permit full participation in society, and to\r\nenable all to determine the direction of their own lives.\r\nAustralian Government policy focuses primarily on\r\nthe provision of assistance and support to all young\r\npeople in relation to employment, education and training,\r\nfinancial assistance, housing, health and a number of\r\nother issues specifically impacting upon young people.\r\nPrincipal features of Australia’s youth policies are:\r\nthe youth training initiative, which aims to assist early\r\nschool-leavers through an early intervention strategy and\r\nby providing access to case management; labour market\r\nprogrammes and a youth training allowance for\r\nunemployed 15- to 17-year-olds; Austudy, which aims to\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nprovide the financial assistance necessary for young people\r\nattempting to exercise their right to an education; pilot\r\nprogrammes targeting young people who are homeless or at\r\nrisk of becoming so; and special pilot projects designed to\r\nestablish best practice in youth suicide prevention.\r\nWe are now one year into the International Decade of\r\nthe World’s Indigenous People and it is our hope that the\r\nactivities of the Decade will have a particular impact on\r\nimproving the situation of the world’s indigenous youth. A\r\nhigh proportion of Australia’s aboriginal and Torres Strait\r\nIslander people are young. By the start of the 1990s, the\r\nmedian age for our aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\r\npeople was under 20 years of age, compared with over 30\r\nyears of age for the Australian population as a whole. This\r\nindicates that the heaviest burden of the disadvantages faced\r\nby our indigenous population are borne by its youth. The\r\nlegacy of past injustices is still evident in disturbing\r\nindicators of poor health, lower educational and\r\nemployment status, and disproportionately high levels of\r\nincarceration.\r\nThe Australian Government is comprehensively\r\nseeking to address the situation of its indigenous youth\r\nacross a range of processes and programmes, including\r\nspecific strategies in the areas of education, health services,\r\nin particular for the homeless, employment and training,\r\nsport and recreation, and youth access. We consider that the\r\nInternational Decade provides an additional framework for\r\nour own strong national efforts within which to achieve\r\nmeasurable and sustainable progress in partnership with our\r\nindigenous communities.\r\nThat is the central reality — partnership. It is only in\r\npartnership with our youth that we can hope to achieve real\r\nprogress in realizing the goals of International Youth Year:\r\nthe goals of participation, development and peace, and a\r\nbetter society for all toward the year 2000 and beyond.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of South Africa.\r\nMr. Mofokeng (South Africa): It is with boundless\r\njoy that the South African delegation addresses this special\r\nsession of the General Assembly commemorating the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year.\r\nThe youth in my country epitomize change and liberty.\r\nThe Government of National Unity declared 16 June as a\r\n“Day of the Youth”. That day symbolizes the uprising of\r\nthe youth against the evil system of apartheid, which was\r\nfound in my country. It was on the occasion of celebrating\r\nthat day that President Mandela announced the\r\nestablishment of the President’s Children Fund — a trust\r\nfund aimed at providing poverty-stricken and street\r\nchildren with resources that will ameliorate, if not\r\nannihilate, their miseries.\r\nMany Ministries of the Government of National\r\nUnity have appointed youth sector representatives to\r\nadvise and oversee efforts aimed at youth empowerment.\r\nLast November youth delegates from all corners of my\r\ncountry assembled at the behest of the Government of\r\nNational Unity. The object of that meeting was to give\r\nyoung men and women a chance to shape the\r\nGovernment’s approach to youth matters. For the first\r\ntime in the history of policy-making in South Africa, the\r\nGovernment met with youth representatives from the\r\npolitical organizations, non-governmental organizations,\r\nyouth clubs, student organizations and other bodies.\r\nThe Government was told that each and every\r\nprogramme aimed at youth empowerment must be\r\nunderscored by the principle of youth centrality. Aptly\r\nput, youth must be involved in all the stages leading\r\ntowards, and after, the adoption of such policies and\r\nprogrammes — that is, during the consultation, design\r\nand implementation periods.\r\nMost developing countries are faced with a\r\nmultiplicity of socio-economic problems that result in\r\nunemployment, lack of vocational skills, illiteracy,\r\neconomic stagnation, and other difficulties. Although\r\nthese problems affect all sectors of the population, young\r\nmen and women are the most hard hit.\r\nIt is our sincere belief that if there is to be any\r\nintervention, it should aim at addressing all these\r\nproblems simultaneously, in a systematic and realistic\r\nmanner. Furthermore, my Government has taken a\r\nconscious decision to target youth and women as the\r\nprimary beneficiaries of its reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment programme. Already youth are conspicuous\r\nin their participation in various projects, not only as\r\nbeneficiaries but also as policy-makers and managers.\r\nIt is worth noting that in many countries there are\r\nstill structural limitations, within different socio-economic\r\nformations, inhibiting youth development, such as\r\nobsolete values, policies and regulations. Governments\r\nmust open avenues for young people so that they can\r\nparticipate fully in every aspect of life.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nTo the young men and women of the world my\r\ndelegation would like to say that identifying problems is\r\none element in solving them. The other part is seizing the\r\ninitiative by rising above the problems. Correctly put, it is\r\nhigh time for young men and women to take their rightful\r\nplace in the struggle against problems that affect\r\nhumanity — whether women’s issues, drugs, environmental\r\nissues, sustainable development, or any other matter. We\r\nneed to see cooperation between young people in\r\ndeveloping countries and between young people from\r\ndeveloping and from developed countries.\r\nIt is said that the youth are the leaders of tomorrow,\r\nbut often they are never given a chance to occupy\r\nmeaningful positions today to prepare themselves to lead\r\ntheir respective communities. Let the youth give meaning\r\nto these words by preparing to lead their communities.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Andorra.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the pleasure and the great honour of being\r\nthe youngest ambassador and permanent representative\r\naccredited to the United Nations. It is therefore natural that\r\nI should speak today in this General Assembly meeting to\r\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of International Youth\r\nYear. Moreover, this is an opportunity that the Principality\r\nof Andorra holds dear for many reasons. First, Andorra is\r\na country with an age pyramid rather different from those\r\nof the other States of Western Europe. The ratio of young\r\npeople in the total population is much greater in our\r\ncountry than in neighbouring States. We are therefore well\r\naware of the problems and challenges facing youth today.\r\nSecondly, the Principality of Andorra is the author of one\r\nof the commitments of the Heads of State and Government\r\nincluded in the Final Declaration of the Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen in March this year:\r\n“[We heads of State and Government will]\r\nencourage the contribution of people of all age groups\r\nas equally and vitally important for the building of a\r\nharmonious society, and foster dialogue between\r\ngenerations in all parts of society”. (A/CONF.166/9,\r\nparas. 25 and 29, Commitment 4(h))\r\nThis commitment encompasses all generations. One\r\nmight think that something that is open to everyone\r\nconcerns no one. To the contrary, we in the Principality of\r\nAndorra believe that it is extremely useful to appraise the\r\nquestion of youth as part of a multi-generational whole. The\r\nworld of human beings is a dialogue between individuals\r\nand between groups of individuals — groups determined\r\nby people’s liking for one cause or another. There is\r\ntherefore dialogue between rich and poor, between one\r\nethnic group and another, between architects and\r\nengineers, or between any other groups of human beings.\r\nHowever, one of the oldest dialogues between\r\ngroups of people is that between generations — the\r\ntransmission of wisdom and accumulated knowledge\r\nbetween the old and the young. The human race has\r\ndeveloped through dialogue between generations.\r\nAlthough this must be preserved, we must prevent it from\r\nbecoming a monologue, for, while what our ancestors\r\npass on to us is wisdom, roots and knowledge, it is\r\npossible to contribute to the perpetuation of errors.\r\nIndeed, at a time when young people are killing each\r\nother in Bosnia and other places — when, after decades\r\nof shared life, new generations are massacring each other\r\non the pretext of past religious or other grudges — the\r\nindications are that dialogue between generations has not\r\nworked, that young people have not used their ability as\r\nhuman beings to understand, analyse and say no to the\r\nirrational struggles that have been inculcated by their\r\nelders.\r\nYoung people must be given every opportunity to\r\ndistinguish between kindness and cruelty, between the\r\nrational and the irrational, between good and evil,\r\nfollowing the logic of tolerance and freedom of the\r\nindividual. This can be achieved only through education.\r\nIt is therefore essential that the education systems of our\r\nworld communicate the message of peace and tolerance.\r\nYoung men and young women, despite their individual\r\ncharacteristics, are very impressionable beings — some\r\nmore so than others — and are therefore especially\r\nsusceptible to ideologies and fanaticism, both in terms of\r\ntheir capacity to absorb information and by way of\r\nimitation.\r\nIf we want the generations of the third millennium\r\nto be worthy of being called “human”, it is imperative\r\nthat the United Nations continue its efforts in the field of\r\neducation, through the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization and other worthy\r\nbodies. Today, at the end of the twentieth century, we are\r\nwell placed to want thoughtful education which will\r\ncommunicate to the young the values of the past but will\r\nalso enable them to guard against the mistakes of those\r\nwho have gone before them and give pride of place to\r\nreason and tolerance.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nSince I am speaking about tolerance, in this\r\nanniversary year dedicated to tolerance, I should like to\r\nrecall some words of my Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr.\r\nManuel Mas Ribo, a few weeks ago in the general debate:\r\n“Tolerance is limited only by intolerance.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 14th meeting, p. 15)\r\nFar too many young people are today victims of\r\nintolerance. By virtue of the colour of their skin or their\r\nbirth, sex, religion, views or any other condition arising\r\nfrom their personal or social situation, they are unable to\r\nexplore their freedom as individuals or enjoy the\r\npossibilities that life offers. We must see to it that an end\r\nis put to discrimination, especially the most insidious type\r\nof discrimination — that which comes from the nearest\r\nsources and which often drives young people to desperate\r\naction or, when there is no other motivation, to suicide. In\r\nfact, in the case of young people, suicide is always an\r\nindication of the failure of society to integrate them.\r\nAlthough it is true that all the ills to which I have just\r\nreferred affect other age groups too, it should not be\r\nforgotten that if we could manage to check them among\r\nyoung people we should avoid their repetition in the future.\r\nSo far, I have referred to what is needed to enable\r\nyoung people to reach their full human potential — that is,\r\nthe sum total of the values of tolerance and reason which\r\ntheir education must provide and which is therefore our\r\nconcern. In addition, young people must be able to make\r\nconstructive use in society of what they have learnt. This is\r\nsomething that can be imparted to them only up to a certain\r\npoint; they must themselves make the effort to become part\r\nof society and not to despair.\r\nSeveral weeks ago, in the Third Committee, I\r\ncommented that the Principality of Andorra is very\r\nconcerned about unemployment, which is dragging these\r\nnew generations towards the abyss of poverty and absence\r\nof social integration, to drugs and crime, because\r\nopportunities are lacking. We note with concern the\r\nstatistics showing that the lack of work is affecting young\r\npeople more tragically than other age groups. In the\r\ndeveloping countries the total labour force has increased by\r\nmore than 400 million units since the 1960s, and during\r\nthis decade it will increase by 2.3 per cent annually,\r\nnecessitating the creation of 260 million new jobs. As we\r\nhave noted several times, this is a fantastic challenge, but\r\nalso one of frightening magnitude.\r\nDialogue between the generations must be re-\r\nestablished so that young job-seekers do not push out\r\ntheir elders who have already benefited from the\r\nintegration of work. There will probably be a need to\r\njuggle work schedules or to create jobs with flexible\r\nhours so that workers can share the possibilities for\r\nemployment. In any case, that is a question to which we\r\nwill have to give active consideration.\r\nDuring the celebration of this fiftieth anniversary\r\nyear, the Principality of Andorra has paid a great deal of\r\nattention to youth and children. In the first half of 1995,\r\nI visited a school in Harlem, PS 206, in order to share the\r\nmessage of the United Nations with young people of New\r\nYork, the host city of our deliberations. A few weeks\r\nafter that meeting, Ambassador Marrero of the United\r\nStates and I opened this General Assembly Hall to those\r\nchildren to explain to them the purposes and possibilities\r\nof our Organization. In July, Andorra brought more than\r\n50 young members of its national choir to United Nations\r\nHeadquarters to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary through\r\nmusic. Later, in September, 10 young winners of the\r\nspecial prize of the National Committee for the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary were invited to visit the United Nations. The\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality also\r\nsigned the Convention on the Rights of the Child during\r\nhis stay in New York in early October. The Andorran\r\nParliament will soon decide on its ratification.\r\nI have received instructions and the means to move\r\nforward, on behalf of my country, on the question of\r\nyouth. Today, I assure the Assembly that this will happen.\r\nIt is essential that the United Nations do all in its power\r\nto ensure that the ideals of the 1945 Charter, based on a\r\nconcept of the human being endowed with freedom and\r\nreason, have real meaning for young people. The\r\nsalvation of our planet depends on this.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): On behalf of the State of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, I am pleased to participate in this special\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the\r\ntenth anniversary of International Youth Year, which\r\ncoincides with the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. That coincidence imbues the\r\noccasion with greater impetus and prospects for carrying\r\nout a review and assessment of the policies that have\r\nbeen adopted on the issue of youth at the national,\r\nregional and international levels.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nThe 10 years that have passed since the proclamation,\r\nin 1985, of the International Youth Year have witnessed\r\nmany speedy economic, political, social and cultural\r\ndevelopments which have impacted on all human\r\ncommunities and, in particular, the young, who number\r\nover 1 billion of the world’s inhabitants. Eighty-four per\r\ncent of those young people live in the developing countries,\r\nwhich suffer from hunger, poverty, unemployment,\r\nbackwardness, political instability and lack of security.\r\nThese negative phenomena have been reflected in the\r\ndelinquency, violence and extremism which afflict the\r\nsocieties of those developing countries, and which have\r\ncreated difficult problems that cannot be contained unless\r\nwe fully understand the problems of the young, their\r\naspirations and the important role they could play in the\r\nvarious spheres of international life. We live in an age that\r\nrequires us to innovate and to be creative in a manner that\r\nshould be inspired by our common values and the shared\r\nsense of responsibility towards our present and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nA few days ago, our Heads of State and Government\r\nmet in this very Hall to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. In the Declaration\r\nadopted on that occasion, they pledged to:\r\n“give to the twenty-first century a United Nations\r\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively\r\nthe peoples in whose name it was established”\r\n(A/50/48, p. 2)\r\nin the fields of peace, development, equality and justice.\r\nWe feel that none of this could be achieved unless we\r\naccord the highest priority to youth as principal partners in\r\nthis endeavour and as the cultural bridge between past,\r\npresent and future generations. While the international\r\ncommunity realizes that the young, with all their affiliations\r\nand cultural backgrounds are the principal human resource\r\nin the area of economic development and the effective\r\nelement of social change and scientific creativity, we feel\r\nan increasing anxiety towards the lot of youth, especially in\r\nthe countries of the developing world, where economic and\r\nsocial circumstances deprive them of the opportunities for\r\ntraining, education, employment, basic social services and\r\nhealth care. This leads to the emigration by large numbers\r\nof youth to more developed or wealthier countries, in\r\nsearch of better job opportunities, higher standards and\r\ndecent living. This has created clear imbalances in many\r\ncommunities, limited the possibilities of utilizing the\r\nenvironment and has thus widened the economic and social\r\ngap between the developed and the developing countries.\r\nThe leaders of the world — who recently committed\r\nthemselves here to participate effectively in reforming and\r\nrestructuring of the programmes and institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations, in strengthening its objectives, and in\r\nreorienting its policies, in serving the world’s peoples,\r\nespecially in the developing countries, have agreed that\r\nefforts should be deployed and steps should be taken\r\ntowards rehabilitating and educating the young and\r\nresponding to their needs. For the most part, these young\r\npeople have been used and exploited as tools of war,\r\narmed conflicts, violence, terrorism, drug trafficking and\r\norganized crime. Because the young are the makers,\r\nbeneficiaries and victims of social and economic changes,\r\nit has become extremely important to evolve the\r\nnecessary mechanisms and the sound comprehensive\r\ninternational approach to help support and improve the\r\nsituation of youth, especially in the poorer communities.\r\nIn so doing, consideration must be taken of cultural and\r\nsocial diversity, the religious teachings, customs and\r\ntraditions of each country, and the needs of every society\r\nin the areas of peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nProceeding from its belief that its youth are its real\r\nwealth and the mainstay of its present and future, and in\r\nresponse to the call by our Head of State, His Highness\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, the United Arab\r\nEmirates has always accorded a high priority, in\r\nformulating its development policies, to the question of\r\nyouth through the promulgation of legislation and the\r\nprovision of the basic requirements for putting in place\r\nthe best possible education curricula, health and social\r\nprogrammes, free of charge, as a service to the sons of\r\nour country, in line with our national systems and\r\nregional and international policies. At the same time, we\r\nhave striven to preserve the specific nature of our local\r\ncommunity, which derives its teachings from the tolerant\r\nsharia of Islam and the traditions of our society.\r\nIn the field of education, my country has made a\r\nnumber of qualitative and quantitative achievements, by\r\nputting in place comprehensive educational policies at all\r\nlevels, from primary education to university and post-\r\ngraduate levels.\r\nFurthermore, we have always made a point of\r\nproviding all health care services while improving their\r\nquality. We have also established many cultural and\r\nsports clubs and recreational centres. We have provided\r\nthe most advanced facilities for the disabled and for\r\nrehabilitation of delinquent youth. We have focused on\r\nimproving the situation of “underprivileged families”\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nhealthwise, economically and socially. We have also sought\r\nto create job opportunities for the youth of such families\r\nand have enabled them to take part in various missions\r\nabroad. We provide several types of assistance and support\r\nto many activities aimed at benefiting the young in many\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe major challenges that face today’s world and in\r\nparticular those that face the young, who shoulder the\r\nburden of preserving and developing the present and\r\nbuilding the future, make it incumbent on the international\r\ncommunity to work for the achievement of peace, progress\r\nand prosperity for all peoples by trying to pre-empt\r\nconflicts and improving the means of finding peaceful\r\nsolutions to current conflicts in consonance with the United\r\nNations Charter and the provisions of international law.\r\nWe must also make a great effort to combat poverty,\r\nbackwardness, social and economic problems and alleviate\r\nthe burden of debt, in order for the developing countries to\r\nmobilize the capabilities of their youth and, thereby, to\r\nallow them to participate fully in the development process.\r\nThis requires the United Nations to develop and update its\r\nprogrammes for youth which constitute the practical steps\r\nthat enhance their participation in the building of peace,\r\nsecurity and stability and in fostering the coexistence of the\r\nworld’s countries.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Suriname.\r\nMrs. Klein-Loebman Tobing (Suriname): I wish, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation, to take this opportunity during the\r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of International\r\nYouth Year to add the voice of our youth to the useful\r\ncontributions we have heard so far. I am very impressed\r\nwith the statements young people have made at these\r\nspecial commemorative meetings, in which they have urged\r\ntheir respective Governments and the international\r\ncommunity to involve youth when it comes to matters of\r\ndevelopment regarding youth so that the main theme of\r\nInternational Youth Year — “Participation, Development\r\nand Peace” — can become a reality. These young\r\nrepresentatives, who are the future of their countries, of our\r\ncountries, are right, and they deserve to be commended for\r\ntheir impressive messages.\r\nIn January 1995, the Government of Suriname\r\nestablished a tenth anniversary International Youth Year\r\nCommittee, which selected as its main theme, “Improving\r\nthe situation of youth by supporting their own initiatives”.\r\nSome of the activities of the Surinamese tenth-\r\nanniversary International Youth Year Committee so far\r\nhave been the organization of a National Youth\r\nConsultative Meeting in June 1995 and the convening on\r\n24 October 1995, United Nations Day, of a Youth\r\nAssembly, which focused on the problems of and\r\nsolutions for crime, prostitution, child labour, education,\r\nyouth and environment.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Suriname is of the\r\nview that we, the elders, must involve youth when it\r\ncomes to the formulation of policies, programmes and\r\ndecisions regarding them. My delegation would like to\r\nassure young people of our solidarity with their justified\r\ndesire for full participation, development and peace.\r\nIn this context, the draft World Programme of\r\nAction for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond\r\nconstitutes a sound basis and a good guideline for\r\ndeveloping essential activities in the interest of youth in\r\nsuch areas as education, employment, poverty, health,\r\nenvironment, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency.\r\nSuriname’s youth will gladly develop activities in these\r\nareas on the basis of this draft World Programme and,\r\nwherever possible and necessary, in close cooperation\r\nwith youth from other parts of the world.\r\nWe hereby appeal in particular to the representatives\r\nof donor countries and United Nations donor agencies to\r\nprovide the necessary resources, because with their\r\ngenerous contributions youth can fulfil their essential and\r\nnoble task of realizing peace, democracy and development\r\nfor all peoples all over the world.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the plenary meetings devoted to marking the\r\ntenth anniversary of International Youth Year.\r\nI should like to inform members that consideration\r\nof this item will be resumed later, at a date to be\r\nannounced.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 105.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning some changes in the\r\nprogramme of work.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 31 October 1995\r\nFirst, I should like to inform members that the report\r\nof the Second Committee to be considered under agenda\r\nitem 12, entitled “Report of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil”, will be taken up as the first item tomorrow\r\nmorning, Wednesday, 1 November 1995, as indicated in\r\ntoday’s Journal.\r\nThe consideration of agenda item 21, entitled\r\n“University for Peace”, scheduled as the first item for\r\nTuesday morning, 7 November, is postponed to a later\r\ndate, to be announced.\r\nAgenda item 25, entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem”, originally scheduled for consideration on\r\nThursday morning, 9 November, will now be the first\r\nitem for Wednesday morning, 15 November 1995.\r\nOn Monday, 27 November, agenda item 37, entitled\r\n“Zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic”,\r\nwill be added as the first item in the morning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 a.m.\r\n12\r\n"
