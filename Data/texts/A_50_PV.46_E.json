(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Abulhasan\r\n(Kuwait), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 12\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council: report of\r\nthe Second Committee (Part I) (A/50/615)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now turn to Part I of the report\r\n(A/50/615) of the Second Committee on agenda item 12,\r\n“Report of the Economic and Social Council”, dealing with\r\nrevision of the General Regulations of the World Food\r\nProgramme and reconstitution of the Committee on Food\r\nAid Policies and Programmes as the Executive Board of the\r\nWorld Food Programme.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to draw the attention\r\nof members to a note by the Secretary-General on the same\r\nsubject, which is contained in document A/50/706.\r\nI request the Rapporteur of the Second Committee,\r\nMr. Basheer Zoubi of Jordan, to introduce the report of the\r\nSecond Committee.\r\nMr. Zoubi (Jordan), Rapporteur of the Second\r\nCommittee: I have the honour to present part I of the report\r\nof the Second Committee on agenda item 12, entitled\r\n“Report of the Economic and Social Council”, which is\r\ncontained in document A/50/615.\r\nIn paragraph 5 of this document, the Second\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly the\r\nadoption of a draft resolution entitled “Revision of the\r\nGeneral Regulations of the World Food Programme and\r\nreconstitution of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and\r\nProgrammes as the Executive Board of the World Food\r\nProgramme”. The draft resolution was adopted by the\r\nCommittee without a vote.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nBefore taking action on the draft resolution, I wish to\r\npoint out that paragraph 1 would have the General\r\nAssembly decide, inter alia, subject to the concurrence of\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO), to reconstitute the Committee on Food\r\nAid Policies and Programmes as the Executive Board of\r\nthe World Food Programme.\r\nIn that connection, as indicated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in document A/50/706, the twenty-eighth session\r\nof the Conference of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) adopted on\r\nTuesday, 31 October 1995, by consensus, a resolution\r\nparallel to the draft resolution now before the Assembly.\r\nIn that resolution, the FAO Conference decided, subject\r\nto the concurrence of the Assembly, that the Committee\r\non Food Aid Policies and Programmes should be\r\nreconstituted as the Executive Board of the World Food\r\nProgramme.\r\nIf there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\ndecides not to discuss the report of the Second Committee\r\nwhich is before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the recommendation\r\nof the Second Committee have been made clear in the\r\nCommittee and are reflected in the relevant official records.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the recommendation\r\ncontained in the report of the Second Committee, I should\r\nlike to advise representatives that we are going to proceed\r\nto take a decision in the same manner as was done in the\r\nCommittee.\r\nThe Assembly has before it a draft resolution which is\r\ncontained in paragraph 5 of Part I of the report of the\r\nSecond Committee (A/50/615). The draft resolution is\r\nentitled “Revision of the General Regulations of the World\r\nFood Programme and reconstitution of the Committee on\r\nFood Aid Policies and Programmes as the Executive Board\r\nof the World Food Programme”.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\nresolution recommended for adoption by the Second\r\nCommittee in paragraph 5 of its report. May I take it that\r\nthe Assembly wishes to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 50/8).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded the present stage\r\nof its consideration of agenda item 12.\r\nAgenda item 133\r\nFinancing of the United Nations Mission in Haiti: report\r\nof the Fifth Committee (A/50/705)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): If\r\nthere is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure,\r\nI shall take it that the Assembly decides not to discuss the\r\nreport of the Fifth Committee that is before the Assembly\r\ntoday.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendation of the Fifth Committee have been made\r\nclear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant\r\nofficial records.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take a decision in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\ndecision recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 5 of its report (A/50/705). The draft decision\r\nwas adopted by the Fifth Committee without a vote.\r\nMay I consider that the Assembly too wishes to\r\nadopt the draft decision?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nagenda item 133.\r\nAgenda item 14\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the Agency (A/50/360)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.11)\r\nAmendment (A/50/L.12)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nBefore calling on the first speaker, I should like to\r\npropose that the list of speakers in the debate on this item\r\nbe closed today at noon.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees to this proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI therefore request representatives wishing to participate\r\nin the debate to place their names on the list of speakers\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nI now invite the Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency, Mr. Hans Blix, to present the\r\nreport of the Agency for the year 1994.\r\nMr. Blix (Director General, International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA)): On the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations it might be appropriate\r\nto review some of the main achievements and challenges\r\nfacing the international community in the field of\r\ncompetence of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), which was created to foster international\r\ncooperation in the field of the peaceful and safe use of\r\nnuclear energy.\r\nInternational efforts to promote the peaceful\r\napplication of nuclear energy and to prevent the further\r\nspread of nuclear weapons have resulted in the non-\r\nproliferation regime, with the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at its centre and\r\nwith the IAEA providing the function of verifying\r\ncompliance with non-proliferation pledges.\r\nIn May of this year the Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the NPT decided to extend the\r\nTreaty indefinitely. That decision underlined the broad and\r\nsolid commitment of the then 178 Parties to the Treaty. In\r\nmy view, the extension decision, and the Principles and\r\nObjectives and the strengthened review process that were\r\nalso adopted should be read as a collective commitment to\r\nthe exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy and to the\r\nrenunciation of nuclear weapons, a commitment by non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States not to acquire such weapons and a\r\ncommitment by the weapon States to nuclear disarmament\r\nwith the ultimate goal of eliminating these weapons.\r\nThe outcome of the NPT Conference has far-reaching\r\nimplications for the future work of the IAEA. The\r\nAgency’s role as a centre for international cooperation in\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy was confirmed, and the\r\nIAEA was expressly recognized as the competent authority\r\nresponsible for verifying compliance with safeguards\r\nagreements. The Conference called on Parties to the NPT\r\nwith concerns regarding non-compliance with safeguards\r\nagreements to direct such concerns, along with supporting\r\nevidence and information, to the IAEA for it to consider,\r\ninvestigate, draw conclusions and decide on necessary\r\nactions in accordance with its mandate. The Conference\r\nfurther called for support for the Agency’s efforts to\r\nstrengthen safeguards and to develop its capability to detect\r\npossible undeclared nuclear activities. I take this as a sign\r\nof trust in the Agency’s existing role in the field of\r\nverification.\r\nThe Conference also expressed its support for an\r\nexpanded the IAEA role in verification. It recommended\r\nthat nuclear material released from military use should be\r\nplaced under the IAEA safeguards as soon as practicable\r\nand that safeguards should be universally applied once the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons has been completed.\r\nThe NPT Conference called for the early conclusion\r\nof an agreement to end the production of nuclear material\r\nfor weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and\r\nendorsed the creation of additional nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones. It also set 1996 as the target date for the\r\ncompletion of a nuclear test ban, universally recognized\r\nas a vital component of the non-proliferation regime and\r\nan important step towards nuclear disarmament. There is\r\nan emerging consensus that the IAEA safeguards would\r\nbe an essential element on the verification of a cut-off\r\nagreement. It is also be expected, if the existing nuclear-\r\nweapon-free-zone agreements are an indication, that the\r\nAgency would have a verification role in any future\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nWith regard to a comprehensive test ban, it is\r\nrelevant to note that such a ban — verified by the\r\nIAEA — is already in force for the more than 170 non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States that have accepted comprehensive\r\nIAEA safeguards on all their nuclear activities. These\r\nStates are obliged not to use any nuclear material for\r\nexplosions, and the IAEA safeguards are required to\r\nverify that this obligation is respected. What role the\r\nAgency might be asked to assume under a comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty is still a matter of discussion at the\r\nConference on Disarmament at Geneva. Entrusting the\r\nIAEA with the function of verifying a comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty would undoubtedly save resources, which\r\nwould seem natural at a time when efforts are urged to\r\navoid duplication, overlap and unnecessary cost in the\r\nUnited Nations family. It would also permit more rapid\r\nimplementation.\r\nCredible IAEA verification of States’ compliance\r\nwith their nuclear-arms-control pledges is becoming an\r\nincreasingly important factor in global security and\r\nnuclear disarmament. The lessons of Iraq and the\r\nincreasing demands placed on the IAEA safeguards have\r\nnecessitated the strengthening of the safeguards system\r\nand making it more cost-effective. In particular,\r\nGovernments and the public now demand that the IAEA\r\nsafeguards system should have the capacity to detect any\r\nsecret, undeclared nuclear material and installations. There\r\nis also a greater understanding and readiness to accept\r\nthat such verification must include no-notice inspections,\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\ngreater freedom of movement for the inspectors and use of\r\nthe most modern means of detection and communication.\r\nThe Agency’s efforts to develop a strengthened\r\nsafeguards system have focused on three essential elements:\r\nfirst, increased access to information about a State’s nuclear\r\nactivities; secondly, broader access to sites and locations\r\nwithin a State; and, thirdly, maximum use of new and\r\navailable technologies to increase detection capacity and, in\r\ndue course, to reduce the frequency of on-site inspections.\r\nI am pleased to note that the Agency’s Board of Governors\r\nhas already accepted the first part of the Agency\r\nprogramme to strengthen its safeguards system, the so-\r\ncalled Programme “93 + 2”. The secretariat is in a position\r\nto implement these new measures after the required\r\nconsultation with Member States. The second part of the\r\nprogramme, which relates to measures requiring additional\r\nlegal authority, is due for consideration by the Agency’s\r\nBoard of Governors within a few months. The test of any\r\nnew measure is that it enhances the effectiveness of the\r\nsystem and is cost-effective. Experience gained in field\r\ntrials of some of the new measures suggests that they can\r\nbe implemented without much additional intrusion or cost\r\nto States.\r\nOn the other hand, a significant increase in the IAEA\r\nverification efforts in terms of cost and resources may\r\nresult if nuclear material released from the military\r\nprogrammes of nuclear-weapon States is placed under the\r\nIAEA safeguards, as urged by the 1995 Review and\r\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Verification\r\nof some such material released from the weapons\r\nprogramme of the United States was started a year ago.\r\nThese expanded efforts would require new arrangements to\r\nensure that the released material would permanently remain\r\nunder safeguards and that the financing of such verification\r\nwas assured.\r\nLast year I reported that the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea (DPRK) was not in full compliance with\r\nits safeguards agreement pursuant to the NPT. This\r\ncontinues to be the case. In the framework that was agreed\r\nbetween the DPRK and the United States on 21 October\r\n1994, the DPRK agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle\r\nits graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities and\r\nstated its intention eventually to come into full compliance\r\nwith the safeguards agreement. As the Assembly is aware,\r\nthe Security Council, confirming that the DPRK safeguards\r\nagreement remains in force and binding, requested the\r\nAgency to take the necessary steps to monitor the freeze.\r\nWith the authorization of the Board, we have been doing\r\nthis, inter alia, through the maintenance of a continuous\r\npresence of Agency inspectors in the DPRK. I can\r\nconfirm that the freeze has been put into effect and has\r\nbeen maintained to date. For the DPRK to come into full\r\ncompliance with the safeguards agreement, however, it\r\nmust enable the Agency to verify effectively the accuracy\r\nand completeness of its declaration of nuclear material\r\nsubject to safeguards. Until this cooperation — long\r\noverdue — comes about, it is essential that all necessary\r\nsteps be taken to preserve information that may be\r\nrelevant to the eventual verification of the DPRK’s initial\r\ndeclaration.\r\nTechnical meetings have been held with the DPRK\r\non a number of occasions to discuss activities that are\r\nrequired by the Agency for it to fulfil its obligations\r\nunder the safeguards agreement, including monitoring the\r\nfreeze. Since the first of these discussions in November\r\nlast year, arrangements have been made which enable the\r\nAgency to meet many of its obligations. However, a\r\nnumber of issues remain to be resolved, including the\r\nmeasures required for the preservation of information.\r\nLet me now turn to Iraq. As I reported to the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year, it is our conclusion that the\r\nessential components of Iraq’s clandestine nuclear-weapon\r\nprogramme have been identified and destroyed, removed\r\nor rendered harmless. This assessment was based not on\r\nfaith in Iraqi statements but on data gathered during\r\ninspection, on information provided by the suppliers and\r\nMember States and, to a great extent, on analysis of the\r\nlarge number of original documents which were obtained\r\nin Iraq early in the inspection process. Since August 1994\r\nthe IAEA inspectors have been continuously present in\r\nIraq to carry out ongoing monitoring and verification of\r\nIraq’s compliance with the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. This does not exclude the further conduct of\r\ninspections for the purpose of investigation, should such\r\nan investigation be called for, for example to verify new\r\ninformation.\r\nRecently, the IAEA received additional information\r\non Iraq’s former nuclear-weapons programme by way of\r\nnew declarations, voluminous documents and other\r\nmaterials which were transmitted to the IAEA and the\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) by Iraq\r\nfollowing the departure of the former Iraqi Minister of\r\nIndustry and Military Industrialization. What we have\r\nbeen told is that in 1990 Iraqi authorities instituted a\r\ncrash project to take safeguarded highly enriched research\r\nreactor fuel and transform the fissile material for use in\r\na nuclear weapon. It is uncertain whether Iraq would have\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nbeen able to overcome the considerable technical difficulties\r\ninvolved in this project. As it was, the project was made\r\nimpossible by damage inflicted on the nuclear research\r\ncentre at Tuwaitha by the January 1991 bombing, and the\r\nsafeguarded nuclear fuel was fully accounted for in the\r\nIAEA post-war inspection. The new Iraqi declarations,\r\nalong with all the documents and materials to which I have\r\nreferred, are currently being carefully examined for any\r\nnew data. What can be concluded at this stage is that Iraq’s\r\nwithholding of information, documents and materials clearly\r\nconstitutes a breach of Iraqi obligations under Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and that the crash programme was in\r\nviolation of the safeguards agreement and the NPT.\r\nAs requested last year by the Agency’s General\r\nConference, the Agency has continued to assist the African\r\nStates in their effort to establish an African\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone and in particular to help elaborate\r\nits verification regime. A draft treaty text which, inter alia,\r\nentrusts the Agency with the task of verification was\r\nadopted by the African Heads of State in Addis Ababa last\r\nJune and is now before the General Assembly. We look\r\nforward to performing the verification role in an African\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nThe General Conference of the IAEA continues to call\r\nupon all parties directly concerned in the Middle East to\r\nconsider taking the practical and appropriate steps required\r\nto establish a mutually and effectively verifiable\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East region This\r\nyear’s resolution again requested the Director General to\r\ncontinue consultations with the States of the Middle East to\r\nfacilitate the early application of full-scope Agency\r\nsafeguards to all nuclear activities in the region and the\r\npreparation of model verification agreements as a step\r\ntoward the establishment of such a zone. I intend to\r\ncontinue my visits to and consultations with States in the\r\nregion in order further to explore the verification questions\r\nand the material obligations which may be agreed upon and\r\nwhich may call for verification.\r\nFor the last two years the international community has\r\nbeen expressing alarm at the number of incidents of illicit\r\ntrafficking in nuclear materials as well as other radioactive\r\nsources. Although the reported cases in 1995 show a\r\ndecreasing trend, this is no cause for complacency. It is\r\nclear that greater efforts are needed and that States must\r\npay increased attention to the physical protection of all\r\nradioactive material — and especially weapons-useable\r\nnuclear material — whether in use, transport or storage.\r\nWhile the primary responsibility in the field of illegal\r\ntrafficking falls upon the State concerned, authorities in\r\nmany countries, as well as a number of international\r\norganizations, are seeking to strengthen and coordinate\r\ntheir efforts to better protect and control radioactive\r\nmaterials. The IAEA has recently hosted a large\r\ninter-agency meeting for that purpose.\r\nWithin the IAEA, a plan of action has been put in\r\nplace. The Agency is establishing a data base of\r\ntrafficking incidents to provide factual information to\r\nMember States’ Governments and to the public. Further,\r\nas effective national accounting and protection is the basic\r\nprerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling\r\ninto unauthorized hands, the Agency is conducting\r\ntraining courses in the implementation of State systems of\r\naccounting and control of nuclear material and in physical\r\nprotection methods and technology. With the assistance of\r\nmany donor countries, the Agency has also coordinated\r\ntechnical support efforts in the upgrading of physical\r\nprotection of nuclear material in the newly independent\r\nStates of the former Soviet Union.\r\nSince the Chernobyl accident, the Agency’s role in\r\nthe field of nuclear safety has been gradually expanding.\r\nIn addition to the sharing of information and the\r\ndevelopment of safety guidelines and standards, the\r\nAgency has moved progressively in the field of providing\r\nadvisory services to member States, such as the\r\nOperational Safety Advisory Review Teams, which\r\nprovide expert services in assessing and advising on\r\noperational safety of power reactors, and the Analysis of\r\nSafety-Significant Events Teams. Agency work on\r\nassessment of the safety of nuclear power plants in\r\nEastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union\r\nhas continued; an international consensus now exists on\r\nthe major safety issues and their significance for each of\r\nthe various reactor types. The emphasis is now shifting to\r\na review of the status of implementation of the proposed\r\nsafety improvements and to the collection of up-to-date\r\ninformation on the upgrading situation at each of the\r\nreactors involved. The results of our work provide input\r\ninto bilateral and multilateral assistance projects\r\ncoordinated by the G-24 mechanisms in Brussels.\r\nThe decision to operate — or not to operate — a\r\nreactor is a national prerogative. The IAEA has not been\r\ngiven any supranational competence in this regard.\r\nHowever, the Agency continues to provide, upon request,\r\nexpert advice on the safety of reactors and on safety\r\nimprovements needed. On some occasions the Agency has\r\nadvised that it would be imprudent for a particular reactor\r\nto operate unless safety improvements were ensured.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nNo nuclear accident has been the subject of more\r\nanalysis, as regards both its causes and its consequences,\r\nthan the one at Chernobyl. Even so — or perhaps precisely\r\nfor this reason — the accounts and explanations vary\r\nconsiderably, especially as to the radiological impact of the\r\naccident on the health of the affected people and the\r\nenvironment. It is evidently desirable that this impact be\r\nscientifically established, as is the radiological impact of the\r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombs. On the occasion of\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the tragic accident at the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant, in April 1996, the Agency, and several\r\nother organizations — for instance, the World Health\r\nOrganization and the European Union — are organizing in\r\nApril next year an international conference to seek a\r\ncommon understanding of the nature and magnitude of the\r\nconsequences of that accident. Let me add, however, that\r\nwhile such understanding is highly desirable, there is no\r\nreason for anybody to delay action and assistance to\r\nalleviate the situation of the people concerned. Many\r\nenquiries following the Chernobyl accident have\r\ndocumented the distressing situation in which they live.\r\nIn the field of nuclear power safety, the IAEA has\r\nlong issued recommendations based on best experience and\r\npractice. More recently the Agency has also moved to\r\ndevelop binding international safety standards. This is a\r\nclear manifestation of the increased interest of the\r\ninternational community that nuclear safety be at a high\r\nlevel everywhere. There is a growing realization that an\r\naccident anywhere is an accident everywhere. A major\r\naccomplishment was the adoption in June last year of the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety. So far the Convention has\r\nbeen signed by 59 States. It may be expected to enter into\r\nforce next year. This month representatives of signatories\r\nof the Convention and other interested States will hold their\r\nsecond meeting to discuss matters relating to the\r\nimplementation process.\r\nStill in the field of nuclear safety and security, let me\r\nnote that these subjects will be taken up at a summit\r\nmeeting to be hosted in Russia next spring. It is to be\r\nhoped that the summit will give political impetus to work\r\nin the field of nuclear safety and security, thereby reducing\r\nrisks and making nuclear power more broadly acceptable to\r\nthe public.\r\nNuclear waste disposal remains a major concern\r\namong the public in many countries. This concern might\r\nlessen when Governments and industry have actually\r\nestablished repositories for wastes of different levels of\r\nradioactivity. From the scientific and technical standpoint\r\nthere are no serious obstacles to the building of repositories\r\nwhich remain safe for extremely long periods of time.\r\nThe selection of disposal sites, however, often meets with\r\nopposition. We can only place our faith in the effect of\r\nrational argument. An open dialogue with the public is\r\nrequired. The IAEA continues to be active in the field of\r\nradioactive waste management, including providing\r\nassistance to developing States in building up\r\ninfrastructures for waste management, and promoting the\r\nminimization, safe processing, storage and disposal of\r\nradioactive wastes. I am pleased to report that work has\r\nalready started on the preparation of a convention on the\r\nsafe management of radioactive waste, providing binding\r\nstandards. Significant progress has been made, and it is to\r\nbe hoped that a final draft could perhaps be ready some\r\ntime next year.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the\r\ninternational community is to find the proper means of\r\nproviding sufficient energy for sustainable\r\ndevelopment — that is to say providing energy without\r\nunacceptable damage to the environment. Experts have\r\nconcluded that goals to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions\r\nat 1990 levels are not attainable by the year 2000 under\r\npresent conditions. In national action reports prepared by\r\nparties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change\r\nmany countries report that they will not achieve the goals\r\nthat they have set for themselves, goals that they have\r\nalready agreed are not adequate for the long term. Indeed,\r\nlooking around the world we can easily see how the need\r\nfor development and the correlated need for greater\r\nenergy use is leading to the construction of ever more\r\ninstallations burning coal, oil and gas. Extensive analysis\r\nof energy options is clearly needed if we are to resolve\r\nthe dilemma between development and preservation of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nIt is not very meaningful to analyse the economic\r\nand ecological aspects of any given energy option in\r\nisolation. All sources and uses of energy have their\r\nrisks — as, indeed, an absence of energy carries risks.\r\nOnly an analysis of different options side by side can tell\r\nus which energy policy is economically and ecologically\r\nleast burdensome. The IAEA is cooperating with several\r\ninternational organizations in drawing up methodologies\r\nand data bases for comparative assessment of different\r\noptions for the production of electric power. An\r\ninternational symposium addressed this issue in Vienna\r\nlast month. This is an area where difficult policy\r\ndecisions must be taken. Governments need to devise\r\nlong-term energy policies that are economically and\r\necologically acceptable. Solar power, wind power,\r\nbiomass and other renewables will bring a valuable but\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nminor contribution to the global energy supply within the\r\nnext few decades. There is scope for more efficient energy\r\nuse, and it should be promoted. However, in most places it\r\nwill not offset the need for additional energy and it is\r\nevident that developing countries will need energy in much\r\ngreater amounts. There are no new energy sources on the\r\nhorizon that can magically meet these needs. Fusion is still\r\nvery distant.\r\nExpansion of nuclear power, which now provides\r\nabout 8 per cent of the world’s energy and 17 per cent of\r\nits electricity, could provide a part of the solution on the\r\nsupply side without increasing emissions of carbon dioxide,\r\nsulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxides. The main obstacle to\r\nincreased use of nuclear energy is public concern with\r\nsafety, radioactive waste and non-proliferation. Any\r\nparticular energy mix chosen has to be based on\r\ncomparative risk assessment of the various sources of\r\nenergy and will need to be thoroughly explained to the\r\npublic. The IAEA, for its part, will continue to make\r\navailable the data that are relevant in this regard, and\r\nfactual information relevant to nuclear safety, radioactive\r\nwaste management and non-proliferation.\r\nFew developing countries have a technological level\r\nand infrastructure that would allow them to make use of the\r\npresent type of nuclear power reactors. It is to be hoped\r\nthat, in the future, smaller and less costly nuclear reactors\r\nwill become available for use by developing countries for\r\nthe generation of electricity and perhaps also in the\r\ndesalination of water to compensate for scarce fresh water\r\nresources. Developing countries members of the IAEA are\r\nkeenly interested in these questions. It is obvious that the\r\nrapidly increasing number of cities with more than a\r\nmillion, even more than 10 million, inhabitants in\r\ndeveloping countries cannot be provided with electricity\r\ngenerated by, say, solar cells, windmills or biomass. Their\r\nreal choice for decades to come will be between fossil fuels\r\nand nuclear power.\r\nAt present, only a few developing countries use\r\nnuclear power. However, most of them are intensely\r\ninterested in non-power nuclear techniques that may help\r\ntheir development, and the IAEA is engaged in assisting the\r\ntransfer of such techniques. Emphasis is being placed on\r\ntechniques that will contribute to sustainable development,\r\nfood production and preservation, the harnessing of\r\nfreshwater resources, industrial uses and the promotion of\r\nhuman health. The Agency has recently undertaken several\r\ninitiatives to strengthen its technical cooperation programme\r\nand to make it more effective and more relevant to\r\nsustainable development. Working together with member\r\nStates, the secretariat has started preparing country\r\nprogramme frameworks which will help to focus the\r\ntechnical cooperation programmes on key areas of\r\nGovernment priority, with fewer but better-focused\r\nprojects. Another measure planned is the promotion of\r\ntechnical cooperation among developing countries, with\r\nthe aim of subcontracting institutions in developing\r\ncountries recognized as centres of excellence in a\r\nparticular field to implement selected technical\r\ncooperation projects.\r\nAt the Review and Extension Conference of the\r\nStates Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, all participants acknowledged the\r\nimportance of the work of the Agency as the principal\r\ninstrument for the transfer of nuclear technology to\r\ndeveloping countries, and welcomed the successful\r\noperation of the Agency’s technical assistance and\r\ncooperation programmes. It was also recognized that the\r\nsuccess of these programmes depends on the availability\r\nof predictable resources. I sincerely hope that the States\r\nmembers of the Agency will pay their contributions to the\r\nTechnical Assistance and Cooperation Fund in full and in\r\ntime to enable the Agency to continue to perform its\r\ndevelopment mission successfully.\r\nDuring this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nI cannot close my statement to the General Assembly\r\nwithout some comments on coordination within the\r\nUnited Nations family of organizations and on\r\neffectiveness and efficiency. In both respects, severe\r\ncriticism has been voiced.\r\nThat coordination is difficult in a vast system of\r\norganizations, authorities and administrations is no\r\nnovelty to national Governments, many of which have\r\nexperience of similar problems, though they have the\r\nadvantage of a central Government and a legislature.\r\nWithin the United Nations family, action by the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination, and under informal contacts and\r\narrangements, can help to harmonize activities and\r\nprevent some overlap. The most important contacts\r\nbetween the IAEA and the United Nations occur in cases\r\nof non-compliance with safeguards agreements. The cases\r\nof Iraq and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nhave given us much experience in cooperation.\r\nThe Administrative Committee on Coordination,\r\nunder the chairmanship of the Secretary-General, is\r\nincreasingly — and, I think, with some success — trying\r\nto ensure effective system-wide responses in matters such\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nas sustainable development, African development and the\r\nrole of women, that are relevant in all or most\r\norganizations. The technique, recently employed, of\r\nindicating lead agencies for certain questions may prove\r\nhelpful.\r\nEffective action by organizations in the United Nations\r\nfamily is in many cases directly dependent on the degree of\r\ncooperation that can be achieved between Member States.\r\nHowever, there is also much action that is undertaken\r\nmainly by the secretariats. Here, effectiveness depends\r\nlargely upon the same factors as those which influence\r\nefficiency: the availability of adequate and predictable\r\nresources, the cooperation of States that may be affected,\r\nand — last but not least — the competence and skill of\r\nmanagement and staff in the secretariats. We stand or fall\r\non the quality of our management and staff. This is true of\r\nthe IAEA and, I am sure, of the other organizations in the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nThe Agency has some unique features, which continue\r\nto serve us well in staffing, but which may also deter some\r\nqualified experts from joining us. Professional staff in the\r\nIAEA are not recruited for a career, but for a period of five\r\nto seven years. This policy of rotation has been followed to\r\nensure a continuous influx of talents fresh from\r\nlaboratories, nuclear installations and other institutions —\r\ntalents abreast of the latest developments in their field. To\r\nhave the respect and cooperation of the experts with whom\r\nour staff interact in member States, our professional staff\r\nmust be on a par with the national experts.\r\nI am not suggesting that there is a direct correlation\r\nbetween remuneration and work delivery. However, there\r\nis not the slightest doubt that when the pros and cons of\r\nemployment in an international organization are being\r\nweighed, remuneration, home leave, education grants for\r\nchildren, pension benefits, and so on, have a very\r\nsignificant impact on potential candidates and, hence, on\r\nour ability to recruit staff of the highest calibre.\r\nIn this regard, the IAEA and other organizations are\r\ndependent upon the so-called United Nations common\r\nsystem of remuneration, to which we have adhered. This\r\nsystem, as it now stands, falls short on several counts. Let\r\nme give the Assembly just a few illustrations. We have\r\ngeneral service staff who turn down offers of posts at the\r\nprofessional level because acceptance would lower their\r\nsalary. Since 1984, professional remuneration in Vienna has\r\nlost about 20 per cent of its purchasing power. A senior\r\nenergy economist who goes from the Agency to the World\r\nBank may expect a salary 40 per cent higher; a safeguards\r\ninspector who leaves the Agency, in Vienna, for the\r\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community, in Luxembourg,\r\nmay expect his income to increase by at least a third. We\r\ndo not know how many candidates refrain from applying\r\nfor a job in the Agency because they are offered better\r\nconditions elsewhere, but we know that only 4 to 6 per\r\ncent of those who currently apply for jobs with us meet\r\nour exacting recruitment standards.\r\nAs Director General of the IAEA, I joined other\r\nexecutive heads in issuing a statement, recently adopted\r\nby the Administrative Committee on Coordination, which,\r\ninter alia, endorses the salary increases recommended by\r\nthe International Civil Service Commission. These would\r\nbring United Nations remuneration into the middle of the\r\nmargin range approved by the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, such a step — in itself urgently needed —\r\nwould subsequently have to be supplemented by a longer-\r\nterm strategy of restoring competitiveness.\r\nAn improvement in the remuneration system is not\r\na panacea for all the management problems that United\r\nNations organizations face. It might even look to some an\r\nodd response to a critical financial situation and to sharp\r\ncriticism for waste and inefficiency. I would submit,\r\nhowever, that the remuneration system is part of the\r\npresent problem. Unless management is given the ability\r\nand freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest\r\ncalibre, from anywhere in the world — and this can be\r\ndone only if remuneration is internationally competitive\r\nand if Governments refrain from interfering in a fair\r\nselection process — it will be hard, if not impossible, to\r\nachieve the continuous improvement in quality and\r\nefficiency that is rightly called for in the secretariats of\r\nUnited Nations organizations.\r\nI am sorry to bring these mundane matters before\r\ndelegations, but this body — the General Assembly —\r\nnot only lays down political guidance for us in Vienna\r\nbut also decides on employment and other conditions that\r\ndirectly affect our ability and that of other international\r\norganizations to fulfil the mandates they have been given.\r\nLet me end on a positive note by telling the\r\nAssembly that Vienna, although in some respects an\r\nexpensive city, is an excellent work station, and the\r\nAustrian Government and the city of Vienna the\r\nfriendliest of hosts.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative\r\nof the Netherlands to introduce draft resolution A/50/L.11.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nMr. Dumoré (Netherlands): It is my honour and\r\npleasure to present draft resolution A/50/L.11, on the report\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency, on behalf of\r\nArgentina, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, the\r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece,\r\nGuatemala, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, the\r\nMarshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the\r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland,\r\nPortugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine,\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nand the United States of America.\r\nThe traditional General Assembly resolution on the\r\nannual report of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) is about the Agency’s recent and prospective\r\nactivities and is meant to endorse these important activities\r\nas well as to comment on them. In this introduction, I will\r\nonly point out the few changes from General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/65 that have been incorporated into this new\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nThe third preambular paragraph is a new paragraph\r\nthat has been lifted in toto from the NPT Principles and\r\nObjectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament\r\nin order to introduce more consensus language with regard\r\nto safeguards into the text.\r\nThe ninth preambular paragraph and operative\r\nparagraph 7 have been inserted into the text to bring it into\r\nline with the consensus language stemming from the\r\nGeneral Conference of the Agency in Vienna.\r\nThe tenth preambular paragraph and operative\r\nparagraph 6 also represent an update of the resolution based\r\non developments and General Conference resolutions in\r\nVienna.\r\nThe twelfth preambular paragraph takes account of\r\nGC(39)/RES/20 and deals with women in the secretariat;\r\nthis is an addition inspired by the recent Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing.\r\nIt is important that the resolution on the Agency’s\r\nannual report attract wide support. All Agency member\r\nStates have common interests in ensuring that the work of\r\nthe Agency in all areas — including safeguards, technical\r\nassistance, radiation safety, and so on — receives due\r\nrecognition. The cosponsors of draft resolution A/50/L.11\r\nbelieve that this annual resolution is particularly helpful for\r\nthe important work performed by the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency in all fields, and recommend that it be\r\nadopted with the broadest possible support in its original,\r\nunamended form.\r\nMr. Laclaustra (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,\r\nRomania and the Slovak Republic associate themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express our gratitude for the\r\nwork carried out by the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) in 1994 and to date in 1995, as described\r\nin its annual report for 1994 and in the additional\r\ninformation just provided by the Director General of the\r\nIAEA. We commend the Director General and the\r\nsecretariat of the Agency for their efforts, which have\r\nmade possible an expanded programme despite limited\r\nresources.\r\nThe European Union is aware of the importance of\r\nthe various elements that make up the programme of\r\nwork of the IAEA in accordance with its statutory\r\nfunctions, in particular in the field of non-proliferation,\r\nthe promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and\r\nthe strengthening of the international cooperation on\r\nnuclear safety, radiological protection and waste\r\nmanagement. The European Union wishes to make a few\r\nspecific comments on these areas and on the general\r\nmanagement of the IAEA.\r\nStarting with non-proliferation, we should like first\r\nto recall the many achievements of the international\r\ncommunity in this field during this period, which are a\r\nsource of great satisfaction for the European Union.\r\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has\r\nunquestionably been a decisive landmark on the path\r\ntowards the attainment of a stable legal framework to\r\nstem the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The decision\r\non principles and objectives, also adopted by the Review\r\nand Extension Conference of the Parties to the NPT,\r\ndeserves special attention because it refers specifically to\r\nthe IAEA, and in particular to the safeguards regime and\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy. The principles\r\nrecognize that the IAEA is the competent authority\r\nresponsible for verifying and ensuring compliance with its\r\nsafeguards agreements with States parties, with a view to\r\npreventing the diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful\r\nuses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\ndevices. The principles also state that the Agency’s\r\ncapability to detect undeclared nuclear activities should be\r\nincreased and that every effort should be made to ensure\r\nthat the Agency has the financial and human resources\r\nnecessary to meet effectively its responsibilities in the areas\r\nof technical cooperation, safeguards and nuclear safety.\r\nGreat progress has also been achieved on the path to\r\ngreater universality of the NPT. The European Union\r\nwelcomes the accession of Ukraine to the NPT as a\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon State, as well as the accessions of 12\r\nother States. Nevertheless, a small number of States\r\ncontinue to remain outside the fundamental norms that\r\ngovern nuclear non-proliferation. I therefore appeal once\r\nagain, on behalf of the European Union, to all these\r\nStates — in particular those that operate unsafeguarded\r\nnuclear facilities — to accede to the Treaty.\r\nAlthough considerable progress has been made in the\r\nprevention of nuclear proliferation, important challenges\r\nmust still be faced in the near future, such as the conclusion\r\nno later than 1996 of an internationally and effectively\r\nverifiable zero-yield comprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nThe conclusion of a treaty on a the prohibition of the\r\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other\r\nnuclear explosive devices — the so-called cut-off treaty —\r\nis another European Union priority in the field of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. We also support the\r\ncreation of new, internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones, in accordance with the aforementioned\r\nprinciples and objectives approved by the NPT Review and\r\nExtension Conference.\r\nAs regards the IAEA safeguards, the European Union\r\nconsiders that strengthening the system by means of\r\nmeasures derived from the “93+2” Programme is a key\r\npriority. The Union expresses its satisfaction with the\r\nprogress achieved in this field, in particular with the fact\r\nthat the Board of Governors, at its meeting last June, urged\r\nStates parties to comprehensive safeguards agreements to\r\ncooperate in the implementation of measures that constitute\r\nthe first phase of the Programme. The European Union\r\nhopes for the timely implementation of these measures and\r\nwill cooperate to that end.\r\nAs to the group of measures that constitute the second\r\nphase of the Programme, their broad outlines were endorsed\r\nlast March by the Board of Governors. The European\r\nUnion is prepared to engage in further consultations with\r\nthe secretariat of the IAEA on the measures to be taken in\r\nthis phase, and is looking forward to cooperating in\r\ncarrying out such consultations. The European Union\r\nhopes that, as a result of this process of consultation,\r\nconcrete proposals on measures for States with\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements will be presented\r\nto the Board of Governors of the IAEA.\r\nRegarding the implementation of safeguards in 1994,\r\nthe European Union supports the conclusions reached by\r\nthe Director General of the IAEA. Concerning Iraq, the\r\nEuropean Union notes with satisfaction the results\r\nattained in dismantling its clandestine nuclear programme\r\nas well as in implementing the permanent Plan for control\r\nand verification of compliance with resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council. Nevertheless, long-term success can be\r\nensured only if Iraq continues to cooperate fully with the\r\nIAEA.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the advances made\r\nin the implementation of the Agreed Framework between\r\nthe United States and the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea (DPRK). However, the European Union regrets\r\nthat the DPRK still does not consider itself fully bound\r\nby its safeguards agreement with the IAEA and is not\r\ncomplying with its legal obligations under that agreement.\r\nThis remains a matter of grave concern. In this respect,\r\nwe welcome the resolution adopted by the last General\r\nConference of the IAEA.\r\nThe potential for illicit trafficking in nuclear\r\nmaterials continues to give cause for general concern. The\r\nUnion has actively participated in defining an\r\ninternational strategy to tackle this problem, within the\r\nIAEA framework. The existence of effective national\r\naccountancy and control systems, especially in those\r\ncountries possessing sensitive nuclear material, and the\r\nexistence of systems to ensure physical protection are\r\ncrucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking.\r\nTurning now to the activities of the Agency in the\r\nfield of nuclear safety and radiological protection, the\r\nEuropean Union would like first to express its satisfaction\r\nat the adoption and signature in 1994 of the Convention\r\non Nuclear Safety, and its hope that the Convention will\r\nsoon enter into force.\r\nThe European Union also welcomes the progress\r\nachieved in the safe management of radioactive waste,\r\nwhich has paved the way for the drafting of a convention\r\non the safety of radioactive waste management.\r\nAmong the many important activities carried out by\r\nthe IAEA in the area of nuclear safety and radiological\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nprotection, one is of special interest to the European Union:\r\nthe extrabudgetary programme for the safety of WWER and\r\nRMBK type reactors, to which the European Union makes\r\na large financial contribution. The European Union provides\r\nfirm support also for ensuring greater safety for these\r\nreactors, as is proved by its many contributions both\r\nbilaterally and through the PHARE and TACIS\r\nProgrammes.\r\nThe broad range of contributions which the European\r\nUnion makes every year to the IAEA technical cooperation\r\nprogramme is visible proof of the great importance it\r\nattaches to this matter.\r\nA review of the information on the technical-\r\ncooperation activities for 1994 makes clear the magnitude\r\nof the work undertaken by the Secretariat of the Agency,\r\nwhich deserves praise, especially if one bears in mind the\r\nfact that it has had to develop its activities in the context of\r\nlimited resources. Even so, this has not prevented a large\r\nincrease in the technical assistance provided, as expressed\r\nin new net obligations. On the other hand, in the current\r\nresource situation it is even more important for the IAEA\r\nto continue to focus on ensuring that available resources are\r\nused effectively.\r\nLooking now to future activities of the Agency, the\r\nEuropean Union is of the opinion that a greater effort is\r\nneeded to set priorities and to introduce stringent evaluation\r\nmethods into all such activities. This will entail difficult\r\ndecisions in order to ensure that all ineffective or low-\r\npriority programmes are eliminated, which will facilitate the\r\nfinancing of new programmes that are really necessary.\r\nLooking further ahead, the time has come for the\r\nAgency to carry out the preparatory work needed to\r\ndetermine the directions and magnitude of its activities\r\nbeyond the year 2000. The major new factors in this\r\nexercise will be the need to fully implement Programme\r\n“93+2”, as well as the new responsibilities that could be\r\nassigned to the Agency in relation to future international\r\ntreaties, such as the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty\r\nand the so-called cut-off convention, on the prohibition of\r\nthe production of fissile materials for weapons purposes.\r\nThe European Union supports the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/50/L.11, just introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of the Netherlands, and hopes that the\r\nGeneral Assembly will also support it.\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan): I should like to thank the\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. Hans Blix, for his comprehensive\r\nand clear report to the Assembly.\r\nThis has been a special year in view of the decision\r\nthat was taken at the Review and Extension Conference\r\nof Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), here in New York last may to\r\nextend the NPT indefinitely. At the time, two documents\r\nwere also adopted — namely, “Strengthening the Review\r\nProcess for the Treaty” and “Principles and Objectives for\r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament”. Further, it\r\nwas reconfirmed that the IAEA has a very important role\r\nto play in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy\r\nand in verifying and assuring compliance with safeguards\r\nagreements.\r\nBefore I proceed to specific topics concerning the\r\nactivities of the IAEA during the past year, I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to briefly take up the issue of\r\nnuclear testing.\r\nThe NPT Conference set 1996 as a target date for\r\nthe conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and\r\nstated in its decision that\r\n“Pending entry into force of a comprehensive test-\r\nban treaty, the nuclear-weapon-States should\r\nexercise utmost restraint.” (NPT/CONF.1995/32\r\n(Part I), Decision 2, para. 4 (a))\r\nUnder these circumstances, the General Conference of the\r\nIAEA adopted without a vote a resolution which,\r\ninter alia, expressed grave concern at the resumption and\r\nthe continuation of nuclear testing. My delegation believes\r\nthat this resolution was a significant step in the process of\r\nconcluding a comprehensive test-ban treaty. In this\r\nconnection, I would like to note the suggestion that\r\nVienna be made the seat of the organization for that\r\ntreaty, inasmuch as the necessary expertise could be made\r\navailable by the IAEA in Vienna to support the\r\norganization. My delegation thinks that the location of the\r\ntreaty organization is a very important issue, and should\r\nbe carefully considered during the negotiations on the\r\ntreaty.\r\nWith regard to the suspected development of nuclear\r\nweapons by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\n(DPRK), Japan would like to reiterate that it welcomes\r\nthe Agreed Framework, concluded in October 1994,\r\nbetween the United States and North Korea. Japan will\r\ncontinue to exert its utmost efforts to resolve this issue\r\nthrough its participation in the Korean Peninsula Energy\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nDevelopment Organization (KEDO), which was established\r\nin March of this year. My Government has always\r\nsupported the Director General and his staff in their\r\nongoing and impartial efforts to implement the safeguards\r\nagreement between the IAEA and the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea (DPRK), including efforts to monitor the\r\nfreeze of specified facilities as requested by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe experiences of the IAEA in Iraq, as well as in\r\nNorth Korea, illustrate clearly the need to further strengthen\r\nthe safeguards system. It is particularly important that the\r\nAgency improve its ability to detect undeclared nuclear\r\ndevelopment activities. The Agency has responded actively\r\nto this requirement. Japan supports the direction of\r\nProgramme “93+2”, which seeks to formulate measures to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of\r\nthe safeguards system.\r\nThe adoption last year of the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety was truly an epochal development. Japan deposited\r\nits instrument of acceptance of the Convention in May of\r\nthis year, and hopes that many other States will likewise do\r\nso, in order that the Convention may enter into force\r\nwithout delay.\r\nThe safe management of radioactive waste is also\r\nimportant in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nJapan will make positive contributions to the Agency’s\r\nactivities in this area, including its deliberations on a\r\nconvention on the safety of radioactive waste management.\r\nI wish to note in this regard that the Agency has been\r\nactively involved in the improvement of nuclear safety and\r\nthe establishment of safeguards systems in countries of the\r\nformer Soviet Union. Recognizing the importance of these\r\nactivities of the Agency, Japan has contributed to them and\r\nbelieves they should be continued.\r\nJapan also attaches great importance to the multilateral\r\ntechnical cooperation activities of the Agency and has\r\nactively contributed both human and financial resources to\r\nsupport them. Japan will continue to provide assistance to\r\nthe best of its ability for the development and improvement\r\nof human resource skills in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy.\r\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize that the Agency’s\r\nachievements depend ultimately upon the firm support of\r\nmember States. We must all do our best to further develop\r\nthis important organization.\r\nMs. Tomová (Slovakia): At the outset I should like\r\nto say that we fully associate ourselves with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Spain on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and associated countries.\r\nThe Slovak Republic deems the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency to be a highly important international\r\norganization in the United Nations system. The IAEA\r\nplays an exceptionally significant role in verifying\r\nfulfilment of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and its safeguards system, as\r\nwell as in the promotion of international cooperation in\r\nthe peaceful uses of atomic energy.\r\nSlovakia considers that the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons fosters the development\r\nof the peaceful uses of nuclear energy by providing a\r\nframework of confidence within which those uses can\r\ntake place. The indefinite extension of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty promotes stability, confidence and\r\nfavourable conditions for the non-proliferation regime and\r\nnuclear disarmament.\r\nSlovakia has noted with satisfaction that the 1995\r\nReview and Extension Conference of the States Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nreaffirmed the IAEA safeguards system as a key element\r\nof the Treaty for preventing the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. The IAEA plays an irreplaceable role in the\r\nobservance of the provisions of the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty through the safeguards system, with the aim of\r\npreventing the conversion of fissile material from peaceful\r\nuses to military purposes and of strengthening mutual\r\nconfidence. During the recent period the safeguards\r\nsystem has justified itself. The IAEA safeguards provide\r\nan assurance that States are complying with their\r\nundertakings and assist them to demonstrate this\r\ncompliance. Such safeguards play a significant role in\r\npreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other\r\nexplosive devices.\r\nSlovakia strictly fulfils its obligations under its full-\r\nscope safeguards agreement with the IAEA. As far as\r\naccounting is concerned, the owners of nuclear materials\r\nare obliged to keep exact records of the amounts, imports,\r\nexports, storage sites, consumption and transport in terms\r\nof the requirements of the IAEA and the Slovak\r\nRepublic’s Nuclear Regulatory Authority.\r\nWe have supported the IAEA’s Programme “93+2”\r\non strengthening and improving the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of the safeguards system. The Programme\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nrepresents the utilization of modern, advanced verification\r\ntechniques for better confidence-building in future. With the\r\naim of implementing a more effective safeguards system,\r\nSlovakia supports the application of greater nuclear\r\ntransparency, environmental monitoring, the expanded right\r\nto prompt access to information and sites, and short notice\r\nor notice inspections. We call for closer cooperation with\r\nthe Agency. The case of Iraq is not the only case to\r\nhighlight the need for the Agency to strengthen safeguards.\r\nWith expanding nuclear disarmament and arms-control\r\nmeasures, all countries will demand highly credible\r\nverification in the nuclear field to provide assurances that\r\ndeclarations on nuclear material and installations are correct\r\nand complete and that nothing has been forgotten or hidden.\r\nRegarding the violation of commitments by Iraq, we\r\nstrongly urge the Iraqi authorities to cooperate fully in the\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions\r\nand the activities of the Agency’s Action Team. We also\r\nappeal to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to\r\ncooperate fully with the Agency in its monitoring and\r\nsafeguarding role.\r\nSlovakia considers that measures to strengthen the\r\nsafeguards system, effective and transparent multilateral\r\nexport control, and activities aimed at preventing illicit\r\ntrafficking in nuclear materials should be interconnected.\r\nWe welcome the IAEA’s efforts to help member States to\r\nmeet their responsibilities in regard to the control of nuclear\r\nmaterial. The IAEA safeguards should be an essential\r\nelement of the verification of a ban on the production of\r\nfissile material for nuclear explosive devices. We regret that\r\nprogress on a cut-off agreement appears to be slow.\r\nAn inseparable part of the nuclear non-proliferation\r\nand disarmament issue is the comprehensive test-ban treaty\r\n(CTBT). The CTBT should put in place a cost-effective and\r\nefficient international monitoring system that would have\r\nthe capability of identifying and measuring effects related\r\nto nuclear explosions in three environments through several\r\nnetworks based on different technologies. With the aim of\r\nachieving the above-mentioned goals, we endorse close\r\ncooperation between the CTBT-implementing organization\r\nand the IAEA and its co-location in Vienna. The Slovak\r\nRepublic supports the early drafting, conclusion and entry\r\ninto force of a CTBT banning all nuclear explosions once\r\nand for all, without any exception. We are pleased that\r\nnegotiations on the treaty are making progress.\r\nSlovakia welcomes the Agency’s efforts to strengthen\r\ntechnical cooperation activities in areas such as nuclear\r\nsafety, radiation protection, radioactive waste management,\r\nfood production and the development of groundwater\r\nresources. The establishment of the Standing Advisory\r\nGroup on Technical Assistance and Co-operation\r\n(SAGTAC) reflects a common desire to strengthen\r\ntechnical cooperation activities. We consider the concept\r\nof model projects to be a key element of the new\r\napproach. Model projects are the way to ensure that\r\nprogrammes meet the needs of end-users and conform to\r\nthe priorities of the recipient country. This new approach\r\nis significantly increasing the Agency’s contribution to\r\npeace, health and prosperity throughout the world. In\r\norder to achieve social and economic objectives, recipient\r\ncountries should also use a wider end-user approach to\r\nformulate project proposals. The elaboration of a medium-\r\nterm country plan and a country programme framework\r\nwill contribute to more effective technical assistance. We\r\nbelieve that the Agency will be provided with sufficient\r\nresources to implement its technical cooperation activities.\r\nWe urge member States to show their deep commitment\r\nto the technical cooperation programme by pledging their\r\nfull share of the Technical Assistance and Co-operation\r\nFund target.\r\nThe Slovak Republic takes a positive view of its\r\ncooperation with the IAEA in the peaceful uses of atomic\r\nenergy. It appreciates the contribution of several projects\r\nwhich are organized in collaboration with the IAEA for\r\nthe further development of Slovakia’s nuclear programme\r\nand for improvement of the nuclear safety and availability\r\nof our nuclear power plants. We welcome the significant\r\nincrease in the Agency’s technical cooperation with\r\nSlovakia over the past two years. A model project to\r\nstrengthen the nuclear safety regulatory body in Slovakia\r\nis proceeding very satisfactorily. We are prepared to\r\ncontribute to regional cooperation and to share our\r\nexperience through similar projects in other countries.\r\nCooperation with the IAEA, of which Slovakia is a\r\nmember of the Board of Governors, plays an important\r\nrole in international contacts for the Slovak Republic.\r\nTechnical assistance and cooperation, in particular, have\r\ndeveloped very successfully. There are at present 6\r\nnational and 11 regional projects under implementation in\r\nwhich Slovakia is taking an active part. It is also\r\nsuccessfully developing bilateral and multilateral\r\ncooperation with G-24 countries, as well as with other\r\ncountries.\r\nAs to preparatory work for a convention on the\r\nsafety of radioactive waste management, good progress\r\nhas been made, and a final draft could be ready within a\r\nshorter period than originally anticipated. This is a\r\nnecessary step to ensure that all countries manage their\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nwaste in such a way that the health of the public is assured,\r\nand that the nuclear energy option remains sustainable. The\r\nconvention should be based on internationally accepted\r\nstandards, international cooperation and exchange of\r\ninformation.\r\nAt the beginning of this year, the Slovak Republic\r\nratified the Vienna Convention and the Joint Protocol on\r\nliability for nuclear damages. Liability for nuclear damage\r\nis a very sensitive issue for all countries, particularly those\r\nin Central and Eastern Europe, owing to its close\r\ninterrelation with technical assistance and supplies from\r\nWestern companies. We hope that solutions will be found\r\nso that the drafting work on the revision of the Vienna\r\nConvention can soon be finalized. A broadly supported text\r\nis a prerequisite for a successful diplomatic conference and\r\nthe conclusion of a convention which can attract broad\r\nadherence.\r\nIt should be underlined that Slovakia — as the first\r\ncountry to have nuclear power reactors on its territory —\r\nratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety at the beginning\r\nof this year. We urge other nations to do the same.\r\nIn the field of bilateral cooperation, the Slovak\r\nRepublic has entered into a number of intergovernmental\r\nagreements covering the exchange of information and the\r\nsupply of technology and nuclear materials and equipment\r\nfor scientific, research and energy generation purposes. The\r\nimplementation of these agreements complies strictly with\r\nthe terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and with those concluded between the Slovak\r\nRepublic and the IAEA, as well as those of a number of\r\nother international obligations and recommendations.\r\nOn the national level, a Nuclear Act is being prepared\r\nunder the direction of the Nuclear Regulatory Authority of\r\nthe Slovak Republic. This Act will declare the safe uses of\r\nnuclear energy, for peaceful purposes only, in conformity\r\nwith international treaties.\r\nIn the Slovak Republic, nuclear energy is being used\r\nexclusively for peaceful, predominantly energy-generating,\r\npurposes. The country has low national fuel and general\r\nenergy resources. Nuclear energy plays an inevitable role in\r\nthe national economy. The Slovak Republic has a long\r\ntradition in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In 1994 it rated\r\nfifth in the world, with a nearly 50 per cent share of\r\nelectricity generated at nuclear power plants. The long-term\r\nplan for the energy sector has also recognized that the role\r\nof nuclear energy is irreplaceable. It proposes that two\r\nWWER-440 type reactor units be put into operation at the\r\nMochovce site by the year 2000, with another two reactor\r\nunits at the same site to be put into operation later. In\r\naddition to the energy sector, nuclear energy is also being\r\napplied in health care, scientific research and industry.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the cooperation of the IAEA\r\nand advanced countries providing technical support,\r\nengineering services and nuclear components to\r\nSlovakia — especially in nuclear safety matters. All\r\nnuclear projects in the Slovak Republic, including the\r\nsafety upgrading of older reactor units built according to\r\nearlier safety standards and the construction of new\r\nreactor units, have a significant international character.\r\nMr. Vajpayee (India): We have heard the report of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\npresented so ably by its Director General Mr. Hans Blix,\r\nwith keen interest, and noted its contents.\r\nAs one of the founder members of the Agency, India\r\nhas consistently attached the highest importance to the\r\nIAEA’s objectives. India had the honour and privilege of\r\nbeing the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the\r\nAgency in 1994-1995. We participate actively in the\r\nmanifold functions of the Agency — be they promotional,\r\nsafety-related or regulatory.\r\nThe statute of the Agency spells out in unambiguous\r\nterms the primary function of the Agency:\r\n“To encourage and assist research on, and\r\ndevelopment and practical application of, atomic\r\nenergy for peaceful uses throughout the world.”\r\nWhile welcoming the measures and decisions taken by the\r\nAgency to strengthen its promotional activities, we call on\r\nStates to pledge their respective shares of the Assistance\r\nand Technical Cooperation Fund and to make timely\r\npayments to the Fund. We are, however, dismayed to see\r\nthe great resistance shown by some countries to backing\r\nthese consensus decisions with adequate financial support.\r\nIndia has been a staunch supporter of the Agency’s\r\ntechnical cooperation activities. In the last year or so, the\r\nAgency has taken important steps in strengthening these\r\nactivities through, inter alia, the Policy Review Seminar\r\nand development of model projects. We also welcome\r\nresolutions on the Agency’s role in extensive use of\r\nisotope hydrology for water resources management and\r\nthe regional projects associated with desalination for\r\nproducing potable water economically.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nThese, along with resolutions such as that adopted in\r\n1993 on food irradiation, are important practical examples\r\nof non-power applications of nuclear energy for the benefit\r\nof humankind. We believe the Agency can and must do\r\nmuch more in these areas, as well as addressing the issues\r\nof the underutilization of existing facilities in some of the\r\ndeveloping countries, while assisting in alleviating the\r\nfinancial problems that are hampering progress on other\r\nprojects.\r\nThe non-power applications of atomic energy in the\r\nfields of agriculture, medicine and industry have grown\r\nsignificantly. We hope that the Agency will develop more\r\nprojects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality\r\nof life of people in developing countries and that such\r\nmodel projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy. For its part, India will be\r\nready to enhance its interaction with the Agency in these\r\nareas and to share its know-how, either through the\r\ntechnical cooperation programmes of the Agency or on a\r\nbilateral basis.\r\nOne of the Agency’s most important activities, in line\r\nwith its mandate, should be to assist member States in\r\ndeveloping nuclear-power technologies and in facilitating\r\nthe exchange of technical know-how and information in this\r\nfield. The profile of this activity should be influenced solely\r\nby technical considerations. Basically, the Agency should\r\nbe an advanced technical body dealing with\r\nmultidisciplinary areas of science and technology, and\r\nshould play a proactive and catalytic role in the field of\r\natomic energy. It should be a storehouse and a\r\ndissemination centre for technical information in these\r\nareas. This kind of role of the Agency, vis-à-vis operational\r\nexperience with existing reactors and design information on\r\nadvanced reactor systems, will help in advancing the cause\r\nof nuclear safety. Such a role will benefit not only the\r\ndeveloping countries but also the developed countries. We\r\nbelieve it is high time that the Agency cooperated with\r\ndeveloping countries in facing the issues involved in\r\nactually setting up nuclear-power plants, rather than limiting\r\nits activities to comparative studies and developing\r\ndatabases. We also believe that technology-control regimes\r\nmust not prove to be a barrier to the development of\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy.\r\nConsiderable time and effort have been devoted to the\r\nstrengthening of safeguards under comprehensive\r\nsafeguards agreements. This is in line with another\r\nobjective of the Agency, which is to\r\n“ensure, so far as it is able, that assistance provided\r\nby it (...) is not used in such a way as to further any\r\nmilitary purpose” (Statute of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency, article II).\r\nExperience has shown that this has been done very\r\nsuccessfully by the Agency. However, the Agency has\r\nalso been given in its statute a function\r\n“to apply safeguards, at the request of the parties, to\r\nany bilateral or multilateral arrangement, or at the\r\nrequest of a State” (ibid., article III, para. 5).\r\nOver the years this function seems to have overtaken\r\nthe former objective. Applying safeguards is an important\r\nfunction and needs to be performed well, in the tradition\r\nof the Agency.\r\nIndia recognizes the purpose of the exercise under\r\nway on the strengthening of safeguards and improving\r\ntheir efficiency and cost- effectiveness under the\r\nprogramme called “93+2”, but advocates keeping a\r\nbalanced approach. Overreacting to any situation or\r\ncalling for measures with doubtful technical value,\r\nmeasures leading to results that may be interpreted\r\nsubjectively, and so on, may do more harm than good.\r\nSafeguards measures should be cost-effective, legally\r\nvalid, equitable and politically acceptable and must\r\nrespect the sovereignty of member States. Applying\r\nexcessive pressure could only lead to a breakdown of the\r\nsystem, as has been recently observed. Distorting the\r\nperspective by excessive use of clichés such as\r\ntransparency and voluntary submission may lead to a\r\nsituation where the Agency finds it difficult to give a\r\ncomprehensive clean chit to a member State, even — as\r\nhas also been observed — after making intrusive\r\ndemands. Anything that compromises the credibility of\r\nthe Agency as a neutral, objective body must be\r\nmeticulously avoided.\r\nSimilarly, on the issue of the implementation of the\r\nsafeguards agreement between the Agency and the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, we feel that this\r\nis a complex and substantive issue on which there have\r\nbeen many developments, both technical and political.\r\nOur viewpoint has been consistent in that we believe that\r\nthe best way to resolve this difficult issue is through\r\npatient discussion among all the parties concerned. We\r\nsupport a policy of cooperation and dialogue rather than\r\none of confrontation and imposition of deadlines, and in\r\nthis spirit we welcome the movement forward in the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\ndiscussions between the United States and the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). For this reason in the\r\nGeneral Conference we abstained on the resolution, which\r\nwe felt was not contributing to a positive result.\r\nThe threat posed by illicit trafficking in nuclear\r\nmaterials is grave, particularly when it is linked to\r\nclandestine nuclear programmes. We have noted the efforts\r\nof the Agency to help improve national systems of\r\naccounting and control, as well as its intention to develop\r\na reliable database of incidents of illicit trafficking. While\r\nprevention of illicit trafficking is entirely a national\r\nresponsibility, the Agency can help by conducting training\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe recent nuclear tests carried out by some States\r\nparties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) soon after its\r\nindefinite extension highlight the inherent defects of the\r\nTreaty. These developments will also have repercussions on\r\nthe comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. We see that\r\ntreaty as a step towards nuclear disarmament, but it will be\r\nmeaningful only if it is linked firmly to the total elimination\r\nof nuclear weapons within a stipulated time framework. Our\r\nposition on the NPT is well known. We have always\r\nunequivocally supported all efforts at non-proliferation that\r\nare universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory. A\r\nsincere attempt to reach this goal is conspicuous now by its\r\nabsence.\r\nIndia has always supported the activities of the\r\nAgency, which has evolved useful mechanisms for\r\nincreasing the interaction of member States. In addition to\r\nthe training programmes, the mechanisms of coordinated\r\nresearch and research contracts programmes are particularly\r\nuseful. Recently, India also provided some nuclear\r\ninstrumentation and related software to the IAEA\r\nLaboratory at Seibersdorf. These included iodine, air\r\nparticulate and Argon-41 monitors, which together form an\r\nEnvironmental Activity Release Monitoring System. This\r\nwill be used by the Seibersdorf Laboratories for the training\r\nof scientists and technicians. We are capable of\r\ncommercially supplying a variety of nuclear instruments to\r\nmeet the demands of the IAEA member States.\r\nBefore concluding, I should once again like to reiterate\r\nthat we extend our full support for and cooperation with the\r\nIAEA in its efforts towards promoting and enhancing the\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of the health,\r\npeace and prosperity of people throughout the world.\r\nMr. Inderfurth (United States of America): On\r\nbehalf of the United States, my delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its strong support for cosponsorship of the draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly today on the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its\r\nannual report for 1994. As the Assembly knows, the\r\nIAEA is entrusted with the dual responsibility of\r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and of\r\nguarding against its use for any military purpose. Through\r\nsafeguards, the IAEA performs an important global\r\nsecurity function and, as such, is an institution of critical\r\nimportance to the United States and the international\r\ncommunity. We commend Director General Blix and the\r\nIAEA secretariat for their continued, effective and\r\ncommitted service.\r\nThe IAEA’s extensive, effective and unique system\r\nof safeguards provides a foundation of international\r\ncooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The\r\nsafeguards system builds confidence among States that\r\ntransfers of nuclear technology and information will not\r\nbe diverted to military purposes and thereby undermine\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMy Government supports the actions taken by the\r\nIAEA and the Board of Governors for a strengthened and\r\ncost-effective safeguards programme. In particular, we\r\nsupport efforts to increase access to information and\r\nlocations in order to improve the Agency’s ability to\r\ndetect diversion of nuclear material from declared\r\nfacilities and to provide credible assurance of the absence\r\nof undeclared facilities.\r\nWith respect to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the United States has always\r\nconsidered it to be the benchmark of the international\r\nnon-proliferation regime. We believe its indefinite\r\nextension this past May confirmed the international\r\ncommunity’s commitment to preventing the spread of\r\nnuclear weapons and to enhancing global security and\r\nstability.\r\nOn the subject of Iraq, recent revelations from Iraq\r\nregarding its programmes to develop weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, confirm the extent\r\nto which that country is willing to go to deceive the\r\ninternational community and fail to honour its obligations\r\nunder relevant Security Council resolutions. The United\r\nStates commends the continuing efforts of the IAEA to\r\ndetermine the scope of Iraq’s clandestine nuclear-weapons\r\nprogramme; undertaken in clear violation of Iraq’s\r\ncommitments as a party to the NPT. We support the\r\nIAEA’s work in putting in place a long-term monitoring\r\nmechanism in Iraq, which is essential to continuing\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nefforts to thwart future Iraqi acquisition of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. I use this opportunity to call again upon Iraq to\r\nhonour fully and honestly the commitments it accepted\r\nunder Security Council resolution 687 (1971), and others,\r\nand to provide immediately all information and equipment\r\nrelating to its weapons of mass destruction programmes to\r\nthe IAEA and to the United Nations Special Commission\r\n(UNSCOM).\r\nIn pursuit of peace on the troubled Korean Peninsula,\r\nmy Government worked hard to achieve the October 1994\r\nAgreed Framework with the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea (DPRK). Under that agreement, both sides\r\naccepted obligations to defuse tensions on the Peninsula and\r\nto create a viable nuclear-energy programme in the DPRK.\r\nProgress under the Agreed Framework is continuing.\r\nHowever, none of the work currently under way would be\r\npossible without the unique role performed by the IAEA in\r\nmonitoring the freeze of the DPRK’s existing nuclear\r\nprogramme as envisaged in the Agreed Framework. There\r\nis a long way to go to achieve full implementation of this\r\nremarkable agreement. However, each step forward will\r\nstrengthen the prospect for truly lasting peace in the region.\r\nThe IAEA should take great satisfaction from its\r\ninvolvement in this important effort.\r\nThe IAEA should also take great satisfaction from\r\nserving as a catalyst for the successful conclusion of the\r\nInternational Convention on Nuclear Safety, which was\r\nopened for signature in September 1994. The safety\r\nConvention represents an effort by the international\r\ncommunity to ensure that the use of nuclear energy is safe,\r\nwell regulated and environmentally sound. Its main precept,\r\nhowever, is that the safe use of nuclear as well as other\r\nforms of energy remains essentially the national\r\nresponsibility of the respective States. Through the\r\nConvention, States will bind themselves to a number of\r\nimportant safety guidelines and accept to participate in and\r\nreport to periodic peer-review meetings to verify\r\nimplementation of the Convention’s obligations. The United\r\nStates was an original signatory of this instrument. We\r\nencourage other States to sign on and ratify the Convention.\r\nOn the subject of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy,\r\nwe commend the IAEA secretariat for its efforts to improve\r\ndelivery of technical cooperation with the creation of the\r\nmodel-project concept. We believe the effort to improve\r\nproject formulation, management and implementation can\r\nonly lead to a more efficient programme. The United States\r\nwill remain engaged in this effort. After all, it is the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy in the areas of medicine,\r\nagriculture and industry which demonstrate its concrete,\r\ntangible benefits to mankind.\r\nIn closing, my Government wishes to commend the\r\nIAEA for its invaluable contribution to international\r\npeace, security and welfare. The United States pledges its\r\ncontinuing strong support for the important work of the\r\nIAEA.\r\nMr. Sha Zukang (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The Chinese delegation has listened attentively\r\nto the statement by Mr. Hans Blix, Director General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and\r\ntakes note of the report of the Agency. I wish to express,\r\non behalf of the Chinese delegation, our appreciation for\r\nthe Agency’s efforts last year in promoting international\r\ncooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in\r\nnuclear non-proliferation.\r\nOver the past year progress has been made in the\r\nfield of international cooperation in peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy and in nuclear non-proliferation. Last May,\r\nin this very Hall, the States parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) decided\r\nwithout a vote to extend the NPT indefinitely and\r\nadopted the “Principles and Objectives on Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation and Disarmament” and the\r\n“Strengthening of the Review Mechanism of the [NPT]”.\r\nThese results of the NPT Review Conference are useful\r\nfor the enhancement of the international nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime and the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and would help to\r\nenhance the role of the IAEA in promoting peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy and therefore would conform to the\r\ninterests of all States parties.\r\nPromoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as well\r\nas international cooperation in this field, is one of the\r\nmain objectives set forth in the statute of the IAEA. The\r\nChinese delegation is pleased to note that the Agency has\r\nin recent years undertaken some tentative reform\r\nmeasures in the field of technical cooperation and\r\nassistance. The model projects proposed and initially\r\nimplemented by the Agency’s secretariat have taken into\r\nfull account the economic-development priorities and\r\nspecific requirements of the recipient countries. These\r\nprojects, therefore, have received the support of the\r\nrecipient Governments and are showing good prospects\r\nfor socio-economic benefits. China attaches importance to\r\nthese projects. In 1994, the Chinese Government pledged\r\na donation of $1 million to the Agency, mainly to finance\r\ntwo model Agency projects in Africa. To help promote\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nthese projects, this year the Chinese Government has again\r\npledged to the Agency $200,000.\r\nThe prevention of nuclear proliferation has a bearing\r\non the maintenance of international peace and security. It\r\nis an important issue of wide concern to the IAEA member\r\nStates as to how the Agency should proceed from its statute\r\nand relevant international agreements and fulfil its\r\nsafeguards functions in a fairer and more effective manner.\r\nChina attaches importance to the safeguards of the Agency,\r\nappreciates the efforts of the Agency’s secretariat in its\r\nimplementation of Programme “93+2”, and has taken note\r\nof a whole set of measures proposed by the secretariat to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards\r\nregime. China believes that the improved safeguards system\r\nshould be fair, objective, rational, transparent and feasible,\r\nand implemented strictly in accordance with the statute and\r\nrelevant international agreements, on the basis of respect for\r\nthe sovereignty of countries concerned, without jeopardizing\r\ntheir legitimate rights.\r\nChina holds that the strengthening of the safeguards\r\nregime must avoid any adverse effect on the development\r\nof nuclear science, technology and industry in various\r\ncountries, or on international cooperation in peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy. Any discrimination or abuse of\r\nsafeguards information and verification must be avoided.\r\nChina holds that the indefinite extension of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) should\r\nnot be interpreted as allowing the perpetual possession of\r\nnuclear weapons by nuclear-weapon countries. China\r\nconsistently stands for the complete prohibition and\r\nthorough destruction of nuclear weapons and works for the\r\nearly realization of a nuclear-weapon-free world. As a State\r\nparty to the NPT and a member of the IAEA, China has\r\nfulfilled in good faith its obligations in the field of\r\ninternational cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy,\r\nthe prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and\r\nthe promotion of nuclear disarmament.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. At a time when we are\r\nappraising the efforts of the United Nations in the past 50\r\nyears in promoting international peace and development, we\r\nexpect the IAEA, an important specialized agency of the\r\nUnited Nations, to play an increased role in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy\r\nand the prevention of nuclear proliferation. China will, as\r\nalways, work with all other member countries of the IAEA\r\nfor the achievement of the objectives set out in the statute.\r\nMr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): My delegation has\r\nassociated itself with the statement of the European Union\r\npresented by the delegation of Spain earlier in the\r\nmeeting, and I will therefore limit myself to a few\r\nadditions and points of emphasis. The Czech Republic\r\nviews the IAEA as one of the most important bodies\r\nwithin the United Nations system, and welcomed its\r\nannual General Conference held in Vienna from 18 to 22\r\nSeptember 1995. During its thirty-ninth session, the\r\nGeneral Conference concentrated on evaluating the\r\nIAEA’s activities in the previous period, and we consider\r\nthe previous year a successful one.\r\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the thorough\r\nevaluation of all aspects of implementing it were the most\r\nimportant events of the year. We recall the difficulties we\r\nfaced on the way to this objective. But member States\r\nhave now explicitly committed themselves to exclusively\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, and very clearly\r\nreiterated their “no” to any threat of world destruction by\r\nnuclear weapons. These accomplishments fully coincide\r\nwith the foreign policy objectives of the Czech Republic.\r\nNo discussion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy can\r\navoid issues of nuclear safety: that is, the safe operation\r\nof nuclear facilities, safe management of nuclear waste,\r\nprotection against radiation, and liability for nuclear\r\ndamage. Signing the Convention on Nuclear Safety,\r\nduring the thirty-eighth session of the IAEA General\r\nConference, was an important step in allaying these\r\nconcerns. The Czech Republic was among the first 20\r\nsignatories of the Convention, and our Parliament ratified\r\nit on 23 May 1995. My country encourages all member\r\nStates which have not yet done so to sign and ratify the\r\nConvention, so that it may enter into force as soon as\r\npossible. This too is what GC(39)/RES/13 of the General\r\nConference invited them to do.\r\nThe issue of the safe manipulation of nuclear waste\r\nis one of our main priorities. Preparing the draft of the\r\nrelevant convention and convening an expert session in\r\nVienna in June 1995 were steps in the right direction. We\r\ndo not assume that working out the final draft of the new\r\nconvention will be problem-free. Nevertheless, our\r\ncommon objective — global protection of the population\r\nagainst the irresponsible manipulation of nuclear waste —\r\nshould help us to find generally acceptable language.\r\nOf course, acceptance of a convention does not\r\nautomatically assure its objectives. An operational\r\nmultilateral verification mechanism which will dispel\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nconcerns about breaches of its provisions is essential for\r\nachieving the objective in question. My delegation respects\r\nthe IAEA’s role in providing safeguards at nuclear facilities\r\nall over the world. We continue to support the Agency’s\r\neffort to develop a strengthened safeguard system based on\r\nthe so-called Programme “93+2”, which integrates all\r\nproven items of the present system with certain additional\r\nmeasures. We welcome the adoption of GC(39)/RES/17,\r\nwhich requested the Director General of the IAEA to\r\nimplement, at an early date, measures outlined in Part 1 of\r\ndocument GOV/2807 and as soon as possible, after\r\nconsulting member States, to put before the Board of\r\nGovernors clear proposals for measures suggested in Part 2.\r\nAs we appreciate the necessity to ensure sufficient\r\nfinancial means for inspections on the basis of collective\r\nresponsibility, we welcome the agreement on a new system\r\nof financing safeguards as well as on voluntary\r\ncontributions to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation\r\nFund, approved by the IAEA General Conference. The\r\nCzech Republic is committed to paying its pledges in full\r\nand on time.\r\nEven though my country acceded only two years ago\r\nto the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear\r\nDamage, we welcome attempts to amend the present text of\r\nthis Convention so that it also covers areas not exhaustively\r\ncovered currently. We believe that the Standing Committee\r\non Liability for Nuclear Damage should focus on revising\r\nthe Vienna Convention, and are open to all ideas\r\nconcerning more universal coverage. We consider the\r\nsupplementary funding issue a very important component of\r\nthese discussions.\r\nIllicit trafficking in nuclear material is a most serious\r\nmatter. We fully support the steps the Agency has taken in\r\norder to stop it. In view of our geographical location, we\r\nparticularly appreciate close regional cooperation in this\r\nmatter.\r\nThe Czech Republic supports the IAEA’s effort to\r\nmonitor the freeze of the nuclear programme in specified\r\nfacilities in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,\r\naccording to the mandate the IAEA has from the United\r\nNations Security Council. The Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea should meet its obligations and fully\r\nimplement the full scope of safeguards within its territory.\r\nWe also appeal to its authorities to provide the Agency with\r\nall necessary information to help complete the country’s\r\ninitial report on the inventory of its nuclear material subject\r\nto safeguards.\r\nIn the light of the detection of further details of the\r\nIraqi nuclear-weapon development programme in August\r\n1995, we also fully support the Agency’s right to continue\r\nto monitor every aspect of Iraq’s ability to develop\r\nnuclear weaponry. In GC(39)/RES/5, the General\r\nConference appealed to Iraq to cooperate consistently\r\nwith the Agency, particularly with regard to the ongoing\r\nmonitoring and verification plan.\r\nI wish to express my delegation’s appreciation and\r\nsupport for the work of Director General, Mr. Hans Blix,\r\nand of the Agency’s secretariat, which performs\r\nexcellently even under difficult financial circumstances.\r\nAnd in conclusion, my delegation recommends the\r\nadoption of the draft resolution concerning the IAEA, of\r\nwhich we are a sponsor exactly as submitted.\r\nMr. Hudyma (Ukraine) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The delegation of Ukraine would like to thank\r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) for his comprehensive and well-balanced\r\nreport on the work of the Agency last year. It is clear\r\nfrom the report that the Agency has continued the\r\nsuccessful performance of its activities in promoting\r\nworldwide cooperation in the peaceful and safe use of\r\nnuclear energy.\r\nI also welcome the fact that the IAEA is seen as one\r\nof the most effective Agencies of the United Nations.\r\nThere is no doubt that this organ plays an important role\r\nin ensuring the non-use of nuclear energy for military\r\npurposes, rendering assistance to Member States,\r\nenhancing the safety of nuclear activities within States\r\nand disseminating nuclear technology for applications in\r\nvarious fields. I am convinced that the IAEA, as an organ\r\nof the United Nations system specializing in the nuclear\r\nfield, will continue to promote peace and security\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThis year was marked by a truly historic event in the\r\npromotion of nuclear non-proliferation: the indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), whose fundamental importance\r\nin preventing the spread of nuclear weapons has been\r\nproved over the 25 years of its existence. Ukraine\r\nacceded to the Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon State and\r\nis doing all it can to do away with the nuclear potential\r\nit inherited from the former Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics (USSR). I should like to express the conviction\r\nthat this well-thought-out and deliberate decision by my\r\nGovernment, along with its consistent support of the need\r\nto make the Treaty permanent, helped promote the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nsuccess of the Conference of the Parties to the NPT, which\r\nwas held in this very Hall.\r\nWe also welcome the progress made in other\r\nimportant areas of arms control and disarmament and wish\r\nto express the hope that the Conference on Disarmament\r\nwill complete negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty in 1996 and that it will make significant progress in\r\nits work on a convention to ban the production of fissile\r\nmaterials for military purposes. We take a favourable view\r\nof the efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nAfrica, as well as the willingness expressed by the United\r\nStates, the United Kingdom and France to accede, after\r\nRussia and China, to the Protocols of the Treaty of\r\nRarotonga. My Government is convinced that these steps\r\nwill promote the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones in other regions of the world as well.\r\nThe IAEA safeguards play an important role in the\r\nimplementation of the NPT. Thanks to the effective\r\noperation of the safeguards system and the consolidation of\r\ncooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the\r\nAgency is contributing significantly to strengthening general\r\nsafety and ensuring general development. In the future the\r\nIAEA should resolve matters related to the more complex\r\ntasks in the ongoing process of nuclear disarmament, which\r\nwill remain an immutable reality.\r\nIn its desire to promote fully the consolidation of the\r\nsafeguards system, Ukraine stated its readiness, at the\r\nthirty-ninth session of the IAEA, to sign the agreement\r\nrelevant to its accession to the NPT. I should also like to\r\nnote that the current agreement between Ukraine and the\r\nIAEA on the application of safeguards to all nuclear\r\nmaterials and all peaceful nuclear activities in Ukraine,\r\ndespite the country’s extremely problematic economic\r\nsituation, is being successfully implemented as of last\r\nJanuary. With the Agency’s direct and active support and\r\nassistance, significant work has been done to implement the\r\nprovisions of this agreement, including the establishment of\r\na Government system for the accounting and monitoring of\r\nnuclear materials, inspections, training of personnel and the\r\npreparation of the necessary technical facilities. Ukraine\r\nattaches great importance to the linkages in the Agency’s\r\nfundamental activities between safeguards, safety and\r\ntechnology transfer. Ensuring the safety of nuclear\r\ntechnology, nuclear-waste management and cooperation in\r\nthe various applications of nuclear technology all depend on\r\nthe assurance that nuclear energy and technology are being\r\nused exclusively for peaceful purposes.\r\nUkraine was among the first signatories of the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety. We believe that high\r\nstandards of protection and of nuclear-waste management\r\nare extremely important if the use of nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes is to be continued. At the end of 1995\r\nthe Ukraine’s Supreme Council passed a law on the use\r\nof nuclear energy and radiological protection, which was\r\ndrafted in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety. Work is now under way\r\nto align domestic legislation and safety regulations with\r\nthe requirements of this new law. We hope to complete\r\nthis process in the very near future so that the Convention\r\non Nuclear Safety can be submitted for ratification as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine welcomes the significant\r\nprogress made in the establishment of standards for\r\nnuclear-waste management and in the drafting of a\r\nrelevant convention. Ukraine participates in the group of\r\nexperts established for that purpose and hopes that the\r\nactive approach of all States will make it possible to\r\nreach a long-term consensus solution to the problem of\r\nnuclear-waste management. In this connection, we wish\r\nto note that Ukraine has adopted a law on regulating\r\nnuclear-waste management, which is a very important\r\nsphere of activity.\r\nAnother important problem for the international\r\nsystem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is illicit\r\ntrafficking in nuclear materials. We believe that, even\r\nthough States themselves are responsible for an adequate\r\nand effective level of physical protection against nuclear\r\nmaterials, the IAEA and other international organizations\r\ncan play an important role in ensuring international\r\ncooperation, including by providing technical assistance\r\nto countries in fields other than law-enforcement. We\r\nconsider it important for the IAEA to take the measures\r\nneeded to improve the Agency’s existing database on\r\nillicit traffic in nuclear materials, and we believe this\r\ndatabase should include information on other sources of\r\nradioactivity. We call upon all States to take national\r\nmeasures that would promote the operation of such a\r\nsystem.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to touch upon yet another\r\nproblem of exceptional importance to my country: the\r\nquestion of the future of the Chernobyl plant and of\r\nenergy in Ukraine as a whole. Nuclear energy continues\r\nto play a significant role in our country’s economy.\r\nNuclear power plants produce over a third of all the\r\nelectrical power generated in Ukraine, and the proportion\r\nof atomic energy in our country’s energy supply continues\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nto rise. As for shutting down Chernobyl, we are pleased to\r\nnote that this question is receiving the international\r\ncommunity’s attention. We welcome the Agency’s initiative\r\nto convene in the spring of 1996 an international conference\r\nin connection with the tenth anniversary of the accident in\r\nChernobyl’s block IV. At the same time, the negotiating\r\nprocess on the proposals adopted by the Big Seven in\r\nNaples in 1994 regarding ways and means to shut down\r\nChernobyl has not yet been completed. The President of\r\nUkraine has stated his plans to shut down Chernobyl before\r\nthe year 2000, on condition that large-scale assistance\r\nrendered to Ukraine in the fields of energy and nuclear\r\nsafety as a whole be fully in line with the realities existing\r\nin Ukraine today.\r\nAt the end of the summer, in his letter to the Heads of\r\nState of the Big Seven, the President of Ukraine confirmed\r\nUkraine’s position on this issue. However, he pointed out\r\nagain that the West’s delay in providing the promised\r\nassistance would force Ukraine to act on the basis — first\r\nand foremost of national priorities as well as our country’s\r\neconomic and technical capacities.\r\nFor Ukraine, which is carrying out economic reforms\r\nunder complex financial-economic conditions, assistance\r\nfrom other States in resolving the problems of Chernobyl\r\nwill have a decisive impact.\r\nIn addition, we cannot speak of shutting down the\r\nChernobyl plant without an understanding of problems\r\nconnected with ensuring safety in the plant and in the\r\nUkritiye facility and rehabilitating the contaminated area as\r\na whole. I should like to point out that to date all the work\r\nrelated to the safe operation of the Chernobyl plant and the\r\nrehabilitation of the contaminated Ukritiye territory is being\r\ncarried out by Ukraine independently, without any support\r\nfrom the international community and that Ukraine is\r\nspending annually over $100 million to this end.\r\nUkraine considers that one of the possible ways to\r\nobtain an objective analysis of and to solve the problems\r\nconnected with the Chernobyl accident would be to set up\r\nan international technological research centre which would\r\ndeal with issues related to the elimination of the\r\nconsequences of nuclear radiological accidents and in\r\nwhose work leading experts from various countries in the\r\nworld could participate. We call upon all countries to\r\ncooperate in the establishment of such a centre.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to assure the General\r\nAssembly that Ukraine will continue to play a constructive\r\nrole in resolving the important tasks connected with the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nMr. Raichev (Bulgaria): At the outset I should like\r\nto express my delegation’s strong support for the views\r\ncontained in the statement of the representative of Spain\r\nmade on behalf of the European Union and the States\r\nassociated with it. Bulgaria, as one of those States, shares\r\nthe attitudes set forth in the statement.\r\nMy delegation commends the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), under the able leadership of\r\nMr. Hans Blix, for its continuing success in adapting to\r\na series of new and demanding challenges over the past\r\nyear. The report that the Director General introduced on\r\nthe activities of the Agency in 1994 demonstrates that its\r\ntasks have been undertaken in a way that inspires\r\nconfidence and appreciation from the member States. For\r\nthis reason, my delegation is a co-sponsor of draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.11, on the Agency’s annual report.\r\nThe thirty-ninth session of the General Conference\r\nof the IAEA met in a year that was a landmark for\r\nnuclear non-proliferation. On 11 May the Review and\r\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons took the historic\r\ndecision to extend the Treaty indefinitely, to strengthen\r\nthe review process and to adopt a set of principles and\r\nobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\r\nWe welcome this outcome, which is in the best security\r\ninterests of all.\r\nThe Review and Extension Conference recognized\r\nthe outstanding role of the IAEA in implementing the\r\nbasic provisions of the Treaty. The outcome of the\r\nConference has far-reaching implications for the work of\r\nthe Agency, particularly as regards the safeguards system,\r\nwhich underpins a major part of the non-proliferation\r\nregime and international cooperation in the field of the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nThe IAEA was expressly recognized as the\r\ncompetent authority responsible for verifying and assuring\r\ncompliance with safeguards agreements. We support the\r\nAgency’s ongoing activities aimed at strengthening the\r\neffectiveness and improving the efficiency of the\r\nsafeguards regime. The development of measures to\r\nenhance the IAEA system of safeguards is progressing\r\nwell, and excellent results were achieved at the June\r\nmeeting of the Board of Governors. We look forward to\r\nconsidering further detailed Agency proposals on part II\r\nmeasures of the Programme “93+2” later this year. There\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nis no doubt that the IAEA full-scope safeguard agreements\r\nare of universal benefit and will remain the key element in\r\nencouraging international cooperation in the peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy.\r\nThe resolution adopted at last year’s General\r\nConference on the strengthening of the Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation activities has resulted in a number of initiatives\r\nwhich need to be commended. Compared with past years,\r\nthe level of implementation of the Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme has been the highest. Of special interest also\r\nare the proposals for a country programme framework and\r\nthe model-project approach, which broaden the principal\r\nobjective of technical cooperation toward the achievement\r\nof social and economic goals. In our view, these activities\r\nshould be further developed and expanded.\r\nIn 1994 Bulgaria continued to fulfil its obligations\r\nunder the safeguards agreement with the IAEA. During the\r\nyear, there has been no change in the number and\r\noperational status of our nuclear facilities, which total six\r\noperating nuclear power reactors, one repository for spent\r\nnuclear fuel, and one research reactor. The Agency carried\r\nout eight inspections on two technical visits to check up on\r\nthe inventory and the accountancy for our nuclear material.\r\nThe official statements of the IAEA on the findings of the\r\ninspections have shown that my country is strictly\r\nobserving its commitment under the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nNuclear power and nuclear methods and techniques are\r\nwidely used in various sectors of our national economy.\r\nNuclear power plays a significant role in meeting the power\r\nneeds of the country. For example, in 1994 only 45.6 per\r\ncent of power production was of nuclear origin. Very\r\nserious attention is being paid to ensure safety at the\r\nKozloduy nuclear power plant. Long-term measures are\r\ntaken to ensure safety conditions; these could be best\r\ndescribed as “sustainable safety”. In all our efforts during\r\nthe past several years aimed at enhancing nuclear safety, we\r\nhave been supported by the IAEA. In cooperation with the\r\nAgency, national projects have been implemented, such as\r\nthose of the improvement of national regulatory standards\r\non nuclear and radiational safety, for the modernization of\r\nthe equipment for tritium measurement in the radiochemical\r\nlaboratory of Sofia University; and for the assessment of\r\nthe safety at the sites of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant\r\nand the Belene nuclear power plant, in particular their\r\nseismic characteristics and the seismic rigidity of the\r\nbuildings and facilities.\r\nBulgaria participated in the regional projects for\r\nEastern Europe related to safety of the water-cooled and\r\nmoderated type reactor (WWER) safety, spent fuel\r\nrepositories, radioactive waste management and\r\nstrengthening of regulatory bodies. Bulgaria participates\r\nin the international system of nuclear information and the\r\nsystem for incident reporting.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm our intention\r\nto cooperate fully with the Agency’s member States and\r\nits secretariat with a view to attaining the goals we have\r\nset together for the future performance of the IAEA.\r\nMr. Al-Awoi (Kuwait) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe discuss today one of the most important items on the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda. The item’s importance is\r\nmuch greater at this session in view of the nature of the\r\nnew developments that have taken place with regard to\r\nthe work and competence of the IAEA.\r\nMy delegation is fully aware of the important task\r\nundertaken by the Agency in the areas of nuclear power,\r\nnuclear technologies, nuclear safety, radiation protection\r\nand the management of radioactive wastes. We are aware\r\nalso of the assistance extended by the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency to developing countries in all\r\nthese areas. As we commemorate at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, with special emphasis on the Organization’s\r\nmajor objective of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, we must acknowledge that the Agency now\r\nperforms one of the most important roles in striving after\r\nthat objective. We must emphasize also that the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons poses a real threat to\r\nsecurity and stability at the international and regional\r\nlevels.\r\nThe vital role of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency has acquired added importance through the world\r\ncommunity’s realization of the clear connection between\r\ndisarmament and development. Huge military\r\nexpenditures impede economic development and adversely\r\naffect the content and scope of international economic\r\ncooperation. Accordingly, the Agency’s role in making\r\nsure that nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes, is\r\nvital for the promotion of international peace and security\r\nand, thereby, works in favour of one of the major\r\nobjectives of our Organization.\r\nThe international community has witnessed two\r\nimportant developments in the two areas of proliferation\r\nor control of weapons of mass destruction. The most\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nimportant development I can refer to today is the success\r\nachieved last April with the indefinite extension of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nMy country believes that this Treaty is the cornerstone of\r\nthe international regime that prevents the proliferation of\r\none of the most deadly of overkill weapons that cause\r\nconcern for all countries of the world. We, therefore, call\r\nupon Israel once again to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons in response to the\r\nfundamental requirement of peace in the region.\r\nIt is only right that I should refer to the second of\r\nthose two developments in the area of controlling the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in the wake\r\nof the grave and tremendous information that has been\r\nunearthed recently concerning Iraq’s armaments\r\nprogramme. Had it not been for the grace of God, the\r\nefforts of the Special Commission that has been entrusted\r\nwith the task of destroying Iraq’s weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and the efforts of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, Iraq would have been able to destabilize\r\nthe whole of the Middle East region and of the world at\r\nlarge. The recent unearthing of the grave details of the\r\narmaments programmes that Iraq had kept secret is a\r\nserious development indeed, not in terms of the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons alone, but also as a breach\r\nand a violation of the safety measures that the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency stresses very strongly indeed.\r\nMy delegation wishes to extend its thanks and\r\nappreciation to the Director General of the IAEA and to his\r\nstaff, and to the Chairman of the Special Commission for\r\nthe untiring efforts deployed in following up Iraq’s\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 687 (991),\r\n707 (1991) and 715 (1991). However, my country is keen\r\nthat the pressure be maintained to force Iraq to implement\r\nthese resolutions in a manner that would put paid to the\r\nthreats Iraq poses to the countries of the region, especially\r\nin view of that country’s known preparation, following its\r\ninvasion of Kuwait, of a crash programme that aimed at\r\nproducing nuclear weapons in a short period of time, from\r\nthe high-grade uranium it extracted from the nuclear fuels\r\nof its two reactors. This was scheduled to reach completion\r\nby April 1991. However, the Allies’ aerial bombardment\r\nduring the liberation of my country put a stop to that\r\noperation, thanks be to Allah.\r\nThis, without a doubt, exposes Iraq’s lies in its official\r\nstatements to the Security Council wherein it had insisted\r\nthat it had halted all research and development operations\r\nrelating to the production of nuclear weapons with the\r\nbeginning of its invasion of my country. Mr. Hans Blix has\r\nassured the members of the Security Council recently that\r\nIraq’s attempt to use enriched uranium in September 1991\r\nconstituted a clear breach of the agreement signed by Iraq\r\nand the International Atomic Energy Agency. He has also\r\nstressed the fact that Iraq’s concealment of the latest\r\ninformation over the past four years was in flagrant\r\nviolation of its commitments under the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nThe fears and anxieties caused by Iraq’s armaments\r\nprogramme do not arise from its possession of nuclear\r\nweapons alone. Those fears and anxieties extend to other\r\nweapons of mass destruction, especially chemical and\r\nbiological weapons. Iraq has made great strides in that\r\ndirection too. What causes special concern to Kuwait,\r\nhowever, is that Iraq has not yet acceded to the NPT\r\nwhile all its actions and intentions show that it constitutes\r\na threat to peace and security in the region.\r\nKuwait is absolutely convinced that it is imperative\r\nto consolidate all efforts in trying to develop the human\r\nrace and to safeguard its right to live in peace and\r\nsecurity without the fears and anxieties caused by\r\nweapons for its extermination and without any threat to\r\nits stability or to its aspirations after a better world.\r\nThe human race deserves to be prepared for a world\r\nwherein advanced technology would be used to ensure the\r\nprosperity and development of humanity and not for the\r\npurpose of its destruction and effacement from the face of\r\nthe earth. This can be achieved only through the deep\r\nconviction that international relations should be governed\r\nby the principles of peace, democracy, freedom, the equal\r\nsovereignty of States and the promotion of peaceful\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Al-Akwa (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAs representatives must be hungry by now, I promise that\r\nmy statement will not be long.\r\nI should like, at the outset, to express our deep\r\nthanks and appreciation to the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) for its assistance to the\r\ndeveloping countries, including our country, the Republic\r\nof Yemen, to which the Agency has granted several\r\nfellowships and technical grants in the fields of health,\r\nagriculture and pharmacology. We commend also the\r\nIAEA Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, and his\r\ncolleagues for their efforts in the preparation of the report\r\non the Agency’s activities in 1994.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nThere is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the\r\nresponsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our\r\nappreciation and respect in view of their positive returns\r\nwith regard to the safety and security of the whole world,\r\non the one hand, and, on the other, their contribution to\r\nsocial and economic development and other activities by\r\nfacilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful\r\nuse in the developing countries.\r\nIn the field of world peace and security, the Agency\r\nmust be able to give sufficient guarantees, and it undertakes\r\nthe full supervision of nuclear installations in various\r\ncountries to ensure that nuclear energy is not used in a\r\nmanner that would endanger international peace and\r\nsecurity. In this connection, we call upon the countries\r\nconcerned to enhance their cooperation with the Agency\r\nand to support in order for the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency to be able to discharge the statutory functions\r\nmandated to it by its statute and enshrined in Treaties on\r\nthe prevention of nuclear threats and damage.\r\nIn this context, we hope that the nuclear States will\r\nmeet their commitments to the non-nuclear States in\r\naccordance with Article VI of the NPT following the\r\nReview and Extension Conference of April 1995.\r\nWe invoke international legality in calling on the\r\ninternational community to encourage the establishment of\r\nzones of peace wherever they may be needed throughout\r\nthe world, and particularly in the Middle East region, which\r\ncontinues to be threatened by the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons because a certain country refuses to accede to the\r\nNPT and to place its facilities under the IAEA inspection\r\nand safeguards system.\r\nPeace, in our conviction and the conviction of others,\r\nis an indivisible whole. The international community must\r\ntherefore take the necessary measures to ensure the\r\nuniversality and comprehensive nature of the NPT, without\r\nexception for any State of the region. Perhaps the most\r\nimportant measure in this regard is to begin to work for the\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nReturning to questions relating to the IAEA, we\r\nsupport the call for expanding the membership of the\r\nAgency’s Board of Governors in order to reflect current\r\neconomic and political developments and the democratic\r\nnature of the post-cold-war world. To this end, we should\r\nreconsider Article VI of the Agency’s statute. In this\r\nregard, we support the initiative of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco as contained in document GOV/2814/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): My delegation\r\nwishes to express its deep appreciation to Director\r\nGeneral Hans Blix of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) for his excellent and informative report.\r\nWe also commend Mr. Blix and, through him, the\r\nsecretariat of the Agency for the devotion and\r\nprofessionalism with which they have carried out their\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nSafeguards and technical cooperation are the twin\r\npillars of the IAEA’s responsibilities. In both areas, the\r\nAgency is faced with daunting challenges. Now that the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) is indefinitely extended, the Agency’s mandate to\r\nverify States Parties’ undertakings under the Treaty has\r\nbeen put on a permanent footing. The challenge for the\r\nAgency in this connection is to keep providing credible\r\nassurances on States Parties’ compliance with their\r\nnon-proliferation commitments in an increasingly volatile\r\ninternational security environment and amidst a rapid\r\nquantitative increase in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy and constant advances in nuclear technology.\r\nThe Agency’s safeguards system, which is primarily\r\naimed at verifying the non-diversion of nuclear material\r\nfrom declared facilities, has revealed serious shortcomings\r\nin recent cases of non-compliance. Providing assurances\r\nwith respect to the absence of undeclared activities of\r\nNPT States Parties has now become indispensable if the\r\nAgency is to fulfil its mandate under the Treaty. In this\r\nregard, my Government attaches great importance to the\r\nAgency’s measures to strengthen the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of the safeguards system under Programme\r\n“93+2”. We welcome the IAEA Board of Governors’\r\nendorsement of Part I of the Programme last June and\r\nlook forward to the early adoption of Part II.\r\nWe attach particular importance to those measures\r\ndesigned to strengthen the Agency’s capability to detect\r\nundeclared nuclear activities, including environmental\r\nmonitoring and no-notice inspection. A more effective\r\nsafeguards system is a necessary condition for verifying\r\nStates parties’ non-proliferation commitments, but it is not\r\na sufficient condition to deter a determined State from\r\ndeveloping nuclear weapons. Programme “93+2” can\r\nattain its intended purpose only when the States parties\r\nare willing to cooperate with the IAEA inspectorate in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme.\r\nThe strengthened safeguards system is not only\r\nimportant from the perspective of nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation. It is all the more important for the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\ncontribution it can make to the promotion of the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy by fostering an international climate\r\nof mutual confidence through greater worldwide nuclear\r\ntransparency. The IAEA’s technical cooperation\r\nprogrammes are designed precisely to promote the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy. In fact, one of the tangible benefits\r\ndeveloping countries expect from accession to the NPT is\r\ntechnical cooperation from the IAEA. Therefore, what\r\nmany developing countries have expected of donor\r\ncountries in the wake of the indefinite extension of the NPT\r\nis a gesture of political goodwill in funding the Agency’s\r\ntechnical cooperation programmes. In this connection, my\r\ndelegation wishes to express its concern at the declining\r\ninterest of donor countries in technical cooperation\r\nfinancing. If the IAEA is going to fulfil its statutory\r\nresponsibilities in the promotion of the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy, we believe that it is essential to put the\r\nfinancing of the Agency’s technical cooperation activities\r\non a secure and predictable footing.\r\nFor many developing countries, nuclear power is one\r\nof the most viable options for meeting the growing energy\r\nrequirements of environmentally sustainable development.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has 10 power reactors in operation\r\nand six units under construction, which supply roughly\r\none-third of its electricity needs. As such, nuclear power\r\nhas proved to be the most economical and clean source of\r\nenergy, permitting sustained economic growth in my\r\ncountry. The Republic of Korea is willing to share with\r\nother countries the technical capabilities and experiences in\r\nthe application of nuclear energy that it has accumulated\r\nover the years.\r\nCentral to the promotion of nuclear energy is nuclear\r\nsafety. In this respect, we call upon those countries which\r\nhave not done so to ratify the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety without further delay. We welcome the adoption of\r\nSafety Fundamentals by the IAEA Board of Governors and\r\nlook forward to the finalization of the convention on the\r\nsafe management of radioactive waste at the earliest date.\r\nMy Government shares the view that the time has\r\ncome to reform the IAEA Board of Governors through the\r\namendment of Article VI of the Agency’s statute. In our\r\nview, the current composition of the Board does not\r\nproperly reflect the fundamental and structural changes that\r\nthe international nuclear community has undergone since\r\nthe last reform of the Board more than 20 years ago.\r\nWe strongly believe that the Board should be\r\nrestructured in such a way as to accommodate the dynamic\r\nfeatures of underlying international realities. A timely\r\nreform is indispensable not only for the organizational\r\nvitality of the Agency, but also for maintaining the\r\nrepresentativeness of the Board and the relevance of its\r\ndecisions. We also call for transparency in the practice of\r\ndesignating Board members. The designation process\r\nshould be guided by objective criteria and conducted in\r\ncompliance with the relevant provisions of the IAEA\r\nstatute.\r\nTurning now to the North Korean nuclear issue, we\r\nnote that the long- standing international efforts to resolve\r\nthe issue have entered a new phase with the signing of\r\nthe US-DPRK Agreed Framework on 21 October 1994 in\r\nGeneva. We welcomed the Agreed Framework as a\r\npositive step toward the ultimate resolution of the North\r\nKorean nuclear issue.\r\nThere has been some progress in the implementation\r\nof the Agreed Framework, including uninterrupted\r\nmonitoring by the IAEA inspectors of the freeze of\r\nspecified nuclear facilities in North Korea, as requested\r\nby the Security Council. Discussions are currently under\r\nway between the Korean Peninsula Energy Development\r\nOrganization and North Korea on the provision of light\r\nwater reactors in the context of implementation of the\r\nAgreed Framework.\r\nIt must be recalled, however, that a bilateral\r\nagreement cannot replace, supersede or detract from\r\nmultilateral obligations under the IAEA-DPRK safeguards\r\nagreement, which remains binding and in force. The\r\nAgreed Framework is a complementary instrument to\r\nbring North Korea into full compliance with its\r\nmultilateral legal obligations under the NPT and the\r\nsafeguards agreement. Despite modest progress from the\r\nstandpoint of the Agreed Framework, there is no change\r\nin the situation of North Korea’s non-compliance with its\r\nsafeguards agreement with the IAEA. While expressing\r\nour concern over North Korea’s continuing non-\r\ncompliance, we urge North Korea to come promptly into\r\nfull compliance and to take all steps the IAEA deems\r\nnecessary to preserve, intact, all relevant information on\r\nsafeguards until North Korea comes into full compliance.\r\nDPRK’s early full compliance would certainly serve\r\nnot only its own best interest, but also the integrity and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 46th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nobjectives of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime\r\nunder the NPT. We also renew our call for North Korea to\r\nabide by its undertakings under the Joint Declaration for the\r\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula signed in 1991 by\r\nthe two parties.\r\nThe world is undergoing tremendous changes as the\r\ntwenty-first century approaches. In the months and years\r\nahead, we all have to put our wisdom and capabilities\r\ntogether to open up nuclear energy for wider applications\r\nfor economic development and higher standards of living.\r\nThe Republic of Korea pledges to play its due role in this\r\nimportant field.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
