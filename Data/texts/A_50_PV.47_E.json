(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Peerthum\r\n(Mauritius), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the Agency (A/50/360)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.11)\r\nAmendment (A/50/L.12)\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): The\r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran notes with\r\nsatisfaction the annual report of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) to the General Assembly for the\r\nyear 1994, which summarizes the significant achievements\r\nof the Agency during that year. We thank Mr. Blix, the\r\nDirector General of the IAEA, for his thorough and\r\ninformative statement, which also featured the main\r\ndevelopments in the Agency’s activities during 1995.\r\nDirector-General Blix and the IAEA secretariat are to be\r\ncommended for the commitment and dedication with which\r\nthey carry out their responsibilities.\r\nAs international society draws closer, through a web\r\nof regional and international treaties, the roles of\r\ninternational organizations such as the IAEA that implement\r\nthose treaties become more relevant. Thus, efforts aimed\r\nat strengthening the IAEA’s authority and functions in\r\naccordance with its statute should be supported and\r\nfurther encouraged. In this context we welcome the\r\nrelevant decisions of the 1995 Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) concerning the activities of the\r\nIAEA, which are reflected, inter alia, in draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.11, “Report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency”. In this respect the 1995 NPT Review\r\nConference recognized that the IAEA is the competent\r\nauthority for verifying and assuring that the Treaty\r\nobligations of States Parties to the NPT are being fulfilled\r\nand that nothing should be done to undermine the\r\nAgency’s authority in that regard. We also welcome, in\r\nprinciple, the proposals that have been put forward in the\r\nConference on Disarmament to entrust the IAEA with the\r\ntask of verifying the future comprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nWe have given serious consideration to the Agency’s\r\nreport for the year 1994. It is very unfortunate that the\r\nAgency continues to operate under financial constraints,\r\nwhich in turn have had adverse effects on some of its\r\nimportant programmes. We urge member States to take\r\ntheir financial obligations more seriously and to make\r\ntheir payments in a timely manner. At the same time, in\r\nview of the present budgetary constraints, we believe that\r\nthe key objective should be cost-effectiveness.\r\nAnother issue in the Agency’s activities during this\r\nperiod has been the development of a strengthened\r\nsafeguards regime. We welcome the measures and\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\ndecisions taken by the Agency to maintain and strengthen\r\nthe effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the safeguards\r\nsystem. Iran, as an original signatory of the NPT, has\r\nalways adhered to the Agency’s safeguards system and will\r\ncontinue to support its effectiveness. Our Government has\r\npursued an open and transparent policy in this respect and,\r\nbased on that policy, took the initiative to invite the Agency\r\non two occasions to visit the nuclear facilities in Iran and\r\nverify their peaceful utilization. Subsequently, the IAEA\r\nmissions visited Iran in February 1992 and November 1993,\r\nand verifications were established to the satisfaction of the\r\nAgency. These two visits were in addition to routine\r\ninspections that are conducted regularly by the IAEA.\r\nWe commend the Agency’s efforts to enhance nuclear\r\nsafety and radiation protection, particularly in the countries\r\nof the former USSR. We firmly believe that the scope of\r\nsuch measures should be expanded to all regions that\r\noperate nuclear installations, for the risks to life, health,\r\nenvironment and security emanating from such installations\r\nare not confined to national boundaries. In this regard, a\r\nmatter of great concern to Middle East countries is the\r\ncontinued operation of the un-safeguarded, antiquated and\r\nentirely non-peaceful Demona nuclear reactor in Israel. We\r\ncall upon the international community, and the IAEA in\r\nparticular, to address this problem urgently and effectively.\r\nIt should be recalled that only South Africa’s\r\naccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) safeguards system made the African\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone a reality. A parallel exists in\r\nthe case of the Middle East. So long as Israel, with the full\r\nsupport of certain Powers, refuses to join the NPT and the\r\nIAEA safeguards system, a Middle East nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone will remain a distant goal. In this respect, the\r\ndecision of the General Conference of the IAEA at its\r\nthirty-eighth session to restore technical assistance to Israel\r\nis nothing but a reward to a nuclear proliferator and tacit\r\napproval of that regime’s access to nuclear weapons. Iran,\r\nthe country that in 1974 initiated the proposal for the\r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle\r\nEast, continues to support this initiative and is prepared to\r\nconsider any constructive idea for its realization under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran attaches great importance\r\nto international cooperation in the peaceful application of\r\nnuclear energy and has pursued with great interest the\r\npromotional role of the Agency in this field. My delegation\r\nappreciates the useful technical cooperation the Agency\r\nextends to member States in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy in the fields of agriculture, industry and medicine\r\nand other related areas such as water desalination. In this\r\nregard, one cannot but stress the importance of sustained\r\nfunding, particularly through voluntary contributions for\r\nthe Agency’s technical assistance programmes.\r\nHowever, exceptional cases of the violation of the\r\nIAEA safeguards in the recent past have provided an\r\nexcuse for certain nuclear-weapon States and some other\r\nindustrialized countries to undermine the statutory tasks\r\nand obligations of the Agency and infringe more than\r\nbefore the inalienable rights of the parties to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty, as stipulated in that Treaty, including\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, whose modest, peaceful\r\nnuclear activities have always been approved by the\r\nAgency.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me once again to express our\r\nappreciation and support to the IAEA for its efforts in the\r\npromotion of international cooperation in the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy and the non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons in all its aspects.\r\nMr. Tsepkala (Belarus): The delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus has carefully studied the report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the\r\nperiod under review and notes with satisfaction that it was\r\nprepared with a high degree of professionalism. We are\r\ngrateful to the Director General of the Agency for his\r\npresentation of the report to the General Assembly.\r\nAs is mentioned in the report, the Agency’s\r\ncontribution to international security through its\r\nverification activities and to the transfer of nuclear\r\ntechnology — in other words, to the fulfilment of the\r\nAgency’s functions related to nuclear non-proliferation —\r\ncontinued to be major focal points of its work in 1994.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus, as a country which strictly\r\nadheres to the principles of non-proliferation and makes\r\na considerable contribution to the strengthening of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime, attaches particular importance to\r\nthis activity of the Agency.\r\nHaving attained its independence, Belarus took the\r\ndecision to become a non-nuclear State. That decision\r\nwas reflected in the Constitution of the Republic.\r\nRatification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty\r\n(START) and simultaneous accession to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), as a non-\r\nnuclear State, constituted further steps in this direction.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nAs representatives of the Republic of Belarus have\r\nalready mentioned in their statements at this session,\r\nBelarus signed the safeguards agreement with the IAEA on\r\n14 April 1995 and it entered into force on 31 July 1995.\r\nThe report points out that:\r\n“The credibility of commitments made by States\r\nnot to acquire nuclear weapons has become\r\nincreasingly important, particularly as States which do\r\npossess nuclear weapons move to reduce their\r\narsenals”. (IAEA Annual Report for 1994, GC(39)/3,\r\np. 1)\r\nIn this connection, I would like to emphasize that all\r\nthe actions of our State are fully in conformity with its\r\ncommitments. In late April 1992 — in other words, ahead\r\nof time — Belarus withdrew tactical nuclear weapons from\r\nits territory and worked out a schedule of withdrawal of\r\nstrategic nuclear weapons, a schedule which it is\r\nconsistently carrying out. We also intend to strictly follow\r\nour obligations under the safeguards agreement with the\r\nIAEA.\r\nIt should be noted that it is not at all easy for a newly\r\nindependent State undergoing a severe economic crisis to\r\nkeep to these commitments. In these circumstances, we\r\ngreatly appreciate the assistance rendered by international\r\norganizations, and by some countries. The Belarusian\r\ndelegation stresses the positive role of the IAEA as\r\ncoordinator in the strengthening of the infrastructure of\r\nradiation and nuclear safety in newly independent States.\r\nPreparations by the Agency for the implementation of\r\nsafeguards, for the identification of safeguards\r\nrequirements, and for the exposition of the need for support\r\nby donor States, coordinated by the Agency, were\r\nextremely useful for Belarus. Without any doubt, training\r\nin nuclear material accountancy and training provided to\r\nfacilities personnel and organized by the Agency are also\r\nimportant.\r\nWe believe that the IAEA should continue to play a\r\nspecial role in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime. The decisions of the 1995 Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), held in May\r\n1995, all but confirm this conclusion.\r\nIllicit trafficking in nuclear material may constitute a\r\nserious threat to the security of States. Belarus is striving to\r\nstrictly fulfil its obligations under the Convention on the\r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material. At present, a\r\nproject envisaging the creation of a reliable system of\r\nphysical protection of nuclear material is being worked\r\nout in Belarus. We would be very grateful for assistance\r\nin the implementation of this project.\r\nIn 1996, we shall mark the tenth anniversary of the\r\naccident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which was\r\nthe biggest radiation catastrophe in the history of\r\nmankind. In this Hall, we have spoken more than once\r\nabout this dreadful catastrophe, which turned out to be a\r\ncalamity for the Belarusian people, and about the\r\nimmeasurable damage to the economy of the country.\r\nOur delegation is grateful to the IAEA for its\r\ncontinued support of the United Nations International\r\nCooperation on Chernobyl. As is stated in the report,\r\n“a major effort was undertaken to collect precise\r\ninformation on the increased incidence of thyroid\r\ncancers among children in Belarus, Ukraine and the\r\nRussian Federation.” (GC(39)/3, p. 147)\r\nUnfortunately, the report does not contain any information\r\non the results of this effort. Apparently, such information\r\nhad not been processed when the report was issued.\r\nA number of international conferences aimed at\r\nconsideration of problems caused by the catastrophe will\r\nbe held next year. One such conference will take place in\r\nMarch 1996 in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. It will be\r\nthe first joint conference of the European Union, Belarus,\r\nRussia and Ukraine on the aftermath of the Chernobyl\r\naccident. We are interested in the broad participation of\r\nthe representatives of United Nations Member States, the\r\nIAEA and other international organizations in this\r\nconference and will be ready to welcome all those who\r\nwould like to take part in it. Belarus will participate\r\nactively in the international conferences on Chernobyl\r\nissues to be held in Geneva and Vienna.\r\nThe organization of technical cooperation is one of\r\nthe main focuses of the IAEA activities. We support the\r\nrecommendations of the Third Technical Cooperation\r\nPolicy Review Seminar, in particular on the elaboration\r\nof country programmes for the recipients of technical\r\nassistance. Last June Belarus was visited by an IAEA\r\ntechnical-cooperation mission that, together with the\r\nrepresentatives of national institutions, worked out\r\nproposals on a country programme for Belarus. We hope\r\nthat the Agency will adopt and implement this\r\nprogramme.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nWe note with satisfaction that technical assistance to\r\nBelarus from the IAEA substantially increased in years\r\npast. However, we consider that the Agency, which is\r\ncalled on to promote development and peaceful uses of\r\natomic energy, should provide more considerable assistance\r\nto a State that does not have any nuclear-energy facilities\r\nin its territory and whose people were the victims of a\r\ncatastrophic accident at a nuclear power plant belonging to\r\nanother State. We give priority to the cooperation projects\r\naimed at minimizing the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\naccident and strengthening national infrastructure for\r\nradiation and nuclear safety.\r\nIn conclusion, the Belarusian delegation would like to\r\nemphasize that our evaluation of the Agency’s work in\r\n1994 is positive. We agree with the priorities the Agency\r\nhas set for the future and hope for close cooperation with\r\nthe Agency in resolving all problems related to the peaceful\r\nuses of atomic energy.\r\nMr. Maneka (Pakistan): At the outset, I would like to\r\nexpress, on behalf of the Pakistan delegation, our profound\r\nappreciation to Dr. Hans Blix, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his\r\nstatement on the Agency’s performance during 1994. The\r\nwidening scope of the programmes and activities of the\r\nIAEA bear witness to the dedication of Dr. Blix and his\r\ncolleagues at the Agency.\r\nPakistan has always reposed great confidence in the\r\nIAEA as an instrument both to promote nuclear cooperation\r\nand to regulate the use of nuclear technology for peaceful\r\npurposes.\r\nWe welcome the Agency’s annual report for 1994.\r\nThis comprehensive document deals with a number of\r\ncomplex and technical issues in a manner that will facilitate\r\nmeaningful discussions on the Agency’s major areas of\r\nactivity.\r\nOne central activity, or objective, of the IAEA is the\r\npromotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Despite\r\nthe negative public perceptions created in some countries\r\nand the fears aroused about the danger of nuclear\r\nproliferation, nuclear energy remains a viable and attractive\r\nenergy option for many countries, particularly fossil-fuel-\r\ndeficient developing countries. The conventional means of\r\ngenerating electricity — thermal, oil, gas and coal-fired\r\nplants — not only impose a heavy financial burden on such\r\ncountries but also constitute serious threats to the\r\nenvironment. Nuclear power, on the other hand, offers a\r\nresource-conserving, environmentally benign and\r\nfinancially feasible source of energy.\r\nIn view of its multiple benefits, Pakistan deeply\r\nappreciates the Director General’s continued interest in\r\nand support for nuclear power and welcomes his reference\r\nto a strengthened programme on the comparative\r\nassessment of energy sources for electricity generation. In\r\nthis regard, the assistance the Agency has rendered to\r\nseveral countries in providing advanced methodologies,\r\nsuch as Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED)\r\nand Wien Automatic System Planning Package (WASP),\r\nfor an integrated approach towards energy and nuclear-\r\npower planning is commendable. These methodologies\r\nshould continue to be made available and should not be\r\nconstrained by extraneous considerations.\r\nAnother area of vital concern to the majority of the\r\nmembers of the Agency is technical cooperation in the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. It is indeed a source of\r\ngreat satisfaction that in 1994 the ratio of target\r\nachievement in the Agency’s Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme was the highest ever in the history of the\r\nIAEA. Of the 12 model projects approved for 1994, 11\r\nhave been launched successfully. We wish to express our\r\nsincere appreciation to the Department of Technical\r\nCooperation for its dedicated work and innovative\r\napproaches, which brought about this unprecedented\r\nsuccess. It is hoped that the establishment of the standing\r\nadvisory group on technical assistance and cooperation\r\nwill help in further strengthening the planning and\r\nimplementation of cooperation programmes. While there\r\nwas widespread support for the model-project approach\r\nand new directions in the Technical Cooperation\r\nProgramme, contributions to the Technical Assistance and\r\nCooperation Fund (TACF) dropped to 72.5 per cent, as\r\ncompared with 76.5 per cent in 1993. The target for\r\nvoluntary contributions to the TACF in 1994 was set at\r\n$58.5 million, of which $42.4 million was pledged by\r\nMember States.\r\nAlthough contributions to the TACF are voluntary,\r\nthey support an activity that is the primary statutory\r\nresponsibility of the Agency. Pakistan has always paid its\r\ncontribution in full and on time. We are also providing\r\nfree training to the developing countries, through the\r\nAgency’s Technical Cooperation Programme, in the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. We urge all member\r\nStates to pay their contributions to the TACF in full and\r\non time in order to facilitate the implementation of the\r\nAgency’s Programme.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nPakistan has consistently adhered to and will continue\r\nto lend its fullest support to the Agency’s safeguards. This\r\nis in conformity with our commitment to nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nWhile we fully agree that the possibility of non-compliance\r\nshould be minimized or completely eliminated, it is our\r\nview that any changes in the present system should remain\r\nwithin the existing legal instruments. Also, the proposed\r\nmeasures to strengthen the safeguards should be\r\ntechnologically feasible, cost-effective and non-intrusive. In\r\nthis context, we appreciate the work done by the Standing\r\nAdvisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI)\r\nand the secretariat on Programme “93+2”, but we believe\r\nthat this important issue should be thoroughly examined and\r\nextensively discussed with member States to achieve\r\nconsensus on its legal, technical and economic aspects.\r\nPakistan has always supported activities related to the\r\nenhancement of nuclear safety. We have actively\r\nparticipated in various technical committee meetings held\r\nfor the preparation and finalization of the new International\r\nBasic Safety Standards. Pakistan was also active in the\r\ndrafting and adoption of the Convention on Nuclear Safety,\r\nand signed the Convention as an original signatory. The\r\nsuccess of the Nuclear Safety Convention will depend in\r\nlarge measure on the implementation of provisions relating\r\nto cooperation between the industrially advanced countries\r\nand the developing countries. It is through continued and\r\nunimpeded supply of safety-related information and\r\nequipment that the safety of nuclear facilities can be\r\nassured and enhanced. Such measures for nuclear safety\r\nwould be reinforced by an international agreement\r\nprohibiting attacks against all nuclear facilities. Pakistan has\r\nendeavoured to promote such an agreement. The Agency\r\ncan play an important role in its realization.\r\nWe are greatly encouraged by the passage of the\r\nIAEA General Conference resolutions relating to the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. Pakistan has\r\nalso made a sincere endeavour to keep South Asia free of\r\nnuclear weapons. In this regard, a number of proposals\r\nhave been made and we continue to hope that these\r\nproposals will evoke a positive response.\r\nThe regulatory responsibility of the Agency should not\r\nlead to the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on the\r\ntransfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nUnfortunately, restrictions have been imposed even when it\r\nis evident that no proliferation dangers are involved. At\r\ntimes even safety-related information has been refused. This\r\napproach is not conducive to the evolution of safer\r\ntechniques and methods or to the promotion of greater\r\nopenness and transparency in the field of nuclear\r\ntechnology. Since these are key objectives of the Agency\r\nwe hope that it will redouble its efforts for their\r\nachievement. The IAEA should strive to remove all\r\nimpediments to the transfer of nuclear technology for\r\npeaceful purposes.\r\nFinally, I would like to address an important\r\norganizational matter. A review of Article VI of the\r\nstatute relating to the expansion of the Board has been\r\nunder consideration for a long time. We believe that an\r\nincreased representation of the member States in the\r\nBoard will improve transparency and effectiveness. We\r\nhope that the open-ended consultative group will be able\r\nto submit concrete proposals on this issue.\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): I should like to begin this\r\nstatement by thanking the Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Hans\r\nBlix, for his comprehensive statement given to the\r\nAssembly. That statement underlined with great clarity the\r\nvital role of the IAEA in preventing the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and in promoting the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. We would also like to thank Mr. Blix for\r\nhis continuing outstanding stewardship of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAustralia’s record of support for the IAEA is long\r\nand, we would like to think, second to none. That is why\r\nwe have always attached importance to the Assembly’s\r\nconsideration of the Agency’s annual report to the United\r\nNations and to the General Assembly’s resolution with\r\nrespect to that report. We place great value on the\r\nIAEA’s international safeguards and technical cooperation\r\nactivities. These activities in both fields underpin the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). The importance accorded to them by the\r\ninternational community was reaffirmed in the decision to\r\nextend the NPT indefinitely at the historic 1995 Review\r\nand Extension Conference of the States Parties to the\r\nNPT in April/May of this year and in the accompanying\r\ndocuments on that occasion entitled “Principles and\r\nobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament”\r\nand “Strengthening the review process for the Treaty”.\r\nThe draft resolution before us today highlights the\r\nimportant work being carried out by the Agency in a\r\nnumber of fields — safeguards, technical assistance,\r\nnuclear safety, radiological protection and radioactive\r\nwaste management, to name just a few of them. In all the\r\nfields of its work, the IAEA makes a manifest\r\ncontribution to international security and non-proliferation,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nand to social and economic development. The Agency’s\r\nactivities in these fields deserve our continuing and strong\r\nsupport. The draft resolution also highlights the important\r\nmeasures and decisions the Agency has taken to strengthen\r\nthe safeguards system. This was an important element of\r\nthe decision on principles and objectives for nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament adopted at the NPT Review\r\nand Extension Conference. Australia has been actively\r\ninvolved in, and strongly supports, the Agency’s\r\nProgramme “93+2” and we hope that the second phase of\r\nthat programme, including those parts relating to short-\r\nnotice inspections and environmental monitoring, will soon\r\nbe taken forward further.\r\nWe very much regret that it has been necessary again\r\nthis year for the draft resolution to record the continuing\r\nnon-compliance of two States with their safeguards\r\nagreements under the NPT. We urge those States — Iraq\r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — to\r\ncooperate fully with the Agency in returning to full\r\ncompliance. These cases of non-compliance underline again\r\nthe importance of strengthening the safeguards system,\r\nparticularly in relation to the Agency’s capability to detect\r\nundeclared nuclear activities.\r\nTechnical cooperation is also a central element of the\r\nAgency’s activities. It is an important means of enabling\r\ndeveloping countries to have access to the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy under appropriate safeguards, in keeping\r\nwith article IV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and as set\r\nout in the Agency’s statute. This too was recognized in the\r\ndecision of the NPT Review and Extension Conference on\r\nPrinciples and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and\r\nDisarmament. Australia has long been a supporter of the\r\nAgency’s technical cooperation activities, and we welcome\r\nthe measures being introduced to improve and strengthen\r\ntheir effectiveness.\r\nOn this occasion there is special significance in our\r\nreceiving the Agency’s annual report. Last week, in this\r\nHall, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. For almost 40 years the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency has also been a central part of international\r\nlife and cooperation. As we look back on those 40 or 50\r\nyears, it is surely a source of agreement amongst us all that\r\ntwo of the burning problems we have faced — the crucial\r\nissues on which we have worked together through the years\r\nsince the end of the Second World War and since the end\r\nof colonization — are those of development and the atom.\r\nThese are amongst the crucial challenges of our time, and\r\nthey will remain so. It is in this context that one of the\r\nclosest, most devoted and most effective partners of us all\r\nis the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its\r\nmandate to ensure that we work together on development\r\nand on the atom in a world that is productive and safe.\r\nOn this occasion Australia is therefore very pleased\r\nto be one of the sponsors of the draft resolution in\r\ndocument A/50/L.11. We note that, traditionally — at\r\nleast until recent years — parallel draft resolutions have\r\nattracted the consensus support of the General Assembly\r\nas ones that take note of and endorse the activities of a\r\ntruly important international Agency. We hope that on\r\nthis special occasion — after 50 years of the United\r\nNations and 40 years of the Agency — the draft\r\nresolution before the Assembly will also attract consensus\r\nsupport.\r\nMr. Mazilu (Romania): We are pleased to start our\r\nstatement by expressing my country’s recognition of the\r\nwork carried out by the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency during 1994 and 1995. We sincerely appreciate\r\nthe efforts of the Agency’s Director General, Mr. Hans\r\nBlix, and its secretariat to promote and implement the\r\nprogramme of work approved by the General Conference\r\nand the Board of Governors.\r\nOur general views on the activity of the Agency\r\nhave already been expressed by the delegation of Spain in\r\nits statement on behalf of the European Union and\r\nassociated countries. For this reason I shill make only a\r\nfew specific comments on the Agency’s report.\r\nFirst, my delegation, like others, appreciates the\r\nwork of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the\r\nfields of non-proliferation, the promotion of peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy and the strengthening of international\r\ncooperation in respect of nuclear safety, radiological\r\nprotection and waste management. The Agency has\r\ncontinued to play an important role in the implementation\r\nof the various initiatives relating to the technical\r\ncooperation programme and in the introduction of a new\r\nprogramme to enhance the security of nuclear and\r\nradioactive material. There is no doubt that the decision\r\non principles and objectives, adopted by the NPT Review\r\nand Extension Conference, is extremely important for the\r\nactivity of the Agency because it refers to the IAEA’s\r\ncontribution in the fields of safeguards and the peaceful\r\nuse of nuclear energy.\r\nSecondly, in our view, one of the most important\r\ntasks of the Agency remains the strengthening of the\r\nsafeguards system. Certainly the Agency’s system for\r\nverifying that nuclear energy is used exclusively for\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\npeaceful purposes has a vital role to play in enhancing its\r\ncredibility. My country supports the measures introduced in\r\nrecent years by the Agency to improve the safeguards\r\nsystem — in particular, through Programme “93+2”, which,\r\nas delegations know very well, is aimed at increasing the\r\ncost-effectiveness of safeguards relating to declared nuclear\r\nmaterial and at increasing the assurance of the completeness\r\nof information on nuclear activities in States with\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements. Romania hopes for\r\ntimely implementation of the measures contained in the\r\nProgramme and will cooperate fully to that end.\r\nThirdly, in the period under consideration the Agency\r\nsuccessfully promoted important measures in the area of\r\nnuclear safety. There is no doubt that the major\r\naccomplishment in this area was the adoption, in June 1994,\r\nof the Convention on Nuclear Safety, after three years of\r\ncareful preparation and serious negotiations. In addition, the\r\nBoard of Governors approved the new Basic Safety\r\nStandards in September last year. These documents contain\r\nguidelines on responsibility for the control and safety of\r\nradiation sources, as well as for the protection of workers,\r\nthe general public and medical patients, together with\r\nguidelines for intervention levels in emergency situations.\r\nBoth the Convention and the new Basic Safety Standards\r\nsupplement the existing extensive framework of safety\r\nguidelines. It is a great pleasure for me to inform the\r\nGeneral Assembly that my country — aware of the\r\nimportance of this Convention — has already ratified it.\r\nOf greatest importance now is full implementation of\r\nthe guidelines in these major documents. The Agency has\r\ngreat responsibilities in this field. In particular, it must do\r\nmuch more in our region, where the sad Chernobyl accident\r\noccurred. Every effort should be made to enhance the safety\r\nof the existing reactors and to implement new power plants\r\nin safe conditions.\r\nIt is our duty to do everything in our power to\r\nguarantee the full protection of members of the public from\r\nexposure to radioactive materials and to prevent every\r\npossible incident giving rise to potential exposure.\r\nWe would like to underline once again the importance\r\nof regional and international cooperation in carrying out the\r\nwork of the Agency pursuant to its statute, in promoting the\r\nuse of nuclear energy and the application of the necessary\r\nmeasures to strengthen further the safety of nuclear\r\ninstallations and to minimize risks to life, health and\r\nenvironment, and in ensuring the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of the safeguards system of the Agency.\r\nMr. Adekanye (Nigeria): On behalf of the\r\nDelegation of Nigeria, I wish to express our appreciation\r\nto Mr. Hans Blix, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his statement\r\nhighlighting the activities of the Agency in the past year.\r\nNigeria has followed with interest those activities as\r\nenumerated in the annual report (GC(39)/3) and notes the\r\nprogress made in pursuit of the goals and objectives of\r\nthe Agency. Those achievements reflect the widespread\r\nsupport of the international community as a whole for the\r\nAgency in a changing world, which would require of the\r\nsecretariat of the Agency continuing commitment and of\r\nits member States stronger political resolve to make the\r\nAgency truly serve the cause of peace and development.\r\nOne of the major challenges for the Agency today is\r\nthe expansion of its contribution to global solutions to the\r\nproblems of poverty and underdevelopment in our world.\r\nAs the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria stated in\r\nhis address at the Special Commemorative Meeting for\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations:\r\n“Development is a question of the human condition,\r\nand for many countries it is indeed a question of\r\nsurvival.” (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 38th meeting,\r\np. 24)\r\nThe Agency’s research and technical cooperation\r\nactivities, aimed at assisting member States to achieve\r\nself-reliance in nuclear science and technology, would\r\ntherefore contribute to the focus on development.\r\nIt is reassuring that the Agency’s 1995-1996\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme, approved by the\r\nBoard of Governors in 1994, included 11 new model\r\nprojects formulated to address the national priorities of\r\nrecipient States in the areas covered by the Agency’s\r\nresearch efforts at its Seibersdorf laboratory. The\r\nincorporation in the Technical Cooperation Programme of\r\nthe conclusions of the Third Review Seminar endorsing\r\nthe model project concept, more end-use orientation and\r\na broad human-needs approach to transfer of nuclear\r\ntechnology is a manifestation of the Agency’s capacity to\r\nadapt its machinery and policies to meet the needs of its\r\nmembers.\r\nThis new partnership with recipient countries, based\r\non productive dialogue and exploiting the new country\r\nprogramme framework in the design of projects by\r\nmember States, should be vigorously pursued even as the\r\nmodel project concept is extended to many more\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\ndeveloping countries. We believe that this would enhance\r\nthe impact of projects and increase public awareness of the\r\nbenefits of non-military applications of nuclear energy. In\r\nthe same vein, the delegation of Nigeria welcomes the new\r\ninitiatives to use the institutions of developing countries,\r\nconsidered centres of excellence, in the implementation of\r\nselected technical cooperation projects. The primary goal\r\nshould remain the strengthening of member States’\r\ncapacity, regional development and cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries themselves.\r\nThe cooperation of member States in providing the\r\nAgency the wherewithal to implement identified projects is\r\nessential to the future of the new, better-focused Technical\r\nCooperation Programme. Undoubtedly, the agreement\r\nreached among member States at last September’s General\r\nConference on new levels of funding for the Programme\r\nunder the Technical Assistance and Cooperation Fund for\r\nthe 1996-1998 period represents an important signal of that\r\ncooperation. However, that decision can only have the\r\ndesired practical effect on the Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation activities if it is backed by a firm commitment\r\nto provide the requisite resources.\r\nSuch support is particularly essential to the countries\r\nin the African region which cooperate under the aegis of\r\nthe African Regional Cooperative Agreement (AFRA) as a\r\nvehicle for the transfer of nuclear technology through\r\nrelevant region-wide projects. Nigeria’s decision to agree to\r\nan extension of that Agreement for another five-year period\r\nis an affirmation of our country’s continuing commitment\r\nto regional cooperation and of the important contribution of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency to that process.\r\nWe believe that such cooperation will be further enhanced\r\nwhen the 7th meeting of AFRA is hosted by Nigeria next\r\nyear. Simultaneously, we in Nigeria are determined to\r\nexpand technical cooperation and have taken steps to\r\nstrengthen the regulatory and institutional framework.\r\nNigeria reposes great faith in the Agency’s safeguards\r\nsystem and has therefore always placed a high premium on\r\nits efficiency and effectiveness in strengthening confidence\r\nand trust in the non-proliferation regime. A credible, non-\r\ndiscriminatory verification system, implemented with vigour\r\nand professionalism, is invaluable to the peace and security\r\nof our world. The increase in the past year in the number\r\nof safeguards agreements in force in member States, as well\r\nas the high degree of compliance with the spirit and letter\r\nof these agreements, reflect positively on the safeguards\r\nsystem. Its integrity and continuing efficacy require not\r\nsolely an assertion of the Agency’s rights under safeguards\r\nagreements, as variously affirmed by the Board of\r\nGovernors in the recent past, but also maximum\r\ncooperation from member States and the parties to those\r\nagreements in facilitating the work of Agency inspectors,\r\nincluding access to relevant data, sites and facilities.\r\nThat cooperation has contributed to the General\r\nConference’s approval of the first part of the new\r\nsafeguards approaches under the so-called Programme\r\n“93+2”, as well as the agreement on a new funding\r\nformula covering the next five years. We trust that\r\nmember States will maintain the current momentum for\r\nreform and improvement so as to retain the confidence of\r\nthe international community in the safeguards system as\r\na whole. Moreover, this would justify the Agency’s\r\nassumption of additional safeguards duties under future\r\nverification agreements, including a new comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty and a new fissile material cut-off\r\nconvention.\r\nFor the countries in the Africa region, whose firm\r\ncommitment to non-proliferation is now reflected in the\r\ntreaty on the African nuclear-weapon-free zone endorsed\r\nby the Organization of African Unity Council of Ministers\r\nin June 1995, the Agency’s role in verifying treaty\r\nundertakings will be invaluable.\r\nThe contribution of the Agency towards the\r\ndevelopment of a culture of safety in the nuclear industry\r\nworld-wide and the strengthening of institutional\r\nmechanisms towards that end provide another basis for\r\nmy country’s confidence in the organization. We note that\r\nmember States have continued to grapple with the issue\r\nof establishing an international regime on liability for\r\nnuclear damage as a complement to the Convention on\r\nNuclear Safety adopted last year. Together with the\r\nproposed convention on the safety of radioactive waste\r\nmanagement, that agreement should create a strong legal\r\nframework for nuclear safety.\r\nHowever, the international community’s\r\ndetermination to confront the new menace of illicit\r\ntrafficking in nuclear material, on which the Agency is\r\nnow developing a valuable database, should not distract\r\nattention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance\r\nover the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly\r\ntoxic substances in the territories of developing countries.\r\nWe should continue to require the effective\r\nimplementation of the IAEA Code of Practice on\r\nInternational Transboundary Movement of Radioactive\r\nWaste to strengthen further international cooperation in\r\nthis important area.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nFinally, it has always been the view of my country\r\nthat the Agency needs to increase representation of its\r\nmember States on the Board of Governors, as part of the\r\nprocess of reform and democratization. Such a reform, in\r\nour view, should be based on the principles of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution, transparency, accountability,\r\neffectiveness and efficiency. In particular, it should address\r\nthe current underrepresentation of Africa and the Middle\r\nEast and South Asia. We urge Member States not to let slip\r\nthe opportunity to make the Board of Governors truly\r\nresponsive to the interests of developing and developed\r\ncountries as the Agency confronts the challenges of the next\r\nmillennium.\r\nMr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): First of all, the Russian delegation, like other\r\ndelegations, expresses its gratitude to the Director General\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\r\nMr. Hans Blix, for the submission of the report of the\r\nAgency, which provides a broad and varied picture of the\r\nactivity of the IAEA.\r\nDuring the past year, events of truly historic\r\nsignificance have been the adoption by consensus, at the\r\nReview and Extension Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\r\nof a decision on an indefinite extension of that Treaty\r\nwithout any conditions whatever. By making this a standing\r\nTreaty, in the interest of further consolidation of the\r\ninternational non-proliferation regime, the participants in the\r\nConference demonstrated a great sense of responsibility for\r\nthe destiny of the world, international stability and nuclear\r\ndisarmament. The Russian Federation intends to make all\r\npossible efforts to implement the decisions adopted by the\r\nNPT Conference.\r\nThe Conference emphasized the significance of the\r\nrole of the IAEA in ensuring the effectiveness of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the\r\nefforts it has been exerting to improve the safeguards\r\nsystem. The Conference devoted intense attention to the\r\nmost urgent problems in the disarmament field. We note\r\nthat the nuclear arms race has been stopped and reversed,\r\nand in 1991 an entire class of nuclear weapons of Russia\r\nand the United States were eliminated — more than 2,500\r\nmedium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. The START I\r\nTreaty, which entered into force in December 1994,\r\ndecreases by nearly half two major nuclear arsenals. Next\r\nwe have the forthcoming ratification of the START II\r\nTreaty, and in its framework Russia and the United States\r\nwill reduce their strategic offensive weapons to one third.\r\nRussia has consistently favoured the drawing up\r\nspeedily, and no later than 1996, at the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, of a non-discriminatory comprehensive\r\nnuclear test-ban treaty, subject to effective international\r\nverification. Such a treaty will strengthen the nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime and will prevent its qualitative further\r\ndevelopment. It should also be emphasized that the new,\r\ndemocratic Russia has not carried out a single nuclear\r\nexplosion and has firmly abided by the moratorium it has\r\ndeclared.\r\nRussia reaffirms its dedication to the drawing up at\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament of a multilateral, non-\r\ndiscriminatory and verifiable convention banning the\r\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. This\r\nwould be an important contribution to the strengthening\r\nof the non-proliferation regime.\r\nAn initiative put forward by the President of Russia,\r\nMr. Yeltsin, has received broad international backing —\r\nthat is, the initiative on the holding in the spring of 1996\r\nof a summit meeting on issues of nuclear security, to\r\nconsider pressing problems in this area and define ways\r\nto solve them, in both the short and the long term. Such\r\nproblems include ensuring the safe development of\r\nnuclear energy throughout the world and the dumping of\r\nradioactive wastes, international safeguards, and the use\r\nof nuclear materials released during the process of the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. In our view the IAEA\r\ncould make a significant contribution to the preparations\r\nfor such a meeting.\r\nWe continue to support the multifaceted activity of\r\nthe Agency in such areas as halting illicit trafficking in\r\nnuclear materials, enhancing the level of their physical\r\nprotection, and preparing an international convention to\r\ndeal with radioactive wastes. A clear example of effective\r\ncooperation within the framework of the IAEA is the\r\nsuccess of the international seminar held in May by the\r\nAgency, on the initiative of the Northern countries, on\r\nenhancing reliability and security in dealing with\r\nradioactive wastes.\r\nRussia has unswervingly given priority to one of the\r\nmajor areas of the work of the Agency: control over the\r\npeaceful use of atomic energy and constant enhancement\r\nof the IAEA safeguards system. We note with satisfaction\r\nthat the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties\r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons had a positive view of the Agency’s activity in\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the safeguards system.\r\nRussia will continue to cooperate closely with the Agency\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nand will render its assistance in this work within the\r\nframework of the national Russian programme of support\r\nfor the IAEA safeguards.\r\nAttaching great significance to the activities of the\r\nIAEA and the development of scientific and technical\r\ncooperation between Member States, our country actively\r\nsupports those programmes in which all countries are\r\ninterested. Among such programmes highest priority should\r\nbe given here to present and future technology for nuclear\r\nenergy and its fuel cycle. The development of programmes\r\nto produce and promote new nuclear technologies and a\r\nnew generation of reactors, which are promising from the\r\npoint of view of security, ecology, economics and non-\r\nproliferation, must be one of the most important areas of\r\nthe Agency’s activity. It would be useful to begin the\r\ndrafting of a comprehensive international programme for\r\nthe development of nuclear energy, as a basis for solving\r\nenergy, ecological and economic problems.\r\nWe attach great importance to the Agency’s activities\r\nin rendering technical assistance to the developing\r\ncountries. Despite the economic difficulties it has\r\nexperienced, the Russian Government has found it possible\r\nto allocate to the Technical Assistance and Cooperation\r\nFund in 1995 the sum of 5.7 billion roubles. These means\r\nare earmarked for supplying developing countries members\r\nof the Agency with Russian equipment, apparatus and\r\nfacilities and also for organizing training courses and other\r\nactivities in Russia.\r\nWe also support the Agency’s activity in improving\r\nthe security of existing nuclear power stations in the\r\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe, and in the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). A source of\r\nsatisfaction is the work of the secretariat of the IAEA in\r\nimplementing that programme. An analysis of the safety of\r\nsuch nuclear power stations has been successfully carried\r\nout and intensive work lies ahead to eliminate the problems\r\nwhich have come to light.\r\nOf course economic difficulties are slowing down the\r\nrate of implementation of these programmes. Our country\r\nfavours a broad international exchange of experience and\r\nachievements in the area of the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy. Today more than 30 countries are Russia’s partners,\r\nand it is cooperating with them on the basis of more than\r\n100 intergovernmental and inter-Agency agreements in\r\nforce.\r\nThe most important activity of Russia’s nuclear\r\ncomplex at the present stage is the problem of the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. The developing process\r\nof the reduction of nuclear weapons inevitably has\r\nrequired a transformation to peaceful areas of a significant\r\npart of the scientific, technical defence potential. An\r\nimportant step aimed at ensuring the viability of defence\r\nenterprises and their conversion and the retraining of\r\nexperts is the establishment of the International Scientific\r\nTechnical Centre in Moscow through the efforts of\r\nRussia, the United States, Japan and the European Union.\r\nThe Russian delegation associates itself with the co-\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution in document A/50/L.11 on\r\nthe report of the IAEA for 1994.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): It is regrettable to note that the report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) makes\r\nreference once again to the so-called nuclear issue on the\r\nKorean Peninsula in a biased, subjective and unjustified\r\nmanner, disregarding the reality.\r\nAs we have clarified our position repeatedly on the\r\nso-called nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, it is not\r\na matter to be considered at the United Nations either in\r\nregard to its substance or in the light of its character, but\r\nis a serious political and military issue to be settled\r\nbilaterally between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the unjust discussions of\r\nthe so-called nuclear issue held in the past at the United\r\nNations have never facilitated its resolution but, on the\r\ncontrary, have introduced complexity and obstacles into\r\nthe process of resolving the issue.\r\nRecently, the so-called nuclear issue is being\r\nefficiently resolved between the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States in accordance\r\nwith the DPRK-US Agreed Framework of October 1994.\r\nIt has been stipulated in the DPRK-US Agreed\r\nFramework that the United States should provide the light\r\nwater reactor project in return for the DPRK’s freeze of\r\nnuclear facilities, and the DPRK is to implement the\r\nsafeguards agreement only when provision of the light\r\nwater reactors is complete.\r\nAccordingly, the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea has frozen the nuclear facilities and also stopped\r\nthe construction of 50 megawatt and 200 megawatt\r\nreactors, subject to the Agreed Framework.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nAlong with this, the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea accepted the 10 additional inspector designations and\r\ntheir continuous presence in the country as suggested by the\r\nIAEA, thus ensuring the monitoring of nuclear facilities\r\ncovered by the freeze. The Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea also permitted verification activities of the IAEA\r\nsuch as containment and surveillance measures which the\r\nAgency needs to carry out so as to verify the freeze.\r\nThis clearly indicates that the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea fully implements the DPRK-US Agreed\r\nFramework, which in fact goes far beyond the obligations\r\nunder the safeguards agreement to be fulfilled by the\r\nDPRK, which has a special status under the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nThere will be no complicated problems that cannot be\r\nresolved smoothly if all international commitments are\r\nimplemented as sincerely as the DPRK has implemented its\r\ncommitments.\r\nAt the talks held last June in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,\r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and\r\nthe United States with respect to the implementation of the\r\nDPRK-US Agreed Framework, the United States reaffirmed\r\nits commitments to take full responsibility for providing the\r\nDPRK with the light water reactors on a turnkey basis and\r\ninterim energy alternatives in return for the DPRK’s freeze\r\nof nuclear facilities.\r\nThe working negotiations between the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Korean Peninsula\r\nEnergy Development Organization (KEDO) relating to the\r\nprovision of the light water reactors are now actively under\r\nway.\r\nDespite positive developments towards a final\r\nresolution of the so-called nuclear issue, certain member\r\nStates and officials of the IAEA secretariat are still\r\nresorting to meaningless argument about this so-called\r\nnuclear issue of ours. Indeed they are attempting, in a\r\ndisguised manner, to use the so-called nuclear issue to\r\ncreate an atmosphere of pressure against the DPRK,\r\ndeliberately turning their faces away from the reality that\r\nthe issue is being resolved smoothly.\r\nWe are very concerned that these kinds of unjust acts\r\nby certain forces hostile to us could cast a dark shadow\r\nover the ongoing negotiations between the DPRK and\r\nKEDO. As has been proved by the whole process of\r\nresolving the so-called nuclear issue between the DPRK and\r\nthe United States, no issue can be resolved if one side puts\r\npressure on the other. Fear of pressure exerted against us\r\nhas never made us give up doing what we are supposed\r\nto do.\r\nComplete implementation of the DPRK-US Agreed\r\nFramework is a precondition for the implementation of\r\nthe safeguards agreement. Therefore, urging the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to comply with\r\nthe safeguards agreement at this stage, in total disregard\r\nof the reality, will only reveal the true colour of\r\ncamouflaged attempts by certain forces to abuse the so-\r\ncalled nuclear issue in order to realize their political\r\npurposes.\r\nWe hope that the people of the world will have a\r\ncorrect understanding of the nuclear issue on the Korean\r\nPeninsula and will contribute to the implementation of the\r\nDPRK-US Agreed Framework, which will eventually lead\r\nto the final resolution of the nuclear issue.\r\nMr. de Icaza (Mexico) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation has listened with close attention\r\nto the report presented by Mr. Hans Blix, Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), on the activities of the Agency for the year 1994.\r\nThe detailed information on the activities carried out over\r\nthe past year are an indication of the praiseworthy\r\nleadership of the Agency by its Director General, and we\r\nextend to him once again our gratitude and\r\ncongratulations and reiterate our firm support.\r\nMy country has always supported the Agency’s\r\nwork to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear power as a\r\nway of achieving cooperation for economic and social\r\ndevelopment of countries. Similarly, we recognize the\r\nimportance of improving programmes for the protection\r\nand safety of nuclear facilities — a fundamental element\r\nin assuring non-proliferation.\r\nThe report presented today contains a detailed\r\naccount of the activities of the Agency in different fields.\r\nHowever, we have noted that, as in previous years, a\r\nmarked priority would seem to be given to the application\r\nof safeguards and verification, to the detriment of\r\ncooperation and technical assistance activities. The desire\r\nto strengthen the effectiveness and to expand the\r\nsafeguards system should not relegate these activities to\r\na secondary role.\r\nWe consider that international cooperation for the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear power and technologies continues\r\nto be the principal objective of the Agency. A better\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nbalance in its activities is indispensable today, in the face\r\nof the urgent needs of a majority of the developing\r\ncountries in such varied areas as energy, human health, the\r\nenvironment and agriculture.\r\nThis year, with the signature of the Treaty for the\r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, known as the Tlatelolco Treaty, by the\r\nGovernment of Cuba, the full accession of Saint Lucia, and\r\nratification by Saint Kitts and Nevis the international non-\r\nproliferation regime has been strengthened, thus\r\nconsolidating the intention of my country and other\r\ncountries of the region to make Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean the first region of the world free of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nMexico hopes that all Member States will fulfil their\r\nobligations emanating from the United Nations Charter, the\r\nstatute of the IAEA and the agreements arising therefrom.\r\nThus, my country was among those that signed the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety when it was opened for\r\nsignature, and is on the point of concluding the internal\r\nprocess leading to ratification.\r\nIn this forum, we would like to appeal to countries to\r\nsign and ratify this international juridical instrument, the\r\nfull entry into force of which will guarantee the trustworthy\r\nuse of nuclear power. Similarly, we consider that exchanges\r\nof equipment and nuclear material should be the subject of\r\nnegotiations within the framework of the Agency, with a\r\nview to ensuring that the commitments entered into are duly\r\nreflected in international instruments with clear-cut and\r\nprecise rules.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the beginning of preparations\r\nin the Agency for the development of a convention on the\r\nmanagement of radioactive wastes, and the establishment of\r\na Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and\r\nCooperation to advise the Director General of the IAEA on\r\ntechnical cooperation policy and on measures to strengthen\r\nthe efficiency of the Agency’s programme.\r\nMy delegation is firmly convinced that for the binding,\r\nuniversal and non-discriminatory nature of the measures\r\ncontemplated in the so-called Programme “93+2” to\r\nconstitute a fundamental prerequisite in the success of this\r\nprocess, we need to define the terms and scope of the\r\nAgency’s cooperation in this matter. In this context, my\r\nGovernment wishes to express its support for the decision\r\nadopted by the Board of Governors last June in approving\r\nthe application of measures for the execution of which the\r\nAgency enjoys sufficient legal authority, emanating from\r\nthe safeguards agreements, in order to put them into\r\npractice. We hope for an early definition of the necessary\r\nmachinery to put into effect those measures for which the\r\nAgency requires additional authority.\r\nFor the Board of Governors to be really effective\r\nand representative, it should reflect the level of\r\ndevelopment achieved by member States in the nuclear\r\narea, and the increase in the number of members of the\r\nAgency as a consequence of political changes across the\r\nworld and the emergence of new countries, particularly in\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe. A more transparent process\r\nfor the appointment of member States to the Board is\r\nessential.\r\nAnother question which we believe to be important\r\nis the careful examination by the IAEA of the possible\r\nverification functions that it could develop in the area of\r\ndisarmament — particularly as we are now beginning to\r\nsee significant advances towards the prompt conclusion of\r\na comprehensive test-ban treaty. Negotiations are starting,\r\nwith a view to an agreement on the prohibition of the\r\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Full\r\nadvantage should of course be taken of the long\r\nexperience and recognized competence of the Agency so\r\nably led by Mr. Hans Blix.\r\nMs. Diseko (South Africa): My delegation, as a\r\nco-sponsor of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/50/L.11, would like to urge its adoption.\r\nAt the landmark NPT Review and Extension\r\nConference in New York earlier this year, the review\r\nprocess for the Treaty was strengthened, and a set of\r\nprinciples and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament was adopted by consensus. This led to a\r\nconsensus on the indefinite extension of the NPT. South\r\nAfrica, having rolled back its own nuclear-weapons\r\nprogramme, was keen to ensure that the Treaty was\r\nstrengthened for the benefit of all humanity so as to\r\nadvance to a nuclear-weapon-free world. We regard the\r\nrole of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nin verifying and assessing compliance with safeguards\r\nagreements as a vital component of the success of the\r\nTreaty.\r\nFlowing logically from the NPT Conference will be\r\na comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty (CTBT), with\r\n1996 as the target date for its conclusion. The NPT\r\nConference, after extensive consultations, including\r\nconsultations with the nuclear-weapon States, called on all\r\nthe parties concerned to exercise “utmost restraint”,\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\npending the entry into force of a CTBT. My Government,\r\ntherefore, strongly supported and co-sponsored a resolution\r\nat the IAEA General Conference in September which\r\nexpressed grave concern at the resumption and continuation\r\nof nuclear testing by certain countries. I would like to\r\nrepeat that concern here today, and call on the parties\r\ninvolved to cease nuclear testing immediately.\r\nAs the Assembly will be aware, South Africa is once\r\nagain the designated member for Africa on the Board of\r\nGovernors of the IAEA, after an absence of 17 years, and\r\nwe are looking forward to playing an active role in the\r\nwork of this important Agency. My delegation would like\r\nto commend the work of the Director General and the\r\nIAEA over the past year, as reflected in the report before\r\nus today.\r\nIn particular, we fully support the programme to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of\r\nthe safeguards system. Given developments in Iraq, in\r\nparticular over the past year, it has become only too\r\napparent that strengthening of the safeguards system is\r\nessential if similar situations are to be avoided in future and\r\nthe objectives of non-proliferation achieved.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to emphasize our desire that\r\nthe Agency continue to devote all available resources to the\r\nprovision of technical assistance to the developing world,\r\nthereby bringing the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy and technology to all nations. It is vital that this role\r\nbe perceived by all as being of equal importance to the\r\nAgency as its safeguards role. We in South Africa are\r\nhoping to play a useful role in ensuring that this objective\r\nis met.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Iraq to introduce the amendment to draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.11 contained in document A/50/L.12.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq): It is my pleasure to introduce my\r\ndelegation’s amendment, circulated in document A/50/L.12,\r\nto the draft resolution entitled “Report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency” (A/50/L.11).\r\nFirst of all, I should like to reiterate our position on\r\nthe draft resolutions that have been presented under this\r\nitem. My delegation thinks — and many delegations share\r\nour view — that draft resolutions under this item should\r\navoid controversial political issues and assessments.\r\nUnfortunately, this has not been the case in the last few\r\nyears, and in particular it is not the case with the draft\r\nresolution presented this year.\r\nConcerning operative paragraph 7 of the draft\r\nresolution, which deals with Iraq’s implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) and 715 (1991),\r\nmy delegation considers that this paragraph does not\r\nreflect in a fair and objective manner the cooperative\r\nrelationship between Iraq and the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), or the real stage of advancement\r\nof the IAEA’s work under relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. We are aware of the fact that political\r\nmotivations are behind this attempt. The first of these is\r\nto prolong the comprehensive regime of sanctions\r\nimposed on my country, if not to change it to an open-\r\nended one.\r\nOur first amendment to this paragraph refers to the\r\nIAEA’s assessment of the advancement of its work. The\r\namendment puts the question of the information provided\r\nby Iraq this year in its real and exact context. This means,\r\nas has been stated in the IAEA’s report to the Security\r\nCouncil, that this information did not change the IAEA’s\r\nconclusion that Iraq’s nuclear-weapon programme has\r\nbeen, for all practical purposes, destroyed, removed or\r\nrendered harmless. Furthermore, this morning Mr. Hans\r\nBlix, the Director General of the IAEA, in his address to\r\nthis Assembly, reiterated this fact, saying:\r\n“As I reported to the General Assembly last year, it\r\nis our conclusion that the essential components of\r\nIraq’s clandestine nuclear-weapon programme have\r\nbeen identified and destroyed, removed or rendered\r\nharmless”. (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n46th meeting, p. 4).\r\nMr. Blix added that\r\n“This assessment was not based on faith in Iraqi\r\nstatements, but on data gathered during inspection,\r\non information provided by the suppliers and\r\nMember States and, to a great extent, on analysis of\r\nthe large number of original documents which were\r\nobtained in Iraq early in the inspection process”.\r\n(ibid., p. 4).\r\nFurthermore, it is worth mentioning in this context\r\nthat the report of the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations entitled “Verification in all its aspects”\r\n(A/50/377) stated in the paragraph on the experience of\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and\r\nthe IAEA in Iraq, that\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\n“withholding of some of the data by Iraq was\r\novercome, in large part, by the extraordinary\r\ninspection rights of UNSCOM and the IAEA on a\r\nshort- or no-notice basis”. (A/50/377, para. 197).\r\nBased on these facts and assessments, it is clear that\r\nthe exaggerations about the issue of information are not\r\nlogical, fair or factual and should not be taken out of\r\ncontext — as has happened in the draft resolution —\r\nbearing in mind that Iraq provided all the information\r\nneeded by the IAEA and expresses willingness to provide\r\nfurther details needed by the IAEA.\r\nFor these reasons, my delegation has presented our\r\namendment — a paragraph from the IAEA’s report to the\r\nSecurity Council — in order to introduce balance into\r\noperative paragraph 7.\r\nOur second amendment would replace the words\r\n“stresses the need for Iraq to cooperate fully with the\r\nAgency” with the words “stresses the need for Iraq to\r\ncontinue its cooperation with the Agency”. I should like to\r\nremind representatives that Iraq proposed the same\r\namendment last year, and it was adopted by a vote in this\r\nAssembly. My delegation expresses its deep regret that\r\nsome of the sponsors of the draft resolution did not take\r\ninto consideration the will of the General Assembly in this\r\nmatter. Nevertheless, my delegation noted with satisfaction\r\nthe statement made this morning by His Excellency the\r\nAmbassador of Spain on behalf of the European Union. He\r\nsaid that\r\n“long-term success can be ensured only if Iraq\r\ncontinues to cooperate fully with the IAEA” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 46th meeting, p. 10).\r\nI should like on this occasion to reiterate our\r\ncommitment to continue our cooperation with the IAEA in\r\nthe fulfilment of its mandate.\r\nFinally, my delegation hopes that the Assembly will\r\nconsider positively our factual and fair amendment.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI should like to announce that the following countries\r\nhave become co-sponsors of draft resolution A/50/L.11: El\r\nSalvador, Latvia and the Russian Federation.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.11 and the amendments thereto contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.12.\r\nI shall now call on representatives who wish to make\r\nstatements in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe penultimate preambular paragraph of draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.11 contains a reference to the resolution\r\nGC(39)/RES/23, which was adopted on 22 September\r\n1995 by the General Conference of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and which deals with\r\nnuclear testing.\r\nWhen that text was adopted at Vienna the French\r\ndelegation pointed out that it did not feel it could\r\nassociate itself with the statements or judgements\r\ncontained in the resolution, above and beyond the\r\nproblem of the competence of the General Conference.\r\nFor that reason the French delegation will abstain in the\r\nvoting on the penultimate preambular paragraph of the\r\ndraft resolution. This is also why, this year, France has\r\nnot been a sponsor of the draft resolution.\r\nIn this connection, however, the French delegation\r\nwishes to reaffirm in forceful terms its full support for the\r\naction of the International Atomic Energy Agency and for\r\nits Director General, Mr. Blix.\r\nMr. Kumar (India): As a member of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) since its\r\ninception in 1957, India has consistently attached the\r\nhighest importance to its objectives. We actively\r\nparticipate in the activities of the Agency. Since draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.11 pertains to the activities of the IAEA\r\nas a whole, to which we attach great value, we would go\r\nalong with the draft resolution. However, we have\r\nconsiderable difficulty with the fourth preambular\r\nparagraph.\r\nThe language of the fourth preambular paragraph of\r\nthe draft resolution indicates a linkage between adherence\r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and the freedom to develop research,\r\nproduction and use of nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes. I quote article II of the IAEA statute, which\r\nreads:\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\n“The Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge\r\nthe contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and\r\nprosperity throughout the world. It shall ensure, so far\r\nas it is able, that assistance provided by it or at its\r\nrequest or under its supervision or control is not used\r\nin such a way as to further any military purpose.”\r\nFurthermore, article IV C states:\r\n“The Agency is based on the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of all its members ...”.\r\nThe purpose of these articles in the IAEA statute is\r\nobviously to encourage unfettered access by member States\r\nto the peaceful uses of nuclear energy without any\r\ndiscrimination whatsoever, since any perceived\r\ndiscrimination will have an inevitable consequence on the\r\nresponse of member States to their obligations to the\r\nAgency. The NPT is a separate instrument and cannot be\r\nused to create a differential between members of the\r\nAgency.\r\nBy inferring that adherence to the NPT, on which my\r\nGovernment’s views are well known, has a bearing on\r\naccess to peaceful uses of atomic energy, the draft\r\nresolution deviates from the objectives enshrined in the\r\nstatute.\r\nWe have, therefore, been constrained to call for a\r\nseparate vote on the fourth preambular paragraph.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a\r\npolitical and military one, in terms of its origin and nature,\r\nwhich can be resolved only by the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States. In the past, the\r\nUnited Nations and the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) have handled the issue unreasonably,\r\nhindering rather than helping its settlement.\r\nThe draft resolution before us, sponsored by certain\r\ncountries, again refers to us unfairly. The sponsors of the\r\ndraft resolution have attempted to turn their faces away\r\nfrom the realities by urging us to comply with the\r\nsafeguards agreement, and by trying to disregard the\r\nDPRK-US Agreed Framework. How could we fully comply\r\nwith the safeguards agreement when the DPRK-US Agreed\r\nFramework has not been implemented?\r\nThe DPRK-US Agreed Framework stipulates the\r\nobligations to be carried out by the DPRK and the United\r\nStates, respectively, for the final resolution of the nuclear\r\nissue. It especially identifies the stage at which the DPRK\r\nshould comply fully with the safeguards agreement.\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.11 reveals the ulterior\r\nintentions of certain co-sponsors to abuse the name of the\r\nUnited Nations as a means of pressure on us. They should\r\nbear in mind that the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea is a dignified country that regards independence as\r\nits life, and any attempt whatsoever to put pressure upon\r\nus is completely unacceptable.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea strongly rejects draft resolution A/50/L.11 as an\r\nattempt of indecent forces to create an atmosphere\r\nunfavourable to us and to dilute the significance of the\r\nDPRK-US Agreed Framework in order to lay obstacles in\r\nthe way of a resolution of the nuclear issues on the\r\nKorean Peninsula.\r\nActually, the draft resolution gives us the impression\r\nthat the United Nations Security Council and the IAEA\r\nare opposed to the DPRK-US Agreed Framework.\r\nTherefore, the delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea will vote against draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.11.\r\nMr. Kirkland (United States of America): The Iraqi\r\namendment, particularly the second part of it, attempts to\r\nturn around completely the facts about Iraq’s programme.\r\nLast year, the report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) on Iraq’s nuclear programme did speak\r\nabout Iraq’s cooperation in one particular area, the\r\nestablishment of the monitoring programme. This year,\r\nthe words “cooperation” and “cooperate” do not appear a\r\nsingle time in the IAEA report. The reason why should be\r\nobvious. Iraq has been forced to admit that it concealed\r\nhuge amounts of information, including the fact that it\r\nhad repeatedly violated Security Council resolutions, and\r\nit is continuing this concealment today. Iraq is not\r\n“cooperating”, and thus it is not “continuing to\r\ncooperate,” and to include such a phrase in the draft\r\nresolution would be simply contrary to fact.\r\nThe first part of the amendment selects the only\r\npassage from the IAEA report which is not completely\r\nnegative about Iraq. This selection does not serve the\r\ntruth. It is not new news, and it is not acceptable to the\r\nco-sponsors.\r\nWe urge all delegations to vote against this\r\namendment and to support the draft resolution as it\r\nstands.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.11 and on the amendment thereto\r\ncontained in document A/50/L.12.\r\nIn accordance with rule 90 of the rules of procedure,\r\nthe amendment is voted on first. The Assembly will\r\ntherefore take a decision first on the amendment circulated\r\nin document A/50/L.12.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cuba, Indonesia, Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, Lesotho, Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Malaysia, Sudan\r\nAgainst:\r\nAlbania, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria,\r\nBahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Bhutan,\r\nBolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria,\r\nBurkina Faso, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica,\r\nCroatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador,\r\nEl Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia,\r\nGermany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti,\r\nHonduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\r\nJamaica, Japan, Kazakstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Maldives,\r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Micronesia\r\n(Federated States of), Monaco, Mongolia, Netherlands,\r\nNew Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Panama,\r\nPapua New Guinea, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Republic\r\nof Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Rwanda,\r\nSaint Lucia, Samoa, San Marino, Senegal, Singapore,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa,\r\nSpain, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, United States of America, Uruguay,\r\nVenezuela, Zambia\r\nAbstaining:\r\nBangladesh, Botswana, Burundi, Colombia,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India,\r\nMauritius, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan,\r\nPhilippines, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Thailand,\r\nUganda, Ukraine, United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nZimbabwe\r\nThe amendment was rejected by 95 votes to 8, with\r\n22 abstentions.\r\nThe Acting President: the Assembly will now turn\r\nto draft resolution A/50/L.11.\r\nSeparate votes have been requested on the fourth and\r\neleventh preambular paragraphs and on operative\r\nparagraph 7.\r\nIs there any objection to those requests?\r\nSince there is none, I shall put those paragraphs to\r\nthe vote separately.\r\nI put to the vote first the fourth preambular\r\nparagraph of draft resolution A/50/L.11.

A/50/L.11 as a whole was adopted\r\nby 144 votes to 1, with 8 abstentions (resolution\r\n50/9).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Dominica and the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania advised the Secretariat\r\nthat they intended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to explain their votes.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Wu Chengjiang (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The Chinese delegation abstained in the voting\r\non draft resolution A/50/L.11, on the report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China is of\r\nthe view that the General Assembly’s draft resolution on\r\nthe report of the IAEA should not include negative\r\nreferences to specific countries, for such a pressure tactic\r\nwill not only fail to contribute to the solution of problems\r\nbut may also complicate matters even further. The\r\nChinese delegation has reservations on some of the\r\nresolutions of the Board of Governors and of the General\r\nConference of the IAEA that are mentioned in the draft\r\nresolution. For these reasons the Chinese delegation\r\nabstained in the voting on the draft resolution.\r\nThis, however, is without prejudice to China’s views\r\non the Agency’s activities. In his statement this morning\r\nthe Chinese representative offered a comprehensive and\r\npositive assessment of the Agency’s work in the year\r\nunder review.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq): My delegation lost its right to vote\r\nin the General Assembly for reasons beyond its control —\r\nnamely, the comprehensive embargo imposed by Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and the freezing of its assets abroad.\r\nHowever, if we did have the right to vote, my\r\ndelegation would have abstained in the voting on operative\r\nparagraph 7 and on the draft resolution as a whole.\r\nMr. Serme (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The delegation of Burkina Faso voted against the\r\namendment to draft resolution A/50/L.11 submitted by Iraq\r\nand contained in document A/50/L.12. Our delegation\r\nwishes to stress that if there had been a separate vote on\r\neach of the two paragraphs of the amendment, it would\r\nhave voted in favour of paragraph (a) because of its factual\r\nnature. That paragraph reproduces the terms of the\r\nAgency’s report submitted to the Security Council on 6\r\nOctober 1995 and is also in keeping with the conclusions\r\ndescribed by the Director General of the Agency in his\r\npresentation of the report this morning. My delegation\r\nwould have voted against paragraph (b) of the proposed\r\namendment because the original version reproduced the\r\nterms of the resolution referred to in paragraph 7 of the\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nMr. Yativ (Israel): Israel supported the draft\r\nresolution as a whole. However, it is our firm position that\r\nthe application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes\r\nshould be conducted, as prescribed by the Agency’s statute,\r\non a basis of equality, regardless of whether or not a State\r\nmember of the Agency is a State party to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Therefore,\r\nIsrael opposed the fourth preambular paragraph of the draft\r\nresolution and voted against it.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nmake statements in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in the exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): This morning the South Korean representative\r\nspoke about our “non-compliance” with the safeguards\r\nagreement, and he also defined the DPRK-US Agreed\r\nFramework as a complementary device to induce us to\r\ncomply with the safeguards agreement. Unless it is South\r\nKorea’s ulterior intention to impede the implementation\r\nof the Agreed Framework, I think he may be ignorant of\r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. I therefore\r\nthink it useful to take this opportunity to educate him on\r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\r\nThe DPRK-US Agreed Framework, which was\r\nwelcomed by the Security Council and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), clearly stipulates the\r\nobligations to be implemented by the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States, respectively,\r\nand identifies explicitly a certain stage at which the\r\nDPRK is to cooperate fully with the IAEA. The DPRK-\r\nUS Agreed Framework is for the final resolution of the\r\nnuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\r\nI advise the representative of South Korea to read\r\ncarefully the statement made this morning by the\r\nrepresentative of the United States. We are not fools to be\r\ninduced into something by false documents — if that is\r\nwhat the Agreed Framework is. We therefore suspect that\r\nthe representative of South Korea may be an ignorant\r\nperson who cannot even understand clearly the Agreed\r\nFramework, one of the important international documents\r\nof our times.\r\nOnly today South Korea revealed its sinister\r\nintention to lay obstacles in the path of implementation of\r\nthe Agreed Framework between the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nand thus save face since it could not intervene in the talks\r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and\r\nthe United States. What South Korea should bear in mind\r\nis that the dogs may bark but the train moves on.\r\nMr. Chon (Republic of Korea): North Korea put\r\nforward the Agreed Framework as an excuse for non-\r\ncompliance with the safeguards agreement under the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). North Korea is, of course, obligated to implement\r\nthe Agreed Framework, just as it is obligated to abide by\r\nthe South/North joint declaration on the denuclearization\r\nof the Korean Peninsula signed in December 1991.\r\nWe have no doubt that these bilateral arrangements\r\nare important for the ultimate resolution of the North\r\nKorean nuclear issue. However, from the multilateral\r\nperspective of the United Nations and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), these bilateral\r\narrangements have relevance and significance by virtue of\r\nthe way in which they can strengthen the global non-\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nproliferation regime. As such, the Agreed Framework can\r\nbe a supplementary step, in support of multilateral efforts\r\nunder the auspices of the Security Council and the IAEA,\r\ntowards resolving the North Korean nuclear issue; it cannot\r\nreplace, supersede or detract from North Korea’s\r\nmultilateral obligations to all States parties to the NPT.\r\nActing upon the Agreed Framework, the Security\r\nCouncil, in its presidential statement of 4 November 1994\r\n(S/PRST/1994/64), underlined that the safeguards agreement\r\nbetween the IAEA and the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea remains binding and in force. As long as the\r\nsafeguards agreement remains binding and in force, it is\r\nclear that North Korea has the legal obligation to comply\r\nfully with the terms of an agreement it entered into of its\r\nown free will. When it does not, that constitutes an act of\r\nnon-compliance.\r\nGiven the important responsibility of this world body\r\nto monitor and ensure compliance by States parties with\r\ntheir commitments under the NPT and safeguard\r\nagreements, we feel we can take it for granted that the\r\nAssembly registers due concern over North Korea’s\r\ncontinuing non-compliance with its safeguards agreement,\r\nand urges North Korea to come promptly into full\r\ncompliance.\r\nThe IAEA General Conference sent an unmistakable\r\nmessage to this effect when, at its thirty-ninth session, last\r\nSeptember, it adopted the resolution on the North Korean\r\nnuclear issue without a single vote against. We are pleased\r\nthat this world body has just endorsed the resolution by the\r\nGeneral Conference on the IAEA on the non-compliance by\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea with its\r\nsafeguards agreement.\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): The South Korean representative has once again\r\nrevealed his ignorance. I should like to advise him to read\r\ncarefully the Agreed Framework between the United States\r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The\r\nAgreed Framework was welcomed by the Security Council\r\nand the IAEA. It stipulates when we should cooperate fully\r\nwith the IAEA, and I wish to state clearly, once again, that\r\nany resolution in any organization is worthless if the\r\nAgreed Framework is not implemented.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration\r\nof agenda item 14?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 156 (continued)\r\nMultilingualism\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.6/Rev.1)\r\nAmendments (A/50/L.8 and A/50/L.9)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative\r\nof France to introduce the revised draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/50/L.6/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like to introduce the revised version of draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1, which was distributed as an\r\nofficial document yesterday and on which we will be\r\ntaking a vote.\r\nThe only paragraph of the draft which differs from\r\nthe version of the text distributed previously is operative\r\nparagraph 3, and I should say right away that the\r\nsponsors have striven in this paragraph to take as much\r\naccount as possible of the legitimate concerns expressed\r\nby some delegations, in particular within the Asian\r\nGroup.\r\nThese delegations have asked us to show some\r\nsympathy for the situation of nationals of countries which\r\ndo not commonly use one of the official languages of the\r\nUnited Nations. It seemed to them too much to ask that\r\non recruitment, all United Nations staff members should\r\nspeak two of the official languages, at least one of which\r\nmust be a working language. This, they said, imposed on\r\nthem a need to acquire two languages in order to join the\r\nOrganization, which could be discriminatory in favour of\r\nthe nationals of countries which use one of the official\r\nlanguages and who would thus have to acquire only one\r\nmore language in order to enter the Organization.\r\nHowever, some of the Asian representatives told us\r\nthey saw no obstacle to the practice of a second official\r\nlanguage being encouraged strongly within the\r\nOrganization and that account should be taken of the\r\nefforts in this regard by officials who, during their\r\ncareers, acquire a degree of linguistic competence which\r\nno one can deny is of great importance for an\r\nOrganization such as ours.\r\nThe sponsors agreed entirely with this point of view\r\nand therefore took a major step towards the position of\r\nthe countries which had made that comment. This was not\r\na matter of course: it meant giving up an element\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nintroduced in draft resolution A/50/L.6 — the requirement\r\nfor a second official language on recruitment, which was\r\nnew. In this regard, the revised draft reverts to the legal\r\nstatus quo going back to resolution 2480 B (XXIII) of 21\r\nDecember 1968.\r\nI would stress that there is no difference between new\r\nparagraph 3 and what derives from the set of provisions in\r\nresolution 2480 B (XXIII): the recruitment requirement of\r\nproficiency in at least one of the working languages of the\r\nSecretariat reproduces subparagraph 1 (a) (i) of the 1968\r\nresolution and the fact that it is nevertheless possible to\r\nrecruit, on contracts of under two years, people who speak\r\none of the working languages of an organ of the United\r\nNations to fill posts in services working for those organs\r\nreproduces the next subparagraph of subparagraph 1 (a).\r\nThe request that the use of a second official language\r\nbe taken into account when promotions and incremental\r\nsteps are under consideration is precisely what emerges\r\nfrom the two subparagraphs of subparagraph 1 (b) and\r\nparagraph 3. The provisions of the resolution of 1968 make\r\nit clear that promotions are subject to\r\n“Adequate and confirmed knowledge of a second\r\nlanguage”. (resolution 2480 B (XXIII), para. 1 (b) (ii))\r\nWhen we say, in our text, that due account must be taken\r\nof such knowledge we are not going beyond the 1968\r\ntext — quite the contrary. We stick to reaffirming the 1968\r\ntext, without any addition. Also, the notion of linguistic\r\nbalance within the Organization is itself drawn from the\r\nchapeau to paragraph 1 of resolution 2480 B (XXIII).\r\nThis being the case, I ask all delegations here to\r\nplease understand that the sponsors went as far as they\r\npossibly could while still staying true to their own draft. As\r\nI said when I presented it almost a fortnight ago, this draft\r\nis in no way a modification of the law in force in the\r\nUnited Nations: rather, it is an appeal for the fundamental\r\nprovisions governing United Nations practice with regard to\r\nlanguages to be better observed, accorded more respect and\r\nmore fully applied.\r\nI believe that this is a very strong imperative on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary, at a time when a\r\nregrettable drift towards monolingualism is becoming more\r\nwidespread and more entrenched. Hence, the sponsors,\r\nthough they would like to see the text adopted by\r\nconsensus, are determined not to give in to manoeuvres that\r\nare all-too-obviously designed to intimidate. The proposed\r\namendments that have been circulated to Member States by\r\none delegation are totally unacceptable in this connection\r\nbecause they would all have the effect of reducing the\r\nscope of the text to nothing and of causing a regression\r\nin current United Nations practice towards\r\nimpoverishment, towards discrimination in favour of a\r\nsingle Secretariat language, and towards the death of any\r\nUnited Nations action to promote cultural diversity. That\r\nis why France, in solidarity with all the other sponsors of\r\nthe draft resolution — and I should point out in this\r\nconnection that the following countries have been added\r\nto the list: Afghanistan, Cape Verde, China, Kazakstan\r\nand the Lao People’s Democratic Republic — feels that\r\nthe draft resolutions, in its revised form, is a compromise\r\nthat should be acceptable to all delegations of good will\r\nthat do not want to depart from the rules on these matters\r\nthat the Organization has built up over the course of its\r\nhistory.\r\nI therefore commend this text to all our colleagues\r\nand ask them not to accept without substantiation the\r\nallegations on its supposed content that have been made\r\nby one delegation and thus demonstrate their commitment\r\nto a living and effective United Nations that truly works\r\nin diversity, to the benefit of the Member States.\r\nMr. Deineko (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): As has been noted by the General\r\nAssembly on many occasions, the use of different\r\nlanguages in the United Nations enriches the Organization\r\nand is a means of achieving the purposes set out in the\r\nCharter. On many occasions, the General Assembly has\r\nreaffirmed the need to ensure equal treatment of the\r\nofficial and working languages of the Organization, in\r\naccordance with the Assembly’s rules of procedure. The\r\nfact that there are both official and working languages\r\nand the status accorded them under the rules of procedure\r\nreflect the universal nature of the Organization and, in a\r\nmediated form, of the cultural diversity of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe political importance of this question is obvious\r\nright now, just as the results of the Organization’s first 50\r\nyears’ work are being reviewed. The experience acquired\r\nover those years shows that the United Nations has\r\nsucceeded in striking an extremely successful balance\r\nbetween the need for the fullest possible reflection of the\r\nworld’s linguistic and cultural diversity and considerations\r\nof ensuring the viability of the Organization’s machinery.\r\nIt is precisely this factor which, of all others, has made\r\npossible the harmonious integration of new countries into\r\nthe practical activities of the United Nations — and the\r\ncurrent membership exceeds by far the number of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nfounding States. Of course, this all has to do with the\r\nevents of the past few years and the accession to active\r\nparticipation of new, independent States that can use, within\r\nthe Organization, a language that a majority of their citizens\r\nknow.\r\nNaturally, the legally backed principle of the equality\r\nof the official and working languages — a principle that\r\nhas stood the test of time — ought to be reaffirmed by the\r\nAssembly. Nor is it any less important to adopt measures\r\nthat would make it possible to avoid violations of that\r\nprinciple. Here, the important thing is to ensure that\r\nMember States are simultaneously provided with equal\r\nservices — equal in terms of both volume and quality —\r\nin all languages, official and working.\r\nIn that light, the Russian delegation joined the\r\nsponsors of the original draft resolution on multilingualism,\r\nand guided by the spirit of compromise and having tried to\r\nensure that the comments expressed at previous meetings\r\nwere taken into account as fully as possible, is prepared to\r\nsupport the draft in its revised form.\r\nMr. Shongwe (Swaziland): My delegation has a\r\nproblem with regard to this draft resolution, which seeks to\r\noutlaw some bona fide Members of the United Nations. Let\r\nit be said that in the past 50 years the question of language\r\nhas never been in any way responsible for either the\r\nfailures or the successes of the Organization.\r\nInstead, unity of purpose and political will have been\r\nthe paramount factor in the strength and operation of the\r\nUnited Nations, and it is on this that the Organization is\r\nentirely dependent. This draft resolution will tend to create\r\na split among the Member States at a time when unity\r\namong them is a prerequisite for the success of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation, through you, Sir, appeals to the\r\nAssembly to spend its energy, time and effort on those\r\nissues that pertain to development, especially of the\r\ndeveloping nations. This draft resolution, if adopted, will\r\nhave negative financial implications for the developing\r\nnations. It will also require that budgets be set aside by\r\nboth the United Nations and the Member States towards\r\nmanpower development for purposes of meeting the\r\ndemands of the draft resolution.\r\nMy delegation therefore urges the Assembly to reject\r\nthis draft resolution or defer the voting for further\r\nconsultations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI call on the representative of the United States, who\r\nhas asked to speak on a point of order.\r\nMr. Birenbaum (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States believes that further time is needed for\r\ndiscussions with the co-sponsors of the text contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.6/Rev.1 in order to seek to achieve\r\nconsensus on the draft resolution.\r\nAs a multicultural society, the United States fully\r\nappreciates and respects the value of multilingualism. For\r\nthis reason, we attach considerable importance to adopting\r\na forward-looking resolution under this item and doing\r\nthat by consensus. Unfortunately, the text we have before\r\nus contains ambiguities and inconsistencies. We regret\r\nthat there has not been adequate opportunity to discuss\r\nthe provisions of draft resolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1 with its\r\nco-sponsors, although that would surely be the appropriate\r\nway to proceed.\r\nAs a result, portions of the text remain unacceptable.\r\nOur principal concern is that operative paragraph 3, even\r\nas revised, deviates from the current rules contained in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2480 (XXIII) B. Operative\r\nparagraph 3 of draft resolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1, for\r\nexample, does not conform to that earlier resolution.\r\nProvisions in that resolution relating to promotions apply\r\nonly to professional-level positions. Any revision of the\r\nrules must first be given due consideration by the\r\nappropriate committee of the General Assembly. That\r\nimportant step has been skipped in formulating this draft\r\nresolution. We believe that this concern can be met by\r\nappropriate consultations that could result in a consensus\r\ntext.\r\nIf we are required to consider this draft resolution\r\ntoday, we, along with other delegations, will have no\r\nchoice other than to vote against it. That is not a desirable\r\nway to deal with this important matter and that is not the\r\nway we would prefer. We would strongly prefer that a\r\nreasonable time be allowed for those of us who have\r\nproblems with the draft resolution to consult with the co-\r\nsponsors with a view to reaching consensus. If the\r\nobjective of the co-sponsors is to reaffirm our shared\r\ncommitment to multilingualism at the United Nations, and\r\nnot to change the relevant rules, I can assure them that\r\nthere should be no difficulty in achieving consensus after\r\nappropriate consultation.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nThere is no compelling reason why the draft resolution\r\nbefore us must be adopted today. Why not take the time\r\nnecessary to bring the world together on this text so that we\r\ncan all join in adopting by consensus a resolution on the\r\nsubject of multilingualism?\r\nI move, under rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to defer consideration of this item to a\r\nfuture meeting later this month, after the conclusion of\r\nconsultations. We would hope that we can look to the\r\nPresident’s good offices to organize these consultations.\r\nThe Acting President: The representative of the\r\nUnited States has moved, within the terms of rule 74 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the adjournment of the debate on the\r\nitem under discussion until later this month.\r\nAccording to rule 74 of the rules of procedure:\r\n“During the discussion of any matter, a\r\nrepresentative may move the adjournment of the\r\ndebate on the item under discussion. In addition to the\r\nproposer of the motion, two representatives may speak\r\nin favour of, and two against, the motion, after which\r\nthe motion shall be immediately put to the vote. The\r\nPresident may limit the time to be allowed to speakers\r\nunder this rule.”\r\nI call on the representative of Japan.\r\nMr. Kumamaru (Japan): The draft resolution before\r\nus is of great interest and great importance to my\r\ndelegation as well as to many others. My delegation\r\nsupports the preservation and promotion of cultural\r\ndiversity in this Organization. It believes that\r\nmultilingualism is one important factor in doing this.\r\nHowever, we should all be aware that there are\r\nnumerous cultures not associated with the six official\r\nlanguages. Personnel who come from those cultures should\r\nnot be penalized and unduly discriminated against. Fairer\r\ntreatment of these people would serve the overall objectives\r\nof cultural diversity.\r\nThe second part of paragraph 3 of draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.6/Rev.1 would give advantage to personnel whose\r\nmother tongue is one of the six languages and would\r\npenalize those whose mother tongue is not one of those six.\r\nThe latter deserve due consideration and fair competition.\r\nUnfortunately, therefore, paragraph 3, as revised, does not\r\nmeet our modest request.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, this draft resolution is\r\ntoo important for us to deal with in a hasty manner.\r\nCareful consideration by as many delegations as possible\r\nwould contribute to the improvement of the draft\r\nresolution and to its successful adoption by consensus.\r\nUnfortunately, no real consultation has taken place so far.\r\nMy delegation seconds the proposal put forward by\r\nthe United States delegation to defer action on a\r\nresolution so that the resolution will be blessed with\r\nadoption by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Fiji.\r\nMr. Bune (Fiji): My country also attaches great\r\nimportance to this item and we therefore support the\r\nmotion that a decision on this draft resolution be deferred\r\nuntil we have had further consultations with a view to\r\nadopting a resolution by consensus.\r\nWe understand the preoccupation of those who are\r\nconcerned that the proceedings of the Organization be\r\nconducted in all the official languages and that the\r\ndocumentation of the Organization be made available\r\nsimultaneously. However, that is different from trying to\r\nimpose additional foreign languages on nationals of States\r\nwhose mother tongue is not one of the six official\r\nlanguages of the Organization. It is difficult enough for\r\nthem to communicate in one of these official languages.\r\nWe recognize that there are two working languages\r\nof the Secretariat and that these should be used as far as\r\npracticable. The Secretariat has worked quite well for the\r\npast 50 years. Perhaps its use of languages should be\r\nimproved, but to create conditions for recruitment and\r\npromotion within the Secretariat of the kind envisaged in\r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/50/L.6/Rev.1\r\nis deliberately to discriminate against nationals of States\r\nwhose mother tongue is not one of the official languages\r\nof the Organization or of the Secretariat.\r\nThere is in fact nothing wrong with the present rules\r\nregarding language. The problem is that the Organization\r\ndoes not provide enough resources in the form of\r\ninterpretation, translation and other aspects of document\r\nservices. This cannot be resolved by imposing the\r\ndiscriminatory conditions contained in the draft resolution.\r\nSince the purpose of this draft resolution is to\r\nchange the Secretariat’s recruitment and promotion rules,\r\nwe believe that this matter should first be considered in\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nthe administrative and budgetary Committee, since there are\r\nboth administrative and budgetary implications. In any case,\r\na decision on this draft resolution should be deferred until\r\nwe have had further consultations and I therefore support\r\nthe motion made by the representative of the United States\r\nof America.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nArgentina.\r\nMrs. Fernández de Gurmendi (Argentina)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): A proposal has been made to\r\ndefer the debate on the draft resolution on multilingualism.\r\nHowever, this draft resolution which we are considering\r\ntoday is practically identical to the one which has been\r\nconsidered by delegations for two weeks, since 20 October,\r\nwhen we met in this Hall to deal with this item.\r\nSince that day, some delegations have expressed to us\r\ntheir concerns on one of the paragraphs of the draft\r\nresolution, operative paragraph 3. It was pointed out to us\r\nthat this paragraph would result in a modification of the\r\nsystem of recruitment and promotion of staff.\r\nIn response to those concerns, the co-sponsors of the\r\ndraft resolution began a process of consultations, which led\r\nto the revised version now before the Assembly. In the new\r\nversion, operative paragraph 3 has been modified in such a\r\nway that it is limited to summarizing the existing rules in\r\nthe matter contained in Assembly resolution 2480 B\r\n(XXIII) of 1968 which relates to the linguistic abilities of\r\npersonnel.\r\nWith this modification, the draft resolution we are\r\nconsidering is in its totality confined to reaffirming\r\nresolutions and other provisions which are in force with\r\nregard to the use of the Organization’s official and working\r\nlanguages, and to highlighting the need to strictly respect\r\nthese provisions. There has been no modification of any of\r\nthe existing provisions; there has been no amendment of the\r\nsystem of recruitment and promotion of staff.\r\nIn the light of what I have said and of the process of\r\nconsultations which has taken place since 20 October, it\r\ndoes not seem reasonable for delegations and the\r\nOrganization to continue to allocate time and attention to\r\nthe consideration of a question which in no way changes\r\nthe existing system.\r\nIn those circumstances, we consider that the process\r\nof consultations has been concluded and that the motion to\r\ndefer the adoption of a decision on this question should\r\nbe rejected. We hope a decision can be adopted today.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative\r\nof France.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nI am speaking in order to request members of the\r\nAssembly not to vote in favour of this motion for\r\nadjournment that has just been presented under rule 74 of\r\nthe rules of procedure.\r\nI should like to say first of all that France, with all\r\nthe co-sponsors of the draft resolution submitted to the\r\nAssembly, has engaged in extremely broad consultations\r\non this text since this item was inscribed as a new item\r\non the agenda of this session. In this connection, I should\r\nlike to respond to my colleague from Japan by saying that\r\nhe should take into account the fact that these\r\nconsultations took place. All the requested amendments\r\nwhich were based on important and legitimate concerns\r\nof some States, and which could be included without\r\ndistorting the text, have been included in our revised draft\r\nthat members of the Assembly have before them.\r\nHence, we have reached the conclusion that\r\nadditional consultations would not at this stage be likely\r\nto improve the draft resolution. We think that the proposal\r\nmade by the delegation which presented the motion for\r\nadjournment is not, in fact, designed to improve the text,\r\nbut, rather, would deprive it of any practical effect, and\r\nrender it totally meaningless.\r\nI regret that I have to say this, but the motion does\r\nnot seem to us to be made in good faith. It seems to us\r\nthat it is nothing but a delaying tactic designed to bury\r\nthis draft resolution, or defer it sine die, indeed to bury it\r\nin the sand, from which it may emerge only in an\r\nunrecognizable form, if that.\r\nI think that no one here is deceived by the deep\r\nmeaning of this operation. In fact, the idea is to have us\r\nendorse a monolingual trend, which is only too obvious\r\nin the Secretariat and in the United Nations organ as a\r\nwhole.\r\nWe also had hoped that this text could be adopted\r\nby consensus, and we believe we have done all in our\r\npower to achieve that goal. But if an effort is being made\r\nto force us to move backwards, and to stop championing\r\nthe linguistic principles of the Organization, then we\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 1 November 1995\r\nbelieve it is our duty not to yield, regardless of the source\r\nof the pressures.\r\nThat is why, Sir, through you I should like to request\r\nall delegations to vote against the motion for adjournment\r\npresented under rule 74.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard two speakers\r\nin favour of and two against the motion. In accordance with\r\nrule 74 of the rules of procedure I shall now put to the vote\r\nimmediately the motion to adjourn the debate on the item\r\nunder discussion until later in the month.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAustralia, Austria, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados,\r\nBelize, Bhutan, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam,\r\nCroatia, Cyprus, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji,\r\nFinland, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana,\r\nHungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica,\r\nJapan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Lithuania,\r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Micronesia\r\n(Federated States of), Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia,\r\nNepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,\r\nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Republic of\r\nKorea, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Singapore, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka,\r\nSuriname,\r\nSwaziland, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey,\r\nUganda, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nUnited States of America, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nAlbania, Argentina, Armenia, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso,\r\nBurundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape\r\nVerde, Chad, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo,\r\nCosta Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Denmark, Djibouti,\r\nDominica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, France,\r\nGabon, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nHaiti, Honduras, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Ireland,\r\nItaly, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lebanon,\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, Luxembourg, Madagascar,\r\nMali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico,\r\nMonaco, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger,\r\nOman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal,\r\nQatar, Republic of Moldova, Romania, San Marino,\r\nSaudi Arabia, Senegal, Spain, Sudan, Sweden,\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Togo, Tunisia, Uruguay,\r\nVenezuela, Viet Nam\r\nAbstaining:\r\nBelgium, Czech Republic, Kazakstan, Russian\r\nFederation, Rwanda, Yemen\r\nThe motion was rejected by 75 votes to 70, with 6\r\nabstentions.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will continue\r\nconsideration of agenda item 156, “Multilingualism”, as\r\nthe second item tomorrow morning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6:20 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
