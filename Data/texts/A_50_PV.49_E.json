(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Peerthum\r\n(Mauritius), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 156 (continued)\r\nMultilingualism\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1\r\nAmendments: A/50/l.8; A/50/L.9; A/50/L.14\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nattention of members to document A/50/L.14, which\r\ncontains the two amendments proposed orally by Australia\r\nthis morning.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.6/Rev.1 and the amendments thereto contained in\r\ndocuments A/50/L.8, A/50/L.9 and A/50/L.14, the last.\r\nIn accordance with rule 90 of the rules of procedure,\r\nthe amendments are voted on first. Rule 90 also stipulates\r\nthat:\r\n“When two or more amendments are moved to a\r\nproposal, the General Assembly shall first vote on the\r\namendment furthest removed in substance from the\r\noriginal proposal and then on the amendment next\r\nfurthest removed therefrom, and so on until all the\r\namendments have been put to the vote. Where,\r\nhowever, the adoption of one amendment necessarily\r\nimplies the rejection of another amendment, the\r\nlatter amendment shall not be put to the vote. If one\r\nor more amendments are adopted, the amended\r\nproposal shall then be voted upon.”\r\nWe shall proceed to take a decision first on the\r\namendment proposed by Malaysia, contained in document\r\nA/50/L.9, which is furthest removed in substance from the\r\noriginal proposal. Depending on the result of the vote, we\r\nmay or we may not vote on the amendment proposed by\r\nJapan, contained in document A/50/L.8, and on that\r\nproposed by Australia contained in paragraph 2 of\r\ndocument A/50/L.14. We shall then proceed to take a\r\ndecision on the amendment proposed by Australia in\r\nparagraph 1 of document A/50/L.14.\r\nIf there is no objection to this procedure, I shall take\r\nit that the Assembly agrees to it.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nproceed to take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/40/L.6/Rev.1 and the proposed amendments thereto.\r\nI call on the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Perfiliev (Director, General Assembly Affairs\r\nDivision): I have been informed that the adoption of draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1 would not give rise to\r\nprogramme budget implications.\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 November 1995\r\nThe Acting President: Before calling on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to explain their votes before the\r\nvoting, may I remind delegations that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Birenbaum (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States has requested a vote on this draft resolution\r\nand will vote “no”.\r\nWe fully appreciate and respect multilingualism and\r\nthe importance of providing interpretation and access to\r\nUnited Nations documents in the official languages of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe are concerned, however, that the provisions of the\r\nresolution before us go beyond accepted concepts of\r\nmultilingualism within the United Nations system. The text\r\nas currently drafted raises a number of issues, not least of\r\nwhich is the fact that it would alter existing rules without\r\nfollowing the proper procedures.\r\nThe second preambular paragraph introduces the\r\nconcept of a “corollary” to universality, “multilingualism”.\r\nTo our knowledge, this concept has not been accepted by\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe fifth preambular paragraph is inconsistent with\r\noperative paragraph 3 in that it calls for all applicants for\r\nUnited Nations positions to have command of two of the\r\nofficial languages.\r\nConcerning the sixth preambular paragraph, our\r\ndelegation has noted on several occasions that budgetary\r\nconstraints impact on all activities of the Organization and\r\ncannot be ignored.\r\nConcerning the eighth preambular paragraph, we are\r\nnot aware of any mandate which requires that the United\r\nNations become in effect a language school for Member\r\nStates and staff. In fact, the Fifth Committee, the competent\r\nbody on these issues, awaits a request from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the United Nations language teaching\r\nprogramme and will then consider the issue.\r\nConcerning operative paragraph 3, we believe that, as\r\ndrafted, the language would request the Secretary-General\r\nto ensure that competence in two languages would be a\r\nfactor in promotions at all levels of the United Nations. The\r\nexisting rules on language competence in relation to\r\npromotion do not apply to the support staff.\r\nWe have concerns regarding operative paragraph 4,\r\nwhich calls for “equality” of the two working languages\r\nin hiring and promotions. This represents a new criterion,\r\nand we are not clear as to its meaning. We assume that it\r\nis not the intent of this language to establish a quota\r\nsystem for hiring much like the geographical distribution\r\nsystem. However, the provision is ambiguous in that\r\nregard.\r\nFinally, we note that there has been no estimate of\r\nexpenditures, as required by rule 153 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, for this draft resolution. From this we surmise\r\nthat there will be no expenditure of any kind in\r\nimplementing the provisions of this draft resolution and\r\nthat, therefore, all the activities required by this draft\r\nresolution can and will be accomplished within existing\r\nresources. In our view, a paragraph to this effect should\r\nhave been included in this draft resolution.\r\nMr. Yoogalingam (Malaysia): I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to appeal to members of the General\r\nAssembly to give careful consideration before a vote is\r\ntaken on the proposed amendment, in document A/50/L.9,\r\nto operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution in\r\ndocument A/50/L.6/Rev.1.\r\nThe draft resolution in that document embodies a\r\nconcept dear to us all, and would contribute to the\r\npromotion of multilingualism in the Organization.\r\nHowever, we are of the view that it would place those\r\ncountries whose native tongue is not one of the six United\r\nNations languages at a serious disadvantage. It is indeed\r\nironic that, in the quest to achieve parity between the six\r\nUnited Nations languages, those already disadvantaged\r\nwould be further discriminated against.\r\nWe recognize that the revised operative paragraph 3\r\nin document A/50/L.6/Rev.1 attempts to take on board\r\nsome of the concerns expressed by those countries whose\r\nnative tongue is not one of the six United Nations\r\nlanguages. However, we are of the view that it does not\r\nadequately address our concerns: it is inconsistent with\r\nmultilingualism and does not safeguard the interests of\r\nthose whose mother tongue is not one of the six United\r\nNations languages. It would have been helpful if the\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution had been prepared to\r\naccept the word “encourage” instead of the word “ensure”\r\nin the current draft resolution. The word “encourage” is\r\nthe term used in previous resolutions and is one that\r\ncould help forge a consensus on this draft resolution.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 November 1995\r\nAs we have had insufficient time to consider the draft\r\nresolution in question, and we would request the sponsors\r\nto exercise patience and understanding for those of us who\r\nhave serious problems with operative paragraph 3.\r\nMs. Eerikäinen (Finland): It is a long-standing and\r\nfirm policy of Finland not to oppose the inclusion of new\r\nitems on the agenda of the General Assembly. The\r\nnecessary corollary of this policy is that delegations must\r\nbe given adequate time and adequate opportunity to study\r\nnew proposals so that a consensus or a largely satisfactory\r\ncompromise solution can be reached by Member States.\r\nIn this case, those conditions have, unfortunately, not\r\nbeen met. In our view, there would have been room to seek\r\ncompromise, and further efforts should have been made to\r\nsee whether the draft resolution on this important item\r\ncould have been adopted by consensus. It was on this\r\nground, and this ground only, that Finland voted in favour\r\nof the motion to defer treatment of this item yesterday, and\r\nis also why Finland will abstain in any and all votes on the\r\ntext of the draft resolution today.\r\nI want to emphasize that our votes yesterday and today\r\nmust not be construed as being in any way against\r\nmultilingualism. On the contrary: Finland considers the\r\nissue before us to be of great importance to all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations. Itself a constitutionally\r\nbilingual country, Finland values linguistic and cultural\r\ndiversity and supports strict observance of the rules\r\nconcerning the equality of the six official languages and of\r\nthe working languages of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nI have taken the floor in order to ask that members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly do not put into effect the amendment\r\nproposed by the delegation of Japan or the one tabled by\r\nthe delegation of Malaysia. In my explanations I will\r\nconcentrate on the Japanese amendment.\r\nEven before it proposed its amendment, the Japanese\r\ndelegation asked us for our understanding for the situation\r\nof nationals of countries where one of the official languages\r\nof the United Nations is not in common use. To require of\r\nthem, on recruitment, mastery of two official languages, at\r\nleast one of which must be a working language of the\r\nSecretariat, would be likely to cause them serious problems.\r\nIn fact, the sponsors of the draft resolution, showing great\r\nsympathy for the concerns expressed by the Japanese\r\ndelegation, were won over completely to their point of\r\nview. I should like to emphasize that this was not a self-\r\nevident step, because it involved giving up an important,\r\ninnovative element in the initial draft of the resolution, in\r\ndocument A/50/L.6.\r\nWe have therefore proposed in the revised draft\r\nresolution to return to the legal status quo ante by sticking\r\nstrictly to the provisions of resolution 2480 B (XXIII) of\r\n21 December 1968, that is to say, in requiring a staff\r\nmember at the moment of recruitment to be able to use\r\none of the working languages of the Secretariat or one of\r\nthe working languages of a United Nations organ in the\r\ncase of staff members recruited for that organ and whose\r\ncontracts are for no more than two years.\r\nFinally, and also as in General Assembly resolution\r\n2480 B (XXIII), our revised draft resolution calls for the\r\nknowledge of a second official language to be taken into\r\naccount for promotion within and between grades. We\r\ntherefore believe that the concerns expressed by some\r\nAsian delegations have been fully taken into account in\r\nthe revised draft. The Assembly will understand that the\r\nsponsors cannot fall short of what has already been\r\nagreed upon in previous resolutions; that they cannot\r\nsanction a regression in the existing law. That would\r\nclearly be contrary to the spirit of our draft, and it would\r\ninevitably comfort and succour the very practices our\r\nresolution is intended to condemn.\r\nThe amendment proposed by the Japanese delegation\r\nis deliberately vague in its wording. A simple\r\nencouragement for staff members to use one more official\r\nlanguage in addition to a Secretariat working language\r\ndoes not imply any obligation on the Secretariat, and we\r\nhave a good idea that, in practice, such a formula would\r\nhave no effect.\r\nLike the amendment tabled by Malaysia, the\r\nJapanese amendment opens the door to all kinds of\r\nskullduggery with particular reference to the get-out\r\nclause for nationals whose mother tongue is not an\r\nofficial language of the United Nations. For all these\r\nreasons, and expressing the viewpoint of the sponsors as\r\nI do so, I ask through you, Sir, that all delegations vote\r\nagainst both the amendment proposed by Japan and the\r\none proposed by Malaysia.\r\nHowever, I do find it possible to agree with the two\r\namendments proposed by the Permanent Representative of\r\nAustralia. I thank him for his two suggestions, which we\r\nwill be able to vote for.\r\nMr. Laclaustra (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Spanish delegation wishes to make some\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 November 1995\r\nbrief comments on the amendments put forward by\r\nMalaysia and Japan to the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.6/Rev.1.\r\nMy delegation wishes to stress the fact that the\r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/50/L.6, inspired by our desire\r\nthat this draft resolution should reflect, as broadly as\r\npossible, the concerns of all delegations with a view to\r\nhaving the draft adopted by consensus, held several\r\nmeetings with the sponsors of the amendments in order to\r\naccommodate their points of view. Consequently, revised\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.6 incorporates new drafting in\r\noperative paragraph 3 which reproduces resolution 2480 B\r\n(XXIII), of 1968. We firmly believe that this new text\r\nadequately reflects the concerns expressed to the sponsors.\r\nWe therefore regret the fact that those behind these\r\namendments are still maintaining them. Consequently, the\r\ndelegation of Spain will vote against the amendments\r\ncontained in documents A/50/L.8 and L.9.\r\nOn the other hand, my delegation this morning heard\r\nthe proposal by the representative of Australia, who\r\nsuggested additions to both the fourth preambular paragraph\r\nof draft resolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1 and to its operative\r\nparagraph 3, which have been distributed in document\r\nA/50/L.14. We would like to thank Australia for its\r\nconstructive contributions to our consideration of draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.6, and would like to say that we will vote\r\nin favour of those suggestions.\r\nMs. Fernández de Gurmendi (Argentina)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): My delegation wishes to\r\nspeak on the proposed amendments to the draft resolution\r\non multilingualism: these are the amendments contained in\r\ndocuments A/50/L.8, L.9 and L.14.\r\nAs to the amendments contained in documents\r\nA/50/L.8 and A/50/L.9, we would like to say that my\r\ndelegation has a great deal of sympathy for the difficulties\r\nfaced by people whose mother tongue is not one of the\r\nofficial languages of the Organization, although those\r\ndifficulties are not substantially different from those faced\r\nby most delegations in an Organization which is\r\nincreasingly locking itself into monolingualism.\r\nDespite our sympathy for these difficulties, my\r\ndelegation feels that the proposed amendments would\r\nmodify the existing legal regime for staff recruitment and\r\npromotion. We believe that modifications to the complex\r\nset of personnel procedures require in-depth study to\r\nanalyse all the possible consequences, including budgetary\r\nones. My delegation will therefore vote against the\r\namendments proposed in documents A/50/L.8 and L.9.\r\nHowever, my delegation does welcome the\r\namendments proposed by Australia in document\r\nA/50/L.14. Indeed, my delegation would like to thank the\r\nPermanent Representative of Australia for those\r\namendments, which significantly improve the text of the\r\ndraft resolution, and wishes to state that it will vote in\r\nfavour of them.\r\nMr. Gervais (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Malaysia has proposed that we replace operative\r\nparagraph 3 in document A/50/L.6/Rev.1 with an\r\namended one. We think that if we adopt Malaysia’s\r\nproposal we would be taking a very regrettable step\r\nbackward, because it would sanction the very\r\nmonolingualism that our Organization has striven to avoid\r\never since it was set up. It is imperative that, in our\r\nOrganization, we must avoid establishing categories of\r\nstaff members: those whose mother tongue is one of the\r\nofficial languages of the United Nations, and those whose\r\noriginal language is not. And Malaysia’s proposal calls on\r\nus to do just this.\r\nThis kind of discrimination — or disparity — is\r\nquite obviously something we should prohibit.\r\nFurthermore, how can we incorporate the idea of a\r\nmother tongue into a universal Organization such as ours.\r\nWith regard to African countries — including mine,\r\nwhere we speak almost 40 “mother tongues” — I cannot\r\neven begin to imagine how we would slot ourselves into\r\nthe United Nations framework. Consequently, my\r\ndelegation cannot go along with Malaysia’s proposal, and,\r\nwith regard to the Japanese amendment, my delegation,\r\nwhile understanding the concerns and worries of that\r\ncountry, does feel that, in any event, it would be a step\r\nbackwards from what has been built up ever since the\r\nUnited Nations was established.\r\nMy delegation therefore cannot accept those two\r\nproposed amendments, but I can say that we do accept\r\nthe Australian proposal in document A/50/L.14.\r\nMr. Mustafa (Sudan): The delegation of the Sudan\r\nwould like to join the group of countries sponsoring draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1.\r\nIn the meantime, and in conformity with the spirit of\r\nthe draft resolution before us, we share the deep concern\r\nof the Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions about the possible adverse effect of\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 November 1995\r\nthe proposed abolition of the two Language Coordinator\r\nposts from the training programme for all official languages\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nTo this effect, we recall resolution 42/207 C of 11\r\nDecember 1987, which affirms that the translation and\r\ninterpretation budgets of United Nations bodies should be\r\ncommensurate with needs and should not be subject to\r\nbudgetary constraints.\r\nMr. Chinvanno (Thailand): My delegation will be\r\nvoting against draft resolution A/50/L.6/Rev.1 on agenda\r\nitem 156, “Multilingualism”.\r\nWe regret that we must so decide, and that the\r\nAssembly is taking this course of action on a very\r\nimportant question involving the whole membership of the\r\nOrganization. My delegation is disappointed that there has\r\nnot been an adequate opportunity for the whole membership\r\nto discuss the provisions of the draft resolution in order to\r\nreach consensus.\r\nMy delegation feels compelled to vote against the draft\r\nresolution because we still have strong reservations about\r\noperative paragraph 3, even with the useful amendment\r\nproposed by the Permanent Representative of Australia. The\r\nparagraph, in our view, has grave implications for personnel\r\nmatters. In practical terms, requiring a command of two of\r\nthe six official languages would place at a serious\r\ndisadvantage personnel and potential recruits whose mother\r\ntongue is not one of the six official languages of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThailand wishes to reaffirm its commitment to\r\nmultiligualism at the United Nations, and to support the\r\nidea that the United Nations should promote cultural\r\ndiversity; but Thailand believes that the promotion of\r\ncultural diversity has as its central ideal the concepts of\r\ntolerance and understanding, which, in the context of this\r\nagenda item, should be extended to those cultures that, by\r\nforce of history, are not associated with any of the six\r\nofficial languages of this Organization.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): My delegation wishes to\r\nreiterate and reaffirm our observations on both the principal\r\ndraft resolution and the amendments. My delegation wishes\r\nto know, in the first place, why this draft resolution is a\r\nnecessity. Why are we not directing our energy and time to\r\nproblems within our nations and, indeed, the world over?\r\nDo we intend to dismantle the principle of solidarity\r\nat a time when it a matter of necessity within the United\r\nNations? My delegation feels that this draft resolution\r\ndiscriminates against the developing nations, which\r\notherwise have a legitimate right to have their nationals\r\nrecruited by the Secretariat.\r\nThis draft resolution does not indicate the time-frame\r\nfor Member States to train their nationals so that they\r\nqualify for employment by the United Nations.\r\nThe problems that face the United Nations do not\r\nhave their genesis in the use of a particular language.\r\nWhy, therefore, and why now, is the Organization being\r\nmade to think of the very tedious matter of which\r\nlanguages should be used as criteria in recruiting\r\nSecretariat staff members?\r\nIf I may ask, of these languages, how many will be\r\nfrom Africa, where I come from? Have the sponsors of\r\nthis draft resolution ever thought deeply, when talking of\r\ngeographical representation — as enshrined in the\r\nCharter — about including developing nations and,\r\nindeed, my own continent, Africa? Are we being\r\nreminded indirectly of those sad days and times when the\r\nvery same languages we are speaking today were imposed\r\nupon us by those who divided us in Africa and in the\r\ndeveloping nations elsewhere? Should the United Nations\r\nallow that same spirit to prevail and divide this body too?\r\nShould we again be instilled with the spirit of\r\ndivisiveness that, even today, most nations are suffering\r\nfrom?\r\nWhat is the role of the United Nations? Is it not to\r\npromote peace, unity and solidarity? The colonizers had\r\ntheir own agenda when they imposed their languages on\r\nthe developing nations, especially in Africa. Thanks to the\r\nscramble to colonize Africa, we were divided. Should we\r\nallow history to repeat itself today within the United\r\nNations?\r\nMy delegation would therefore humbly implore this\r\nbody to give serious consideration before adopting any\r\nsuch a draft resolution, and implores it especially to allow\r\ndelegations to consult — formally and informally — so\r\nthat the United Nations is not seen as playing the role of\r\ncolonizer among the developing nations.\r\nMr. Albín (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe delegation of Mexico is a sponsor of draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.6/Rev.1.\r\nFor several weeks now, we have been aware of the\r\nconcerns of some States whose national language is not\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 November 1995\r\none of the official languages of the United Nations. In the\r\nview of the sponsors, the essential aspects of those concerns\r\nhave been dealt with in the revised version of the draft\r\nresolution, document A/50/L.6/Rev.1. The sponsors have\r\nmade a genuine effort towards a rapprochement with those\r\ncountries.\r\nIt has been said that the draft resolution would change\r\npresent practice in hiring and promoting staff members. We\r\nare convinced that that is not the case. Paradoxically, the\r\namendments in documents A/50/L.8 and L.9 contain\r\nelements that, in our view, would indeed alter the present\r\npractice within the Organization if they were adopted.\r\nThe sponsors’ objective in draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.6/Rev.1 on multilingualism is a very simple one,\r\nand here I am forced to contradict the representative of\r\nSwaziland. The draft resolution has to do with the effective\r\nuse of the official and working languages of the United\r\nNations. It is a question of restoring a healthy linguistic\r\nbalance in the use of all those languages. The proposals in\r\nthe draft resolution, which are by any standards objective\r\nand reasonable, would be vitiated by the amendments in\r\ndocuments A/50/L.8 and L.9. My delegation will therefore\r\nvote against those amendments.\r\nMy delegation can, however, support the amendments\r\nproposed this morning in a constructive spirit by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Australia and now reflected in\r\ndocument A/50/L.14. The delegation of Mexico calls on the\r\nAssembly to vote in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.6/Rev.1 and of the amendments submitted by the\r\nAustralian delegation in document A/50/L.14, and urges it\r\nto vote against the amendments in documents A/50/L.8 and\r\nL.9.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the\r\namendment contained in document A/50/L.9.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAzerbaijan, Barbados, Bhutan, Bosnia

May I\r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are limited\r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Pine (New Zealand): It is with great regret that\r\nNew Zealand, a multicultural society with two official\r\nlanguages, has found itself unable to support a resolution\r\non multilingualism, a concept that we and every other\r\nUnited Nations Member supports. We are disappointed\r\nthat a minority of the membership of this body has\r\nsucceeded in preventing a consensus from being allowed\r\nto emerge on this important subject, when 70 Members,\r\nfrom all parts of the globe, had indicated the need for\r\nmore work to be done.\r\nAs the delegate of Malaysia has observed, there is\r\nan inescapable irony that on this fiftieth anniversary, in a\r\ntext that purports to celebrate the diversity of our\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 November 1995\r\nOrganization, we have been unable to accommodate the\r\nconcern which has been expressed by some of our\r\nMembers, in particular our friends in the South Pacific and\r\nAsia, over the problem faced by countries in which any\r\nUnited Nations language is a second language. This concern\r\nhas, from the moment it was raised, struck our delegation\r\nas genuinely held and reasonable. We remain convinced\r\nthat, with good faith, it could have been accommodated in\r\nthe resolution. The fact that it has not been can lead only\r\nto the conclusion that some of the sponsors were not really\r\ninterested in celebrating diversity, but instead were focused\r\nonly on extending a current privilege at the expense of\r\nother linguistic groups that are currently operating in a\r\nsituation of even greater hardship.\r\nWe noted very carefully the statements last night from\r\nthe sponsors that they did not intend to change the current\r\nrules concerning the employment and promotion of United\r\nNations staff. We must admit that this had not been clear\r\nto us from the ambiguous language of their draft resolution.\r\nIndeed, this was the very reason we had wished further\r\ntime to negotiate, and the reason we have been unable to\r\nsupport the text before us.\r\nWe should like the record of this meeting to reflect the\r\nunderstanding that the current resolution, which has not had\r\nthe benefit of consideration in the administrative and\r\nbudgetary Committee, cannot be interpreted as effecting a\r\nchange in resolution 2480 B (XXIII), including the\r\ndiscretion given to the Secretary-General in subparagraph\r\n1(b)(i).\r\nMr. Kumamaru (Japan): My delegation has been\r\ninstructed by its Government to make the following\r\nstatement.\r\nJapan voted against the resolution because its operative\r\nparagraph 3 penalizes staff members whose mother tongue\r\nis not one of the official languages of the United Nations.\r\nJapan finds the paragraph unacceptable. Such personnel,\r\nalready at a disadvantage, should not be subjected to an\r\nadditional penalty.\r\nMy delegation regrets that no real effort was made to\r\nreach an agreement before the draft resolution was put to\r\nthe vote. Had there been proper consultations in an\r\nappropriate committee, this measure would certainly have\r\nbeen adopted by consensus.\r\nMy delegation believes wholeheartedly in the\r\nimportance of preserving and promoting cultural diversity\r\nin the Organization. However, it is precisely for this reason\r\nthat due respect should be shown for those cultures not\r\nassociated with the official languages of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Shin (Republic of Korea): My delegation voted\r\nagainst the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/50/L.6/Rev.1. My delegation holds the view that the\r\nUnited Nations should not penalize personnel whose\r\nmother tongue is not one of the six official languages of\r\nthe United Nations. In my delegation’s view, linguistic\r\nbalance within the Organization could be achieved by\r\nencouraging Secretariat staff to gain proficiency in at least\r\none more of the other official languages of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation knows that a significant number of\r\nMember States have voted against the resolution. It is my\r\ndelegation’s hope that due consideration will be given to\r\nthis fact in implementing the resolution.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): Croatia would rather have\r\nhad more time to examine comprehensively this agenda\r\nitem and undertake further consultations in order to reach\r\na consensus on this important issue.\r\nCroatia firmly supports the principle of\r\nmultilingualism. For Croatians it has always been\r\nnecessary to learn languages other than their native\r\ntongue in order to be able to communicate with their\r\nneighbours and the rest of the international community.\r\nHowever, Croatia is a small country whose official\r\nlanguage is not one of the six official languages of the\r\nUnited Nations and whose citizens, prior to applying for\r\na position in the Secretariat, where Croatia is significantly\r\nunderrepresented, have to learn one of the working\r\nlanguages and continue with studies of the other\r\nlanguages, whether they are employed at the General\r\nService or the Professional level. Therefore, Croatia,\r\nbearing in mind the principle of the equality of all United\r\nNations Members, could not support some of the elements\r\ncontained in the draft resolution that favour some\r\nMembers over others.\r\nCroatia would also have preferred that the resolution\r\ninclude a request that the Secretary-General take into\r\naccount the difficulties faced by applicants whose mother\r\ntongue is not one of the official languages of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Katende (Uganda): Uganda encourages the\r\nprinciple of multilingualism in international relations.\r\nHowever, my delegation regrets that we have taken action\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 2 November 1995\r\nhurriedly on this matter. In our view, more consultations\r\nwere necessary in order to adopt a consensus resolution. In\r\nparticular, there are certain provisions contained in the\r\nresolution just disposed of that required further\r\nconsultations on the part of my delegation. We were denied\r\nthis opportunity, which is why we abstained in the voting\r\non the resolution.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 156?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.35 p.m.\r\n10\r\n"
