(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the first\r\nspeaker in the general debate, I should like to remind\r\nmembers of the decision taken by the General Assembly at\r\nits 3rd plenary meeting, on 22 September, that\r\ncongratulations should not be expressed inside the General\r\nAssembly Hall itself after a speech has been delivered.\r\nIn this connection, may I also remind members of\r\nanother decision taken by the Assembly at the same\r\nmeeting: that speakers in the general debate, after delivering\r\ntheir statements, would leave the Assembly Hall through\r\nroom GA-200, located behind the podium, before returning\r\nto their seats.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that in\r\naccordance with the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its 3rd plenary meeting, the list of speakers\r\nwill be closed on Wednesday, 27 September 1995, at\r\n6 p.m. May I request delegations to be good enough to\r\nprovide estimated speaking times that are as accurate as\r\npossible so that we can plan our meetings in an orderly\r\nway.\r\nI now call on the first speaker in the general debate,\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, my good friend\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Luiz Felipe Palmeira Lampreia.\r\nMr. Lampreia (Brazil) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to make use of our common language to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election. We are honoured\r\nto see a Portuguese statesman, a friend of Brazil, and a\r\nrepresentative of our commonwealth of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking countries presiding over this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, a session that is bound to become a\r\nmilestone in the history of the United Nations. My\r\nGovernment is confident that, under your skilled\r\nguidance, our deliberations will forge the kind of\r\nunderstanding and commitment capable of asserting the\r\ncredibility and pre-eminence of our Organization in world\r\naffairs.\r\nLet me also express our heartfelt appreciation to\r\nanother friend of Brazil, Minister Amara Essy of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, for his outstanding work at the helm of the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI wish to congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the Secretariat for their\r\ncontinued dedication to the United Nations and for their\r\nrelentless work in carrying out their duties to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn opening this debate today, Brazil wishes to renew\r\nits unwavering commitment to the principles and purposes\r\nembodied in the Charter of the United Nations. These\r\nprinciples and purposes set a mandate for peace and\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ndevelopment, and are as relevant today as they were 50\r\nyears ago. They coincide entirely with the aspirations of\r\nBrazilian society. Our Constitution reflects them as the\r\nsupreme values of our political and social life in\r\ndemocracy.\r\nI am proud to address the Assembly as the\r\nrepresentative of a country that has widened its\r\ncommitments to democracy and human rights, to\r\nsustainable development with economic stability, to peace\r\nand disarmament — a country at peace with itself,\r\nconstantly striving to extend its presence in the world by\r\nstrengthening traditional partnerships and fostering new\r\nones. We expect from our partners an attitude of\r\ncooperation commensurate with Brazil’s growing\r\nparticipation in world markets and with its contribution to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nDemocracy in Brazil continues to show extraordinary\r\nvitality under the leadership of President Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso. Our institutional framework is being strengthened,\r\nand progress in the social sphere is generating a renewed\r\nsense of citizenship among Brazilians.\r\nWhile strictly enforcing existing mechanisms,\r\nPresident Cardoso is proposing legislation that will ensure\r\nthe full observance of human rights. Both at home and\r\nabroad, Brazil’s human rights policies are based on\r\ntransparency and full cooperation with civil society.\r\nTogether with strong governmental action to tackle the\r\ncountry’s social problems, measures to promote and protect\r\nhuman rights will greatly contribute to redress the unjust\r\ndistribution of wealth that unfortunately still prevails in\r\nBrazil.\r\nLong-needed structural reforms and privatization are\r\nbeing carried out, paving the way for the consolidation of\r\neconomic stability and sustained economic growth.\r\nBrazil has achieved a high degree of economic\r\nopenness, thus accelerating its integration into the\r\ninternational economy and creating more favourable\r\nconditions for increased participation in international trade,\r\ntechnology transfers and productive capital flows. Inflation\r\nhas been reduced to the lowest level in a quarter of a\r\ncentury, allowing the country to pursue policies that benefit\r\nthe poor and the underprivileged.\r\nWe are also engaged in a broad and dynamic process\r\nof open economic integration with our neighbours, adding\r\neconomic substance to the political harmony that we enjoy\r\nin our region. MERCOSUR — a customs union bringing\r\ntogether Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay — is\r\na highly successful political and economic reality, a\r\npartner ready for business and cooperation with all\r\ncountries and regions.\r\nBrazil has taken significant steps to further\r\nstrengthen its commitments to disarmament and to the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nPresident Cardoso publicly stated that Brazil has forgone\r\nthe development, acquisition and export of long-range\r\nmilitary missiles. Congress is about to approve the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention, and comprehensive\r\nlegislation on export controls of dual-use technology is\r\nbeing finalized. Having decided unilaterally to abide by\r\nthe Missile Technology Control Regime’s guidelines, the\r\nBrazilian Government is currently discussing its\r\nparticipation in the regime.\r\nBrazil’s commitment to peace and understanding was\r\nclearly illustrated by its recent role, alongside the other\r\nthree Guarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol,\r\nin bringing together two friendly nations in our region —\r\nEcuador and Peru.\r\nBrazilian forces are actively participating in various\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts, particularly in\r\nAngola, a country that shares with Brazil a common\r\nheritage and is finally on the verge of healing the wounds\r\ninflicted by years of internal strife. We are also proud of\r\nthe role played by our Government and our forces in the\r\npeaceful transition to an elected government in\r\nMozambique.\r\nAfter too many years of difficulties, Brazilians have\r\nrecovered their pride. The country has entered a cycle of\r\nlong-term growth and greater long-term opportunities, an\r\nera of optimism and confidence. It is in this spirit that\r\nBrazilian diplomacy is prepared to approach the world\r\nand to work within the United Nations.\r\nAs I reflect upon the events that have taken place\r\nover this past year, I am tempted to say that\r\n“it was the best of times; it was the worst of times”.\r\nIt has been a time for legitimate hope, but also a\r\ntime of fear and horror; a time for accomplishments, but\r\nalso a time of frustration; a time for confidence in a\r\nbrighter future for mankind, but also a time of regret for\r\nthe fact that peace, freedom, justice and well-being are\r\nstill unattained in many places in the world; a time in\r\nwhich risks and opportunities coexist side by side.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nCurrent patterns in international affairs converge on\r\nthe twin concepts that inspired the revolution of the 1990s:\r\ndemocracy and economic freedom with social justice. This\r\nis the main thrust that will shape the coming century and\r\nensure liberty and prosperity for all.\r\nThe very concept of power has changed. A country’s\r\nsovereignty and its capacity to satisfy the needs of its\r\npeople depend increasingly on good social indicators,\r\npolitical stability, economic competitiveness, and scientific\r\nand technological progress, not on military strength. It is\r\nnow widely understood that the fulfilment of national pride\r\nlies in democracy, development, trade and economic wealth,\r\nrather than in the quest for hegemony or territorial gains.\r\nA new era of freedom is at hand. Countries are\r\npeacefully seeking their place in their regions and in the\r\nworld, helping in the creation of wealth through trade and\r\ncooperation. Emerging economies have become a\r\nsignificant force around the world, benefiting from\r\nglobalization, greater economic freedom and the continued\r\ngrowth of international trade. Economic integration has led\r\nto stronger regional ties.\r\nReconstruction and enhanced participation in\r\ninternational affairs are seen in many parts of the world,\r\njust as others continue to prosper and grow in peace. New\r\nor renewed partnerships have emerged in the five\r\ncontinents.\r\nThe Middle East is finally following the path of\r\ndialogue and understanding, through a peace process that\r\nwe firmly support and encourage. Angola and Mozambique\r\nare the new promises of southern Africa, furthering regional\r\npeace and conciliation as the South Africans have done.\r\nLatin America, and in particular the Southern Cone\r\ncountries, has continued to show vitality both at the\r\npolitical level, with democracy fully at work, and at the\r\neconomic level, with freedom and openness leading to the\r\nresumption of growth and the expansion of trade.\r\nThe United Nations has kept its role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A broader\r\nagenda for the remainder of this century is under\r\nconsideration. Positive initiatives are under way to ensure\r\nthat the Organization is capable of more effectively\r\npromoting peace and development. Reform of the system is\r\nalso due to make it more responsive to the challenges that\r\nlie ahead.\r\nThe promotion of civil liberties and the quest for\r\nequal rights among women and men, minorities and\r\nmajorities, weak and strong are shaping the debate,\r\nguiding action and strengthening citizenship all over the\r\nworld.\r\nThese are indeed times of positive change. But even\r\nas one celebrates these positive trends, one is painfully\r\naware of the manifold threats posed by the persistence of\r\npoverty and violence in many areas of the world. The\r\nimages of the former Yugoslavia are living proof of past\r\nfailures and present challenges and misperceptions. They\r\nremind us of how much needs to be done to fulfil the\r\npromises embodied in the United Nations Charter.\r\nExtreme poverty and unemployment emerge as\r\nperhaps the most pervasive of the international issues,\r\naffecting developed and developing countries alike,\r\ncorroding the social fabric while fostering extremism on\r\nthe part of individuals and engendering short-sighted\r\nsolutions on the part of governments.\r\nTerrorism, drug trafficking, organized crime,\r\nxenophobia and racism, ethnic cleansing, religious\r\nfanaticism and intolerance, and persistent violations of\r\nbasic human rights continue to afflict millions of human\r\nbeings. Misguided economic policies, financial\r\nspeculation and the volatility of capital flows threaten\r\nmarkets on a global scale. Emerging economies, striving\r\nto consolidate stability and the resumption of growth\r\nwhile dealing with variables such as interest rates and\r\ncommodity prices, have become increasingly vulnerable.\r\nDisarmament continues to be an elusive goal. The\r\npromises heralded by the end of the cold war seem to\r\nhave vanished in a cloud of vague excuses. The so-called\r\npeace dividends have yet to materialize. The world is\r\ntheoretically less threatening and dangerous.\r\nCompetitiveness, technological capability, economic\r\nstrength and social indicators have become the standards\r\nof national power. Yet, more positive moves in\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation have been offset by\r\nanachronistic economic practices and irresponsible\r\nmilitary endeavours.\r\nSome countries continue to seek military strength\r\nand strategic power. Even as commitment to\r\nnon-proliferation and support for nuclear disarmament\r\ngain ground in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia,\r\nnuclear tests painfully remind us of the threats and\r\nhorrors that haunted the collective imagination during the\r\ncold-war years. Besides endangering the environment they\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nencourage the resumption of a purposeless arms race in\r\nvarious parts of the world.\r\nNuclear testing undermines efforts towards\r\ndisarmament and jeopardizes the conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test ban. Instead of helping the\r\ninternational community strengthen collective security\r\nmechanisms, certain countries persist in testing and\r\nimproving their nuclear arsenals. We deplore it.\r\nSo where does the United Nations stand in the current\r\ninternational scene? How can it deal with the conflicting\r\nand ambivalent forces operating in the world today? Where\r\ndoes its responsibility begin and where does it end? What\r\ncan we do to realize the vision of our founding fathers?\r\nThese are some of the questions that come to mind as we\r\nprepare to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is certainly true that the Organization may have\r\nseemed at times to be overwhelmed by the challenges\r\nbefore it. But it is also true that the shortcomings over these\r\npast 50 years would have been greater had it not been for\r\nthe United Nations, a universal conscience, an instrument\r\nfor peace and understanding, as no other instrument has\r\never been, with a moral authority that the peoples of the\r\nworld have learned to recognize and support.\r\nIn 1941 when the United Nations was but a distant\r\ndream overcast by war, Franklin Delano Roosevelt defined\r\nthe four freedoms upon which a true community of nations\r\nshould be built. They were — and I find it useful to recall\r\nRoosevelt’s own inspiring words — the freedom of speech\r\nand expression; the freedom of every person to worship\r\nGod in his own way; the freedom from want, which\r\n“translated into world terms, means economic\r\nunderstandings which will secure to every nation a\r\nhealthy peace time life for its inhabitants”;\r\nand the freedom from fear, which\r\n“translated into world terms, means a world-wide\r\nreduction of armaments to such a point and in such a\r\nthorough fashion that no nation will be in a position\r\nto commit an act of physical aggression against any\r\nneighbor”.\r\nProviding mankind with these four freedoms was the\r\nchallenge that ultimately gave birth to the United Nations.\r\nYet, these four freedoms are still largely unattained. They\r\nremain an inspiration and a goal.\r\nIn the past 50 years, the nations of the world have\r\nused this podium to voice their hopes and concerns and\r\nto express their feelings about a true international\r\npartnership based on peace and prosperity. The United\r\nNations has undoubtedly represented a call for consensus,\r\na moral and ethic force, a promoter of political will and\r\naction, a substitute for confrontation and dispute.\r\nThe time has come for us to carefully assess the\r\nachievements and shortcomings of the United Nations in\r\norder to set the course for the next half-century. The time\r\nhas come for us to create the conditions for the United\r\nNations of the twenty-first century.\r\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War the idea\r\nof an international body such as the United Nations may\r\nhave seemed utopian, especially in the light of the failure\r\nof the League of Nations and of the tragedies and crimes\r\nthat resulted from the pursuit of power politics, the kind\r\nof politics that led the world into war and its horrors.\r\nWhile avoiding utopianism, the United Nations was\r\ndesigned to provide actual instruments of diplomatic\r\ninteraction capable of replacing power politics by ethical\r\nvalues and of promoting conflict prevention and conflict\r\nresolution through negotiation and dialogue.\r\nWith a pledge to peace and security on the one hand\r\nand to development on the other, the United Nations\r\nhelped to write important chapters of contemporary\r\nhistory, such as the building of a new pattern of\r\nrelationship between developed and developing countries,\r\nthe search for development, disarmament, the protection\r\nof human rights and human dignity, decolonization, the\r\nstruggle against apartheid and the condemnation of\r\ntyranny and oppression.\r\nIn this process important organizations such as the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), and decisive forums such as the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\n(UNCED), and the several other United Nations\r\nconferences dedicated to global issues, have played a\r\nparamount role. In these forums we have enhanced\r\ncommitments in the areas of cooperation for development,\r\nthe law of the sea, the rights of children, the environment\r\nand sustainable development, human rights, population,\r\nsocial development and the rights of women.\r\nWe have certainly accomplished one part of our\r\ndreams. So why not set our eyes on further\r\naccomplishments? We look at the recent past and find the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nUnited Nations at the centre of the most important\r\ninternational events. Even when its action has been\r\nconstrained by circumstances, the United Nations always\r\ndisplayed moral strength. We look at the present and we\r\nsee a United Nations limited by its structure, struggling\r\nvery hard to take advantage of its own experience to adapt\r\nto changing world realities in order to remain the foremost\r\ninternational force.\r\nAnd so Brazil confidently looks to the future. Peace\r\nand development in the years to come will depend largely\r\non our capacity to renew and reform the United Nations. In\r\ninstitutions, as in human beings, reassessment and reform\r\nare a sign of vitality, of maturity, of responsibility. As\r\nBrazil has already pointed out a normative gap has opened\r\nup between some of the provisions of the Charter and the\r\nrealities of today’s world.\r\nThe fact is that most of the structures of the United\r\nNations remain those crafted 50 years ago. Back then, the\r\nworld was entering a new phase of power politics and\r\nconfrontation that no longer applies. The membership of the\r\nUnited Nations was less than one third of what it is today.\r\nThe concept of development was not at the core of an\r\ninternational agenda. Significant players in the developed\r\nand in the developing world had yet to achieve the\r\ninfluential role they have today.\r\nNew realities demand innovative solutions. Greater\r\nexpectations require stronger commitments. Nothing is more\r\nemblematic of the need to bring the United Nations into\r\nline with the realities of the post-cold-war world than the\r\nreform of the Security Council. As a catalyst for other\r\nmuch-needed reforms within the United Nations system,\r\nreform of the Security Council is an imperative that should\r\nno longer be put off.\r\nIn order to carry out its mandate in the field of\r\ninternational peace and security on behalf of all Member\r\nStates, the Security Council must have unquestionable\r\nlegitimacy. As is well known, legitimacy ultimately rests on\r\nrepresentativeness.\r\nReform cannot entail a wholesale or indiscriminate\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, much less an\r\ninsufficient one predicated on the convenience of a limited\r\nnumber of States. Above all, it will be essential to ensure\r\na more equitable representation of developed and\r\ndeveloping countries with both the capacity to act and an\r\neffective presence on a global scale.\r\nThe emergence of new economic powers and of a\r\nnumber of developing countries with global projection has\r\nsignificantly altered the dynamics of world politics. These\r\nplayers have come to the forefront of the international\r\nscene and should be present in the core group of\r\npermanent members, so that the Council’s composition\r\nbecomes more balanced and better reflects the diversity of\r\nworld views.\r\nA qualitative increase in the number of permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, together with an\r\nenlargement of the non-permanent membership, would\r\ncorrespond to the necessity of making it more\r\nauthoritative and efficient in carrying out its increased\r\nresponsibilities in the post-cold-war era.\r\nReform is not about the individual prestige of any\r\ncountry but about the prestige of the Security Council\r\nitself. Brazil, for its part, is ready to assume its\r\nresponsibilities in this endeavour.\r\nThe same attention that is being given to improving\r\nthe United Nations performance in the area of peace and\r\nsecurity must be given to efforts in the area of\r\nstrengthening international cooperation for development.\r\nPoverty and unemployment both in industrialized and in\r\ndeveloping nations, economic instability and misguided\r\neconomic policies affecting individual countries, as well\r\nas the persistence or the rise of various forms of\r\nprotectionism, are factors that adversely affect sustained\r\ngrowth worldwide. These are issues that must be accorded\r\nhigh priority.\r\nUnemployment cannot be used as a pretext that will\r\nultimately lead to protectionism directed mainly against\r\nthe developing countries. There is no use in trying to\r\nalleviate unemployment by accusing other people, by\r\ncreating new forms of disguised protectionism, by putting\r\na new strain on international relations. We must\r\nstrengthen the role of the World Trade Organization as\r\nthe mainstay of an open and non-discriminatory\r\nmultilateral trade system. We must promote a broader\r\ncoordination of macroeconomic policies and foster\r\nregional economic integration, and provide better and\r\nmore effective cooperation in the areas of health,\r\nsanitation, education, the administration of justice and\r\nother areas of great social impact. We must widen the\r\ndecision-making circles in order to include countries\r\nwhose contribution to these objectives can be\r\ninstrumental.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nThe United Nations should be able to ensure\r\nimplementation of the commitments reached at the highest\r\nlevel at the United Nations Conference on the Environment\r\nand Development, for much needs to be done to fulfil the\r\npromises that were made in Rio de Janeiro regarding\r\ninternational cooperation for sustainable development. The\r\nsame kind of follow-up should apply to the commitments\r\nreached at subsequent international conferences on global\r\nissues.\r\nThese are the main goals to be achieved by a reform\r\nof the United Nations institutions that directly or indirectly\r\ndeal with the issue of sustainable development. We firmly\r\nbelieve that a broad vision of reform of the United Nations\r\ninstitutions will lead to an improved, more efficient and\r\nrevitalized Organization. For, as once stated in this very\r\nforum by a distinguished Brazilian statesman, Oswaldo\r\nAranha, who presided over the first special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in 1947:\r\n“Above all, it is within our power to make the United\r\nNations the sum total of justice, security and peace, or\r\nthrough our lack of wisdom to allow it to be\r\ntransformed into one more sword to be wielded\r\nblindly by force and instinct.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, First Special Session, 68th plenary\r\nmeeting, pp. 3 and 4)\r\nThe United Nations will stand as the greatest symbol\r\nof the twentieth century as long as it is able to keep its\r\nvitality and effectively promote peace and development.\r\nBrazil is also committed to peace and democracy and\r\nbelieves that if all peoples of the world are free to express\r\ntheir ideas and to build their own destinies, democracy will\r\nbe strengthened and will continue to serve the purpose of\r\ndevelopment and social justice. Brazil is also committed to,\r\nand knows that development depends on, an international\r\nenvironment of peace, cooperation and economic freedom.\r\nAs our Heads of State and Government prepare to\r\ngather in New York in October to celebrate the\r\naccomplishments of our Organization, let us hasten to\r\ncreate the necessary conditions for them to build for the\r\nfuture with the same impetus and boldness that inspired the\r\ninternational community 50 years ago. Let us make sure\r\nthat through our unfaltering commitment and our timely\r\naction the United Nations will emerge stronger from the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Tunisia, His Excellency Mr. Habib Ben Yahia.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): Allow me at the outset to extend to you,\r\nMr. President, our warmest and sincerest congratulations\r\non your election to the presidency of the fiftieth session\r\nof the United Nations General Assembly. Through you, I\r\nshould also like to pay tribute to the relations between my\r\ncountry and Portugal and to note our shared expectations\r\nfor the Mediterranean region.\r\nI would be remiss were I to fail to extend my\r\nwarmest congratulations to your predecessor, Mr. Amara\r\nEssy, President of the previous session of the Assembly,\r\nfor the new impetus he gave to the Organization through\r\nthe different working groups over which he presided. I\r\nshould also like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the wisdom and\r\ndetermination with which he is carrying out his noble\r\nmission.\r\nThis session of the Assembly crowns a half century\r\nof the world Organization’s efforts to preserve world\r\npeace. Today, the Organization is called upon to pave the\r\nway to a new era, one that we hope will be marked by\r\nsolidarity in facing the tasks before us and the\r\nresponsibility we all bear.\r\nSince the end of the cold war the world has rid itself\r\nof the heavy burden of the fear of another world war, a\r\nwar that would have led to untold catastrophes and\r\ntragedies. This development, albeit new, already seems to\r\nbe part of the past given the speed of subsequent\r\ndevelopments.\r\nEven if East-West confrontation and the bipolarity of\r\npast decades have disappeared, new challenges have\r\nemerged over the past few years. Hotbeds of tension and\r\ninstability have proliferated, in many regions of the world,\r\nand have taken root in the soil of ethnic and political\r\nhostilities that often take the form of armed confrontations\r\nwithin the borders of any one State. Such hostilities are\r\noften fuelled by extremes of hardship and by deteriorating\r\neconomic and social conditions.\r\nSome negative phenomena, such as terrorism,\r\nextremism and the illicit traffic in arms and drugs have\r\nalso grown in a manner that is cause for concern as they\r\nundermine the stability of States.\r\nInherent in these new challenges are factors of\r\ndisintegration and collapse that throw a long shadow over\r\ninternational peace and security and impose new threats\r\nthat the international community should hasten to contain\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nwith decisive action which should not focus on their\r\noutward manifestations alone, but deal with their true\r\nunderlying causes, namely economic underdevelopment and\r\nsocial backwardness.\r\nIn fact, these new situations which now face the world\r\nin the post-cold-war era make us realize that it is\r\nimpossible to ensure lasting international peace and security\r\nby military means alone. Respect for law and international\r\nlegality are prerequisites as are creation of conditions that\r\nwould promote the economic and social development in an\r\ninterdependent world. These, we believe, are the\r\nunderpinnings upon which we should build a new world\r\norder.\r\nDue to the developments the international community\r\nhas been witnessing over the past few years, the United\r\nNations Organization has come to shoulder new\r\nresponsibilities towards international peace and security.\r\nThese responsibilities are manifest in the unprecedented\r\nincrease in the number of peace-keeping operations, as well\r\nas in new activities such as the supervision of elections and\r\nthe rebuilding of State structures and the economic\r\ninfrastructures of States. In addition, many of these\r\nactivities have to do with the settlement of disputes within\r\ncertain States.\r\nWhile the United Nations has to provide assistance to\r\ncountries that are ravaged by civil wars and internal\r\nconflicts, we, as members of the international community,\r\nare all called upon to mobilize our efforts and to strengthen\r\nour solidarity within the context of the efforts aimed at the\r\nmaintenance of peace and to identify and resolve the\r\nunderlying causes of such disputes. Proceeding from our\r\nbelief in the fundamental principles set forth in the\r\nSecretary-General’s “Agenda for Peace”, particularly those\r\nrelating to preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace\r\nbuilding, Tunisia, during its presidency of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU), called for stronger cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity in the area of conflict prevention and the speedy\r\nresolution of disputes at minimum cost.\r\nHere we should remind of the role of the central organ\r\nof the OAU’s mechanism for conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution, which has been given new\r\nimpetus by President Ben Ali and other African leaders in\r\norder to make it an effective tool in the prevention and\r\nsettlement of disputes in Africa.\r\nIn this context, Tunisia has hosted several meetings of\r\nthis central body, which have resulted in the adoption of\r\nmany important resolutions that have made it possible to\r\naddress certain situations which, otherwise, would have\r\ncalled for intervention by the international community to\r\nkeep peace or to prevent the outbreak of new conflicts.\r\nWe believe that such efforts by this central organ of the\r\nOAU warrant additional support. The results of such\r\nefforts could be improved if the appropriate financial and\r\nlogistical means were made available to the organ and if\r\ncoordination were ensured between the United Nations\r\nand the OAU in this regard. We do hope that the recent\r\ntendency to give this matter some thought will lead to the\r\nidentification of the ways and means whereby action by\r\nthe international community in this direction will develop\r\nfurther. On this occasion, I should like, on behalf of\r\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, to pay tribute to the\r\ninternational community for its valuable support to\r\nTunisia during its presidency of the OAU, and to express\r\nparticular appreciation to the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as well as to\r\nall those who have provided financial and logistical\r\nassistance to peace-keeping operations in Africa and to\r\nthe States that have provided financial support to the fund\r\ncreated within the OAU mechanism for the settlement,\r\nmanagement and prevention of disputes.\r\nWhile some hotbeds of tension persist, some have\r\nbeen eliminated, and we do see a reduction in the danger\r\nof major conflagrations in the light of the significant\r\nprogress made towards disarmament and the strengthening\r\nof the underpinnings of international security through the\r\nefforts of the United Nations, as well as an improvement\r\nin the climate of trust and understanding that we now feel\r\nin international relations.\r\nIn the area of weapons of mass destruction, Tunisia\r\nwelcomed the signing of the Convention on chemical\r\nweapons. We believe it is a step that will lead to the\r\nelimination of an entire class of such weapons. This calls\r\nfor further substantive steps to rid the world gradually of\r\nthe threat of nuclear weapons, particularly in the wake of\r\nthe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nAs for the Middle East, many important steps have\r\nbeen taken towards genuine dialogue between the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\nTunisia, which has been an active participant in the\r\npeace process since it began in Madrid, welcomes the\r\nagreement achieved yesterday between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and Israel, and hopes that it will\r\nbe followed by other concrete steps towards ensuring the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nachievement of the legitimate national rights of the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nWe must adopt the same approach in order to give\r\nnew impetus to the negotiations between Syria and Israel on\r\nthe one hand, and between Lebanon and Israel on the other\r\nin order to ensure the withdrawal from the occupied\r\nterritories in the Golan and in southern Lebanon and the\r\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\r\nthe region.\r\nIt goes without saying that the principles upon which\r\nthe peace process was based, namely Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well as General\r\nAssembly resolutions concerning the withdrawal from all\r\nArab and Palestinian lands, including Holy Al-Quds, must\r\nbe fully implemented. Al-Quds remains, for the Palestinian\r\nand the whole Islamic nation, a cornerstone for the\r\nsettlement of the dispute.\r\nWe believe that it is time for the Israeli Government\r\nto demonstrate realism and political courage by rising above\r\nthe very narrow view of security and relations with the\r\nneighbouring Arab States in order to allow the peoples of\r\nthe region to live in harmony in increasing security and\r\nstability.\r\nIn the Arab Maghreb, Tunisia, which has always\r\nbelieved in international legality, calls, in the light of\r\ninitiatives taken by Libya, for a rapid resolution of the\r\nLockerbie affair in order to lift the embargo imposed on\r\nour Libyan brethren. The negative effects of that embargo\r\nhave begun seriously to affect stability and development in\r\nall the countries of the region.\r\nAs for Iraq, Tunisia, which is satisfied with the\r\nprogress that is being made in implementing United Nations\r\nresolutions, calls for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq in\r\norder to mitigate the suffering of the Iraqi people. At the\r\nsame time, Tunisia stresses the need to fully respect the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait and all the\r\ncountries of the region. By the same token, we hope that\r\nagreement on the basis of the norms of international law\r\nand the behests of good-neighbourliness and respect for the\r\nterritorial integrity of other States, will be reached in the\r\ndispute between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran on Abu Moussa and the Greater and\r\nLesser Tumb Islands.\r\nI should now like to address the crisis in Bosnia,\r\nwhich, in our view, constitutes an aberration that embodies\r\na serious defiance to all humanity. This war puts us face to\r\nface with ideologies which, we thought, had become\r\nthings of the past, but which have now resurfaced in the\r\nguise of “ethnic cleansing”. The international community\r\nhas the right to make use of the means provided by the\r\nUnited Nations Charter to force those who flout all\r\ncivilized values and trample the most basic of human\r\nrights to accept the independence of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and to respect its territorial integrity.\r\nTunisia, which has always participated in the United\r\nNations efforts to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity, is well-aware of the limitations of the narrow\r\nview that reduces the concept of security to the military\r\ndimension alone. Proceeding from this, Tunisia has\r\nsupported from the outset the international community’s\r\ninitiative embodied in “An Agenda for Development”. We\r\nbelieve that “An Agenda for Development”, along with\r\n“An Agenda for Peace”, help to enrich our thinking in the\r\nfield of multilateral cooperation at a time when countries\r\nof the world are becoming increasingly open to market\r\neconomics which, together with the consolidation of\r\ninterdependence, have come to be the principal economic\r\ncharacteristics of world economy at the end of the 20th\r\ncentury.\r\nIn view of the irreversible globalization of economic\r\nconcepts, the United Nations is called upon to play a\r\nfundamental role in formulating and implementing\r\ndevelopment policies. Such an important role should work\r\nin favour of the international community’s efforts to\r\nrestructure the United Nations and to increase its\r\neffectiveness. Tunisia, which has taken part in these\r\nefforts, believes that any restructuring process should help\r\npromote the universal nature of the Organization and\r\nstrengthen its democratic posture, so that it may make a\r\nbetter contribution in the area of development. We believe\r\nthat the process of restructuring must go hand-in-hand\r\nwith a wider cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions in order to improve their\r\ninput in development.\r\nIn this context, joint initiatives could be taken to\r\nensure a better division of labour between the United\r\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions with a view\r\nto increasing their effectiveness in the economic and\r\nsocial fields and within the context of development in\r\ngeneral. More specifically, as far as cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and other parties is concerned,\r\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has been calling, since\r\n1989, from this very rostrum, for a development\r\npartnership between industrialized and developing\r\ncountries. This initiative is a project for a new\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ninternational cooperation based on a dynamic view of the\r\nsecurity of all States. Through this proposal, Tunisia aims\r\nat creating a new system based on economic, political,\r\nsocial and democratic stability, because we believe that they\r\nare the very pillars of security. This Tunisian initiative is\r\nbased on awareness of the organic link between\r\ndevelopment, democracy and stability. This overall view\r\ntakes into account the aspirations of individuals and peoples\r\nwho look forward to freedom and economic, social and\r\ncultural well-being.\r\nThe Tunisian view of security and development is\r\nanchored in the belief that extreme importance must be\r\nattached to the cultural and humanitarian aspects of\r\ninternational relations, particularly at the regional level.\r\nProceeding from this belief, Tunisia has sought to\r\nconsolidate its cultural and political ties with all the\r\ncountries of the Arab Maghreb and of the Mediterranean.\r\nAt the Maghreb level, in cooperation with the member\r\nStates of the Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia has worked to\r\ncreate an economic zone in the region. This has taken\r\nconcrete shape in the Tunisian declaration of 1994 relating\r\nto the creation of a free zone as a first step in putting in\r\nplace a Maghreb development strategy.\r\nTunisia’s involvement in international economic affairs\r\nand its attempts to develop its interests with the region on\r\nthe northern shores of the Mediterranean are among its\r\nbasic foreign-policy tenets, enshrined in the partnership\r\nagreement with the European Union. This agreement is\r\nbased on joint development and aims at creating a free zone\r\nthat will allow Tunisia further activity within the economies\r\nof its European partners. It goes hand in hand with a policy\r\nof dialogue between the countries of the Mediterranean. On\r\nthe 28th and 29th of July 1995, Tunisia hosted a\r\npreparatory meeting for the Mediterranean region to ensure\r\nthe success of the meeting scheduled for next November in\r\nBarcelona. The Preliminary results of the Mediterranean\r\ndialogue give cause for optimism as they reflect a common\r\ndesire to safeguard the Mediterranean region from\r\ninternational political convulsions and economic fluctuations\r\nwhile ensuring its harmonious development.\r\nThe United Nations is called upon today to develop a\r\nnew concept based on the need to achieve security,\r\ndevelopment and democracy. These are the very principles\r\nin which Tunisia believes and for which we strive,\r\ndomestically as well as internationally. In the field of\r\ndevelopment, the Tunisian strategy is based on the human\r\nelement within a comprehensive vision that embraces all\r\nsegments of society, and aims at building a balanced and\r\nunitary society.\r\nIn this context, I wish to stress in particular the\r\nimportance that Tunisia attaches to the empowerment of\r\nwomen, the protection of the family and to highlight the\r\nfact that many achievements have been made in this\r\ncontext, particularly with regard to the adoption of\r\nstructural, legal and administrative measures to promote\r\nthe role of women and the family, economically and\r\nsocially and to enhance the role of women in our\r\ndevelopment efforts. At the same time, Tunisia has\r\nacceded to many international conventions on the equality\r\nof women and men, the latest of which has been the\r\nCopenhagen agreement which relate to the elimination of\r\nall forms of discrimination against women. Based on its\r\nrich experience in this context, Tunisia has played a very\r\nactive role in the March 1995 World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and in the recent Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing, whose positive\r\nresults we commend.\r\nIn this new era, Tunisia will continue to support the\r\nefforts of the United Nations both in the areas of\r\nmaintenance of peace and of development. We shall\r\ncontinue to participate in defining the features of the new\r\nworld order and to call for upholding the law and the\r\nnorms of international legality. It behoves the States of\r\nthe world to share a joint vision of the world of\r\ntomorrow, so that it may be characterized by more\r\nsolidarity and justice. We hope that the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will reaffirm the\r\ncommitment of the international community to an\r\nOrganization without which we can never hope to build\r\nsuch a new world order.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Secretary of State\r\nof the United States of America, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Warren Christopher.\r\nMr. Christopher (United States of America): It is\r\na privilege to speak to the General Assembly today on\r\nbehalf of the United States.\r\nA half-century ago the General Assembly first met\r\nhere in New York, across the river in a converted skating\r\nrink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundings\r\nour predecessors began to put in place an ambitious\r\nframework that they hoped would keep the peace as\r\nsuccessfully as they had prosecuted the war.\r\nIn the years since, the United Nations has helped\r\nbring peace, prosperity and hope to countless people\r\naround the world. Technological change has brought\r\nnations closer together than the founders of the United\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nNations could possibly have foreseen. The United Nations\r\nitself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had to\r\nmanage complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars\r\nto mass movements of refugees to health epidemics. This\r\nevolution has placed great strains on the Organization and\r\nhas revealed the necessity for far-reaching changes in how\r\nit is run.\r\nThe Clinton Administration has vigorously made the\r\ncase to our Congress and our people for continued\r\nAmerican leadership at the United Nations. The United\r\nStates made a commitment to the United Nations Charter\r\n50 years ago, and we are determined to keep our\r\ncommitment, including our financial obligations.\r\nWe will always remember that for millions of people\r\naround the world, the United Nations is far from a faceless\r\ninstitution. It is, as Harry Truman once said,\r\n“a case of food, a box of school books; it is a doctor\r\nwho vaccinates children; it is an expert who shows\r\npeople how to raise more rice and more wheat.”\r\nTo millions more around the world, it is the difference\r\nbetween peace and war.\r\nEconomic and social development, as well as the\r\nprotection of human rights, remain central to the United\r\nNations mission. But the United Nations must change to\r\nmeet new needs more effectively. When money is wasted\r\nin New York, Geneva or Vienna, when time is lost in\r\nbureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price are those\r\nmost vulnerable to famine, disease and violence.\r\nIt is time to recognize that the United Nations must\r\ndirect its limited resources to the world’s highest priorities,\r\nfocusing on the tasks that it performs the best. The United\r\nNations bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear\r\norganizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility.\r\nEach programme must be held to a single simple standard:\r\nit must make a tangible contribution to the freedom,\r\nsecurity and well-being of real people in the real world.\r\nIn the last year, under the leadership of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial\r\nchange has been laid. The United Nations has an office\r\nwith the functions of an inspector general and a mandate to\r\ncrack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-General\r\nJoe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign to\r\nimprove the United Nations management culture, and we\r\nfully support his good work. The United Nations Secretariat\r\nhas moved in the right direction by submitting a budget that\r\nbegins to restrain spending, and now this momentum for\r\nreform must accelerate.\r\nLet me propose a brief, concrete agenda for reform.\r\nFirst, we must end United Nations programmes that\r\nhave achieved their purpose, and we must consolidate\r\nprogrammes that overlap, especially in the economic and\r\nsocial agencies. The United Nations has more than a\r\ndozen organizations responsible for development,\r\nemergency response and statistical reporting. We should\r\nconsider establishing a single agency for each of these\r\nfunctions. We should downsize the United Nations\r\nregional economic commissions. We should ensure that\r\nthe functions of the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development do not duplicate those of the new\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), and we should adopt\r\na moratorium on big United Nations conferences once the\r\npresent series is completed, concentrating instead on\r\nmeeting the commitments of those conferences that we\r\nhave already held.\r\nSecondly, we need to streamline the United Nations\r\nSecretariat to make it more efficient, accountable and\r\ntransparent. Each part of the United Nations system\r\nshould be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general.\r\nThe United Nations must not tolerate ethical or financial\r\nabuses, and its managers should be appointed and\r\npromoted on the basis of merit.\r\nThirdly, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals\r\nfor new and extended peace-keeping missions, and we\r\nshould improve the United Nations ability to respond\r\nrapidly when new missions are approved. We must agree\r\non an equitable scale of peace-keeping assessments that\r\nreflects fully today’s economic realities. And we should\r\nhave a unified budget for peace-keeping operations.\r\nFinally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council. Germany and Japan should become\r\npermanent members, and we should ensure that all the\r\nworld’s regions are fairly represented, without making the\r\nCouncil too large and unwieldy.\r\nWe welcome the formation of the high-level group\r\non reform, initiated under the leadership of the outgoing\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Essy. Our goal\r\nmust be that of a practical blueprint for United Nations\r\nreform and to ensure that it is adopted before the General\r\nAssembly finishes the work of its fiftieth session next\r\nfall. The way forward is clear; we have already seen and\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nstudied countless studies and reports. Now the time has\r\ncome to act on the best proposals.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, in my country there have\r\nbeen serious efforts to curtail our support for the United\r\nNations. The President and I, and our entire Administration,\r\nbelieve it would be reckless to turn away from an\r\nOrganization that helps mobilize the support of other\r\nnations for goals that are consistent with American and\r\nglobal interests. But to sustain support for the United\r\nNations among the American people and among the people\r\nof other nations, it is not enough that we defend the\r\ninstitution. The best argument against retreat is further\r\nreform. Tangible progress in that direction will help us win\r\nthe battle for United Nations support that we are waging in\r\nthe United States.\r\nThe United Nations must emerge from the reform\r\nprocess better able to meet its fundamental goals, including\r\nthe preservation of peace and security. From Korea to the\r\nPersian Gulf to Haiti, the United Nations has provided a\r\nmandate to its Members as they carried out their\r\nresponsibilities. The United Nations own Blue Helmets\r\nhave helped nations create the basic conditions of peace in\r\nsome of the most difficult situations imaginable around the\r\nworld, even though they have not always achieved their\r\nintended purpose.\r\nRecently, a young Haitian father was asked what the\r\npeace-keeping forces had achieved in his country. He\r\nanswered,\r\n“We walk freely. We sleep quietly. There are no\r\nmen who come for us in the night.”\r\nIn Haiti, as, for example, in Cambodia, Mozambique and El\r\nSalvador, the United Nations has shown that peace-keeping,\r\ndespite its limitations, has been an enormously useful\r\ninstrument.\r\nOne region where United Nations forces and the\r\ninternational community have played a critical role is the\r\nMiddle East. Another historic milestone will be marked this\r\nThursday, in Washington, when Israel and the Palestinians\r\nsign their agreement to implement phase two of the\r\nDeclaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to life\r\na goal first set many years ago in the Camp David accords:\r\nto protect Israel’s security and to give Palestinians\r\nthroughout the West Bank control over their daily lives.\r\nThe international community and the United Nations must\r\ncontinue to support this process, both diplomatically and\r\neconomically.\r\nThere is no question that the United Nations has\r\nnever undertaken a mission more difficult than the one in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission are\r\nall too well known, but we all must recognize that it has\r\nprovided relief for hundreds of thousands of people and\r\nhas saved literally thousands of lives. Today, diplomacy\r\nbacked by force has given the United States and the\r\ninternational community an opportunity to move forward\r\non a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. The\r\nUnited Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) are working effectively together to\r\ntry to bring peace to the region. On 8 September in\r\nGeneva, the parties to the conflict accepted the\r\nfundamental goal that the Security Council has often\r\nexpressed: the continuation of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina as a single State within its internationally\r\nrecognized borders. I will be meeting with the Foreign\r\nMinisters of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia later today, and\r\nat that time I will urge them — implore them — to\r\nmaintain the momentum towards peace and to establish\r\nconstitutional structures for Bosnia.\r\nThe framers of the Charter of the United Nations\r\ncreated this institution to meet threats to peace and\r\nsecurity posed by aggression and armed conflict. Those\r\nthreats are still, unfortunately, very much with us. But\r\ntoday, the world also faces a new set of security\r\nchallenges, including proliferation, terrorism, international\r\ncrime and narcotics, as well as the far-reaching\r\nconsequences of damage to the environment. These have\r\nassumed a new and dangerous scope in a more\r\ninterdependent world. As President Clinton said in San\r\nFrancisco in June, the\r\n“new forces of integration carry within them the\r\nseeds of disintegration and destruction”.\r\nWhile, as I said earlier, new technologies have\r\nbrought us closer together, they also have made it easier\r\nfor terrorists, drug dealers and other international\r\ncriminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction, to set\r\nup cocaine cartels and to hide their ill-gotten gains. The\r\ncollapse of communism has shattered dictatorships, to be\r\nsure, but it has also left the political and legal institutions\r\nof newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to those\r\nwho seek to subvert them.\r\nAlthough these threats are sometimes sponsored by\r\nStates, they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must\r\nvigorously fight these enemies on our own, but we will\r\nnever be truly secure until we effectively fight them\r\ntogether. That is the new security challenge for the global\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ncommunity, and it must be the new security mission for the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThere is no single area in which the United Nations\r\ncan make a more significant contribution than in that of\r\nnon-proliferation. Fifty years ago, the United States was the\r\nonly country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Today\r\nmany countries have the technology that would enable them\r\nto turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb as\r\nsmall as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170\r\nnations agreed, at a conference held here last May and\r\neffectively chaired by Ambassador Dhanapala, to extend for\r\nall time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons. That is an achievement we must rejoice in but\r\nalso build on.\r\nI should like to outline some steps in the field of\r\nnon-proliferation. First, we should have a comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty ready for signature by the time we meet here\r\nnext September. As President Clinton announced last\r\nmonth, the United States is committed to a true zero-yield\r\ntest ban. We urge other nations to join us in that\r\ncommitment.\r\nSecondly, we should immediately start negotiations on\r\na fissile material cut-off treaty. Those who have been most\r\nvocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize\r\nthat it is essential to ban future production of fissile\r\nmaterial for nuclear weapons.\r\nThirdly, we should push forward with the historic\r\nreductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and\r\ncountries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the United\r\nStates Senate, as well as on the Russian Duma, to approve\r\nthe treaty on further reduction and limitation of strategic\r\noffensive arms (START II) so that we can lock in deep cuts\r\nin our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents\r\nClinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure the\r\nsafety, transparency and irreversibility of nuclear-arms\r\nreductions.\r\nAs part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a\r\nnuclear safety and security summit in Moscow next spring.\r\nThis summit should have a very ambitious agenda,\r\nincluding a declaration of principles on nuclear safety. We\r\nlook to this summit to address the worldwide problems of\r\nnuclear-waste management, including those of ocean\r\ndumping. The summit should also promote a plan of action\r\nto safeguard nuclear materials, a plan that should include\r\nnew measures to prevent criminals and terrorists from\r\nacquiring nuclear materials for use in weapons.\r\nFinally, we should push for the earliest possible\r\nentry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nPresident Clinton has urged the United States Senate to\r\nact promptly on its ratification, and to stop holding the\r\nSTART II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\nhostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the\r\neffects of poison gas too many times in this century — on\r\nEuropean battlefields during the First World War, in\r\nEthiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s, and against\r\nIranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the\r\n1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make\r\nevery nation safer, and we need it now.\r\nThe United Nations is also playing an invaluable\r\nrole in focusing attention on pressing regional\r\nproliferation problems. In Iraq, the United Nations Special\r\nCommission (UNSCOM) and its Chairman, Rolf Ekeus,\r\ncontinue to uncover horrific details about Saddam\r\nHussein’s weapons of mass destruction.\r\nUnder Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly\r\nbiological-weapons capacity hidden from view. It was\r\nconducting research to turn some of the most toxic\r\nsubstances known to man into weapons of war. We know\r\nthat Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism in\r\nbombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, he\r\ndeployed these weapons, with every intention of using\r\nthem against the international coalition and innocent\r\ncivilians. He was dissuaded from doing so only by the\r\nsteadfast determination of the United States and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn the light of what Ambassador Ekeus has\r\nuncovered in Iraq, we can conclude only that for the last\r\nfour and a half years, Saddam Hussein has lied about the\r\nfull scope of Iraq’s weapons programmes. There should\r\nbe no easing of the sanctions regime against Iraq until its\r\nGovernment complies with all the demands of the\r\nSecurity Council and clearly demonstrates that it has\r\nchanged its ways.\r\nThe United Nations should also promote\r\nresponsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventional\r\nweapons. At last year’s session of the General Assembly,\r\nPresident Clinton proposed, and the Assembly approved,\r\nthe eventual elimination of anti-personnel mines. On my\r\nrecent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible damage these\r\nhidden killers can do. This year, we will again call on\r\nother countries to join us in putting an end to the export\r\nof land-mines.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nTwo years ago, President Clinton called on the\r\ninternational community to devise a true international\r\nsystem governing the transfer of conventional weapons and\r\nsensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the\r\nRussian Federation has joined with the United States and 26\r\nother countries to agree on a common principle to control\r\nthe build-up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to\r\nactivate this global regime, which is called the New Forum,\r\nby the end of this year.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons worldwide has added a\r\ndisturbing dimension to another threat we all face: the\r\nthreat of international terrorism. Indeed, this year’s sarin\r\ngas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happen\r\nwhen terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction.\r\nMore nations are joining the fight against those\r\nindividuals and groups that attack civilians for political\r\nends. The United Nations has supported this effort in\r\nimportant ways. The Security Council recognized the\r\nimportance of countering State-sponsored terrorism by\r\nimposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan\r\nAm 103 and UTA 772.\r\nTerrorists must be treated as criminals and there must\r\nbe no place where they can hide from the consequences of\r\ntheir acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full\r\nweight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international\r\ncommunity. Let us not deceive ourselves: every dollar that\r\ngoes into the Government coffers of a State-sponsor of\r\nterrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist’s bullets or\r\nbombs. Iran’s role as the foremost State-sponsor of\r\nterrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass\r\ndestruction even more alarming. We must stand together to\r\nprevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities.\r\nThe United States has taken a leading role in meeting\r\nthe international terrorist threat. We have intensified our\r\nsanctions against Iran. Last January President Clinton issued\r\nan Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions with\r\nterrorist groups and individuals that threaten the Middle\r\nEast peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten\r\nour immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the\r\nrun or put them behind bars.\r\nThe United States strongly supports the counter-\r\nterrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the\r\nHalifax Summit, and we expect the G-8 Ministerial Meeting\r\non Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete-action plan\r\nto implement these measures that were adopted at the\r\nHalifax Summit.\r\nOther kinds of international crime also threaten the\r\nsafety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And\r\nglobalization brings new and frightening dimensions to\r\ncrime. The threat of crime is a particular menace to\r\nyoung democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions,\r\npreys on the most vulnerable in our societies and\r\nundermines free-market reform.\r\nOf course, every country must take its own measures\r\nto combat these criminal threats. The Administration that\r\nI represent is now completing a review of our approach\r\nto transnational crime, a review that will lead to a\r\nstronger, more coordinated attack on this problem.\r\nTo help other States deal with criminal threats, the\r\nUnited States and Hungary have created the International\r\nLaw Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police\r\nofficers and law-enforcement officials from Central\r\nEurope and the States of the former Soviet Union. We are\r\nproviding similar help bilaterally, and through the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme, to those\r\ncountries whose laws are challenged by international drug\r\ncartels.\r\nA particularly insidious form of crime and corruption\r\nis money-laundering. All nations should work together to\r\nimplement the recommendations of the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to\r\nattack this insidious money-laundering. The nations of this\r\nhemisphere should also advance the anti-money-\r\nlaundering initiative introduced at last December’s\r\nSummit of the Americas. Together, we must work to\r\nsqueeze the dirty money out of the global financial\r\nsystem.\r\nThrough the United Nations conventions on drugs\r\nand crime the international community has set strong\r\nstandards that we must now act to enforce. We call on\r\nMember States which have not already joined the 1988\r\ndrug Convention to do so promptly, and we call on those\r\ncountries which have approved the Convention to move\r\nquickly to implement its important provisions.\r\nWe are also increasingly aware that damage to the\r\nenvironment and unsustainable population growth threaten\r\nthe security of our nations and the well-being of our\r\npeoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines,\r\ninfant mortality rates, refugee crises, and ozone depletion.\r\nIn places like Rwanda and Somalia, for example, they\r\ncontribute to civil wars and emergencies that can be\r\nresolved only by extremely costly international\r\nintervention. We must carry out the commitments we\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nmade last year at the Cairo Conference, as well as the\r\nimportant commitments made at the Rio Conference three\r\nyears ago.\r\nNever have our problems around the world been more\r\ncomplex. It has never been more evident that these\r\nproblems affect all nations, developed and developing alike.\r\nOnly by working together can we effectively deal with the\r\nnew threats we all face that I have outlined here today.\r\nThat is why in this fiftieth anniversary year we must\r\nshape the United Nations agenda as if we were creating the\r\ninstitution anew. Just as the founders of the United Nations\r\ndevised a new framework to deter aggression and armed\r\nconflict, the United Nations, in particular the Security\r\nCouncil, must now assign the same priority to combating\r\nthe threat posed by proliferation, by terrorism, by\r\ninternational crime, by narcotics and by environmental\r\npollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the United\r\nNations and elsewhere to turning our global consensus\r\nagainst these threats into concrete and effective action. We\r\nmust renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake,\r\nbut for our own.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Togo, His Excellency\r\nMr. Yandja Yentchabre.\r\nMr. Yentchabre (Togo) (interpretation from French):\r\nFifty years ago, learning the lessons of two world wars,\r\nwhich in the space of one human generation had brought\r\nunspeakable suffering to mankind, people of good will,\r\ndedicated to peace and justice and determined to preserve\r\nfuture generations from such horrors, founded the United\r\nNations. To ensure peace, justice and equality; to promote\r\ncollective security and peaceful coexistence; to encourage\r\neconomic and social progress for nations and peoples\r\nthrough international cooperation; to develop and promote\r\nrespect for the rights of man and of peoples, in greater\r\nfreedom and without discrimination: these, inter alia, were\r\nthe main objectives of the founders of the United Nations.\r\nWhat lofty goals! And now the time has come when\r\nwe have an opportunity to review what our common\r\nOrganization has achieved. This is a difficult but uplifting\r\ntask, and the big question is whether the objectives have\r\nbeen attained.\r\nBefore going any further, however, Sir, on behalf of\r\nthe President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency\r\nGeneral Gnassingbé Eyadema, and the Government and\r\npeople of Togo, and on my own behalf, I extend our\r\nwarmest congratulations on your magnificent election to\r\nthe important post of President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fiftieth session. The community of the United\r\nNations, in unanimously choosing you to lead our work\r\nat this historic session, pays tribute to you and to your\r\nqualities as an experienced diplomat and also pays a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to your beautiful country, Portugal, with\r\nwhich Togo is proud of having excellent and fruitful\r\nrelations of friendship and cooperation.\r\nWe also congratulate the other members of the\r\nGeneral Committee. In our view, their experience and\r\nyour mastery of international affairs augur well for the\r\nsuccess of our work. We assure you of the full\r\ncooperation of the Togolese delegation to that end.\r\nI should also like to extend the Togolese\r\nGovernment’s greatest appreciation to your distinguished\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire, who presided so adroitly\r\nand competently over the work of the forty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly. This honour done to his country\r\nand also to Africa is particularly encouraging. I should\r\nlike to say once again how sincerely we admire him.\r\nMr. Dembri (Algeria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI am also pleased to extend our warmest\r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his\r\ntireless and unending efforts to ensure that the United\r\nNations continues to flourish and to preserve peace and\r\nsecurity in the world.\r\nThis session is an event in itself, coinciding as it\r\ndoes with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. A half century has\r\npassed, and the various events that have marked the life\r\nof the Organization have altered neither the purposes nor\r\nthe principles of its Charter, which must preserve all its\r\nvitality and continue to be the legal and moral basis for\r\npresent-day international relations.\r\nMy delegation would like to pay a tribute to all\r\nthose whose imagination, creative spirit and intelligence\r\nled to the drafting of the provisions of the 111 Articles of\r\nthe Charter. Their knowledge and ability helped to\r\npreserve the world from a third world war, which, in this\r\nage of increasingly devastating nuclear weapons, would\r\nhave been fatal to the entire world, including the owners\r\nof the weapons.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nIn its daily search to ensure the wellbeing of peoples,\r\nthe Organization has adopted and implemented strategies to\r\nrespond to world concerns. In this connection, the Agenda\r\nfor Peace and the forthcoming Agenda for Development\r\nbear witness to the United Nations resolve to realize its\r\nnoble ideals.\r\nMy delegation believes that the fiftieth session should\r\ngive serious consideration to the ways to work out the new\r\napproaches that are needed if the Organization is to go\r\nforward on solid and increasingly coherent bases in its\r\nsearch for viable and lasting solutions to problems of peace,\r\nsecurity and development that pose a daily challenge to the\r\ninternational community. What is important at this session\r\nis the lessons we can learn from United Nations activities\r\nover the past 50 years that will help us to deal with the\r\nenormous challenges the third millennium will bring us.\r\nThe aspirations of peoples to participate even more\r\nactively in the management of world affairs is evident in\r\nevery country. My country, like so many others on the\r\nAfrican continent, has been buffeted by the winds of\r\nfreedom and democracy. After more than three turbulent\r\nyears fraught with misunderstandings among our national\r\npolitical figures concerning the stakes involved in\r\ndemocratization, Togo has now completed its transitional\r\nperiod towards democracy and the multiparty system. This\r\nsession affords me an opportunity to say that Togo has\r\nregained its stability and its customary peace and quiet and\r\nthat our Government is now actively working to strengthen\r\nthe bases for a State of law.\r\nEager to promote national unity, the Togolese\r\nauthorities are continuing to take all possible steps to\r\nestablish a climate of peace, fraternity and concord. At their\r\ninitiative, on 14 December 1994 the National Assembly\r\nadopted a law of general amnesty for those responsible for\r\nthe acts of aggression of 25 March 1993 and 5 and 6\r\nJanuary 1994.\r\nToday, peace and order have been restored, for the\r\npeople of Togo have been able to surmount their opposing\r\nviews and achieve reconciliation. They have understood that\r\ndemocratization is a long-term undertaking, one that must\r\nbe based on the historical, social and cultural realities of a\r\ncountry if it is to be effective and promote political\r\nstability, economic development and social justice.\r\nToday, the collective effort to restore our national\r\neconomy is continuing without interruption and all the\r\npeople of Togo are determined to give of their best in the\r\nrebuilding of what they hold most dear, their homeland\r\nTogo, in order to restore its reputation and ensure its\r\nactive participation in the concert of nations.\r\nGiven the still fragile nature of our economy, and in\r\norder to ensure the strengthening of democracy, political\r\nstability and social unity, Togo calls upon the\r\ninternational community to give its strong support to the\r\nefforts our Government is undertaking to achieve the\r\ncountry’s total recovery.\r\nAs I said earlier, the founding of the United Nations\r\nwas a response to the yearning of the peoples of the\r\nworld to live in peace, which is a prerequisite for\r\nprogress. Today, however, there is still a long road to\r\ntravel in the attainment of that peace, the principal goal\r\nof the United Nations, for the world is still experiencing\r\nhorrible upheavals and intolerance that daily threaten the\r\nhope of our peoples to live in a peaceful and secure\r\nworld.\r\nIndeed, uncertainty, anxiety and despair still haunt\r\nthousands of people, principally because of continuing\r\nfratricidal conflicts and poverty. Rivalry among\r\nneighbours, fanaticism and ethnic tensions continue\r\ninexorably to stoke the fires of discord and create armed\r\nconflicts, with all their accompanying horrors.\r\nIn Africa, the conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone and\r\nSomalia and the situations in Rwanda, Burundi and\r\nAngola continue to present challenges to the international\r\ncommunity and to call into question its ability effectively\r\nto ensure international peace and security.\r\nWith regard to the conflict in Liberia, which is now\r\nbeing resolved, my country welcomes the signing of a\r\nnew Agreement on 19 August 1995 in Abuja under the\r\naegis of the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), and the installation of the State Council and\r\nTransitional Government pursuant to that Agreement.\r\nTogo calls upon its brothers in Liberia to shoulder\r\ntheir responsibilities to ensure the sincere and full\r\nimplementation of that Agreement. We urge them to do\r\nall they can to guarantee the cease-fire, support the new\r\ntransition institutions and contribute in good faith to\r\ndisarmament with a view to establishing an environment\r\nfavourable to the organization of the general open\r\nelections called for in the Agreement.\r\nWhile the international community is witnessing a\r\nnascent improvement of the situation in Liberia, the war\r\nwaged in neighbouring Sierra Leone by the Revolutionary\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nUnited Front (RUF) is continuing, with all its\r\naccompanying misery.\r\nMy delegation would remind our brothers in Sierra\r\nLeone that experience continues to prove the weapons do\r\nnot provide lasting solutions to any problem, no matter\r\nwhat.\r\nTurning to Somalia, my delegation deeply regrets that\r\nno appreciable progress has been made since the last\r\nsession. Unfortunately, we are forced to state that despite\r\nthe relative calm there, Somalia has become a country\r\nwhere national reconciliation and the establishment of a\r\nGovernment based on broad consensus are still hypothetical\r\nowing to fluctuating allegiances among the clans. That\r\nsituation continues to contribute to the eruption of violence\r\nand hinders the advent of peace to that country.\r\nMy Government therefore urgently appeals once again\r\nto our brothers in Somalia to enter into a true and solid\r\nprocess of national reconciliation, the sole way to ensure\r\nviable peace and establish a Somali State that the\r\ninternational community would regard as representative.\r\nIn Rwanda, the situation following last year’s\r\nmassacres is still disturbing owing to the insecurity and\r\nintolerance that make peace and stability fragile, jeopardize\r\nthe return of refugees and threaten to embroil the entire\r\nsubregion. Given the climate there it is imperative for the\r\nRwandese Government to persevere on the courageous path\r\nof national reconciliation so that the country may regain its\r\nunity and the political stability essential to its\r\nreconstruction.\r\nThe international community must also commit itself\r\nto lending real assistance to Rwanda’s efforts to establish\r\nbetter conditions that will encourage the repatriation of\r\nrefugees to their country of origin.\r\nIn the neighbouring country of Burundi the no-war,\r\nno-peace situation is still a matter of concern to my\r\ncountry. Those involved in Burundi’s political life must\r\nrenounce all acts of violence of any kind and demonstrate\r\nwisdom and mutual acceptance in seeking solutions to the\r\nproblems facing them.\r\nIn the same spirit, my delegation urgently appeals to\r\nall the children of Burundi to adhere fully to the Agreement\r\nof Government signed on 10 September 1994 and to do\r\neverything they can to implement that Agreement in the\r\ninterests of peace and the people of Burundi. We believe\r\nthat they must also try to accept the initiatives of the\r\nCentral Conflict Prevention, Handling Management and\r\nSettlement Mechanism of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), which is attempting to organize a round-\r\ntable meeting of the parties involved in the Burundi crisis.\r\nHere too, the international community must continue\r\nto support Burundi so as to enable it to find peace as\r\nsoon as possible and to continue its development.\r\nTurning to the situation in Angola, the Togolese\r\nGovernment welcomes the resumption of the dialogue\r\nbetween President José Eduardo Dos Santos and the\r\nleader of UNITA, Mr. Jonas Savimbi. We noted with\r\ngreat satisfaction the positive evolution of the peace\r\nprocess under way as a result of the Lusaka peace\r\nagreement. We welcome the two meetings that took place\r\nthis year, and we see in them the firm resolve of our\r\nAngolan brothers to overcome their differences and set\r\nabout the irreversible creation of an atmosphere of\r\nunderstanding which alone can foster peace and national\r\nharmony.\r\nMy delegation greatly appreciates the active role that\r\nthe United Nations continues to play in the resolution of\r\nthat conflict, and we would call on the Secretary-General\r\nto speed up the deployment of the forces to be made\r\navailable to the United Nations Angola Verification\r\nMission (UNAVEM III).\r\nIn Europe, despite diplomatic efforts to find a\r\ndefinitive settlement of the conflict in the former\r\nYugoslavia, the situation there remains a source of\r\nprofound concern to all peace-loving countries.\r\nMy Government notes with regret that, in spite of\r\nmany measures taken by the United Nations, the state of\r\nwar in that part of Europe persists, continuing to claim\r\ncountless victims and give rise to flows of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons. Togo believes that the international\r\ncommunity must become more deeply involved in order\r\nto stem, if not halt, the tide of massive destruction\r\nadvancing before our eyes.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, it is time for the Serb,\r\nCroat and Bosniac leaders to give up the idea of acquiring\r\nterritory by force and to seek a definitive solution to the\r\nconflict through negotiations, with a view to ensuring an\r\nirreversible, comprehensive and just solution that would\r\nguarantee sovereignty and territorial integrity to all the\r\nStates of the former Yugoslavia within internationally\r\nrecognized borders.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nThe recent positive developments in the Middle East,\r\nmarked essentially by the adoption of a timetable for the\r\nsecond phase of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from\r\nPalestinian cities and the transfer of new powers to the\r\nPalestinian Authority, give my delegation grounds for\r\nsatisfaction. We regard these recently concluded agreements\r\nas a great achievement, a decisive step towards the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State.\r\nTogo congratulates the Israeli Government and the\r\nPalestinian Authority for the courage, commitment and\r\ninitiative they have shown in implementing the Declaration\r\nof Principles and the subsequent agreements despite the\r\nmany dangers that beset the path to peace. We urge them\r\nto continue the quest for a settlement of the question of\r\nPalestine through negotiations, the path they have chosen,\r\nsince true and lasting peace unquestionably involves\r\ndialogue.\r\nWe would appeal to the good will of the international\r\ncommunity to live up to its commitments by providing the\r\nPalestinian Authority with the necessary economic and\r\nsocial assistance for the development of Gaza and Jericho.\r\nWith regard to the Golan, my delegation would urge\r\nIsrael and Syria to demonstrate far-sightedness, good will\r\nand mutual understanding so as to arrive as quickly as\r\npossible at an agreement that could bring a just and lasting\r\npeace to the Middle East region.\r\nTurning to Asia, Togo welcomes the establishment at\r\nvarious levels of dialogue aimed at peaceful coexistence,\r\nand trusts that this political will be maintained.\r\nThese various hotbeds of tension, which jeopardize the\r\nexistence of mankind and which my delegation has just\r\nbriefly described, are a challenge to our collective\r\nconscience and, first and foremost, to the United Nations,\r\nthe only world structure that can ensure universal peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nOn the eve of the second half of its first century, it\r\nbehoves our Organization to mobilize to combat the evils\r\nafflicting the world and that make it vulnerable. That task\r\nmust be one of our highest priorities if we want to leave to\r\nfuture generations a healthy world based on respect for\r\nhuman dignity, love and justice.\r\nTo attain this prime objective, which is to prevent\r\nconflicts from erupting or from continuing indefinitely,\r\nprevention must increasingly feature in the forefront of the\r\nmeasures taken by our Organization in favour of peace, for\r\nit is always better to prevent war than to try to end it.\r\nThis justifies the great importance we attach to preventive\r\ndiplomacy.\r\nMy delegation believes that the various peace-\r\nkeeping operations being conducted in countries riven by\r\nconflict must be accompanied and supported by the\r\nparallel and systematic establishment of mechanisms for\r\na peaceful settlement. The measures provided for in\r\nChapter VI of the Charter must be increasingly employed\r\nto this end. “An Agenda for Peace” can achieve its full\r\nimport only if the United Nations, in its quest for peace,\r\nresorts to diplomatic procedures as a means of settling\r\ndisputes.\r\nThe objectives of peace and security that we seek\r\nmust necessarily also involve curbing the proliferation of\r\nweapons of all kinds.\r\nGeneral and complete disarmament is and has for\r\nmany years been one of the main objectives of the United\r\nNations, whose attainment would bring peace, stability\r\nand well-being for all. The energy with which we pursue\r\nthis goal must be maintained and, indeed, increased, if the\r\nhopes of mankind to avoid a new holocaust are to be\r\nfulfilled.\r\nTo that end, my delegation believes that we must\r\ncontinue to encourage a tangible reduction in the nuclear\r\nthreat, the elimination of special fissile materials and the\r\nconversion of nuclear installations for solely peaceful\r\npurposes.\r\nAll these overarching tasks require the unconditional\r\nsupport of all States, and particularly nuclear-weapon\r\nStates, so that we can use the resources made available\r\nthrough disarmament for development.\r\nConvinced of the need to free our continent from\r\nnuclear weapons, the African countries have concluded\r\ntheir consideration of the text of the Pelindaba treaty that\r\nwould establish Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nThis instrument, prepared pursuant to the relevant\r\nDeclaration of the Heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), will soon be\r\nsigned in Egypt. My country welcomes this development\r\nas opening the way for the denuclearization of Africa, and\r\ncontributing to the international trend towards non-\r\nproliferation. My delegation sees in the recent indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and in the negotiations now\r\nunder way in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva,\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nthe resolve of the international community to achieve\r\nnuclear non-proliferation and to eliminate other types of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nWith regard to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons in particular, Togo believes that its\r\nindefinite extension is not an end in itself. We have to do\r\neverything possible to ensure that it responds to the\r\naspirations of all the parties.\r\nIn general terms, Togo proclaims its deep commitment\r\nto the various measures advocated by the United Nations\r\nfor the control of conventional weapons at the regional and\r\nsubregional levels. We continue to support all initiatives\r\nthat can facilitate disarmament and arms limitation, for all\r\nthese measures can help to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWithin the context of the items relating to\r\ndisarmament, my delegation would recall the urgent need\r\nto strengthen the capacity of the United Nations Regional\r\nCentres for Peace and Disarmament. Designed to promote\r\npeace and disarmament in various regions, these Centres\r\nneed financing to function and to carry out their\r\nprogrammes of activities in order to attain the goals for\r\nwhich they were established.\r\nThis is particularly true of the Centre for Africa,\r\nwhich has its headquarters in my country. I would therefore\r\nappeal to the good will of all Member States to support this\r\nCentre by providing it with the help and assistance it needs\r\nto carry out its activities and to contribute to the\r\nmaintenance and strengthening of the peace and security\r\nwhich Africa so sorely needs to ensure its economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\nThe Charter which we adopted in 1945 states in its\r\nPreamble that the peoples of the United Nations are\r\ndetermined to promote social progress and better standards\r\nof life in larger freedom. Fifty years later, we must assess\r\nthe impact of action taken along the way to resolve the\r\nenormous problems of development.\r\nIt is clear that serious efforts are made every day to\r\neliminate poverty, hunger, malnutrition, disease and\r\nilliteracy. And yet, despite the considerable input of the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, we must note\r\nthat many peoples, particularly in the developing countries,\r\nstill live in a state of great deprivation and are exposed to\r\nall manner of scourges. In other words, the situation in\r\nthose countries is tragic: more than half a billion human\r\nbeings live in abject poverty; more than 180 million\r\nchildren suffer serious malnutrition; and more than 1.5\r\nbillion individuals have no access to primary health care.\r\nAll this, as can be imagined, leads to the death of almost\r\n3 million children every year.\r\nThis bitter truth is the result of the injustice and\r\ninequality that characterize international cooperation\r\nrelations. In the absence of real understanding and\r\nsolidarity on the part of Member States, the poorest\r\ncontinue to suffer and the well-off grow ever more\r\nopulent. Distortions in economic relations between North\r\nand South do not reflect the spirit of our Charter. For\r\ndecades now, the developing countries have called for the\r\nestablishment of a new, more just and equitable\r\ninternational economic order, but their concerns are not\r\ntaken duly into account.\r\nIn this regard, it would not be overstating matters\r\nto recall that the continued drop in our commodity prices;\r\nthe sharp deterioration in the terms of trade; the problems\r\nrelating to access for products from developing countries\r\nin general, and African countries in particular, to world\r\nmarkets; and the foreign debt burden are all obstacles that\r\nmust be removed if we are to accelerate and strengthen\r\nthe process of sustainable development.\r\nIt is important therefore that our partners in the\r\nindustrialized countries should try harder to understand\r\nour problems in order that they may be better able to\r\nsupport our efforts. This multifaceted support must seek\r\nto ensure remunerative prices for our commodities and the\r\nnecessary technological support for processing these\r\ncommodities so as to ensure access for our products to\r\ninternational markets. To that end, the international\r\ncommunity must provide special assistance to Africa in\r\norder to build viable, lasting and competitive industrial\r\nstructures.\r\nIn this connection, my country would invite all those\r\ninvolved in development, and particularly industrialized\r\ncountries anxious about the future of Africa, to give new\r\nimpetus to the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development, two major agencies within the United\r\nNations system established to promote industrialization\r\nand the development of trade of the developing countries\r\nas a whole and particularly in Africa.\r\nAt a time when the globalization and liberalization\r\nof the world economy are accelerating as a result of\r\nrecent agreements made at the Uruguay Round, we should\r\ncreate new opportunities for cooperation to help African\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ncountries become part of the world trading system and\r\nbenefit from the advantages it offers for growth. The basic\r\nway to do so is to help Africa, through the appropriate\r\ntransfer of technology, to progress like other regions and to\r\nrespond to new conditions governing access to markets in\r\norder to become a real actor in the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe prospects for Africa’s development are not\r\npromising because the socio-economic situation is so\r\nprecarious and efforts made to date to step up progress\r\nhave proven vain. Indeed, Africa is being crippled under\r\nthe enormous weight of its debt. In 1994, the debt burden\r\nreached $313 billion and today represents 231.3 per cent of\r\nits export earnings, or an average of 71.6 per cent of its\r\ngross domestic product. Moreover, the continuing drop in\r\nofficial development assistance to African States has put\r\nAfrica in a very critical economic situation.\r\nFar from accepting this situation as our fated lot and\r\naware that we must rely on our own efforts, this year the\r\nAfrican countries adopted, in Egypt, the Cairo Programme\r\nof Action, which aims at ensuring the immediate\r\nrelaunching of Africa’s economic and social development\r\nthrough political and economic reforms and a global and\r\ncoherent strategy. My country is ready to assume its share\r\nof the responsibility in the implementation of that\r\nProgramme.\r\nOn the crucial issue of debt, Togo would once again\r\nappeal to the international community and to the creditors\r\nin particular to consider cancelling the concessional debt\r\nrescheduled in the Paris Club. We would urge the adoption\r\nof innovative measures to reduce the multilateral debt,\r\nincluding the repurchase of that category of debt with the\r\nproceeds of the sale of part of the International Monetary\r\nFund’s gold reserves. In short, this question must be\r\naddressed on an equitable basis with a view to a lasting\r\nsolution.\r\nFurthermore, giving new impetus to development in\r\nAfrica must include the mobilization of financial resources\r\nboth through official development assistance and through\r\nprivate investment. In this regard, my delegation would\r\ninvite our partners in the developed countries to renew and\r\nstrengthen their political commitment to support the\r\nrecovery of the African economy, for economic and\r\nfinancial stability in Africa will most certainly be in the\r\ninterests of the world economy.\r\nTogo duly appreciates the efforts of the United\r\nNations and the international community over the past 50\r\nyears to promote economic and socio-cultural\r\ndevelopment. In particular, we hail the initiatives that led\r\nto the adoption of the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction for African Economic Recovery and Development\r\nand the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s, as well as the Paris Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least-Developed Countries\r\nfor the 1990s.\r\nIt is none the less regrettable that the implementation\r\nof these instruments, which were able to take into account\r\nthe concerns of Africa in various areas of development,\r\nhas yet to receive the support it deserves for the benefit\r\nof our continent and the least-developed countries in\r\nparticular. Thus the economic and social performance\r\nwhich they should have sparked has not lived up to the\r\nexpectations of the peoples of Africa.\r\nIn view of the present state of development in\r\nAfrica, the international community must make a\r\nsubstantial contribution towards attaining the objectives\r\nset forth, not only of the New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, but also of other\r\nprogrammes of action. Africa needs to be given specific\r\nattention commensurate with its problems, first among\r\nwhich is poverty. Indeed, according to data collected by\r\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the\r\nnumber of the most needy rose from 105 million in 1985\r\nto 216 million in 1990 and may reach 304 million by the\r\nyear 2000.\r\nThe collective security to which all peoples aspire\r\nalso depends on finding determined and credible solutions\r\nto the question of poverty, to which a great portion of the\r\nworld is subject. Along the same lines, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions must do more to ensure that structural\r\nadjustment programmes are politically, socially and\r\nhumanly feasible for those countries which must\r\nimplement them. My delegation concurs with the\r\nproposals for reform of the international financial and\r\nmonetary system with a view to adapting them to the\r\nneeds of our day, to make it more equitable and to allow\r\nit to respond to the true aspirations of peoples.\r\nIn its search for appropriate solutions to economical\r\nand social problems, the United Nations was prompted\r\nthis year to organize the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen. My country welcomed the\r\nholding of that Summit, the first in the annals of our\r\nOrganization to offer such a marvellous opportunity for\r\ndeep reflection at the highest level on the issues of human\r\nand social development that are of major importance for\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nmankind. My delegation welcomes the 10-point\r\ncommitments adopted at the Summit and hopes that in\r\nimplementing those commitments for the benefit of the\r\nentire world all our countries will show the fervour that led\r\nthem to prepare and participate in the Summit.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, held just a\r\nfew days ago in Beijing, is another illustration of our\r\nOrganization’s determination not to neglect any of the\r\nobjectives it has set for itself. The Togolese Government,\r\nwhich values women’s active role in the development\r\nprocess and accords them rightful pride of place in human\r\nsociety, will spare no effort to implement the\r\nrecommendations emanating from that Conference. We urge\r\nthe international community to shoulder its share of\r\nresponsibility in the implementation of those\r\nrecommendations so that women can fully play their role in\r\nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous world.\r\nWith regard to the question of the environment, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the signing in Paris, in October 1994,\r\nof the international Convention on combating drought and\r\ndesertification, and we welcome most especially the entry\r\ninto force of the Convention on Biological Diversity and\r\nthe Convention on Climate Change. However, we do not\r\nbelieve that the signing and entry into force of those\r\nConventions are an end in themselves. In the light of the\r\nuniversal concern of a few years ago over the extensive\r\ndegradation of the environment and the enthusiasm aroused\r\nby the Rio Conference, our countries must take the\r\nnecessary measures to attain the objectives set forth in\r\nthose various international legal instruments.\r\nThis coming 24 October the United Nations will be\r\ncommemorating its fiftieth anniversary. It has at times been\r\ndifficult to put into effect the purposes and principles of the\r\nSan Francisco Charter, and the results achieved have not\r\nalways lived fully up to our expectations. But with the\r\nbeginning of this new phase, one could hope that — on the\r\nbasis of lessons learned by evaluating the activities of the\r\npast half-century and on the basis of Member States’\r\ncapacity to adapt to the ever-shifting realities of the\r\ninternational context — our Organization will truly live up\r\nto its new ambitions.\r\nAs it is about to enter the second half of its first 100\r\nyears, the United Nations must preserve its universality and\r\nconsolidate its vitality, through prudent reform and\r\nappropriate strengthening of its entire system and its\r\nprincipal organs, including the Security Council, so that\r\njustice and equality may triumph.\r\nThe enormous tasks awaiting our Organization on\r\nthe eve of the third millennium require that Member\r\nStates have greater political will so that the objective of\r\nthe restructuring and democratization process now under\r\nway can be attained to the satisfaction of all, and so that\r\nMember States can participate together, on the basis of\r\nsovereign equality, in managing the affairs of the world.\r\nThe same political will is needed in order for\r\ndevelopment assistance to regain priority status, so that\r\nthe men, women and children of the countries of the\r\nSouth will enjoy the support that is essential for them to\r\nprosper.\r\nIn doing all this, an inestimable contribution will be\r\nmade to the promotion of human rights and the right to\r\ndevelopment, which is another way of averting threats to\r\ndomestic, regional and global peace and security.\r\nAs for my country, it renews its commitment to the\r\nnoble ideals of the United Nations, and, as always, it will\r\ndo its utmost to help build a world of peace and justice\r\nfor all.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation form Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brunei\r\nDarussalam, His Royal Highness Prince Mohamed\r\nBolkiah.\r\nPrince Mohamed Bolkiah (Brunei Darussalam): As\r\nwe will soon be commemorating half a century of United\r\nNations work, may I start by presenting warm fiftieth-\r\nanniversary greetings from Brunei Darussalam to all our\r\nfellow Members.\r\nAlso, before commenting on our present situation, I\r\nwould like to take this brief opportunity to thank two\r\ngroups of people who do not receive much publicity and\r\nwho I hope will not be overlooked in the general\r\ncelebration.\r\nFirst, I think it would be most appropriate at this\r\ntime to mention those who have served this Organization\r\nin the field as representatives of our various agencies or\r\nas part of our peace-keeping operations and special\r\nmissions. Their work has always been at the heart of\r\nUnited Nations efforts. It has given people throughout the\r\nworld a chance to look ahead with hope, and we wish all\r\nwho are engaged in this work much continued success.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to look outside our\r\nOrganization and thank our hosts. Here I am referring to\r\nthe people of New York and all the other cities around\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nthe world who for 50 years have accepted the demanding\r\nresponsibility of being a United Nations venue. Their\r\nsupport and good will have been crucial, and I would like\r\nto say how much we appreciate this.\r\nWith that, may I now turn to current business and\r\noffer the President my congratulations on his election. I am\r\nsure he will guide us well during what we hope will be a\r\nmost successful year.\r\nI would also like to thank the outgoing President, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his contribution to our\r\nwork over the past year and to convey my best wishes to\r\nthe Secretary-General and his staff.\r\nGiven all the recent changes which have taken place\r\nin world affairs, our fiftieth anniversary comes at a critical\r\nperiod. I would therefore like to offer a few thoughts on the\r\napproach we in Brunei Darussalam would like to see the\r\nUnited Nations taking in the future.\r\nFifty years ago, at the first session of the General\r\nAssembly, President Truman’s opening address described\r\nthe purpose of the United Nations as being\r\n“to provide the means for maintaining international\r\npeace in the future”. (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, First Session, Plenary Meetings, 34th\r\nmeeting, p. 682)\r\nThe approach the United Nations took at that time was\r\nsuccessful. It certainly stopped great Powers from making\r\nwar on each other in Europe. However, it also led to the\r\ncold war. This is now over, but it seems to have left behind\r\na situation in which there is great potential for instability in\r\nthe rest of the world.\r\nMuch of this, of course, is the result of the changes\r\nwhich have taken place in 50 years. The centres of power\r\nhave moved, and the danger spots have shifted. We all\r\ndepend on each other a lot more for peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. The changes are so profound that many of us\r\nfeel they may call for an equally profound reform of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nBrunei Darussalam is a fairly new Member, but we\r\ntend to think there is a strong case for this. We believe the\r\nUnited Nations has to adapt to change. We also hope this\r\ncan be done soon. The future could hold some very serious\r\nproblems, and they will require a United Nations which is\r\nwell prepared to handle them.\r\nThe very worrying signs of what could lie ahead are\r\nalready quite clear. There are humanitarian problems on\r\na vast scale. We face social and environmental issues\r\nwhich affect the whole world. There is instability in world\r\nfinancial affairs. Trade disputes disrupt the peaceful\r\nconduct of international commerce. There is also what we\r\nbelieve is the most serious concern of all: the\r\ndevelopment gap between the North and the South is\r\ngrowing wider and wider.\r\nThis all means that the United Nations has an\r\nextremely challenging agenda as it starts out on the next\r\n50 years of its existence. An international situation now\r\nexists in which it is essential that we recognize the stake\r\neach of us has in the welfare of all the others. We all\r\nhave to reaffirm our commitment to working very closely\r\ntogether as United Nations Members.\r\nSo perhaps the most encouraging feature of\r\ninternational affairs today is that in every part of the\r\nworld countries are trying very hard indeed to respond to\r\nthis new challenge. I also think it is fair to say that\r\nwhatever can be done by individual countries or regional\r\nassociation is being attempted.\r\nHaving said that, however, I must add that there is\r\none thing we cannot do: no country or regional group on\r\nits own can make the whole world stable and peaceful.\r\nFor this, we rely on the United Nations. It is the only\r\nmechanism which can deal with the basic causes of\r\ninstability. Therefore, I would like to suggest that this is\r\nthe most important responsibility of the United Nations\r\ntoday. If it is to carry it out successfully, however, I also\r\nsuggest that there are a number of useful lessons to be\r\nlearned from recent experiences.\r\nThe first of these arises from the crisis faced by the\r\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1991.\r\nCertainly, we are pleased to see welcome signs of hope\r\nin that country.\r\nHowever, I think it will be very difficult for most of\r\nus to forget how badly United Nations personnel have\r\nbeen treated. Nor do we wish ever again to experience the\r\nfrustration we have felt over our representatives’ inability\r\nto implement Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe Bosnian tragedy has obviously raised a great\r\nnumber of questions. But, above all, I feel, we have been\r\ntaught one extremely important thing: if the United\r\nNations is to be involved in a future situation like this, its\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nrepresentatives must be given all the resources they need,\r\nso that they can carry out their tasks effectively.\r\nA second lesson can be drawn, from the Middle East.\r\nWe are still hopeful that the peace process there will reach\r\na just and comprehensive conclusion. However, what has\r\nbeen shown in Palestine is what was also evident in\r\nCambodia: peace negotiations and even peace treaties\r\nrequire more than just formal recognition by the\r\ninternational community; practical assistance from us all is\r\nneeded if the result is to be lasting peace.\r\nThe third recent lesson I see for us lies in recognizing\r\nto the full that the end of the cold war has made us aware\r\nof many other aspects of security which lie deeper than just\r\nmilitary defence.\r\nNext year, we hope that a comprehensive test ban\r\ntreaty will be in effect. Among other things, it would be a\r\nmost appropriate way to acknowledge the reminders we\r\nhave had this year of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But it\r\nshould also mean that everyone accepts that it is\r\nunthinkable for nuclear weapons ever to be used again. The\r\nultimate aim now is the abolition of all such weapons. If\r\nthis is indeed accepted, then the idea of nuclear weapons as\r\na deterrent cannot be logically sustained; nor can the need\r\nto continue testing such weapons.\r\nInstead, the logic of the post cold war period applies\r\nand leads us to the more modern concept of security. In\r\nother words, we should be doing everything we can to take\r\nadvantage of the peace dividend and work together to solve\r\nthe great environmental, social and economic challenges we\r\nall face.\r\nThere is one more lesson I believe this early post cold\r\nwar period has taught us. It is perhaps the most urgent of\r\nall. This is that the increasing gap between the North and\r\nthe South in terms of development and the possibility of\r\nmaking progress must be closed.\r\nThe Secretary-General has suggested an important\r\nshift in emphasis for the United Nations — from politics to\r\nglobal economic development. I think the Secretary-General\r\nis quite right. It is essential that the United Nations move\r\nin this direction. Peace-keeping, though much valued, is a\r\ncostly, short-term response to global peace. The longer-term\r\nsolution is widespread economic development. What we do\r\nask, however, is that this be done urgently as time is not on\r\nthe side of developing nations.\r\nWe naturally cannot predict what form the United\r\nNations will take in the next half century of its existence.\r\nOne thing, however, is beyond question, I feel: the world\r\nis even more than ever in need of the moral force of\r\nUnited Nations principles to guide it.\r\nMay I assure you, Mr. President, that in its efforts to\r\nremain strong and effective and credible, the United\r\nNations has the lasting support and commitment of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Secretary\r\nof State for Foreign and Political Affairs of the Republic\r\nof San Marino, His Excellency Mr. Gabriele Gatti.\r\nMr. Gatti (Republic of San Marino) (spoke in\r\nItalian; English text furnished by the delegation): Allow\r\nme to begin my address with a personal consideration.\r\nBefore arriving in New York to participate in this fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, I thought over and over\r\nabout the possible tangible outcome of this debate. In\r\nparticular, I tried to determine the present power and\r\nstrength of Member States — and especially of the small\r\nones like my own — in terms of taking decisive actions\r\naimed at preventing, monitoring and managing critical and\r\nconflict situations, and, in general, all those circumstances\r\nwhich run counter to the requirements and objectives of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThere is no need for too many words to describe all\r\nthe evils besetting our international community and\r\nreflecting the disturbing and serious changes in its\r\nattitudes, and, above all, in its mentality. I believe, in fact,\r\nthat the present situation in the former Yugoslavia alone\r\nsummarizes and reflects in detail all of these factors.\r\nFirst of all, there is the war, which, because of its\r\nlong duration, seems to have been generally accepted as\r\nan inevitable condition — a war that is still going on\r\ndespite all the efforts to find a peaceful, negotiated and\r\npolitical solution; a war that has seen few truces — and\r\nthose that have existed have not been respected; a war\r\ninvolving many sophisticated weapons, in spite of all\r\nsolemn bans on them; and a war that is the consequence\r\nof speculation and the result of the search for profit at all\r\ncosts.\r\nThe United Nations must have the strength to take\r\na stand against war. It is also evident that resolutions,\r\ncondemnations, embargoes and the dispatching of peace-\r\nkeeping forces — which sometimes prove useless,\r\nbecoming innocent victims — are no longer sufficient.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nWhy should we not admit, then, that the United Nations,\r\nespecially in the former Yugoslavia, has revealed its\r\nweakness and its inability to stop a massacre?\r\nThere must be another solution. Let us reflect on more\r\neffective approaches and adapt the tools at our disposal to\r\na world that seems to be increasingly pervaded by\r\narrogance, presumption and evil.\r\nAlthough the United Nations has to its credit important\r\nachievements and positive results that deserve general\r\nacknowledgment and appreciation, the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof its foundation is not merely a commemorative event and\r\ncannot be regarded as such. This anniversary must also\r\nprovide an opportunity to assess, review and, where\r\nnecessary, make adjustments.\r\nSome structural changes in important United Nations\r\nbodies have been discussed for a number of years. A debate\r\nis under way on the reform of the Security Council, as is\r\nanother — with less interest and vitality — on the\r\npossibilities for the smallest States fully to enjoy, without\r\nlimitations, the rights and opportunities granted to them by\r\nthe Charter.\r\nThese are all important issues in which my country is\r\ndeeply interested. Yet should we not give conflict\r\nmanagement and resolution the highest priority? I am\r\nreferring not only to international conflicts, but also to\r\ncertain domestic situations, because of the serious violations\r\nand the unanimously condemned tragic consequences they\r\nentail. They should be considered matters of global\r\nconcern.\r\nIn this context, I must mention one of the most serious\r\naspects of the present situation in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nnamely human-rights violations. Those rights, enshrined in\r\nthe documents of the United Nations, of the Council of\r\nEurope, of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe and in other declarations, are all manifestly being\r\ninfringed. Offences against human dignity are by far the\r\ngravest of all violations. They are based on a non-\r\nrecognition of the human individual and of the freedom to\r\npractise a religion, to belong to a minority, to be different\r\nfrom the majority or even from the minority.\r\nI believe that the greatest challenge confronting\r\nhumankind, as we approach the year 2000, is the practice\r\nof tolerance. War, hunger, the need to find gainful\r\nemployment, the natural aspiration of individuals to\r\nimprove their living standards, and class conflicts remain.\r\nThe quest for supremacy by ethnic groups and minorities,\r\nwhich often results in practices of mass destruction, is no\r\ndifferent from the old, repudiated theory of racial\r\nsuperiority, so painfully experienced by Europe during the\r\nlast world war. We must remember also the total absence\r\nof protection for children and the lack of respect for\r\nwomen and their bodies, victims as they are of violence\r\nperpetrated on unbelievable racial grounds. These factors\r\nhave made migrations an almost natural component of our\r\ninternational society.\r\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees has warned us of the onset of a new and\r\nwidespread phenomenon — already seen in some African\r\ncountries — which will be the logical consequence of the\r\nwar in the former Yugoslavia. In its appeal, the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR) refers to the new category of internally\r\ndisplaced persons, who have been forced to leave their\r\nhouses, deprived of the little property they had and of\r\nemployment opportunities. At the same time, estimates\r\nshow a constantly increasing flow of refugees, who have\r\nleft their countries of origin in search of a place to live\r\nand of opportunities, however modest, that would enable\r\nthem to start a new life.\r\nThus, future generations will inevitably live in a\r\ndifferent society from our own. Their neighbours or\r\ncolleagues might be of a different colour or race, practise\r\na different religion, perform traditional rites unknown to\r\nus, have different habits and approach problems, and life\r\nin general, in a completely different way. To ensure a just\r\nand peaceful coexistence, future generations will have to\r\nlearn how to adapt to this new reality, to understand and\r\naccept the principle that people are all equal and free to\r\nbe different.\r\nSolidarity must stem from this conviction and be\r\ntranslated into consistent behaviour. Solidarity should not\r\nbe expressed merely through acts of charity or donations\r\nof superfluous things, with care taken not to lose one’s\r\nprivileged economic position. There must be a\r\ncommitment on the part of all States to make solidarity\r\namong them a way of life. Hunger, natural disasters and\r\nman-made environmental destruction, wars, famines, the\r\nendemic poverty of some regions and peoples — which\r\nis caused, or aggravated, by bad management on the part\r\nof those governing them — are no longer occasional\r\nevents requiring an outburst of generosity. Today, these\r\nfactors have become ever-present in the world and call for\r\na concerted and lasting commitment.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nRich countries should make the necessary\r\ncontributions to helping poor countries eradicate deeply\r\nrooted causes of distress by formulating a common, global,\r\nresponsible and transparent policy. Due precaution must be\r\ntaken not to overburden programmes agreed upon with\r\nadministrative infrastructures which could be detrimental to\r\nfinancial resources and delay prompt intervention because\r\nof bureaucratic hurdles.\r\nSan Marino believes that many other issues deserve\r\nattentive consideration and utmost priority.\r\nSan Marino believes that it is high time to rethink the\r\ntool of the embargo, its effectiveness and, above all, its\r\nconsequences. In the absence of armed conflicts, the\r\ninternational isolation of a State represents a valid political\r\nand moral instrument with which to exert pressure on that\r\nState as well as a strong incentive for it to change,\r\nespecially if it has an anti-democratic regime and does not\r\nrecognize or respect the rights of its citizens or the rights\r\nset forth by international law in its conduct towards other\r\nnations.\r\nHowever, when an embargo is imposed on a country\r\nfor long periods, it also affects its social and commercial\r\nsectors. In this case, the main victim is not the regime but\r\nthe population, which is already suffering from that system\r\nand probably has neither the strength nor the means to\r\nchange or overthrow it. This is unacceptable.\r\nWhen the imposition of an embargo results in the\r\nmisery of a population and in the deterioration of a\r\ncountry’s basic structures, including its health-care system,\r\nthen that embargo must be reconsidered and adjusted to\r\nmeet human-rights requirements.\r\nCapital punishment is another issue that is extremely\r\nimportant to my country and that has been repeatedly\r\ndebated in the General Assembly. It is not difficult to\r\nunderstand that certain countries — principally those with\r\na large territory and population — require strong deterrents\r\nin order to maintain order and protect their citizens’ lives,\r\nproperty and tranquillity. It is also generally recognized that\r\nsome crimes, atrocities and grave offences need to be\r\nseverely punished. Nevertheless, the death penalty is too\r\ngrave a reaction and too great an offence to be accepted by\r\nthose countries that believe in the right to life, in the\r\npossibility of true repentance and, above all, in the\r\npossibility of an error on the part of the individual\r\npronouncing the verdict.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino cannot disguise its deep\r\nanxiety with regard to the problem of armaments and\r\ntheir increase and, in particular, nuclear weapons. We\r\nhope for global, controlled and irreversible disarmament.\r\nRecourse to the rule of law, to the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, to mediation and to international forums is the\r\nindispensable foundation of a really advanced and\r\ncivilized society. Unfortunately, the threat and use of\r\nforce are still considered by many as the only instruments\r\nto be used in the survival of a State.\r\nFurthermore, the production and stockpiling of\r\nnuclear weapons, as well as nuclear tests, have become a\r\npervasive feature of the contemporary world, posing a\r\nserious threat to the security of States, to the safeguarding\r\nof the environment and to the existence of many\r\nindividuals. The concept of nuclear power as a deterrent\r\nis an elegant expression concealing its real danger. It is a\r\nshield dissimulating the desire for supremacy on the part\r\nof some States. In short, this is one of the old theories on\r\nwhich anti-democratic and anti-liberal regimes are based.\r\nIt is our duty to save future generations from the threat of\r\nnuclear weapons. San Marino hopes that the opinion of\r\nthe International Court of Justice requested by the General\r\nAssembly may promote the attainment of that objective.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the last speaker on my list, His Excellency\r\nMr. Roberto Robaina González, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Cuba.\r\nMr. Robaina González (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): There is nothing new in the newspapers these\r\ndays: “Ethnic tensions growing in various parts of the\r\nworld”; “Violence claims a three-year-old victim”;\r\n“Concerns increase over new outbreaks of dengue fever”;\r\n“Fighting continues in the Baltic”; “Young man commits\r\nsuicide after killing his parents, his brother and eight\r\nother people”; and “Children of the third world run the\r\nrisk of contracting the diseases of the Western world”. Is\r\nthis peace? Is this the new world? Is this the new order\r\nto which we committed ourselves 50 years ago? Half a\r\ncentury after the end of that devastating world war are\r\nnations really united?\r\nUntil a short while ago many of us believed that we\r\nhad finally distanced ourselves from the danger of world\r\nwar and that some long-standing confrontations were\r\nbeginning to be resolved through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation. However, the threats of a world cataclysm\r\nhave grown over decades of regional and local conflicts,\r\nstirred up by a wide range of motives involving\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ngeopolitical, economic and trading disputes as well as\r\nethnic and religious conflicts.\r\nEurope, the veteran of two world wars, which thought\r\nit was protected by a number of post-war agreements, is\r\nnow the arena for a number of confrontations in all corners\r\nof that continent. In the Balkans, concentration camps,\r\nwhich we believed had died with Hitler, have once again\r\nmade an appearance.\r\nTerrorism, originally fomented by certain powerful\r\ndeveloped countries, has now turned against those very\r\ncountries with a lash like the tail of the serpent and now, in\r\norder to combat that scourge, they are spending the same\r\nmillions they had invested earlier in perpetrating it.\r\nDrug trafficking is also terrorizing the major cities, but\r\nwhat promotes that scourge is not the cultivation of certain\r\ntypes of vegetation in the underdeveloped world, but\r\ntolerance of drug consumption and covert protection for its\r\nproduction and trade in order to make a profit in those very\r\ncities.\r\nExtremism, xenophobia, racism and discrimination on\r\nthe basis of national origin, creed or gender are\r\nproliferating once again, together with the spectre of\r\nfascism, which seems to have arisen from the tomb.\r\nGlobalization, an all-inclusive term conceived in the\r\ninterests of the major transnational corporations, is now\r\ndevouring national entities, sovereignty and independence\r\nbeyond any limit or reason, bringing in its wake a global\r\ninvasion of destitution, population growth, mass migration\r\nand environmental degradation, which cannot be avoided by\r\neven the most powerful of this world.\r\nAt the same time, ideological differences, the\r\nimposition of measures, isolation and selfish actions of all\r\nkinds continue to torpedo our new efforts to integrate into\r\nassociations, such as the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) and the recently established Association\r\nof Caribbean States (ACS).\r\nAn exclusive kind of panamericanism in this\r\nhemisphere is sabotaging the aspirations of the community\r\nof Ibero-American and Caribbean nations to strengthen their\r\nforums of regional concerted actions and to seek consensus\r\nto meet their common needs. The country that has arrogated\r\nto itself supreme leadership in this area as a manifest\r\ndestiny has, as it did two centuries ago, been conspiring to\r\nabort any regional or international association of peoples\r\nthat does not fit in with its narrow national interests.\r\nAsia and Africa, which achieved decolonization, are\r\nnow laboratories in which societies with age-old cultures\r\nand a strong tribal heritage are being afflicted with new\r\nliberal and Western models that are totally alien to their\r\nnational characteristics.\r\nFifty years on, despite all its efforts, the United\r\nNations has not been able to eliminate hunger, poverty,\r\nthe millions of children dying of diseases that are curable\r\nand entire peoples who are longing for a simple glass of\r\ndrinking water.\r\nThe virtual reality in which we are told we live\r\ntoday cannot conceal the nuclear weapons which, as has\r\nbeen asserted, may destroy the planet three times over, as\r\nif once were not enough. Nor will the illusion of the\r\nfuture created in the opulent cities so rich in show-\r\nwindows and neon lights save the world from the waste\r\nthat is being emptied into the oceans, the contamination\r\nof the atmosphere, and the destruction of ecosystems and\r\nspecies, including the human race.\r\nSuch news is rarely seen on television in the\r\ncivilized countries where we are constantly told about\r\nmarvellous detergents; but how can one cleanse the world\r\nof the horrors of war and destitution with such\r\ndetergents?\r\nLight and shadow, but above all more shadow than\r\nlight, seems to be the mood of this General Assembly on\r\nthe eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nIn preparing itself, Cuba has noted with concern the often\r\ngraceless and vulgar way in which highly developed\r\ncountries are trying to take advantage of this opportunity\r\nto define new economic, legal and political bases for the\r\nworld. These bases run counter to the true objectives of\r\npeace, development, equality and justice, as well as of the\r\npreservation and needed restoration of the cardinal\r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nIn the complex debates of the last few months many\r\ntributes have been paid to the argument of limited\r\nsovereignty, humanitarian intervention and preventive\r\ndiplomacy, all set forth in “An Agenda for Peace” in the\r\nimplementation of which the United Nations is wasting\r\ntwo thirds of its budget.\r\nThose discussions have not been free from brushes\r\nwith fashionable neo-liberal ideas that equate development\r\nwith assistance and set up chains of conditionalities\r\ndisguised as the same good intentions with which the road\r\nto hell is paved.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nFrom the bipolar world of the East-West conflict we\r\nhave moved to the unipolarism of the most powerful, and\r\nonly the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the\r\nGroup of 77 have managed to survive, although some have\r\ntried to do away with them, silence them or reeducate them,\r\nas if the problems of the third world were dependent solely\r\non disputes between the great Powers and their post-war\r\nallies.\r\nTo the calls by the vast majority of the world for the\r\npreservation of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States, which are\r\nthe bases of international law, we have been given answers\r\nthat seek to destroy those principles for the benefit of a\r\nfew. Whenever reason raises its head, an attempt is made\r\nto trample on the third world’s right to development by\r\nimposing mechanisms in which the factor of domination is\r\ninherent, something this Organization was established\r\nprecisely to combat.\r\nAll the efforts and time we have spent here to\r\nestablish a new, more just and more equitable economic\r\norder have been doomed to failure by the intransigence of\r\nthe rich, which has made the gap between rich and poor a\r\ngulf that is ever-more unspannable.\r\nA great wave of privatization has done away with\r\nnational structures and is jeopardizing the important but\r\nfragile social achievements of mankind in its development.\r\nStreets, parks, cities and even prisons are being\r\nprivatized, and under this influence it would appear that we\r\nare now approaching the privatization of law and of world\r\npower, and the United Nations itself is unable to escape\r\nfrom this, for some believe that the bulk of Member States\r\nhave little or nothing to say in deciding their own destinies.\r\nLet us agree on this: the world has changed. We can\r\nrepeat it. It is true. But how has it changed?\r\nNotwithstanding the impressive achievements of the\r\nhuman race we are forced to live at the same time with\r\nunspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual\r\nprogress in which we might feel some pride as we approach\r\nthe new century.\r\nThe “civilizatory” crisis began in the richest and most\r\npowerful part of the planet and is now spreading to\r\ninternational agencies and into this lofty arena.\r\nThe countries of the South cannot desire or continue\r\nto support the notion that the North should constantly\r\nimpose conditions upon it. The countries of the North\r\nmust listen to our views as well as alter their own\r\npatterns of development.\r\nAlthough it is fashionable to include the issue of\r\nhuman development in the agendas of international\r\ndiscussions, it has been relegated to second place by post-\r\nmodern technocracies. There are those who celebrate the\r\nfall of the Berlin Wall and the breakdown of the\r\nEuropean socialist world without realizing that no new\r\nworld has yet been constructed to replace them and that,\r\non the contrary, many other new walls are growing up\r\naround us.\r\nFrom the centres of world power refined and subtle\r\nforms of a new colonization are being imposed as part of\r\nnational policies and national-security strategies — in\r\nother words, of extraterritorial domination.\r\nCuba knows this by heart. The ridiculous charitable\r\ngestures, the crumbs fallen from the table, the alms, all go\r\nhand in hand with the cultural and ideological invasion\r\nthat corrodes peoples from within and neutralizes them as\r\nactors on history’s stage.\r\nThe new ark of the post-modern saviours is\r\npredestined to divide humanity into the auto-elect and the\r\nexcluded. Solidarity, the symbol of love among human\r\nbeings and the essential attribute of mankind’s salvation\r\nin every age, is now an endangered species.\r\nLike the model the leadership is seeking to erect on\r\nthe basis of brutal selfishness, the third world seems\r\ncondemned to become bogged down in debates on\r\nconfrontation and cooperation and to abandon the best of\r\nthe human spirit, which is precisely this solidarity.\r\nAnd this very Organization which combated\r\ncolonialism and apartheid with such solidarity has also\r\nbeen changed into a kind of supranational mechanism far\r\nremoved from its intergovernmental design.\r\nIs there solidarity in the secret contacts and covert\r\nunderstandings that precede the decisions taken by the\r\nOrganization, which is manipulated in the interests of\r\ncertain Powers?\r\nCan we regard as solidarity the further invasions to\r\neradicate famine, safeguard peace, restore democracy and\r\nsupport so-called good governments?\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nCan there be solidarity in a Security Council without\r\ntransparency and anti-democratic in its workings, which no\r\nlonger fulfils the principles of the Charter or exceeds them\r\nand refuses to abolish the veto power and renounce\r\npermanent membership?\r\nWhat kind of solidarity do we mean when that body,\r\nthe Security Council, resists even the alternative of sharing\r\nits obsolete power fairly with other nations that better\r\nrepresent this world?\r\nIn international law we must in no way accept as valid\r\nthe life-style of those who proclaim as a national\r\nphilosophy that they have no friends or interests — unless\r\nwe wish to bring on mass suicide for the planet.\r\nAnd if we are to avoid suicide, we must definitively\r\nsupport the conclusion of treaties that will completely ban\r\natomic weapons, their technological monopoly and peaceful\r\nand simulated explosions and declare a total moratorium on\r\ntesting until the practice is completely banned. Such treaties\r\nmust be acceded to by all nuclear Powers without any\r\nexception.\r\nFor the third consecutive year I have come here\r\nmandated by Cuba to address this Assembly and to\r\ndenounce what has already been denounced, to condemn\r\nwhat has already been condemned, and to reiterate the call\r\nof the overwhelming majority of the community of nations.\r\nOn the very threshold of the twenty-first century the\r\ncriminal economic, trade and financial blockade which the\r\nUnited States has imposed against my country for 36 years\r\ncontinues. We have survived the attempt to eliminate us,\r\nwhich has been mocked by the tenacious resistance of my\r\npeople.\r\nAfter years of crisis, the Cuban economy experienced\r\na 7 per cent growth in the past year while the budget deficit\r\nwas reduced by almost half. Inflation, measured by the\r\ninformal exchange market, was reduced by more than 80\r\nper cent, and at the end of the first half of 1995 the\r\neconomy had grown by 2 per cent.\r\nSignificant economic measures made those results\r\npossible, and yet the traditional attention our Government\r\ngives to education, health, employment and social security\r\nhas never diminished.\r\nAll this has been possible because since 1959 we have\r\nzealously and resolutely defended the commitment made to\r\nthe fathers of our nation to keep it free and sovereign, 90\r\nmiles distant from that great Power that has always\r\nregarded us as part of its backyard, as some sort of annex\r\nto its own territory.\r\nIt has been possible because in this world obsessed\r\nto its very soul with buying and selling — while of\r\ncourse deriving profit from the process — we have\r\nmaintained and demonstrated that one can live with an\r\nethics based on principles, on national unity, on justice,\r\non respect for human dignity, equity, morality and loyalty,\r\nand no one — absolutely no one — has the right to\r\nquestion this.\r\nIt has also been possible because we have kept faith\r\nwith the Charter that we signed 50 years ago, with its\r\ncommitment to respect and require respect for our\r\nsovereignty, our national independence and our self-\r\ndetermination, while not allowing interference of any kind\r\nin our internal affairs.\r\nThere is more. These results have been possible\r\nbecause, free from the commitments of the past, and with\r\nthe experience of having depended economically on other\r\ncountries, we have with great sacrifice undertaken the\r\ntask of building our economic independence.\r\nIt would be ungrateful of me if, in speaking of the\r\nincredible achievements of the Cuban people, I made no\r\nreference to the millions who have stood by us during\r\nthese difficult years: the dozens of countries and\r\nGovernments that did not break off relations with Cuba,\r\nthose that strengthened their relations and those that found\r\nthe courage to enter into such relations for the first time\r\nin the face of unspeakable pressure and threats.\r\nIt is precisely now, when trade and foreign\r\ninvestment are beginning to energize the Cuban economy,\r\nthat a campaign has been launched in the United States\r\nCongress to approve a bill that would mock and run\r\ncounter to the wishes of the majority of nations and harm\r\nfree trade and all civilized forms of relations between\r\npeoples and Governments.\r\nCertain extremist sectors in this country are trying to\r\ndelay a lasting solution to the conflict between these two\r\ncountries for many years and to abort the migration\r\nagreements signed by both Governments last year.\r\nOnly two days ago the House of Representatives\r\ntook the first step towards this crime in approving that\r\nbill which, among other absurdities, proposes an\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ninternational blockade against Cuba, which is really directed\r\nagainst the whole of humanity.\r\nThis is no surprise to us because, apart from gestures\r\nfrom the many friends that we have in this great nation,\r\nthose who have directed its destiny over the last 36 years\r\nhave brought us nothing good. However, we trust that there\r\nare still honest people who, even without being friends of\r\nthe Cuban Government, may have the basic common sense\r\nto know which side is in the right.\r\nThere is also time to stay the hands of those in the\r\nSenate and the Executive Branch who wish to stab in the\r\nback the future of any attempt at a rapprochement between\r\nCuba and the United States and add new tensions to\r\ninternational relations that are already difficult.\r\nFaced with a world that accepts diversity and\r\ndifferences, that does not turn to us with aggression or\r\nisolate or discriminate against us, this North American\r\nposition is automatically blocked in time and in existence,\r\nand is isolated in its attitude towards Cuba in this\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy country does not question anybody’s right to the\r\ntype of government they desire. We urge no one to imitate\r\nour model. But neither can we accept that anyone should\r\nimpose a different one on us. We affirm this in the strong\r\nbelief that the democratic, economic and social justice\r\nprocess initiated in Cuba in 1959 has followed an honest\r\npath; it has demonstrated its viability, its strength and its\r\ncapacity to face the challenges of these times and respond\r\nto them.\r\nWe firmly believe in the authenticity and the popular\r\nsupport underpinning our revolution and our socialism —\r\na socialism as Cuban as our palm trees. We defend our\r\nright to life and to our own voice, because in the world of\r\npluralism that we aspire to, plurality and diversity among\r\nnations must be respected.\r\nIn this Assembly there are documents circulating that\r\nprove what I say, as well as vulgar threats and attempts at\r\nblackmail against those who are exercising such freedoms,\r\nnot only because they are ethical in taking the right side in\r\na matter of international interest, but because they have\r\nlinks with Havana.\r\nDiplomacy and politics these days cannot be practised\r\nby threatening families that wish to be reunited, or\r\nbusinessmen, members of Congress or politicians who have\r\nto resort to bodyguards for their own protection.\r\nWhat can we expect the next century to offer us if\r\nthis trial imposed on Cuba by a world Power succeeds?\r\nWe need something more than the reiteration of the\r\ncondemnation of the blockade in this Assembly. Cuba is\r\nfully entitled to call for action that would put an end to\r\nthis madness, because any Member State may be the next\r\nvictim in the future.\r\nIt is high time now to put an end to a conflict which\r\nhad its origins more than two centuries ago — before\r\nsocialism emerged, and long before the East-West conflict\r\nand the triumph of the Cuban revolution.\r\nCuba has managed to succeed thanks to solidarity.\r\nIn its name, we hope that the issue of human rights may\r\ncease to be used as political manoeuvring in a way that\r\nstains the honour of many decent countries. Alongside the\r\nlying and pathetic chronicles of human rights violations\r\nin Cuba, the world must recognize that there has been no\r\nlack of love, no lack of sacrifice in the salvation of\r\nmillions of women and children who, because our trade\r\nwas blockaded, did not have enough food to eat.\r\nThe often heroic and painful efforts to secure\r\nmedicine for the sick, insulin for diabetics, aminofilin for\r\nasthmatics and pacemakers for those with heart conditions\r\nmust be recognized and acknowledged, because the\r\nproviders of those medicines and the experts concerned\r\nwere warned off, boycotted or proscribed by the Treasury\r\nDepartment of the United States.\r\nThe world must know that the right to life is deeply\r\njeopardized in Cuba, and that my country is living,\r\nworking, loving and every day renewing its hopes of a\r\nbetter world in spite of that.\r\nIf truth were better valued on the market, the world\r\nwould correctly identify the most striking victims of the\r\nhuman rights violations in Cuba: the vulgar servants of a\r\nforeign Power from which they receive encouragement\r\nand resources to conspire against the very land in which\r\nthey were born to promote the annexationist aspirations of\r\nour powerful neighbour.\r\nMoreover, honest people throughout the world can\r\ndiscern among the members of the Cuban community in\r\nthis country a growing majority who have begun to\r\ndefend the sovereignty of Cuba, to claim the rights that\r\nhave also been denied them and works with all our\r\nsupport and all our respect to normalize relations with\r\ntheir homeland.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nThe world cannot be deceived all the time, least of all\r\nthe noble and hard-working people of the United States,\r\nwho daily call out for solidarity with Cuba. Without the\r\nblockade, Cuba would more clearly demonstrate its\r\nunsuspected reserves of talent and energy and the material\r\nand spiritual quality of our lives would be improved. That\r\nwould enable us to give our modest support much more\r\nfreely to the cultural and scientific advancement of all\r\nmankind and of the United States as well.\r\nIt is incredible that in the so-called land of the free,\r\ntourists and businessmen are able to travel and invest freely\r\nall around the world except to one destination and in one\r\nmarket, which is increasingly attractive and is located only\r\n90 miles from its own shores.\r\nThe people of the United States, whose economy,\r\npolitics, dignity, laws and human rights have also been\r\nprofoundly damaged, must prevent this seed sown for more\r\nthan 30 years from becoming a genuine source of national\r\nshame, as was its war against Viet Nam.\r\nLet it be clearly understood: Cuba desires normal\r\nrelations with the United States, provided that a natural\r\nfeeling of good-neighbourliness, respect and equality\r\nprevails between the two countries. But Cuba will never\r\ngive way to threats and will survive at all costs whatever\r\nhappens, because it is capable of escaping from crises, but\r\ncannot shake off the dishonour of living on its knees. It\r\nwill not do that. Cuba will continue with its forward\r\nmovement to change and develop. Our economy, although\r\nsubject to the blockade, will grow and will provide for\r\nand meet the most pressing needs of our people. The\r\npowerful infrastructure that we have built up over three\r\ndecades with what some have called the subsidy that\r\nCuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level of\r\neducation and culture and a stable land of peace and\r\norder. All of this is sustained by the broadest popular\r\nconsultation and consent and a democratic consensus\r\nenjoyed by few Governments.\r\nThe changes which Cuba has made and will continue\r\nto make in its own way apply not only to our economy,\r\nbut to our political system, civil society and institutions,\r\nin order to make our democracy increasingly genuine and\r\nparticipative. These changes fall squarely within our\r\nsovereign prerogative. They have not been made to please\r\nanyone outside, especially those who have so altered\r\nthemselves as to be unrecognizable.\r\nDay by day, minute by minute, Cuba is striving to\r\nimprove itself, to adapt and survive in this global jungle,\r\nwhere more than ever before survival of the fittest is the\r\nrule. The lion may be able to devour the deer, but he has\r\na hard time swallowing the hedgehog.\r\nFor this reason, the United Nations must also change\r\nand become more democratic, to become the genuine\r\nvehicle for development and peace which humanity needs\r\nif it is to survive. It must become a forum for dialogue\r\nand concord where the principle of the sovereign equality\r\nof States is the keystone and foundation.\r\nMany have spoken, and will continue to speak this\r\nyear, of celebrating the merits and work of the United\r\nNations, which no one can deny. On behalf of my\r\ncountry, I prefer today to commemorate rather than\r\ncelebrate and to call on this Assembly, 50 years after its\r\nfounding, to veto irrationality and vote unanimously for\r\nthe future of mankind.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
