Portugal\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Camacho Omiste\r\n(Bolivia), Vice President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nTyphoon in the Philippines\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMay I, on behalf of all of the members of the Assembly,\r\nextend our deepest sympathy to the Government and the\r\npeople of the Philippines on the tragic loss of life and\r\nextensive material damage which have resulted from the\r\nrecent typhoon. May I also express the hope that the\r\ninternational community will show its solidarity and\r\nrespond promptly and generously to any requests for help.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Allarey (Philippines): In the name of the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of the Philippines,\r\nI would like to acknowledge with a profound sense of\r\nappreciation and thanks, Sir, your expression of\r\ncommiseration and sympathy for the unfortunate victims of\r\nthe super typhoon “Angela” which struck my country last\r\nweek.\r\nThe death-and-missing toll now stands at over 600,\r\nand damages to infrastructure, crops and property have been\r\nextensive. President Fidel V. Ramos has declared a state of\r\ndisaster in the islands of Luzon and the Visayas and has\r\ntaken personal charge of relief and rehabilitation efforts in\r\nthe affected areas.\r\nAs we pick up the pieces and start rebuilding our\r\nlives, we take comfort in the knowledge that our friends\r\nand neighbours, the members of the international\r\ncommunity, are with us during this time of adversity.\r\nI shall certainly convey the sentiments that have\r\nbeen so kindly expressed in this Assembly on behalf of\r\nthe Members of the United Nations to my Government\r\nand to my countrymen.\r\nAgenda item 40 (continued)\r\nBuilding a peaceful and better world through sport\r\nand the Olympic Ideal\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.15)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nBefore calling on the first speaker, I should like to inform\r\nthe Assembly that the representative of Nigeria has\r\nrequested to participate in the debate on this item.\r\nInasmuch as the list of speakers was closed this\r\nmorning, may I ask the Assembly whether there is any\r\nobjection to the inclusion of this delegation in the list of\r\nspeakers?\r\nSince there appears to be no objection, Nigeria is\r\nincluded in the list of speakers.\r\nI now call on the representative of Romania, Mrs.\r\nLia Manoliu, President of the Romanian Olympic\r\nCommittee.\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nMrs. Manoliu (Romania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It might be presumptuous to imagine that we who\r\nbelong to the world of sport have the power to silence the\r\nguns. War has often demonstrated that it is stronger; hence\r\nthe Olympic hiatus between the years 1936 and 1948,\r\nwhich resulted from the Second World War.\r\nBut the recognition of a relative weakness in the face\r\nof the forces of evil does not necessarily mean the\r\nrecognition of impotence. I personally have had the\r\nprivilege of participating as an athlete in 6 Olympic Games,\r\nand as a member of the Romanian Olympic Committee, in\r\n7 others: 13 Games that did not all take place in optimal\r\ninternal and international political conditions. Nevertheless,\r\nI am gratified to note that my country has respected the\r\ngenuine Olympic spirit throughout these Games and\r\nthroughout this half century. Romania has never boycotted\r\nan Olympiad. There has never been a Romanian athlete\r\nwho refused to take on an opponent for political,\r\nideological, religious or racial reasons. The Romanian\r\npublic, in turn, has avidly followed the conduct of the\r\nOlympic Games, and the very natural desire to see the\r\nrepresentatives of its country achieve victory has never\r\nprevented this wonderful public from unreservedly admiring\r\nthe performance of other competitors.\r\nIt was a real process of education in the pure Olympic\r\nspirit of peace, with mutual understanding and awareness\r\nbetween peoples — a process which involved not only\r\nseveral hundred athletes, but also millions and millions of\r\nRomanians. Guided by this spirit of total dedication to\r\nOlympic values, Romania is among the traditional sponsors\r\nof the draft resolution on the Olympic Ideal, whose most\r\neloquent expression — the Olympic Games — constitutes\r\none of the most important social and cultural phenomena of\r\nour modern era, within which a collective heart beats: the\r\nheartbeat of the Olympic athletes.\r\nWhat other idea could be equally shared by the highly\r\ndeveloped and the developing States? What other institution\r\nwould be able to bring together young people from all over\r\nthe world — young people who have reached the classic\r\nage at which they become cannon fodders — despite the\r\ncurrent tensions, the hostilities and the upheavals? What\r\nother movement would be able to bring together young\r\npeople who come from countries which have been\r\nadversaries for centuries or for decades, or even from\r\ncountries openly at war at a given time in history?\r\nRegarding the organization and the direction of the\r\nOlympic Movement, a pivotal role is being played by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch, who, through his\r\npolicy of engaging in personal contacts and through the\r\nprestige which he enjoys throughout the world, within the\r\nmost varied of political and diplomatic circles, has\r\nsucceeded in making the Olympic Movement an\r\ninterlocutor of the most representative and the largest\r\nworld forum, the United Nations. The result has been first\r\nand foremost the proclamation by the United Nations of\r\nthe year 1994 as the International Year of Sport and of\r\nthe Olympic Ideal.\r\nThe Romanian Olympic Committee, which in 1994\r\ncelebrated its eightieth anniversary, reacted\r\nenthusiastically to the International Olympic Committee’s\r\nappeal concerning that commemoration by organizing\r\nsports programmes as well as cultural programmes, which\r\nwere favourably received by the public in its country. The\r\nrespect and credibility which the Olympic Movement\r\nenjoys in the eyes and the hearts of billions of people\r\nthroughout the world made it possible for the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) to put forward\r\nthe proposal to respect an Olympic Truce inspired by the\r\nancient Greek tradition of ekecheria.\r\nThe Romanian people, which was passionately\r\nfollowing the Olympic Games in Sarajevo, was a stunned\r\nwitness to the massacre committed on the outskirts of and\r\nwithin this Olympic city, barely a thousand kilometres\r\nfrom Romania. And, unfortunately, such conflict\r\nsituations continue in various parts of the world. It is\r\nentirely logical and very human to ask that the guns\r\nshould fall silent, at least for the brief moment — the 16\r\ndays — of Olympic competition in 1996. I paraphrase\r\nNeil Armstrong: this would be a small step on the long\r\nroad to peace throughout the world.\r\nIn July 1996 we shall celebrate, in Atlanta, the\r\ncentenary of the Olympic Games. More than 100 nations\r\nwill be there — literally, through the presence of their\r\nathletes — and billions of people will be there in spirit,\r\nside by side with the athletes. We call on those involved\r\nin struggles — not in the arena but on the various\r\nfronts — to stop the massacres and, instead, to follow the\r\ngames and note that it is possible to solve rivalries other\r\nthan through war.\r\nLet us hope that 1996 — the year of the Olympic\r\ncentennial — will mark not only the organization of the\r\nmost prestigious Olympic Games ever but also the\r\nfulfilment of that golden dream of the initiator of the\r\nmodern Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertain: “May sport\r\nlead to peace.”\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Swaziland, His Royal\r\nHighness Prince Sobandla, Minister for Home Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland.\r\nPrince Sobandla (Swaziland): The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland is not being deliberately redundant in repeating\r\nthe words of other representatives in congratulating Mr.\r\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his deserved\r\nelection to the presidency of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly at its historic fiftieth session. The members of\r\nMr. do Amaral’s team too are worthy of our\r\ncongratulations.\r\nThe theme of this meeting is clearly spelt out in the\r\ntitle of the agenda item. But before voicing the sentiments\r\nof my country I should like, through you, Mr. President, to\r\nexpress our sympathy and sorrow over the sad events that\r\nhave occurred in the State of Israel. The manner in which\r\nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin lost his life reminded me of\r\nour father, King Sobhuza II, who said that out of violence\r\ncomes no peace.\r\nWe, the small and developing nations, have been\r\naccused of employing the principles of peace and dialogue\r\nas a shield to protect ourselves from those whose powers,\r\nboth in aggression and in defence, are mightier than ours.\r\nThis may be true, but we still hold to the traditional\r\npractice of solving problems by peaceful means. This\r\napplies to personal misunderstandings, party political\r\nsquabbles and international disputes.\r\nIt is not only Israel that is in pain today. A number of\r\npeoples in different countries are suffering from various ills,\r\nsome of them the results of natural causes. We hope that\r\nthe Almighty will heal the wounds of the people of the\r\nPhilippines following the typhoon about which we have all\r\nheard so much.\r\nComing to the agenda item with which the Assembly\r\nis dealing today, one cannot disregard historical records,\r\nwhich reveal that the Olympic Truce was established, in\r\nancient Greece, in the ninth century before Christ. This was\r\nmarked by the signing of a Treaty between Kings —\r\nIphitos of Elis, Cleosthones of Pisa and Lycurgus of Sparta\r\n— which was subsequently ratified by all the other Greek\r\ncity-States. In part, the Truce provided that athletes, artists\r\nand their families and ordinary pilgrims could travel safely\r\nto participate in or attend the Olympic Games and to return\r\nto their respective homes.\r\nTalking of contemporary experiences, I should say\r\nthat I was privileged to lead my country’s athletes to the\r\nOlympics in Barcelona, where we were joined by the\r\nKing of Spain and other dignitaries from all over the\r\nworld. The same happened when we went to Victoria,\r\nCanada, for the Commonwealth Games, where the Queen\r\nof the United Kingdom tirelessly worked to promote\r\nsports. Just two months ago Africans gathered in\r\nHarare, where President Mugabe hosted the biggest and\r\nmost successful games ever held on African soil.\r\nNone of our athletes came home from any of these\r\nencounters with regrets. We could not have experienced\r\nthe same warmth, tolerance, love and appreciation for\r\nothers within the boundaries of our individual countries.\r\nNo community, no society, no country has a monopoly on\r\ngiving young people throughout the world these treasured\r\nexperiences. That is why I believe that we need one\r\nanother for the promotion of knowledge and peace.\r\nSpeaking in my capacity as Chairman of the\r\nSupreme Council of Sports in Africa, Zone VI, I can\r\nconfidently say that the 10 countries in the region\r\nappreciate the manner in which the Charter of the United\r\nNations takes cognizance of the need to develop friendly\r\nrelations between nations, on the basis of respect for the\r\nprinciple of equal rights, and to take other appropriate\r\nmeasures to strengthen universal peace.\r\nIt is heartening also to note that, in its\r\nresolution 49/29 of 7 December 1994, the General\r\nAssembly called upon my colleagues — Ministers for\r\nsports and culture — and to other officials to participate\r\nin the debate that is taking place today. The Olympic\r\nIdeal has been aptly described by the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n“The Olympic Ideal is a hymn to tolerance and\r\nunderstanding between people and cultures. It is an\r\ninvitation to competition, but competition with\r\nrespect for others. In its way, Olympism is a school\r\nfor democracy. In other words, there is a natural link\r\nbetween the ethic of the Olympic Games and the\r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations.”\r\nThe Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nstrongly advocates such a spirit, and I am here to support\r\nthat spirit. The Olympic Truce must be given its rightful\r\nplace in promoting dialogue, reconciliation and the search\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nfor long-lasting solutions in order to allow peace to reign\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nOver the years it has often been stated that one\r\nshould not mix sport with politics. Recent events, however,\r\nhave indicated the contrary. Sport, if properly used,\r\narguably provides the best therapy for creating peace, and\r\nbringing balance and sobering effects in times of strife.\r\nWe therefore call upon our colleagues all over the\r\nworld to review their attitudes towards sport and to exploit\r\nfully the avenues they provide in the quest for a peaceful\r\nworld. Our indifferent approach to youth and sport needs\r\nthorough scrutiny. One may argue that because of our\r\nstrained fiscal resources, especially in the developing world,\r\nit is impossible to elevate sport to its rightful pedestal. A\r\nfull reappraisal of the role of sport may convince us that\r\nsport is a worthwhile investment if we are to bequeath\r\nsucceeding generations a world in which peace and the\r\ndignity of mankind are secured.\r\nThe Government of Swaziland is appreciative of the\r\nrole played by sport in the international arena. In this\r\nconnection, our sports policy recognizes that sport helps\r\nfoster friendship. I am the first to admit that we have not\r\ndone enough to transform the Olympic Ideal into the\r\nOlympic reality. Introspection is inevitable, therefore, if we\r\nare to be able to face the future without trepidation. We\r\nhave to invest our money in youth and sports for a better\r\nworld. Let this also be put on record: we owe the world\r\nand the future to our youth. that is why every Government\r\nshould offer youth the best, which can be done precisely\r\nthrough sports.\r\nI wish to address the Assembly on the question of\r\ndrugs and the intensity with which this problem has\r\nengulfed the whole world. I would be remiss if I omitted to\r\nmention a sad phenomenon which has infiltrated the\r\nsporting fraternity: drug abuse by youth and the sports\r\nfraternity, which is undoubtedly inimical to the interests of\r\nthese groups and the international community at large. If\r\nthis issue is not addressed it will sound a death knell to the\r\nOlympic Ideal and will never allow the Ideal to mature into\r\na reality.\r\nAs some of my brothers and sisters have done, I call\r\nupon Governments, the United Nations and the International\r\nOlympic Committee to rise up and deal swiftly, decisively\r\nand collectively with this scourge. Let us make concerted\r\nefforts to combat this menace; otherwise, the future of our\r\nyouth may end up in untold peril.\r\nLet us interpret to the fullest the old adage that says\r\nprevention is better than cure.\r\nMay I conclude by stating that the Government of\r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland associates itself with the Ideal,\r\nas it coincides with its age-old principle of mutual\r\ncoexistence. I hereby affirm my Government’s willingness\r\nto cooperate in the fullest realization of this Ideal, as\r\nendorsed by the Assembly of Heads of State of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity pursuant to resolution\r\nCM/Res.28(LXII), which was adopted in Addis Ababa by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity Council of Ministers on\r\n23 June 1995.\r\nMr. Bhandari (Nepal): We are deeply shocked by\r\nthe news of the brutal and barbarous assassination of the\r\nIsraeli Prime Minister, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin. I wish to\r\nexpress heartfelt condolences, on behalf of my delegation\r\nand the people and the Government of Nepal, to the\r\nbereaved family and to the people and the Government of\r\nIsrael. Mr. Rabin lived and died for peace.\r\nIn pursuance of the relevant resolution adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, we are\r\ncommitted to emphasizing and re-emphasizing the role of\r\nsports and the Olympic Ideal in building a peaceful and\r\nbetter world. This is not only a question of commitment;\r\nit is also the truth of our conviction.\r\nIn the last few decades, Nepal has been steadily\r\nimproving in its scope and quality of sport. Like most\r\ncountries, Nepal believes that the development of sports\r\nactivities will in effect help the development of a vibrant\r\nand energetic society. Sport is fun and excitement, joy\r\nand recreation. Above all, it is creative, in the sense that\r\nauthentic sportsmen and sportswomen create an enduring\r\natmosphere of peace and well-being.\r\nMy delegation would like to suggest that ekecheria,\r\nor Olympic Truce, should not be limited to the cessation\r\nof all hostilities during the Olympic Games. The young\r\nmen and young women who make an impressive\r\ngathering during the Olympic Games should pledge to\r\nwork for peace and harmony in the world throughout the\r\nrest of their lives. For they know that the psychology of\r\nvictory and defeat is more illusory than real. They know\r\nthat depression, bitterness or elation is but a transient\r\nphase.\r\nComing as we do from the country of Lord Buddha,\r\nthe foremost apostle of peace the world has ever known,\r\nour mind-set is consciously and subconsciously influenced\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nby his message of universal love and friendship. We cannot\r\nbut be excited by the General Assembly’s reaffirmation that\r\nthe Olympic Ideal is to promote international understanding\r\namong the youth of the world, through sport and culture, in\r\norder to advance the harmonious development of\r\nhumankind, and by the recognition that the Olympic Ideal\r\nis relevant to the United Nations Year for Tolerance, which\r\nis being commemorated in 1995. Nepal cannot be apathetic\r\nor indifferent to the measures for peace and prosperity that\r\nthe United Nations has taken in its resolutions.\r\nOne of the purposes of the United Nations, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter, is the achievement of international\r\ncooperation in solving international problems of an\r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, and in\r\npromoting and encouraging respect for human rights and\r\nfor fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to\r\nrace, sex, language or religion. In this context, my\r\ndelegation is pleased to note that 1995 has been declared\r\nthe United Nations Year for Tolerance, which has been\r\ncelebrated throughout the world with programmes jointly\r\norganized by the International Olympic Committee, various\r\nrelevant agencies of the United Nations, particularly the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), international sports federations\r\nand national Olympic committees.\r\nMy delegation also appreciates the efforts of the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee to mobilize athletes and\r\nyouth in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations and the United Nations Year for Tolerance. We\r\nexpress our gratitude to the International Olympic\r\nCommittee for its humanitarian activities, such as food-\r\nrelief assistance to children in conflict situations, in\r\ncooperation with the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In keeping with the\r\ntradition of the Olympic Ideal, Nepalese youth will\r\nparticipate, with other fellow sportsmen and women from\r\nall over the world, in the observance of the Olympic Truce\r\nin the forthcoming Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta next\r\nyear in order to promote international understanding and the\r\nmaintenance of peace in the world.\r\nThe Olympic Ideal originated during democratic rule\r\nin Athens, and we are certain that it will be sustained fully\r\nand entirely in a dispensation that is essentially democratic.\r\nMy delegation believes that the proper use of the Olympic\r\nIdeal is necessary for the building of a more peaceful and\r\nbetter world. This ideal, established more than 2,000 years\r\nago and dedicated to building a world in which people are\r\nwhole and healthy in body and in mind, can be an effective\r\nforce in the creation of a harmonious new world order.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call on the representative of Portugal, His Excellency\r\nMr. Júlio Miranda Calha, Secretary of State for Sports.\r\nMr. Miranda Calha (Portugal): I wish at the outset\r\nto express the condolences and sympathy of my country\r\nto the Israeli people and to the family of Prime Minister\r\nYitzhak Rabin. He will remain in our memory as a great\r\nstatesman who dedicated his life to the cause of peace,\r\nand we sincerely hope that this terrible loss will not affect\r\nthe ongoing peace process in the Middle East.\r\nIt is a great honour for me to address this Assembly,\r\nas I believe that the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, together with the celebration of the International\r\nYear for Tolerance, constitute an excellent opportunity for\r\nus to underline the continued importance of contributing\r\nto a more peaceful and better world through sports and\r\nthe Olympic Ideal. Activities carried out in the name of\r\nthis ideal have played a decisive role in the promotion of\r\nunderstanding among nations, especially since the end of\r\nthe Second World War.\r\nThe General Assembly, by declaring 1994 the Year\r\nof Sport and the Olympic Ideal, paid tribute to the\r\ncentennial of the foundation of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee (IOC). This decision represented a just\r\nrecognition of the activities undertaken by the Committee\r\nand of those who have anonymously and selflessly\r\ncontributed to developing the modern sports world.\r\nThe Olympic Movement not only was the\r\nspringboard for the organization of modern sports but is\r\nthe glue that keeps them together. Its activities, as the\r\nPresident of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch, has\r\ndefined them, are both permanent and universal. It was\r\nthanks to this movement, supported by many countries,\r\nthat an international network of activities and\r\nrelationships was created and consolidated, based on\r\nideals that promote human ennoblement and on rules\r\ndeeply rooted in tolerance and loyalty. Only in this way\r\nhas it been possible to attain the current spectacular levels\r\nof excellence and high standards that are normally\r\nassociated with today’s international competitions.\r\nAlongside these notable achievements, the activities\r\nundertaken by countries through sports associations and\r\nthe Olympic Movement have contributed decisively to the\r\ncreation of a sports culture among millions of people,\r\nwho are searching, through sports, for physical\r\nwell-being, social contacts, contact with nature or merely\r\nan escape from the stress of daily life. These\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\ncharacteristics allow athletes to be particularly conscious of\r\nthe need to defend the principle of respect for human\r\ndignity. Consequently, sports and the Olympic Ideal have\r\nnow been linked to the major concerns of humanity, such\r\nas the protection of the environment, the pursuit of peace,\r\nthe prevention of disease and the alleviation of human\r\nsuffering.\r\nIt is with great pride and satisfaction that my country\r\nhas joined in sponsoring the draft resolution before us\r\ntoday, introduced by the representative of the United States\r\nof America, which appeals to Member States to support the\r\nactivities of the International Olympic Committee,\r\nespecially those that seek to strengthen ethics and fair play.\r\nThe draft resolution also calls for the reaffirmation of the\r\nobservance of an Olympic Truce during the Games of the\r\nXXVI Olympiad. Indeed, thanks to the appeal already made\r\nby this Assembly and to the efforts of the International\r\nOlympic Committee, the Marquis de Samaranch was able\r\nto visit Sarajevo at the time of the Lillehammer Winter\r\nGames of 1994.\r\nIn this context, the newly elected Portuguese\r\nGovernment welcomes all initiatives developed by the\r\nUnited Nations and the International Olympic Committee,\r\nand is willing to participate fully in them. Portugal has been\r\nactively involved in peace-keeping activities of the United\r\nNations in Angola, in Mozambique and in the former\r\nYugoslavia, either through diplomatic initiatives or by\r\nsending peace-keepers to the field.\r\nPortugal intends to pursue its efforts towards the\r\nachievement of world peace and international development,\r\nand considers that a decision to put these matters before\r\nthis Assembly on a biennial basis constitutes a very positive\r\nstep. The Atlanta Olympic Games are approaching. The\r\nobservance of the Olympic Truce during the 16 days of the\r\ncompetition is a major challenge faced by international\r\nsports leaders and those responsible for world diplomacy.\r\nIt can constitute an important move towards conflict\r\nresolution and provide an opportunity for the parties to\r\nconflicts to work out their differences.\r\nIt is up to us to ensure that sports and the Olympic\r\nIdeal continue to contribute towards a better world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Senegal, Mr. Papa\r\nBaboucar Mbaye, Vice-President in charge of International\r\nRelations, National Council of Youth of Senegal.\r\nMr. Mbaye (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe theme of our meeting today, “Building a peaceful\r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic Ideal”\r\npricks the universal conscience about the need for men\r\nand women of goodwill to promote a framework of peace\r\nand solidarity at every level. Sport and the Olympic Ideal\r\nare the essential ingredient in this undertaking, as history\r\nand modern practice prove every day.\r\nAt a time when the world seems to be heading\r\nstraight for an era of radical upheaval, when peace is\r\nbeing assailed on all sides, respect for the Olympic Truce\r\nis more urgently needed than ever before.\r\nOn the eve of the Games of the XXVI Olympiad,\r\nwhich will be held in Atlanta next year, Senegal solemnly\r\nreaffirms its support for the United Nations initiative and\r\nurges Member States to adopt the draft resolution now\r\nbefore the Assembly.\r\nThe youth of my country also calls on the glorious\r\nInternational Olympic Committee and States to place\r\nparticular emphasis on education programmes for peace\r\nbased on the recognized virtues of sport and the Olympic\r\nIdeal, which have become the most reliable bastions of\r\nsocial interaction, tolerance and understanding among\r\npeoples.\r\nOn the threshold of the third millennium, we venture\r\nto hope that the ideals of de Coubertin and the Olympic\r\nspirit will continue to inspire humankind’s onward march\r\ntowards universal harmony.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Canada, Mr. Adam\r\nOstry, Director-General of Sport Canada.\r\nMr. Ostry (Canada): First, I wish to transmit to the\r\nAssembly, on behalf of the Canadian delegation, our most\r\nprofound and sincere condolences on the death of Israeli\r\nPrime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. The world has lost a great\r\nstatesman dedicated to peace and reconciliation. The\r\nprayers of the Canadian people are with the family of\r\nPrime Minister Rabin and with the people of Israel.\r\nIt is a distinct pleasure and a great honour for me to\r\nspeak on behalf of Canada on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\r\nCanada is committed to supporting the principles\r\nembodied in the draft resolution on the Olympic Ideal.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nCanada has a long and distinguished history of support\r\nfor Olympism and the Olympic Movement. Great national\r\npride was expressed from coast to coast in Canada when\r\nwe hosted first the 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics and\r\nthen the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary. Canada’s\r\ncommitment has not ceased renewing itself. Our bids to\r\nhost the 1996 Summer Olympics in Toronto and the 2002\r\nWinter Olympics in Québec City attest to our sustained\r\nloyalty to the Olympic Ideal. Indeed, this loyalty was also\r\nunderscored by the strong commitment from all levels of\r\ngovernment in Canada to providing direct financial\r\nassistance to both Toronto and Québec City had they been\r\nsuccessful bidders.\r\nCanada’s ongoing commitment to Olympism expresses\r\nitself in other ways as well. In Québec City, in the spring\r\nof 1995, Canada hosted the International Congress of the\r\nInternational Sporting Press Association (AIPS) and the\r\nWorld Forum on Physical Activity. Canada has\r\ndemonstrated a strong commitment to the principles of fair\r\nplay and ethics in sport, notably through policies and\r\nprogrammes to increase access by women to sport and\r\nthrough our efforts in relation to anti-doping. In July 1994,\r\nCanada endorsed the Brighton Declaration on Women in\r\nSport on the occasion of the Jeux de la Francophonie in\r\nParis.\r\nCanada hosted the First World Conference on\r\nAnti-Doping in Sport in 1988, from which the International\r\nOlympic Anti-Doping Charter was created. As a founding\r\nsignatory of the International Anti-Doping Memorandum,\r\nwe are proud of our collaboration with France, Norway,\r\nNew Zealand, the United Kingdom and Australia. Our\r\ndomestic doping-control programme conducts over\r\n2,500 tests annually; 75 per cent of these are random and\r\nunannounced.\r\n(Spoke in French)\r\nCanada takes this opportunity to congratulate\r\nMr. Guy Drut, France’s Minister for Youth and Sport, on\r\nhis statement today, particularly with regard to anti-doping.\r\nAs a past Olympic champion, Mr. Drut is clearly in a most\r\ndistinguished position to argue both in France and at this\r\nforum in favour of fair, equitable and ethical sport. Canada\r\nsupports the French message concerning international\r\nstandardization and harmonization in regard to anti-doping.\r\nWe must all, in particular the large countries that have\r\nsufficient resources to do so, support the efforts of our\r\nNational Olympic Committees to introduce strict\r\nanti-doping measures, including unannounced testing, within\r\ntheir respective domestic sporting federations. Canada also\r\nhopes that other United Nations Member States will\r\nreinforce their mutual cooperation in combating doping at\r\nthe international level.\r\n(Spoke in English):\r\nBy including in the General Assembly’s agenda\r\ndiscussion by the Assembly on “Building a peaceful and\r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic Ideal”, we\r\nconfirm that all countries have a great capacity for\r\nmobilizing collective efforts in sport to advance the\r\nharmonious development of humankind.\r\nThe international Olympic Movement has an\r\nenormous capacity to contribute to the quality of human\r\nlife throughout the world. Canada is committed to\r\nworking with the International Olympic Committee and\r\nits programmes to advance the values inherent in\r\nOlympism.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Greece,\r\nMr. Vassilis Kaskarelis.\r\nMr. Kaskarelis (Greece): Allow me first on behalf\r\nof my Government to express our deepest condolences\r\nand profound sympathy to the family, and to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Israel on the tragic loss of\r\nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an eminent statesman and\r\nleader dedicated to peace and reconciliation.\r\nI welcome with great pleasure the Assembly’s\r\ndiscussion of the draft resolution before us at a time when\r\nthe United Nations is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary,\r\nand honour once more the Olympic Ideals of peace,\r\nbrotherhood and unity among peoples. In a troubled era\r\nin which disputes, conflicts, inequalities, tensions and\r\nenvironmental crises wreak havoc on the quality of life,\r\nwe meet today to discuss athletics and the Olympic Ideal.\r\nBy so doing, and by adopting the draft resolution before\r\nus, we shall send the message that there is still an\r\neagerness for communication and dialogue.\r\nThe Olympic Ideal has been living in the hearts of\r\nthe Greek people for more than 30 centuries. That is not\r\nto say that through our long history we have not been\r\nsubjected to the vicissitudes of mankind: we have\r\nexperienced untold discord, conflict and disunity.\r\nNevertheless, however remote the goal of building a\r\nworld based on the rule of law, justice and peace may be,\r\nthe continuity of the Olympic Ideal has always provided\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nus with a source of inspiration and hope, for the present as\r\nwell as for the future.\r\nSince its birth in 776 B.C., the Olympic Ideal has been\r\na token of man’s noble struggle to exceed his limits. In its\r\nframework, competition stands for virtuous antagonism. It\r\nexpresses the desire to compete by peaceful means, to aim\r\nat peaceful targets, and to attain victory through individual\r\neffort and the exercise of the body and the mind. It is never\r\na means to exterminate an enemy. It contributes to the\r\nenhancement of our overall potentialities.\r\nThe draft resolution’s call for world peace during the\r\nWinter and the Summer Olympic Games has its roots in the\r\nconcept of ekecheria — the Olympic Truce established by\r\nour ancestors. Even though it constitutes only a small step\r\ntowards world peace, we should not forget that a long path\r\nis indeed made of small steps.\r\nThe Olympic Games in ancient Greece were convened\r\nfor the day of the first full moon after the summer solstice,\r\nwhich today coincides with mid-July. This period of time\r\nwas called ierominia — holy month. On the eve of the\r\nierominia, special envoys travelled throughout Greece\r\ncarrying the message of peace and the Olympic Truce.\r\nPeace was recognized as a fundamental prerequisite for the\r\nGames. For 40 days before and after the Games, all\r\nhostilities ceased and all persecution of individuals was\r\nprohibited.\r\nAlexander the Great often stressed that the city of\r\nOlympia should be regarded as the capital of all Greeks. He\r\nspread not only the Greek spirit, but also the athletic ideal.\r\nHe built athletic stadiums and organized athletic games. He\r\nencouraged everyone to share the virtues of the perfection\r\nof the body, the nobility of the spirit and the kindness of\r\nthe soul, as well as the values of noble emulation, freedom\r\nand individual distinction emanating from honest victory.\r\nIn the year 393, Byzantine Emperor Theodosius I put\r\nan end to the Olympic Games because he regarded them as\r\nan expression of paganism. Many efforts were subsequently\r\nmade for the revival of the Olympic Games, which finally\r\nled to the first modern Games held in the Kalimarmaro\r\nStadium of Athens in 1896. These Games were the result\r\nof the joint efforts of the Frenchman, Baron Pierre de\r\nCoubertin and the Greek, Demetrios Vikelas, who became\r\nthe first President of the International Olympic Committee.\r\nIt is a fact that the athletic movement has over the\r\nyears gone through many phases and crises. It is also true\r\nthat athletics is the expression of a powerful and universal\r\nreality which brings a major influence to bear on the\r\nwider social environment as a means of education in the\r\nframework of school athletics, as a means of health and\r\nrecreation for all sexes and ages in the framework of\r\nmass participation in sports, and as a means of\r\ncommunication, brotherhood, solidarity and peace in the\r\nframework of competitive sports.\r\nThis three-dimensional social role of athletics has\r\ncontributed to its development as a lasting cultural value.\r\nHowever, the world athletic movement is today suffering\r\na dangerously deepening multifaceted crisis. It is an\r\nideological crisis, because the philosophical nucleus of the\r\nancient Greek spirit is being superseded by extreme\r\ncommercialization, which contributes to turning fans into\r\nhooligans, athletes into ruthless professionals and sporting\r\nclubs into trading companies. It is an operational crisis,\r\nsince athletic records do not reflect the noble endeavour\r\nto extend the boundaries of the body and the mind, but\r\npolitical, business and, occasionally, racial objectives.\r\nFinally, it is an organizational crisis, since we seem\r\nunable to confront the plagues of violence and the abuse\r\nof prohibited substances.\r\nOn the other hand, the urge for physical exercise\r\nplays an ever-increasing role in our everyday life. The\r\ntransformation of our lifestyle and the urbanization of our\r\nsocieties, in conjunction with the anguish and stress of\r\nour technological age, highlight the need to develop a\r\npowerful athletics movement, in which the largest\r\npossible number of people will be able to actively\r\nparticipate. We have the binding obligation to reconsider\r\nthe way in which the heritage of the Olympic Movement\r\nand of ancient Olympia is being put to use around the\r\nworld, for we seem to have forgotten the sacred ideals,\r\nlimiting ourselves to judging everything and everyone\r\naccording to cheap materialistic criteria.\r\nThe Greek people wholeheartedly wish the city of\r\nAtlanta success in hosting the Olympic Games next\r\nsummer. But we also hope that the world in general, and\r\nthe International Olympic Committee in particular will\r\nacknowledge the moral debt they owe to Greece and to\r\nthe Olympic Ideal, and give my country the honour of\r\nhosting the Games. It is indeed inconceivable that no\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nOlympic Games should have been held, during the\r\ntwentieth century, in the country where they were born and\r\nwhich has served as a major source of inspiration to the\r\nhistory of the modern Olympics.\r\nGreece stands ready to host the Olympic Games at the\r\nturn of the century, and to invite world youth to take part\r\nin Games of friendship, civilization and peace, so as to\r\ninaugurate a new phase of the revitalization of the Olympic\r\nIdeal.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call next on His Excellency Mr. Hans Peter Manz, Deputy\r\nPermanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations.\r\nMr. Manz (Austria): Before addressing the item we\r\nare debating today, I should like to convey, on behalf of\r\nmy delegation, our heartfelt condolences to the Government\r\nand the people of Israel. The loss of Prime Minister Rabin\r\nto a senseless act of murder has shocked and saddened the\r\npeople of Austria. We share the grief of his family and all\r\nof Israel.\r\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, we should also reflect on how closely\r\nrelated the underlying ideas of its foundation are to a much\r\nolder concept: that of the Olympic Games. As naive as it\r\nmay appear at times, the notion of competing peacefully in\r\nsports rather than challenging each other’s strength by\r\nengaging in warfare has certainly lost none of its relevance\r\nand appeal. Its link to the United Nations is obvious, and to\r\nunderline its importance in this forum seems only\r\nappropriate.\r\nToday, as in ancient Greece, the Olympic Games\r\ncontribute to international understanding and mutual\r\nrespect. Rivalry and aggression appear to be inherent\r\nhuman features with a potential for devastating effect.\r\nEngaging in sports allows us to channel those forces in a\r\nconstructive way and is therefore a powerful manifestation\r\nof competitive yet harmonious human interaction. Austria\r\nis proud to have hosted the Olympic Winter Games in\r\nInnsbruck in 1964 and 1976.\r\nHowever, sports are not only a peaceful way to enter\r\ninto competition with other individuals. There is another\r\naspect to any sports activity: the effect of sports on the\r\nindividual itself. It is a way to develop physical and mental\r\nskills, which in turn foster people’s health and self-esteem.\r\nBoth factors are crucial to an individual’s well-being and\r\ntherefore to society’s as well.\r\nIn this context, I should like to stress particularly the\r\nSpecial Olympics and their invaluable function for the\r\ndisabled. Individuals who often find themselves\r\nmarginalized and even humiliated by society are given the\r\nchance by way of sports to be at the centre of attention,\r\nto feel large-scale support and to become heroes. The\r\nself-esteem acquired by those preparing for and\r\nparticipating in the Special Olympics is a rare but lasting\r\nexperience for all directly or indirectly involved. Austria,\r\nas a former host country of the Special Olympics, will\r\ncontinue to promote this specific concept as a particularly\r\nimportant strategy for the full integration of the disabled\r\ninto society.\r\nThe contribution of sports to people’s health and\r\nself-esteem is also of eminent importance in the context\r\nof the international fight against drug abuse. The\r\ninvolvement of young people in sports becomes most\r\nrelevant in this context. We therefore welcome the\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation agreements between the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) and the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme as well as\r\nother relevant bodies. The Vienna-based Drug Control\r\nProgramme is very active in providing training courses,\r\ncreating manuals and offering technical assistance in this\r\nfield, all of which, we believe, are viable factors in\r\nhelping youth to withstand the deceptive attraction of\r\ndrugs and which we therefore strongly support.\r\nAustria also welcomes the many activities of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in sports all over the world\r\nthat aim at enhancing a society free of drug abuse. We\r\nthus encourage the IOC, in collaboration with local and\r\nnational committees, to help promote the importance of a\r\ndrug-free society at the forthcoming Games in Atlanta.\r\nThe eve of the centenary of the revival of the\r\nOlympic Games in 1896 in Athens presents an excellent\r\nopportunity to remember the ancient Greek tradition of\r\nthe Olympic Truce. May this spirit be reflected in the\r\nforthcoming Olympic Games. May the Olympic Games of\r\nthe future be an example of harmonious competition\r\nbetween individuals and nations and a rallying point for\r\nthe promotion of peace in the world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call next on the representative of Colombia, Mr. Luis\r\nAlfonso Muñoz Aguirre, Director-General of ColDeportes.\r\nMr. Muñoz Aguirre (Colombia) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): Peace and development are permanent\r\nthemes in the daily life of the United Nations. As the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nworld Organization celebrates its fiftieth anniversary, there\r\ncan be no better time to reaffirm the notion that the\r\nOlympic Ideal consists of promoting international\r\nunderstanding through sport and culture, in particular\r\namong young people everywhere, in order to promote the\r\nharmonious development of mankind.\r\nThe joint endeavours of the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC), such as recent\r\nmeetings on “Sport against drugs”, “Sport and the\r\nenvironment” and “Sport for all and health for all”, are\r\namong the reasons we support and invite other States to\r\nsupport draft resolution A/50/L.15 on building a peaceful\r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic Ideal.\r\nSport, recreation and the proper and beneficial use of\r\nleisure time are a right which my Government is committed\r\nto guaranteeing to all Colombians. The entry into force of\r\nthe national sports law, recently endorsed by President\r\nSamper, will allow us firmly and decisively to take the\r\ngreat plunge into sports to which our Government is\r\ncommitted. The current sport and recreation policy is aimed\r\nat fostering the integration of the population, promoting the\r\nparticipation of the student population at all levels, firmly\r\nsupporting physical education and encouraging formal\r\nsports and the follow-up to sports-training schools.\r\nThis law will help us to modernize and update sports\r\nstructures and to create processes for extending sports,\r\nrecreation and physical education to all municipalities of the\r\ncountry. It will also strengthen sports participation in the\r\neducational sector as part of the comprehensive\r\ndevelopment of young people. It stresses sports and\r\nrecreational programmes for ethnic groups, in particular\r\nindigenous groups, and for the disabled population. This\r\nwill allow for citizen participation and linkages in the\r\nsocialization process. Monitoring and supervisory\r\nmechanisms to be established to avoid violence and drug\r\nuse in sports are pillars of our national policy; that is why\r\nwe are working intensively on this subject.\r\nWe believe that it is essential to control doping.\r\nColombia will therefore soon establish a monitoring\r\nlaboratory which will allow us to take concrete measures\r\nagainst activities that are antithetical to sports. That is why\r\nwe recently sponsored an international meeting on this\r\nsubject. We recently asked the European Union to allow us\r\nto sign on to the anti-doping agreement that the European\r\ncountries have already adopted. We are a State member of\r\nthe Ibero-American Sports Council, an organization of 25\r\nStates created to establish mechanisms of cooperation,\r\nstrengthen relationships and exchange ideas on improving\r\ndevelopment.\r\nColombia recently became Chairman of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. Activities taken in the context of our\r\nnational policy should therefore have the coherence and\r\ndynamism to allow us to share our experience with the\r\ndeveloping world. Now is the time to ask the developed\r\ncountries to encourage specific programmes that will\r\nallow the developing world to integrate itself and to\r\ncontribute through sports to the peace and development of\r\nthe international community.\r\nI should also like to emphasize the effort now being\r\nmade by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) in favour of sport as\r\npart of the total education of the person. I also\r\ncongratulate the International Olympic Committee and its\r\nPresident, Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch, on the important\r\ntask it is carrying out, a task that we shall continue to\r\nsupport.\r\nColombia is enthusiastic and resolute in its support\r\nfor the draft resolution and undertakes to apply it because\r\nwe are aware that sport and culture are excellent tools for\r\nbringing about peace and coexistence between peoples\r\nand for improving conditions for continuing on the path\r\nof development in equality and justice.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call on the Permanent Representative of Jamaica, Miss\r\nPatricia Durrant.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): Allow me, Sir, on behalf\r\nof the Government and people of Jamaica, to express our\r\ndeepest condolences to the bereaved family and to the\r\nGovernment and people of Israel on the tragic loss of\r\nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to an assassin’s bullet.\r\nPrime Minister Rabin’s courage, his commitment to peace\r\nin the Middle East and his indefatigable and fearless\r\npursuit of normal relations between the peoples of the\r\nregion have been an inspiration to us all.\r\nI wish also to express our sincere sympathy with the\r\nGovernment and people of the Philippines at the tragic\r\nloss of life and destruction occasioned by Typhoon\r\nAngela. As someone from a part of the world that only a\r\nfew weeks ago experienced the fury of several hurricanes,\r\nwe feel with those who have lost loved ones, their homes\r\nand their livelihoods in this disaster.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nOn the eve of the centenary of the Olympic Games,\r\nwhich were revived in 1896, it is fitting that the United\r\nNations should devote special attention to the goal of the\r\nitem before us, “Building a peaceful and better world\r\nthrough sport and the Olympic Ideal”. In keeping with this\r\ngoal, the United Nations, through General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/11, revived the ancient Greek tradition of the\r\nOlympic Truce, which calls for all hostilities to cease\r\nduring the Games. The very ancient nature of this tradition\r\nis a significant reminder that wars and hostilities are not\r\nnew to this century; that from time immemorial countries\r\nhave seen the value of sport as a catalyst for peace.\r\nIn the past few years, we have seen an increase in\r\nconflicts motivated by racism, xenophobia and general\r\nintolerance. This reality was brought home clearly to\r\nathletes participating in the last Winter Olympics, in\r\nLillehammer, Norway, who recalled in sad irony and\r\ndisbelief that in just a few years the beautiful city of\r\nSarajevo, gracious host to the 1984 Winter Olympics, had\r\nbeen torn apart by conflict and hatred of a shocking\r\nintensity. The conflict in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia has become a symbol of similar ethnic conflicts\r\nin other parts of the world, and has focused attention on the\r\nneed for greater efforts to be made in favour of peace.\r\nThe Olympic Games, the Olympic Movement, the\r\nwhole spirit of the Olympic Ideal are meant to promote\r\nfriendship, mutual understanding and cooperation between\r\nthe peoples of the world and, by extension, between the\r\nnations. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali summed\r\nup this theme quite eloquently when he stated that\r\n“The Olympic Ideal is a hymn to tolerance and\r\nunderstanding between people and cultures. It is an\r\ninvitation to competition, but competition with respect\r\nfor others. In its way, Olympism is a school for\r\ndemocracy. ... there is a natural link between the ethic\r\nof the Olympic Games and the fundamental principles\r\nof the United Nations”.\r\nFor all these reasons, the Government of Jamaica\r\nsupports the call for the reaffirmation of the Olympic Truce\r\nduring the Centennial Games in Atlanta in July 1996. We\r\nalso support the reaffirmation of the Truce prior to each\r\nSummer and each Winter Olympic Games.\r\nThe Olympic Ideal places particular emphasis on\r\nmobilizing the world’s youth in the promotion of sport as\r\na vehicle for peace and understanding. This emphasis on\r\nyouth fits very well with the United Nations observance this\r\nyear of the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year,\r\nwhich the General Assembly commemorated just two\r\nweeks ago. At that time, my delegation stressed the\r\nimportance of youth to the development of our country\r\nand of the world, and outlined some of the measures\r\nbeing put in place to ensure the improved development of\r\nJamaica’s young people.\r\nJamaica has had a rich tradition of excellence in the\r\nfield of international sports since the 1940s, when our\r\ngreat track and field athletes captured the imagination of\r\nthe world at the Olympic Games even at that difficult\r\ntime, just after the Second World War. This tradition\r\ncontinues today.\r\nMany of our athletes come from very humble\r\nbackgrounds. It is in this humble environment that they\r\nfirst learn the lessons of discipline, fair play and\r\nteamwork, by participating in sports and other cultural\r\nactivities. It is one of the greatest miracles — even to\r\nJamaicans — that, even without financial resources,\r\nproper equipment and formal training, many of our young\r\npeople have risen to become world-class athletes. Some\r\nhave used their talents to assist with their educations, and\r\nall have recognized the value of sports — particularly\r\ncommunity sports — to their stability and to the stability\r\nof their communities and of the world.\r\nIn many communities in Jamaica, people set about\r\ncreating their own facilities and sports teams, and\r\norganizing tournaments, fully understanding the power of\r\nsports to calm tempers and counter juvenile delinquency.\r\nIn its national youth policy, the Government of Jamaica\r\nhas taken decisive steps to recognize the link between\r\nsports and cultural activities and the growth and\r\ndevelopment of our young people.\r\nYouth organizations are encouraged to play a key\r\nrole in designing programmes to facilitate the integration\r\nof youth into the community and to develop healthy\r\nlifestyles, which are the best protection against drug\r\nabuse. These programmes include participation in team\r\nsports. In addition, through its national sports policy, the\r\nGovernment of Jamaica emphasizes the provision of\r\ncompetition-level and community playing fields and\r\nfacilities; assistance to increase significantly the level of\r\nparticipation in selected sports in schools and at the\r\ncommunity level; and the encouragement of greater\r\nprivate-sector sponsorship of competition-level sports and\r\nin assisting national representation at international events.\r\nThese steps are in line with the continued work of\r\nthe International Olympic Committee in collaboration\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nwith organizations of the United Nations system, such as\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme (UNEP), the World Health Organization\r\n(WHO) and the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme\r\nThe International Conference on Sport against Drugs,\r\nheld in Rome earlier this year and organized by the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee and the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme, and the use of\r\nfamous personalities as goodwill ambassadors are an\r\nexcellent example of the use of sports to drive home the\r\nanti-drug message to young people.\r\nWe should also like to commend the work of the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee in its increased\r\nsurveillance of doping in sport. Jamaican sporting\r\nauthorities are adamantly against the use of medicaments to\r\nenhance athletic performance. Not only is this a dangerous\r\nand unhealthy practice for our athletes; it is also grossly\r\nunfair to other competitors.\r\nWe urge all athletes, as well as their coaches and\r\ndoctors, not to succumb to the temptation of taking\r\nperformance-enhancing drugs. It is not worth the risk, and\r\nrobs the person of his or her dignity as a fair competitor in\r\nthe spirit of the Olympics. More important, such habits\r\ndeveloped in play are carried over into work, as young\r\nathletes continue to cheat in their academic and business\r\nactivities.\r\nSport prepares young people for life. This, after all, is\r\nthe whole point of the Olympic Ideal and of the exercises\r\nwe are now conducting in our observance of that Ideal.\r\nThose in charge of young athletes need to remember that\r\nthe method by which those athletes are trained reveals the\r\ncharacter of the trainer and how the trainer conducts his or\r\nher affairs in all aspects of life. There are those who would\r\nscorn the attempts of the international community to spread\r\nthe spirit of Olympism in trying to achieve peace in the\r\nworld. My delegation is fully aware that the reasons for war\r\nare complex and that peace does not therefore come easily.\r\nBut there are many avenues for approaching peace. The\r\nOlympic Games provide a medium for international\r\ncommunication like few other events. Indeed, there are\r\nexpected to be some 190 countries present at the Summer\r\nOlympics in Atlanta.\r\nWe would urge any sceptics to bear these\r\nconsiderations in mind and to join in the promotion of the\r\nOlympic spirit, to the best of their ability. We urge the\r\ninternational community not to give up hope that lasting\r\npeace can be achieved in the world. We have in our\r\nlifetime witnessed the dismantling of the system of\r\napartheid, against which so many of us sportsmen and\r\nsportswomen fought valiantly. At the last Winter\r\nOlympics, in Lillehammer, a team from a tiny tropical\r\nisland which has experienced neither snow nor ice entered\r\nthe bobsled competition and finished ahead of many\r\nveterans of that sport. They were an inspiration to many\r\npeople worldwide.\r\nWe are very pleased to co-sponsor the draft\r\nresolution before us and call upon all members to support\r\nit.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call on the representative of Iraq, Mr. Maki Khamas,\r\nMember of the National Olympic Committee of Iraq.\r\nMr. Khamas (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nhave the honour to represent the Iraqi National Olympic\r\nCommittee in this international forum dedicated to the\r\nexchange of views and the search for the means whereby\r\na peaceful world may be established through sport.\r\nI should like first to extend sincere thanks to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which took the\r\ninitiative of requesting the inclusion of this item on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly in 1993, and has thus\r\nafforded us the opportunity to search for means to\r\npromote the Olympic Movement and thus to make it\r\npossible for the United Nations to explore new concepts\r\nand additional approaches in the service of peace and\r\nstability in the world.\r\nThe Olympic Movement, through its activities and\r\nprogrammes, has played an important role in the search\r\nfor world peace. It is appropriate to consolidate the\r\nrelationship between the Olympic Movement and the\r\nUnited Nations in the service of the common,\r\nfundamental objectives of the Charters of the United\r\nNations and the Olympic Movement. This could be\r\nachieved through teaching the world’s youth the virtues\r\nof peace, and the elaboration of a cooperative plan to\r\npromote sports relations amongst nations on the basis of\r\nfair competition and mutual respect, instead of\r\nconfrontation and domination.\r\nThe United Nations has set for itself a number of\r\nambitious objectives for the establishment of peace and\r\nensuring equality for all nations in the enjoyment of the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nfundamental human rights, which include the rights to\r\neducation for all, to health for all and to housing for all.\r\nThe promotion and development of physical education and\r\nsports for all are vital prerequisites for the attainment of\r\nthese objectives. Therefore, it is necessary for the United\r\nNations to promote international cooperation in the field of\r\nsports and physical education, and to immunize it against\r\nthe negative political effects generated through the\r\npursuance of self-interest by certain international quarters.\r\nIn this regard, mention should be made of the coercive\r\nmeasures imposed by the Security Council against Iraq,\r\nwhich have run counter to and worked against the\r\nattainment of these objectives. For five years now, my\r\ncountry has been subjected to a comprehensive embargo\r\nwhich has impacted negatively on all aspects of life,\r\nincluding sports. It has become extremely difficult for Iraqi\r\nathletes to obtain sports equipment, uniforms, balls, nets,\r\ntraining equipment, or equipment for sports medicine. The\r\nembargo has also prevented many Iraqi teams from\r\nparticipation in various sports activities abroad, such as\r\ngames, conferences, and training camps, due to the scarcity\r\nof resources.\r\nThe embargo and the lack of adequate nutrition have\r\ndeprived athletes of the necessary means to realize their full\r\nathletic potentials. As a result, the number of sports teams\r\nhave declined, many sports clubs have been closed and\r\nmany sports tournaments, individual and collective, have\r\nbeen cancelled. That has led to an extremely serious\r\ndeterioration in sports activities in schools and universities.\r\nFurthermore, the Olympic Council for Asia, for narrow\r\npolitical reasons, suspended the membership of the Iraqi\r\nNational Olympic Committee in 1990. Iraq’s membership\r\nin that Council remains suspended without any justification,\r\nin contradiction to the fundamental values and principles of\r\nthe Olympic Movement.\r\nThese negative consequences of the embargo on sports\r\nand on every other aspect of life in Iraq place a legal\r\nresponsibility on the United Nations as well as a moral\r\nresponsibility on the International Olympic Committee and\r\nmake it incumbent on both the Organization and the\r\nCommittee to work for putting an end to this unjustified\r\ntragedy.\r\nThe manifestations we have just mentioned, as well as\r\nmany others, require us all to work closely together for the\r\nattainment of the common objectives of the United Nations\r\nand the International Olympic Committee which aim at\r\ncreating a world of peace and prosperity, free of the narrow\r\npolitical interests of this or that party, a world in which\r\nsport is not used as a political tool of policies dictated by\r\nthe narrow interests of certain international quarters.\r\nWe should like to take this opportunity to commend\r\nthe Marquis Juan Antonio Samaranch for his tireless\r\nefforts to keep sports independent of the policies of\r\nvested interests. From this rostrum we call upon all\r\nnations — large and small, strong and weak, rich and\r\npoor — to promote dialogue and to build bridges of hope\r\nand understanding between them all through sports and\r\nthrough observance of the humanitarian Olympic values\r\nof mutual understanding, friendship, solidarity, justice and\r\nequality, which eschew all forms of discrimination,\r\ndomination and coercion.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Japan, Mr.\r\nShunji Maruyama.\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan): The Government and\r\npeople of Japan are profoundly saddened by the\r\nassassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It is\r\nJapan’s earnest hope that the people of Israel will not\r\nallow this tragedy to discourage them and that they will\r\nremain committed to the peace process and ensure that\r\nPrime Minister Rabin’s desire for peace in the Middle\r\nEast will be realized.\r\nAs the host country for the next Winter Olympic\r\nGames, which will take place in Nagano in 1998, Japan\r\nwould like to express its great pleasure that the agenda\r\nitem entitled “Building a peaceful and better world\r\nthrough sport and the Olympic Ideal” is being considered\r\nat plenary meetings of the General Assembly in this the\r\nyear of the Beijing Conference on Women and the\r\nCopenhagen Summit, which focused on people-centred\r\ndevelopment, and the year in which we observed the\r\nUnited Nations Year for Tolerance and the tenth\r\nanniversary of International Youth Year. In addition, next\r\nyear, in Atlanta, we shall celebrate the centenary of the\r\nrevival of the Olympic Games in 1896. Clearly, it is a\r\nmost opportune moment to acknowledge the importance\r\nof sport in general and of the Olympics in particular.\r\nAll round the world, sport plays a prominent role in\r\nthe promotion of mutual understanding, friendship and\r\ngood will, and it is conducted under universal rules. It has\r\nenormous importance for this reason, and we are pleased\r\nthat the world’s most important sports authority — the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) — and the\r\nUnited Nations system are engaging in joint endeavours\r\nin areas such as the prevention of drug abuse.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nWe also welcome the efforts of national Ministries of\r\nYouth and Sport to strengthen educational programmes for\r\nyouth and to enhance the participation of women in all\r\naspects of the sports movement. It is essential, in particular,\r\nthat young people, who hold our future in their hands, join\r\nin efforts to build a more peaceful world. This, we believe,\r\nthey can do by participating in sports and, more\r\nimportantly, by living their lives in accordance with the\r\nprinciples that are at the heart of all sporting competition.\r\nThe world continues today to be racked by regional\r\nconflict, and ways must be found to address this challenge.\r\nThe Olympic Truce is a very useful, if temporary, means of\r\neffecting peace, and we are pleased that it has been agreed\r\nthat a Truce will be observed once again during the Nagano\r\nOlympic Games. Since the time of the ancient Greeks, the\r\ngoal of the Olympic Games has been to build a peaceful\r\nand better world and to enhance respect for human dignity.\r\nThat goal continues to deserve our full support.\r\nBy hosting the eighteenth Olympic Games, in Tokyo\r\nin 1964, and the eleventh Winter Games, in Sapporo in\r\n1972, Japan has demonstrated how deeply it believes in the\r\nOlympic Ideal. As I mentioned at the outset, Japan is\r\nprivileged to serve once again as host country — this time\r\nfor the eighteenth Winter Games. The venue, Nagano, is\r\nsituated at the foot of the Japanese Alps, in the heart of\r\nJapan — a place famous for its magnificent views and great\r\nnatural beauty. Preparations are already under way, with\r\nextensive support from the Government of Japan, and every\r\neffort is being made to ensure that these Games will be the\r\nmost smoothly run ever. We are convinced that the Nagano\r\nGames will inspire participants and observers alike to strive\r\nto realize the goals of the Olympics in their own lives and\r\nin the relations of their countries.\r\nWe have established three guidelines for the\r\norganization of the Games in Nagano. First, as these will be\r\nthe last Olympic Games to be held this century, they should\r\nbe not only a series of world-championship events but also\r\nan opportunity for youth and children — the men and\r\nwomen of the early part of the next century — to appear on\r\nthe world stage. Secondly, as the Winter Games are ice-\r\nand-snow events, we should try to feature the abundant\r\nnatural resources that Nagano has to offer. Thirdly, we are\r\ndetermined to organize this historic event in such a way as\r\nto ensure that it is a means of enabling everyone,\r\nindividually and collectively, to make a contribution to\r\npeace, harmony and friendship. Japan will be honoured to\r\nwelcome athletes and visitors alike to the Nagano Games.\r\nJapan wishes to express its deep respect for the work\r\nof the International Olympic Committee, and we welcome\r\nMr. Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of the IOC, to the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s deliberations. Throughout its\r\n100-year history, the IOC has contributed to the\r\npromotion of friendship and peace through sports, and the\r\ninternational community owes it a debt of gratitude.\r\nI should like to conclude my statement by quoting\r\nthe remarks of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali,\r\nthat were incorporated in the report of the International\r\nOlympic Committee on the International Year of Sport\r\nand the Olympic Ideal last year:\r\n“The Olympic Ideal is a hymn to tolerance and\r\nunderstanding between people and cultures. It is an\r\ninvitation to competition, but competition with\r\nrespect for others. In its way, Olympism is a school\r\nfor democracy. In other words, there is a natural link\r\nbetween the ethic of the Olympic Games and the\r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations.”\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Guyana, Mrs. Paulette\r\nCornette.\r\nMrs. Cornette (Guyana): I should like, first, to take\r\nthis opportunity to extend the condolences of the\r\nGovernment and people of Guyana to the Government\r\nand people of Israel and to the bereaved widow and other\r\nrelatives of the late Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak\r\nRabin, who was assassinated last Saturday. It is our hope\r\nthat Mr. Rabin will not have died in vain and that the\r\npeace process, which he had brought so far, will continue\r\nto progress, leading to lasting peace in that region.\r\nIn less than one year from now, in July 1996 in\r\nAtlanta, we will celebrate the centennial Olympic Games\r\nof the modern era. During that period over 200 nations of\r\nthe world will field athletes who will be participating in\r\nevery conceivable area of sporting activity. The important\r\ncontribution which sports and culture offer to the\r\nparticipants, the majority of whom are youths, by way of\r\nhealthy competition of body and mind can never be\r\noveremphasized.\r\nWe are equally well aware of the apparent ease with\r\nwhich athletes at national and international levels are able\r\nto interact, in defiance of all other obstacles, such as\r\nlanguage, race and religion. We are reminded that in\r\nkeeping with Olympic tradition, we will be making a\r\ngreat effort to observe during the Games an Olympic\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nTruce in the cause of peace. This initiative, which revives\r\nan ancient Greek tradition, is all the more valuable because\r\nit is completely in keeping with the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and promotes a spirit of fraternity and\r\nunderstanding between peoples.\r\nAs we in this Assembly are only too well aware,\r\nglobal peace and security continue to elude our grasp. The\r\nperiod of intense super-Power rivalry is thankfully now\r\nbehind us, and the world has retreated from the threat of\r\nnuclear annihilation. We are now confronted, however, by\r\nnumerous localized wars that resist all attempts at\r\nresolution. Witness the many factional conflicts that are\r\ncurrently in progress in Europe, Africa and other areas of\r\nthe world.\r\nCommendably, the United Nations and particularly the\r\nSecurity Council strive to bring peace and stability to these\r\ntroubled places. We are forced to recognize, however, that\r\nthe Organization’s success to date has been severely\r\ncircumscribed. While we are encouraged by new\r\nbreakthroughs in the various diplomatic and negotiating\r\nprocesses, we cannot escape the conclusion that new\r\nconcepts and fresh approaches are needed to deal with the\r\npersistence and proliferation of conflict.\r\nBy extending the principle of the ekecheria, or\r\nOlympic Truce, we can at least pray for some respite,\r\nhowever temporary, from the killings and destruction which\r\naccompany conflict. The Truce, as we know it, would\r\nnormally last for the period of the sporting event. During\r\nthat time national rivalries, jealousies and considerations of\r\npolitics, race, religion, wealth and social status were cast\r\naside. Kings competed with commoners for the honour of\r\nwinning the simple branch of wild olive which was given\r\nto each victor and which over the years has come to\r\nsymbolize peace.\r\nWith political commitment, however, the Olympic\r\nTruce, which was considered sacred by all participants, can\r\nbe prolonged indefinitely. We therefore call upon people of\r\ngoodwill everywhere to place at the forefront of their\r\nthoughts and action the principles that ekecheria and the\r\nOlympic Ideal seek to propagate.\r\nOf those currently engaged in conflict we ask that,\r\ndespite the urgencies and validity of the causes for which\r\nthey struggle, they show some regard for these higher\r\nprinciples that have been endorsed by the United Nations.\r\nThe fundamental principles of the Olympic Movement\r\nembrace the values and ideals of this Organization. It is\r\ntherefore possible for it to collaborate with us in the\r\ncampaign to achieve world peace. The movement has\r\nmade a valuable contribution towards building a better\r\nworld through sport. The United Nations, for its part, has\r\ntaken a major step in furthering its own efforts to foster\r\npeace and development, by its full acceptance and\r\nendorsement of the concept of the Olympic Truce.\r\nWe are pleased to note the appreciable effort which\r\nthe International Olympic Committee is making to\r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to several war-torn areas.\r\nSuch assistance enables the international community to\r\nmake the best possible response to the growing number of\r\nsituations which require its intervention. We wish to\r\ncommend the Committee for its positive contribution and\r\nto invite its continued involvement in the work of our\r\nOrganization. We have accordingly co-sponsored draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.15, which seeks to bring the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee into a closer\r\nrelationship with the United Nations system.\r\nThe occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, which the General Assembly is observing this\r\nyear, should see a concerted international effort to fulfil\r\nthe principal aim of its Charter, namely to rid this and\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nAs the Olympic torch moves from Barcelona to\r\nAtlanta, we must work to ensure that by the summer of\r\n1996, when the International Olympic Committee\r\nobserves its centennial, a permanent truce will be called\r\nto conflicts among and within nations. It will certainly be\r\na worthy achievement if at the dawn of the twenty-first\r\ncentury mankind can enter a new age of universal peace\r\nand harmony.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Cyprus, Mr. Demos\r\nGeorgiades, President of the Cyprus Sport Organization.\r\nMr. Georgiades (Cyprus): In a world faced with\r\nunabated turmoil, the ancient Greek spirit that gave rise\r\nto the Olympian ideal of athletic achievement and\r\nexcellence transcends the cultural and political boundaries\r\nthat divide human communities.\r\nThe Olympic Ideal continues to inspire us to this\r\nday. It shines like a beacon of hope, a guiding force\r\nunderpinning the fundamental values of society: peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It\r\nis a motivating element of human competitiveness without\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nrecourse to violent confrontation, an essential ingredient for\r\nthe preservation of universal values.\r\nConsideration of the present draft resolution by the\r\nGeneral Assembly during this year’s historic session is of\r\nparticular significance. It attests to the importance attached\r\nby the United Nations to the Olympian values for their\r\ncontribution towards the promotion of peace and the\r\nbetterment of the world through sports. It is by instilling the\r\nOlympic Ideals in our youth that cultural and political\r\ndiscord can be overcome.\r\nThe Olympic Ideal serves to promote international\r\nunderstanding among the youth of the world. In that way,\r\nthe necessary conditions for building harmony among\r\nnations are created. It is thus that the prevailing culture of\r\nconflict and misunderstanding can be mitigated.\r\nThe practice of sports offers a unique way to cultivate\r\nthe body, the mind and the soul. It is an activity that people\r\ncan engage in regardless of racial, cultural, political and\r\nother differences. The Olympic Ideal dissipates prejudice.\r\nNearly a century ago, Pierre de Coubertin was inspired\r\nby the same principles when he revived the Olympic\r\nGames in their land of origin — Greece. This is why it is\r\nonly appropriate that the International Olympic Committee\r\ngive serious consideration to the proposal of Greece to\r\norganize an Olympiad in the country that hosted the first\r\nmodern Olympic Games, the country that gave birth to the\r\noriginal Olympic spirit.\r\nSports have always played a central role in the\r\neducation system of Cyprus. Statistical data indicate that\r\nCyprus compares favourably with those nations that are\r\nmost active in the realm of sports.\r\nMy country, a land divided by foreign aggression and\r\noccupation, continues its struggle for peace and freedom.\r\nThis struggle is motivated by the same spirit that guided the\r\nfounders of the Olympic Games. It is a spirit driven by the\r\nideals of peaceful coexistence, mutual understanding and\r\nreconciliation.\r\nWe live in an era of uneasy transition, characterized\r\nby political and social upheaval. However, we must not\r\nallow our fears and concerns about the present to cloud our\r\nvision for the future. Our collective mission to promote the\r\nOlympic Ideal can only serve to fulfil the objectives of the\r\ndraft resolution — that is, promoting and preserving\r\ninternational understanding and cooperation through the\r\nactive participation of youth in sport.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Viet Nam, Mr. Le\r\nBuu, Director-General of the General Department of Sport\r\nand Physical Education of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Le Buu (Viet Nam) (spoke in Vietnamese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): I feel most\r\nhonoured to attend, on behalf of the Sport and Physical\r\nEducation and Olympic Movement of Viet Nam, at the\r\ninvitation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nand of the President of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee, this debate on agenda item 40, entitled\r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport and\r\nthe Olympic Ideal”, at the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOur people, living in a country that has undergone\r\nwars, strongly cherish a life of peace, independence and\r\nfreedom, and have an age-old tradition of sport. It is in\r\npeace that Vietnamese sport has been integrated into the\r\nmodern Olympic stream since the end of the 1970s.\r\nThe objective of Vietnamese sport is to build a\r\nmovement of popular sport, physical education and good\r\nhealth for everyone, and to expand relations of\r\ncooperation, friendship and development with friends all\r\nover the world.\r\nUnfortunately, suffering is still being experienced by\r\nmany peoples. I would earnestly recommend to the sports\r\nand physical-education leaders of every country that they\r\nstrive, as one of the important responsibilities within their\r\ncompetencies, to implement resolution 49/29, adopted at\r\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly on the\r\nOlympic Ideal. It aims to create a world of peace and\r\nstability in which all peoples may enjoy their fundamental\r\nrights — for example, the right to live in peace and\r\nequality, the right to development and the right to enjoy\r\nsporting exchanges and cooperation on sport between\r\ncountries and peoples.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour sincere thanks to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, the President of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee, the Association of National Olympic\r\nCommittees, the international sports federations and the\r\nsports and physical education organizations of various\r\ncountries for extending to Viet Nam their valuable\r\nassistance.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 6 November 1995\r\nVietnamese sport commits itself to do its best to make\r\na worthy contribution to the lofty cause of the Olympic\r\nIdeal; it commits itself to building a world of sport for\r\npeace and development.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker for today.\r\nIn order to hear the other speakers on the list and to\r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/50/L.15, the\r\nAssembly will continue consideration of agenda item 40,\r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic Ideal”, tomorrow morning as the\r\nthird item.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.15 p.m.\r\n17\r\n"
