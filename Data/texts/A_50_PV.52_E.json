(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 49\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution\r\nof Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of\r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nsecond annual report of the International Tribunal\r\n(A/50/365)\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly takes\r\nnote of the second annual report of the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Antonio Cassese,\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal.\r\nMr. Cassese (President of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991): Since I last had the honour of addressing the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in November 1994, there have been\r\nnumerous positive developments in the work of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\r\nUnhappily, there continue to exist major obstacles in the\r\npath of the Tribunal’s success — obstacles which are only\r\nsurmountable if the world community provides assistance.\r\nThe International Criminal Tribunal now has the\r\ncapacity fully to operate as a judicial body. At present we\r\nare at last in a position to prosecute those responsible for\r\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\r\ncommitted in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991.\r\nWe have come a long way in the two years since\r\nNovember 1993, when the Tribunal was established. At\r\nthat time, the Tribunal consisted only of 11 judges and a\r\nStatute. It had no budget, no seat, no courtroom, no\r\nprison, no staff, no code of criminal procedure. Most\r\ndebilitating of all, for the first nine months of its\r\nexistence the Tribunal had no functioning Prosecutor.\r\nSince that time we have made great strides. As a result,\r\nwe can now proudly state that everything is in place at\r\nthe Tribunal. At long last we are engaged in the\r\nadministration of justice.\r\nIn the two years since November 1993 we have gone\r\nfrom being a lofty — some might have said nebulous —\r\nidea to a living reality. The idea was that Member States\r\ncould unite to ensure that vicious crimes against\r\ninternational humanitarian law would be punished. It was\r\nan idea which was met with scepticism, even with\r\nridicule, by many who believed it to be unattainable. But\r\nit has been attained, at least in part, by dint of patience\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nand perseverance. We Judges felt strongly that it was our\r\nmoral duty to do our utmost to make the Tribunal an\r\neffective judicial mechanism.\r\nI shall briefly recall what I consider to be our major\r\nachievements so far: First, our Prosecutor has issued nine\r\nindictments against 43 individuals, charging them with\r\nserious violations of international humanitarian law. These\r\nindictments have all been confirmed by a reviewing Judge.\r\nArrest warrants have been issued against all the accused.\r\nThese accused include political and military leaders.\r\nSecondly, a number of further investigations are under\r\nway in the Office of the Prosecutor with the result that\r\nmore indictments are being issued almost every month.\r\nThirdly, in pre-trial hearings, significant issues have\r\nbeen raised and argued before a Trial Chamber and the\r\nAppeals Chamber. These issues are of crucial importance;\r\nfor instance, some concern the international legitimacy and\r\nlawfulness of the Tribunal’s establishment by the Security\r\nCouncil. Others relate to the Tribunal’s subject-matter\r\njurisdiction, that is to say, its power to prosecute certain\r\ncrimes. Other issues concern the protection of witnesses.\r\nThe relevant Trial Chamber and the Appeals Chamber have\r\nthus had the opportunity to pronounce upon these important\r\nmatters, thereby breaking new ground in international\r\ncriminal law.\r\nFourthly, the trial of an accused is set to start in a few\r\nmonths now that all the pre-trial motions have been heard.\r\nThe delay in the commencement of the actual trial is due\r\nentirely to problems raised by the defence. Counsel for the\r\ndefence has asked the Tribunal to give him the financial\r\nwherewithal necessary to prepare his case, as well as the\r\ntime necessary to interview witnesses. It is his contention\r\nthat, so far, he has been unable to contact witnesses for the\r\ndefence both because they are in a war zone and because of\r\nthe total — I repeat, total — non-cooperation of the\r\nBosnian Serb authorities in Pale. The Tribunal, of course,\r\nconsiders the rights of the defence and the principle of fair\r\ntrial as sacrosanct. It therefore felt it was appropriate to\r\ngrant this delay.\r\nFifthly, a hearing has been held under rule 61 of the\r\nTribunal’s rules of procedure and evidence. Rule 61\r\nprovides for a special procedure to which resort may be had\r\nwhen the accused is not brought to trial either because he\r\nevades arrest or because the authorities refuse to cooperate\r\nwith our Tribunal. This special procedure, which is by no\r\nmeans a trial in absentia, is designed to avoid giving the\r\naccused the power to thwart or obstruct international justice\r\nby simply failing to appear in court. Under this procedure\r\nwitnesses can be called by the Prosecutor, and they may\r\ntestify in public and have their testimony recorded for\r\nposterity. On the basis of their testimony, the Trial\r\nChamber may conclude that there are reasonable grounds\r\nfor believing that the accused has committed the crimes\r\ncharged in the indictment, and may issue an international\r\narrest warrant.\r\nLast month the Tribunal applied rule 61 for the first\r\ntime. Thirteen witnesses appeared in court to give\r\ntestimony regarding the alleged atrocities at the hands of\r\nthe accused. At the end of the proceedings, the Trial\r\nChamber issued an international arrest warrant against the\r\naccused. Further, the Trial Chamber asked me, as the\r\nTribunal’s President, to advise the Security Council of the\r\nfailure of the Bosnian Serb Administration in Pale to\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal. I did so on 30 October.\r\nIn sum, the Tribunal is boldly travelling towards the\r\naccomplishment of its mission. The path is not, however,\r\nwithout certain obstacles. I shall now outline three of\r\nthem.\r\nFirst, the decisions, orders and requests of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia can be\r\nenforced only by others, namely, national authorities.\r\nUnlike domestic criminal courts, the Tribunal has no\r\nenforcement agencies at its disposal. Without the\r\nintermediary of national authorities, it cannot execute\r\narrest warrants, it cannot seize evidentiary material, it\r\ncannot compel witnesses to give testimony, it cannot\r\nsearch the scenes where crimes have been allegedly\r\ncommitted. For all these purposes, it must turn to State\r\nauthorities and request them to take action. Our Tribunal\r\nis like a giant who has no arms and no legs. To walk and\r\nwork, he needs artificial limbs. These artificial limbs are\r\nthe State authorities. Without their help the Tribunal\r\ncannot operate.\r\nAdmittedly, this holds true for all international\r\ninstitutions, which need the support of States to be able\r\nto operate. However, our Tribunal needs the support of\r\nStates more than any other international institution\r\nbecause its actions have a direct impact on individuals\r\nwho live in the territory of sovereign States and are\r\nsubject to their jurisdiction. The adoption by States of all\r\nthe legislative, administrative and judicial measures\r\nnecessary for the expeditious execution of the Tribunal’s\r\ndecisions is thus of crucial importance.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nUnfortunately, despite a clear decision by the Security\r\nCouncil in resolution 827 (1993), at present only some\r\n15 — I repeat: 15 — of the 185 States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations have enacted implementing legislation. A\r\nfew other States have gone only so far as to indicate their\r\nintention to adopt such legislation in the near future.\r\nThis lack of cooperation proves particularly paralysing\r\nfor our Tribunal when it comes to the execution of arrest\r\nwarrants. As I said, the Tribunal does not have an\r\nenforcement agency of any description at its disposal; we\r\ntherefore need the assistance of States for the execution of\r\narrest warrants issued by the Tribunal. Regrettably, two of\r\nthe entities of the former Yugoslavia have so far refused to\r\ncooperate: I refer to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro) and the Bosnian Serb\r\nAdministration in Pale. Their total lack of cooperation has\r\ngreatly hampered the work of our Tribunal: 41 of the first\r\n43 accused are in their territory, but they have failed to\r\napprehend these suspects and surrender them to our\r\nTribunal. Without having suspects physically in our\r\npresence, we cannot proceed to trial.\r\nA second obstacle facing the Tribunal arises out of the\r\nfact that it is trying cases while an armed conflict is still\r\nunder way and bloodshed and suffering are daily\r\noccurrences. This is in stark contrast to the usual situation\r\nof judicial institutions dealing with crimes committed in the\r\ncourse of hostilities. They step in only when the conflict\r\nhas ceased, as at Nuremberg and Tokyo. In contrast to this,\r\nour Tribunal has been called upon to dispense justice while\r\narmed conflict continues and while the planners and\r\nperpetrators of crimes shelter under the protective umbrella\r\nof military or political power. Plainly, no suspects will be\r\nsurrendered to the Tribunal by those authorities which have\r\nbeen criminally complicit in, or at least criminally negligent\r\nin not preventing or stopping, serious violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nAll of this greatly complicates the task of our\r\nTribunal. For one thing, investigators — whether acting on\r\nbehalf of the Prosecutor or of the Defence — may be\r\nprevented from collecting evidence or interviewing\r\nwitnesses because of continuing armed clashes. For another,\r\nwitnesses may, in the absence of a protective State\r\napparatus, fear immediate reprisals against themselves or\r\ntheir relatives, and therefore may be reluctant to come\r\nforward to testify. Finally, the state of armed conflict may\r\ncreate in many citizens a mood of partisanship. War\r\ncriminals may be hailed as heroes, and cooperation with the\r\nTribunal may be viewed as traitorous.\r\nA third concern is the difficulty the Tribunal has\r\nfaced — and continues to face — in obtaining the\r\nfinancial and practical resources necessary to carry out its\r\nwork. The budget for the 1994-1995 biennium was\r\napproved only in July 1995. Two short months later, the\r\nfinancial crisis in the United Nations created new\r\nproblems. These kinds of financial limitations strike at the\r\nvery heart of our Tribunal, for two main reasons.\r\nFirst, the Tribunal is a new and innovative institution\r\nwhich is in the early stages of its growth, and we are\r\nundertaking activities which have never before been\r\ncarried out by the United Nations. We urgently need to\r\nrecruit a full complement of staff, we need to provide\r\nthem with adequate tools to work, and we need to have\r\nadequate funds available to cover the initial expenses of\r\nsetting up the Tribunal’s working environment.\r\nThere is a second reason why the budget restrictions\r\nhave made our lives particularly difficult in the Tribunal.\r\nThe need to investigate crimes which are being committed\r\nhalf a continent away, and in a constantly changing\r\nenvironment, calls for immediate and responsive action by\r\nour investigators. They must move while the events are\r\nfresh. When mass graves are suddenly available for\r\ninspection, we should not be agonizing over whether the\r\nfunding for travel is available.\r\nAll these undertakings are costly — of that there is\r\nno doubt; but if the United Nations wants to hear the\r\nvoice of justice speak loudly and clearly, then the\r\nMember States must be willing to pay the price.\r\nOne step in the right direction was the recent\r\ndecision by the Secretary-General to give to all the\r\nrelevant departments direct responsibility for\r\nimplementing the cost-saving measures which have been\r\nput into effect. This is indeed welcome news to our\r\nTribunal. At least the responsibility is now in our own\r\nhands to set priorities and spending goals. But this is not\r\nenough. We urge the Assembly to help us fulfil our\r\nmission by providing the badly needed resources.\r\nFor us to overcome the hurdles I have outlined so\r\nfar, the increasing support of Members of the General\r\nAssembly is vital. In this connection, I am happy to\r\nreport that so far a number of States have substantially\r\nassisted our Tribunal politically, morally and financially.\r\nIn particular, the host country, the Netherlands, is\r\nproviding unreserved and continuing assistance, for which\r\nwe are deeply grateful. The European Union should also\r\nbe highly commended for its invaluable support in many\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nareas; without this support our task would have been even\r\nmore daunting.\r\nWe are aware at The Hague that the world is watching\r\nour every move very closely and with mixed feelings:\r\ngenerous expectations but also profound scepticism. We\r\ncannot afford not to fulfil these expectations; we must\r\ndispel this scepticism. The failure of our Tribunal would\r\nmean the failure of the Rwanda Tribunal as well, and the\r\nvery idea of a permanent international criminal court could\r\nbe set back for decades. Even more important, the\r\nTribunal’s failure would mean leaving unfulfilled the hopes\r\nand demands of so many victims in the former Yugoslavia\r\nwho are insistently calling for justice.\r\nIt has been said that the two dominant feelings in our\r\nage are fear and indifference. The Tribunal is a symbol to\r\nshow that the United Nations cannot be accused of\r\nindifference vis-à-vis the fear and suffering prevailing in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Hence, to allow our Tribunal to fade\r\naway or eventually succumb to the obstacles I mentioned\r\nearlier would ultimately mean that the world community\r\nwas impotent in the face of terrible human tragedies such\r\nas that currently unfolding in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nLet me briefly tackle another topical matter, namely\r\nthe possible impact on our Tribunal of successful peace\r\nnegotiations. At present there appears to be a real prospect\r\nfor a lasting peace in the region. Should that day arrive, is\r\nthe Tribunal to become useless? The answer must be a\r\nclear “No”. If anything, the importance of the Tribunal will\r\nbe even greater. If there is to be a lasting peace, it must be\r\naccompanied by a sense of justice in the minds of all the\r\ncitizens of, and in particular the victims of atrocities in, the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. If at the end of a war torturers and their\r\nvictims are treated alike, the war’s legacy of hatred,\r\nresentment and acrimony will not have been snuffed out;\r\nrather, it will continue to smoulder. The existence of peace\r\nin such a climate would be precarious indeed. If, however,\r\nthe Tribunal, as an impartial body, continues its work of\r\nbringing to justice at least some of the most egregious\r\noffenders, those who have suffered through four years of\r\nhellish war will be better able to find the forgiveness\r\nrequired for peace to last.\r\nIndeed, with peace the Tribunal will become more\r\nefficient and better able to accomplish its mission. With\r\npeace, States will no longer be in a position to eschew\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal; they will have to comply\r\nwith the Tribunal’s requests to surrender suspects.\r\nSimilarly, those States in the region which have so far\r\nevinced little interest in helping the Tribunal will now have\r\na real stake in cooperating, in order to ensure their good\r\nstanding at the United Nations.\r\nLet me conclude by stressing once again that, despite\r\nthe myriad difficulties encountered over the past year, the\r\nJudges at The Hague, indeed all those working for the\r\nTribunal, have not been discouraged. Rather, they have\r\nworked unsparingly, bearing in mind the forceful words\r\nuttered 50 years ago this month, on 21 November 1945,\r\nby the United States Chief Prosecutor, Justice Jackson, in\r\nNuremberg, with respect to the trial that was opening\r\nthere. He said:\r\n“This trial represents mankind’s desperate effort to\r\napply the discipline of the law to statesmen who\r\nhave used their powers of State to attack the\r\nfoundations of the world’s peace”.\r\nThe Judges at The Hague feel that these words\r\nshould hold true for the Tribunal as well. They too are\r\nmaking a “desperate effort” to pursue the goal of applying\r\nthe discipline of international humanitarian law to those\r\nwho have planned, directed or perpetrated horrific crimes\r\nin the former Yugoslavia.\r\nI very much hope, now that the Tribunal has moved\r\non to the second, operational stage of its development,\r\nthat it will be able to bring to fruition its immense\r\npotential and thus show that international criminal justice\r\ncan fulfil an indispensable role in the pacification of the\r\nworld community.\r\nMr. Biegman (Netherlands): I am speaking as a\r\nrepresentative of a country that has wholeheartedly\r\nsupported the decision of the Security Council to establish\r\nan ad hoc tribunal for the prosecution of persons\r\nresponsible for serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law committed in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia since 1991. I am also the representative of the\r\ncountry where the seat of that Tribunal has been\r\nestablished.\r\nWhy did the Netherlands Government support that\r\ndecision of the Security Council and why did my\r\nGovernment welcome the Tribunal to The Hague?\r\nBecause, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nKingdom said in his statement at the forty-ninth session\r\nof the General Assembly, it is of the utmost importance\r\nnot only that the terrible crimes committed in the territory\r\nof the former Yugoslavia be condemned by the\r\ninternational community, but also that those responsible\r\nfor those crimes, as well as the actual perpetrators, be\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nprosecuted — as a matter of justice, and also as a matter of\r\ndeterrence.\r\nImpunity encourages future crimes against humanity.\r\nImpunity often follows from the unwillingness or inability\r\nof the State whose duty it would be to prosecute to do so.\r\nThe Netherlands Government therefore sees the decision of\r\nthe Security Council to establish the Tribunal, an impartial\r\ncourt that can take on that task and thereby try to put an\r\nend to impunity, as a necessary complement to the existing\r\njudicial system and as a milestone in the history of\r\ninternational criminal jurisdiction. For the first time since\r\nNuremberg and Tokyo, the international community is\r\nholding individuals responsible for their actions during\r\nwartime and in situations of war. In the miserable history\r\nof the former Yugoslavia, this is one of the very few\r\npositive outcomes so far.\r\nThe President of the Tribunal, in his second report,\r\nrightly states that the Tribunal has started to meet the hopes\r\nand expectations of the victims in the former Yugoslavia\r\nand that the preparatory work has been completed and trial\r\nactivity has begun, bringing the Tribunal closer to realizing\r\nits principal objectives as laid down in Security Council\r\nresolution 808 (1993).\r\nThe Netherlands Government would consider it a\r\nserious setback if this process were, for whatever reason,\r\nslowed down or jeopardized. It would be sad indeed if the\r\nTribunal, for political or financial reasons, or through lack\r\nof cooperation, could not fulfil its task of applying the basic\r\nprinciples of humanitarian law. Such a situation would,\r\nmoreover, have serious repercussions for the development\r\nof international law, for the authority of the Security\r\nCouncil, for the credibility of the quest for justice by the\r\ninternational community and for the efforts currently being\r\nundertaken to create a permanent international criminal\r\ncourt — a court which, in the opinion of our Government,\r\nshould be the ultimate goal.\r\nThe Netherlands has always wholeheartedly supported\r\nthe work of the Yugoslavia Tribunal. Its Government\r\nplayed an active role in the identification and acquisition of\r\nsuitable premises for the Tribunal. It took care of\r\nconverting an office building into an appropriate court\r\nbuilding, and it put this at the disposal of the Tribunal, free\r\nof rent for the first year. The Netherlands Government also\r\nassumed the task of protecting those premises, as well as\r\nthe Tribunal’s personnel.\r\nNetherlands experts support the investigation\r\nprocedures free of charge, and recently the Government\r\nmade $2 million available to the Tribunal to clear a\r\nbacklog of documents and information material, which\r\nthreatened to choke the administration of the Tribunal\r\nand, thereby, the progress of its work.\r\nIt will thus be clear that the proper functioning of\r\nthe Tribunal is a matter on which the Netherlands bestows\r\ngreat care, because so much depends on it.\r\nIf the Tribunal is to be effective, it will need\r\nsufficient financial resources, as well as the cooperation\r\nof all States through the provision of all available\r\ninformation and the extradition of indicted suspects.\r\nThe Tribunal has made a good and solid start. It has\r\nbegun its first proceedings — against Mr. Tadić. It\r\ndeclared itself competent to try this case, but deferred the\r\nactual trial, to allow the defence more time for proper\r\npreparation of its case. The Prosecutor is preparing\r\nindictments against other suspects, building on the\r\nexperience gathered in the Tadić case. Formal\r\ninvestigations against Mr. Karadzic, General Mladic and\r\nothers have started.\r\nThe Netherlands Government firmly believes that the\r\nTribunal will be a success. With time, this success will\r\nmake potential war criminals think twice before engaging\r\nin violations of humanitarian law. Just as important, it\r\nmay break the cycle of revenge between peoples by\r\nputting the blame on individuals who were the main\r\ninstigators and executors, and may thus provide a basis\r\nfor lasting peace.\r\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal, in our opinion,\r\ndeserves the unreserved support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Kocetkov (Bosnia and Herzegovina): The\r\nauthorities and the people of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, as well as the democratic public in the\r\nworld, accepted and hailed the decision to establish the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991, as an expression of the\r\ninternational community’s determination to bring before\r\nthe court of justice all those who took part in the\r\npreparation or execution of the policy of genocide and\r\naggression against the sovereign countries and peoples in\r\nthe territory of the former Yugoslavia.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nThose responsible for implementing the policies of\r\nnationalism and chauvinism must be held accountable and\r\nanswerable for crimes not seen in Europe since the end of\r\nthe Second World War. At the same time, they must cease\r\nengaging in pogroms, rapes, massacres, forced movements\r\nof civilian populations and the extinction of whole peoples.\r\nThe issue here is that of the most serious violations of\r\nhuman rights — rights established in the United Nations\r\nCharter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nGeneva and numerous other international Conventions.\r\nThe Tribunal’s function is not just to give satisfaction\r\nto the victims of the crimes; it is also to deter potential\r\nfuture criminals. More than 200,000 people — most of\r\nthem innocent civilians: women and children, and\r\npredominantly Bosniak Muslims — have been killed in the\r\nterritory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina alone.\r\nThousands of people, mostly draft-age men and young\r\nboys, have disappeared. About 2 million people — almost\r\nhalf the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina — have\r\nbeen expelled from their homes. Thousands of women have\r\nbeen systematically raped, with the most monstrous of\r\nmotives.\r\nThese are all components of a strategy and of tactics\r\naimed at achieving goals of national Fascist policy and\r\naggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nBesides, the aggressor, as well as terrorist gangs formed\r\nand supported by the aggressor, has systematically\r\ndestroyed an entire non-Serbian heritage of history and\r\ncivilization. Mosques and churches have been levelled, and\r\nMuslim cemeteries have been ploughed.\r\nRight up to the present, what we have witnessed being\r\ncarried out is a policy of destroying the signs of every\r\ncivilization that does not accord with the aggressors’\r\nnational or religious characteristics, in the territories they\r\nare temporarily occupying. These territories are temporarily\r\noccupied by paramilitary forces under the Pale national\r\nFascist leadership of Karadzic and Mladic, both of whom,\r\nas the most prominent war criminals, have been indicted by\r\nthe International Tribunal. Both are indeed war criminals,\r\nand their names must not be forgotten.\r\nWe consider that the work of the Prosecutor has been\r\neffective so far, and we expect the work of the Trial\r\nChambers, too, to be effective.\r\nThe tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand of Rwanda has been referred to frequently during\r\ndebates in this General Assembly session, in the context of\r\nthe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations — and rightly so.\r\nMany of these facts are well known, but, in the\r\nname of truth and justice, what has happened should be\r\nmade obvious to everyone. In this respect, we support and\r\nwelcome the International Tribunal’s report. We welcome\r\nwith great pleasure the comment, in the report, that the\r\nInternational Tribunal\r\n“is now substantially closer to realizing its principal\r\nobjectives as laid down in Security Council\r\nresolutions 808 (1993) and 827 (1993).” (A/50/365,\r\npara. 1)\r\nThe issue here is not revenge. The issue here is\r\njustice — justice in respect of all crimes committed;\r\njustice for the hundreds of thousands of people who have\r\nbeen subjected to unprecedented suffering; justice for the\r\nmurdered and maimed children; justice for the thousands\r\nof raped women; justice for the destroyed cities and\r\nvillages; justice for the separated families; justice for the\r\npeople in besieged cities who have daily suffered torture\r\nfor more than three years, being subjected to shelling and\r\nsniping, being deliberately and permanently deprived of\r\nelectricity, water, medicine, food and the right to move\r\nabout, and being prevented from undertaking the\r\nnecessary medical evacuation of the sick and wounded.\r\nThese are the cases of Sarajevo, Gorazde, Bihac,\r\nTuzla, Srebrenica, Zepa — cities which have been\r\ndesignated “safe areas” by the United Nations. There are\r\nalso many other cities and villages in this situation. The\r\nsuffering of those people must not be forgotten — for the\r\nsake of our children, for the sake of the future generations\r\nthat should be able to live in peace and freedom and\r\nenjoy the basic human rights and freedoms to which the\r\nUnited Nations is solemnly committed.\r\nThose are all reasons to request from everyone here,\r\nand in good faith to expect, as has so far been the case,\r\nfull support for the International Tribunal. With this in\r\nmind, we point out that it is necessary to ensure the full\r\nsupport of all United Nations Member States for the work\r\nof the International Tribunal. This, above all, presumes,\r\nin accordance with the provisions of the statute of the\r\nTribunal, the handing over of all of those persons indicted\r\nby the Tribunal for crimes committed. This also presumes\r\nall the other support necessary for the Tribunal to carry\r\nout its functions effectively — including financial,\r\ntechnical and procedural support, as well as an increased\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nnumber of judges, that is, an increased number of Trial\r\nChambers.\r\nThe experience of the Tribunal’s work and the\r\nconcrete results of that experience are of crucial importance\r\nfor deciding on the establishment of an international\r\ncriminal court, which we support.\r\nGiving full credit, full confidence and support to the\r\nProsecutor, the Honourable Justice Goldstone, for his\r\npresent work and everything he has done so far, we also\r\nrequest and expect that all criminals be indicted as soon as\r\npossible, if there is a legal basis for this and if all the\r\nnecessary evidence has been gathered. We especially\r\nemphasize that the Tribunal must not allow legal\r\nproceedings against only the “small fish” to hide the most\r\nimportant instigators, planners, organizers and executors of\r\nthe terrible crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. Because of the global dimensions and the\r\ncharacter of the crimes committed in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and in other parts of the former Yugoslavia,\r\nthe International Tribunal must gain our special support and\r\nhave a special place, in the interest of the general principles\r\nof human justice.\r\nIn this respect, we insist that Radovan Karadzić, Ratko\r\nMladić and all others who must answer for the terrible\r\nhuman tragedy inflicted upon millions of people in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and in other parts of the former\r\nYugoslavia must be brought before the International\r\nTribunal.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): Speaking on the report of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991, I should like, first of all, to\r\nthank the President of the Tribunal, Judge Antonio Cassese,\r\nfor his clear, comprehensive and thoughtful statement. Both\r\nthat statement and the report show the many positive\r\ndevelopments in the Tribunal’s work, as well as the main\r\ndifficulties in fulfilling the mandate entrusted to it by the\r\nUnited Nations. Italy is particularly pleased with the\r\nTribunal’s achievements, and is fully committed to helping\r\novercome the remaining obstacles in its path.\r\nSince its establishment in 1993, the Tribunal has come\r\na long way towards setting up an effective judicial\r\nmechanism for the prosecution and punishment of crimes\r\nagainst international humanitarian law committed in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Despite enormous problems, a number\r\nof important results have been achieved — thanks\r\nespecially to the skill and dedication of the judges, the\r\nProsecutor’s office, and those non-governmental\r\norganizations that joined in the effort.\r\nThe Tribunal has now become fully operational. The\r\nProsecutor has handed down indictments, all of which\r\nhave been confirmed by the reviewing judges. Arrest\r\nwarrants have been issued. Those warrants against\r\npolitical or military leaders, although not yet executed,\r\nhave resulted in the exclusion of such persons from the\r\nnegotiating table. Furthermore, hearings have been held\r\nbefore both the Trial Chambers and the Appeals\r\nChambers. In one of those proceedings, 13 witnesses were\r\nheard in court. This activity was also made possible by\r\nthe creation of all the necessary judicial infrastructures —\r\nanother area where the Tribunal had to start from scratch.\r\nOther major problems, as we have heard, still lie\r\nahead. In order for the Tribunal to meet the expectations\r\nof the world community, the full cooperation of Member\r\nStates is of crucial importance. States must cooperate by\r\nadopting national legislation to implement the statute of\r\nthe Tribunal. Without such legislation, search and arrest\r\nwarrants cannot be executed, nor can subpoenas be\r\ncarried out. Adequate financial support for the Tribunal is\r\nalso imperative. I am glad to say that Italy was the first\r\ncountry to adopt implementing legislation, and Italy has\r\nalso made a sizeable financial contribution to the\r\nTribunal’s Trust Fund.\r\nWe very much hope that the current peace\r\nnegotiations on the former Yugoslavia will strengthen the\r\nTribunal’s role, rather than jeopardizing it. The peace\r\nsettlement should include clauses making it incumbent\r\nupon all the parties concerned to cooperate fully with the\r\nTribunal. Peace and justice must go hand in hand.\r\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize another reason why\r\nthe Tribunal must succeed. The International Tribunal for\r\nthe former Yugoslavia and the one on Rwanda are a sort\r\nof laboratory in the area of international criminal justice.\r\nThey may prove to be of tremendous importance for the\r\nfuture establishment of a permanent criminal court. Italy\r\nhas consistently advocated the creation of a permanent\r\ncourt, and has recently renewed its offer to host the\r\ndiplomatic conference to adopt the relevant statute. We\r\ntherefore cannot but fully support the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, not only to\r\nbring to justice the perpetrators of atrocious crimes\r\nagainst humanity, but also, allow me to repeat, as a\r\nmilestone on the road to establishing a permanent\r\ninternational criminal court.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran): Allow\r\nme at the outset to extend my appreciation to Mr. Antonio\r\nCassese, the President of the International Tribunal, for\r\nsubmitting the second annual report of the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since\r\n1991.\r\nPeace in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\ncannot be fully restored, and then trusted, unless those\r\ncriminal elements who have organized and perpetrated the\r\nmost horrible and deplorable atrocities in that region are\r\nbrought to justice. The conscience of the whole world has\r\nbeen wounded by the practice of “ethnic cleansing” and by\r\nthe grave violations of the laws or customs applicable in\r\narmed conflict, as well by the inhumane treatment directed\r\nagainst Bosnian Muslims by the Serbs, including genocide,\r\nthe massive rape of women, torture and the forcible\r\ndisplacement of civilians. These crimes eventually\r\npersuaded the international community to urgently establish\r\nan ad hoc tribunal to prosecute and punish the perpetrators.\r\nThis means that those criminal acts, which are beyond any\r\nexplanation, are not to be condoned.\r\nThe gravity and seriousness of the crimes and\r\nbreaches of international humanitarian law committed by\r\nthe Serbs made it imperative that the International Tribunal,\r\nas an exceptional and unique case, be set up beyond the\r\ntraditional approach of international law requiring the\r\nestablishment of such a body by treaty. The unique\r\ncharacter of the Tribunal, and indeed the hope expressed in\r\nthe seventh preambular paragraph of Security Council\r\nresolution 827 (1993) that the Tribunal would\r\n“contribute to ensuring that such violations are halted\r\nand effectively redressed”,\r\ngave rise to high expectations for immediate action,\r\nirrespective of the fact that such judicial institutions\r\nnormally come after the event, when the hostilities have\r\ncome to an end.\r\nWith the removal of some obstacles that had impeded\r\nthe functioning of the Tribunal at the initial stage,\r\nresponsibility now rests upon this legal body to intensify its\r\nendeavours to achieve the objectives set out in the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nThe Serbian atrocities against the Muslim people of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina have in no way\r\nceased. Recent reports have revealed that the Bosnian\r\nMuslims, in places such as Srebrenica, Zepa and Banja\r\nLuka, have been subjected to extremely harsh treatment,\r\nsuch as “ethnic cleansing”, massacre and massive torture.\r\nHad the perpetrators of those grave crimes previously\r\nfaced serious political and legal reactions, the world\r\nwould not have witnessed such tragic events. The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran condemns all those crimes, and urges the\r\nTribunal to take the most vigorous action against those\r\nresponsible.\r\nThe International Tribunal, which has the support of\r\nthe international community, should ensure that under no\r\ncircumstances is the imperative of justice ignored. To this\r\nend, the indictment and punishment of those criminals is\r\nof the utmost urgency. In this context, peace negotiations\r\nwith the very individuals who have been indicted by the\r\nTribunal should be avoided under any circumstances.\r\nThe Tribunal should fulfil its task effectively and\r\nexpeditiously regardless of political expediencies. It is of\r\ngreat satisfaction that the second report of the Tribunal\r\nstates that\r\n“Whatever the political consequences or the eventual\r\noutcome of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nthe Tribunal will not flinch from this task.”\r\n(A/50/365, para. 5)\r\nFurthermore, the proper functioning of the Tribunal\r\ncan heal the wounds resulting from war crimes in the\r\nBalkans. This can create trust, confidence and hope for\r\nthe future, all of which are vital for the realization of\r\nlasting peace and tranquillity in the region.\r\nFor the Tribunal to be successful and effective, the\r\ncooperation of all States is undoubtedly necessary and\r\ncrucial. It provides an appropriate solution to the\r\nproblems referred to in paragraph 191 of the report under\r\nconsideration. An important indication of such\r\ncooperation could be the pledge of all States not to\r\nharbour war criminals. In our view, the United Nations,\r\nthrough its various bodies, can adopt certain measures to\r\nensure such cooperation.\r\nDespite the remaining problems still hampering the\r\nsatisfactory functioning of the Tribunal, it is indeed a\r\npositive development that some individuals have been\r\nindicted for their criminal offences. Further steps should\r\nbe taken to punish them, as well as to bring all other\r\nviolators to justice. We share the view expressed in the\r\nreport that the Tribunal has a historical role in setting\r\nprecedents for future international criminal forums. As\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nenvisaged in the report, the Tribunal, if it acts in a just and\r\neffective manner, will\r\n“send a message to the victims of appalling crimes\r\nthat humanity will not turn its back on them.”\r\n(A/50/365, para. 199)\r\nIn conclusion, the Islamic Republic of Iran, on its part,\r\nstands ready to cooperate fully with the Tribunal in\r\nfulfilling its task.\r\nMr. Gnehm (United States of America): The\r\nPresident of the Tribunal, Mr. Antonio Cassese, has\r\nhonoured this body today with a thorough introduction of\r\nthe report of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. President Cassese and the other\r\nTribunal judges are performing, and performing extremely\r\nwell, a difficult and challenging task. They have had to\r\ndevelop procedures for operating in an environment where\r\nthoroughness and fairness are absolutely essential and\r\nprecedents are inexact and few. Their daily efforts serve to\r\nbolster international law and the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter. They have earned our respect, and they\r\ndeserve our support.\r\nPresident Cassese’s presence and his statement here\r\ntoday reflect the critical role that the General Assembly\r\ncontinues to play in connection with the war-crimes\r\nTribunals. The Assembly’s condemnation of the crimes\r\nagainst humanity that have been committed in Rwanda and\r\nthe former Yugoslavia illustrates the universal nature of the\r\noutrage over those atrocities. It is here in this Assembly\r\nthat funding for the Tribunals is decided, and it will be the\r\nlevel of financial and political support received from\r\nmembers of this Assembly that will play a major role in\r\ndetermining whether the Tribunals achieve their full\r\npotential.\r\nThe success of the Tribunal in achieving its purpose\r\nis a matter of concern to the United States Government at\r\nthe highest levels. In a recent statement given in connection\r\nwith the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the\r\nNuremburg trials, President Clinton reaffirmed America’s\r\nstrong support for the Tribunals and for their goals. The\r\nAmerican people want to see those responsible for\r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity brought\r\nto justice. We want to deter such crimes, and we want to\r\nhelp nations torn apart by violence to begin a process of\r\nhealing and reconciliation.\r\nIn the President’s words, the\r\n“indictments are not negotiable. Those accused ...\r\nmust be tried, and, if found guilty, they must be held\r\naccountable. Some people are concerned that\r\npursuing peace in Bosnia and prosecuting war\r\ncriminals are incompatible goals. But I believe they\r\nare wrong. There must be peace for justice to\r\nprevail, and there must be justice when peace\r\nprevails.”\r\nIn those same remarks, President Clinton said that\r\n“nations all around the world that value freedom and\r\ntolerance [should] establish a permanent international\r\ncourt to prosecute, with the support of the United\r\nNations Security Council, serious violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.”\r\nSuch a permanent court would, again in the President’s\r\nwords, serve as a\r\n“tribute to the people who did such important work\r\nin Nuremburg”,\r\nand it would build on the experience garnered during the\r\ndeliberations of the current United Nations Tribunals.\r\nIn his statement today, President Cassese identifies\r\na number of issues facing the International Tribunal for\r\nthe former Yugoslavia. One involves the need for\r\ncooperation by key Member States.\r\nIn this connection, my Government has recently been\r\nin contact with President Milosevic of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and elicited from him a firm commitment to\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal in its work, whether or not\r\narmed conflict continues. We expect these encouraging\r\nwords to be matched by deeds.\r\nSimilar assurances have not been forthcoming from\r\nthe Bosnian Serb Administration in Pale. Member States\r\nshould demand of Pale what the statute of the Tribunal\r\ndemands: full cooperation. In the current peace talks my\r\nGovernment is emphasizing the importance we attach to\r\nall parties’ cooperation with the Tribunal in all aspects of\r\nits work.\r\nPresident Cassese also spoke of the need for\r\nadequate resources. Accordingly, we applaud the financial\r\nand other support given by many Governments and by the\r\nEuropean Union. We are grateful for the voluntary\r\ncontributions made by several Governments and the\r\nefforts of non-governmental organizations to support the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nwork of the Tribunals. But these efforts must be continued,\r\nsustained and enlarged. The Tribunals deserve the broadest\r\npossible support.\r\nFor its part, my Government assures the Tribunals of\r\nits backing, which to date has been considerable. In\r\naddition to the 1994-95 regular budget assessment of $5.5\r\nmillion that we have paid for the Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia, the United States has made a voluntary\r\ncontribution of $3 million, in addition to providing more\r\nthan 20 prosecutors, investigators and other experts, as well\r\nas various supplies and items of equipment at our own\r\nexpense. Our total commitment to date of about $13.5\r\nmillion is a beginning, and we encourage other Member\r\nStates to join us in pledging sufficient funds for the\r\nTribunal to meet its responsibilities.\r\nWe applaud recent actions by the United Nations\r\nSecretariat increasing the flexibility of its support for the\r\nTribunal, including the transfer of some fiscal authority to\r\nthe Tribunal.\r\nMr. Pibulsonggram (Thailand), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nAs President Cassese’s statement today attests, the ad\r\nhoc Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are\r\nnew and important ventures. My Government strongly\r\nsupports them and urges others to do the same. The success\r\nof the tribunals will have an important impact not only on\r\nthe conflicts to which they specifically relate, but on future\r\nefforts to address violations of international humanitarian\r\nlaw. We must continue our efforts to find effective ways to\r\ninvestigate and prosecute war criminals. We must heed the\r\nlessons of Nuremburg. In so doing, and only in so doing,\r\nwill we fulfil the responsibilities of our own time.\r\nMr. Yoogalingam (Malaysia): At the outset, allow me\r\non behalf of my delegation to express our appreciation to\r\nthe President of the International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia, Mr. Antonio Cassese, for the very\r\ncomprehensive second annual report of the Tribunal\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly, as contained in document\r\nA/50/365. My delegation would also like to express our\r\ndeep appreciation to the Government of the Netherlands for\r\nits cooperation and the support given to the Tribunal since\r\nits establishment.\r\nHaving carefully studied the report, my delegation\r\nwould like to make the following points. First, my\r\ndelegation is concerned over the financial difficulties still\r\nconfronting the Tribunal, particularly after more than two\r\nyears of its existence. While recognizing that some\r\naspects of this problem were addressed by the General\r\nAssembly this summer, the important work of this\r\nTribunal should not be allowed to grind to a halt as a\r\nresult of budgetary constraints. We need to undertake\r\nspecific measures to ensure secure and stable financing\r\nfor the Tribunal to fulfil its role fully and effectively. We\r\nhope that the international community will be more\r\nforthcoming in its contributions to finance the activities of\r\nthe Tribunal in order to ensure that justice is done in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. To date, 17 countries have made\r\nvoluntary contributions, including Malaysia, which has\r\ncontributed $2 million.\r\nSecondly, we are also concerned about the drastic\r\nfinancial measures recently imposed by the Office of the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General, Department of Administration\r\nand Management, on the Tribunal. In this regard, we\r\nsupport the resolution unanimously adopted by the\r\nTribunal at its eighth plenary session on 6 October 1995.\r\nWe share its view that\r\n“it would be contrary to the interests of justice to\r\nhamper its activities in the manner sought by the\r\nOffice of the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nAdministration and Management by restricting travel\r\nand recruitment.”\r\nWe also share the view that simply curtailing the\r\nactivities of the Tribunal and awaiting an improvement in\r\nthe financial situation of the United Nations is not the\r\nbest option. In this regard, we urge the Secretary-General\r\nto reconsider his decision.\r\nThirdly, we are pleased to note that some actions\r\nhave been taken by the Tribunal to prosecute war\r\ncriminals. We note that on 24 July 1995 the Prosecutor\r\nsubmitted an indictment against Dr. Karadzić and General\r\nMladić, the two Bosnian Serb leaders charged, either on\r\nthe basis of superior authority or direct responsibility,\r\nwith genocide, crimes against humanity, violations of the\r\nlaws or customs of war and grave breaches of the Geneva\r\nConventions of 1949.\r\nFourthly, we share the observation contained in\r\nparagraph 191 of the report which underlines the\r\nnecessity for Member States to cooperate with the\r\nTribunal to bring criminals to justice, considering that the\r\nTribunal has\r\n“no enforcement agencies at its disposal”.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nAt the same time, we also wish to acknowledge as well as\r\nunderline the important role of non-governmental\r\norganizations in assisting the work of the Tribunal.\r\nWe hope that justice will be served, as we firmly\r\nbelieve that criminals cannot go unpunished nor the victims\r\nbe denied justice. As the adage goes, “justice must not only\r\nbe done, it must be seen to be done”, to atone for the\r\nthousands killed, raped, brutalized and maimed in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Let me conclude by saying that the\r\ncredibility and effectiveness of the Tribunal will be judged\r\nby its action, and for this we need the political commitment\r\nand the financial support of all.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey): We are happy to see positive\r\ndevelopments in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The\r\nadoption of the agreed basic principles of Geneva and New\r\nYork, and the ongoing peace talks in Dayton, foster our\r\noptimism. However, we are aware of the fact that there\r\nmay be stumbling blocks and set-backs on the long and\r\ndifficult road to a just and viable peace. For this reason, we\r\nmust never lose sight of the fact that the long-awaited\r\nresponse to the aggressor has opened the current window of\r\nopportunity to bring an end to the aggression and genocide\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. The recently created\r\nmomentum for a genuine peace could only be maintained\r\nwith this awareness. In this context, the work of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\nis extremely important.\r\nWe have studied very carefully the second annual\r\nreport of the International Criminal Tribunal which is\r\ncontained in document A/50/365. We have also listened\r\nwith great interest to the thought-provoking statement of the\r\nPresident of the Tribunal, Mr. Antonio Cassese. As he\r\nstated:\r\n“Regrettably, two of the entities of the former\r\nYugoslavia have so far refused to cooperate: I refer to\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\r\nMontenegro) and the Bosnian Serb Administration in\r\nPale”. (supra, p. 3)\r\nWe have noted with grave concern his observation that\r\nthe total lack of cooperation of these two “entities” has\r\nbeen greatly hampering the work of the Tribunal. We call\r\non the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to start its\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal without further delay.\r\nWe fully agree with the chief Prosecutor’s statement\r\nthat\r\n“where we find evidence that the political and\r\nmilitary leadership knew or had reason to know of\r\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\r\nand failed to take actions to prevent these violations\r\nor to punish those who committed them, we also\r\nwill seek those leaders accountable.”\r\nThe chief Prosecutor has so far issued nine indictments\r\ncharging individuals, including the political and military\r\nleaders responsible for the grave violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. These indictments are\r\ncrucial steps for a successful prosecution process.\r\nWe attach utmost importance to the admonition of\r\nMr. Cassese that peace without justice is no peace at all.\r\nWe fully endorse his remarks:\r\n“If there is to be a lasting peace, it must be\r\naccompanied by a sense of justice in the minds of\r\nall the citizens of, and in particular the victims of\r\natrocities in, the former Yugoslavia. If at the end of\r\na war torturers and their victims are treated alike,\r\nthe war’s legacy of hatred, resentment and acrimony\r\nwill not have been snuffed out; rather, it will\r\ncontinue to smoulder. The existence of peace in such\r\na climate would be precarious indeed.” (supra, p. 4)\r\nIndeed, if peace is to triumph, justice must prevail.\r\nAnd only then can a climate be created where the people\r\ncan live and work together free from fear. The\r\nresponsibility falls on us. Criminals cannot go unpunished\r\nnor the victims denied justice. We will continue to\r\nsupport the International Criminal Tribunal in discharging\r\nits historic task.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. May I take it that it is\r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 49?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nAgenda item 162\r\nUniversal Congress on the Panama Canal\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.13)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nPanama to introduce draft resolution A/50/L.13.\r\nMr. Illueca (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nFor many reasons related to the history of Panama, from\r\nthe time of its discovery by Spain until our day, it is a\r\nspecial honour for me to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.13, “Universal Congress on the Panama Canal”,\r\nwhich my delegation has submitted to this fiftieth session\r\nof the General Assembly together with the representatives\r\nof France and the United States.\r\nThe reasons for this joint submission were explained\r\nat the meeting of the General Committee on 20 September\r\nlast, when the inclusion of the item on the agenda was\r\nrequested. At that time, we referred to the Panamanian\r\nGovernment’s wish to obtain United Nations support for\r\nthis initiative linked to the future of the Panama Canal and\r\nits role in the twenty-first century.\r\nWith that intention in mind, we appointed Mr.\r\nFernando Manfredo, the High Commissioner of the\r\nRepublic of Panama for the Universal Congress on the\r\nPanama Canal, to be a member of our delegation. For a\r\nnumber of years he was Deputy Administrator and then\r\nAdministrator of this interoceanic waterway.\r\nWith the Assembly’s permission, I would venture to\r\nsuggest that the draft resolution contains the necessary\r\nelements to highlight the convergences between the\r\ncompetence of the United Nations and the implications of\r\nthe Congress in some areas of that competence.\r\nReference is also made in the draft to facts and dates\r\nwhich mark the process that will culminate in 1999 with\r\nPanama’s exercise of full sovereignty over all its territory\r\nand assumption of total responsibility for the control and\r\nfunctioning of the Panama Canal, for which we enjoy the\r\nsupport of brotherly countries of the Americas and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nWe should also like to draw attention to the very\r\npertinent reference to 1998 as International Year of the\r\nOcean and to the World Exposition to take place in Lisbon\r\nby decision of the Government of Portugal.\r\nThe draft resolution, which we are asking the\r\nAssembly to adopt by consensus, will help to make the\r\nUniversal Congress on the Panama Canal a part of the\r\nrich experience of the United Nations with regard to\r\ninternational and multidisciplinary meetings as a form of\r\nworld diplomacy and a way of promoting brotherhood\r\namong men through knowledge.\r\nBeginning in December 1999, Panama will be\r\nassuming a responsibility which we firmly intend to\r\nhonour. By preparing and holding the Universal Congress,\r\nwe shall be sending a powerful signal to the world on\r\nhow international cooperation, taking into account the\r\ninterests and expectations of many countries, disciplines\r\nand activities, can work to define and assure the role that\r\nthe Panama Canal will play in the twenty-first century in\r\nproblems and preoccupations that are part of the subject-\r\nmatter of the United Nations: the law of the sea,\r\ninternational trade, the environment, and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn addition, with the holding of the Universal\r\nCongress, my Government hopes to bring the scientific,\r\ntechnological and cultural life of the Isthmus of Panama\r\ninto harmony with that of the advanced centres of the\r\nworld.\r\nFor many reasons related to the history of my\r\ncountry, and having to do with my own record as a\r\nchampion of Panama’s sovereignty over the whole of our\r\nnational territory, I feel that at this time I am representing\r\nan age-old aspiration of all the men and women of\r\nPanama. Unquestionably it will be a source of deep\r\nsatisfaction to bring the twentieth century to a close with\r\nan act which will again bear witness to the entire world\r\nof the continuing universalist vocation of the people of\r\nPanama.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Bolivia, who will speak on behalf of the\r\nLatin American and the Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Camacho Omiste (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): As Chairman of the Regional Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States for the month of\r\nNovember 1995, it is my honour to speak on agenda item\r\n162 entitled “Universal Congress on the Panama Canal”.\r\nFor many years, Latin American and Caribbean\r\ncountries have followed with common interest items\r\nrelating to the Panama Canal and the negotiations which\r\nled to the signing of the treaties known as the “Torrijos-\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nCarter Treaties” on 7 September 1977. On that historic\r\noccasion, the Heads of State, Heads of Government and\r\nrepresentatives of the American Republics witnessed the\r\nsigning of the Treaties, and on the same date they signed\r\nthe Washington Declaration recognizing:\r\n“the importance for the hemisphere, for trade and for\r\nworld shipping of agreements designed to ensure the\r\naccessibility and continued neutrality of the Panama\r\nCanal”.\r\nPanama is a centre of universal significance, a\r\nkeystone in relations between the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres on the American continent and for interoceanic\r\ncommunication for all peoples. Some of Europe’s influence\r\nin the sixteenth century had reached broad swathes of South\r\nAmerica, and Panama became a required passage for a\r\nsignificant proportion of world trade. Consequently, it was\r\nalso a meeting-point of economic and political interests\r\nwith global influence. These geographical and historical\r\nrealities lend extreme significance to events in this special\r\nregion. How can we be indifferent to the problems, hopes\r\nand achievements of our fellow peoples that live in our part\r\nof the world?\r\nIn the conviction that the Universal Congress on the\r\nPanama Canal will promote understanding and stability, and\r\nalso the development and international cooperation that will\r\nmake possible the orderly and sustainable use of the\r\nresources of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the\r\ndelegations of the Latin American and Caribbean countries\r\nwish through me to express their support for draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.13, and to request that it be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Marrero (United States of America): As a co-\r\nsponsor of the draft resolution before the Assembly, the\r\nUnited States Government believes firmly that Panama’s\r\nUniversal Congress on the Panama Canal is of major\r\nimportance, not only for Panama but for world commerce.\r\nThe United States and Panama are working closely together\r\nto ensure that the transfer of the Canal to Panama on 31\r\nDecember 1999 will be smooth. During the official working\r\nvisit to Washington by President Pérez Balladares, President\r\nClinton pledged full cooperation to place the Canal under\r\nPanamanian control on schedule.\r\nThe United States is confident that Panama will be\r\nready to assume control over the Canal by the end of the\r\ncentury. Even now, Panamanian employees are fulfilling the\r\nvast majority of tasks associated with the Canal’s operation.\r\nThe Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, which\r\nPanama plans to host in 1997, offers a unique opportunity\r\nfor the world community to get a first-hand look at Canal\r\noperations and the preparations for a seamless transfer of\r\nresponsibility.\r\nWe ask all Member States to join us in strongly\r\nsupporting Panama’s initiative in hosting the Universal\r\nCongress on the Panama Canal, and to assist it in this\r\nimportant undertaking.\r\nMr. Gaussot (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nIn 1879, the Société de géographie de Paris convened an\r\ninternational congress, under the chairmanship of\r\nFerdinand de Lesseps, to study the question of an\r\ninteroceanic canal. The congress decided, in a resolution,\r\nto build a canal along a line that would link the Gulf of\r\nLimón, on the Atlantic, and the Bay of Panama, on the\r\nPacific. And so the Panama Canal was born.\r\nThe Government of Panama has taken the initiative\r\nof convening a new Universal Congress, to be held in\r\n1997 — in other words, 118 years after the Paris\r\ncongress. The objective of this international meeting will\r\nbe to contribute to ensuring the effective use of the canal,\r\nintegrated into an open multilateral trading system, under\r\na dynamic administration capable of overcoming the\r\nproblems of development in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe purpose of the resolution before the Assembly\r\nis to support the Panamanian Government’s initiative.\r\nFrance is happy to see that the Panama Canal, which\r\nhas a special place in our national history, will thus enjoy\r\nlasting development and that the authorities that will take\r\nover management in under four years are concerned with\r\nensuring that the Canal fits smoothly into the international\r\neconomy. For those reasons, France decided to co-sponsor\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nWe are certain that the choices made by the\r\nGovernment of Panama are in keeping with the universal\r\nobjective that motivated Ferdinand de Lesseps when, over\r\na century ago, he set about building the Canal, and we are\r\ncertain also that the durability of that spirit of universality\r\nwill contribute to the maintenance and development of the\r\nexcellent relations that already exist between France and\r\nPanama.\r\nMr. Manfredo (Panama) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is a great honour for me to speak before the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as representative of my country, on\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nthe subject of the Panama Canal, its importance for the\r\nworld and its prospects on the eve of the new millennium.\r\nThis is a doubly significant honour because this is the\r\nyear that the United Nations is celebrating its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, 50 years during which it has accomplished a\r\nvery difficult though noble task in maintaining peace and\r\nfinding negotiated solutions for a manifold and diverse\r\nrange of international problems and conflicts.\r\nI must say, first, that the Panama Canal is a peaceful\r\nundertaking that in the 81 years it has been in operation has\r\nbeen an important element in the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the world’s peoples. The Panama Canal has\r\nmade a positive contribution to the economic development\r\nof many countries which find the interoceanic route the\r\ncheapest and most direct for transporting materials and\r\nproducts in their international trade.\r\nThe Panama Canal is part of the world’s transport\r\ninfrastructure. Despite the development of alternative\r\nsystems, the Canal will continue to play an important role\r\nin the world’s sea-borne trade. Last year, ships flying the\r\nflags of 78 countries used the Canal as they made over\r\n12,000 crossings of the isthmus, east-west and west-east.\r\nIn Washington, on 7 September 1977, the Heads of\r\nState and Government that were present at the signing of\r\nthe Canal Treaties, known as the “Torrijos-Carter Treaties”,\r\nrecognized\r\n“... the importance for the hemisphere, for trade and\r\nfor world shipping of agreements designed to ensure\r\nthe accessibility and continued neutrality of the\r\nPanama Canal”.\r\nThe Canal Treaties, signed 18 years ago, cover the full\r\nreversion of administration and control of the interoceanic\r\nwaterway to the Republic of Panama starting at noon on 31\r\nDecember 1999. This means that we Panamanians will be\r\nassuming an important historic responsibility at the birth of\r\na new century and a new millennium. We will not only be\r\nrecovering our principal natural resource and restoring the\r\nintegrity of our territory, thus consolidating the long process\r\nof independence; we will also be assuming, before the eyes\r\nof the world community and under the gaze of our national\r\ndestiny, the obligation to manage the Panama Canal so that\r\nthis great global shipping lane continues to function as\r\nefficiently, economically and safely as it has thus far and to\r\nmake the necessary investments to respond to the demands\r\nof its use.\r\nFacing this national commitment with a sense of\r\nresponsibility, the President of the Republic of Panama,\r\nMr. Ernesto Pérez Balladares, in an executive decree\r\ndated 25 January 1995, called for the holding of the\r\nUniversal Congress on the Panama Canal, which will take\r\nplace in Panama City from 7-10 September 1997. Historic\r\nprecedents exist for a Congress of this kind: the\r\nAmphictyonic Congress of Panama of 1826, convoked by\r\nSimón Bolívar, the Liberator, and the Congress convened\r\nby the Société de Géographie de Paris, under the\r\npresidency of Count Ferdinand de Lesseps, in Paris in\r\n1879.\r\nOne of the primary objectives of this Congress is to\r\nshow the international community, the maritime sector,\r\nthe users of the interoceanic waterway and those countries\r\nwhose international trade is closely linked to and\r\ndependent upon the operation of the Canal that the\r\ntransition from a North American Canal to a Panamanian\r\nCanal is taking place normally through a coordinated\r\nprocess of transfer of responsibilities.\r\nThe Transition Committee appointed by the\r\nGovernment of Panama has been operating for several\r\nmonths now. It is responsible for the adoption of\r\nmeasures and initiatives to ensure the smooth operational\r\ntransition of the Canal’s entire administration to\r\nPanamanian hands. To achieve this goal, the Panamanian\r\nTransition Committee works in close and harmonious\r\ncooperation with its North American counterpart.\r\nIt is important to emphasize that the Governments of\r\nPanama and of the United States are carrying out an\r\nexpeditious transition process aimed at ensuring the\r\ncontinued and efficient functioning of the interoceanic\r\nwaterway and at providing structures and policies that\r\nwill give users full confidence of having continued access\r\nto the Canal.\r\nThe convocation of the Universal Congress on the\r\nPanama Canal and its holding two years from now\r\nconstitute part of the transition process, in the area of\r\nplanning the future strategy for the Canal. The Congress\r\nseeks the lofty goal of bringing together statesmen and\r\nrepresentatives of Governments, of international\r\norganizations, of public and private academic institutions,\r\nof the shipping community and of international transport\r\ncompanies so that they may consider together the role that\r\nthe Panama Canal should play in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Government of Panama hopes that the Congress\r\nwill not only lead the community of users of the Canal to\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nreaffirm its full confidence in Panamanians’ ability to\r\nmanage the Canal efficiently and effectively in the coming\r\ncentury, but will also make them feel that they are\r\nparticipants in the formulation of administrative policies and\r\npractices that make it possible for management to serve\r\nthem, and the economic community in general better. It is\r\nworth noting that Panama’s confidence in its ability to\r\nmanage the Canal is based, inter alia, on the fact that\r\ncurrently more than 90 per cent of the staff that operate the\r\nCanal at various levels of responsibility are Panamanian,\r\nincluding the general manager.\r\nThe convocation of the Universal Congress of the\r\nPanama Canal corresponds with my country’s objective\r\nwith the spirit that moves it to align itself with the new\r\ntrends towards a global partnership for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, which implies the necessity to formulate,\r\nthrough cooperation, a balanced, integrated approach to\r\nissues concerning the environment, trade and development.\r\nAmong its main goals are the promotion of international\r\ncooperation in order to achieve an orderly, sustainable use\r\nand development of the resources of the Atlantic and\r\nPacific Oceans and a rational exploitation and development\r\nof the Canal basin and the coastal areas that gives priority\r\nconsideration to the water requirements for the Canal’s\r\noperation.\r\nWe already have a draft agenda for the Universal\r\nCongress on the Panama Canal. The Congress will see\r\nstudies on policies and legal structures and forecasts of\r\ninternational maritime demands. In addition, studies on\r\nhuman resources, operations and maintenance, water\r\nresources and protection of the environment will be carried\r\nout. Panama will report to the participants in the Congress\r\non what it has done in terms of organizational structure,\r\ngoals and objectives, legal framework and administrative\r\nrules and procedures for the operations of the Canal starting\r\nin the year 2000. Workshops will be held on canal traffic,\r\nthe financial structure of the enterprise, toll policy, strategic\r\nplanning and the Treaty concerning the Permanent\r\nNeutrality of the Panama Canal.\r\nDuring its four days of work, the Congress will deal\r\nwith the issue of broadening the Gaillard Cut, the third set\r\nof locks, forecasts of long-term demand and the viewpoints\r\nand ideas of the users of the Canal. It will also deal with\r\nmaritime agencies, the operation of ports, the supplying of\r\nvessels, repair services, the registry of Panamanian vessels\r\nand the market for the transshipment of cargo.\r\nThe Government of Panama will make a presentation\r\nto the Congress on investment opportunities in the areas\r\nadjacent to the banks of the Canal that have reverted to\r\nPanama and that will serve to support and develop\r\nshipping and world commerce. The general and regional\r\nplan on the use of reverted areas will be introduced, along\r\nwith an analysis of the many opportunities for developing\r\nindustrial and commercial centres in these areas.\r\nThe Universal Congress on the Panama Canal\r\nconstitutes in essence an invitation to the international\r\ncommunity to come to Panama in September 1997 so that\r\ntogether we may cast a view to the future and jointly\r\nexamine the Canal’s role in the development of\r\ninternational trade in the new world full of challenges and\r\nopportunities that will arrive with the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.13.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.13?\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.13 was adopted (resolution\r\n50/12).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 162?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 40 (continued)\r\nBuilding a peaceful and better world through sport\r\nand the Olympic Ideal\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.15)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative\r\nof Saint Lucia, His Excellency the Honourable Edward\r\nInnocent, Minister for Community Development, Social\r\nAffairs, Youth, Sports, Cooperatives and Local\r\nGovernment.\r\nMr. Innocent (Saint Lucia): The English claim that\r\nthe Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of\r\nEton, and I accept the theory that the discipline and skills\r\nrequired in war can best be inculcated through the\r\nattitudes acquired and encouraged on the field of sport.\r\nBut today, the joy of having the sporting achievements of\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nthe International Olympic Committee aired in this Assembly\r\nis clouded by the news of the untimely death of Prime\r\nMinister Rabin. This is cause for serious reflection. We\r\ncannot be too smug about battles being won on the basis of\r\nthe virtues of the world of sport. We must use the\r\ncoincidence of these two events to reflect on the ideal that\r\nour playing-fields should become polytechnics for peace,\r\nnot preparatory schools for war.\r\nIt is fitting that Ministers for Sport, like myself, can\r\ncome to this Mecca of freedom, justice and equality to\r\nexpress openly our views on the value of sport to our\r\ncommunities. The Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, lit the torch for us when he said:\r\n“The Olympic Ideal is a hymn to tolerance and\r\nunderstanding between people and cultures”.\r\nIn my country, Saint Lucia, it is precisely this perception\r\nthat induced us to become members of the International\r\nOlympic Committee (IOC) and to work hard to ensure that\r\nour National Olympic Committee lives up to the ideals of\r\nthe IOC.\r\nSmall countries face tremendous disadvantages in the\r\nfiercely competitive world of sport. We cannot afford the\r\nbasic facilities to train and develop our athletic skills. We\r\nhave no adequate stadium for our games, no cinder track,\r\nno extensive coaching facilities for the many fine players\r\nfrom rural areas, who are destined to remain unknown.\r\nDespite our shortage of facilities, however, we are\r\nattempting to establish mini-stadiums island-wide, and we\r\nhave started the erection of a national sports centre in the\r\nsouthern part of the island. It is our aim to construct multi-\r\npurpose courts in various communities around the island.\r\nThis is part of a general review of our national sports\r\npolicy.\r\nOur size and our indigence have not prevented us from\r\nproducing athletes of world class, such as Rick Wayne,\r\nwho stormed the heights of body-building by winning the\r\nMr. World, Mr. America and Mr. Universe titles. There is\r\nhope. The International Olympic Committee has already\r\ndemonstrated, throughout the developing world, that it is\r\ndedicated to bringing diverse peoples together in bonds of\r\nfriendship and good will. It has also shown its intention to\r\nhelp disadvantaged young people to attain great heights in\r\nsports.\r\nI can safely say that the Olympic Movement has\r\ncreated a level playing-field. People of diverse cultural\r\nbackgrounds, varying religious beliefs and different\r\nideologies have been brought together to compete with\r\none another under acceptable rules. The coming together\r\nof peoples, nations and ethnic groups is a fundamental\r\nelement of global human existence. I commend and laud\r\nthe International Olympic Committee for this feat.\r\nToday, every nation wants to be part of the Olympic\r\nIdeal. Every nation wants to be part of this great\r\ninternational global fraternity. This is because we\r\nunderstand the role of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee in our physical, mental, psychological, social\r\nand human development. Indeed, the International\r\nOlympic Committee has served as a model for other\r\ninternational sporting bodies and other organizations. In\r\nthat regard, its role as an arbiter in times of conflict is\r\nsignificant.\r\nThe Olympic Ideal is the promotion of international\r\nunderstanding among the youth of the world through\r\nsports and culture, in order to advance the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of humankind. There is no doubt that we\r\nhave been building a peaceful and better world through\r\nsport and the Olympic Ideal.\r\nAs indicated in resolution 49/29 of 1994, the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee is collaborating with\r\nrelevant organs and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system. This is evident in areas such as the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme,\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme, the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\nand the World Health Organization.\r\nFinally, we have recognized in this debate the\r\ntremendous benefits that sports can bring to the frustrated\r\nyouth in our communities, who move rudderless through\r\nlife, with no value system to support them. We have seen\r\nthe value of tolerance and understanding, which are\r\nnurtured on the field of sport. We salute the joint efforts\r\nof the United Nations and the International Olympic\r\nCommittee in bringing the peoples of the world to mutual\r\nenjoyment of the physical, cultural and spiritual riches\r\nthat this Earth offers. The Government and the people of\r\nSaint Lucia wish to express their full support for these\r\ntwo institutions as they celebrate their respective\r\nanniversaries.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the representative of Qatar has requested\r\npermission to participate in the debate on this item.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nInasmuch as the list of speakers was closed yesterday\r\nmorning, I ask the Assembly whether there is any objection\r\nto the inclusion of this delegation.\r\nAs I see no objection, Qatar is included in the list of\r\nspeakers.\r\nThe next speaker is Mr. Vetumbuavi Veii, Director at\r\nthe Ministry of Youth and Sports of Namibia.\r\nMr. Veii (Namibia): It is indeed an honour for me to\r\nrepresent my country in this Assembly during its\r\nconsideration of draft resolution A/50/L.15, entitled\r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic Ideal”.\r\nThe presence, during this special commemorative\r\nmeeting of the United Nations General Assembly, of\r\nseveral Ministers responsible for sports in their respective\r\nStates, as well as of the President of the International\r\nOlympic Committee, His Excellency Mr. Juan Antonio\r\nSamaranch, and other key figures of the Olympic\r\nMovement is eloquent testimony to the fact that sports can\r\nbe a force for peace and, therefore, can contribute to the\r\nresolution of internal and global problems.\r\nIt is well known that my country, Namibia, was\r\ninvolved in a bitter war against foreign domination and the\r\npolicy of apartheid. Our country was divided along racial\r\nlines. However, in 1990, when we attained independence,\r\nour President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Nujoma, introduced\r\nthe policy of national reconciliation, and sport was\r\ndesignated as one of the driving forces to unite our people.\r\nAlthough health and education account for the highest\r\nproportion of our national budget, a modest percentage is\r\nallocated to the Ministry of Youth and Sports. However, we\r\nhave managed to establish basic sporting facilities for our\r\npeople, particularly in areas neglected during the previous\r\ndispensation. And we intend to establish such facilities\r\nthroughout the country by the year 2000.\r\nAs a country that was involved in a long and bitter\r\nstruggle for liberation, Namibia has many disabled people\r\nand, therefore, has created an organization for the\r\nphysically disabled. As a matter of fact, one of our disabled\r\nathletes, Mr. Greyling, has been invited to participate in the\r\nupcoming New York Marathon.\r\nIn spite of the small size of our population, coupled\r\nwith lack of funds, Namibia as a country has nevertheless\r\nmanaged to participate in each and every major sporting\r\nevent. Since we attained independence five years ago, we\r\nhave taken part in the Barcelona Olympic Games, the\r\nCommonwealth Games, the World Athletic\r\nChampionships, the World Cup Preliminary Competition,\r\nthe All Africa Games and the African Cup of Nations.\r\nIn Namibia today, former enemies are now\r\ncompeting as opponents locally and as teammates\r\ninternationally when representing Namibia. The role that\r\nsport has played to reconcile our people cannot be\r\noveremphasized.\r\nSince I mentioned the Barcelona Olympic Games,\r\nallow me to avail myself of this opportunity to thank His\r\nExcellency Mr. Samaranch — first, for accepting Namibia\r\nas a family member of the Olympic Movement\r\nimmediately after our independence. Our acceptance in\r\nthe Olympic Movement opened the way for one of our\r\ntop athletes, Frankie Fredericks, to win two silver medals\r\nin the 100- and 200-metre sprints. And, believe me, his\r\nvictories were indeed powerful motivating and unifying\r\nforces for our people. Each and every Namibian,\r\nregardless of his or her colour, social background or\r\nreligion, supported Frankie. Again, this is testimony to the\r\nreconciliatory role that sport can play.\r\nSecondly, I would also like to thank the President of\r\nthe International Olympic Committee for taking time to\r\nvisit Namibia last year. It was indeed gratifying for us, as\r\nNamibians, to see that Mr. Samaranch made time to visit\r\nall the members of his Committee, including the small\r\nones, such as Namibia.\r\nAnd it was indeed encouraging to listen to him\r\nyesterday, when he said:\r\n“It is vital that the National Olympic Committees\r\nmaintain excellent relations with their respective\r\nGovernments, and especially with the ministries of\r\nyouth and sports.”\r\nThe fact that Governments recognize the autonomy of the\r\nNational Olympic Committees is important, but it is\r\nequally important for these Committees to realize that\r\nthey do not operate in a vacuum. Therefore, harmonious\r\nrelationships between Governments and National Olympic\r\nCommittees are of paramount importance for the future of\r\nsport, and they should be encouraged by the highest\r\nauthorities.\r\nI am happy to inform the General Assembly that the\r\nNamibia National Olympic Committee has, in view of the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nforthcoming 1996 Olympic Games, started a programme to\r\npromote Olympism among our young people in Namibia.\r\nOne of its first activities was the publication of a brochure\r\nunder the patronage of His Excellency the President of the\r\nRepublic of Namibia. “Operation Excellence”, as it is\r\ntermed, is aimed at enabling the best of our Namibian\r\nathletes to take part in the 1996 Olympics. This is a\r\ncombined effort by the Ministries of Youth and Sports, and\r\nBasic Education and Culture, and by the National Olympic\r\nCommittee.\r\nFinally, work is also already under way to launch the\r\npreparation stage for Namibia’s participation in the\r\nCommonwealth Games in Sydney.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Bangladesh, Mr. M. Shahjahan Omar.\r\nMr. Omar (Bangladesh): It is indeed a great pleasure\r\nfor me to speak on this auspicious occasion in which we\r\ncelebrate, during this fiftieth United Nations, year the\r\ncentennial anniversary of the modern Olympic Games. Both\r\nthese occasions are imbued with a special ambience of hope\r\nand idealism and a sense and spirit of optimism.\r\nSport is a singularly unifying factor, bringing together\r\npeople from all nations, from all cultures and from all\r\nbackgrounds to strive for the same goal of excellence. The\r\npursuit of this goal unleashes the potency of youth,\r\nallowing it to be channelled and translated into a\r\nmultiplicity of constructive endeavours for society.\r\nSport is certainly an invitation to competition — but\r\nit is competition conditioned by tolerance and full respect\r\nfor the rights of others. This inherent element of restraint\r\nand its studied exercise is a crucial norm of democracy.\r\nSport and the inculcation of this spirit of equality, tolerance\r\nand dignity are thus a vital means to train youth around the\r\nworld to live in harmony and cooperation while striving for\r\nperfection.\r\nSport is an ideal mechanism to bring about cohesion\r\namong different countries, to promote understanding and to\r\nbring peoples and nations closer together. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the Olympic Ideal contributes to this end and\r\nthat the call for an Olympic Truce, in which all hostilities\r\nmust cease during the Games, is an objective worth\r\nsupporting, to mobilize not only youth around the globe in\r\nthe cause of peace but, through them, all humankind.\r\nThe Olympic Ideal enjoins upon us all to build a\r\nbetter, more peaceful and united world. By placing the\r\nspirit and ideal of sportsmanship in the forefront, it paces\r\nhumanity to strive for the better things of life, for peace,\r\nprosperity and progress. Bangladesh is committed to the\r\nspirit of the Olympic Ideal, which has as its foundation\r\nthe call for understanding, tolerance, solidarity and\r\ndignity.\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.15 supports increased\r\ncooperation between the International Olympic Committee\r\nand the United Nations in different social programmes.\r\nFurthermore, it encourages Governments to devote\r\nattention to the development of youth and a wide variety\r\nof youth-related activities. We are therefore particularly\r\nhappy to cosponsor the draft resolution before the\r\nAssembly and commend it for adoption by acclamation.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call upon the\r\nrepresentative of Suriname, Mrs. Irma E. Klein-Loemban\r\nTobing.\r\nMrs. Klein-Loemban Tobing (Suriname): On\r\nbehalf of my delegation, I would like to extend sincere\r\ngreetings and words of praise to the President of the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee, Mr. Juan Antonio\r\nSamaranch, and at the same time to thank him most\r\nheartily for all his efforts towards the sport movement in\r\nmy country. Allow me, at the same time, to extend\r\ngreetings to and express solidarity with all delegations\r\nparticipating in this important meeting.\r\nIt is a privilege to be a cosponsor of this widely\r\nsupported draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/50/L.15, which promotes sport and the Olympic Ideal,\r\nwith a view to building a peaceful and better world and\r\nstrengthening the moral and physical capacities of our\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Suriname Olympic Committee gained broad\r\nsupport from the President of the Republic of Suriname\r\nand the Ministers of Education, Sport and Culture;\r\nForeign Affairs; and Social Welfare, when they were\r\npresented with the letters of the President of the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee on the Olympic Truce\r\nand the Barcelona document regarding the “Earth pledge”.\r\nOn that occasion the President of the Republic of\r\nSuriname assured the Suriname Olympic Committee and,\r\nthrough that organization, the International Olympic\r\nCommittee that the Surinamese Government always\r\nsupports peace, good relations between nations and the\r\nendeavour of the Olympic Movement to take good care of\r\nthe environment.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nSport unites. Sport promotes love and understanding\r\namong peoples and nations. On various occasions — in\r\nSeoul, South Korea, in 1988; in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992;\r\nand recently, in August 1995, in Göteborg, Sweden —\r\nSuriname has experienced the importance of the presence\r\nof young male and female sport heroes in putting a country\r\nin the spotlight and at the same time in promoting and\r\nimproving the well-being of its peoples.\r\nMy delegation is fully aware that in moments of\r\nthreats to and violations of peace and human dignity, it is\r\nimportant strongly to promote the participation of our\r\nyoung people in particular in national as well as\r\ninternational sport movements, in order to create peace,\r\nunderstanding, love, respect, harmony among peoples, to\r\nimprove the quality of life and to translate into reality the\r\nwell-known principle of mens sana in corpore sano — a\r\nhealthy spirit in a healthy body.\r\nThe Republic of Suriname is very grateful for the\r\nopportunity to participate in the international sport\r\nmovement through its governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations and through its Ministry of Education, Sport\r\nand Culture, its Surinamese Olympic Committee and other\r\nnational sport organizations such as the National Special\r\nOlympics Movement.\r\nIt is only within the context of the international sport\r\nmovement that the Surinamese sport movement can achieve\r\nknowledge, know-how, strength, inspiration and\r\nsportspersonship.\r\nSince Suriname really wants to be an integral part of\r\na peaceful and better world, we therefore again commit\r\nourselves to continued and strong participation in the\r\nOlympic Movement and its ideals throughout the world, in\r\norder to promote peace, friendship, tolerance, dignity,\r\nhealth, harmony, solidarity and human rights in general in\r\ntoday’s world. The yearly Inter-Guyanese Games between\r\nthe young people of Guyana, French Guyana and Suriname\r\nand the useful cooperation in the field of sport between the\r\nNetherlands Antilles, Aruba, Suriname and the Netherlands\r\nmust be placed in this context.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me, on behalf of my delegation,\r\nto commend sport leaders all over the world for their\r\ntireless efforts to train children, young people, and\r\nsportswomen and sportsmen to become true servants of the\r\nOlympic Ideal — true servants of peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Kuwait, Mr. Saleh Alnafeesi, Deputy\r\nGeneral Director for Youth Affairs.\r\nMr. Alnafeesi (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I am very pleased to see the interest of this\r\nOrganization in young people and sports and the role this\r\nplays in international affairs, and I am pleased also at the\r\nfact that General Assembly meetings are dealing with this\r\ntopic. This is a positive sign.\r\nWhen we speak today of the Olympic Ideal which\r\naims basically at strengthening the concepts of peace and\r\nbrotherhood between peoples, we take this ideal to mean\r\nthe renunciation of anything that would stand in the way\r\nof the new world order and obstruct its march towards the\r\nnoble objectives of peaceful coexistence and the\r\nstrengthening of the principles of security and stability\r\nand friendship, which are fundamental to the future of our\r\npeoples on the eve of the twenty-first century.\r\nToday we are commemorating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, repository of the hopes\r\nof peoples in a continued life of safety and dignity. Next\r\nsummer, the XXVI Olympic Games will be held in\r\nAtlanta, USA. The fact that this will coincide with the\r\nhundredth anniversary of the Olympic Games,\r\ndemonstrates the international community’s interest in\r\nensuring the success of such events, wherein the world\r\nreaffirms its optimism with regard to the role of sport and\r\nof the activities of youth in consolidating the hopes of\r\npeoples in peaceful coexistence.\r\nWhile this meeting is held in reaffirmation of the\r\nnoble Olympic Ideal, the athletic circles of Kuwait miss\r\nmany athletes who continue to be incarcerated in the\r\nprisons of the Iraqi regime which ignores the international\r\nappeals calling for their release.\r\nSince the beginnings of the Olympic Movement, the\r\nKuwaiti Government has taken it upon itself to highlight\r\nthe importance of strengthening these high ideals, which\r\ncontribute to the creation of a civilized world. In this\r\nrespect, the State of Kuwait has accorded a high priority\r\nto supporting Olympic activities both at a world level and\r\na continental level, regardless of political and economic\r\ncircumstances. In so doing, Kuwait proceeded from the\r\nconviction that the collective efforts of the international\r\ncommunity should play an effective part in supporting the\r\nOlympic Movement at all levels without any hesitation as\r\nsuch support would bespeak the high importance which\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nshould be attached to the ideals and values of the Olympic\r\nMovement.\r\nKuwait’s young people made a point of participating,\r\nwith the support of the State of Kuwait, in Olympic and\r\nsports events at a time when Kuwait was under occupation\r\nby Iraq, a State which has not understood the aspirations of\r\nthe world’s peoples after peaceful coexistence. The\r\nparticipation of the young people of Kuwait in such events\r\nwas meant to send a message to the entire world that\r\nreaffirmed their rejection of injustice and political\r\nbackwardness and reiterated the call for a peaceful life —\r\na life of dignity in which the ideals of morality would be a\r\ntangible reality, not just mere words for propaganda\r\nconsumption.\r\nThe continent of Asia has honoured Kuwait by giving\r\nit the Chairmanship of the Asian Olympic Council since its\r\ninception. Kuwait also hosts the headquarters of the\r\nCouncil. This means that Kuwait shoulders greater\r\nresponsibilities in this area. We, therefore, reaffirm, from\r\nthis rostrum, that Kuwait supports this Asian Olympic\r\nedifice that aims at strengthening the ideals of peace and\r\nbrotherhood which the Asian peoples strive for, and rejects\r\nall divisiveness, bigotry, violence and extremism.\r\nKuwait, which has a principal seat on the International\r\nOlympic Committee, reaffirms its support for any project\r\nthat would be adopted by the United Nations to consolidate\r\nthe efforts aimed at strengthening the foundations of the\r\nnew world order. In this regard, we thank our friends, the\r\nPresident and members of the Olympic Committee, for their\r\npraiseworthy efforts to promote the Olympic Movement in\r\norder to translate into reality the aspirations of the world’s\r\nyouth.\r\nWe believe that States should focus on developing\r\nthose aspects of culture and knowledge that relate to\r\nOlympic ideals, either through direct inculcation at various\r\nlevels of education and practical application in the various\r\nareas of sport, or through the use of the media in raising\r\nthe general level of awareness regarding this subject. We\r\nare convinced that there is an urgent need to activate this\r\nvital area of youth activities by formulating a\r\ncomprehensive plan with well-defined objectives that would\r\nmake it possible to achieve the desired results even if\r\ncontinuous efforts are needed to review and reassess\r\nperformance and reformulate the plan in such a way that\r\nthe objectives may be achieved ultimately.\r\nWhile reaffirming what I have just said, I also wish to\r\ndraw attention to the need to take greater interest in\r\nprogrammes for the development of sports for the\r\ndisabled. Such programmes have become a sign of\r\ncivilized behaviour in those States that strive to integrate\r\nthe disabled into all aspects of life. Such States view the\r\ndisabled as a vital human resource whose productive\r\ncapacities must be put to good use.\r\nThe States of the world are also called upon to take\r\neffective action to deal with drug abuse and practices that\r\ndestroy the natural environment. The consequences of\r\ndealing permissively with such phenomena will be\r\ndisastrous and will threaten the future of sports and the\r\nprinciples of the Olympic Movement.\r\nWe wish the Assembly complete success and thank\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat deeply for the outstanding\r\nquality of the documents prepared for this meeting. Our\r\nbest wishes go also to the United States, the friendly\r\ncountry that will be hosting the 1996 Olympics Games in\r\nAtlanta.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Nigeria, Ms. C. O. Aivboraye.\r\nMs. Aivboraye (Nigeria): Permit me, first of all, on\r\nbehalf of the Nigerian delegation, to express heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of Israel\r\non the tragic loss of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. May\r\nhis soul rest in peace.\r\nThe idea of the inclusion of this item, “Building a\r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic\r\nIdeal”, on the agenda of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession emanated from resolution 49/29 of 7 December\r\n1994. Earlier, in resolution, 48/11 of 25 October 1993,\r\nthis body had called for all hostilities to cease during the\r\nWinter and Summer Olympic Games so as to enable the\r\nyouth of the world to participate in the Games without\r\nhindrance. It is in this context that the Nigerian delegation\r\nendorses the holding of this meeting of the General\r\nAssembly and welcomes the statement of the President of\r\nthe International Olympic Committee.\r\nSports are an instrument for promoting\r\nunderstanding between peoples and strengthening\r\nharmonious relationships between sportsmen and\r\nenthusiasts, in furtherance of the principles and objectives\r\nof the United Nations. The Olympic Ideal promotes\r\ninternational understanding, particularly among the youth\r\nof the world, through sports and culture. This is why my\r\ncountry attaches great importance to the development of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nsports and has continued to provide incentives for our youth\r\nto participate in international sports competitions.\r\nSimilarly, we played a constructive role in the\r\nformulation of resolution CM/Res.28(LXII) and its adoption\r\nby the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) at its sixty-second ordinary session, held in\r\nAddis Ababa last June. Also endorsed by the Assembly of\r\nHeads of State and Governments of the OAU, that\r\nresolution, inter alia, supports the appeal for the\r\ninternational community to observe an Olympic Truce, to\r\ncoincide with the next Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta,\r\nGeorgia. We share the conviction that such a Truce will\r\npermit wider participation in those Games.\r\nWe are convinced that the support of the international\r\ncommunity for the efforts of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee geared to the promotion of international\r\nunderstanding and equality between nations will be\r\ninvaluable for the success of the Games. We welcome the\r\nCommittee’s joint endeavours with the United Nations\r\nsystem in drawing attention in recent meetings to the\r\nrelationship between sports and drugs, sports and\r\nenvironment and sports and health.\r\nAs we prepare for the XXVI Olympic Games in\r\nAtlanta, Georgia, next year, we believe that an Olympic\r\nTruce will be the most positive sign of that support. We\r\ntherefore call for a reaffirmation of the Olympic Truce and\r\nits faithful observance by Member States, well ahead of the\r\nopening of the Games and thereafter.\r\nIt is in this spirit that my delegation is pleased to be\r\na sponsor of draft resolution A/50/L.15.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Hungary, Mr. István Náthon.\r\nMr. Náthon (Hungary): It was on 16 June 1894, in\r\nParis, that Baron Pierre de Coubertin introduced the idea of\r\nrenewing the ancient Olympic Games. Hungary, along with\r\n12 other countries, was present at that meeting and was one\r\nof the nine that immediately committed themselves to that\r\ninitiative. Now, more than 100 years later, we again commit\r\nourselves, with the same determination, to peace, the\r\nOlympic Ideal and the Olympic Truce.\r\nHungary became a sponsor of the draft resolution on\r\nthe Olympic Ideal this year. We attach great importance to\r\nthe General Assembly’s discussion of the agenda item\r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the\r\nOlympic Ideal”. We strongly believe that at present\r\nhumankind needs that peaceful and better world —\r\nunfortunately, not for the first time since 1896.\r\nThe cruel assassination of Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, the\r\nPrime Minister of Israel, reminds us again how difficult\r\nand long is the road leading towards a peaceful and better\r\nworld. To realize the dream of reaching such a world, we\r\ncertainly need peace between and within nations. From\r\nthis rostrum, I would like to offer my sincere condolences\r\nto the family of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and to the\r\npeople of Israel for their loss.\r\nSuccesses and defeats, winners and losers and smiles\r\nand tears have characterized the last 100 years all over\r\nthe world, both inside and outside sport stadiums. One\r\nshould not forget the applause and joy in the stadium in\r\nAthens 100 years ago, hailing the first winners of the\r\nmodern Olympic Games. One should also remember the\r\napplause in the stadium in Sarajevo in 1984, when that\r\ncity hosted the Winter Olympic Games. But one should\r\nalso remember that only a few years later the same\r\nstadium in Sarajevo became a concentration camp and\r\nthen a cemetery for the victims of a cruel war.\r\nWe, the States Members of the United Nations, can\r\nand should act together to prevent such tragedies from\r\noccurring again, anywhere. This is imperative, dictated by\r\nthe Olympic Ideal and by our conscience as well.\r\nIn 1894, in Paris, Hungarians applauded Baron\r\nPierre de Coubertin when he proposed the renewal of the\r\nancient Olympic Games. Hungarian sportsmen\r\nparticipated in the first Olympic Games held in Athens\r\nand won two gold medals. Since then, during this first\r\n100 years, Hungarian sportsmen have won 134 Olympic\r\ngold medals. We would like to express our hope that the\r\nnext 100 years will bring us another 134 gold medals.\r\nOnly 256 days separate us from the opening of the\r\ncentennial Olympic Games in Atlanta. The dream of the\r\nbest sportsmen, coaches and sports managers all over the\r\nworld is to win some gold medals in Atlanta. This is also\r\ntrue for Hungary.\r\nThe interrelationship between sport and peace is well\r\nknown. This has also been shown by our discussion\r\ntoday. The participation of Ministers of Youth and Sport\r\nin the consideration of this item today is a clear message\r\nthat sport, the Olympic Ideal and peace are really\r\ninseparable. The importance of our work is confirmed by\r\nthe presence of the President of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee, Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nWe salute the increasing number of joint endeavours\r\nof the International Olympic Committee and the United\r\nNations system. Hungary also recognizes and appreciates\r\nthe importance of cooperation between the Olympic\r\nMovement and the world of diplomacy. We believe that\r\nthis relationship cannot be proved more convincingly on our\r\nside than by the fact that the President of the Hungarian\r\nOlympic Committee and Vice-President of the International\r\nOlympic Committee, a former world fencing champion, is\r\nat the same time our Ambassador to Spain.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Ukraine, Mr. Borys Hudyma.\r\nMr. Hudyma (Ukraine) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine was unable to speak here\r\nyesterday, and we would therefore like today to convey our\r\nsincere condolences to the Government and people of Israel\r\non the death of the Prime Minister, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin. We\r\nwould also like to express our firm conviction that the\r\ncontinuation of the peace process in the Near East will be\r\nthe best tribute to the glorious memory of Mr. Rabin, and\r\na challenge to the forces standing in the way of a peaceful\r\nsettlement.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine considers that the item\r\nbefore us today, namely “Building a peaceful and better\r\nworld through sport and the Olympic Ideal”, is both\r\nimportant and timely. All of us today are still greatly under\r\nthe effect of the recent event of enormous historical\r\nsignificance, the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations rose from the ashes of the Second\r\nWorld War, the most destructive war in the history of\r\nmankind, and was called upon to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from all the horrors of war. Unfortunately\r\ntoday, in spite of all the efforts of the United Nations and\r\nthe tragic lessons of past wars, the world stands witness to\r\nthe fact that alongside successful moves towards a\r\nsettlement of the protracted conflicts of recent years, new\r\nhot-beds of tension continue to arise in various regions of\r\nthe world.\r\nIt is well known that one of the most effective ways\r\nto secure peace among conflicting parties since ancient\r\ntimes has been through sport, the Olympic Games, because\r\nfriendship among rivals has always and unfailingly been he\r\noutcome of any sporting event.\r\nThe tradition of ekecheria, the Olympic Truce, which\r\nwas born in Greece many centuries ago, is still timely today\r\nand impels nations to tolerance, cooperation, rewarding\r\ncompetition in sport and work. Sport is a universal means\r\nfor overcoming economic, social and individual problems.\r\nIt provides a real opportunity to come to know oneself\r\nand acquire human individuality. Sport helps to give us a\r\nbetter feel for the world around us and to look at it\r\nthrough the eyes of a healthy human being.\r\nWe in Ukraine realize that sport and the Olympic\r\nIdeal must be inculcated in young people at the earliest\r\nage and we are exerting every effort to that end. Today,\r\nUkraine has many sports schools for young people and\r\nchildren, physical education and Olympic training\r\ninstitutes, and advanced sports training schools. More than\r\n600,000 people are involved with these physical culture\r\nand sport establishments alone.\r\nSince Ukraine proclaimed its independence, a\r\nNational Olympic Committee has been set up, along with\r\n104 federations for new types of sport which have been\r\nrecognized by international organizations. Also, regular\r\nteams in 43 kinds of sport have been established, as have\r\na research institute for physical training and sport, the\r\nUkrainian higher institute for trainers and other sporting\r\nestablishments.\r\nActive work is being carried out in Ukraine to create\r\na national legislative and regulatory basis for sporting\r\nactivities. Thus, in December 1993, an act on physical\r\ntraining and sport in Ukraine came into force, and in June\r\n1994 a presidential decree on State support for the\r\ndevelopment of arts and sport in Ukraine was issued.\r\nIn recent years, Ukrainian sportsmen have notched\r\nup a series of major successes and brought many glorious\r\nvictories to our country. The names of many Ukrainian\r\nsportsmen, Olympic, world and European champions and\r\nmedal holders — Sergei Bubka in pole-vaulting; Oksana\r\nBayul in figure-skating; Inessa Kravets for the triple\r\njump; Dmitri Monakov for target shooting and many\r\nothers — are known all over the world.\r\nAt the Winter Olympics at Lillehammer, the\r\ncombined Ukrainian team, appearing for the first time as\r\nan independent team, came thirteenth out of 57 in the\r\nunofficial team ranking. This year, 1995, is the year of\r\nthe eliminating rounds for the Atlanta Olympics in which\r\nUkrainian sportsmen are also preparing to compete; they\r\nare now engaged in the sports struggle to win selection\r\nfor these jubilee games.\r\nToday, Ukraine is in a complex economic situation\r\nas a result of the problems arising from the transition\r\nfrom a command-type administration of the economy to\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\na market economy. Despite the grave difficulties our\r\ncountry is experiencing at this stage, the Government of\r\nUkraine is finding the necessary strength and resources for\r\nsuch an important aspect of young people’s upbringing as\r\nsport and physical training.\r\nWe see the facts and figures I have just given you as\r\nUkraine’s worthy contribution to the Year of Tolerance and\r\nwish to express our hope that the Olympic Ideal, common\r\nsense and mutual respect, and in the final analysis, lasting\r\npeace, health and well-being will prevail over the senseless\r\nchoice of hostility, crime, harmful practices and\r\nhopelessness.\r\nUkraine became a cosponsor of the draft resolution\r\nentitled “The Olympic Ideal” because we consider that all\r\nits provisions tally completely with the interests of our\r\ncountry and lay solid foundations for further consolidating\r\ninternational peace and security in the spirit of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the aims\r\nof the Olympic Movement. At the same time, we believe\r\nthat questions involving young people and sport must be\r\nmore fully reflected in United Nations documents in the\r\nfuture, in the context of the development of sport and\r\nphysical education. The comprehensive development of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Olympic Committee requires all-out support.\r\nFrom this rostrum, allow me to repeat what the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations said in the\r\nInternational Year of Sport and the Olympic Ideal. We\r\nbelieve that his words convey the profound meaning of the\r\norganic unity that governs the mutual development of sport\r\nand peace:\r\n“The Olympic Ideal is a hymn to tolerance and\r\nunderstanding between people and cultures. It is an\r\ninvitation to competition, but competition with respect\r\nfor others. In its way, Olympism is a school for\r\ndemocracy. In other words, there is a natural link\r\nbetween the ethic of the Olympic Games and the\r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations.”\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to call on Member States\r\nof the United Nations to do their utmost so that, on the eve\r\nof the hundredth anniversary of the revival of the Olympic\r\nGames, we can achieve, to the maximum extent, the\r\nrealization of the Olympic Ideal, in the interests of peace,\r\nsecurity and the harmonious development of humanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Mr. H. A. H.\r\nAl-Ni’mah, Permanent Representative of Qatar to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Al-Ni’mah (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI am pleased to address this august Assembly during its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 40, “Building a peaceful and\r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nI do not believe I would be mistaken in saying that\r\nthe Assembly discusses this item at this session in\r\nresponse to the needs of humanity in the time of detente\r\nand openness we now witness. I do not believe I would\r\nbe mistaken either in saying that such discussion will\r\ninspire young people who excel in sport and make it\r\npossible to devise the best means of developing the\r\nobjectives of the Olympic Movement and afford the\r\nUnited Nations an opportunity to lay down those\r\nnecessary foundations and to study those concepts that\r\nwould make it possible to formulate sports programmes\r\nwhich serve the cause of peace, security and stability in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe objectives of the Olympic Movement with all its\r\nactivities are organically linked to the objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations. There is therefore a need to consolidate\r\nrelations between the International Olympic Committee\r\nand this Organization in order to achieve the common\r\nobjectives called for by the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe Olympic Charter alike. This can be achieved only by\r\nfocusing on devising the necessary means and formulating\r\nthe programmes needed to educate the youth of the world\r\nin the virtues of peace and the values of tolerance. In\r\naddition, the youth of the world, while building their\r\nphysical strength, must be imbued with the Olympic spirit\r\nof cooperation and understanding and the renunciation of\r\ndiscrimination and unhealthy rivalry. This, in turn, will\r\nlead to the achievement of the desired cooperation in\r\nsports relations between Member States and orient those\r\nrelations towards the better and the truly perfect within\r\nthe context of honest sports competitiveness upon which\r\nthe Olympic Movement is based.\r\nThis would strengthen the objectives of the United\r\nNations system and ensure the equality of rights between\r\nnations. In those rights, the promotion of sport and the\r\nOlympic spirit constitutes a vital component that makes\r\nit possible to achieve the lofty human objectives of both\r\nOrganizations.\r\nProceeding from this, the State of Qatar, under the\r\nguidance of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamd Al\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nThani, has participated in all international efforts aimed at\r\nthe establishment of a prosperous international community\r\nin which youth enjoy the lofty values of sport and the\r\nOlympic spirit.\r\nQatar has also taken a keen interest in keeping up with\r\ndevelopments in the field of sports and thus created a sports\r\ninfrastructure that allows its generations to enjoy sport and\r\ngives them assistance in their development efforts and in\r\ntheir creative efforts to build a better future based on social\r\ndevelopment and the promotion of fruitful, human\r\ncreativity.\r\nIn order to achieve such objectives and to realize the\r\nvalues of the Olympic Movement so as to respond to the\r\nneeds of the youth in my country, Qatar continues to build\r\nsports facilities according to Olympic specifications. This\r\nenabled it to host the World Cup for Youth (FIFA) and the\r\n1994 Soccer Finals for Asia in the World Cup. It also\r\nenabled Qatar to make great achievements in its track and\r\nfield teams. Our delegations have participated in many\r\ninternational games and Qatar hopes to host Olympic\r\ncompetitions.\r\nThe State of Qatar continues to build youth hostels in\r\nvarious cities in order to achieve the lofty Olympic goals.\r\nThe international authority for youth and sport in\r\nQatar continues to make various efforts to develop\r\ncooperation between our youth and the youth of the rest of\r\nthe world in order to revive the Olympic values which call\r\nfor the establishment of links of friendship, cooperation and\r\nsolidarity amongst peoples. We believe that the promotion\r\nof such values is a means for the establishment of a better\r\nfuture for mankind in a new world where peoples have\r\nmore confidence in their own identity and their cultural\r\nspecificity and in which they continue their human march,\r\ninspired by the Olympic ideal, which expresses the\r\nconvergence of all human wills in order to continue the\r\nmutual relations of understanding and cooperation and in\r\nwhich the healthy competitiveness of sport would contribute\r\nto the building of a world of values, a world of love, a\r\nworld of friendship, a world that embraces the hopes of\r\nmankind in the best possible manner and that expresses the\r\ndesired human future which will be better, more beautiful\r\nand bright.\r\nFor all these reasons, the State of Qatar has joined in\r\nsponsoring the draft resolution before the Assembly and\r\nhopes that you will support it.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nBefore we take action on the draft resolution, I\r\nshould like to announce that the following countries have\r\nbecome cosponsors of draft resolution A/50/L.15:\r\nAzerbaijan, Bahrain, Barbados, the Central African\r\nRepublic, Colombia, the Czech Republic, the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Denmark, Honduras,\r\nIndonesia, Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland,\r\nKazakstan, Kuwait, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Madagascar, Malawi,\r\nMorocco, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria,\r\nNorway, Oman, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saint Lucia,\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and\r\nZimbabwe.\r\nWith these additional cosponsors we have achieved\r\na record number of cosponsors — to date 161.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.15.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt this\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/50/L.15 was adopted (resolution\r\n50/13).\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Italy.\r\nMr. Busacca (Italy): As announced by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Italy at yesterday’s meeting,\r\nthe delegation of Italy wishes to be a cosponsor of the\r\ndraft resolution just adopted.\r\nThe Acting President: That request has been noted.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n40?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 7 November 1995\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention of\r\nthe General Assembly to document A/INF/50/5/Add.2,\r\nwhich contains a tentative programme of work and schedule\r\nof plenary meetings for the rest of November and the\r\nmonth of December. The addendum supersedes document\r\nA/INF/50/5/Add.1 and announcements I have made since\r\nthe issuance of that addendum.\r\nThe schedule is being issued to assist delegations in\r\nplanning their work. For its part, the Secretariat will\r\nendeavour to ensure that the relevant documentation will be\r\navailable to delegations in advance of the discussion of any\r\ngiven agenda item.\r\nThe list of speakers for each of the items listed in\r\ndocument A/INF/50/5/Add.2 is now open. I should like to\r\npoint out that there are still a few agenda items for which\r\nno date has been indicated. I will announce the dates for\r\nthe consideration of those items in due course and\r\nsufficiently in advance. I will also keep the Assembly\r\ninformed of any additions or changes.\r\nAs I mentioned to the Assembly in my earlier\r\nannouncements, I hope to keep close to the schedule so that\r\nthe Assembly can discharge its responsibilities as\r\neffectively and expeditiously as possible. I again appeal to\r\nthose representatives submitting draft resolutions to do so\r\nsufficiently in advance of the dates fixed for consideration\r\nof items in order to give members adequate time to\r\nexamine them.\r\nI should like to reiterate that additional time is\r\nneeded for draft resolutions involving changes in the\r\nprogramme of work or additional expenditures, since\r\nthese will require the preparation of a statement of\r\nprogramme budget implications by the Secretary-General.\r\nFurthermore, the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee will need adequate time to review the\r\nprogramme budget implications of a draft resolution\r\nbefore the latter can be acted on by the Assembly.\r\nWhile on the subject of draft resolutions, I should\r\nlike to remind members that, in view of the number of\r\ndraft resolutions expected under agenda item 20, entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including\r\nspecial economic assistance”, and the possible need to\r\nhold consultations on them with a view to reaching\r\nconsensus, the deadline for submission of draft resolutions\r\nunder agenda item 20 will be Friday, 10 November 1995.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
