(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 45 (continued)\r\nThe situation in Central America: procedures for the\r\nestablishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress\r\nin fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/50/499)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/50/482)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.17)\r\nThe President: In connection with the item before the\r\nAssembly, I want to inform members that the note by the\r\nSecretary-General transmitting the third report of the\r\nDirector of the United Nations Mission for the Verification\r\nof Human Rights and of Compliance with the\r\nCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\r\nRights in Guatemala is contained in document A/50/482.\r\nI call on the representative of Nicaragua to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.17.\r\nMr. Pallais Arana (Nicaragua) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am honoured, on behalf of the delegations of\r\nCosta Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and\r\nNicaragua, to open the debate on the item “The situation in\r\nCentral America: procedures for the establishment of a firm\r\nand lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of\r\npeace, freedom, democracy and development”.\r\nOnly a few years ago, Central America was a region\r\noverwhelmed by social upheaval, war, authoritarianism\r\nand the dominance of military might over civil society.\r\nOnly a few years ago, our region was a focus of the\r\nEast-West conflict, and much of the cooperation it\r\nreceived from outside and a large proportion of our\r\nnational budgets were earmarked for military expenditures\r\nin the region. This had the effect of deepening military\r\nconflict and bringing about economic and social decline.\r\nJust a few years ago, we, and perhaps many of the\r\nother members here, were sceptical about the possibility\r\nof Central America enjoying democracy, peace and\r\nfreedom on the road to sustainable development that\r\nproclaimed the dignity of the human being as one of its\r\nmain objectives.\r\nToday we are deeply gratified to see that the efforts\r\nthat we in Central America and the international\r\ncommunity have made to build a new Central America\r\nhave dispelled this scepticism. Today we are convinced\r\nthat the enormous efforts invested in finding a solution to\r\nthe crisis in Central America have not been in vain, nor\r\nare we back where we started, with another conflict about\r\nto ignite.\r\nThroughout the gradual transition, the summit\r\nmeetings of the Central American Presidents have\r\ninstitutionalized the process of regional integration and\r\nhave given concrete form to the commitments undertaken\r\nin Esquipulas II, in which Central America pledged to\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nstruggle for peace and eradicate war, to ensure that dialogue\r\nprevailed over violence and reason over rancour, to give\r\nimpetus to real democratic processes, and to promote justice\r\nand respect for human rights.\r\nToday we can say that in the 1990s, with the end of\r\nthe cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism, an\r\nunprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the\r\ncourse of history and, for the first time, to secure the values\r\nof a democratic, just, peaceful, civil and reconciled society,\r\nwith Governments brought to power by the freely expressed\r\nwill of the people.\r\nWhen, in December 1990, the Central American\r\nPresidents declared Central America a region of peace,\r\nfreedom, democracy and development, there was also some\r\nscepticism about that. Nevertheless, it was not simply a\r\nrhetorical declaration. At that time, we were conscious and\r\nfully understood that we were undertaking an ambitious,\r\nfar-reaching and detailed project.\r\nIn considering the question of Central America, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been witness to the developments in\r\nthe situation in our subregion. The international community\r\nhas been able to ascertain through its own experience and\r\nat various summits that the Central American Presidents\r\nhave signed agreements that take account of the\r\ninterdependence of peace, development and democracy.\r\nThe new integration of Central America is a\r\nfundamental and indispensable instrument for regional\r\ndevelopment and hence for ensuring peace, security and\r\ndemocracy in our region. In this context, the main priorities\r\nin Central America have been defined, not only from the\r\npolitical and economic but also from the social standpoint.\r\nToday Central America has defined its new regional\r\nstrategy in the Alliance for Sustainable Development in\r\nCentral America. This new strategy was agreed upon in the\r\nDeclaration of Guacimo approved in Costa Rica in August\r\n1994 and the document signed at the Managua Environment\r\nSummit in October 1994, and at the International\r\nConference on Peace and Development, held a few days\r\nlater in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.\r\nWe think we should also bring to the Assembly’s\r\nattention the signing at the sixteenth meeting of Central\r\nAmerican Presidents, held in El Salvador in March 1995,\r\nof the Treaty on Central American Social Integration,\r\nwhich, as an integral part of the new Central American\r\nstrategy, is aimed at giving priority to social matters so as\r\nto ensure sustainable human development.\r\nAs a complement to the legal bases and values of\r\nthe integration process in the new Central America, the\r\nCentral American Presidents have proposed to discuss at\r\nthe impending summit, to be held in San Pedro Sula,\r\nHonduras, an agreement on democratic security —\r\nnamely, security in its integral sense — an agreement\r\nbased on the conviction that full and effective democracy\r\nis the best means for promoting trust between nations and\r\ncitizens.\r\nThe new principles of regional integration are based\r\non respect for life in all its forms; constant improvements\r\nin the quality of life; respect for the vitality and diversity\r\nof our land; peace, participatory democracy; respect for\r\nand the promotion and protection of human rights, and\r\nrespect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our\r\npeoples; the economic integration of our region with the\r\nrest of the world; and a responsibility that spans\r\ngenerations for sustainable development.\r\nWithin this new plan for regional integration, the\r\nnew Central American Integration System (SICA) is the\r\nbasic framework for such integration, as a means to\r\nharmonize efforts in the economic, social, cultural and\r\npolitical development spheres in Central America in order\r\nto consolidate the interdependence of democracy, security\r\nand development, inseparable elements of a new pattern\r\nof Central American security. For this, Central America\r\nwishes to thank the General Assembly for granting\r\nobserver status to the Central American Integration\r\nSystem (SICA) on 12 October 1995.\r\nIn our efforts to ensure peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in our region, we can say that in Central\r\nAmerica confrontation and military solutions to conflicts\r\nare a thing of the past. We believe in the application of\r\nthe principle of the peaceful solution of disputes, in\r\ndialogue and in negotiation. Central America favours and\r\nsupports international law. In this spirit, Central America\r\nsupports the good-offices role of the Secretary-General\r\nand the development of United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations within the framework of the Agenda for Peace.\r\nAn example of this is the work of the United\r\nNations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and\r\nof Compliance with the Commitments of the\r\nComprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA), which, according to the\r\nSecretary-General’s reports, has witnessed the agreements\r\nreached by the Government of Guatemala and Unidad\r\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) on\r\nmatters of human rights, indigenous populations,\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nsocio-economic matters and the agrarian situation. We are\r\ncertain that the Guatemalan people will be equal to the task\r\ndemanded by the times and that the negotiating process in\r\nwhich they are involved will be successful.\r\nIn El Salvador, the process initiated as a result of the\r\npeace agreements between the Government of El Salvador\r\nand the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional\r\nis still moving forward, and its success has contributed to\r\nthe progress in the transition the country is experiencing.\r\nWe are pleased with the renewal of the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador\r\n(ONUSAL), which shows support for the efforts the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador and society at large are making\r\nto finalize the outstanding aspects of the peace agreements.\r\nIn Nicaragua, the experience of the support group\r\nmade up of Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and\r\nSweden, in accordance with resolutions 48/161 and 49/137,\r\nhas shown that the United Nations is able to take innovative\r\ninitiatives to support the processes of transition to peace,\r\ndemocracy and development; this is shown also by the\r\nadequate levels of technical and financial support given to\r\nour country in the preparation of a strategy for national\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt the International Colloquium on Post-Conflict\r\nReconstruction Strategies, held in Austria in June 1995, it\r\nwas stated that there must be a broad response to a\r\ncountry’s needs in consolidating peace after a conflict. This\r\nwas a particular challenge for the United Nations system,\r\nwhose main objective is the integration of activities much\r\nmore than the simple coordination of activities. At that\r\nColloquium, emphasis was placed on giving a human face\r\nto the process, as well as on the situation and the standards\r\nof living of peoples whose lives had been devastated by the\r\nwar and who had had great expectations of a “peace\r\ndividend”.\r\nCentral America can only agree with those\r\nobservations, since in the past the concept of peace did not\r\nhave an integral characteristic nor did it have the dimension\r\nand scope it now has; it was limited, at various times, to\r\nthe ending of conflicts.\r\nThe Secretary-General, by introducing in his Agenda\r\nfor Peace the new element of the consolidation of peace\r\nafter conflicts, has brought an important critical vision to\r\nthe global framework of United Nations activities for peace.\r\nBy introducing this new concept, he has broken the old\r\nmodel that limited United Nations activities to the mere\r\ncessation of hostilities and the ending of armed\r\nconfrontations.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has stated, it is now a\r\nquestion of dealing with the very causes of the conflict\r\nand not merely with their superficial manifestations. We\r\nmust now put an end to the deeper roots of crises —\r\neconomic despair, social injustice and political oppression.\r\nOnce again, Central America bears witness to the\r\nfact that these concepts can become a reality. Central\r\nAmerica is convinced that our region offers the conditions\r\nnecessary to make it a model for the solution of conflicts\r\n— solutions by which peace and democracy are\r\nconsolidated through integral developments and through\r\npolitical settlements that include the elements necessary\r\nfor establishing the interdependency of “An Agenda for\r\nPeace” and an “An Agenda for Development”. This task\r\nhas not yet been concluded.\r\nCentral America feels that just as the International\r\nConference on Central American Refugees (CIREFCA)\r\nand the Economic Cooperation Plan for Central America\r\n(PEC) served as an example to be applied in other\r\nsituations, Central America will also be a successful\r\nexample of what the United Nations can do, with the\r\nsupport of the international community and while\r\nrespecting the sovereignty and independence of States, in\r\nthe field of consolidating peace and using preventive\r\ndiplomacy to end conflicts.\r\nInternational assistance and cooperation for\r\nconsolidating peace and facilitating development in\r\nsupport of the Alliance for Sustainable Development in\r\nCentral America — the subject of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport in document A/50/534 — provides us with an\r\nadequate framework for the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community to continue to cooperate with\r\nCentral America.\r\nTo conclude, we wish to acknowledge once again\r\nthat on the road we have travelled we have not been\r\nalone and that the contribution of the United Nations, the\r\ninternational community and, in particular, those countries\r\nthat have constantly supported us, has been essential in\r\nconsolidating peace in our region.\r\nIn presenting the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/50/L.17, we wish to direct the Assembly’s\r\nattention to the new strategy for sustainable development\r\nin Central America, to the provision of support for the\r\npeace process in Guatemala, to the consolidation of peace\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nin El Salvador and to the economic and social\r\nreconstruction of Nicaragua, as well as to Nicaragua’s\r\nrequest for observers for the electoral process in 1996. At\r\nthe same time, we wish to bring the Assembly up to date\r\non the most recent efforts undertaken by Central America\r\nin the peace and regional integration processes.\r\nWe have gone most of the way, and yet much remains\r\nto be done to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.\r\nWe insist on the need to overcome extreme poverty, for\r\nwhich greater efforts are required. We hope that in this task\r\nthe international community and the United Nations will\r\ncontinue their cooperation with Central America and that\r\nthe draft resolution that we have submitted will be adopted\r\nby consensus.\r\nMr. Albin (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMexico has very close and fruitful relations with the\r\ncountries of Central America. We are bound not only\r\ngeographically but also by close historical and cultural ties.\r\nCentral America has always been of prime importance in\r\nthe international affairs of my country. We have followed\r\nwith particular attention the positive developments which\r\nhave taken place in the region in recent years, and we\r\nwelcome the determined efforts of the countries in the\r\nregion to strengthen their institutions and to achieve firm\r\nand lasting peace.\r\nThe signing in Mexico City by the Government of\r\nGuatemala and the Unidad Nacional Revolucionaria\r\nGuatemalteca (UNRG) of the Agreement on Identity and\r\nRights of the Indigenous People, and the negotiations to\r\nconclude an agreement on socio-economic aspects and the\r\nagrarian situation constitute very important progress in the\r\npeace process, and they deserve the international\r\ncommunity’s support.\r\nGiven the importance of the present electoral process\r\nin that country, we also welcome the Contadora Declaration\r\nsigned by the Guatemalan political forces last August in\r\nwhich a commitment was made to ensure that the\r\nGovernment that resulted from the elections would respect\r\nthe agreements negotiated to date by the present\r\nGovernment and the UNRG.\r\nThe extension of the mandate of the United Nations\r\nMission for the Verification of Human Rights and of\r\nCompliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive\r\nAgreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA)\r\nlast September is a clear expression of the international\r\ncommunity’s continuing political support of the peace\r\nprocess in Guatemala. The Mission’s work has been very\r\npositive. It is widely recognized and respected in\r\nGuatemalan society. MINUGUA must continue to have\r\nthe capacity and the facilities to fulfil the mandate given\r\nit and must continue to contribute to strengthening the\r\nnational institutions and entities entrusted with promoting\r\nand protecting human rights in Guatemala. We are\r\nconfident that the necessary measures will be taken to\r\napply the Mission’s recommendations.\r\nPeace is an essential component in confronting\r\neconomic and social challenges. Dialogue and negotiation\r\nare excellent mechanisms for achieving this end. We urge\r\nthe Government of Guatemala and the Unidad\r\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) to\r\nredouble their efforts and to demonstrate their political\r\nwill to accelerate negotiations. The speedy conclusion of\r\nan agreement on a firm and lasting peace is in the best\r\ninterest of both parties, of Guatemala and of the United\r\nNations.\r\nExceptional progress has been made in El Salvador.\r\nThe peace process is proof today of the political\r\npossibilities that open up when the will of the parties\r\nexists. It is also the successful result of international\r\nsupport for the Salvadoran people’s efforts. After years of\r\nviolence and uncertainty, El Salvador is today in the stage\r\nof consolidating the peace process; of building and\r\nstrengthening its political, economic and social\r\ninstitutions; and of perfecting its structures so that,\r\nthrough dialogue, it can harness the plurality and the\r\ndifferences inherent in all contemporary societies.\r\nThe international community, through the United\r\nNations, is fully committed to continue to support El\r\nSalvador in its consolidation of a lasting and durable\r\npeace. The international community’s commitment to\r\npeace, stability and development in that country was\r\nrecently reaffirmed by the extension of the Mission of the\r\nUnited Nations in El Salvador (MINUSAL).\r\nMexico appreciates the work done by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Special Representative in El Salvador\r\nthrough MINUSAL. We recognize the Salvadoran\r\nGovernment’s commitment to completing the\r\nimplementation of all pending matters of the peace\r\nagreement and we encourage it to persist with this\r\nobjective.\r\nWe are convinced that progress in political and\r\ninstitutional areas in Central America will be achieved\r\nonly if it is accompanied by similar progress in the area\r\nof economic development, as well as by a decisive\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nendorsement of the reconstruction of the social fabric of\r\nthose nations.\r\nWe are well aware of the efforts made by the\r\nNicaraguan people to counteract the consequences of war\r\nand natural disasters. We consider the support given by the\r\ninternational community to Nicaragua for economic and\r\nsocial reconstruction to be of particular importance. Mexico\r\nwill continue to participate in the Nicaragua Support Group\r\nand in bilateral cooperation.\r\nThe international community’s support for Central\r\nAmerica must be strengthened now that the countries have\r\ntaken decisive steps to attain peace. Central America\r\nrequires financial resources and technical support to rebuild\r\nand consolidate political, economic and social institutions.\r\nMexico will continue to fulfil its commitment to\r\ncontribute to a lasting peace and to the development of the\r\nregion. We will do this in a most positive spirit in the areas\r\ndecided on by the Central Americans themselves.\r\nMr. Murayama (Japan): It is recalled that the United\r\nNations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) was\r\nestablished in 1991 to help guide El Salvador towards the\r\ncreation of a society in which democratic order, the rule of\r\nlaw and respect for human rights would prevail. It\r\nsuccessfully completed its tasks this past April. Looking\r\nback at the history of United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations in Central America, beginning in 1989 with the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Group in Central America\r\n(ONUCA) and followed in 1990 by the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission to Verify the Electoral Process in\r\nNicaragua (ONUVEN), both of which were in Nicaragua,\r\nand then by ONUSAL in El Salvador, I believe we can\r\nconfidently proclaim them to have been enormously\r\nsuccessful.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay high\r\ntribute to the peoples of El Salvador and Nicaragua, whose\r\nstrength of will and indomitable spirit made the ideals of\r\npeace and democracy a reality in their societies. Let me\r\nalso commend the various United Nations organs and\r\nagencies for their innovative and very effective efforts to\r\nfulfil their important mandates.\r\nIn an effort to build upon the success of peace-keeping\r\noperations following the completion of their mandates, the\r\nForeign Ministers of Japan and the Central American\r\ncountries agreed at the United Nations Headquarters this\r\nSeptember to establish a Japan-Central America forum to\r\npromote dialogue and cooperation on a range of issues in\r\npolitical, economic and cultural areas. Japan hopes that\r\nthe forum, to be convened once a year, will help it gain\r\na greater understanding of the real needs of the region so\r\nas to ensure that its cooperative efforts are as effective as\r\npossible.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, thanks to the enthusiasm of\r\nits people and the assistance of the United Nations, El\r\nSalvador has continued to make progress in building a\r\ndemocratic society, particularly since the successful\r\ngeneral election that was held there last year. This is not\r\nto say, however, that the implementation of the peace\r\nagreements has not been fraught with problems and\r\ndelays. We have yet to see, for example, the full\r\ndeployment of the National Civil Police and the complete\r\ndemobilization of the National Police. Nor has the\r\nredistribution of land among the former combatants been\r\nfinalized.\r\nIn this context, Japan strongly supports the efforts of\r\nthe Mission of the United Nations in El Salvador\r\n(MINUSAL), which, under the able leadership of Mr.\r\nEnrique ter Horst, commenced its work this past May to\r\nfollow up the international peace-keeping effort in\r\nEl Salvador. I should like to emphasize on this occasion\r\nthat the valiant people of El Salvador need and deserve\r\ncontinued assistance from the international community as\r\nthey rebuild their country. Japan, for one, is providing\r\never greater support for that effort. It does so in the\r\nconviction that through their unwavering commitment to\r\npeace and democratic principles, the people of El\r\nSalvador will demonstrate to the international community\r\nthat the concept of peace-building is in fact a viable one.\r\nThe vigilant attention and consistent efforts of the\r\ninternational community are required in other parts of the\r\nregion as well. I should like in particular to touch upon\r\nthe situation in Guatemala, which has seen the longest\r\nconflict in Central America’s history.\r\nNegotiations between the Government of Guatemala\r\nand the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca\r\n(URNG) are being conducted under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations. While progress in those talks has been\r\nuneven, we are encouraged by the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission for the Verification of Human\r\nRights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the\r\nComprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in\r\nGuatemala (MlNUGUA), and by the signing of the\r\nAgreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous People.\r\nThe presidential-election campaign is now entering its\r\nfinal stage. In just a few days, on Sunday, 12 November,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nthe election will finally be held. It will represent the\r\nculmination of patient and protracted efforts over the past\r\n30 years of all the parties concerned.\r\nIn view of the significance of this election, Japan has\r\ndecided to contribute a grant of $100,000 to the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) to be used for\r\nelection-monitoring purposes. It will also participate in\r\nmonitoring activities, coordinating its efforts with OAS. It\r\nis Japan’s earnest hope that this election will create an\r\natmosphere that will be conducive to further and speedy\r\nprogress in the negotiations so that a final peace agreement\r\nmay be concluded and ready for signing early in 1996.\r\nJapan highly commends the United Nations, and\r\nparticularly MINUGUA, as well as the members of the\r\nSecretary-General’s Group of Friends of the Guatemalan\r\nPeace Process, without whose efforts such progress would\r\nnot be possible.\r\nI would be less than candid if I did not acknowledge\r\nthe fact that numerous obstacles remain on the path to\r\npeace and democracy in Central America. But we must not\r\nbe discouraged. Rather, we should redouble our efforts to\r\novercome these problems by combining peace-keeping and\r\npeace-building activities in new and creative ways.\r\nIt is in this context that Japan is extending various\r\nkinds of medium- and long-term cooperation to the\r\ncountries of Central America, including yen loans, general\r\ngrant aid and technical assistance. It has also responded\r\npromptly and generously to the need for emergency relief\r\nin the wake of natural disasters that have occurred in the\r\nregion. Should any new emergency arise, Japan stands\r\nready to provide assistance, in the belief that its assistance\r\nnot only facilitates economic development and provides\r\nhumanitarian relief, but that it helps to advance the peace\r\nprocess and ensures that any progress will be irreversible.\r\nI wish to conclude my remarks today with a word of\r\ngratitude to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for\r\nthe indispensable role he has played in the struggle to\r\nrestore peace and stability throughout Central America. The\r\ncoordination of United Nations efforts with the initiatives\r\nof like-minded countries in the region has demonstrated\r\nnew ways in which peace-keeping and peace-building may\r\nbe effectively combined and has provided a model for\r\nfuture endeavours in this area. I should therefore like to\r\nurge the United Nations to continue to pursue its innovative\r\npeace-building activities in the region, for I believe that\r\nthrough its experiences in Central America it is gaining\r\nvaluable lessons for the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity in other parts of the world.\r\nMr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The Russian Federation notes with\r\nsatisfaction that after many years of armed conflict and\r\ninstability Central America is today at the stage of\r\nconsolidating the peace process, strengthening democratic\r\ninstitutions and economic revival. Despite considerable\r\ndifficulties, the process of national reconciliation and\r\ndemocratization in the Central American region is, on the\r\nwhole, proceeding successfully and has already led to a\r\nconsiderable relaxation of tension there.\r\nThe tangible progress achieved in Central America\r\nhas been made possible to a large extent by the efforts of\r\nthe international community and, first and foremost, by\r\nthose of the United Nations. We believe that the\r\npeacemaking experience gained in Central America\r\ndeserves careful study and that it should be applied in\r\nother parts of the world.\r\nThe Russian Federation takes a positive view of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations missions in El Salvador\r\nand Guatemala and supported the further extension of\r\ntheir mandates. We welcome the constructive cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS) and other regional organizations\r\non this question.\r\nThe Russian Federation is pleased and gratified by\r\nthe success of the peace process in El Salvador. The\r\nexperience of the 45-month multipurpose peace-keeping\r\noperation has shown that tolerance and perseverance in\r\nseeking paths to settlement and reaching agreements can\r\nsucceed in resolving the most complex and protracted\r\nconflicts — provided, of course, that the parties involved\r\ngenuinely desire to achieve a durable peace.\r\nWe note the generally constructive course of\r\nimplementation of the Chapultepec Peace Agreement,\r\nwhich has furthered the trend towards a logical\r\nstabilization of the situation in El Salvador. At the same\r\ntime, certain unresolved problems remain. The Russian\r\nFederation attaches great importance to the fact that a\r\ncomprehensive approach to post-conflict peace-building is\r\nnow required in El Salvador, with close cooperation\r\nbetween El Salvador and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), other United Nations specialized\r\nagencies and international financial institutions.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nNotwithstanding the remaining complexities and the\r\nrecurrent outbreaks of violence recently seen in Guatemala,\r\nthe signature by the Government and the leadership of the\r\nUnidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) of\r\na whole series of agreements has created a real basis for\r\nsuccess in achieving a peaceful settlement in the near future\r\nin that country. The most important requirements for further\r\nprogress are the strict compliance of both parties with the\r\nobligations they have already entered into and the taking of\r\ndecisive and effective steps to ensure the protection of\r\nhuman rights, and in particular the safety of the civilian\r\npopulation. We hope that on the basis of the agreements\r\nreached, and with mutual goodwill, the Government and the\r\nURNG will do everything possible to reach specific\r\nagreements shortly on the unresolved issues that remain. In\r\nthis connection we call upon both parties to complete the\r\nprocess of national reconciliation by signing the relevant\r\ndocuments during the term of the present administration —\r\nthat is, prior to January 1996.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the Government of\r\nNicaragua to consolidate civil peace and to improve the\r\nsocio-economic situation in the country. The resolution of\r\nthe recent political differences between the executive and\r\nlegislative authorities has demonstrated the country’s desire\r\nand ability to find solutions to the remaining problems. The\r\nimportant point now is to ensure that all necessary\r\nconditions are met for the general elections to be held in\r\nNicaragua in accordance with the time-table set out in the\r\nConstitution, which will further enhance the regular\r\nevolution of the democratization process.\r\nThe Russian Federation welcomes the positive impact\r\non the situation in Central America of the growing political\r\nand economic cooperation between the countries of the\r\nsubregion within the framework of the Central American\r\nIntegration System, and the new momentum given it by the\r\ndecision to meet in October of this year at Costa del Sol, El\r\nSalvador. The Russian Federation supported the proposal\r\nthat the Central American Integration System be granted\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly and was one of the\r\nsponsors of the resolution concerned.\r\nAt the same time, it should be noted that the\r\nstabilization process in the subregion is still proceeding at\r\nan uneven pace. Many of the social and economic problems\r\nthat were formerly the cause of conflicts remain to be\r\nsolved, and there is evidence of serious political difficulties\r\nand of deliberate resistance on the part of certain radical\r\ngroups. The world community must continue to afford\r\neffective assistance to the Central American countries in\r\naverting new outbreaks of tension, in ensuring that the\r\nprocesses of national reconciliation in the subregion are\r\nirreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State\r\nstructures, in strengthening the climate of political\r\ntolerance, in the strict observance of human rights, and in\r\ntheir economic recovery.\r\nThe Russian Federation has repeatedly put forward\r\ninitiatives designed to strengthen international support for\r\nthese processes in Central America. We have stated our\r\nreadiness to participate in the demining of former war\r\nzones being carried out in the Central American States\r\nunder the auspices of OAS. The Russian Federation is\r\nprepared to continue to provide assistance in the final\r\nsettlement of the problems of Central America and to\r\ncooperate actively to that end with the countries of the\r\nsubregion and with all interested extra-regional States. We\r\nalso favour the further strengthening of the United\r\nNations role in that peacemaking process.\r\nThe Russian delegation is grateful to the\r\nrepresentative of Nicaragua for having introduced the\r\ndraft resolution (A/50/L.17) under the agenda item\r\nentitled “The situation in Central America: procedures for\r\nthe establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress\r\nin fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment”, and we are prepared to consider it\r\nfavourably.\r\nMr. Laclaustra (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe European Union is following with great interest\r\nthe situation in Central America and is pleased with the\r\nprogress that that American region is making year by year\r\ntowards the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and\r\nin fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment, so that it can emerge as an example of\r\nharmony and integration for the rest of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe peace initiative of Esquipulas, advanced in\r\n1987, paved the way for mediation processes that made\r\nit possible to go about resolving the cruel armed conflicts\r\nthat devastated various countries of the region. The\r\nparticipation of the international community, through the\r\nsignificant presence of the United Nations and the useful\r\nwork of the mechanism of the Group of Friends, has\r\nfacilitated, and continues to facilitate, a positive outcome\r\nof the peace processes.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nWithin the framework of the region, the European\r\nUnion welcomes the positive evaluation, contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/50/499) of 3 October 1995,\r\nof the work of the Support Group for Nicaragua, in which\r\nthree members of the Union participate. Its task is to follow\r\nNicaragua’s transition and to support the process of internal\r\nconsensus-building, with a view to economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The elections of October 1996 will be a new\r\nand important stage in the consolidation of democracy and\r\nthe foundations of Nicaragua’s reconstruction.\r\nNotwithstanding the achievements made, important\r\nmeasures still need to be adopted in order to consolidate the\r\npeace processes in Guatemala and El Salvador.\r\nThe elections to be held next 12 November in\r\nGuatemala, with the participation of all the political forces\r\nand in the spirit of the recent Contadora Declaration, will\r\nenable the people of Guatemala to join in the movement of\r\npeace, democracy and development that Central America is\r\nexperiencing. States members of the European Union are\r\nsending observers to the elections, and those observers will\r\nwork in conjunction with the mission of the United Nations\r\nand the mission of the Organization of American States.\r\nIn the statement made by its Presidency on 12\r\nOctober, the European Union strongly condemned the tragic\r\nevents that took place on 5 October in the town of Chisec,\r\nDepartment of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, and demanded\r\nthat there be an immediate investigation and that those\r\nresponsible be punished. The European Union appreciates\r\nthe measures announced by the President of the Republic\r\nand is following very closely the investigation being carried\r\nout by the United Nations in respect of those events.\r\nThe European Union considers that full respect of the\r\npopulation’s human rights is essential for the participation\r\nof all the people of Guatemala in the elections and for the\r\nsuccess of the peace process. Particularly in the rural areas,\r\nthis means that the Voluntary Civil Defence Committees\r\nmust refrain from any action that might jeopardize the\r\nclimate of peace that is necessary for the successful holding\r\nof the elections.\r\nThe General Assembly recently extended the mandate\r\nof the United Nations Mission for the Verification of\r\nHuman Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments\r\nof the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA) for an additional period of six\r\nmonths, until 18 March 1996. The European Union\r\nconsiders that, thanks to the mediation efforts and the\r\npresence of MINUGUA on the ground, the United Nations\r\nis contributing actively and positively to the Guatemalan\r\npeace process, helping and encouraging the parties to\r\nreach a firm and lasting peace, through national\r\nreconciliation, thus making it possible to lay the\r\nfoundations of democracy and development in a climate\r\nof liberty and justice. The European Union urges both\r\nparties to comply with their commitments under the\r\nComprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and to\r\nimplement MINUGUA’s recommendations.\r\nJust a few days ago, on 31 October 1995, the\r\nGeneral Assembly took another important decision, also\r\nsupported by the European Union: it adopted the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to extend the mandate of the\r\nMission of the United Nations in El Salvador\r\n(MINUSAL) for six months. We welcome the cooperation\r\nbetween MINUSAL and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) in the consolidation of the Peace\r\nAccords, and we hope that it will be further strengthened\r\nduring the coming months. As the process proceeds, El\r\nSalvador will need to give more emphasis to its long-term\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe European Union considers this necessary not\r\nonly because of the important political message of\r\nencouragement this decision sends to El Salvador, but\r\nalso because we are concerned that some elements of the\r\nPeace Accords are not being fully implemented and others\r\nhave been considerably delayed. Swifter progress is\r\nneeded to avoid undermining the peace process and\r\ncausing political and social instability.\r\nEven though the overall degree of implementation of\r\nthe Peace Accords is satisfactory, the final\r\nimplementation of some very important aspects of the\r\nconsolidation of peace are still pending, such as the\r\nprogrammes of human settlements and land transfer, as\r\nare the reforms necessary in public security and the\r\ninstitutional development of the National Civil Police and\r\nthe National Public Security Academy, institutions to\r\nwhich the European Union is providing technical and\r\nfinancial assistance.\r\nAlso pending is the implementation of\r\nrecommendations of the Commission on the Truth and the\r\nJoint Group relating to reforms in the judicial system as\r\nwell as in the electoral field, the speedy implementation\r\nof which is essential so that they can be applicable in the\r\ncoming elections. This would give the democratic system\r\ngreater credibility.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nThe European Union has considered the report\r\n(A/50/499) of the Secretary-General of 3 October 1995 on\r\nthe situation in Central America. As Central America\r\nadvances towards the consolidation and reinforcement of its\r\ndemocratic institutions, the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council are proving to be appropriate\r\nforums for considering the evolution of the region. In this\r\nway the various cooperation and integration mechanisms\r\nhave an opportunity to prove their validity for the benefit\r\nof the peoples in the region.\r\nIn this context, we want to encourage the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue to coordinate and stimulate all United\r\nNations organs to assist, through the various ongoing\r\nprogrammes, in the economic and social development of\r\nCentral America and to support the important initiatives for\r\ngreater integration being promoted by the countries of the\r\nregion. In that connection, we take a positive view of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s recent granting of observer status to\r\nthe Central American Integration System.\r\nOf the many initiatives taken, we would like to\r\nunderline two that we consider particularly important and\r\nthat show a sincere will for Central American integration.\r\nFirst, we wish to note the efforts made by the Central\r\nAmerican countries with a view to a coherent strategy of\r\ndevelopment, which is given form in the Alliance for\r\nSustainable Development, with an emphasis on collective\r\nefforts to reduce poverty in the isthmus through social\r\nintegration, human development, investment in human\r\nresources and environmental protection.\r\nSecondly, in a region that has suffered years of\r\nmilitary tensions, the elaboration of an agreement on\r\nregional security issues is commendable. This is currently\r\nunder discussion, the aim being to define a security model\r\nthat would make use of democratic institutions to find\r\ncomprehensive and peaceful solutions to the problems of\r\nthe region. This initiative reflects important changes in the\r\narmed forces, significant changes that put us on the right\r\npath to defining a new model for regional defence that\r\nrespects human rights and strengthens the rule of law and\r\nthe comprehensive development of human beings and\r\nsociety.\r\nThe European Union wishes to reaffirm its\r\ndetermination to continue to support the Central American\r\nintegration process and the new efforts aimed at stimulating\r\nthe comprehensive development of the region.\r\nThe eleventh annual Ministerial Conference on\r\npolitical dialogue and economic cooperation between the\r\nEuropean Union and the States of the San José Group\r\nwas held in Panama City in February 1995. The\r\nparticipants in the Conference welcomed the progress\r\nmade in the peace process, in the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights and in the\r\ndevelopment and integration of the Central American\r\nregion. They also stressed the positive effect on the\r\nprocess of 10 years of exceptionally fruitful dialogue\r\nbetween the two regions.\r\nDuring the months leading up to the Conference, the\r\ntwo sides had a number of contacts and agreed on the\r\nnecessity to adapt the substance and format of the San\r\nJosé dialogue to the new circumstances created by the\r\nprofound changes of recent years, both in the European\r\nUnion and in Central America. The eleventh San José\r\nConference, representing a major step in that direction,\r\nwas devoted to three topics: sustainable development in\r\nCentral America, regional integration and the integration\r\nof Central America in the international economy and,\r\nfinally, the future of relations between Central America\r\nand the European Union.\r\nThe San José dialogue has proved to be a lively\r\nmechanism of exchange and mutual understanding\r\nbetween the European Union and the countries of Central\r\nAmerica. This dialogue, given the important changes in\r\nthe region, is serving to reorient and strengthen\r\ncooperation with Central America, which will enable us\r\nto face together with even greater vitality the challenges\r\nof the years to come. The areas we consider particularly\r\nimportant have to do with consolidating the rule of law,\r\nstrengthening democratic mechanisms, deepening social\r\nstabilization and harmoniously introducing the Central\r\nAmerican countries into the international economy. In this\r\ncontext, I would like to recall that the European Union\r\nand its member States as a whole constitute the primary\r\ndonor to the cause of cooperation in the region.\r\nThe European Union trusts that during this session\r\nof the General Assembly Central America will be able to\r\nsecure the ongoing peace processes in order to consolidate\r\nachievements in the quest for lasting peace, democracy\r\nand development, and in this endeavour it should enjoy\r\nthe assistance, solidarity and encouragement of the\r\ninternational community. The European Union will\r\ncontinue to play an active role in this effort.\r\nMr. Castelli (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation is pleased to speak on agenda\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nitem 45, entitled “The situation in Central America:\r\nprocedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace\r\nand progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development”, which is before the\r\nAssembly today.\r\nWe have studied the report of the Secretary-General\r\non this subject, contained in document A/50/499, and the\r\nthird report of the Director of the United Nations Mission\r\nfor the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance\r\nwith the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on\r\nHuman Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA), contained in\r\ndocument A/50/482.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s positive outlook,\r\nwhich is based on the prospect of the region’s being free of\r\narmed conflicts and effecting institutional changes capable\r\nof supporting new programmes of social and economic\r\nreforms that will make it possible to consolidate sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We also welcome the international\r\ncommunity’s support, as manifested in an active endeavour\r\nthat includes the United Nations system.\r\nWith regard to the latter report, we share the concern\r\nover the situation of Guatemala and, in accordance with the\r\ndeclaration of the most recent Ibero-American summit, we\r\nsupport the efforts of its Government and urge the parties\r\nto achieve a solid and lasting peace. My country wishes to\r\nreiterate its resolute policy of encouragement for the\r\nGuatemalan peace process, which has been aptly reflected\r\nin our co-sponsorship of resolution 48/267, establishing\r\nMINUGUA, and, more recently, of resolution 49/236 B,\r\nextending its mandate for six months.\r\nThe Central American region is not exempt from the\r\nglobal tendencies emerging since the end of the cold war.\r\nIt is striving for active regionalization and the consolidation\r\nof societies in which peace reigns, freedom is a reality,\r\ndemocracy is the norm and sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment are a real possibility. Its Governments are\r\naware that the search for these values will contribute to the\r\nconsolidation of a situation of well-being and stability in\r\nthe region.\r\nFor its part, the international community takes note\r\nthat the Central American region is overcoming a difficult\r\nperiod of internal conflict and entering a new era of\r\ninstitutional reconstruction and economic development. The\r\nconsolidation of this process calls for solidarity and\r\ncooperation, which can be fuelled by financial support, both\r\nmultilateral and bilateral. Only in this way will it be\r\npossible to give impetus to investment and, as a result,\r\ngrowth.\r\nIn the context of assistance, it would be particularly\r\ndesirable to pour in the economic and technical assistance\r\nthat will be required to face the difficult situations that\r\narmed conflicts always leave in their wake.\r\nMy country has given concrete proof of its clear\r\ncommitment to this philosophy, both in the peace\r\nprocesses and in initiatives such as the signing of\r\ntechnical-cooperation agreements in the areas of human\r\nresources, agriculture, forest management, fishing and\r\nenergy, as well as in the renegotiation of external debt —\r\nespecially public debt. In the conviction that recovery and\r\neconomic development are essential conditions for the\r\nconsolidation of peace and democracy in this region, my\r\ncountry has allotted for Central America 46 per cent of\r\nthe total amount for projects agreed upon through the\r\nArgentine fund for horizontal cooperation, making Central\r\nAmerica the fund’s principal beneficiary worldwide.\r\nWe have made concrete contributions to both\r\nmilitary and civilian participation in the peace-keeping\r\noperations deployed in the region, as well as in the areas\r\nof human rights and electoral assistance.\r\nIn this spirit, we wish to renew our commitment to\r\nthe Central American region, whose peoples are such\r\nclose kin of our own.\r\nMr. Fowler (Canada): Canada values highly the\r\nwork of the United Nations in assisting the peoples and\r\nGovernments of Central America in achieving democracy\r\nand development. The respect in which the Organization\r\nis held in Central America has allowed it to assist the\r\nGovernments and peoples of Central America to achieve\r\nimportant objectives. Over the last 10 years Canada has\r\nsupported all of the United Nations initiatives, usually in\r\ndirect and material ways. We have contributed military\r\nand police personnel to the United Nations Observer\r\nGroup in Central America (ONUCA), the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and the\r\nUnited Nations Mission for the Verification of Human\r\nRights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the\r\nComprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA). Today, I should like to\r\ncomment briefly on the Central American peace process,\r\nparticularly those aspects raised by the Secretary-General\r\nin his recent reports under agenda item 45.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nWe recognize the important progress that has been\r\nmade in the implementation of the El Salvador peace\r\naccords with the assistance of ONUSAL and, since May of\r\nthis year, of the Mission of the United Nations in El\r\nSalvador (MINUSAL). The Secretary-General recently\r\nadvised us that there was still important work for\r\nMINUSAL to do in the verification of the implementation\r\nof the remaining commitments. On this basis, Canada co-\r\nsponsored resolution A/50/7, approving its intention to\r\nextend MINUSAL for a further six months. We believe,\r\nhowever, that MINUSAL must not be extended indefinitely,\r\nand we encourage the Government of El Salvador to\r\nredouble its efforts to ensure the prompt, transparent and\r\nthorough implementation of its commitments under the\r\npeace accords.\r\nDuring the last two years, Canada has participated in\r\nthe Nicaragua Support Group. We think that this new and\r\nvery low-cost form of preventive diplomacy has been useful\r\nin assisting the Government and people of Nicaragua in\r\nconducting a dialogue on critical economic and political\r\nissues.\r\nCanada is encouraged by the achievements to date in\r\nthe Guatemala peace process, but we remain concerned by\r\nthe slow rate of progress towards a final peace accord. We\r\nurge the parties involved in the peace negotiations under the\r\nmediation of the United Nations to maintain their\r\ncommitment and their efforts to advance the process. This\r\nwill require sufficient flexibility on both sides. It is\r\nsignificant that Guatemala’s major political parties have\r\nindicated their willingness to implement the accords already\r\nsigned and to continue the process.\r\nWe have read carefully the three reports of the\r\nDirector of the United Nations Mission for the Verification\r\nof Human Rights in Guatemala on the human rights\r\nsituation in that country. The positive steps and attitudes\r\nreported in the second report were important and\r\nencouraging for the peace process in Guatemala. On the\r\nother hand, the situation reported in MINUGUA’s third\r\nreport and the subsequent massacre at Xaman, in Alta\r\nVerapaz, give rise to renewed concern. We urge the\r\nGovernment of Guatemala and other concerned parties to\r\nconsider seriously the recommendations of MINUGUA and\r\nto work hard to give them effect, particularly with regard\r\nto the problem of impunity. For its part, Canada will\r\ncontinue to support MINUGUA and the peace negotiations.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOne of the most encouraging developments in\r\nCentral America is the continuing trend towards political\r\nand institutional cooperation and economic integration\r\nreported to us by the Secretary-General. One of the fruits\r\nof this process, the Alliance for Sustainable Development,\r\ncan serve Central Americans as an effective tool in their\r\npursuit of economic and social development and of\r\nintegration with the global economy. During his meeting\r\nwith the Central American leaders in San José in January\r\n1995, Prime Minister Chrétien demonstrated his support\r\nfor the Alliance and other Central American initiatives\r\ntowards regional cooperation. He has expressed a strong\r\ninterest in maintaining high-level consultations on this\r\nissue.\r\nIn the end, the fate of the peace process in Central\r\nAmerica lies in the hands of the peoples and\r\nGovernments of that region. Their achievements and their\r\ncommitment to peace and to sustainable development are\r\nmost impressive, but much remains to be done.\r\nI should like to conclude by paying tribute to the\r\nefforts towards peace and development in Central\r\nAmerica of the Secretary-General and the entire United\r\nNations system. The successes that have been achieved in\r\nCentral America during the last year owe a great deal to\r\nthe persistence and hard work of the United Nations.\r\nCanada stands ready to cooperate with the Central\r\nAmerican countries and the United Nations in achieving\r\npeace and development in this region.\r\nMr. Biørn Lian (Norway): The situation in Central\r\nAmerica has during the last decade changed from conflict\r\nand mistrust to democratization and cooperation. There\r\nis reason to congratulate the Central Americans on their\r\naccomplishments, but at the same time it remains clear\r\nthat the challenges these countries face are still\r\nformidable. It is therefore paramount that they persevere\r\nin their efforts towards further normalization,\r\nreconstruction and reconciliation. In these endeavours,\r\nthey can count on the continued support and solidarity of\r\nthe international community.\r\nTogether with the other members of the group of\r\nfriends, Norway has been actively encouraging the peace\r\nprocess in Guatemala over the past few years. A final\r\npeace agreement has not yet been reached, but it is\r\nappropriate to pay tribute to the Secretary-General\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali and to the moderator Jean Arnault\r\nfor their untiring efforts to put an end to an armed\r\nconflict which has been exacting its toll from the people\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nof Guatemala for more than 35 years. Several significant\r\npartial agreements have been signed since the United\r\nNations gave a new impetus to the negotiations at the\r\nbeginning of last year, and at this very moment the\r\nGovernment Peace Commission and the Unidad\r\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) are meeting\r\nin Mexico trying to settle the important item of the\r\nsocio-economic aspects and the agrarian situation.\r\nHopefully it will be possible to conclude this partial\r\nagreement before the inauguration of the new president in\r\nJanuary next year.\r\nWhile the parties to the conflict meet for a new round\r\nof negotiations in Mexico, Guatemala is preparing for\r\nelections which hopefully will strengthen the country’s\r\ndemocratic institutions. Sectors that traditionally have not\r\ntaken an active part in the electoral process have on this\r\noccasion opted for a more positive approach. The electorate\r\nhas a wider choice of political alternatives, and the URNG\r\nhas been encouraging the Guatemalans to take advantage of\r\ntheir right to vote. Their unilateral cease-fire in the two\r\nweeks prior to the elections has also been a very\r\nconstructive measure. It is extremely important that the new\r\npresident and the major political parties in the new national\r\nassembly feel a commitment to the peace process. The\r\nContadora Declaration of August augurs well in that\r\nrespect, but the victors should be invited to reassure their\r\nfellow countrymen and the international community about\r\ntheir favourable attitude after the elections also.\r\nThe establishment and deployment of the United\r\nNations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights\r\n(MINUGUA) represents a significant step forward in the\r\npeace process. The presence of MINUGUA has given\r\nrenewed hope to the civilian population that peace, justice,\r\nreconstruction and reconciliation may become a reality in\r\nGuatemala, but the mission can be a success only if the\r\nauthorities act sincerely and wholeheartedly on the\r\nMINUGUA recommendations.\r\nNorway, for its part, has stepped up considerably its\r\nassistance to Guatemala over the past two years, with a\r\nprojected total in 1995 of roughly $11 million, which is\r\nslightly higher than last year. A contribution to MINUGUA\r\nof $1 million is especially aimed at reforms in the judicial\r\nsystem and translation to Mayan languages and distribution\r\nof the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous\r\nPeoples. Special priority continues to be given to projects\r\nrelated to democratization and political development and to\r\nparticularly vulnerable groups, with special emphasis on the\r\nindigenous population. Norway has also made a point of\r\nestablishing good contacts with all relevant actors in the\r\nsocial and political landscape of Guatemala and we have\r\nmade clear to the negotiating parties that we are prepared\r\nto contribute further to specific peace-related needs that\r\nmay arise during the negotiating process.\r\nThe Government Peace Commission and the URNG\r\nnow seem to have a realistic approach to the peace\r\nnegotiations. It is imperative that the various sectors of\r\nGuatemalan society display the same constructive spirit,\r\nincluding those that may have to renounce some of their\r\nprivileges in order to create a better tomorrow for all\r\nGuatemalans. Peace is a necessary first step before the\r\nentire people of Guatemala can join efforts in this noble\r\nventure. Massive participation in the elections on Sunday\r\nwould be encouraging testimony to the fact that the\r\nGuatemalans, through peaceful and democratic means, are\r\nready to take their destiny in their own hands. And the\r\nUnited Nations and the Group of Friends will continue to\r\nbe the firmest allies of a Guatemala that is staking its\r\nfuture on peace and reconciliation.\r\nThe signature of the Chapultepec Peace Agreement\r\nin El Salvador in 1993 initiated a fruitful process of\r\npeace-building in that country to which the United\r\nNations has contributed substantially. For Norway, it has\r\nbeen natural to participate in and contribute to the United\r\nNations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and\r\nthe Mission of the United Nations in El Salvador\r\n(MINUSAL) as well as in the training of the new\r\nNational Civil Police of El Salvador.\r\nImportant parts of the Chapultepec Agreement are,\r\nhowever, still not fully accomplished. This is notably the\r\ncase for such matters as the distribution of land and\r\njudicial and electoral reforms. We therefore hope that the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador will take the necessary\r\nmeasures to assure the implementation of the Peace\r\nAgreement in letter as well as in spirit.\r\nIn its evaluation of the public security sector,\r\nMINUSAL is reporting a number of problems in the new\r\nNational Civil Police as well as in the Police Academy.\r\nWe believe that a well-organized, independent police\r\nforce that respects human rights is fundamental for the\r\nfurther consolidation of the peace process in EL Salvador.\r\nThe recommendations and time limits given by\r\nMINUSAL in its report should be complied with by the\r\nSalvadoran authorities.\r\nThe conflict between the Nicaraguan Government\r\nand the National Assembly seemed to have been resolved\r\nin June this year. The cooperation between the two\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nnational institutions can, however, still be improved.\r\nNorway would like to see greater stress being laid on the\r\nimportance of political dialogue to avoid future\r\nconstitutional crises, and we urge the parties to resolve the\r\nremaining problems. Economic and social development is\r\nonly possible when the political situation is stable, and such\r\nstability is the common responsibility of all political parties\r\nand institutions in Nicaragua.\r\nFree and democratic elections in 1996 will signify a\r\nworthy end to the first transition period after the civil war.\r\nNorway hopes that elections will be held as programmed in\r\nOctober next year so that a new President and a new\r\nGovernment can initiate the second stage of the democratic\r\ntransition in January 1997.\r\nNicaragua has managed to reduce substantially its\r\ncommercial foreign debt and bilateral debt. Hopefully, this\r\nlessening of the debt burden will improve the economic\r\nsituation of the country. Nicaragua will, however, still need\r\nsupport from the international community to be able to\r\ndevelop further. Nicaragua is Norway’s only programme\r\ncountry in Latin America, and is the most important\r\nrecipient of Norwegian development assistance on the\r\ncontinent. Bilateral assistance will amount to approximately\r\n$27 million in 1995. We are prepared to maintain the\r\nassistance to Nicaragua, but would like to emphasize that\r\ninternational assistance can only be a supplement to\r\nnational efforts to assure continued positive social and\r\neconomic progress in the country.\r\nMr. Laing (Belize): In the same way as the Belize\r\ndelegation did last year, as a good neighbour we must lend\r\nour full support to draft resolution A/50/L.17 on the\r\nsituation in Central America. We are happy to observe that\r\nduring the past 12 months our delicate, filigreed isthmus\r\nhas remained largely stable. In no small measure, this is\r\ndue to the strenuous efforts of persons of good will in\r\nCentral America as well as to the labours of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of this Organization.\r\nWe are grateful, too, that the flood of displaced\r\npersons crossing the subregion’s borders for safety and\r\ngreater prosperity from some areas has been stemmed.\r\nRegrettably, from some other areas the tide continues, with\r\nserious effects on host countries, including mine.\r\nYet, overall, we are quite optimistic at the rate of\r\nprogress in the subregion. Belize continues to participate in\r\nsome of the efforts of cooperation in the region, especially\r\nvicariously through the development administration of\r\nBelize by the Central American offices of some United\r\nNations agencies and through participation in the\r\n“San José Process”, which has now happily resumed for\r\nBelize. We are also enthusiastic participants in the\r\nAlliance for Sustainable Development.\r\nHowever, regrettably, the documentation sometimes\r\ndoes not adequately reflect the fact of our active\r\ninvolvement. I refer to aspects of document A/50/L.17\r\nand of A/50/499.\r\nWe are convinced, however, that in due course\r\nBelize will take its rightful place as the bridge between\r\nthe isthmus and the wider Caribbean spaces now\r\nepitomized by the Association of Caribbean States. We\r\nsuggest that Central America’s economic future and social\r\nupliftment will be enhanced by harnessing the region’s\r\ncompetitive advantages in the globalization process.\r\nBelize’s stable political order and institutions, and its\r\nofficial language, are assets in this regard. We pledge to\r\nput them to the full use of the isthmus and of the wider\r\nCaribbean.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nI should like to inform members that in order to\r\nallow the Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee to review\r\nthe programme budget implications of draft resolution\r\nA/50/L.17, action on the draft resolution will be taken at\r\na later date to be announced in the Journal.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President: I should like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning agenda item 20, “Strengthening\r\nof the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special\r\neconomic assistance”.\r\nI have requested His Excellency Mr. Ernst Sucharipa\r\nof Austria, who ably coordinated the informal\r\nconsultations on draft resolutions under this item during\r\nthe forty-ninth session, to assist me in the same capacity\r\nthis session, and he has graciously accepted. May I\r\nrequest those delegations intending to submit draft\r\nresolutions under agenda item 20 to do so as early as\r\npossible in order to allow time, if need be, for\r\nnegotiations, with a view to reaching consensus on the\r\ndraft resolutions.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 9 November 1995\r\nIn this connection, I should like to inform Members\r\nthat the first meeting of the informal consultations on this\r\nitem will be held on 14 November, as will be announced\r\nin the Journal.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.\r\n14\r\n"
