(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nThird report of the General Committee\r\n(A/50/250/Add.2)\r\nThe President: This morning, I draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives first to the third report of the General\r\nCommittee concerning a request by the delegation of the\r\nPhilippines for the inclusion in the agenda of an additional\r\nsub-item under agenda item 95, “Sustainable development\r\nand international economic cooperation”, and a request by\r\nthe Secretary-General for the inclusion of an additional sub-\r\nitem under agenda item 17, “Appointments to fill vacancies\r\nin subsidiary organs and other appointments”.\r\nIn paragraph 1 of the report, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that the sub-item entitled\r\n“Food and sustainable agricultural development” should be\r\nincluded in the agenda of the current session as a sub-item\r\nof agenda item 95, “Sustainable development and\r\ninternational economic cooperation”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\ninclude this additional sub-item in the agenda of the current\r\nsession?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee further\r\ndecided to recommend to the Assembly that the additional\r\nsub-item be allocated to the Second Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\nallocate the additional sub-item to the Second Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The Chairman of the Second\r\nCommittee will be informed of the decision just taken.\r\nIn paragraph 2 of the report, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that an additional sub-item\r\nentitled “Appointment of a member of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit” should be included as a sub-item of\r\nagenda item 17, “Appointments to fill vacancies in\r\nsubsidiary organs and other appointments”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\ninclude this additional sub-item in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee further\r\ndecided to recommend to the Assembly that the additional\r\nsub-item be considered directly in plenary meeting.\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\nconsider this item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 33\r\nInternational assistance for the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of Nicaragua: aftermath of the war and\r\nnatural disasters\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/50/535)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.18)\r\nThe President: I call on the Deputy Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Nicaragua, His Excellency Mr. Jose\r\nBernard Pallais, to introduce draft resolution A/50/L.18.\r\nMr. Pallais (Nicaragua) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOn 17 November 1994 the General Assembly approved\r\nwithout a vote resolution 49/16, “International assistance for\r\nthe rehabilitation and reconstruction of Nicaragua: aftermath\r\nof the war and natural disasters”, thereby reiterating the will\r\nof the international community to continue supporting\r\nNicaragua’s efforts at rehabilitation, reconstruction,\r\nstabilization and national development.\r\nWe would like to thank the international community,\r\nthe Support Group for Nicaragua and Secretary-General\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali for their valuable contribution to the\r\ndemocratization process and the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of our country.\r\nWe received with satisfaction document A/50/535,\r\ndated 10 October 1995, containing the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport pursuant to resolution 49/16 of the General Assembly\r\non the item before the Assembly. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport presents, in broad terms, the evolution of the\r\nNicaraguan situation. His comments merit all our attention\r\nand commit us, as a Government, to make greater efforts to\r\npromote the improvement of the social life of our country\r\nin all areas.\r\nIn 1990 President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro’s\r\nGovernment initiated the country’s integral transition from\r\nauthoritarianism to participatory democracy, from a\r\ncentralized economy to a market economy, from poverty to\r\ndevelopment, from confrontation to social rapprochement,\r\nand from war to peace.\r\nFive years later the country is gathering, with the\r\ntensions inherent in this difficult transition, the fruits of\r\nthe end of armed conflict, of national reconciliation and\r\nof macroeconomic stability.\r\nViolence with a political motive has not occurred in\r\nany significant way since 1993, according to the fourth\r\nreport of the Tripartite Commission established by the\r\nPresident of the Republic on 2 October 1992 for the study\r\nand analysis of post-war violence in Nicaragua with the\r\nparticipation of the Government, the Catholic Church and\r\nthe International Support and Verification Commission of\r\nthe Organization of American States. The report was\r\nmade public on 12 September last.\r\nThe application of preventive measures of economic\r\nand social support to demobilized members of the former\r\nNicaraguan resistance and the Nicaraguan Army, in\r\naddition to action to maintain civil security, were a\r\ndecisive influence in the creation of a climate of peace\r\nand work in rural areas in our country.\r\nPost-war violence is today a residual phenomenon on\r\nthe way to extinction. The principal challenge that we\r\nface is to sustain the gains made and to promote, as\r\nwidely and deeply as possible, a spirit of national\r\nsolidarity that will allow us to successfully tackle extreme\r\npoverty and the risk of social breakdown that it generates.\r\nWe have actively undertaken to develop educational\r\nprogrammes on human rights; the establishment of a\r\nnetwork of human rights promoters shows that civil\r\nsociety has embraced this desire for reconciliation.\r\nThe Government of Nicaragua, prompted by the\r\nvocation of peace of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), has\r\nrequested that organization’s support for its programme\r\nfor a culture of peace, based on the universal values of\r\nrespect for life, liberty, justice, solidarity and tolerance.\r\nWe are certain that UNESCO’s resolute support will be\r\nimmensely beneficial to Nicaraguan society.\r\nDialogue and national understanding have become\r\nregular choices for the solution of the country’s problems\r\nin every sphere. The representative and participatory\r\ndemocratic model has been enriched, contributing to\r\novercoming substantial political and social tensions\r\ncharacteristic of the establishment of a state of law and\r\nthe perfecting of democratic institutions, through\r\neconomic and social harmonization and the constant\r\nsearch for a political consensus.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nOn 4 July 1995, as the culmination of a long period of\r\nnational debate between the executive and legislative organs\r\nof the Government, the political parties and civil society,\r\nthe reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution\r\nwere published through the promulgation of a framework\r\nlaw which for the first time in our history establishes the\r\nmechanisms for a real commitment to democratic\r\ngovernability.\r\nLikewise, on 21 February 1995, the first transfer of\r\ncommand of the Nicaraguan Army to a military commander\r\nappointed by a civil authority took place — an historic\r\nevent that confirmed the process of institutionalization and\r\nmodernization of the armed forces of Nicaragua and their\r\nfull subordination to a democratic Government.\r\nFurthermore, on 5 July of this year the Conference on\r\nProperty co-sponsored by the Carter Center and the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) was held. The\r\ncomplex issue of the problem of property has given rise to\r\npassionate public debates and continues to constitute a\r\nparticular difficulty that requires urgent solution, since it\r\naffects very sensitive areas of economic, social and\r\ninstitutional development in Nicaragua.\r\nThe processes that have been observed during the past\r\nfew months point to an equitable solution for all sectors\r\nwith an interest in the property question. The National\r\nAssembly has begun to debate a property bill that, on the\r\nbasis of a broad consensus, once passed, would constitute\r\na viable solution to this very delicate matter, confirming\r\nsocial reform, correcting abuses and allowing for fair\r\ncompensation for those affected.\r\nBecause of our own special circumstances, and despite\r\nthe progress made in the transition, Nicaragua has not been\r\nable to progress as rapidly as we would wish in all\r\ndirections. Macroeconomic and social objectives are\r\ndependent on ample and sustained financing and external\r\ncooperation in the medium and long term.\r\nThe country’s foreign debt continues to be an\r\nexcessive burden on any equitable development programme.\r\nWhile measures have been taken to cushion the impact of\r\nthe measures of structural adjustment that have been\r\napplied, it is the most vulnerable sectors of the population\r\n— women, children, the elderly and the handicapped\r\n— that have borne the brunt of the necessary restrictions.\r\nThis increases social tensions; on some occasions, it leads\r\nto demands by the affected sectors for better services in the\r\nareas of education, health care, food and employment.\r\nThe renegotiation of Nicaragua’s debt has relied on\r\nthe understanding of the international community, which\r\nhas undertaken to continue its assistance in the\r\nexceptional conditions in which we are still living. Most\r\ncreditor nations have agreed to substantial reductions in\r\nthe debt burden. The Government has made considerable\r\nprogress in negotiations on the commercial debt, which\r\ntotals $1,700 million. At present, 79 per cent of the debt\r\nholders have so far accepted Nicaragua’s buy-back offer\r\nwith the support of the international financial\r\norganizations and a group of friendly countries. The\r\nConsultative Group for Nicaragua, meeting in Paris in\r\nJune of this year, confirmed its support for the transition\r\nprocess with promises of contributions for 1995-1997,\r\nwith the objective of reducing the deficit in the balance of\r\npayments over the next three years. However, the country\r\nneeds to renegotiate the remaining debt with flexible\r\ncriteria and substantive reductions.\r\nThe experience of our integral transition, to which I\r\nreferred at the beginning of my statement, is an example\r\nof the fact that the consolidation of peace after a conflict\r\nshould be linked to global development efforts.\r\nNatural disasters continue to befall our country. This\r\nseason’s tropical depressions have caused levels of rain\r\nthat have resulted in flooding in nearly all of the national\r\nterritory. This has endangered the life of entire\r\ncommunities and has destroyed basic grain crops, such as\r\ncorn and beans — the basic diet of the majority of the\r\npopulation. It has also caused deterioration of the main\r\nmeans of communication.\r\nTo this already critical situation has been added the\r\nbreakout of an epidemic of a type of hemorrhagic fever\r\nthat has already taken many human lives and is\r\nendangering the health of hundreds of people in the\r\nwestern part of our country and in other central\r\ndepartments.\r\nThese circumstances obviously undermine the efforts\r\nthe country has undertaken to overcome the consequences\r\nof the war within a framework of democracy and\r\nmacroeconomic stabilization. For this reason, Nicaragua\r\ncontinues to need the international community’s\r\nunderstanding and support.\r\nWe have the satisfaction of knowing that pacification\r\nin the country and the economic measures applied over\r\nthe past few years have put Nicaragua on the road to\r\nsustainable development, that there have been more-than-\r\nsignificant gains in building lasting democratic\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\ninstitutions, that the modernization of the State means\r\ngreater transparency in the management of public matters\r\nand better conditions for practising good government, that,\r\nwith the scarce resources available to us, the population is\r\nbenefiting in some spheres. This certainly constitutes\r\nprogress. But we are also certain that the problems and the\r\ndifficulties, due to their size and complexity, will subsist in\r\nthe coming years. We cannot think of going back; rather,\r\nwe must move forward.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report points out that\r\n“the main threat to democratic governance lies not in\r\npolitical conflict, but in the difficulty of the conditions\r\nof life and the subsequent loss of faith in democracy\r\nand its institutions”. (A/50/535, para 13)\r\nThis potential threat must be overcome by wisdom, political\r\nintelligence, a united national effort and international\r\ncooperation.\r\nDedication to productive work that could substantially\r\nraise the standard of living of Nicaraguans and achieve the\r\ngreat national objectives is not limited to the term of office\r\nof a particular Government. In 1996 general elections will\r\nbe held, and the country is preparing for a new stage, in\r\nwhich, for the first time, a democratically elected, civilian\r\nPresident will hand over power to another civilian elected\r\nin a process as open and honest as that of 1990. The new\r\nauthorities must continue to promote national development,\r\nwith the participation of all the sectors, a sense of social\r\njustice, reconciliation and adherence to the law and the\r\nvision of a better future for all Nicaraguans. With this, we\r\nwill be successfully completing the first stage of the\r\ndemocratic transition in Nicaragua.\r\nWe have already made a request to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations observe the 1996 electoral\r\nprocess. We are also calling upon the international\r\ncommunity to lend its political and financial support to this\r\nprocess, so that it will end successfully in democracy and\r\npeace.\r\nToday, on behalf of the co-sponsors, I wish to present\r\nfor consideration by Members of the Assembly, draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.18, entitled “International assistance for\r\nthe rehabilitation and reconstruction of Nicaragua: aftermath\r\nof the war and natural disasters”. This draft resolution is\r\nsimilar in content to resolution 49/16, adopted by the\r\nAssembly on 17 November 1994. It has simply been\r\nbrought up to date in the light of the events and\r\ncircumstances of our transition. I urge that this draft\r\nresolution be adopted unanimously.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to state that Nicaragua\r\ngratefully acknowledges the ample and effective response\r\nof the United Nations system and of the international\r\ncommunity in mobilizing resources necessary to our\r\ninstitutional, economic and social development. That\r\ncontribution consolidates the advances made in the\r\ndemocratic arena and makes a life of freedom the path to\r\njustice and peace for all Nicaraguans.\r\nMr. Maruyama (Japan) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): For four years now, the General Assembly has\r\ntaken up the important subject of international assistance\r\nfor the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Nicaragua.\r\nDuring that time, the Government of Nicaragua has made\r\nsubstantial progress, under extremely difficult\r\ncircumstances, in the areas of national reconciliation,\r\nmacroeconomic stabilization, consolidation of democracy\r\nand reorganization of civil society.\r\nIn the political field, we have witnessed the process\r\nof transition strengthened through the demobilization of\r\nmore than 20,000 members of the Nicaraguan Resistance,\r\nwhich today participates in the national debate as a\r\npolitical party. Each step taken towards the consolidation\r\nof civilian control over the military is one more step\r\ntowards justice and democratic freedom. Nicaragua is,\r\ntherefore, to be commended for reducing the National\r\nArmy from 98,000 to 15,700, rendering it today the\r\nsmallest in Central America. The country now enjoys a\r\nlevel of political freedom and democracy greater than at\r\nany moment in its history, an achievement highlighted by\r\nthe promulgation of the constitutional reforms by\r\nPresident de Chamorro on 4 July this year. It is, therefore,\r\nour sincere hope that the elections scheduled to be held in\r\nOctober next year under the newly reformed Constitution\r\nwill be conducted in a democratic and fair manner. In the\r\neconomic field, the framework of a market economy\r\nhaving been put in place, the country now enjoys much\r\nlower inflation and the highest economic growth rate in\r\n15 years.\r\nIt is only through strenuous effort and unshakable\r\ndetermination that the Government and people of\r\nNicaragua have been able to make this progress, and, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation and the Government of Japan, I\r\nwish to take this opportunity to once again, pledge our\r\ncontinued support.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nIn accordance with its principles of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, Japan has substantially increased its\r\nassistance to Nicaragua in recent years, with a view to\r\nsupporting its efforts to achieve democratization and\r\neconomic reform. That assistance has been directed in\r\nparticular to improving the balance of payments, meeting\r\nbasic human needs and promoting human-resources\r\ndevelopment. Japanese official aid to Nicaragua, including\r\nyen loans, grants and technical cooperation, totalled $207.7\r\nmillion for the period 1990 to 1994.\r\nAt the end of last year, a high-level Japanese mission\r\nfor economic and technical cooperation visited Nicaragua,\r\nand as a result of the subsequent agreement Japan now\r\nintends to provide Nicaragua with economic and technical\r\nassistance, with particular emphasis on activities in such\r\nareas as social development, eradicating poverty, improving\r\nsocio-economic infrastructure, conserving the environment,\r\npromoting the democratization process and enhancing\r\neconomic stability.\r\nAlthough, as I have already said, the Government of\r\nNicaragua, headed by President Chamorro, has made\r\nsubstantial achievements, it continues to face serious\r\ndifficulties as it strives for economic recovery,\r\nmacroeconomic stabilization and improvements in\r\ninfrastructure and in efforts to eliminate poverty. I believe\r\nthe Government and the people of Nicaragua need and\r\ndeserve the continuing assistance of donor countries and the\r\ninternational community as a whole as they pursue the full\r\nattainment of those objectives. For its part, the Government\r\nof Japan will do its utmost to ensure that Nicaragua is\r\nsuccessful in its struggle to achieve a better life for its\r\npeople.\r\nMr. Ferrarin (Italy): Italy wishes to express its\r\nappreciation for the Secretary-General’s report (A/50/535)\r\nentitled “International assistance for the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of Nicaragua: aftermath of the war and\r\nnatural disasters”.\r\nSince the end of the civil war, the people and the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua have made great efforts to\r\nrebuild civil society and to move the country towards a\r\npeaceful life and economic and social prosperity.\r\nThe transition process was a challenge for the\r\nGovernment of National Reconciliation: it was necessary to\r\nre-establish democracy and respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, foster a market economy and\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nWe are very pleased to note that Nicaragua has\r\nmade important achievements in this process. Pacification\r\nappears to have been consolidated, and the economic\r\npolicies for stabilization are producing solid results in the\r\ninflation rate and economic growth.\r\nAllow me to mention that Italy has also decided to\r\nmanifest once again its friendship and solidarity with the\r\nGovernment and the people of Nicaragua, with whom we\r\nshare strong Latin ties, by granting a unilateral debt\r\nreduction in addition to the one agreed to by the Paris\r\nClub in March 1995.\r\nMy country contributed very actively and\r\nsignificantly to the peace process in Central America and\r\nNicaragua through $115 million in funding for, and the\r\nimplementation of, the Development Programme for\r\nDisplaced Persons, Refugees and Returnees (PRODERE).\r\nThrough PRODERE Italy contributed to the resettlement\r\nof 350,000 displaced persons and refugees in Nicaragua.\r\nPRODERE completed its activities in June 1995, but the\r\nsustainability of the programme, as stressed in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, has been assured through its\r\ntransfer to local development agencies.\r\nLet me recall that the external evaluation mission,\r\nled by Nobel laureate Oscar Arias, has proved that\r\nPRODERE improved the situation regarding the basic\r\nmaterial needs of the affected population and restored\r\ncivil society’s faith in its rights and its role in the\r\ndecision-making process.\r\nEven since the end of PRODERE’s operations, the\r\nItalian involvement in Central America has not come to\r\nan end. Continuing its assistance in Nicaragua’s efforts\r\nfor development, Italy recently decided to finance and\r\nimplement, through the United Nations Office for Project\r\nServices (UNOPS), a project costing $1.8 million to\r\nimprove local health facilities in Nueva Segovia and\r\nJinotega for women, children and vulnerable sectors of\r\nsociety.\r\nIn order to alleviate the population’s suffering\r\ncaused by the drought, last January Italy also approved a\r\nfood-aid contribution of $1.3 million to Nicaragua.\r\nIn conclusion, Italy wishes to take this opportunity\r\nto confirm once again its unwavering political support for\r\nNicaragua through bilateral and multilateral channels.\r\nMr. Albín (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI wish first to thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\n(A/50/535) entitled “International assistance for the\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of Nicaragua: aftermath of\r\nthe war and natural disasters”. The report describes the\r\nactivities carried out by the United Nations system to help\r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nCentral America’s enormous efforts of recent years\r\nhave demonstrated the region’s indomitable will to leave\r\nbehind the years of violence and political, economic and\r\nsocial instability. The support of the entire international\r\ncommunity has been required in this difficult stage.\r\nNicaragua has gone through an intensive political\r\nprocess aimed at national reconciliation, pacification,\r\nreducing the size of the army and demobilizing the\r\nresistance. Recognizing the difficulty and importance of\r\nthese efforts, we wish to reiterate our will to continue to\r\ncooperate with Nicaragua in order to move ahead on the\r\nroad of peace and economic and social development.\r\nAs we have said on various occasions, peace is an\r\nintegral progress that includes both the absence of war and\r\nthe eradication of its underlying causes, which arise out of\r\nsocial inequalities and a lack of development.\r\nMy delegation notes with great satisfaction the\r\nsignificant progress made in the Nicaraguan peace process.\r\nAccording to the Secretary-General’s report this year,\r\n“for the first time there are no politically motivated\r\narmed groups in Nicaragua”. (A/50/535, para. 6)\r\nAlso,\r\n“More than 20,000 members of the Nicaraguan\r\nResistance have been demobilized and the army has\r\nbeen reduced from 92,000 combatants to 12,500, the\r\nsmallest in Central America”. (ibid.)\r\nDespite the relatively positive macroeconomic\r\nindicators, as the report mentions, Nicaragua’s economic\r\nand social situation is still fragile. The growth in gross\r\ndomestic product in 1994 did not translate into an\r\nimprovement in per capita income because of population\r\ngrowth of 3.7 per cent, the highest in the American\r\ncontinent. Since 1990, per capita income has declined by\r\nsome 10 per cent, and the unemployment rate in 1995 is\r\nrunning at 20.2 per cent of the economically active\r\npopulation, with underemployment at 33.7 per cent.\r\nThis situation shows that there are still major issues\r\noutstanding that deserve resolute and continued support\r\nfrom the international community.\r\nMexico, despite an adverse financial climate, has\r\nkept up its level of development assistance to Nicaragua.\r\nTo mention just some sectors, my country has provided\r\ntraining and consultancy services for agriculture, health,\r\nfuel and power, social development, the environment,\r\nfisheries, tourism, transport and communications, and\r\npublic administration.\r\nWith a view to promoting trade with Nicaragua, we\r\nare negotiating a free trade treaty, on which work is\r\nalready at the final stage. We are confident that\r\nnegotiations will have been concluded, at the latest, by\r\nthis year end.\r\nWe should like to conclude by appealing to the\r\ninternational community, and especially on the World\r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-\r\nAmerican Development Bank, to continue efforts aimed\r\nat achieving and consolidating Nicaragua’s economic and\r\nsocial development. Their support is needed to ensure that\r\npolitical, economic and social institutions are consolidated\r\nand that the foundations are laid for sustained economic\r\ngrowth and sustainable development.\r\nWe call on the General Assembly once again to give\r\nproof of its support for Nicaragua by adopting the draft\r\nresolution we have before us, when the time comes, by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): In considering the item on “International\r\nassistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\r\nNicaragua: aftermath of the war and natural disasters”, we\r\nhave to begin by recognizing the major efforts the\r\nNicaraguans have made over the last 12 months to ensure\r\nthat tolerance, dialogue and peace emerge as victors.\r\nAt the same time as peace in Nicaragua was being\r\nconsolidated, structural reform measures had to be\r\ninstituted in the economic and social sectors and a start\r\nhad to be made on the institutional rebuilding of the\r\ncountry. Thus we have a complex process of transition\r\nthat has to have resolute support from the international\r\ncommunity, and the United Nations in particular.\r\nAs the Secretary-General says in his report to the\r\nAssembly this year (A/50/535), last year saw\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\n“notable progress in the areas of reconciliation,\r\nmacroeconomic stabilization, the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and the organization of civil society”.\r\n(A/50/535, para. 5)\r\nHere we should like to commend the action taken by the\r\nPresident of Nicaragua, Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,\r\nwith support and cooperation from Nicaragua’s political and\r\nsocial forces.\r\nAt the same time, however, the continuing\r\ndeterioration in the social situation in Nicaragua could still\r\njeopardize the progress made in other areas. Now that the\r\npromotion of economic and social progress is continuing\r\nand finishing off the work of building the peace, the\r\ninternational community must continue, through its support\r\nfor Nicaragua’s rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts, to\r\nprovide assistance for overcoming all the aftermath of the\r\narmed conflict and fully consolidating the country’s stability\r\nand development. When the necessary internal conditions\r\nexist for the processes of development to bear fruit,\r\ninternational assistance shortens the time needed to extend\r\nits effects to the whole population and helps ensure that the\r\nobjectives of progress are reached while maintaining the\r\ngreatest possible social cohesion.\r\nNicaragua has occupied a very special position in\r\nSpain’s activities abroad over the last few years. Spain has\r\nhad very close links with Nicaragua in that country’s quest\r\nfor peace, and maintains those links now in building\r\nNicaragua’s progress, both through our own, national\r\nefforts and within the European Union framework.\r\nOver the past year, the Support Group — Canada,\r\nMexico, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden — continued\r\nits work. The Group, in close collaboration with the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) office in\r\nNicaragua, is attentively following the transition process\r\nand is trying to facilitate both consensus-building and the\r\nmerging of efforts in order to promote Nicaragua’s\r\nreconstruction and development.\r\nSpain’s bilateral cooperation has in addition sought to\r\nprovide unwavering support to Nicaragua’s efforts to\r\nachieve progress and prosperity for its people. A large\r\nnumber of programmes established by the Nicaraguan\r\nauthorities in sectors such as education and training, health,\r\ncivil administration, urban infrastructure and environmental\r\nprotection have had funding from Spain. We have also\r\nmade significant contributions in terms of food aid.\r\nIn addition to taking part in the agreements arranged\r\nthrough the Paris Club to achieve a substantial reduction\r\nin Nicaragua’s foreign debt, Spain has cancelled a large\r\npart of Nicaragua’s bilateral debt to it, as indicated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nOn 23 October, as the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations was being celebrated, the Spanish Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs signed an agreement with the\r\nAdministrator of UNDP with a view to setting up a Trust\r\nFund, with an initial contribution of $11 million from\r\nSpain, to fund programmes that help to strengthen\r\ngovernability in Central America. The fund will also\r\nbenefit Nicaragua in this crucial phase of its efforts to\r\nestablish peace and democracy and to promote economic\r\nand social development.\r\nFor all these reasons Spain urges the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations system to continue to\r\nprovide Nicaragua with support and assistance, with a\r\nview to consolidating peace and securing the democratic\r\nreconstruction and development of the country.\r\nMy country was a co-sponsor of the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted under this item at the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and we hope that, following\r\nconsultations with delegations, the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/50/L.18 will also be adopted by\r\nconsensus by the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nGermany fully supports the draft resolution on\r\ninternational assistance for the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of Nicaragua. For us, this is not merely a\r\ntext on paper but an expression of a policy that we\r\nourselves have promoted for many years.\r\nNicaragua has found peace, following years of\r\ninternal conflict, and is successfully attempting to\r\nstrengthen democracy and improve its economy. Today,\r\nall essential matters are being discussed in Parliament,\r\nand debate is translated into action through democratic\r\nchannels. Democracy and the rule of law have been\r\naccepted by the population in an unprecedented manner,\r\nnotwithstanding a few remaining problems. Obviously, the\r\naftermath of the conflict — which, happily, is over —\r\nstill weighs heavily on the country, and the situation has\r\nbeen further aggravated by natural disasters.\r\nNicaragua deserves firm support from the\r\ninternational community for its courageous efforts, which\r\nrequire significant sacrifices from the population.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nGermany, as the third-largest bilateral donor country, has\r\nthe honour of being in the forefront of international\r\ncooperation for Nicaragua’s development. I recall with\r\npleasure the day when President de Chamorro took office.\r\nAt that time I had the first talks with the then Foreign\r\nMinister on the question of an agreement to provide\r\nNicaragua with the financial means that it urgently needed\r\nto set itself on a course of reconstruction.\r\nAs a first step, large sums were made available to\r\nNicaragua for emergency measures. Today, extensive\r\nbilateral cooperation for development focuses primarily on\r\nthe consolidation of the structural-adjustment process;\r\nrehabilitation of the social infrastructure; and promotion of\r\nthe private-sector economy, including professional training,\r\nagricultural development and the protection of natural\r\nresources.\r\nAnother issue of importance to us is the advancement\r\nof women. Our cooperation is focused increasingly on rural\r\nareas. Germany’s commitments for official development aid\r\nto Nicaragua total to date approximately 800 million\r\nDeutsche Marks — or $570 million. New allocations in the\r\namount of approximately $40 million have been made this\r\nyear.\r\nOne of the consequences of the past is the extremely\r\nheavy external debt burden, which makes the country’s\r\neconomic revival extremely difficult. In this context, I\r\nparticularly welcome the fact that the recent German-\r\nNicaraguan negotiations on the rescheduling of the debt\r\nhave resulted in an overall, flexible solution that remains\r\nwithin the parameters of the solution agreed with\r\ninternational financial institutions. The agreement in\r\nquestion covers debts of more than 1 billion Deutsche\r\nMarks — around $820 million — consisting mostly of\r\nsums owed to the former German Democratic Republic.\r\nThe agreement envisages also the liquidation of debts\r\nthrough the application of environmental-protection\r\nmeasures. Consequently, Nicaragua’s debt to Germany has\r\nbeen reduced by some 80 per cent — that is, beyond the 77\r\nper cent agreed upon in the international context. We hope\r\nthat other countries that are creditors of Nicaragua will\r\nfollow our example.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in the\r\ndebate on this item.\r\nI should like to inform members that action on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.18 will be taken at a later date, to be\r\nannounced.\r\nAgenda item 41\r\nSupport by the United Nations system of the efforts of\r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or\r\nrestored democracies\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/50/332 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.19)\r\nThe President: I call on the Deputy Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Nicaragua, His Excellency Mr. José\r\nBernard Pallais, to introduce draft resolution A/50/L.19.\r\nMr. Pallais (Nicaragua) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The First International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies was held in Manila in June 1988,\r\nand 13 countries participated. The Second Conference\r\nwas held in the region of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean — in Managua — and 77 States, participants\r\nand observers, were present. The Third Conference will\r\nbe held in Europe in 1996, and we hope that on that\r\noccasion there will be even more participants.\r\nThe main objective of the First and Second\r\nInternational Conferences of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, which took place in the Philippines and in\r\nNicaragua respectively, was not just to reaffirm the\r\nextreme importance and effectiveness of representative\r\ndemocracy as a system of government — through a wide\r\nexamination of the question of governance in new\r\ndemocracies: its successes, its weaknesses, its prospects\r\nand challenges within the new international context — but\r\nalso to create greater awareness in the international\r\ncommunity of the complexity of these processes, which\r\nrequire the international community’s attention and\r\nsupport, in accordance with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, to strengthen the maintenance\r\nof peace and international security and economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\nIn that light, those who participated in the Manila\r\nand Managua Conferences took the initiative of requesting\r\nthe Secretary-General, through the General Assembly, to\r\nstudy the ways and mechanisms in which the United\r\nNations system could support the efforts to promote and\r\nconsolidate democracies. Without a doubt, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report and the discussion thereon in the General\r\nAssembly will make an important contribution to the\r\nThird International Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, to be held in Romania in 1996, at which\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nimportant issues requiring reflection and action will be\r\ntaken up once again.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on this item distributed\r\nat this session of the General Assembly explains that\r\n“The United Nations system, in assisting and\r\nsupporting the efforts of Governments to promote and\r\nconsolidate new or restored democracies, does not\r\nendorse or promote any specific form of government”.\r\n(A/50/332, para. 5)\r\nThe Secretary-General went on to state that\r\n“By democratization, I mean a process by which an\r\nauthoritarian society becomes increasingly\r\nparticipatory through such mechanisms as periodic\r\nelections to representative bodies, the accountability of\r\npublic officials, a transparent public administration, an\r\nindependent judiciary and a free press”. (ibid, para. 6)\r\nWe agree that democracy is not, and cannot be, an end\r\nin itself. It must not only resolve a society’s fundamental\r\nproblems but also promote the full development of the\r\nwhole individual, with a strong emphasis on economic and\r\nsocial development, social justice and the necessary\r\nparticipation of all citizens in building a civil, pluralistic\r\nand participatory society.\r\nAs is made clear in the report, this objective can be\r\nachieved only in steps. The pace at which democratization\r\nmoves forward inevitably depends on a series of political,\r\neconomic, social and cultural factors, some of which, in\r\nsome societies, perhaps do not lend themselves to rapid\r\nchange. Democracy is a process requiring constant and\r\ntireless work, but to date it is the form of government that\r\nbest meets the requirements of peoples and most adequately\r\nfacilitates their potential for development. This is a concept\r\nthat is constantly changing and is in full evolution as a\r\nresult of the demands of politics and of history.\r\nWe are fully aware that the transition to democracy is\r\nnot easy; Nicaragua is a case in point. This transition\r\nrequires not only a commitment on the part of political\r\nleaders but also, and more important, the unwavering\r\nsupport and cooperation of the people. Democracy demands\r\nof itself that it at all times demonstrate that it is the best\r\nform of government and that it provides the greatest\r\nbenefits to all members of society as a whole.\r\nOn this point, we are convinced that economic and\r\nsocial development are more likely to flourish in a\r\ndemocracy based on the rule of law than in a dictatorship,\r\nin which political and economic decisions cannot be\r\ncriticized by a parliament, by a free press or by any\r\nmember of society.\r\nStrengthening democratic structures worldwide is the\r\nvery essence of the work being carried out through the\r\ncooperation of the United Nations system. The pioneering\r\nrole played in Nicaragua by the United Nations Observer\r\nMission entrusted with verifying the electoral process, and\r\nin other countries through various initiatives, is clearly\r\nshown in the aforementioned report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThe Managua Plan of Action expressed the need to\r\nbuild and to strengthen modalities for international\r\ncooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels that\r\nwould be adapted to the differing realities of new or\r\nrestored democracies, in order to strengthen democracy\r\nand peace with development. There is without a doubt a\r\nfundamental and special relationship between the\r\npromotion of democracy, sustainable development and\r\npeace.\r\nWe believe that democracy must be promoted and\r\nachieved on the basis of respect for the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and strict\r\nobservance of commitments undertaken by Governments\r\nin various international instruments, in particular in the\r\nfield of respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms and in the realization of the right to\r\ndevelopment, which guarantees the full exercise of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe task of promoting and consolidating democracy\r\ncannot be undertaken by any Government alone. The\r\nparticipation of the civil society of each State is required,\r\nas is an international environment of cooperation and\r\npeace. Democracy can be achieved only when efforts are\r\nmade to guarantee political pluralism, freedom of\r\nexpression, economic consolidation, social development,\r\ndialogue, tolerance, reconciliation and full respect for\r\nindividual and collective freedoms.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has pointed in his report,\r\nelections are necessary, but not sufficient, to guarantee a\r\nlasting democratization process. To meet the challenges\r\nposed by democracy and its implementation, the\r\nSecretary-General recommends in his report that\r\n“the Secretariat and all agencies increase their\r\ncooperation in the area of institution-building and\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\ngovernance, in particular through strengthening\r\ncapacity-building of democratic institutions”. (ibid.,\r\npara. 127)\r\nIn supporting this democratization process, different\r\ncomponents of the United Nations system should pay\r\nparticular attention to such key areas as the strengthening\r\nof leadership skills and public institutions; support for\r\neffective judiciaries that guarantee the rule of law and the\r\nprotection of fundamental rights; the strengthening of links\r\nbetween government and civil society through non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the media, local governments\r\nand professional associations; and participation in the\r\ndecentralization process.\r\nOn behalf of the new or restored democracies, we\r\nreaffirm that the tenets of the Managua Declaration should\r\nbe reiterated, as the conceptual framework for the support\r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations system.\r\nIn this respect, it must be emphasized that a solid\r\ndemocratic and pluralistic system, based on the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the\r\ncovenants and international conventions on human rights, is\r\nclosely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at\r\npromoting sustainable development, improving the standard\r\nof living of the lowest-income segments of society, and\r\npromoting civil and political freedoms and equality of\r\nopportunities.\r\nWe need to recall that development — a fundamental\r\nright of nations — promotes the full exercise of democracy.\r\nWe must not forget that economic-reform and\r\nstructural- adjustment programmes disconnected from social\r\nrealities can destabilize democratic-transition processes and\r\nfuel political and social tensions. We have focused on the\r\nneed to promote economic reforms that will ensure a\r\nsocial-security system for the most vulnerable, low-income\r\ngroups in order to eradicate poverty.\r\nIn particular, we would like to suggest that the\r\nSecretary-General continue to reflect on this item and that,\r\nin the report he will be preparing, he should emphasize,\r\ninter alia, the following aspects: first, the measures that can\r\nbe taken to encourage Governments to commit themselves\r\nto eradicating poverty, in the knowledge that eliminating\r\npoverty means defending democracy because political\r\ncredibility will be undermined if people’s standards of\r\nliving are not improved; secondly, ways to encourage the\r\ndrafting of a comprehensive proposal that includes criteria\r\nand modalities for international cooperation with new or\r\nrestored democracies, with particular emphasis on a\r\nflexible approach to external debt, mechanisms for\r\npromoting investment, concessional flows of resources,\r\nand open-trade policies; thirdly, ways of supporting\r\ninitiatives taken in various United Nations organs and\r\nbodies to strengthen democratization processes,\r\npeacemaking and economic and social development; and\r\nfourthly, ways also to promote the principle of the\r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts both among new or\r\nrestored democracies and with other members of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe need to emphasize that the United Nations\r\nsystem and the Bretton Woods institutions should promote\r\ngreater awareness of the real difficulties and obstacles\r\nfacing new or restored democracies, particularly in the\r\nleast developed countries, and of the danger that\r\nstructural-adjustment programmes that disregard the social\r\nimpact and the specific characteristics of transition may\r\nundermine the consolidation of democratic processes.\r\nThe United Nations has vast experience in activities\r\nfor peace and development. Initiatives in areas such as\r\ndecolonization, the environment, sustainable development,\r\npopulation, the eradication of disease, disarmament and\r\nthe development of international law, and in a host of\r\nother areas, have made an enormous contribution to\r\nstrengthening the foundations of a peaceful world.\r\nOnce again, we welcome the vision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who has included democracy among the five\r\npillars of development and sees it as the major task facing\r\nthe international community and the greatest challenge for\r\nour Organization.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations has a role to\r\nplay alongside countries which, in all sovereignty, have\r\ncommitted themselves to democratic processes. The\r\ntransition to democracy is part of the new international\r\norder, and the United Nations system must respond to the\r\nobvious aspirations of peoples and Governments, which\r\nare prompting them to contribute to world peace.\r\nAt the Conferences in Manila and Managua, we laid\r\nthe bases for the promotion and consolidation of new or\r\nrestored democracies. That endeavour will continue at the\r\nBucharest Conference. Over one third of the Member\r\nStates of our Organization took part in the Manila and\r\nManagua Conferences. Our experience and aspirations\r\ndeserve serious thought and the implementation of a new\r\nUnited Nations programme designed primarily to\r\nstrengthen democracy and democratic institutions. This\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nidea can draw on the contributions and experience of the\r\nforum of new or restored democracies, the Secretariat and\r\ninterested States in order to meet this universal challenge\r\nfor good governance for future generations.\r\nAllow me now to highlight some essential aspects of\r\nthe draft resolution submitted by Nicaragua on behalf of the\r\nco-sponsors. It is contained in document A/50/L.19 and is\r\nentitled “Support by the United Nations system of the\r\nefforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or\r\nrestored democracies”.\r\nThe preamble once again reaffirms the importance of\r\nthe Managua Declaration and the implementation of the\r\nPlan of Action adopted at the Second International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies as Set Out in\r\nresolution 49/30. Particular emphasis is placed on the fact\r\nthat the international community must, as a matter of\r\nurgency, pay closer attention to the obstacles facing the\r\nnew or restored democracies. It is noted that throughout all\r\ncontinents of the world a considerable number of societies\r\nhave recently initiated bold, profound and daring attempts\r\nto achieve their social, political and economic objectives\r\nthrough democratization.\r\nThe draft resolution commends the work of the\r\nSecretary-General and through him the United Nations\r\nsystem for the activities undertaken at the request of\r\nMember States to support the efforts to consolidate\r\ndemocracy. It recognizes that our Organization has an\r\nimportant role to play in providing timely, adequate and\r\nmutually reinforcing support to the efforts of Governments\r\nto achieve democratization within the context of the\r\nrealities and limits of their development efforts.\r\nSimilarly, the Secretary-General is encouraged to\r\ncontinue to optimize the capacity of the Organization to\r\nrespond effectively to the requests of Member States for the\r\nprovision of coordinated cooperation and assistance\r\nnecessary in this field. The Secretary-General is also\r\nrequested to submit a report to the General Assembly, at its\r\nfifty-first session, on the implementation of the present\r\nresolution, including innovative ways and means to enable\r\nthe Organization to support the efforts of Governments and\r\nto respond effectively and in an integrated manner to\r\nrequests of Member States.\r\nFinally, under the draft resolution the General\r\nAssembly would decide to include in the provisional agenda\r\nof its fifty-first session an item entitled “Support by the\r\nUnited Nations system of the efforts of Governments to\r\npromote and consolidate new or restored democracies”.\r\nNicaragua, acting as secretariat of the Conference for\r\nthe time being, and speaking now on behalf of the co-\r\nsponsors, trusts that this draft resolution will be adopted\r\nunanimously by the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to say that the spirit of the next\r\ncentury can already be felt, and as the next millennium\r\ndawns our world continues to face critical global\r\nproblems which we feel can be alleviated through the\r\nimplementation of a three-pronged approach which the\r\nUnited Nations of the future will have to take into\r\naccount. This three-pronged approach is expressed in the\r\nimplementation of the Agenda for Peace, the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment and an agenda for democracy whose links\r\nand interdependence are a fundamental element of the\r\nnew world order we hope to build.\r\nMr. Mukasa-Ssali (Uganda): My delegation\r\nexpresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport contained in document A/50/332 and Add.1. In\r\nparticular, my delegation shares the view that democracy\r\nis not a model to be copied from certain States, but a goal\r\nto be attained by all States and peoples in accordance\r\nwith different circumstances and peculiarities. What\r\ntherefore should count, in the final analysis, is that there\r\nis peace and security, national unity and a culture of\r\ntolerance, freedom of political participation and good\r\ngovernance, and that these are all based on the principles\r\nof respect for human rights and dignity.\r\nNumerous plans and programmes have been adopted\r\nby individual Governments and the United Nations system\r\nwith the express intention of providing greater support for\r\na democratic culture world wide. The achievements in\r\nthis area are today being felt, due particularly to the\r\ngeneral distaste for dictatorships and to the desire of\r\nGovernments to end internal conflicts and lay a solid\r\nfoundation for peace, stability and development in their\r\ncountries.\r\nThe international community and the United Nations\r\nshould therefore build on this atmosphere and what has\r\nbeen achieved so far. Foremost, where democratization\r\nhas begun unfolding, there is need for increased and\r\nstrengthened support in such vital areas as civic\r\neducation, constitution-making and electoral assistance, as\r\nwell as in the building of democratic institutions and the\r\nlaunching of programmes to promote national unity,\r\nespecially through the politics of inclusion and a culture\r\nof tolerance among the various segments of a given\r\ncountry. In any case, people should be the centre and\r\nobject of democracy. To this end, any support should\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\ninvolve the people in the conception, implementation and\r\nmonitoring of democratic processes. Special attention\r\nshould be paid to the full involvement of women and youth\r\nin the evolution of political order.\r\nThe areas I have enumerated and related areas are\r\nnecessary, but not sufficient. A strong institutional\r\nframework that addresses such issues as development\r\nshould be targeted for democracy to take root. Support and\r\nassistance should not end at the holding of free and fair\r\nelections. Experience shows that weak economies only\r\nmanage to sustain democracy at a very high cost — often\r\nat the cost of development. Moreover, it is acknowledged\r\nthat without democracy and peace, development is not\r\npossible and that, conversely, without development, peace\r\nand democracy cannot be durable. Therefore, efforts that\r\nentail the enhancement and promotion of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment are crucial during democratic processes and in\r\ntheir aftermath. In this respect, the United Nations\r\ndevelopment system should be further strengthened and\r\nsupported to respond effectively to the needs of\r\ndevelopment and democratic sustenance. The United\r\nNations itself should be accorded the necessary financial\r\nresources to successfully fulfil all its mandated activities in\r\nthese areas.\r\nThe whole question of democratization makes it\r\ndifficult for the United Nations system alone to support the\r\nentire spectrum of programmes in the area. The cooperation\r\nof Governments at bilateral and regional levels, as well as\r\nthe support of financial institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations, will continue to play a significant role. In the\r\ncontinuum of activities, however, coordination is of the\r\nessence.\r\nMay I add that Uganda joins in sponsoring draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.19.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the representative of\r\nLatvia, I should like to propose that the list of speakers in\r\nthe debate on this item be closed today at noon.\r\nI hear no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I therefore request those\r\nrepresentatives wishing to participate in the debate to\r\ninscribe their names as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Baumanis (Latvia): The birth, nurturing and\r\ngrowth of democracy is a long and complex process. One\r\nof the most fundamental principles which describe a\r\ntotalitarian regime and communist ideology is “If he is\r\nnot with us, he is against us”. The aggressiveness of this\r\nideology enslaved Latvia for 50 years. Now this is\r\nchanging, step by step, in order to reflect the required\r\nopenness and understanding into which all social and\r\ngovernmental structures are integrated.\r\nJust over four years ago independence and\r\ndemocracy were re-established in Latvia. We are proud\r\nthat our independence was achieved democratically and\r\nwithout bloodshed. We are grateful to the friendly\r\ndemocratic Governments which supported us.\r\nLatvia, through its free and fair election of a\r\npluralist Parliament, has established a sound basis for a\r\ndemocratic political and institutional system. We shall\r\ncontinue our efforts to strengthen political, judicial and\r\nlegal institutions based on the rule of law and respect for\r\nhuman rights. We are striving to establish well-trained\r\nand well-equipped public services and administrations for\r\nthe efficient and effective implementation of new\r\nlegislation and regulations. In addition, we are\r\nundertaking coherent reform of our legal system in order\r\nto set up a stable, legal and institutional framework\r\nindispensable for the smooth functioning of a market\r\neconomy.\r\nThe latter — reform of the legal system — is a\r\npriority for Latvia. While, traditionally, the existence of\r\nthe rule of law has been based on the division of power\r\nbetween the legislature, the executive and the judiciary,\r\nthe independence of the judiciary is a concept that was\r\nunknown in the former Soviet Union, where the courts\r\nand lawyers were used as repressive instruments of the\r\nState. Thus, establishing the independence of the courts,\r\nsubjecting executive, legislative and administrative acts to\r\nthe review of the court and ensuring respect for the\r\ndecisions of the courts is a priority for Latvia.\r\nThe necessary process of transition to a market\r\neconomy is, like any other revolutionary change,\r\noccurring concurrently with other complex developments.\r\nPrivatization, policies supporting investment, and effective\r\ntax structures are mechanisms which will enable us, in the\r\nnear future, to revive and secure our national economy.\r\nMuch remains to be done by the new or restored\r\ndemocracies to secure their democratic systems. Societies\r\nexpect to find in democracy a solution to all of their\r\nproblems, including those which would be difficult to\r\nsolve under any system of government, in particular\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\neconomic and social problems. If democratic institutions\r\nwork ineffectively, are associated with corruption or\r\nimpotence or are unable to resolve problems, a window is\r\nopened to authoritarian and totalitarian forces to weaken\r\ndemocracy.\r\nTherefore, democracies must apply their greatest\r\nefforts to limiting the shadow side, from which no\r\ndemocracy is immune. It means that all members of\r\nsociety, irrespective of political affiliation, have a\r\nresponsibility to put the collective interest before their own,\r\nto seek effective solutions to economic and social problems.\r\nIn this great Hall, in which so many representatives of\r\nStates that gained their independence quite recently are\r\npresent, we understand how important sovereignty is to\r\nevery nation. To secure it we must overcome many\r\nobstacles. Clearly, Latvia cannot solve all its problems by\r\nitself and depends greatly on the involvement and support\r\nof the international community. Meanwhile, of course, no\r\nState can expect the international community to solve all of\r\nits problems.\r\nWe have deep appreciation for the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and its office in Riga for\r\ntheir substantial assistance in the further development of the\r\ndemocratic institutions in Latvia. A priority of utmost\r\nimportance would be to arrange specific financial and\r\nadvisory support for countries of new or restored\r\ndemocracies, to help pave the road to a stable and socially\r\nbalanced society.\r\nIn our opinion, the security of small States should be\r\na central concern of this Organization, since at this time\r\nthere does not exist a balance of power or agreement on\r\ngoals between small States and their larger neighbours. The\r\nUnited Nations must ensure that the world economic\r\nenvironment is conducive to the growth of small States. All\r\nStates should be able to participate in the formulation of\r\nmacroeconomic policies.\r\nNow that the cold war is over and the bipolarity of the\r\nworld has ended, contradictions between the big Powers no\r\nlonger constitute the main threat to peace and security in\r\nthe world. The security of small States is gradually coming\r\nto the foreground. These States are particularly interested in\r\nstrengthening the international security institutions and\r\nmaking the most effective use of them. In this context, we\r\nconsider the opening of existing European and transatlantic\r\nsecurity institutions to Central European and Baltic\r\ncountries to be extremely important.\r\nThe building of the new European security\r\narchitecture, which would help smaller nations, such as\r\nLatvia, feel more secure, should include: mutually\r\nsupportive enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and the European Union, close\r\ncooperation between partners within the framework of the\r\nPartnership for Peace Programme, enhanced dialogue\r\nbetween Russia and NATO, and discussions and\r\nconsultations in the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) on issues not directly\r\ndealt with by the European Union and NATO.\r\nFor the stability of our continent it is very important\r\nfor countries to act in compliance with the norms set in\r\nOSCE documents, particularly in the Charter of Paris for\r\na New Europe and the Code of Conduct adopted at the\r\nOSCE Summit in Budapest, and with existing arms\r\ncontrol agreements, especially the Treaty on Conventional\r\nForces in Europe (CFE).\r\nWell-structured, effective, mutually independent and\r\ncollaborative State institutions, an equitable political\r\nsystem, a harmonized legal system, overall security and\r\neconomic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic\r\nState. By enhancing each of these elements separately,\r\ndemocracy as a whole is strengthened. We are convinced\r\nthat given peace and time and a friendly, supportive\r\ninternational environment all of these aims will be\r\nachieved.\r\nMr. Ahmed (India): Democracy, in its multifaceted\r\ndimensions, has acquired the status of a global norm of\r\ngovernance. While it takes many diverse forms,\r\ndepending on the specific characteristics of a society and\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of a State, the essence of a\r\ndemocracy is respect for the will of the people.\r\nConsequently, it is only to be expected that, as an\r\nOrganization whose Charter was drawn up in the name of\r\nthe peoples of the United Nations, the United Nations\r\nsystem needs to extend unfailing support to the efforts of\r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or restored\r\ndemocracies. My delegation is thus happy to be among\r\nthe sponsors of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/50/L.19.\r\nAs the world’s largest functioning democracy, India\r\nhas an abiding commitment to the principles and practice\r\nof democracy. We stand firmly behind United Nations\r\nefforts in this area of activity and welcome the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s report contained in document A/50/332,\r\ndetailing the contours of United Nations support in a wide\r\nspectrum of areas.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nMy delegation endorses the Secretary General’s\r\nobservation that\r\n“Democracy is not a model to be copied from certain\r\nStates, but a goal to be attained by all peoples”.\r\n(A/50/332 and Corr. 1, para. 5)\r\nIt is our firm belief that no prescriptive norms can be\r\nimposed on a society in the name of democratization. All\r\nefforts at strengthening the democratization process in the\r\nnew or restored democracies should flow from the requests\r\nof the Governments of Member States and should be\r\nexerted and in the ways agreed to and accepted by the\r\nGovernments of the States concerned.\r\nAs the will of the people is expressed in sovereign\r\nindependent States through participation in electoral\r\nprocesses, my delegation notes with appreciation that the\r\nUnited Nations has responded to 77 of the 89 requests by\r\nMember States for electoral assistance. This process of\r\nsupport for the electoral process, in our view, needs to be\r\nencouraged. The United Nations must firmly and strongly\r\ndiscourage attempts by groups adopting violent means to\r\nthwart people’s participation in electoral processes.\r\nMr. Kulla (Albania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nElectoral assistance, by its very nature, is of finite\r\nduration and should be based on the request of the State\r\nconcerned. We welcome the observation of the Secretary\r\nGeneral that United Nations electoral assistance is\r\nultimately aimed at the creation of its own obsolescence.\r\nWhile it is true that the breadth of the democratization\r\nprocess encompasses a broad spectrum of activities apart\r\nfrom electoral assistance, and may include institution-\r\nbuilding, constitutional reforms and civic education, we\r\nwould like to recall that General Assembly resolution\r\n47/120 B, which dealt among other matters with post-\r\nconflict peace-building, is relevant in this regard. The\r\nprinciples which the General Assembly emphasized as the\r\nbasis of a United Nations role in that resolution, in our\r\nconsidered view, also need to be adhered to, in the context\r\nof support of the United Nations system to the efforts of\r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or restored\r\ndemocracies.\r\nThe United Nations agencies involved in the entire\r\nrange of processes covered under this omnibus goal should\r\nensure that their activities are carried out in accordance\r\nwith the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular the sovereign equality and political independence\r\nof States, territorial integrity, and non-intervention in\r\nmatters that are essentially within the domestic\r\njurisdiction of any State. Further, it need not be reiterated\r\nthat the request of the concerned Government is a sine\r\nqua non for a United Nations role.\r\nNot only does the democratic process to be nurtured\r\nand consolidated require superstructural assistance from\r\nthe United Nations system, but it is also essential for\r\ndemocracies to be supported in the achievement of their\r\ncore economic and social goals. The challenge of\r\ndemocratization cannot be met by Governments alone,\r\nespecially if assistance for economic development and\r\npoverty eradication is placed on the back burner by\r\ninternational agencies.\r\nThe long-term and sustained development of\r\ndemocracy as a goal to be assimilated and attained by all\r\nsocieties requires that the nascent and developing\r\ndemocracies fulfil their economic and social programmes.\r\nThe Governments will, of necessity, play a primary role.\r\nHowever, at a time when global interdependence is an\r\nacknowledged fact, the international milieu also has to be\r\nresponsive to their needs. Better terms of trade, enhanced\r\naccess to markets, increased and stable investment flows,\r\naccess to technology on a non-discriminatory basis and\r\navailability of increased overseas development assistance\r\nare needed to meet their critical requirements. It is\r\ntherefore essential for the United Nations system also to\r\nfocus on these issues in the context of its support to the\r\ndemocratization process.\r\nIndia believes that democracy and transparent and\r\naccountable governance and administration in all sectors\r\nof society are indispensable foundations for the realization\r\nof social development. We acknowledge the\r\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship\r\nbetween democracy and development. Democracy ensures\r\nthat decisions are taken with the fullest participation of\r\nthose who will be affected. It ensures not only local\r\nself-governance but also participative self-governance.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would also like to mention that\r\nIndia has participated actively in the process of\r\nestablishing, along with other like-minded countries, the\r\nInternational Institute for Democracy and Electoral\r\nAssistance as an intergovernmental organization based in\r\nStockholm. As one of the 14 founder members, India\r\nlooks forward to participating in all its activities, aimed\r\nat promoting and advancing democracy, improving and\r\nconsolidating electoral processes, strengthening and\r\nsupporting national capacity to develop the full range of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\ndemocratic instruments, and promoting transparency and\r\naccountability in the context of democratic development.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Spain, speaking on behalf of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nMr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,\r\nRomania and Slovakia align themselves with the content of\r\nthis statement.\r\nDuring the last two decades, a process of\r\ndemocratization has brought sweeping changes in various\r\nregions of the world. Initiated in Southern Europe, in the\r\nmid-1970s, that process took hold subsequently in large\r\nparts of Asia, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe.\r\nFittingly, the First International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies took place in Manila in 1988,\r\nfollowed by the Second Conference in Managua in 1994.\r\nBucharest will host the third such conference, reflecting the\r\ngeography of the democratization that took place during the\r\ntwo decades.\r\nThose conferences have provided an opportunity for\r\na large number of countries to share their experiences and\r\nhave underlined the genuine character of the quest they\r\nhave undertaken for certain representative political\r\nstructures and an increasing role for civil society.\r\nIrrespective of the differences in the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of their respective societies, or their tradition\r\nand experience in democratic institution-building, these\r\ncountries share a common belief that democratization\r\nenhances the daily lives of their citizens.\r\nAll these countries are focusing on transition from\r\nauthoritarian structures to more participatory societies; other\r\ncountries, in addition, are undergoing the transition from\r\nState-directed to free market economies. Yet others are in\r\ntransition from a situation of conflict to a process of\r\nnational reconciliation. The context may also be different.\r\nThe emergence of a process of democratization may take\r\nplace in a context of post-conflict peace- building, or as\r\npart of efforts to improve the capacity of Governments for\r\nthe creation of a suitable environment for the achievement\r\nof sustainable development.\r\nDemocracy is an essential element in the establishment\r\nof that environment. In the first place, it provides the only\r\nlong-term basis for bringing competing social interests\r\ntogether in a way that minimizes the risks of internal\r\nconflicts. In addition, inasmuch as enhancing good\r\ngovernance and management practices is an essential\r\ncondition for the success of any strategy for development,\r\nadvancing the cause of political participation has a great\r\nimpact on all aspects of development efforts. Democracy\r\nitself is an important measure for development.\r\nDemocracy, development and respect for human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms are interdependent and\r\nmutually reinforcing.\r\nSocieties lacking in democracy tend to mirror each\r\nother’s problems. Often the absence of representative\r\nstructures indicates the presence of deep social\r\ninequalities and the entrenchment of ruling elites, which\r\nperpetuates a vicious circle of poor governance and a lack\r\nof political accountability to the majority of the citizens.\r\nBy providing for greater transparency and by establishing\r\nmechanisms for participation, democracy makes it more\r\nlikely that national policies will reflect a broader range of\r\nsocial aspirations. Further, the existence of institutions\r\nthat considerably reduce the uncertainties of political life\r\nstrengthens the capacity of Governments to carry out their\r\nfunctions effectively.\r\nFinally, the political empowerment of community\r\nstructures and grass-roots organizations is a way of\r\nensuring that, on the one hand, the citizenry is not\r\nexcluded from the decision-making process and thus is\r\nless likely to look for violent ways of manifesting\r\ngrievances, and that, on the other hand, its experiences\r\nare factored into, and reflected in, decisions taken in the\r\narea of development.\r\nLet us not forget that societies, irrespective of their\r\neconomic indicators, can be in transition in many other\r\nways. Even in rich societies, people can be unemployed\r\nand politically or socially disenfranchised. Economic\r\nunderdevelopment is not the only cause of the conflicts\r\nthat have been gnawing at the conscience of humanity in\r\nrecent years.\r\nPluralism is essential to the transition to a\r\ndemocratic government, but in a larger sense —\r\nencompassing periodic elections, the accountability of\r\npublic officials, a transparent public administration, an\r\nindependent judiciary and a free press. A democratic\r\nculture requires a dynamic civil society. Social\r\ndevelopment must spring from society itself. In the\r\ncommon endeavour for democracy and development,\r\nGovernments must ensure close cooperation with\r\nnon-governmental organizations, private enterprises, trade\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nunions and other social groups. Furthermore, the\r\nempowerment of women remains a major goal in this\r\nregard. As the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out,\r\npolicies and institutions that suppress the real potential of\r\nhalf of the Earth’s population must be reformed. The full\r\nempowerment and participation of women, on an equal\r\nbasis and in all spheres of society, including in the\r\ndecision-making process and access to power, are\r\nfundamental for the achievement of full equality,\r\ndevelopment and peace.\r\nThe Secretary-General outlines in his report\r\n(A/50/332) the ways in which the United Nations system\r\nhas been assisting States, at their request, in their efforts to\r\npromote a democratic culture, provide electoral assistance\r\nand assist in the strengthening of institutions.\r\nSome of those efforts are being exerted in the midst\r\nof conflict situations or in the context of reconstruction and\r\npeace-building. The promotion of democratization and\r\nsustainable human development is widely accepted as a\r\nprerequisite for countries to resume their progress and\r\nrebuild their capacity as soon as possible. Thus, the success\r\nof large peace-keeping or peace-building efforts hinges on\r\nthe existence of a sound foundation for peace.\r\nDemocratization has been, in one way or another, both the\r\nend and the means in the settlement of persistent conflicts\r\nin Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique or Haiti.\r\nConversely, the lack of a long-term commitment to this\r\nobjective on the part of national protagonists or the\r\ninternational community can undermine stability and\r\nreignite a conflict situation. The so-called oblivion\r\nsyndrome has posed an ever-present risk to the\r\nconsolidation of the various peace-making and\r\ndemocratization processes.\r\nSimilarly, the idea of the need to integrate and\r\ncoordinate the efforts of the various agencies and\r\ndepartments in the aftermath of political settlements was\r\nborne out originally by experiences in Cambodia, El\r\nSalvador or Haiti.\r\nA number of departments in the Secretariat and the\r\nspecialized agencies are committed to efforts towards\r\ndemocratization, both at Headquarters and in the field.\r\nConsequently, one of the major themes running through the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General is the enhancement of\r\ncoordination within the United Nations system. At\r\nHeadquarters, coordination can be adequately strengthened,\r\nas indicated by the Secretary-General, through the early\r\ninvolvement of all relevant sectors in the preparation of\r\ncountry-specific programmes by the agencies. In the field,\r\nimproved inter-agency cooperation requires further\r\nstrengthening of the Resident Coordinator system of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nadditional measures recommended during the triennial\r\npolicy review of operational activities for development, in\r\norder to ensure an efficient division of labour.\r\nUNDP has played a key supportive role, in particular\r\nin strengthening institutions and infrastructures as well as\r\nin electoral assistance, in close cooperation with the\r\nSecretariat’s Electoral Assistance Division. Through a\r\nvariety of arrangements, and at the request of individual\r\nrecipient countries, UNDP has supported the efforts of\r\nGovernments to maximize the effectiveness of activities\r\nfor development.\r\nAlso of great importance are the activities\r\nundertaken by the Centre for Human Rights in providing,\r\nwith considerably fewer resources, technical assistance for\r\nthe reform of legislation, the administration of justice and\r\nthe strengthening of democratic institutions, including\r\nthrough the training of security forces.\r\nThe Electoral Assistance Division has done a\r\ncommendable job of handling the increasing number of\r\nrequests from Member States for electoral assistance,\r\nwhich by June this year had risen to a total of 89. With\r\nscant resources, it has conducted needs-assessment\r\nmissions, provided technical assistance and carried out a\r\nvariety of supporting and coordinating activities related to\r\nthe observation and verification of electoral processes.\r\nAlso noteworthy are the efforts of the World Bank\r\nin fields such as the strengthening of infrastructures and\r\ncivil-service reform, as well as its efforts to improve the\r\naccountability, transparency and quality of public-sector\r\nmanagement. Other organizations, such as the\r\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) and the Crime\r\nPrevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the Secretariat,\r\nare actively engaged in the creation and strengthening of\r\ndemocratic structures of government and in the\r\nenhancement of the rule of law.\r\nCoordination must also be fostered in the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations system and\r\nregional organizations, such as the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS), the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. As the Secretary-General\r\npoints out and advocates, these and other protagonists are\r\nnatural partners of both Governments and the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nOrganization. This has been made abundantly clear not only\r\nas concerns electoral assistance but also and increasingly in\r\nother, equally important areas. More than 1,000 non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that enjoy consultative status\r\nwith the United Nations, and many more without that\r\nstatus, are involved in these activities. Taken together, they\r\ncan be considered as a network which complements that of\r\nthe United Nations and whose development should be\r\nencouraged with a view to its effective use.\r\nThe European Union as a whole and its member\r\nStates, nationally, are actively supporting activities related\r\nto democratization. Under the Treaty on European Union,\r\nthe consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms are identified\r\nas key objectives. Within this framework, the European\r\nUnion is financing numerous projects in developing\r\ncountries related to electoral assistance and freedom of\r\nexpression, the strengthening of civil society and human\r\nrights education and training. Assistance in the field of\r\ndemocratization has also been provided to Central and\r\nEastern European countries and the newly independent\r\nStates. Recently the European Union and its member States\r\nhave been among the leading supporters of the human\r\nrights operations in Rwanda and Burundi.\r\nThe Secretary-General has provided us with a\r\nthorough, thought-provoking account of what the United\r\nNations system, in coordination with other actors, has been\r\nable to do. In sum, we would like to commend the United\r\nNations for its successful efforts in this field. We agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General on the need to promote\r\nsustainable development and democracy throughout the\r\nworld. To achieve that goal, funds are needed, which means\r\nthat the deterioration of the United Nations financial\r\nposition must be reversed. The commitment in this regard\r\nmust be equal to the challenge facing the Organization. We\r\nexpect and encourage the Secretary-General to continue his\r\nconsideration of ways in which the United Nations can rise\r\nto the challenge of supporting all the efforts aimed at the\r\npromotion of democratization and the consolidation of new\r\nor restored democracies.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): Malta associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Spain on behalf of\r\nthe European Union.\r\nUnited Nations support for the efforts of Governments\r\nto promote and consolidate new or restored democracies is\r\nof special significance as we commemorate the\r\nOrganization’s fiftieth anniversary. This topic takes us to\r\nthe very heart of that which inspired so many of the authors\r\nof the Charter. During the recent Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting, our Heads of State and Government reaffirmed\r\ntheir commitment to those fundamental principles which\r\noriginally animated the Organization and should guide its\r\nwork in the future. The keystone on which the United\r\nNations rests is the belief\r\n“in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and\r\nworth of the human person, in the equal rights of\r\nmen and women and of nations large and small”.\r\nThe past five years have witnessed momentous\r\nchange, but they have also been fraught with political,\r\nsocial and economic upheavals. In Europe the storming of\r\nthe Berlin Wall is both a beacon of hope for the future\r\nand a reminder of that tragic past when democracy was\r\ntrampled upon and denied to millions.\r\nThe popular will to secure and consolidate\r\ndemocracy has determined a global transition.\r\nAuthoritarian regimes worldwide have been forced to bow\r\ntheir heads to the will and expectations of peoples.\r\nDemocratic governance has replaced imposition in places\r\nwhere such a turn of events was inconceivable only a few\r\nyears ago.\r\nReflecting on those events as President of the forty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly, my Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Guido de\r\nMarco, stressed the impact of respect for or denial of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms on international\r\nbehaviour; promotion of human rights should be\r\nintensified and be given the highest priority. He said\r\n“The removal of ideological warfare from\r\ninternational relations should usher in an era where\r\nhuman dignity becomes the fulcrum around which\r\nour commitment evolves.” (A/45/PV.1, p. 13)\r\nThe institution of democratic systems is a fragile and\r\npainful process. It requires sustenance. It certainly does\r\nnot deserve complacency. The changed environment has\r\nthoroughly affected the work of this Organization.\r\nPassivity, which often prevailed when crises threatened or\r\nundermined democracy, has been replaced by a\r\nreinvigorated United Nations commitment to act in a\r\nproactive manner. This qualitative change is having a\r\ndecisive impact. United Nations assistance in\r\ninstitution-building and election processes has proved\r\ncrucial in many new and emerging democracies.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nDemocracy enhances civil society through\r\nparticipation. Competing interests consolidate pluralism.\r\nFreedom of the media, independence of the judiciary, rule\r\nof law, free and fair periodic elections, accountability and\r\ntransparency are basic requirements for democratic\r\nsocieties. Equally important in ensuring stability is a social\r\nenvironment which enhances and promotes the dignity\r\nwhich is the inherent and inalienable right of all human\r\nbeings.\r\nLack of resources and development are not to be a\r\npretext for Governments to restrict or stifle human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms. But by their very nature,\r\npoverty, misery and want trample upon human dignity. This\r\nis why the call for solidarity by the developing world\r\nshould never go unheeded. Need generates tension and\r\ncarries the potential for strife, with consequences which are\r\nunfathomable. The challenges which face the new and\r\nemerging democracies are multiple. Pluralism is dependent\r\non the consolidation of tolerance and freedom of opinion.\r\nThe instances when the aspirations of those who struggled\r\nfor liberty have been thwarted by acts or waves of political\r\nor ethnic intolerance are disquieting.\r\nThe heritage of ideologies which ruled through\r\nimposition is another, but not the only, threat which the\r\nnew democracies face. Networks which operate in\r\ninternational drug trafficking, terrorism, illegal arms and the\r\ntransfer of nuclear materials not only exploit, but often\r\ncreate for themselves enclaves of vulnerability.\r\nThe assistance provided by the United Nations must\r\nnecessarily take into account all these areas. Efforts to\r\ndevelop and promote early-warning mechanisms, preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building\r\nare formidable and deserve praise and support. But they are\r\nnot the only areas that contribute towards the long-term\r\nenhancement and enjoyment of democratic rule. Institution-\r\nbuilding and capacity-building assistance which is\r\nmultiform is comprehensive and long-lasting.\r\nThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE) recognized from its inception the\r\ninseparable link between security, human rights and\r\neconomic cooperation. These are the three pillars which\r\nhelped the Conference survive the throes of the cold war.\r\nToday the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE), as successor of the Conference,\r\ncontinues to consolidate its work in all three fields.\r\nUndoubtedly, the work of the Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights in granting assistance in the\r\ndiverse areas relating to the holding and monitoring of\r\nelections is of key importance, as are its missions to areas\r\nof tension.\r\nEqually incisive on developments in Europe is the\r\nsterling work undertaken by the Council of Europe. That\r\nbastion of human rights during the cold war is today\r\nsharing its experience and expertise with its new and\r\nextended membership in an on-going experiment in\r\nmultinational democracy which is as unique as it is\r\ndiverse in the areas in which is operates.\r\nOne cannot but underline, at this point, the impact\r\nwhich the European Union’s resolve to translate words\r\ninto deeds has had on the consolidation of democracy, not\r\nonly in Europe but also in other regions. The continued\r\nengagement of the Union in the sponsorship of\r\nprogrammes in the fields of social and economic\r\ndevelopment is as important to the buttressing of\r\ndemocracy as are its aid programmes in education, health\r\nand institution-building.\r\nThe Maltese people have always been conscious of\r\nthe need to preserve and protect democracy. We have\r\ndefended our democratic convictions when endangered.\r\nSuch principles are worth safeguarding. Today we are\r\nreaping the fruit. Our experience bears witness to the\r\nbenefits of tolerance and freedom as these are reflected in\r\nthe steady pace of political, social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Managua Declaration and Plan of Action\r\nprovide a constant guideline in support of Governments\r\nfor the promotion and consolidation of new or restored\r\ndemocracies. Malta looks forward to the convening of a\r\nThird International Conference on New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, to take place in 1996 in Bucharest.\r\nDoubtless the people of Romania, who liberated\r\nthemselves from totalitarian rule with so much pain, will\r\nhave much to contribute to the constructive dialogue on\r\nthe problems and challenges to the new and emerging\r\ndemocracies.\r\nDemocracy guarantees the observance of\r\nfundamental human rights. It is built on the recognition of\r\nthe dignity of each member of society and imposes a\r\nsocial responsibility. Democracy should remain our\r\ngreatest legacy for future generations.\r\nMr. Erdös (Hungary) (interpretation from French):\r\nI am speaking as a sponsor of draft resolution A/50/L.19\r\nentitled “Support by the United Nations system of the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nefforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or\r\nrestored democracies” and also to express Hungary’s\r\nagreement with the statement by the representative of Spain\r\non behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe great political earthquakes which shook the\r\nbipolar world have buried it under the debris of totalitarian\r\nand authoritarian systems. Today, democracy reigns in a\r\nnumber of countries which, it is true, have different\r\napproaches and whose conditions vary considerably. What\r\nbinds them together, none the less, is a faith in democratic\r\nvalues, and in the pre-eminence and effectiveness of\r\nrepresentative democracy as a system of government.\r\nIn the United Nations, there is a notable gap in this\r\nregard, namely that the word “democracy” does not even\r\nappear in the text of the Charter, so that our basic\r\ndocument contains no reference to this concept. This shows\r\nhow far we have come since the creation of our world\r\nOrganization.\r\nNow that the euphoria resulting from the major\r\nchanges is behind us, we now face the unprecedented and\r\nsingularly difficult challenges of political and economic\r\ntransformation in countries which have chosen to become,\r\nor become once again, democratic. The Managua\r\nDeclaration adopted at the conclusion of the Second\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies\r\nin 1994 refers, quite rightly, to the obstacles facing those\r\ncountries. It would be a mistake to assume that there is an\r\nautomatic link between the dawning of an era of democracy\r\nand the success of the democratic enterprise. The path\r\nleading to the triumph of democracy in practice is fraught\r\nwith many difficulties and dangerous traps. International\r\nconferences on these issues, including the conference to be\r\nheld in Bucharest, are an opportunity for exchanging both\r\npositive and negative experiences on these issues amongst\r\na growing number of countries.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General contained in\r\ndocument A/50/332 focuses essentially on ways and means\r\nfor the United Nations to provide multifaceted assistance to\r\nthe efforts of Governments in that sphere. Such assistance\r\nshould be placed in the very complex everyday context of\r\nthose countries which are in the process of ridding\r\nthemselves of a heavy political, social and economic legacy.\r\nAll the activities that constitute this support from the United\r\nNations — the promotion of a democratic culture,\r\ninvolvement in assisting the electoral process and the\r\ncreation of democratic institutions — are taking place in the\r\nvery specific circumstances of the various countries, and\r\nthey are either facilitated or, made more difficult\r\ndepending on the particular situation.\r\nThe observations and recommendations made in the\r\nreport shed light on the real dimensions of this task by\r\nhighlighting the impossibility for the United Nations or\r\nfor Governments in today’s world to face the challenge of\r\ndemocratization alone. We would therefore have thought\r\nit desirable to give further emphasis to the importance of\r\nregional organizations, given the many partners involved,\r\nin efforts to advance the values and ideals of democracy.\r\nRegional organizations have a primordial role to play in\r\napplying the purposes and principles of the Charter to a\r\nspecific region, taking into account the region’s distinctive\r\nconditions.\r\nOne cannot forget that the historic changes of a few\r\nyears ago — those changes which finally, once and for\r\nall, sealed the fate of totalitarianism — actually took\r\nplace along a line of confrontation which kept Europe and\r\nthe entire world divided into two opposing ideological and\r\nmilitary camps for several decades. It was the collapse of\r\nthat physical and psychological separating wall that was\r\nthe decisive and determining moment in that process of\r\nchange.\r\nIn retrospect we must recognize the historic merits\r\nof the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe\r\n(CSCE), which in its time provoked processes within the\r\nclosed societies in the eastern part of the old continent\r\nwhich contributed greatly to the disappearance of the\r\ntotalitarian systems and to the colossal changes enacted in\r\nthose societies. Anyone who is at all familiar with the\r\nrecent history of that part of Europe will recall the impact\r\nwhich the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 had on the human\r\nrights and democratic rights situation and the rule of law\r\nin the States of Eastern Europe.\r\nMovements and individuals who dedicated\r\nthemselves to the struggle for democracy, human rights\r\nand basic freedoms drew inspiration from the documents\r\nof CSCE which, in turn, gave legitimacy to\r\nintergovernmental public debate on human rights\r\nproblems and humanitarian issues and thereby gave\r\nencouragement and protection to those organizations,\r\ngroups of individuals and citizens.\r\nToday, the Conference on Security and Co-operation\r\nin Europe, which has become the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) — a\r\nregional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter — brings together 54 countries, stretching from\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nKamtchatka to Alaska, which have subscribed to the\r\ndocuments of the Organization and which thereby proclaim\r\ntheir commitment to the democratic values that underlie the\r\nOSCE’s activities.\r\nThe OSCE, which has been able to adapt to today’s\r\nradically different circumstances, nevertheless warns us, in\r\nthe Declaration adopted at the Summit of Heads of State\r\nand Government held in Budapest last December, against\r\ntaking a simplistic view of what remains to be done. The\r\ndocument emphasizes that the path to stable democracy, an\r\nefficient market economy and social justice is a hard one.\r\nThe document recalls that the spread of freedoms has been\r\naccompanied by new conflicts and the revival of old ones,\r\nthat human rights are still being flouted, that intolerance\r\npersists and discrimination against minorities is still\r\npractised. The document points out that the plagues of\r\naggressive nationalism, racism, chauvinism, xenophobia,\r\nanti-Semitism and ethnic tension are still widespread, and\r\nthat, along with social and economic instability, they are\r\namong the main sources of crisis, loss of life and of human\r\nmisery. This is compounded, according to the document, by\r\nthe threat of terrorism that haunts our societies. The\r\nSummit document reconfirms the determination of the\r\nOSCE to combat terrorism and its commitment to enhanced\r\ncooperation to eliminate this threat to security, democracy\r\nand human rights.\r\nFollowing this decision taken at the highest level,\r\nOSCE has committed itself to broadening its\r\nmultidimensional activities in conflict situations within the\r\nOSCE region. In so doing it is guided by its global concept\r\nof security and its indivisibility, a concept which, above and\r\nbeyond the security aspect, also has economic, social and\r\nhumanitarian aspects. Respect for democracy and the rule\r\nof law represents an essential component of OSCE\r\nactivities with regard to security and cooperation, and it\r\nmust remain a primary objective.\r\nFor several years there has already existed within the\r\norganization an appropriate body through which it can\r\nbetter meet the requirements of our times. The office for\r\ndemocratic institutions and human rights, whose\r\nheadquarters are in Warsaw, will henceforth have greater\r\nresources, pursuant to the decisions of the OSCE Summit,\r\nand will continue to help participating States, in particular\r\nthose in transition.\r\nThere are approximately 20 countries in the OSCE\r\nregion — with, to be sure, very specific situations, ranging\r\nfrom the shores of the Baltic Sea to the mountains of\r\nCentral Asia — which belong to this category of States in\r\ntransition. In other words, these are countries which\r\nrecently have chosen, in different ways, to establish or\r\nrestore democracy and which are making progress — with\r\nvarying degrees of success, we must admit — from\r\ntotalitarianism to democracy. The OSCE missions which\r\nare present in a large number of areas of the region are,\r\namong other things, actively promoting the rule of law,\r\nwithout which we could not credibly envisage the\r\nsettlement of conflicts, mostly internal ones, which are\r\ncausing upheavals in a number of these countries.\r\nIn this context, one of the greatest challenges facing\r\nthe OSCE is its participation in the implementation of a\r\nfuture agreement on the settlement of the crisis in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand in Croatia. The specific contribution which the OSCE\r\ncan make to this broad-based operation, in the light of the\r\nexperience it has already gained, includes the creation or\r\nrestoration of democratic institutions, assistance in the\r\nreturn of refugees and displaced persons, verification of\r\nrespect for human rights, including the rights of\r\nminorities, and electoral assistance. This contribution of\r\nthe OSCE will also include measures to be taken in arms\r\ncontrol and disarmament, as well as in the post-conflict\r\nprocess of economic and social recovery.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that the main message of\r\nthe draft resolution submitted to this Assembly is that the\r\nUnited Nations must continue its action for\r\ndemocratization now under way in a large number of\r\ncountries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. This\r\naction is absolutely necessary because there is an\r\nindissoluble link between the flourishing of democracy,\r\non the one hand, and stability and security in specific\r\ncountries and in entire regions, on the other. In this\r\nregard, we believe that the fundamental relationship that\r\nexists between peace, development and democracy should\r\nbe better highlighted in our world Organization.\r\nRegarding the governmental level, where we will\r\nfind the major protagonists for the action envisaged by\r\ndraft resolution A/50/L.19, the United Nations and its\r\nregional organizations, as well as other multilateral\r\ninstitutions, must stand ready to support and sustain, in\r\nthe most appropriate manner, the efforts — not always\r\neasily exerted — of Governments to achieve the\r\ndemocratic development of their countries.\r\nMr. Gorita (Romania): Last year, Romania\r\nwholeheartedly welcomed the inclusion in the agenda of\r\nthe General Assembly of the new item entitled “Support\r\nby the United Nations system of the efforts of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or restored\r\ndemocracies”. The attempt to assess this rather new\r\ndimension of the work of the United Nations was\r\nsuccessful.\r\nProof of this is not only the unanimous approval of the\r\nfirst resolution ever adopted on such a matter, but also the\r\nincreasing interest of Member States in this topic. During\r\nthe general debate of the present session and the Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting, numerous delegations offered\r\ntheir views on the importance and impact of their\r\ndemocratization efforts and shared their national\r\nexperiences. In the same context, the excellent report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/50/332) provides useful conceptual\r\nclarifications and sheds more light on the actual\r\nachievements of the United Nations system in this field. We\r\nare convinced that this is just a beginning and that the\r\nSecretary-General, in concert with Member States, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other international\r\nprotagonists, will find new ideas and more avenues to\r\nexplore.\r\nThe representative of Spain delivered a comprehensive\r\nstatement on behalf of the European Union and Associated\r\nStates, including Romania. My delegation fully subscribes\r\nto the contents of that statement. I would like to add a few\r\ncomments of particular interest to my Government.\r\nMy delegation sincerely believes that the support by\r\nour universal Organization of the promotion and\r\nconsolidation of democracy is useful and timely and\r\ndeserves special attention — for a number of reasons.\r\nFirst, the growing trend towards democracy, political\r\npluralism and the rule of law favours a genuine exercise of\r\nthe sovereignty of peoples, respect and protection of human\r\nrights, and the fostering of a social environment aimed at\r\nthe adequate human development of individuals and\r\nnations.\r\nSecondly, the economic and social development of\r\nnations can best be achieved by democracy on the basis of\r\nparticipation and consultation of the people in the process\r\nof governing. It provides lines of accountability and\r\npermanent control over the performance of Governments\r\nfor the benefit of the whole society.\r\nThirdly, a powerful and active civil society is essential\r\nto maintain a proper democratic government, to correct any\r\ntendency towards abuses of power, to promote and ensure\r\npluralism, civil liberties and opportunities for all.\r\nFourthly, democracy offers the means to\r\npermanently seek good governance — one more\r\nresponsive to the challenges of economic and social\r\ndevelopments and to the needs of the governed.\r\nDemocracy is not utopia, but it has proved itself able to\r\nproduce tangible results.\r\nFifthly, sharing democratic values is of crucial\r\nimportance for the political, economic and social\r\nprocesses in national societies, as well as for international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIt seems to us that democracy is not a dogma, but an\r\nopen, dynamic and self-perfectible system. Democracy in\r\nitself means profound diversity and variety of expression.\r\nWhen we consider the “geography of democratization”, as\r\nthe European Union put it, we notice how specific the\r\nneeds and the priorities of each society can be.\r\nAt the same time, we are aware that effective\r\ndemocracy should lead to the real development and\r\nprosperity of the peoples that democracy is supposed to\r\nserve. Likewise, development without democracy is\r\nimpaired if it benefits only a few of the elites. That is\r\nwhy the assertion that democracy, development and\r\nrespect for human rights are interlinked and mutually\r\nreinforcing is so valid. Their harmonization naturally\r\nimplies a positive impact on international peace and\r\nsecurity and on our society of nations. In this light, an\r\nactive and stimulating role of the United Nations once\r\nagain appears welcome.\r\nWith all its merits, consistent progress in\r\ndemocratization cannot be taken for granted.\r\nDemocracy-making is a painful process which may not be\r\nirreversible if it is not backed continuously. Here again,\r\nthe United Nations, faithful to the sacred spirit of the\r\nCharter, is expected to voice its moral support and to give\r\nits concrete assistance. The aim of the draft resolution\r\nbefore us is merely to confirm this need, and we hope it\r\nwill be approved by consensus.\r\nFinally, since Romania will host the next\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, I would like to assure the Assembly that\r\nmy Government will do its utmost to make this meeting\r\na politically significant event. In order to achieve this, we\r\nshall rely on the support of and ideas from any interested\r\nMember States. We believe that the Conference in\r\nBucharest will be, indeed, a new and valuable opportunity\r\nfor a broad exchange of views on such a topical issue.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nWe are confident that it will add substantial value to the\r\ndebate in, and action by, the United Nations system.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): My delegation welcomes\r\nthe opportunity to address this Assembly on the agenda\r\nitem entitled ”Support by the United Nations system of the\r\nefforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or\r\nrestored democracies”. This discussion is taking place at a\r\ntime when peace is an essential commodity in the world.\r\nThe agenda item urges the United Nations to support efforts\r\nby Member States in the quest for restoration and\r\nconsolidation of democracy. To that end, In doing so, my\r\ndelegation wishes to appeal to the United Nations to\r\ncontinue instilling a sense of respect for the sovereignty of\r\nStates, so that there is continued appreciation of the\r\ndifferent approaches to democracy.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland could not remain\r\nuntouched by the wind of democratic dispensation which\r\nstarted blowing in the early 1990s. Our approach, however,\r\nwas determined by the entire Swazi nation, which made its\r\ncontributions at various grass-root forums. The Swazi\r\nnation agreed that it preferred the type of democracy that is\r\nhomegrown and reflective of its culture and national\r\ncircumstances. To this end, I am gratified to inform the\r\nAssembly that our unique way of democracy has received\r\npopular support from the international community,\r\nincluding world capitals, from which financial assistance for\r\nour democracy is still pouring in today.\r\nMay I, at this juncture, briefly describe how we elect\r\nour parliamentary representatives. Our system is divided\r\ninto primary and secondary stages. From the primary stage,\r\nthe system affords all the cross-sections of our populace an\r\nopportunity to nominate an electoral candidate. This takes\r\nplace in each and every chiefdom. This procedure is\r\ninclusive of all registered voters — as opposed to the party\r\nsystem, whereby the executive decides on behalf of the\r\nentire nation on the nomination of candidates. This primary\r\nstage is followed by the secondary stage, whereby\r\nparliamentary representatives are elected through the direct\r\nand secret ballot.\r\nOur unique system is reflective of the key variables\r\nand characteristics of democracy, such as election through\r\nsecret ballot, voters’ roll, transparency and accountability to\r\nthe electorate. In all these efforts, we shall continue to\r\nenlist the support of the United Nations and that of\r\ndeveloped Member States. I hasten to say that the United\r\nNations has, through the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) Office in Swaziland, lived up to the\r\nletter of this agenda item by providing financial assistance\r\nduring our last general elections.\r\nHaving said all this, my delegation wishes to appeal\r\nto the Members of the United Nations to appreciate the\r\nmanner in which States such as the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland approach the issue of democracy. In doing so,\r\nwe shall be able to emulate what is good in other States\r\nand to incorporate it in our respective political situations.\r\nThis may, further, make it possible to realize that\r\ndemocracy cannot be imported from certain quarters of\r\nthe globe, but, rather, is an internal evolutionary process\r\nreflective of national experiences and cultures.\r\nWe, the developing nations, have been unfortunate\r\nfor too long. After the end of the Second World War, in\r\n1945, political ideologies were introduced and imposed on\r\nus by those countries that found them fit for their national\r\nprestige and glory. What subsequently happened to those\r\nideologies should be sending the clear message to us,\r\nespecially the developing nations, that any democracy\r\nfounded on foreign principles ends in a fiasco, thus\r\nresulting in national crises and confusion.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that all\r\ndemocracies, regardless of where they originate, are in\r\npursuit of a very persuasive ideal: democracy. Many\r\nwars — national and regional — are waged in the name\r\nand defence of democracy. Perhaps I may venture here to\r\nillustrate the kind of democracy generally needed by the\r\npeople: an autochthonous system, the desire to see the\r\nsystem enjoy popular participation, and participation\r\nthrough elected representatives.\r\nThe idea of direct participation was first introduced\r\nby the Greek city-States. I have no doubt that such a\r\nsystem must have been in the formative stages of\r\nparticipation in matters of government and was a process\r\nof development that was to result in the concept of\r\nrepresentativity in Greece. However, I wish to emphasize\r\nat this point that other parts of the world took different\r\napproaches to democracy, and that the Greeks did not,\r\nand could never, punish those nations for innovations of\r\ndemocracy. Instead, they were prepared to learn from\r\nthese innovations. Even the oldest types of democracy,\r\nwhich have undergone some trials, cannot, in our view,\r\nbe world models.\r\nDifferent methods of acquiring parliamentary\r\nrepresentation have been adopted by various nations.\r\nThese have proved to work well if they are reflective of\r\nnational circumstances, which are the essential building\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 10 November 1995\r\nblocks of true democracy. In some cases, there are single-\r\nparty methods; in others, there is multi-party democracy; in\r\nyet others, there are no parties at all. Democracy can\r\ntherefore be regarded as the vehicle that conveys\r\ncommodities to the people.\r\nIn some States, a government is appointed by the\r\nHead of State; it is not chosen from among elected\r\nparliamentary representatives. Here again, this can work\r\nwell subject to the constitution and to national\r\ncircumstances.\r\nIn the light of everything that I have said, it becomes\r\nclear that the United Nations has a duty to encourage\r\nMember States to respect other nations’ approaches to the\r\nprinciple of democracy. Therefore, it remains the\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations to discourage certain\r\nStates from being armchair critics without appreciating\r\nthe attendant national circumstances. So serious is the\r\nsituation that certain developed countries withhold their\r\nfinancial assistance for development under the pretext that\r\nthe developing nations fall short of the yardstick of\r\ndemocracy as perceived by those developed countries.\r\nIn conclusion, let it be put on record that through a\r\ncontinued sharing of ideas and experiences the principle\r\nof democracy will continue to thrive and to sustain the\r\nnew or restored democracies until they attain a stage of\r\nmaturity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
