(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Pibulsonggram\r\n(Thailand), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 41 (continued)\r\nSupport by the United Nations system of the efforts of\r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or\r\nrestored democracies\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/50/332 and\r\nCorr. 1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/50/L.19)\r\nMr. Ayalon (Israel): At the outset I wish to express\r\nmy delegation’s appreciation for the sympathy extended to\r\nus by the President, as well as by Member States, in the\r\nwake of last week’s assassination of the Prime Minister of\r\nIsrael, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin. To everyone concerned we say:\r\n“The State of Israel is heartened by your words and your\r\nactions.”\r\nWe are pleased to see that a growing number of States\r\nare recognizing the fundamental relationship between\r\ndemocracy, development, peace, security and respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nDemocratization is not only a moral issue. It is tied\r\ndirectly to the establishment of peace and stability. The\r\nexistence of a democratic government is the central\r\nguarantee for preventing policies of violence and\r\naggression. This stems from its very nature, which places\r\npeople’s destinies in their own hands and is attentive to\r\nthe people’s yearnings for peace and prosperity.\r\nIsrael is still mourning the death of Prime Minister\r\nYitzhak Rabin, whose life was tragically cut short by an\r\nassassin’s bullet. Sadly, political assassinations still occur.\r\nAssassination favours no specific system of government;\r\nbullets do not differentiate between democrats and\r\ndictators. Democracies, however, are best equipped to\r\ndeal with such despicable acts. In States such as Israel,\r\nwhere the rule of democratic law is firmly entrenched and\r\nits values and traditions are enshrined, there is a smooth\r\nand orderly transition from one leader to another, even\r\nduring times of acute emergencies and crises. My\r\ndelegation is proud of the strength that Israeli democracy\r\nhas exhibited through these difficult times. We remain\r\ncommitted to the pursuit of democracy and the peace\r\nprocess that our late Prime Minister championed.\r\nThe fact that a growing number of countries are\r\nembracing democratic principles is one of the most\r\npromising developments of our time. But we must not\r\ngrow complacent. Democracies are still a minority among\r\nUnited Nations Member States, and the dangers they face\r\nfrom within and from without are still formidable. The\r\nprocess of democratization is a long one that must be\r\nnurtured and protected in order to bear fruit. It is\r\ndependent upon courageous leadership and the\r\ndevelopment of grass-roots support. Openness and\r\nparticipation by people from all walks of life encourage\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nsustainable development. Democratic societies produce\r\npluralistic, free market and enterprising economies. As a\r\nresult, they enjoy the highest standard of living in the\r\nworld.\r\nFor these reasons, it is appropriate for the United\r\nNations to support the efforts of the Governments of the\r\nnew or restored democracies. The international community\r\nshould promote the development of democratic political\r\ncultures by instilling democratic values in the people, and\r\nespecially in the young. Education for democracy should be\r\na never ending process that encourages citizens to be\r\ninformed and active participants in the noble task of\r\ngovernment. This year experts from Israel held seminars on\r\neducation for democratic elections in Nicaragua and\r\nGuatemala. Later this month Israel will be hosting a\r\nseminar on the role of labour unions in the transition to a\r\nfree market economy. Next month another seminar to be\r\nheld in Israel will deal with development and nurturing\r\ndemocracy through grass-roots organizations, with\r\nparticipants from 25 countries. For 1996 we are planning\r\nsimilar programmes for participants from all over the\r\nworld.\r\nEconomic and humanitarian assistance is also crucial\r\nto buttress democratic reforms and to ensure the viability of\r\nyoung democratic institutions. We are certain that the report\r\nof the Secretary-General, submitted to the General\r\nAssembly at this fiftieth session, will be given the highest\r\npriority and attention.\r\nIn the past year alone we have contributed to several\r\nfunds: those for victims of torture, for humanitarian causes\r\nin Rwanda and Yugoslavia, for the war crimes Tribunal in\r\nAbkhazia and for clearing minefields in Cambodia.\r\nOur promotion of democracy is not limited to\r\ncharitable contributions. Israel is pleased to have co-\r\nsponsored a number of resolutions in this session\r\nsupporting democratization. We view this as an expression\r\nof the importance we attach to the issue, as well as a signal\r\nof our readiness to cooperate with the international\r\ncommunity in providing assistance to new and restored\r\ndemocracies throughout the world. Accordingly, we endorse\r\nthe Nicaraguan initiative, and co-sponsor this draft\r\nresolution to support new or restored democracies. We look\r\nforward to its adoption by consensus.\r\nMrs. Klein-Loemban Tobing (Suriname): The\r\nRepublic of Suriname is, as it was last year, one of the\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution on support by the United\r\nNations system of the efforts of Governments to promote\r\nand consolidate new or restored democracies, which this\r\nyear is contained in document A/50/L.19.\r\nIn the short history of Suriname as an independent\r\nnation, the democratic process has been interrupted at\r\nleast twice. These interruptions have inflicted great pain\r\nand losses upon the Surinamese people. Having gone\r\nthrough difficult years, Suriname is now on the road,\r\nadmittedly not an easy one, to establish a stable and fully\r\nfledged democracy.\r\nWhile on this road the Surinamese people have\r\nexperienced the value and impact of international\r\nsolidarity. In organizing our renewed expressions of\r\nfreedom and democracy, we have received inestimable\r\nencouragement and political support. Countries like my\r\nown, in which democracy was interrupted and now has\r\nbeen restored, should be supported. This support is critical\r\nin order to countervail the internal and external forces that\r\nendanger our emerging democracies.\r\nThe delegation of Suriname attaches great\r\nimportance to the Managua Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction, as adopted by the Second International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, held from\r\n4 to 6 July 1994 in Nicaragua.\r\nThe participants at that Conference agreed, within a\r\ntrue partnership of democratic nations, to exert themselves\r\nto the utmost to serve peace, democracy and security and\r\nto continue their efforts to create an environment in which\r\nthe necessary democratic processes can be developed —\r\nan environment in which the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”, as basic instruments for the consolidation\r\nof democracy, can be implemented.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposal to convene a\r\nThird International Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, to be held in 1996 in Bucharest. It will\r\nprovide us with an opportunity to evaluate the results of\r\nthe implementation of the Managua Declaration and Plan\r\nof Action.\r\nThe great efforts of the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies to support and assist new and\r\nrestored democracies have recently become evident in my\r\ncountry through the organization of a seminar on\r\n“Strengthening democracy”. This seminar, held from\r\n30 June to 2 July 1995, was organized by the National\r\nAssembly of Suriname, the Parliamentarians for Global\r\nAction and the United Nations Development Programme\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\n(UNDP). About 90 representatives of governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, human rights, religious,\r\nyouth and women’s organizations, political parties, trade\r\nunions, educational institutions, the media, the police force\r\nof Suriname, private enterprises, and the Pan American\r\nHealth Organization (PAHO) participated in the seminar.\r\nDuring the seminar on “Strengthening democracy”, the\r\nSurinamese people again stressed their firm belief in\r\ndemocracy and the democratic institutions as the only basis\r\nfor progress, peace and social well-being. At the seminar,\r\na resolution was adopted in which the participants ensure\r\nfuture cooperation towards: promoting equality between\r\nmen and women through their equal participation at all\r\nlevels of political and public life, combating legal\r\ninequalities and violence in the family, and striving for\r\nmutual respect among members of the family, using, among\r\nothers, the standards laid down in pertinent international\r\nconventions and agreements; secondly, developing strong\r\nlinks between the democratic institutions of Suriname, the\r\norganizations that make up its civil society, and the\r\ninternational community; thirdly, increasing the\r\nsocioeconomic development of Suriname, which is central\r\nto fostering a lasting democratic political culture in the\r\ncountry; and fourthly, fostering respect for the rule of law,\r\nthe constitution and the democratic institutions and\r\nprocedures that it establishes.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to thank the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized organizations and\r\nagencies for the important contributions they have made\r\ntowards the consolidation of democracy in Suriname. With\r\nthe general elections — to be held next year — in sight, it\r\nwill be of the utmost importance to have the continued\r\nattention and support of the international community, in\r\norder to consolidate the Surinamese democracy and its\r\ndemocratic institutions and so to protect and consolidate\r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the representative of Yemen has asked to\r\nparticipate in the debate on this item.\r\nInasmuch as the list of speakers was closed on Friday,\r\n10 November, in the morning, may I ask the Assembly\r\nwhether there is any objection to the inclusion of this\r\ndelegation in the list of speakers?There is none. Yemen is\r\ntherefore included in the list.\r\nMrs. Moutoussamy-Ashe (United States of America):\r\nThe United States is pleased to address the issues raised\r\nunder the agenda item entitled “Support by the United\r\nNations system of the efforts of Governments to promote\r\nand consolidate new or restored democracies”. The\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights recognized\r\nthat\r\n“Democracy, development and respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms are\r\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. Democracy\r\nis based on the freely expressed will of the people to\r\ndetermine their own political, economic, social and\r\ncultural systems and their full participation in all\r\naspects of their lives”. (A/CONF.157/23, para. 8)\r\nBearing this in mind, we welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on support for new or restored\r\ndemocracies. We have noted with interest and\r\nappreciation the section covering assistance the United\r\nNations system is providing for institution-building,\r\nparticularly in the areas of creating and strengthening\r\ndemocratic structures of government, enhancing the rule\r\nof law, and improving accountability, transparency and\r\nquality in public sector management. We strongly agree\r\nthat the Secretariat and the United Nations agencies\r\nshould increase cooperation in the area of institution-\r\nbuilding and governance, in particular through\r\nstrengthening capacity-building of democratic institutions.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report accurately states that\r\nthe challenge of democratization in today’s world cannot\r\nbe met by the United Nations system or by Governments\r\nalone, although the latter remain the principal actors.\r\nRegional organizations, non-governmental organizations\r\nand trade unions, to name a few, share the responsibilities\r\nof building democratic societies. And around the world,\r\nit is ordinary citizens who are doing the hard, sometimes\r\npainful work of building democratic societies from the\r\nbottom up. They are making democracy work not just on\r\nelection day, but every day. They are promoting civil\r\nsocieties that respect the rule of law and make\r\nGovernments accountable.\r\nMany young democracies contend with the vast\r\nproblems of grinding poverty, illiteracy, rapid population\r\ngrowth, and malnutrition. The survival of these\r\ndemocracies may ultimately depend on their ability to\r\nshow their citizens that democracy can deliver — that the\r\ndifficult political and economic choices will pay off soon,\r\nand not just in some distant future. But nations that free\r\nhuman potential, that invest in human capital and defend\r\nhuman rights, have a better chance to develop and grow.\r\nAs President Clinton has stated:\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\n“Democracies do not wage war against one another;\r\nthey make better partners in trade and diplomacy; and,\r\ndespite their inherent problems, they offer the best\r\nguarantee for the protection of human rights.”\r\nThe United States welcomes the challenges raised in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on support for new and\r\nrestored democracies, and we look forward to continuing to\r\nwork with the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations to develop the public and private institutions\r\nessential to a working democracy and the rule of law.\r\nMr. Ziauddin (Bangladesh): Bangladesh was happy\r\nto participate in the Second International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies, held in Managua from 4 to\r\n6 July 1994, and was party to the Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction adopted by the Conference. We therefore welcomed\r\nand endorsed the inscription on the agenda of the item\r\nentitled “Support by the United Nations system of the\r\nefforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or\r\nrestored democracies”. We also fully supported General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/30 of 7 December 1994.\r\nIt therefore goes without saying that my delegation\r\nstrongly supports the continuing involvement of the United\r\nNations system, and, indeed, the international community,\r\nindividually and collectively, in supporting efforts of\r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate democracy. In this\r\nregard, we take particular cognisance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s caveat that the United Nations system\r\n“does not endorse or promote any specific form of\r\ngovernment”\r\nand that\r\n“Democracy is not a model to be copied from certain\r\nStates, but a goal to be attained by all people and\r\nassimilated by all cultures.” (A/50/332, para. 5)\r\nHe goes on to refer to democratization as:\r\n“a process by which an authoritarian society becomes\r\nincreasingly participatory through such mechanisms as\r\nperiodic elections to representative bodies, the\r\naccountability of public officials, a transparent public\r\nadministration, an independent judiciary and a free\r\npress. It is inherent in this concept that\r\ndemocratization does not necessarily lead immediately\r\nto a fully democratic society. That goal may be\r\nattained only in steps, with an authoritarian society\r\ngradually becoming less so.” (A/50/332, para. 6)\r\nWe fully agree with this view.\r\nA factor of pre-eminent importance that Bangladesh\r\nwould like to stress is that democracy is not only a\r\nsustained process, but provides the only long-term and\r\nsustainable route to successful development. Democracy\r\nand development are integrally interlinked. Just as nations\r\nhave a responsibility to promote better standards of living\r\nas the essential base for restoring democracy, so the\r\ninternational community must provide a more conducive\r\nexternal environment through trade, investment and the\r\ntransfer of technology. Furthermore, Bangladesh fully\r\nsupports as relevant the essential premise of the Managua\r\nDeclaration that the democratic process and democratic\r\nprogress in our countries should not occur in isolation, but\r\nmust be provided with an avenue for continuous\r\ncommunication and contact.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary General’s comprehensive\r\nreport pursuant to resolution 49/30, which remains a\r\nuseful compendium of actual and potential areas of\r\nsupport for the democratization process by the United\r\nNations system. We have taken specific cognisance of his\r\nobservation and recommendations relating to electoral\r\nassistance; the role of international observers; means of\r\nensuring the durability of the democratization process;\r\nadministrative aspects of governance; cooperation in\r\ninstitution-building and in such key areas of involvement\r\nas the strengthening of leadership skills and political\r\ninstitutions; support for effective judiciaries to guarantee\r\nthe rule of law and protection of human rights; and the\r\nstrengthening of linkages between government and civil\r\nsociety through non-governmental organizations, the\r\nmedia, local government and professional associations and\r\nthrough decentralization. Through support for democratic\r\nstructures and forms of government and a smooth\r\ncontinuum from relief to sustainable development, secure\r\nand solid foundations for peace, democratization and\r\ndevelopment can be achieved. The entire process requires\r\na multiplicity of partners working towards\r\ndemocratization.\r\nWe therefore support the draft resolution now before\r\nus and call on the Secretary-General to present a report to\r\nthe General Assembly, at its next session, on the\r\nimplementation of the present draft resolution, including\r\nways and means to enable the Organization to respond\r\neffectively and in an integrated manner to requests from\r\nMember States for assistance in this field.\r\nMy delegation believes that in the wake of the\r\nimportant Third International Conference of New or\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nRestored Democracies, scheduled to be held in Bucharest\r\nin 1996, and the General Assembly resolutions, the\r\nconcerns of countries with new or restored democracies will\r\nbe kept under scrutiny on a continuous basis.\r\nMr. Domingo (Philippines): The Philippines joins our\r\nbrother delegations in supporting draft resolution A/50/L.19,\r\nwhich aims to move forward the initiative expressed in last\r\nyear’s consensus resolution 49/30. Like many other\r\ndelegations, we also appreciate the Secretary General’s\r\nreport on United Nations efforts to assist, at the request of\r\nMember States, in their democratization. We believe,\r\nhowever, that there is a need to intensify and optimize\r\nUnited Nations efforts.\r\nAs noted both by the First International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies, which was held in Manila\r\nin 1988, and by the Second International Conference, held\r\nin Managua in 1994, many problems, both internal and\r\nexternal, assail new and restored democracies. The national\r\neuphoria resulting from the overthrow of a tyrannic\r\ndictatorship or from a deliberate choice, through legal\r\nprocesses, to change a form of government is, in most\r\ncases, as we have observed in the last few years, soon\r\ndissipated by a realization that making a democracy work\r\nis not as easy as proclaiming a democratic Government.\r\nInternally, there are forces of the “left” and of the\r\n“right” which tend to destabilize Governments. Leftist\r\nforces seek to give more privileges, rights and benefits to\r\nmasses of people who seem to be left behind — justly or\r\nunjustly — in the political, social and economic adjustment\r\nprocesses. Rightist forces suspect anarchy in adjustment\r\nprocesses and seek to strengthen unduly the powers of\r\ngovernment in order to maintain order where national\r\ndiscipline seems lacking. In many instances, minorities\r\nwithin the body politic, encouraged by the prevailing spirit\r\nof democratization, strive for recognition of their identity at\r\nthe expense of national unity and integrity.\r\nExternally, new and restored democracies — often\r\nconstrained by mistakes or by habits from a long heritage\r\nof State-controlled economies — find it difficult to compete\r\nwith countries experienced in capitalistic free trade. Thus,\r\nthere is a need for new and restored democracies to be\r\nhelped, both by sympathetic and friendly countries that are\r\naware of the difficulties they face and by international\r\norganizations, like the United Nations, which could assist\r\ntechnically and financially in helping democratizing States\r\nachieve stability and self-reliance.\r\nNot far beyond the immediate adjustment needs of\r\nnew and restored democracies is the need for\r\ndevelopment. The linkage of development with democracy\r\nshould be obvious. Development fosters that domestic\r\nstability which is a sine qua non for democracy, as well\r\nas international peace and security - the requisite\r\nenvironment for the nurturing of democracy. It is thus\r\nimportant for the United Nations — an Organization\r\ncommitted to the\r\n“prevention and removal of threats to peace”\r\n— to support the efforts of Governments to\r\n“promote and consolidate new or restored\r\ndemocracies”.\r\nUnited Nations support for democratic and\r\ndemocratizing Governments should be based on the faith\r\nof its founding fathers\r\n“in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and\r\nworth of the human person, in the equal rights of\r\nmen and women and of nations large and small”,\r\nwhich are elements essential to a democracy.\r\nI should like to reiterate what the Philippine\r\ndelegation said last year on this point. United Nations\r\nsupport, to be effective and durable, should be based on\r\nserious study of the scope of support, of ways and means\r\nto achieve objectives, as well as of Organization-wide\r\nacceptance of the objectives and the means. What, in\r\nconcrete terms, can the United Nations do? What, in\r\nconcrete terms, can it not do or should it not do?\r\nThus, the Philippines sees the value of the operative\r\nparagraph of the draft resolution requesting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit a report to the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on innovative ways and means to\r\nenable the Organization, in support of the efforts of\r\nGovernments, as requested by Member States, to respond\r\neffectively and in an integrated manner.\r\nIn order that the Secretary-General’s study may be\r\nproperly appreciated by the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, the General Assembly should include in\r\nthe agenda of its fifty-first session an item entitled\r\n“Support by the United Nations system for the efforts of\r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or restored\r\ndemocracies”.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nThe Conference of New or Restored Democracies was\r\nfirst held in Manila in 1988, moved to Latin America in\r\n1994 and will be held in Europe — in Bucharest — next\r\nyear. The whole world is interested in, and concerned\r\nabout, the aspirations to and problems of democratization.\r\nMany countries seek United Nations assistance for their\r\nefforts to practise democracy. We hope that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report and its early discussion by the General\r\nAssembly will serve as an important input to the Third\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies.\r\nNew and restored democracies are becoming a very\r\nrelevant force in today’s world. May they continue to grow\r\nand thrive in their democratic way of life, for the peace and\r\nsecurity of the entire world.\r\nMr. Cárdenas (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation is particularly pleased to speak on\r\nthis agenda item, concerning the support by the United\r\nNations system for the efforts of Governments to promote\r\nand consolidate new or restored democracies.\r\nAs the Heads of State or Government declared at the\r\nlatest Ibero-American Summit held in my country last\r\nmonth, democracy, respect for human rights and respect for\r\nthe fundamental freedoms of the human person are essential\r\nvalues for our peoples. These three values, whose defence\r\nis of great importance to our country, are three central\r\npillars of the modern State, necessarily affecting the\r\nprosperity and stability of our societies.\r\nDemocracy is undoubtedly the best system of\r\ngovernment for proper channelling of the popular will. It\r\nproduces Governments with a mandate — a mandate to\r\nwhose fulfilment those Governments must be unshakeably\r\ncommitted. If they act honestly and effectively they are\r\nrewarded at the ballot box. The democratic process also\r\nmakes it possible to correct abuses and to eliminate\r\ncorruption or arbitrary action by the powerful, who are\r\ninexorably replaced when the people lose trust in them.\r\nLatin America was plagued by totalitarian regimes for\r\na number of decades. However, in recent years, in the new\r\ninternational situation, a growing number of countries have\r\nadopted and recognized democracy as the best system of\r\ngovernment. There have been many elections in the region,\r\nproducing general expressions of commitment to democracy\r\nand creating new areas of peace and dialogue, which are\r\nessential for development, something that is urgently\r\nneeded in our countries.\r\nIn the framework of democracy and the freedom that\r\nit guarantees, initiative flourishes and political and\r\neconomic freedom results in increased opportunities. This\r\nis not just a romantic idea; the practical lesson of history\r\nis that oppression and authoritarianism always come to an\r\nend by making insecure the very regimes that they\r\nsupport.\r\nThe modern concept of development is based on\r\nthese freedoms, but also on the responsibilities of the\r\nState, representing society, which must guarantee respect\r\nfor individual freedoms and must strengthen the system\r\nitself.\r\nRespect for individual freedoms, human rights,\r\nfreedom of expression, tolerance, respect for justice: these\r\nare all values that are established slowly — slowly by\r\ncomparison with the speed with which totalitarian regimes\r\nusually seize their illegitimate power. Thus, countries that\r\nenjoy democracy today have an unavoidable duty to\r\npromote it where it does not exist and to renew their full\r\nsupport for the consolidation of transitional processes.\r\nThat is why my country is represented here today,\r\njust as it was in Managua last year at the Second\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies, speaking in support of this objective, which\r\nis a matter of priority for us. The United Nations, under\r\nits Charter, has a historic responsibility to help\r\nconsolidate new democracies and prevent any return to\r\nanachronistic systems of oppression.\r\nFor these reasons, my country, with total conviction,\r\nhas no hesitation in endorsing and co-sponsoring the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Pirozhkov (Ukraine) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The process of moving towards a democratic\r\nsociety, engaged in by many States which have taken the\r\nroad of renewal and progress, is gaining the recognition\r\nand support of the world community. We can say without\r\nexaggeration that this is a dominant trend in the\r\ndevelopment of world civilization on the eve of the third\r\nmillennium, and there is no doubt that it will intensify in\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nIn this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, the delegation of Ukraine reiterates the high\r\nvalue that it attaches to the Organization’s multifaceted\r\nactivities in the areas of peace-keeping and conflict-\r\nprevention, help for the poor and the unfortunate and\r\nefforts to unite countries and peoples on the basis of the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nprinciples of democracy, justice and progress. Within these\r\nextensive activities, support for the initiatives of the\r\nInternational Conferences of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies — the first of which was held in Manila in\r\n1989, and the second in Managua in 1994 — constitutes a\r\nnew and important trend.\r\nWe can observe with satisfaction that, for many new\r\nStates that emerged at the end of the twentieth century, the\r\nSecretary-General’s interesting and comprehensive report on\r\nthis subject clarified mechanisms for the practical\r\nrealization of the principles and strategy involved in the\r\ncreation of a modern civil society. Moreover, the types of\r\ninteraction between international organizations and national\r\nStates in respect of democratic changes in individual States\r\nthat are engulfed in civil war and have deeply rooted\r\nauthoritarian traditions have become clearer. This aspect of\r\nthe activities of the United Nations system requires special\r\nattention and demands respect for the peoples of the new\r\nStates, where the democratic process is still very fragile and\r\nis only now being put on a solid foundation.\r\nAs a newly sovereign State, Ukraine is entirely at one\r\nwith the new or restored democracies, which have actively\r\ndeclared their commitment to democratic choice and have\r\nbroadened participation to large segments of their\r\npopulations in the processes of social, political and\r\neconomic change, through such mechanisms as nationwide\r\nelections to representative bodies, accountability of State\r\nofficials, a transparent public administration, a reformed\r\njudiciary and a free press.\r\nThis multifaceted process of democratic transformation\r\nis taking place in full measure in our country too. This is\r\nconfirmed by the fact that on 9 November 1995, in\r\nStrasbourg, Ukraine was solemnly admitted as a full-\r\nfledged member of the Council of Europe. It has acceded\r\nto the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and\r\nFundamental Freedoms, and is constantly occupied with\r\ndeveloping a multi-party system, establishing free and\r\nindependent mass media, consolidating democratic\r\nstructures of government, and carrying out legal reform.\r\nOur delegation would especially like to emphasize that\r\ninter-ethnic peace has been firmly established in sovereign\r\nUkraine, and there are no ethnic conflicts. This undeniably\r\nshows that we are on the right lines in such an extremely\r\nimportant and delicate sphere as State policy on national\r\ngroups.\r\nWe note that Ukraine has confidently embarked on the\r\npath of democratic transformation and will never voluntarily\r\nabandon it. Of course, there are still many obstacles and\r\ndifficulties on this path that are typical for post-socialist\r\ncountries with economies in transition, but for our country\r\nthere is not — and cannot be — any other alternative to\r\nthe establishment of an open civil society.\r\nWe pay tribute to the efforts of Governments to\r\npromote and consolidate new or restored democracies. At\r\nthe same time, we place much hope in the United Nations\r\nsystem to establish constant\r\n“trusteeship over new States in the process of\r\nformation, in order to make the use of force\r\ninadmissible and ensure adherence to the established\r\nnorms of international law” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Plenary Meetings, 35th meeting,\r\np. 6)\r\nas suggested by the President of Ukraine,\r\nMr. L. D. Kuchma, at the Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine fully agrees with the\r\ncontents of the report by the Secretary-General on the\r\nsupport by the United Nations system for new and\r\nrestored democracies, in particular the proposition that:\r\n“Without national and global confidence in the\r\nessential elements required for the development of a\r\nrobust economy, democratization will be threatened”.\r\n(A/50/332, para. 112)\r\nIn this connection, I would like to inform the\r\nGeneral Assembly about a new programme of activities\r\nof the Government of Ukraine, adopted on\r\n11 October 1995 by the Supreme Council, the highest\r\nlegislative body. This programme is aimed primarily at\r\nachieving macroeconomic stabilization and halting the\r\nslump in production, which is the main source of growth\r\nin living standards for the population. Implementation of\r\nthis programme will be accompanied by the adoption of\r\na new Constitution, development of legislation, structural\r\nand industrial readjustment of the economy, consolidation\r\nof the financial and monetary system, retraining of public\r\nservice personnel and a rise in business activity.\r\nIn the realization of these plans, we feel the\r\nunderstanding and support of the international financial\r\norganizations for the problems of Ukraine, and their\r\nreadiness to render assistance in overcoming the complex\r\nproblems of the transitional period. Today Ukraine stands\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nat the beginning of the road to transformational reforms, but\r\nwe believe that it will not change direction and will become\r\na full-fledged member of the community of democratic\r\nStates.\r\nIn the countries with new or restored democracies,\r\nnew negative problems are also appearing, whose solution\r\nreaches beyond the borders of those States. These are the\r\nproblems of refugees and illegal migrants, organized crime\r\nand international terrorism, the transit of narcotic drugs and\r\nso on. As the democratic institutions of the new\r\ndemocracies are strengthened, as pointed out in document\r\nA/50/332, a reduction in the assistance and attention given\r\nto these States by the United Nations system can be\r\nforeseen. In this connection, in the opinion of the Ukrainian\r\ndelegation, international cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the new democracies should not die out, but,\r\non the contrary, should be reinforced, bearing in mind that\r\nevery positive process, unfortunately, also has negative\r\nconsequences, which must be neutralized and eliminated;\r\nthis can be achieved only through the united efforts of\r\nrepresentatives of the world community.\r\nThe development and consolidation of new or restored\r\ndemocracies is a global problem for mankind, the solution\r\nof which, we hope, will occupy the place it deserves in\r\nUnited Nations activities in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Ukrainian delegation supports the draft resolution\r\nintroduced by the delegation of Nicaragua on this agenda\r\nitem and requests that Ukraine be included in the list of\r\nco-sponsors of document A/50/L.19.\r\nMr. Sychou (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nFirst of all, I should like to thank United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his informative and\r\ncomprehensive report to the General Assembly on the\r\nforms and mechanisms of support by the United Nations\r\nsystem for new and restored democracies.\r\nAt this session, as it did last year, the Republic of\r\nBelarus has joined in co-sponsoring the draft resolution on\r\nthis question. We consider that the process of creation and\r\ndemocratic development of States which have experienced\r\ntotalitarianism in their history and then rejected it deserves\r\nfull support and encouragement by the United Nations and\r\nby the world community as a whole. The fact that the\r\nUnited Nations is tackling this topic in its fiftieth\r\nanniversary year is the result of the radical changes that\r\nhave occurred in the post-confrontational world and bears\r\nwitness to the ability of the United Nations to react\r\nenergetically to the new challenges of time.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus, which in March 1994\r\nadopted a new Constitution focusing first and foremost on\r\npeople and respect for their inalienable rights and\r\nfreedoms, and which has elected the first President in its\r\nhistory, has embarked on democratic reforms. The\r\nexperience of the early years of independence and\r\nprogress on the road to reform unfortunately has shown\r\nthat the processes of transformation of political and\r\neconomic systems require large material and social\r\nresources, and do not always go forward painlessly.\r\nIn the case of Belarus, these processes have been\r\nburdened by the consequences of the erstwhile senseless\r\narms race, which resulted in the accumulation on its\r\nterritory of a considerable quantity of armaments which\r\nour State must today reduce in accordance with its\r\ninternational obligations. The solution of questions linked\r\nwith the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident are a serious\r\nadditional burden for the national economy. However,\r\nwhatever the specific problems characteristic of each State\r\nexperiencing a period of transition to a democratic form\r\nof social organization, one thing is beyond question:\r\nnamely, that overcoming the obstacles standing in the way\r\ndepends on the effectiveness of the interrelationship\r\nbetween democracy and development.\r\nThe Managua Declaration, adopted at the Second\r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored Democracies\r\nin July 1994, reaffirms the proposition that:\r\n“Development, as one of the fundamental rights\r\nof all nations, promotes the full exercise of\r\ndemocracy”. (A/49/713, para. 6)\r\nAt the same time, the stable development of new or\r\nrestored democracies depends on the successful reform of\r\nits political and economic institutions, and we believe that\r\nthe United Nations possibilities in that direction are far\r\nfrom having been exhausted.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to confirm the\r\nattachment of the Government of Belarus to the principles\r\nof democracy, political pluralism and the protection of\r\nhuman rights, and to express the hope that the draft\r\nresolution on “Support by the United Nations system of\r\nthe efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate\r\nnew or restored democracies” will be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Laing (Belize): Democracy is often painful.\r\nWhen the old order changes, politicians in power,\r\nbureaucrats and others associated with them suffer. So do\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\ntheir domestic and foreign collaborators, since scholars,\r\ngovernmental colleagues, diplomats and others now have to\r\ndevelop new relationships, friendships and even loyalties.\r\nDemocracy, in the sense of the process of the exercise\r\nof the popular will, is often painful as well. On the one\r\nhand, the masses do not always use the best table manners\r\nin exercising their choice. On the other hand, the obvious\r\nchoice of the people — the anointed — sometimes do not\r\naccept the popular will and do not serve.\r\nWhen the people have spoken, their anointed\r\nrepresentatives, once in office, often interpret their mandate\r\nin ways not acceptable to the people. The value system,\r\nconcepts and laws of the new leaders might provoke a\r\ndesire, or even a clamour, for that which was recently\r\njettisoned.\r\nHowever, centuries of accumulated history have taught\r\nus that the alternatives to democracy are no substitute for\r\nthat fragile and often bitter plant. If pain accompanies the\r\npleasure of democracy, this is merely a human reality. We\r\nmust therefore express heartfelt praise to those nations\r\nMembers of this Organization that, with little prior tutelage\r\nin or experience of democracy, have taken the giant step\r\ninto that terra incognita.\r\nAll praise is due to the Secretary-General for the\r\nvaluable efforts at undergirding democracy described in his\r\nreport contained in document A/50/332. Praise is also due\r\nto the Commonwealth for similar efforts. We must also\r\nensure that both organizations are provided with support,\r\nespecially voluntary support, in the performance of their\r\nremarkable tasks.\r\nThe report discusses the task of promoting a\r\ndemocratic culture. In that connection, it stresses the\r\nimportance of nurturing a climate for pluralistic political\r\nparties and movements. My delegation wishes to support\r\nthe various suggestions, including the importance of\r\nestablishing systems for appropriate training.\r\nRegarding the report’s discussion of the need for free\r\nand independent media, we are impressed with the efforts\r\nof the Department of Public Information (DPI) to support\r\nindependent and pluralistic media in various regions. We\r\nwish to stress the importance of such media’s being\r\ncompletely autonomous, if not autochthonous. This is\r\nparticularly necessary in these days of globalism in the\r\nmedia, since global uniformity is, logically, anathema to\r\ntrue freedom, independence and democracy. We hope, too,\r\nthat in its seminars, in the context of the political process,\r\nDPI stresses the importance of the media’s renouncing the\r\nuse and abuse of sound bites that distort and deceive.\r\nAs the report suggests, establishing an adequate\r\npolitical culture requires broad-based civic education. This\r\ncould be aided by the sponsorship of study visits by\r\npoliticians and others to appropriate countries with well-\r\ndeveloped electoral systems. However, ways and means\r\nmust also be found to inculcate in politicians, who often\r\noperate systems of spoils, the value of love, a word we do\r\nnot often utter in this hallowed Hall.\r\nOne cannot express anything less than unstinting\r\npraise for the numerous actions of electoral assistance\r\ntaken by the Organization, as described in the report. As\r\nwith the similar actions which have been taken by the\r\nCommonwealth, one is bound to recall that a major\r\ningredient of the venerable doctrine of self-determination\r\nis the human right to democracy. One may therefore\r\nlegitimately ask whether or not there has developed a\r\nuniversal legal norm commanding broad-based\r\ndemocracy. Of course, any such universal requirement of\r\ndemocracy would have to be in line with the desiderata of\r\ndecentralization and respect for and compliance with the\r\ntraditional structures of authority in society, as discussed\r\nin the report. Likewise, the structures of government\r\nwhich, pursuant to that norm, must be built should indeed\r\ninclude the other human rights, as the report seems to\r\nindicate. However, we would remind representatives that\r\nsuch human rights should, in addition to civil and political\r\nrights, include cultural, economic and social rights.\r\nSuch a broad-based democracy must clearly\r\nincorporate a set of firm legal structures. But, as the\r\nreport clearly indicates, those structures should not, willy-\r\nnilly, connote a\r\n“wholesale transfer of Western-based legislation”\r\n(A/50/332, para. 103)\r\nAfter all, democracy, by definition, must have a variable\r\ncontent, for which the United Nations must provide\r\nappropriate and tailor-made assistance. Happily, the report\r\nidentifies the importance of assistance through capacity-\r\nbuilding, civil service reform and improving\r\naccountability, transparency and quality of public-sector\r\nmanagement. In this connection, the baneful character of\r\ncorruption is stressed. My delegation urges that efforts to\r\nextirpate this scourge should be no less far-reaching than\r\nthose directed at the evils of terrorism and narcotics. And\r\nthey should reach, as far as is appropriate, into the private\r\nsector, which is increasingly a substitute for government.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nThat thought leads to consideration of the extent to\r\nwhich unmitigated globalism is consistent with democracy.\r\nInasmuch as globalism connotes uninhibited concentration\r\nand monopolization of business organizations, production\r\nand markets, it must be asked whether it is compatible with\r\nthe popularism inherent in democracy. My delegation hopes\r\nthat this subject will be taken up by the Secretariat in its\r\nfuture work.\r\nFinally, my delegation fully expects that,\r\ninternationally, democracy will continue to be developed as\r\na relevant and vibrant value and institution. As Belizean\r\nPrime Minister Manuel Esquivel recently remarked to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the unfinished business of this\r\nOrganization is equality. My delegation believes that\r\nequality is a vital aspect of democracy which we must\r\nenshrine in such fields as the role of small States in the\r\nglobal system, the participation of women and the\r\ncomposition and structure of the Security Council.\r\nOur thanks are due the Philippines and Nicaragua,\r\nwhich have kept before the General Assembly and the\r\nworld this important subject of support for the new or\r\nrestored democracies. However, as we have indicated, the\r\nsubject needs to be extended to include all democracies.\r\nMr. Ordzhonikidze (Russian Federation)\r\n(interpretation from Russian): The movement of countries\r\nof new and renewed democracy was born very recently. Its\r\nhistory is not long, not as long as the history of\r\ndemocracies or the 50-year history of the United Nations,\r\nwhich emerged in response to the challenge posed to world\r\nsociety by totalitarianism.\r\nNevertheless, the movement has already passed two\r\nmajor milestones — the First and Second International\r\nConferences of New or Restored Democracies, held in\r\nManila and Managua, respectively — and we are gradually\r\npreparing the ideological foundations for cooperation\r\nbetween the States participants in the movement. The\r\nManagua Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted last\r\nyear do indeed bode well for the future, and we hope that\r\nthe next Conference, in Bucharest, will lead to an even\r\ngreater understanding that the tasks to be carried out by\r\nStates with different forms of democratic structures are\r\ncommon to all of us.\r\nThe ideas underlying the movement of countries with\r\nnew or restored democracies cannot but be consonant with\r\nthe ideals of the community of nations. Consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and political stability promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment and economic growth. As we see it, the value\r\nof democratization is primarily that, having become an\r\nintegral part of the internal political processes, it provides\r\na basis for reconciliation, tolerance, full application of,\r\nrespect for and defence of human rights, and the\r\ndevelopment of social practices based on the peaceful\r\nsearch for constructive solutions.\r\nAt a time when democracies, proceeding from the\r\npluralism of ideas and interests as expressed by parties,\r\nmovements and ethnic, religious and language groups, are\r\nexerting efforts towards further development, people are\r\nlearning tolerance and beginning to understand that\r\npotential differences are not grounds for crude force,\r\nterrorist acts or appeals to separatism; and at a time when\r\nways of stabilizing internal situations are no longer the\r\nmain concern of Governments, real preconditions begin to\r\nexist for sustained economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment geared to the individual.\r\nIn our view, awareness of the positive potential of\r\nthese common ideas served as the basis for political\r\nconsensus and the adoption last year of the resolution\r\nrecognizing the importance of the Managua Declaration\r\nand the Plan of Action and requesting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to study the ways and mechanisms in which the\r\nUnited Nations system could support the efforts of the\r\nGovernments of new and restored democracies. Today,\r\nrelying on this important document, States can continue\r\nthe dialogue on what must be done so that efforts by\r\nGovernments to develop democracy not only enjoy the\r\nsupport of the United Nations system, but so that in fact\r\nthe very focused activities of the world community itself\r\ncan serve to promote and strengthen democratic structures\r\nin Member States.\r\nWe believe that putting the question this way could\r\nprovide a powerful incentive to develop respect for\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law and legality and to put\r\na brake on the danger of the disintegration of State\r\nstructures or the emergence of internal conflicts. It is not\r\nnecessary to mention the resources that are used by the\r\nUnited Nations system to deal with the consequences of\r\ninternal conflict, but of course these United Nations\r\nefforts cannot in themselves and all at once fully heal the\r\nwounds inflicted on peoples by aggressive\r\nnationalism and contemporary manifestations of racism or\r\nreligious intolerance. Massive flows of refugees from\r\nplaces where the democratic institutions, because of their\r\nweakness have not been able to challenge conflicts about\r\nto erupt into political discussion and constructive\r\nsolutions, are sad testimony to this.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General highlights some\r\naspects of the question of how to provide United Nations\r\nsystem support for the efforts of Governments to promote\r\nand consolidate new or restored democracies. Perhaps it is\r\nnot altogether fortuitous that the main focus has been on\r\nassistance in holding elections. Democracy, as is well\r\nknown, begins with the awareness of the right of everybody\r\nto participate in the government of his country either\r\ndirectly or through freely elected representatives, and the\r\nRussian Federation, consistently following this difficult\r\nprocess of step-by-step constitutional reform, will gladly\r\nwelcome international observers, including United Nations\r\nobservers, for our elections in December.\r\nBut, in our view, no less important than the holding of\r\nelections are such activities of the United Nations as\r\nproviding assistance to States in establishing free and\r\nindependent mass- information media, promoting the\r\nestablishment of educational systems in the area of human\r\nrights, establishing and strengthening democratic structures\r\nof administration, ensuring the supremacy of law, and so\r\nforth.\r\nRecognizing that democracy and development are\r\namong the main foundations of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the States participating in the Second International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies agreed that\r\nstrengthening democratic processes is a key element in\r\nconsolidating peace and international security. Russia\r\ncannot but welcome this approach.\r\nMr. Jele (South Africa): My delegation considers that\r\nthe agenda item before us represents one of the important\r\naspects of the principles guiding this body.\r\nEven as a young democracy, South Africa has already\r\nexperienced many of the facets that the draft resolution and\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report address. Having experienced\r\nthe destructive and anti-human force of apartheid, we owe\r\nit to ourselves and to humanity to order our affairs in such\r\na manner that an effective and lasting blow is struck against\r\nany form of dictatorship.\r\nWe believe Member States must build on the cause,\r\ncommon to us all, that everywhere on the globe there is a\r\nprocess leading to the entrenchment of democratic systems\r\nof government. The ordinary people of the world must have\r\nthe freedom to determine their destiny, unhindered by\r\ntyrants and dictators. However, we must guard against the\r\ntendency to project certain models of democracy as a\r\nuniversal panacea and role models for all Member States.\r\nThe role of the United Nations system to support\r\nefforts by Governments to promote and consolidate new\r\nor restored democracies is a vital one for those States\r\nemerging into democracy. The United Nations has vast\r\nexperience in this area and should support efforts towards\r\ngood governance. In this context we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s report contained in document\r\nA/50/332.\r\nWe in South Africa are engaged in the process of\r\nredefining ourselves in democratic terms. Our drive\r\ntowards a democratic dispensation is motivated by the\r\nunshakeable belief that only democracy can and will\r\nsatisfy the yearning of equality and freedom for all the\r\npeople of South Africa, Black and White.\r\nOur Government of National Unity is committed to\r\na people-centred society of liberty. Far from using ethnic\r\ndiversity to promote racial domination and tyranny, as\r\nwitnessed in the dark days of apartheid, the new\r\nGovernment recognizes ethnic and cultural diversity as\r\npart of the rich tapestry of our country, a creative\r\ncontribution to building a non-racial, non-sexist,\r\ndemocratic South Africa. We therefore consider it vital to\r\nbuild a future premised on fundamental human rights, and\r\nfor the realization of this objective we pursue an approach\r\nthat recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that\r\nperceives no difference between civil and political rights,\r\non the one hand, and cultural, social and economic rights,\r\non the other.\r\nThe new Parliament of South Africa now operates\r\nwithin the framework of a Constitution which is the\r\nsupreme law of the country, and under which the\r\nindependent Constitutional Court serves as an effective\r\nmechanism to ensure that Government actions are in line\r\nwith our Bill of Human Rights.\r\nThe Secretary-General has touched on a number of\r\nkey issues that are essential for the promotion and\r\nconsolidation of democracy. A multiparty political system,\r\nfree and independent media, the building of a political\r\nculture through civic education, regular elections, the\r\ncreation and strengthening of democratic structures of\r\ngovernment, and respect for the rule of law are some of\r\nthe most important aspects. Just as important are\r\ngovernment accountability and transparency.\r\nThe challenge to the United Nations is to answer the\r\nquestion: given our interdependence, what is it that we\r\ncan and must do to ensure that democracy, peace and\r\nprosperity prevail everywhere?\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nMy delegation believes that the elaboration of the new\r\nworld order must of necessity centre on this Organization\r\nand that appropriate forums should be found in which we\r\ncould all participate to help determine the shape of the new\r\nworld. We believe, as our President has said, that the four\r\nelements that would need to be knit together in fashioning\r\nthat new, universal reality are: democracy, peace, prosperity\r\nand interdependence.\r\nAs we continue to debate the reform of the United\r\nNations, we believe that the Organization should once more\r\nturn its focused and sustained attention to the basics of\r\neverything that makes for a better world for all humanity.\r\nIn this regard, the thought-provoking observations and\r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport deserve our careful consideration.\r\nWe fully support the draft resolution before us and\r\nhope it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Alakwaa (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nNo one values the blessings of democracy more than those\r\nwho have been deprived of it. We, in the Republic of\r\nYemen, have included in the Constitution of the United\r\nYemen a number of principal articles that guarantee\r\ndemocracy and protect human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. We have not confined ourselves to legislating\r\nand laying down rules and regulations that do just that, but\r\nhave gone beyond the theoretical framework into the field\r\nof genuine actual exercise of democracy. In the political\r\narena in our country there are now more than 30 political\r\nparties and more than 100 newspapers and periodicals. The\r\nfirst parliamentary elections in United Yemen were\r\norganized on the 27th of April 1993, with the participation\r\nof all national forces without exception. In short, all\r\nsegments of Yemeni society now have the right to\r\nparticipate in policy-formulation and in decision-making as\r\nwell as in the actual implementation of such policies and\r\ndecisions. The Government of United Yemen is now\r\nengaged in returning confiscated properties to their rightful\r\nowners and in compensating those who sustain a loss as a\r\nresult of such return. It has also cancelled all restrictions on\r\nemigration. There is no citizen that is now deprived of the\r\nright to travel abroad.\r\nWhile we agree with the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral contained in document A/50/332, in particular with\r\nparagraphs 5 and 7 of its introduction, to the effect that\r\ndemocracy is not a model to be copied from certain States,\r\nand on the ways and means whereby assistance may be\r\ngiven in this regard, we believe that notwithstanding the\r\nexistence of special circumstances and characteristics in\r\ncertain societies, this should not prevent the establishment\r\nor restoration of democracy albeit gradually, until such\r\ncircumstances and characteristics allow for the adoption\r\nof a genuine and developing democratic system that\r\nwould be founded on the participation by all in action and\r\nin the business of Government.\r\nWe share the opinion voiced by the Foreign Minister\r\nof Nicaragua, namely that democracy is not an end in\r\nitself and that is not a cure-all for the ills of society. Yes,\r\nindeed, it is no panacea for all problems, but it does\r\nafford all social forces the opportunity of working\r\ntogether in seeking solutions to those problems. We value\r\nthe assistance extended by the United Nations for the\r\nconsolidation or restoration of democracy. Incidentally,\r\npreparations will be made shortly in the Republic of\r\nYemen for the holding of the second parliamentary\r\nelections in the context of our abiding unity. We shall be\r\ngrateful for any assistance that may be extended to us by\r\nthis Organization, by any Member State or by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in our forthcoming electoral\r\nprocess.\r\nFinally, we support fully the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/50/L.19, soon to be adopted by\r\nthis Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on item 41.\r\nI should like to inform members that action on draft\r\nresolution A/50/L.19 will be taken at a later date, to be\r\nannounced.\r\nAgenda item 47\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall that at\r\nits 108th meeting, held on 18 September 1995, the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted decision 49/499, by which the\r\nAssembly decided\r\n“that the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council\r\nshould continue its work, taking into account, inter\r\nalia, the progress achieved during the forty-eighth\r\nand forty-ninth sessions and the views expressed\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nduring the fiftieth session of the General Assembly,\r\nincluding its Special Commemorative Meeting on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, and submit a report to the Assembly before\r\nthe end of its fiftieth session, including any agreed\r\nrecommendations”.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to recall, for the\r\nattention of members, document A/49/965, which contains\r\na letter dated 15 September 1995 from the Permanent\r\nRepresentatives of Finland and Thailand to the United\r\nNations addressed to the President of the General\r\nAssembly. The two Permanent Representatives, in their\r\ncapacities as Vice-Chairmen of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup during the forty-ninth session, forward to the\r\nAssembly in document A/49/965 the compendium of their\r\nobservations and assessments, their discussion papers, and\r\nproposals and other documents presented to the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group.\r\nBefore calling on the first speaker, I should like to\r\npropose that the list of speakers in the debate on this item\r\nbe closed today at noon.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: There are already 70 names on\r\nthe list of speakers. I therefore request those representatives\r\nwishing to participate in the debate to add their names to\r\nthe list as soon as possible. In view of the long list, I\r\nshould like to appeal to members to keep their statements\r\nto no more than 10 minutes, if possible.\r\nMr. Martínez Blanco (Honduras) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Honduras is speaking in the debate on item 47 of\r\nthe agenda, “Question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters”, on behalf also of the Central American\r\ncountries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua\r\nand Panama.\r\nCentral America welcomes and takes note of document\r\nA/49/965, which the General Assembly has before it today.\r\nWe would like to thank the Vice-Chairmen of the Open-\r\nended Working Group, the Permanent Representatives of\r\nFinland and Thailand, for their dedicated efforts in\r\npreparing this document in their personal capacity.\r\nLegitimacy and effectiveness are the two\r\ncharacteristics that must distinguish the Security Council of\r\nthe United Nations before the international community.\r\nTwo other goals sought by the Working Group are\r\ntransparency and democracy in the work of the Council,\r\nthe organ upon which the Charter has conferred primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Making the Security Council into a more\r\nrepresentative, credible and effective body with a more\r\nequitable composition is the general objective of the effort\r\nbegun with the adoption, in this Hall, of resolutions 47/62\r\nand 48/26.\r\nMuch was done to achieve these objectives during\r\nthe forty-ninth regular session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe dialogue in the Working Group made it possible to\r\nidentify some points of agreement among Member\r\nStates and to draw up a compendium of ideas and\r\nproposals, which will serve as an important basis for the\r\nnegotiating stage to be undertaken by the Working Group.\r\nHowever, major differences remain that will require in-\r\ndepth analysis by the Working Group.\r\nCentral America shares the view that the objective\r\nof increasing the membership of the Security Council is\r\nto enhance its legitimacy while maintaining its\r\neffectiveness. The increase will have to reflect the\r\nchanges that have taken place on the international scene,\r\nincluding the substantial increase in the membership of\r\nthe United Nations. The desire expressed by the Members\r\nof the United Nations to enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council will become reality if we make the\r\nCouncil as representative an organ as possible, reflecting\r\nthe universal character of the United Nations and\r\nincluding within it the greatest possible variety of\r\ninterests and views, and if we adopt, as guiding principles\r\nto that end, those of the sovereign equality of States and\r\nof equitable geographical distribution, as provided in the\r\nCharter.\r\nCentral America believes that the principle of\r\ndemocratization in international relations requires greater\r\nrepresentativity in the organs of the United Nations. Only\r\na Security Council with a broad membership based on the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation can\r\nhave the necessary legitimacy to act on behalf of all the\r\nMembers of the United Nations, as it should pursuant to\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 1, of the Charter. Only a broad\r\nmembership can give the Security Council greater\r\ncredibility, for its members will then be inclined to\r\ngreater participation in the collective responsibility of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe recognize the importance for the composition of\r\nthe Council of the participation, as permanent members,\r\nof those States that have global political and economic\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\ninfluence and the capacity to share in, and contribute\r\nfinancially to, the responsibility for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. However, we would deem\r\nit unacceptable if, through the application of those criteria,\r\nonly developed countries could be admitted to the category\r\nof permanent membership. That would be incompatible\r\nwith the principles of the sovereign equality of all Members\r\nof the United Nations and the democratization of\r\ninternational relations. We believe that, in order to arrive at\r\na consensus in selecting new permanent members, we\r\nshould include developing countries in that category,\r\napplying the same criteria as those set forth in the Charter\r\nfor the election of non-permanent members. Ideally, the\r\ncategory of permanent membership would be eliminated\r\ngradually, because its creation was justified by past realities\r\nbut is no longer appropriate in the new international\r\ncontext.\r\nThe Central American region strongly supports the\r\nidea of increasing the number of non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council, in view of the need for equitable\r\ngeographical representation. In this context, we believe that\r\nthe various proposals submitted by the Member States\r\ndeserve careful analysis. We are of the view that the\r\ncountries of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and\r\nAsia should have increased representation in the Council.\r\nThe United Nations has grown considerably in the past 30\r\nyears. This justifies increasing the membership of the\r\nCouncil, mainly with developing countries — which\r\nconstitute the majority of Member States — so that their\r\ninterests can be duly represented, thereby preserving the\r\npluralistic nature of the Council and democratizing its\r\ndecision-taking processes. We believe also that the non-\r\npermanent members should have an opportunity to be re-\r\nelected alternately. To that end, Article 23, paragraph 2, of\r\nthe Charter would have to be amended. This measure could\r\nhelp to improve representation in the Council.\r\nThe countries of Central America believe that the right\r\nof veto should be limited and ultimately abolished. The\r\ncircumstances at the end of the Second World War that\r\ngave rise to the veto have changed and there is no longer\r\nany justification whatsoever for the veto. Central Americans\r\nfeel that the right of veto should not be granted to any\r\npotential permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nEqual treatment for new and old permanent members is an\r\nunacceptable legal basis for granting it, also because the\r\nveto in itself is an anti-democratic practice and is contrary\r\nto the principle of the sovereign equality of States. Any\r\nreform of the Council will have to settle this issue with a\r\nview ultimately to abolishing the veto. To that end, we\r\nagree with the proposal to hold periodic reviews of the\r\nveto and other voting procedures.\r\nWith regard to other matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil, Central America is satisfied with the progress\r\nmade towards increasing transparency and with regard to\r\nthe Council’s working methods. The measures already\r\nadopted, which simply reflect the discussions held in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, are a significant contribution\r\nto increasing the Council’s legitimacy and credibility. We\r\nbelieve that these measures should be institutionalized and\r\nreviewed periodically, and we agree that there should be\r\nmore consultations between the Security Council and\r\ninterested parties, regional arrangements and organizations\r\nand countries that contribute troops to peace-keeping\r\noperations. Similarly, we acknowledge that it is important\r\nfor the Security Council to adopt specific measures to\r\nimprove the working relationship with the General\r\nAssembly, with other United Nations bodies, and with\r\nStates that are not members of the Council.\r\nThe Central American region feels that the results of\r\nthe efforts made at the last two sessions by the Open-\r\nended Working Group are highly significant and lay a\r\nfirm foundation for beginning the Security Council reform\r\nprocess. We are sure that the various proposals made by\r\nMember States or groups of Member States are all useful\r\nand will help to expedite negotiations. As the Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Open-ended Working Group have\r\nrecognized, much remains to be done before broad\r\nagreement is reached among all Member States, but to\r\nsecure that agreement we should continue to give impetus\r\nto the activities of the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nFinally, the Central American States share the view\r\nthat Member States should take full advantage of the\r\nmomentum generated by the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations to use this fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly to work towards the substantial achievements\r\nwe have set in motion.\r\nWe hope that the reform of the Security Council will\r\nbe realistic and inspired by democratic principles and\r\nobjective criteria so that all Members of the United\r\nNations, including small States, have the opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the Council and thereby to help it shoulder\r\nits tremendous responsibility.\r\nMr. Kamunanwire (Uganda): In the light of\r\nstatements made during the forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, it had been the wish of most\r\ndelegations that the settlement of the question of equitable\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nrepresentation on and an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and related matters would be one of the\r\nmost important outcomes of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. Unfortunately, this is not happening.\r\nInstead, differences and divergent views on the issue\r\ncontinue to make a breakthrough difficult.\r\nMy delegation, however, recognizes and commends\r\nthe seriousness and serious efforts of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Chairman and the two Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Open-ended Working Group on the matter.\r\nIn particular, we pay special tribute to Ambassador\r\nWilhelm Breitenstein of Finland and Ambassador Nitya\r\nPibulsonggram of Thailand for the achievements so far. In\r\ntheir report, the Vice-Chairmen conclude that there is\r\ngeneral agreement on the expansion of the Security Council\r\nand on reviewing its working methods and other matters\r\nrelated to its functioning in a way that further strengthens\r\nits capacity and effectiveness, enhances its representative\r\ncharacter and improves its working efficiency. This\r\nachievement should now enable us to resolutely narrow the\r\ncrucial issues of how to expand the Council and review its\r\nworking methods.\r\nA number of proposals have been made on guiding\r\nprinciples for the democratization of the Security Council.\r\nThe principle of equitable geographical distribution of\r\npermanent seats in the Security Council, reflecting the\r\ncurrent expanded membership of the United Nations should\r\nbe of the essence. Other considerations such as\r\n“the capacity to share global responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security”\r\n(A/49/965, para. 6)\r\nshould not demean another principle, that of political\r\ncommitment by all Member States. Moreover, any attempt\r\nto give prominence only to the most powerful nations will\r\nserve to negate the principle of the equal sovereignty of all\r\nMember States. The position of Uganda is that Africa\r\nshould be allocated permanent seats in the expanded\r\nSecurity Council proportional to the size of its membership\r\nin the United Nations.\r\nAny genuine reform of the Security Council must\r\naddress the question of the veto. Whatever categories and\r\ntypes of membership are finally agreed upon, all members\r\nof the Security Council should exercise equal powers.\r\nEither the veto power applies to all or it should be\r\ndispensed with. The argument that the veto power\r\n“had ensured the continued participation of the\r\nmajor Powers in the Organization” (ibid., para. 13)\r\nsends messages of domination; and it not only undermines\r\ndemocratic principles but also contravenes the Charter\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of all Member States.\r\nIn its present form, the Security Council has initiated\r\ncommendable measures and new practices aimed at\r\nimprovements in transparency and working methods. This\r\nmomentum should continue so that the measures taken\r\nand practices adopted reflect total transparency and\r\nclearly streamlined methods of work within the Council.\r\nIn particular, there should be a mutual relationship\r\nbetween the Council and the other organs of the United\r\nNations, especially the General Assembly.\r\nIn this respect, the General Assembly, as the\r\nsupreme policy-making organ, should be constantly and\r\nfully informed on all issues and strategies of which the\r\nCouncil is seized, as the Assembly is the most\r\nrepresentative forum, the body where all Member States\r\nhave equal opportunity to express their concerns and\r\ninterests with regard to various issues — including peace-\r\nkeeping and international security — that affect the\r\ninternational community.\r\nFurther, with regard to the issue of Security Council\r\nconsultations concerning peace-keeping operations, it is\r\nlogical and important to include regional organizations\r\nand countries of the region concerned. These not only\r\nplay a complementary role in preventive diplomacy and\r\npeace-keeping but also, and in particular, bear the brunt\r\nof the influx of those whom conflict has made refugees\r\nor displaced persons, as well as providing logistical bases\r\nfor peace-keeping operations.\r\nIf my delegation is pressing for democratization of\r\nthe Security Council and for strengthening of the General\r\nAssembly, it is because an inequitable United Nations will\r\nserve neither the ends of peace nor those of development.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): As I am speaking for the first time\r\nunder your presidency, Sir, I should like to begin by\r\nrecognizing the very important contribution that you, as\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Thailand, have made to\r\nthe work and activities of the United Nations, thanks to\r\nyour experience, talent and impartiality.\r\nWe held the very first meeting of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on reform of the Security Council on 19\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nJanuary 1994. We have been discussing this question, at\r\ntimes very intensely, for almost two years.\r\nWe have, by and large, reached consensus on some\r\nessentials — namely, that the Council must operate with\r\ntransparency, effectiveness and efficiency and must have\r\nbetter coordination with the General Assembly and with\r\nother United Nations bodies. But no progress whatsoever\r\nhas been made on the essential issue of enlargement.\r\nPositions on this point have not become any closer; if\r\nanything, they are further apart and more entrenched than\r\never. Consequently, we missed the initial target: to agree on\r\nreform in time for the fiftieth anniversary. The only thing\r\nwhich we seem to have agreed on is that we are in\r\nprofound disagreement on how to enlarge the Council.\r\nThe reasons behind this disagreement are very clear to\r\nthe Italian delegation. We are confronted by two opposing\r\nvisions of the future of our Organization. One is an\r\napproach that I do not hesitate to call elitist; the other is a\r\ndemocratic one.\r\nSome Member States maintain that we should increase\r\nthe number of permanent seats by two — a solution that\r\nhas been dubbed “the quick fix”. Even though this formula\r\nhas apparently been abandoned by some of its initiators,\r\nothers still seem to favour it. Reform of this type would not\r\nbe evolution. Rather, it would be involution of the present\r\nsystem. The five current permanent members are all from\r\nthe northern hemisphere, and almost all of them are fully\r\nindustrialized, prosperous nations. Adding two more with\r\nthe same profile, rather than correcting this imbalance,\r\nwould clearly aggravate it.\r\nA variation of this formula is the “2+3” proposal: two\r\npermanent seats for highly developed nations, and three\r\npermanent seats for the developing world — that is to say,\r\none for Asia, one for Africa and one for Latin America.\r\nObjections have been raised to this approach, for many\r\nreasons.\r\nFirst, it would benefit only two or five Members of\r\nthe United Nations, to the detriment of the remaining 175.\r\nThe end result would be a small directorate of big\r\ncountries, making critical decisions on questions that affect\r\nus all, but on which we would have no say. Furthermore,\r\nthis formula would introduce the concept of elitism — of\r\ncontinental, hegemonic power — where it has so far been\r\nabsent and where, I believe, it does not belong: in the world\r\nof non-aligned countries.\r\nSecondly, this formula would double the number of\r\nCouncil members fully absolved from the need to stand\r\nfor democratic election. And, to me, one thing is clear: if\r\n10 members of the Security Council were never again —\r\nno more, for eternity — to have to pass the test of an\r\nelection, the General Assembly’s attempts at dialogue and\r\ninteraction with such a Council would have almost nil\r\nresults.\r\nThirdly, there are countries that contribute more to\r\nthe United Nations budget than do some of the current\r\npermanent members. Others have larger populations or\r\nmake more substantial contributions to United Nations\r\nactivities. If they were shut out of permanent membership,\r\nthey would inevitably compete for non-permanent seats\r\nmuch more frequently than they do now. This, in turn,\r\nwould greatly diminish the election chances of other,\r\nmedium-sized to small, countries in their respective\r\ngeographic groups. Disharmony, resentment, even\r\nacrimony would prevail if the “quick fix” or the “2+3”\r\nformula were adopted.\r\nFourthly, since permanent members cannot be\r\nremoved, except by their own agreement — a most\r\nunlikely occurrence — the new permanent members\r\nwould, in principle, sit on the Council for eternity,\r\nimpervious to changes in the world or in their own\r\nfortunes.\r\nFifthly, permanent members, as we all very well\r\nknow, are assured a continuous presence in other\r\nimportant bodies of the United Nations system. If other\r\npermanent members were to be created, they would\r\nundoubtedly aspire to those same benefits, considering\r\nthem an implicit and undeniable prerogative of their new\r\nstatus. This would risk creating a virtual monopoly of\r\npermanent members — old and new — over many bodies\r\nin the United Nations system, the so-called “cascade\r\neffect”.\r\nLast but not least, increasing the number of\r\npermanent members would double the number of vetoes\r\non the Security Council, and threaten to paralyse its\r\nactivity. The veto, as has already been stated by the two\r\nprevious speakers, is an institution whose time has\r\ncome — during the cold war years — and gone. We\r\nshould be focusing on how to limit its use, not on how to\r\nproliferate it.\r\nThe opposite vision of the future of our Organization\r\nis, instead, that of democracy, equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, and equitable rotation. We strongly believe\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nthat rotation is the key word for a truly democratic reform.\r\nItaly’s proposal moves in this direction. Our project has\r\nundergone many changes since it was first presented at the\r\nbeginning of last year. We have listened to criticism, and\r\ntaken it into account.\r\nWhat we are proposing is to leave the permanent\r\nmembers at five, and increase the Security Council by\r\nadding eight or 10 new non-permanent seats. According to\r\nthis formula, the General Assembly would choose 24-30\r\ncountries to rotate in the additional non-permanent seats\r\nover a six-year period, with each country on the Council for\r\ntwo years and off for four years. Needless to say, those\r\ncountries would be excluded from competing for the current\r\nnon-permanent seats. The General Assembly should select\r\nthose 24-30 countries on the basis of their contribution to\r\nthe general aims of the Organization, particularly peace-\r\nkeeping operations (troops, matériel, financing,\r\nhumanitarian aid, etc.), and other criteria that could no\r\ndoubt be identified by the General Assembly itself. But this\r\ngroup must not be fixed in perpetuity. Every 10-12 years\r\nthere would be a review of the list, and those countries that\r\nhad not honoured their greater responsibilities and\r\ncommitments would be replaced by other members able and\r\nwilling to meet them.\r\nIn our plan, the geographical distribution of the\r\nadditional non-permanent seats should privilege the\r\ncontinents that are currently underrepresented. For example,\r\nif 10 new seats were added, five should go to Africa and\r\nAsia, two to the Latin American and Caribbean States, two\r\nto the Western European and Others Group, and one to\r\nEastern Europe. In this way, 70 per cent of the additional\r\nnon-permanent seats would be reserved for developing\r\ncountries.\r\nCritics of this formula have implied that it ultimately\r\ncreates a third category of members. We do not believe that\r\nthis is so. What we have in mind is not a third category but\r\na system of rotation, as follows.\r\nFirst, like all non-permanent members, the 24-30\r\ncountries would be subject to election by secret ballot —\r\nthe very essence of democracy — and required to obtain a\r\ntwo-thirds majority.\r\nSecondly, this would not be a closed rotation\r\nagreement, but an open one, which should be reviewed\r\nevery 12-15 years. Nothing would prevent other interested\r\ncountries from forming additional rotation agreements,\r\nsome of which already exist — such as the one for Africa\r\n— although they are not always complied with.\r\nThirdly, it should be underlined that while more\r\nfrequently rotating countries, if elected, would sit on the\r\nSecurity Council every six years, all others could, in\r\ntheory, stand for election as often as every four years, in\r\naccordance with the present rules.\r\nFinally, and most important of all, mid-sized and\r\nsmall States would have a concrete, realistic hope of\r\nbeing elected to the Council, since they would no longer\r\nhave to compete for seats with their larger neighbours,\r\nwho systematically elbow them out at every election. And\r\nthose who have been here for a number of years know\r\nthis only too well.\r\nIn fact, those who would benefit the most from our\r\nproposal would be the smaller and mid-sized States, 79 of\r\nwhich have been kept out of the Council so far, while 43\r\nhave served only once. In short, I believe we should work\r\nfor reform that brings about the inclusion of all, and the\r\nexclusion of none.\r\nOne of the reasons most frequently cited for creating\r\ntwo new permanent members is that Germany and Japan\r\nrepresent the new reality of the past 30 years in the\r\ninternational community — the new global powers. With\r\nall due respect, I cannot share this view. These two global\r\npowers, along with others, have existed as global powers\r\nat least since the beginning of the century. The true new\r\nreality of the past 30 years is that 100 or so former\r\ncolonies have become full-fledged sovereign countries. If\r\nthey stand united, they are one of the main players at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n“Economic and social progress will not attain\r\nits full significance unless it is accompanied by an\r\neffort to democratize international life. In my view,\r\ndemocratization is an imperative, not only within\r\nStates but also between States and in all the power\r\ncentres of international society.” (SG/SM/5772)\r\nThese are not my words, but those of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros-Ghali, from his address to the\r\nConference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cartagena\r\nlast October. It is our sincere hope that this spirit, the\r\nspirit of democracy among nations, may also prevail in\r\nthese halls, for the sake of the future of our Organization\r\nand of the international community as a whole.\r\nMr. Jemat (Brunei Darussalam): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to express our appreciation to the\r\nPresident, as well as to the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, His Excellency Mr. Wilhelm\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nBreitenstein and His Excellency Mr. Nitya Pibulsonggram,\r\nfor the report (A/49/965) on this important subject, which\r\nwe hope will take us a considerable step forward in seeing\r\nhow the Security Council can be reformed and revitalized.\r\nThe authority and credibility of the Security Council,\r\nwhich, under the Charter, has primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, have\r\ngrown substantially in recent years. In this task, the Council\r\nmust be strengthened and revitalized so that it can adapt to\r\nnew realities. Majority views are now focused on the\r\nimportance of ensuring that changes in the structure of this\r\nOrganization should reflect the changes in the global\r\npolitical, economic and social landscape.\r\nWe therefore associate ourselves with the general\r\nsupport expressed by members of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the need to increase the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and review its composition, particularly\r\nwith regard to the addition of developing countries. While\r\nexpanding membership to fill both permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats is important, we feel that the question of\r\nrepresentation of interests, particularly for small countries\r\nand countries without regional representation, is even more\r\nimportant. My delegation would like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the composition of the Security Council\r\nreflecting clearly and equitably the geographical distribution\r\nand representation of United Nations membership. In this\r\nregard, we support the need for developing countries of\r\nAfrica, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean to be\r\nrepresented both in permanent and in non-permanent seats\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nApart from the expansion of the Security Council’s\r\nmembership, serious consideration must also be given to the\r\nneed to enhance the effectiveness of the Council’s\r\noperations, particularly in its decision-making process. It is\r\nimportant for the Security Council to continue to maintain\r\nits transparency and openness in order to function\r\nefficiently and effectively. To this end, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the briefings by the President of the Security\r\nCouncil to the non-members of the Council.\r\nThe Security Council has so far experienced both\r\nsuccess and failure. In several cases, its resolutions have\r\nremained merely resolutions and failed to achieve their\r\nintended objectives. On others, imposed resolutions have\r\ntended to punish not only the guilty but also the innocent.\r\nFor instance, the imposition of economic sanctions has had\r\nunintended victims, both in target countries and third\r\ncountries. Adequate precautions must be taken in enforcing\r\nsuch resolutions, and a mechanism needs to be conceived\r\nto ensure that such actions punish the guilty but do not\r\naffect the lives of innocent civilians by depriving them of\r\ntheir basic needs.\r\nAnother concern of my delegation is the power of\r\ncertain States to influence the decision of the majority\r\nwhen such decisions affect vital issues of international\r\npeace and security. My delegation is of the view that the\r\ncurrent reform process should also address the need for a\r\nmore balanced decision-making process that serves the\r\ninterest of the majority.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my\r\ndelegation’s support for the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. We would also like to express our view\r\nthat the reform of the Security Council should strengthen\r\nits effectiveness and its representative character, including\r\nequitable geographic representation for permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members.\r\nMr. Catarino (Portugal): The question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council has been under consideration by the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group since it was established by\r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Much\r\nwork has already been done in the Working Group over\r\nthe last two years.\r\nIn fact, the working methods of the Security Council\r\nhave improved considerably in the last two years, thanks\r\nlargely to the Working Group’s efforts for greater\r\ntransparency in that organ vis-à-vis the general\r\nmembership. Non-members of the Security Council are\r\ntoday far better informed with regard to the deliberations\r\nof the Council. They also have greater access to it and are\r\nable, directly or indirectly, through effective working\r\nmachinery, of communicating their positions on matters\r\nof which the Council is seized.\r\nHowever, now, in the fiftieth session, we are at a\r\npoint where we must strive to move ahead significantly in\r\nthe process of uniting our positions. We must all agree as\r\nsoon as possible on what the Security Council should\r\nlook like and how it should function in order to address\r\nmost effectively the new challenges of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nDuring both the general debate and the Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting, it was clear that many\r\ndelegations concurred in recognizing the need to bring the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nSecurity Council into line with the new realities of\r\ninternational relations. Similarly, the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group states that\r\n“there was agreement to expand the Security Council\r\nand to review its working methods and other matters\r\nrelated to its functioning in a way that further\r\nstrengthens its capacity and effectiveness, enhances its\r\nrepresentative character and improves its working\r\nefficiency.” (A/49/47, para. 13)\r\nWhen the Open-ended Working Group reconvenes this\r\ncoming January, the opportunity to strengthen the Security\r\nCouncil must not be lost. Many proposals have been\r\nforwarded, including a suggestion from Portugal. But the\r\noverriding importance of reaching an agreement on one\r\ncomprehensive package for enhancing the effectiveness of\r\nthe Council must be kept in mind. It will not be possible\r\nfor every proposal to figure in the final package.\r\nWe must all, therefore, exhibit the necessary flexibility\r\nto meet each other on common ground, where the objective,\r\nsurely shared by all, of an effective, representative and\r\nefficient Security Council can be reached. Bridges must be\r\nbuilt and crossed so that the Working Group can pave the\r\nroad towards a consensual solution agreeable to all. We\r\nbelieve that such a solution must benefit the membership as\r\na whole, as well as each and every country, large or small.\r\nAt the end of this process of hard work, all Member\r\nStates must feel that the enhanced Security Council is one\r\nthat represents them, both individually and collectively, in\r\ncarrying out the demanding but vital tasks required in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMr. Londoño-Paredes (Colombia) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): Allow me to congratulate the President on\r\nhis unanimous election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. We are sure that under his leadership the\r\nAssembly will achieve its objectives.\r\nIt is an honour for me to speak on behalf of the\r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries on the agenda item\r\nbefore us, the “Question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters”, which was one of the crucial issues\r\naddressed at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries,\r\nheld in Cartagena last October. As a result of its\r\ndeliberations, the Movement adopted common positions on\r\nthe matter, which are included in the Final Document of the\r\nCartagena Summit. The relevant paragraphs of that\r\nDocument, in its draft form, stated the following:\r\n“The Heads of State or Government welcomed\r\nthe ongoing endeavours aimed at reforming and\r\nimproving certain structures and procedures of the\r\nUnited Nations as an essential component of\r\nstrengthening multilateralism, with a view to\r\nensuring equal participation, more balanced\r\nrepresentation and better equilibrium, in keeping\r\nwith the principles and objectives of the United\r\nNations. In this context, they stressed the need to\r\ndemocratize the United Nations to better reflect the\r\nuniversal nature of the Organization and to fulfil the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality of States. They\r\nunderlined, in particular, the need for full democracy\r\nand transparency in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil, in view of its recent practices and\r\nperformance. They expressed their determination to\r\nparticipate constructively in the process of\r\nrevitalization and reform, in the firm conviction that\r\nthe United Nations is an indispensable forum to be\r\nsupported and strengthened. Yet democratization of\r\nthe international political and economic institutions\r\ninherent in such a process continues to be hampered\r\nby those who seek to preserve their privileged\r\nposition of power. In these endeavours, the main\r\npurpose should be to make the Organization more\r\nresponsive to the changing realities and emerging\r\nchallenges of peace and development in a dynamic\r\ncontext.\r\n“In view of the increasing trend on the part of\r\nsome countries to exercise undue influence over the\r\nSecurity Council and the privileged and dominant\r\nrole that the veto right ensures for the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council, which is contrary to the\r\naim of democratizing the United Nations, they\r\nreiterated their position adopted at the Fifth, Sixth\r\nand Tenth Summits regarding the special privilege of\r\npermanent members of the Security Council to\r\nexercise the veto and committed themselves to\r\nactively promote its curtailment, with a view to its\r\nelimination. Furthermore, while welcoming the\r\nactions taken by the Council with regard to its\r\ntransparency and working methods, they considered\r\nthem still insufficient and urged the General\r\nAssembly to recommend to the Council further\r\nmeasures to ensure its full democratization.\r\n“They took note of the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council, reflecting agreement to expand the\r\nSecurity Council and to review its working methods\r\nand other matters related to its functioning in order to\r\nstrengthen its capacity and effectiveness and enhance\r\nits representative character. As important differences\r\ncontinue to exist, further in-depth consideration of\r\nthese issues is required. They acknowledged that the\r\nnon-aligned countries participated in the deliberations\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group and expressed their\r\ndetermination that the Movement pursue the work of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group in a concerted and\r\nactive manner.\r\n“They reaffirmed that both the reform and the\r\nexpansion aspects of the Security Council should be\r\nconsidered as integral parts of a common package,\r\ntaking into account the principle of sovereign equality\r\nof States and equitable geographic distribution, as well\r\nas the need for transparency, accountability and\r\ndemocratization in the working methods and\r\nprocedures of the Security Council, including its\r\ndecision-making processes. They noted positively the\r\nproposal submitted by the Non-Aligned Movement to\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform, encompassing the issues of membership,\r\ntransparency and working methods of the Council.\r\nThey emphasized that the proposal to expand the\r\nCouncil should be comprehensive in nature in order to\r\nimprove its credibility and thus reflect the universal\r\ncharacter of the world Organization. They considered\r\nit essential to substantially increase the proportion of\r\nmembers of the Council belonging to the Movement\r\nand to that end they urged that the non-aligned\r\ncountries should work towards increasing the\r\nrepresentation of developing countries of Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America and the Caribbean in the Security\r\nCouncil. Any attempt to exclude non-aligned countries\r\nfrom any expansion in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil would be unacceptable to the Movement.\r\nThey therefore agreed on the need for a coherent and\r\ncoordinated approach by the members of the\r\nMovement.\r\n“They stressed the importance of enhancing the\r\neffective functioning of the Security Council by\r\nadopting specific measures aimed at improving the\r\nworking relationship of the Council with the General\r\nAssembly, other organs of the United Nations and\r\nnon-members of the Security Council. They also\r\nunderscored the need to operationalize Article 50 of\r\nthe Charter, particularly by institutionalizing the\r\nconsultations envisaged under this Article, as well as\r\nto adopt other effective measures to enable non-\r\nmembers to bring to the attention of the Council\r\nmembers their problems and difficulties, with a view\r\nto their solution.\r\n“While recognizing the importance acquired by\r\ninformal closed meetings of the members of the\r\nCouncil, they reaffirmed their conviction that those\r\ninformal consultations must not replace the\r\nprovisions enshrined in the Charter and the\r\nprovisional rules of procedure of the Council, nor\r\nrestrict the necessary transparency in its work.\r\n“In order to meet the objective of a\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations that would\r\nachieve democratization, transparency and efficiency\r\nof the Security Council as well as better balance of\r\nfunctions between the principal organs of the United\r\nNations, the Heads of State or Government\r\nexamined various mechanisms, including the\r\npossible convening of the General Conference for\r\nthe revision of the Charter foreseen in Article 109 of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations at an appropriate\r\ntime.”\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to reiterate, on\r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, that we will\r\ncontinue to work in the Open-ended Working Group in a\r\nconstructive, concerted and active manner.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): I wish to thank the\r\nChairman of the Working Group, Mr. Amara Essy, and\r\nthe two Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nMr. Pibulsonggram of Thailand, for their outstanding\r\ncontributions to the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council. I am\r\nconfident that my colleagues join me in commending\r\nthem on a job well done in tackling the complex and\r\nhighly sensitive tasks with which they have been\r\nentrusted.\r\nI would also like to express my full confidence in\r\nthe leadership of the new President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Freitas do Amaral. There is no question in\r\nmy mind that his wise guidance will significantly advance\r\nthe debate on this issue of great importance during the\r\nAssembly’s current session.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nAs we are all aware, a clear consensus exists among\r\nthe Member States on the urgent need for reform of the\r\nstructure and procedures of the Security Council. The broad\r\nparticipation in the Open-ended Working Group and the\r\nlarge number of delegations which touched upon this issue\r\nduring both the general debate and the Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting this year attest to the high\r\npremium which Member States place on this issue.\r\nWe have now come to the end of another year of\r\nintensive discussions. This year’s session of the Working\r\nGroup has seen fruitful results, as we have been able\r\nthoroughly to assess the major issues, enrich the discussion\r\nfurther and, by so doing, identify some areas of\r\nconvergence. Although consensus remains elusive on major\r\nissues, my delegation is encouraged that the Working\r\nGroup is moving in the right direction.\r\nThis year’s report, which was adopted in the Working\r\nGroup and duly noted by the General Assembly on 18\r\nSeptember, illustrates that three broad categories of issues\r\nare currently under discussion in the Working Group. They\r\nare: first, how to restructure the Security Council to achieve\r\nbetter representation of the general membership; second,\r\nhow and to what extent the Council can be democratized\r\nvis-à-vis its decision-making process, including the question\r\nof veto power; and lastly, how to improve the Council’s\r\nworking methods towards greater transparency.\r\nThe report also reveals that, despite wide gaps in the\r\npositions of delegations on most of the hard-core issues,\r\nthere is some convergence of views. First, as the two Vice-\r\nChairmen pointed out, there is clear agreement on the need\r\nto expand the Council to reflect increases in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations to a total size within the\r\nrange of the mid-to-low twenties. Secondly, although no\r\ndelegation opposes an increase in the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Council, the question of increasing the\r\npermanent membership remains a point of controversy.\r\nThirdly, with the exception of a few delegations, most\r\nMember States called for certain measures to restrict the\r\nexercise of veto power, including its scope of application.\r\nFinally, there was quasi-unanimity about the need to\r\nenhance the transparency of the working methods of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation believes that the report and the\r\ncompendium will facilitate our dialogue. As the papers\r\ncontained in the compendium have provided valuable input\r\nin our past discussion, they should continue to serve as a\r\nbasis for the future deliberations of the Working Group.\r\nIt is for this reason that the delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Korea welcomes the decision of the General\r\nAssembly that the Working Group should continue its\r\nwork during the fiftieth session and submit a further\r\nreport before the end of the session.\r\nAt this time, my delegation would like to reiterate its\r\nbasic position on the reform of the Security Council as\r\nfollows.\r\nFirst and foremost, we strongly believe that the final\r\npackage of the reform should be based on consensus\r\namong Member States, in view of the profound impact\r\nthat the package will have on the capacity of the Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations as a whole in the decades\r\nahead. Any decision that lacks the general support of the\r\nMember States will hamper the viability of the United\r\nNations.\r\nSecondly, we believe that better representation\r\nstrengthens the political and moral authority of the\r\nCouncil. It ensures more effective implementation of its\r\ndecisions. It flows from this that the key element of\r\nreform is to bolster the Council’s legitimacy. One of the\r\nbest ways to achieve this objective is to make the Council\r\nmore representative of the general membership, enhance\r\ndemocracy in its decision-making, and improve the\r\ntransparency of its procedures.\r\nThirdly, on the issue relating to the expansion of the\r\nCouncil, a formula must be found which allows better\r\nparticipation in the Security Council of medium and\r\nsmall-sized Member States, which constitute an absolute\r\nmajority of the Member States in the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation has always believed that the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council should incorporate the\r\nfull range of interests and points of view, rather than be\r\ndesigned to accommodate the needs and privileges of\r\nsome select groups of countries. For these reasons, the\r\nenlargement and composition of the Council must reflect\r\nthe universal character of the United Nations and must be\r\nguided by the principle of sovereign equality of States\r\nand equitable geographical distribution.\r\nIn this regard, some concepts advocating the creation\r\nof regional or semi-permanent membership have been\r\nintroduced. In the past, my delegation has expressed its\r\ninterest in the proposals based on these concepts. We\r\nremain interested in these proposals, in the belief that the\r\ncreation of such a membership would be beneficial to\r\nboth small and medium-sized countries.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nFourthly, another equally important aspect that we\r\nshould focus on in the reform exercise relates to the\r\ndecision-making procedures of the Council. We have\r\nalways questioned the continuing relevance of the veto in\r\nthe light of the changed realities of today’s world.\r\nThe veto system is incompatible with the principles of\r\ndemocracy and sovereign equality. While it is true that the\r\nveto has rarely been used in recent times, there are no\r\nassurances that it will not be used again. Moreover, the\r\ninternational community is aware of many instances in\r\nwhich the threat to use the veto, or even the possession of\r\nthat power, influenced the deliberations and decisions of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAs it stands, however, none of the permanent members\r\nis willing to accept the abolition of the veto. Under the\r\ncircumstances, we share the view of those delegations that\r\nadvocate a realistic approach based upon pragmatism. In\r\nthat regard, we are pleased that many proposals designed to\r\nlimit the veto power in its scope and use have already been\r\ntabled, and we believe that the Working Group should\r\ndiscuss them in detail and identify the areas where we can\r\ntake some positive steps.\r\nFifthly, my delegation strongly opposes the extension\r\nof the veto power beyond the five current permanent\r\nmembers. We have in the past repeatedly voiced our strong\r\nopposition to such proliferation. The veto is an\r\nanachronistic institution that should be discarded\r\neventually — definitely not one that should be extended to\r\nother members of the Council.\r\nSixthly, any reform that results only in an enlargement\r\nof membership is not satisfactory to us. Our firm view is\r\nthat a mere change in the size and composition of the\r\nCouncil — one that is not accompanied by some specific\r\nchanges in its working methods — would not be sufficient.\r\nIn this regard, we are pleased that a broad consensus\r\non the need for a more open and transparent Security\r\nCouncil appears to have emerged from the discussions in\r\nthe Working Group, and that some limited but important\r\ninitiatives have already been taken by the Council towards\r\nthat end, as enumerated in the observations and assessment\r\nof the two Vice-Chairmen. However, we believe that much\r\nmore can be done, even without waiting for the finalization\r\nof the reform package, given that in most cases an\r\namendment to the Charter is not required. We urge the\r\nCouncil to respond further to the aspirations of the majority\r\nof the Member States to increased transparency in its\r\nworking methods.\r\nFinally, I should like to share some of my thoughts\r\non how we might best proceed further in the discussion\r\nof the subject before us.\r\nWe believe that the Member States should strive\r\nhard to keep the momentum alive and further facilitate the\r\nprocess, so that a reform package acceptable to all\r\nMember States could emerge at an early stage.\r\nIn closing, I should like to reiterate the Republic of\r\nKorea’s firm commitment to participate actively, with an\r\nopen mind and a constructive spirit, in the deliberations\r\nof the Working Group and to fully cooperate with other\r\ndelegations to achieve consensus.\r\nMr. Pawar (India): Allow me to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Diogo do Freitas Amaral\r\non his election as President of the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation has no doubt that the\r\nwork of the Assembly will proceed smoothly and\r\nproductively under his expert guidance.\r\nAt the recent Summit in Cartagena of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement many important decisions were taken\r\nby its Heads of State and Government in regard to the\r\nexpansion and reform of the Security Council, which will\r\nprovide a beneficial input for the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group in the coming year. The statement of the\r\nAmbassador of Colombia in this regard, giving the\r\ndetails, has the full support of my delegation.\r\nThe report of the Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council has a wealth of\r\ndocumentation annexed to it. This compendium shows\r\nthat in the past two years of extensive discussions we\r\nhave witnessed a rich exchange of ideas and views that\r\ngives us a clear insight into the thinking of the Member\r\nStates. Notably, there are both areas of convergence and\r\nareas of differences on a number of questions related to\r\nthe main issue. However, it is significant that a consensus\r\nexists for an expansion of the Security Council that would\r\nreflect the increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations, especially of developing countries. This is\r\nnecessary to ensure the Council’s legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nMy delegation supports the continuation of the work\r\nof the Working Group on the basis of this important\r\nconsensus decision. We hope that the Group will attempt,\r\nin its further work, to narrow the differences that exist\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nand to make sustained efforts to reach a consensus on\r\nunresolved issues.\r\nIn this context, I should like to quote here from the\r\nstatement made by our Prime Minister before this Assembly\r\non the occasion of the Special Commemorative Meeting to\r\ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\r\n“The United Nations today includes a much\r\nlarger number of independent, sovereign States than\r\nwhen it began. In such a context, the United Nations\r\ncannot afford to be seen as either exclusivist or\r\nincomplete, either in appearance or in outlook. In\r\nparticular, an adequate presence of developing\r\ncountries is needed in the Security Council on the\r\nbasis of objective criteria: nations of the world must\r\nfeel that their stakes in global peace and prosperity are\r\nfactored into United Nations decision-making”.\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 40th meeting, p. 45)\r\nThe existing imbalances in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council arise from the exclusion from\r\nrepresentation of an overwhelming segment of the world\r\npopulation: that residing in the developing countries. Any\r\nproposal that accentuates this imbalance obviously will not\r\nenjoy consensus. As has been made clear in the Cartagena\r\nDeclaration of the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nany attempt to exclude non-aligned countries from any\r\nexpansion in membership of the Security Council, including\r\npermanent membership, would be unacceptable to the\r\nMovement.\r\nWe believe that the expansion of the membership of\r\nthe Council in the category of permanent members should\r\nbe decided upon on the basis of agreed criteria for\r\nselection. Once criteria are agreed upon, the decision on\r\nnew permanent members should be made globally by the\r\nmembership of the United Nations. We have, in the course\r\nof the deliberations of the Working Group, suggested\r\ncertain criteria, such as population, contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations system, support and participation in peace-\r\nkeeping, and potential for a regional and global role. Other\r\ncriteria have been mentioned by other countries. We believe\r\nthat it would be beneficial for the Group to analyse these\r\nsuggestions and come up with an acceptable set of criteria\r\nagainst which the claims of each country could be assessed.\r\nOn the basis of such criteria, some countries will clearly\r\nqualify for permanent membership. We believe that India\r\nwill be among them.\r\nAs we have stated on several occasions, the\r\nexpansion of the Council and its reform should be\r\nconsidered as integral parts of a common package, taking\r\ninto account the need for transparency in the decision-\r\nmaking process. We welcome the Working Group’s\r\ndecision that the final agreement on cluster I and cluster\r\nII issues should comprise a comprehensive package.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to assure the Assembly\r\nthat India will continue to participate actively and in a\r\nconstructive manner in the discussions within the\r\nWorking Group in a constructive manner.\r\nMr. Eitel (Germany): For the third consecutive time,\r\nthe General Assembly is discussing the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. Last year, we spoke\r\nbefore the General Assembly and expressed our thanks to\r\nthe Chairman of the informal Working Group and to both\r\nVice-Chairmen for their outstanding work during the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nToday I shall take this opportunity to thank the\r\nChairman of the informal Working Group during the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly, Foreign\r\nMinister Essy, and the two Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador\r\nBreitenstein and Ambassador Pibulsonggram, for their\r\nexcellent work. In particular, I would like to express my\r\nthanks to the two Vice-Chairmen for their accurate\r\nassessment of the progress achieved by the informal\r\nWorking Group and for the proposals set forth in their\r\nreport, which has been circulated as an official document.\r\nWe regret that Ambassador Pibulsonggram will be\r\nleaving. Let me use this opportunity to thank him again\r\nfor his untiring efforts to guide and conduct the work of\r\nthe Group. We hope that a successor can be found as\r\nsoon as possible. Like the great majority of Member\r\nStates, we are opposed to further changes in the Bureau\r\nof the Working Group because this cannot but affect the\r\nwork of all working groups. I am sure we all have the\r\ngreatest interest in progress being made in the Working\r\nGroup on an Agenda for Development as well as in the\r\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial\r\nSituation of the United Nations.\r\nI see our task of restructuring the Security Council\r\nas comparable to the renovation of a huge house whose\r\nroof has suffered damage from storms. Therefore, the\r\nattic and roof must be rebuilt and strengthened to once\r\nagain be able to cope with bad weather to come. During\r\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly we\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nanswered the questions of why we thought it necessary to\r\nrebuild the attic and what kind of reconstruction we had in\r\nmind. During the last session — the forty-ninth session —\r\nof the General Assembly, we consulted several architects\r\nand weighed the pros and cons of their proposals. Now,\r\nduring the fiftieth session, the anniversary session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we have to take the third step and select\r\nthe proposal which is the most adequate and suitable. This\r\ndecision will not be an easy one. But I am convinced that\r\nwe will be successful. I am optimistic for three reasons.\r\nFirst, we have no time to lose. We will not be able to\r\nmeet the challenges facing our Organization unless the\r\nUnited Nations house has a repaired and stable roof and\r\nattic. Any damage to the roof affects the house as a whole.\r\nThose who have carefully followed the general debate of\r\nthis session of the General Assembly and the statements\r\nmade during the fiftieth-anniversary celebration know that\r\nthere continues to be consensus about the urgent need to\r\nreform.\r\nSecondly, we know what we are aiming at in\r\nrebuilding the attic. We want an attic which is easily\r\naccessible and which has many means of access to the\r\nother floors. In other words, the Member States should have\r\nthe opportunity to be represented on the Council more\r\nfrequently. We want the attic to be large in all four\r\ndirections. This also applies to those who live on this floor.\r\nNo one shall be excluded. In other words, all world regions\r\nshould be equitably represented on the Council. In\r\nparticular, the regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean States need stronger representation. We\r\ndo not favour an undemocratic architectural plan for the\r\nenlargement of the Council which excludes States or groups\r\nof States from the outset.\r\nWe want to ensure the upkeep of the attic. The attic\r\nof a house suffers particularly from strong weather and\r\nstorms. It needs experienced inhabitants who have reliable\r\nequipment and special tools to maintain it. In other words,\r\ncountries that are able and willing to contribute on a global\r\nscale to the maintenance of peace and security and that\r\nhave already taken on large responsibilities regarding\r\ninternational development and United Nations activities\r\nshould be permanently represented on the Council. We, and\r\nwith us a large number of other Member States, believe that\r\nGermany is one of these countries. The attic should not be\r\nclosed off or have an impervious concrete floor. I have\r\nspoken already of the need for many means of access. It\r\nmust be bright and have skylights. In other words, the\r\nCouncil’s work must be carried out in an open and\r\ntransparent manner to enable non-members to receive all\r\nthe information they require. Some progress has already\r\nbeen achieved in this context. During the German\r\npresidency of the Council we tried to live up to this task.\r\nNevertheless, much still needs to be done.\r\nThere is no space left in the house for additional\r\nfloors, special ante-rooms or special entries. We are not\r\naiming at a completely new architecture with new classes\r\nof inhabitants. We prefer a thorough renovation of the\r\nhouse that we know and cherish. In other words, models\r\nof rotation, which received the support during the recent\r\ngeneral debate of less than 3 per cent of Member States,\r\nare no alternative or, at best, a bad one and would create\r\nmore problems than they could solve.\r\nThirdly, we have now a more than sufficient number\r\nof recommendations, opinions and reports on the\r\nrebuilding. On the part of the United Nations there are the\r\nreport of the informal Working Group and the\r\nobservations and the assessment by the Vice-Chairmen of\r\nthe progress of its work. I congratulate the Vice-Chairmen\r\non their judicious observations regarding the important\r\nprogress made. I associate myself fully with their\r\nsuggestions and their belief that Member States must aim\r\nat substantial achievements during the current, fiftieth,\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nTwo other important United Nations documents, both\r\nissued on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, lend momentum to the reform of the\r\nCouncil: The Declaration of the Member States and\r\nObservers of 24 October 1995, representing the peoples\r\nof the world, and the statement of the Security Council\r\nadopted at its meeting at ministerial level under the Italian\r\npresidency on 26 September 1995. Both documents call\r\nfor the reform of the Council.\r\nFrom the Member States themselves we have the\r\nstatements made during the recent general debate and the\r\nanniversary meeting. The statements show a clear\r\ntendency in favour of enlarging the Council. The\r\nparliamentarians of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)\r\nat the special session of the Inter-Parliamentary Council\r\nin New York marking the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, adopted a declaration entitled “A\r\nParliamentary Vision for International Cooperation into\r\nthe Twenty-First Century”. This declaration calls for a\r\nreform of the Security Council to make it more\r\nrepresentative while at the same time maintaining its\r\nauthority and effectiveness.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nSome important and well-recognized groups of States\r\nhave issued joint statements. I would like to mention,\r\namong others, the non-aligned countries at their recent\r\nSummit, the Nordic States and the informal group of small\r\nand medium-sized countries. In a solemn declaration on the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, the European Council, at its summit\r\nmeeting in Cannes last June, unanimously called on the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States to pursue and\r\ndevelop the reform programme under way and to make\r\nfurther progress in adapting United Nations structures and\r\ninstitutions, including the Security Council, to present\r\ncircumstances.\r\nFinally, several comprehensive studies on reform\r\nquestions have been published by independent experts this\r\nyear. As one example of many I may mention the\r\nQureshi-von Weizsäcker report, which deals explicitly\r\nwith reform of the Council. We must make good use of\r\nthe momentum created. It will not last forever. Let us\r\ntake advantage of the window of opportunity that is now\r\nopen.\r\nWe agree with the observation, made by the Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Working Group and by numerous other\r\nStates, that the time has come to move on to the next\r\nphase of the work — that is, to a process of actual\r\nnegotiations aimed at achieving a single, comprehensive\r\nagreement. The decisive question that we shall have to\r\nanswer is this: will the future composition of the Council\r\nbenefit the Organization and the international community\r\nof States? So far as my country and its readiness to serve\r\nthe United Nations as a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council are concerned, I am not afraid of the\r\nanswer to this question. The United Nations can count on\r\nGermany.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall continue our\r\nconsideration of item 47 this afternoon, starting at 3\r\no’clock. As was announced earlier, some 70 delegations\r\nare listed to take part in the debate on this item. As we\r\nhave heard only nine at this meeting, I again appeal for\r\nbrevity. Delegations are requested to ensure, if at all\r\npossible, that statements do not exceed 10 minutes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
