(Portugal)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Pibulsonggram\r\n(Thailand), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 47 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform the\r\nAssembly that the representatives of Burundi and Namibia\r\nhave requested to participate in the debate on this item.\r\nInasmuch as the list of speakers was closed today at\r\nnoon, may I ask the Assembly whether there is any\r\nobjection to the inclusion of Burundi and Namibia in the\r\nlist of speakers?\r\nThere is no objection. Burundi and Namibia are\r\ntherefore included in the list of speakers.\r\nMr. Cárdenas (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Almost two years have gone by since resolution\r\n48/26 established the Open-ended Working Group to\r\nconsider all aspects of the functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil. That Group, presided over by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and wisely guided by Ambassadors\r\nWilhelm Breitenstein of Finland and Nitya Pibulsonggram\r\nof Thailand, has worked intensively this year.\r\nWe are especially grateful for the distribution to the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the compendium of documents and\r\nobservations of the Vice-Chairmen. The documents,\r\nreferred to as clusters I and II, served as a well-ordered\r\nbasis for channelling our recent discussions and for giving\r\nstructure to the Working Group’s final report.\r\nThe Argentine delegation, which participated actively\r\nin the meetings held this year, submitted to the Working\r\nGroup an “evolving” document intended to stimulate\r\nconsideration of the item; at the suggestion of a number\r\nof delegations it was annexed to the compendium\r\ncontained in document A/49/965. Our presentation related\r\nto what was graphically called the “cascade effect” of the\r\nstatus of permanent membership of the Security Council.\r\nThe single, modest, intention of our document was to\r\nsound a warning concerning the profound collateral\r\neffects on the entire United Nations system of the\r\npossible expansion of the number of permanent members.\r\nOwing to its importance, this matter is worth pondering.\r\nWe believe that an expansion of the permanent\r\nmembership should not merely install new chairs in the\r\nSecurity Council Chamber, but should go much further.\r\nThe document draws attention to the many other related\r\ndecisions to which we must also give much thought. One\r\nof the most important of these is without question\r\nexpansion of the membership of the International Court of\r\nJustice. Each of the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil has to date always had a member on the Hague\r\nCourt, even though there is no provision to that effect in\r\nthe Statue of the Court.\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nReform of the Security Council, the paramount organ\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, does not have institutional implications only; it\r\nalso poses a broad challenge that must be addressed with\r\nmuch care and wisdom, without haste and with great\r\ncaution. The question is too important for us to take\r\ndecisions lightly and run the risk of error.\r\nAs my Foreign Minister recently told the General\r\nAssembly, the basic element of the reform is the need to\r\nsafeguard and improve the efficiency and flexibility of the\r\nwork of the Security Council. Given the necessary\r\nconsensus, any expansion of the Security Council must be\r\nvery cautious, restrained and limited. In our view, such an\r\nexpansion could be based on a new, imaginative mechanism\r\naimed at achieving greater representativity, which through\r\nrotation formulas would make possible more frequent\r\ninclusion on the Council of countries with the greatest\r\ndesire to serve the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, without — and I lay particular emphasis on this —\r\nresulting in arbitrary exclusions and the concomitant\r\nestablishment of new privileges that would further\r\nundermine equity.\r\nIn that connection we have heard this year a number\r\nof innovative proposals that through rotation would ensure\r\na more frequent presence in the Council of a larger number\r\nof States. Such a scheme would also permit easier access to\r\nthe Council by countries that must now wait many long\r\nyears before they can aspire to a seat on the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn our view it is vital to take account of the\r\ndifferences between the situation in 1945, which led to the\r\nexistence of permanent seats on the Security Council, and\r\nthe current international situation. In today’s far more\r\ntransparent, open and democratic world, we must favour\r\nsolutions that are — and I stress this — less rigid and less\r\nauthoritarian in order to adapt the Security Council to our\r\ntimes.\r\nWe must be particularly careful when we speak of the\r\nnotion of regional representation, which is strictly speaking\r\nalien to the Charter of the United Nations. Future\r\ngenerations could question the capricious criterion of\r\nregionally based representativity, which some in this\r\nOrganization have recently set forth with respect to reform\r\nof the Security Council. Each geographical region has its\r\nown characteristics and idiosyncrasies. We therefore believe\r\nthat it could be arbitrary to try to establish a single and\r\nuniversal set of new parameters for representation, to be\r\napplicable to all continents.\r\nWe must ask the question of whether we still\r\npossess the momentum we thought existed to motivate in-\r\ndepth reform of the Security Council. In the judgement of\r\nmy delegation, the specific matter of expansion of the\r\npermanent membership does not seem to enjoy the\r\nminimum consensus necessary to put it into practice. That\r\nmomentum will exist, or will return, when, after calm and\r\ncareful thought we begin to consider conclusions and\r\ndebate the options for an equitable solution of the\r\nquestion before us. We must not be obsessed with the\r\nidea of the “propitious moment”, or the “challenge\r\nimposed upon us” by the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. There must be no artificial deadlines:\r\nreform of the Security Council is too important and too\r\ncomplicated, and has consequences that are too serious\r\nfor the international community.\r\nWe must recognize, on the other hand, that there has\r\nlately been considerable progress in the transparency and\r\nopenness of the work of the Council. The current\r\npredictable and well-organized meetings between Council\r\nmembers and troop-contributing countries surely\r\nconstitute a most significant area of progress in the sphere\r\nof peace-keeping operations. Yet this procedure, originally\r\nproposed by New Zealand and Argentina, should be\r\nsubject to ongoing review, as we believe it could be\r\nimproved. Specifically, we think that the format of this\r\nmechanism should be formalized in deference to the\r\nresponsibility of troop contributors to their own societies,\r\nincluding their Governments and their parliaments.\r\nWith respect to transparency, there is great room for\r\nimprovement in the procedures of the Security Council.\r\nLast year, the French delegation proposed more frequent\r\nformal meetings, an idea noted by the Council through a\r\npresidential statement. And during Argentina’s presidency,\r\nin January, 10 months ago, the Council considered the\r\npaper of the Secretary-General on a Supplement to “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” in a formal meeting, before discussing\r\nit in informal meetings. Yet we have not repeated that\r\nvery rich experience.\r\nDuring its presidency Argentina also held, for the\r\nfirst time, daily briefings for delegations not members of\r\nthe Security Council on the work of the Council,\r\nincluding reports on what had taken place in informal\r\nconsultations.\r\nAll of this reflects the importance that the Argentine\r\nRepublic attaches to transparency and openness in the\r\nwork of the Security Council. It also indicates the role\r\nthat non-permanent members of the Council can play in\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\npromoting change that will strengthen the legitimacy and\r\nrepresentativity of the Security Council vis-à-vis the other\r\nmembers of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Owada (Japan): The fiftieth anniversary of the\r\ncreation of the United Nations, coming as it did in the\r\nmidst of the structural changes that are taking place in the\r\nworld in the wake of the end of the cold war, has offered\r\nus a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role\r\nof the United Nations in the contemporary international\r\nsystem. The need to strengthen the Organization and to\r\nimprove its functioning as the centre of action for the peace\r\nand stability of the world is keenly felt by a great number\r\nof the States that constitute the United Nations.\r\nOne focal point of our attention in this regard,\r\nneedless to say, is the problem of how to enhance the\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council as the\r\nprincipal United Nations organ responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security. Thus, in their statements\r\nat the recent Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as in the Assembly’s general debate\r\nat the present session, an overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States referred to the need to reform the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThose statements were testimony to our enormous\r\nexpectations with respect to the role to be played by the\r\nUnited Nations in the new world that is now emerging. It\r\nis essential that we seize the momentum that has thus been\r\ngenerated, so that we may make tangible progress towards\r\ngenuine reform during this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nJapan has enunciated its basic position on Security\r\nCouncil reform in various forums of this Organization, in\r\nparticular in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. In Japan’s view, the\r\nprimary objective of our exercise should be to strengthen\r\nthe functioning of the Council by enhancing its legitimacy\r\nand effectiveness. In order to attain this objective, the\r\nreform package should include the following elements: first,\r\nin order to ensure the effectiveness of the Council, it seems\r\nessential that a limited increase in its permanent\r\nmembership should be implemented by the inclusion of\r\ncountries which have both the capacity and the willingness\r\nto assume global responsibilities for world peace and\r\nstability.\r\nOn this score, many Member States have expressed\r\ntheir support for the addition of specific countries,\r\nincluding my own, as permanent members. In addition,\r\nthe expanded permanent membership might also include\r\nthose countries from the developing regions of the world\r\nwhich meet the qualifications I have mentioned, if\r\nMember States generally can agree on their selection.\r\nSecondly, in view of the dramatically expanded\r\nmembership of the United Nations as a whole, it is\r\nnecessary to enhance the representativeness of the\r\nSecurity Council by adding an appropriate number of\r\nnon-permanent seats. At the same time, my delegation\r\nbelieves that in carrying out this task a balance between\r\nthe need for enhanced legitimacy and the need for\r\nincreased effectiveness must be struck. In the light of this\r\nconsideration, the total membership of an expanded\r\nSecurity Council, which should include an increase in\r\nboth permanent and non-permanent seats, would have to\r\nbe kept in the low twenties.\r\nThirdly, in considering the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil, the geographical imbalance that exists now in the\r\nmembership of the Council as a whole should be\r\nredressed, with particular attention given to the\r\nrepresentation of Asia, Africa and Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nIn this connection, my country has stated on a\r\nnumber of occasions that Japan, with the endorsement of\r\nmany countries, is prepared to discharge its\r\nresponsibilities as a permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil in accordance with its basic philosophy regarding\r\ninternational contributions, including the non-resort to the\r\nuse of force prohibited by its Constitution.\r\nFinally, it goes without saying that the reform should\r\nalso address the problem of how to improve the Council’s\r\nworking methods, including enhancement of the\r\ntransparency of its work. Much progress towards\r\nimprovement is already under way on this score, but the\r\nfinal outcome should be integrated in the form of a single\r\ncomprehensive package which would cover both of the\r\ntwo aspects of the reform, namely the expansion of the\r\nCouncil and the improvement of its working methods.\r\nAt the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, the Prime Minister of\r\nJapan, Tomiichi Murayama, emphasized that on this issue\r\nof the reform of the Security Council it is now time for\r\naction. Japan believes that Member States should now\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nproceed to work expeditiously to reach agreement on a\r\nbroad framework of reform by the end of the current\r\nsession of the General Assembly in September 1996.\r\nAs we proceed in the weeks and months ahead on this\r\npath of seeking agreement on the specific modalities of the\r\nreform of the Security Council, it is the considered view of\r\nmy delegation that we should keep two dimensions of our\r\nwork in mind.\r\nThe first dimension relates to the nature of the\r\nexercise in the Working Group at this juncture in its work.\r\nIn the course of our discussion so far we have already\r\ncovered a lot of ground. General agreement seems to have\r\nbeen achieved on the need to expand the membership of the\r\nCouncil as well as to further improve its working methods.\r\nFurthermore, a number of concrete proposals and\r\nsuggestions have been put on the table. Different ideas have\r\nbeen floated on ways to overcome conflicting interests and\r\npractical difficulties that stand in the way of finding an\r\nacceptable formula on a number of issues. Building on that\r\nprogress, my delegation is convinced that it is high time we\r\nintensified our efforts to reach agreement on a concrete\r\nformula for expanding the Security Council membership by\r\nentering into the negotiating stage for arriving at an overall\r\npackage. It is important to avoid the repetition of our past\r\ndiscussions. While trying to promote a convergence of\r\nviews, we should now proceed to negotiate a concrete\r\nreform package.\r\nThe second dimension of our task relates to the\r\nproblem of what working method should be employed in\r\nthe Open-Ended Working Group. I should like to suggest\r\nthat the Working Group pursue its activities in a more\r\nefficient manner. For example, one avenue to explore in\r\nthis respect would be the possibility of holding informal\r\nconsultations more frequently, while maintaining the\r\ntransparency of the Working Group’s work. Again, and still\r\nwith a view to facilitating agreement, it might be useful to\r\nconsider the institution of a series of intensive negotiating\r\nsessions in which the participation of high-level\r\nrepresentatives from the various capitals could inject an\r\nelement of each country’s political judgement at the highest\r\nlevel. With a view to exploring various new and innovative\r\nideas to expedite the process in which we have been\r\nengaged for the past two years, the Bureau should\r\ncommence in the course of this session a process of\r\ninformal consultations to identify the most effective ways\r\nto take our work a step further and bring us to a new level\r\nof genuine negotiations while building on our past\r\nachievements.\r\nClearly, the reform of the Security Council is one of\r\nthe most urgent tasks we must achieve if we are seriously\r\ndetermined to strengthen the United Nations. Should\r\nMember States fail to reach concrete agreement on this\r\nall-important task in the near future the credibility of the\r\nOrganization would be severely undermined. My\r\ndelegation feels very strongly that each and every\r\nMember State should recognize our collective\r\nresponsibility to sustain and reinforce the Organization,\r\nwhich is so indispensable for the maintenance of peace\r\nand stability in the present-day world. To meet this\r\ncollective responsibility we all must redouble our efforts\r\nto realize a genuine reform, with commitment and in\r\npartnership. The future of the United Nations depends on\r\nour efforts.\r\nMs. Menon (Singapore): Allow me to begin by\r\nthanking His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, the President\r\nof the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, for\r\nhis guidance during that session as Chairman of the\r\nOpen-Ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil. I should like to assure the President of the\r\npresent session of our full cooperation as he now assumes\r\nthis role.\r\nWe congratulate Ambassador Wilhelm Breitenstein\r\nof Finland and Ambassador Nitya Pibulsonggram of\r\nThailand on their sterling work as Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group. In particular, we thank them for guiding\r\nus in the preparation of the Working Group’s report\r\ncontained in document A/49/47 and of its compendium\r\ncontained in document A/49/965. Those documents have\r\naccurately captured the richness and range of our\r\nexchanges. They form useful references to the views of\r\nMember States and to the variety of concrete proposals\r\nthat have been advanced.\r\nAs the Working Group begins its third year of work\r\nit is appropriate to take stock of our progress and see how\r\nwe proceed from here. The pace of work in the Working\r\nGroup has occasioned some comment, not all favourable.\r\nBut, in my delegation’s view, the process of the last two\r\nyears has been both necessary and fruitful.\r\nFirst, the Working Group process has clarified many\r\nof the complex and interlinked issues. Secondly, specific\r\nproposals on how to reform the Security Council have\r\nemerged and are now on the table for further discussion.\r\nThirdly, the positions of many Member States have risen\r\ncloser to the surface and are now more defined. Fourthly,\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nin my delegation’s statement on this item last year we\r\nurged that there must be political will and that priority must\r\nbe given to this issue in capitals in order to push ahead. If\r\nthe statements at the Special Commemorative Meeting last\r\nmonth are any guide, the attention of our leaders and\r\ncapitals has been engaged. At least, we hope so.\r\nIn other words, the exercise has shifted away from\r\ngeneralities and is entering a substantive stage of\r\nnegotiations. The next stage in the work of the Working\r\nGroup is therefore both crucial and delicate.\r\nIt is clearly important to maintain and enhance our\r\nforward momentum to build on the progress we have\r\nforged. At the same time, precisely because we are now\r\nfocused on specific and substantive issues and national\r\npositions are engaged, it is essential to proceed with some\r\ndeliberation. A misstep at this stage could cripple the\r\nprocess.\r\nHow do we take account of the different sensitivities\r\nwithout paralysing the discussion? We must recognize the\r\npolitical reality of differing opinions while preserving the\r\nclimate of dialogue and cooperation that we have so far\r\nenjoyed, and move forward. We need political vision,\r\ncoupled with circumspection, finesse and sensitivity. This\r\nwill not be easy, but it is not impossible. To achieve it, we\r\nmust first acknowledge the challenge.\r\nThis is why my delegation has consistently advocated\r\na criteria-based approach to Security Council reform. We\r\nhave suggested some criteria, which have been incorporated\r\ninto the compendium in document A/49/965. The specific\r\ncriteria that we have suggested are obviously neither\r\ndefinitive nor exhaustive. Like everything else, they are\r\nopen for discussion. The more important point my\r\ndelegation wishes to emphasize is methodological. We\r\nbelieve that a criteria-based approach is the most politically\r\nneutral means of advancing this important issue.\r\nWhatever the approach adopted, my delegation pledges\r\nto do its best to support the Working Group actively. We\r\nintend to remain engaged in and to contribute constructively\r\nto the Working Group and the others. Security Council\r\nreform is an important and integral component of the entire\r\npackage of forward-looking reforms needed to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations and to prepare it for the challenges of\r\nthe next century.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly has\r\nbeen meeting for two years. Some may find the progress\r\nachieved slow, but the complexity and importance of its\r\nmandate justify its being so.\r\nAs is natural and logical, areas of agreement and of\r\ndisagreement have taken shape throughout the debates.\r\nThere appears to be general support for an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. The conclusions of\r\nthe most recent report of the Working Group also\r\ncontained a set of principles and concepts that should\r\nprovide the raison d’être and objective of the reform.\r\nIn addition to the principles of sovereign equality,\r\nequitable geographical distribution and contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the\r\nother objectives of the Organization, the report reflects\r\nthe widespread desire for greater transparency, legitimacy,\r\neffectiveness, efficiency and democracy in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWhat should be the appropriate number of additional\r\nmembers? Which of the categories could be expanded?\r\nThe Working Group still has no common response to\r\nthese questions. How will the principles and concepts we\r\nhave been discussing so far be defined? What is the\r\nappropriate combination of criteria for attaining the shared\r\nobjectives we are pursuing? What, in short, are the ways\r\nto and conditions for a viable reform that will be\r\nacceptable to all?\r\nAll Member States have benefited from the debate\r\nin the Working Group. We have all learned something.\r\nWe have adjusted our original views of the problems and\r\nchanged our approaches, but we have also reaffirmed our\r\nconvictions on various aspects of the reform.\r\nMexico remains profoundly convinced that it is\r\nimperative not to repeat the mistakes of 1945. We have\r\nbeen told, as the report states, that important changes are\r\ntaking place in international relations. The list of these\r\nchanges could be endless; some of them relate to the\r\nissue now before us, while others do not. For us, the\r\nquestion is whether it can be claimed that the\r\ncircumstances that made it possible in San Francisco for\r\nfive countries to have a privileged position in our\r\nOrganization exist today. Interdependence, globalization\r\nand shared responsibility are concepts that lead us directly\r\nto the answer that they do not.\r\nCan we claim that the principle of sovereign equality\r\nwill be strengthened by granting privileges and\r\nprerogatives to other countries? We do not understand\r\nhow, by introducing new inequalities, we are going to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nmake fully applicable this essential principle of relations\r\nbetween States, which, moreover, we solemnly reaffirmed\r\non 24 October last.\r\nBy introducing new discriminatory elements will we\r\nbe able to improve the representativeness and legitimacy of\r\nthe Council’s actions? Yes, more members are needed, but\r\nwithout new imbalances. Legitimacy will be fully achieved\r\nthrough decisions that are faithful to the principles of the\r\nCharter and the norms of international law. Thus will the\r\nmoral authority and credibility of the Council take firm\r\nroot.\r\nIt has been said that five new permanent members\r\ncould be added to the Security Council. Explicitly or\r\nimplicitly, this is the figure most often mentioned.\r\nAccording to these proposals, of the 10 permanent members\r\nthat the Security Council would eventually have, 4 would\r\ncome from the Group of Western European and Other\r\nStates, 3 from Asia, 1 from Eastern Europe, 1 from Africa\r\nand 1 from Latin America and the Caribbean. Can anyone\r\nclaim that this distribution genuinely reflects the objective\r\nof equitable geographical representation?\r\nMoreover, if it is a question of geographical\r\nrepresentation, can we contemplate representation that does\r\nnot correspond to the will and enjoy the consent of the\r\ngeographical region that is supposed to be represented? In\r\nany event, the regional groups will have to play an essential\r\nrole in decisions of this kind.\r\nIn a Security Council with new permanent members,\r\neach enjoying privileges and prerogatives, can anyone say\r\nwith certainty that the process of consultation, coordination\r\nand decision-making will be more effective and more\r\nefficient? How will this contribute to transparency?\r\nWith regard to the veto, can we unhesitatingly assert\r\nthat by inalterably maintaining this privilege and, moreover,\r\nby extending it to other States we are making progress\r\ntowards the democratization of the United Nations? Since\r\n1945, Mexico has maintained that the veto is an anti-\r\ndemocratic institution. It should not be forgotten that in\r\nSan Francisco there was no general agreement in this\r\nregard. Paragraph 3 of Article 27 of the Charter was\r\nadopted by a vote of 30 in favour and 2 against, with 15\r\nabstentions. None of us is unaware that this provision was\r\nput forward as a sine qua non condition for the\r\nestablishment of our Organization in circumstances that, as\r\nI have already said, no longer exist.\r\nJust as in 1945, 50 years later there is still no\r\nagreement — witness the countless proposals put forward\r\naimed at limiting the veto. We ourselves have said that it\r\nshould be confined to issues under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter and that two negative votes by permanent\r\nmembers should be required to block a decision. Those\r\nmeasures would indeed move us towards greater\r\ndemocracy in the United Nations.\r\nIn the draft resolution recommended by the Working\r\nGroup, we have agreed to work towards general\r\nagreement. Moreover, from the legal standpoint, we must\r\ndraw up a blueprint for reform that enjoys the support of\r\ntwo thirds of the members of the General Assembly —\r\n124 States — and that, in addition, is ratified, in\r\naccordance with their respective constitutional processes,\r\nby two thirds of the Member States, including all the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. Does the\r\nreality of Article 108 not compel us to be objective and\r\nrealistic?\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAll these considerations have guided Mexico’s\r\nparticipation in the discussions on this subject, and on this\r\nbasis the Government of Mexico submitted in April 1995\r\na proposal for increasing the number of members of the\r\nSecurity Council. The main elements of that proposal are\r\nthe following: first, the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil would increase from 15 to 20 countries; secondly,\r\nthere would be no increase in the number of permanent\r\nmembers, because, in our view, the five stipulated in the\r\nSan Francisco Charter are more than enough; thirdly, two\r\nMember States would alternate, every two years, in\r\noccupying a non-permanent seat, in recognition of the role\r\nthey play in the Organization; fourthly, there would be\r\none additional seat for Africa, one for Asia and one for\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, while another seat\r\nwould be rotated every two years between Eastern and\r\nWestern European countries; and, fifthly, the competence\r\nof the regional groups in considering and deciding on the\r\nallocation of the seats assigned to their respective regions\r\nwould be strengthened.\r\nThat is the essence of our proposal. We are\r\nconvinced that it is realistic, objective and, above all,\r\nviable.\r\nAs for the future, Mexico supports the Working\r\nGroup’s decision to continue its work. On the basis of the\r\nideas we have expressed, we are aware that imposing\r\nsolutions is not the answer. Work will have to continue\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nand efforts will have to be redoubled to make progress\r\ntowards a convergence and unanimity of views. Mexico is\r\nconvinced that with tenacity and patience, not haste, we\r\nwill move ahead in shaping the reform of the organ on\r\nwhich we, the Member States, have conferred the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Fowler (Canada) (interpretation from French): I\r\nwould like to thank the President of the General Assembly\r\nfor assuming, as did his predecessor, the chairmanship of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council. The two Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Working Group who are assisting him in\r\nthat task — you, Mr. Acting President, whose forthcoming\r\ndeparture we shall regret, and, of course, Ambassador\r\nBreitenstein of Finland — accomplished remarkable work\r\nduring the forty-ninth session, for which we are grateful.\r\nThe Working Group did considerable work during the\r\nforty-ninth session. The publication of a compendium report\r\nincluding, inter alia, the personal observations and\r\nassessment of the Vice-Chairmen, as well as various\r\ndocuments presented by Member States, will stimulate our\r\nthinking and help us focus our work.\r\nAs we have stated in the past, Canada attaches great\r\nimportance to the effectiveness, credibility and legitimacy\r\nof the Council. Some of the questions in this regard fall\r\nunder the heading of “other matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil”, as contained in cluster II of the Working Group’s\r\nagenda. These questions are fundamental for the Council to\r\nbe able to fulfil its Charter mandate for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and progress in this field\r\nshould not be dependent upon the rest of the work done in\r\nthe Working Group.\r\nWe are pleased with the advances achieved by the\r\nCouncil in increasing the transparency of its work, as well\r\nas its consultations with non-members of the Council,\r\nespecially with troop-contributing countries. We strongly\r\nencourage the Council to pursue this path, and we again\r\nurge that the various measures adopted by the Council in\r\nrecent months, notably with regard to consultations with\r\ntroop-contributing countries, be institutionalized.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn this connection, the report of the Government of\r\nCanada on a rapid-reaction capability for the United\r\nNations, presented to the General Assembly last September,\r\ncontains concrete recommendations, some of which\r\ndeserve discussion in the Working Group. Member States\r\nwill be more disposed to furnish troops to the United\r\nNations when they are in a position to participate in the\r\ndiscussions on the definition, implementation and renewal\r\nof mandates, as well as on the political direction of\r\noperations at critical moments in their existence.\r\nWe are alluding in particular to the creation of a\r\ntroop-contributors committee for each operation, which\r\ncould be set up when contributors are approached on the\r\nquestion of participation, even before the formal approval\r\nof an operation by the Council, in order to ensure a rapid\r\nUnited Nations reaction. This idea is in fact mentioned in\r\nparagraph 25 of the Vice-Chairmen’s document. The\r\nSecurity Council would thus have the assurance that\r\npotential troop contributors took a favourable view of the\r\nproposed operation.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks on this theme, I\r\nwould like to add an observation on the effectiveness and\r\ncredibility of the Council, which have, unfortunately, been\r\neroded by the Council’s difficulties in the implementation\r\nof certain decisions. We believe the Council, and\r\nespecially its permanent members, needs to pay closer\r\nattention to the nature and scope of its decisions and to\r\nthe material and financial resources and political support\r\nprovided to the United Nations. This would go a long\r\nway towards restoring the credibility which is essential to\r\nthe Council’s effective fulfilment of its important\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nPermit me now to turn to the question of\r\nenlargement of the Council.\r\nAfter two years of discussions, important differences\r\ncontinue to exist on key issues, as the Working Group’s\r\nreport correctly indicates. Paramount among these issues\r\nis the addition of new permanent members. From a\r\ncareful reading the of Vice-Chairmen’s document, this\r\nseems to have become more, rather than less, problematic,\r\nhowever desirable it may be to respond to several\r\ncountries’ understandable aspirations to such a status. It\r\nseems difficult not to conclude that the addition of new\r\npermanent members faces significant hurdles in the short\r\nrun, and even more so when the Working Group has\r\nexamined only in preliminary fashion the thorny question\r\nof extending the power of veto to possible new permanent\r\nmembers.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nNevertheless, since the Group began its work, Canada\r\nhas indicated that it is open to examining all proposals\r\nregarding enlargement, whether for new members, new\r\ncategories or, indeed, the composition of regional groups.\r\nA year ago in the debate on this subject, my predecessor\r\nremarked,\r\n“We think that the concept of semi-permanent\r\nseats, to be shared for two-year periods by two or\r\nmore countries, is particularly interesting and warrants\r\nfurther exploration. The creation of such a category\r\nwould have the double advantage of allowing\r\ncountries that more fully meet the requirements of\r\nArticle 23 of the Charter to sit more frequently on the\r\nCouncil and of lessening the number of candidates for\r\nnon-permanent member status.” (Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 30th meeting, p. 19)\r\nThis idea may not respond fully to all concerns, but\r\nwe believe it continues to merit further exploration as part\r\nof our search for a solution likely to attract widespread\r\nsupport.\r\nDuring his statement in the general debate this year,\r\nour Foreign Minister, the Honourable André Ouellet, stated\r\nthat it would be useful to initiate a fuller reflection on what\r\nconstitutes a contribution by Member States to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the\r\nother purposes of the Organization, as set out in Article 23.\r\nSeveral Member States have given some idea of what they\r\nhave in mind. For our part, Canada considers that respect\r\nfor the Charter, participation in peace-keeping operations,\r\npayment in full, on time and without any conditions of\r\nregular and peace-keeping budget assessments, the\r\ncommitment of States to arms control and disarmament,\r\nrecourse to the peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\nhumanitarian assistance, economic and social development\r\nassistance, respect for human rights, and promotion of civil\r\nsociety, must be among the key determining considerations\r\nin this regard. As Minister Ouellet said, an understanding\r\namong Member States along these lines would help in the\r\nselection of non-permanent members, whether on the\r\nexisting basis or on a modified basis. We look forward to\r\nhearing views from many others on these aspects when\r\ndiscussions resume in the Working Group.\r\nSecondly, as the Charter indicates, account should also\r\nbe taken of equitable geographic distribution.\r\nI wish to assure the President and all other\r\nparticipants of Canada’s full and active cooperation once\r\nthe work of the Group begins in January.\r\nMr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): First of all, I should like to express my\r\ndelegation’s gratitude to the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group, Ambassador Wilhelm Breitenstein of\r\nFinland and Ambassador Nitya Pibulsonggram of\r\nThailand, for their steadfast efforts in presiding jointly\r\nover the work of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council.\r\nDuring the past year, the Working Group has\r\ncovered considerable ground. It held a large number of\r\nmeetings, and its intensive work produced a large number\r\nof contributions and proposals from Member States. One\r\ncannot but welcome the submission for the first time of\r\na wide-ranging and substantive report from the Working\r\nGroup, together with a compendium of the documents\r\nused and the views and proposals submitted. The Working\r\nGroup now has solid and varied documentation enabling\r\nit to continue its work during the current session, a\r\nsession that marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization. The publication of the report also means\r\nthat academicians and the public now have documentation\r\nenabling them to keep abreast of this important question\r\nand to offer their ideas, thereby enriching the debate on\r\nexpanding the Security Council.\r\nIt is clear, in the light of the documentation\r\ncontained in the report, that the Working Group has made\r\ngreater progress on the issues of cluster II, which is to\r\nsay on matters not related to the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil, such as transparency in the work of the Council\r\nand improvements in its methods of work. In connection\r\nwith transparency and effectiveness, it must be noted that\r\nsince 1993, on the initiative of the members of the\r\nSecurity Council themselves, some progress has been\r\nmade in making it easier for all States Members of the\r\nOrganization to follow the work of the Council and, as\r\nappropriate, its consultations, through practical\r\narrangements that should be continually improved and\r\nbrought up to date. Since the gradual implementation of\r\nthese arrangements concerning transparency in the work\r\nof the Council, they have proved useful and beneficial,\r\nboth for members of the Council and for the other States\r\nMembers of the Organization. My delegation therefore\r\nbelieves that progress can and should continue to be made\r\non cluster II questions independently of developments in\r\nconnection with cluster I.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nHowever, the same cannot be said with regard to\r\ncluster I, whose main subject is the increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. Despite the great\r\nwealth of ideas, suggestions and even concrete formulas\r\nsubmitted in the past year, it must be admitted that\r\nprofound differences persist between members of the\r\nWorking Group. This should not be a source of\r\ndiscouragement; on the contrary, it should stir the Group to\r\nredouble its efforts to continue moving ahead in the search\r\nfor a consensus solution acceptable to all Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. On a subject that is so vitally important for\r\nthe future of the Organization, the search for consensus is\r\nessential.\r\nThere is consensus on the principle of expanding the\r\nCouncil, but not on its total membership or its composition.\r\nSpain favours a moderate increase in the number of\r\nmembers of the Council to a total of 21 to 25 members.\r\nThis would make it possible to improve the\r\nrepresentativeness of the Council by making it more\r\nbalanced and democratic, while at the same time\r\nmaintaining a composition consistent with the requirements\r\nof efficiency and speed in deliberation and decision-making.\r\nSpain believes the increase should incorporate a\r\nsystem providing for a more frequent presence in the\r\nCouncil of States with weight and influence in international\r\nrelations and with the ability and desire to make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and to the other purposes of the United\r\nNations, in accordance with Article 23 of the Charter. In\r\nthis connection, special reference should be made, inter\r\nalia, to Member States’ contributions of troops and other\r\npersonnel to peace-keeping operations.\r\nThis would not mean creating a new category of\r\nmembers of the Security Council, since the States enjoying\r\na more frequent presence would periodically be subject to\r\nelection by the General Assembly, as are the other non-\r\npermanent members of the Council, so that the democratic\r\nlegitimacy of such members of the Council would always\r\nbe duly guaranteed.\r\nAny expansion of the Security Council will inevitably\r\nmean a change in the majority required for decision-\r\nmaking. On the basis of the provisions of Article 27 of the\r\nCharter, a distinction in this respect could be drawn\r\nbetween three types of decisions: first, decisions on\r\nprocedural matters; secondly, decisions relating to\r\nsubstantive issues outside the framework of Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, which are essentially questions relating to the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes; and, finally, decisions\r\nwithin the framework of Chapter VII, which entail\r\nrecourse to coercive measures.\r\nDecisions in each of these categories would require\r\na different majority: the more important the decision to be\r\ntaken, the greater the required majority. Thus, the so-\r\ncalled right of veto of the permanent members would be\r\napplicable only in the third category of decisions, those\r\nadopted within the framework of Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMy delegation believes that the Working Group\r\nshould continue its deliberations during this fiftieth\r\nsession and, on the basis of the report, the annexed\r\ncompendium and the views expressed during this debate\r\nin the General Assembly, begin its substantive work at the\r\nbeginning of 1996.\r\nI wish to offer assurances once again that the\r\nSpanish delegation will continue to participate actively in\r\nthe work of the Working Group and will provide the\r\nChairman with the necessary cooperation so that we can\r\nadvance towards a consensus in our efforts to reach\r\nconclusions that are generally acceptable to Member\r\nStates.\r\nMs. Wilmshurst (United Kingdom): We have been\r\ndiscussing the issue of Security Council enlargement in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group for two years now. The\r\npositions of delegations are well known. The United\r\nKingdom delegation has set out its position in some detail\r\nin the Open-ended Working Group. Suffice it for me to\r\nsay today that we believe that the Council should be\r\nenlarged and that this enlargement should be carried out\r\nin a way that enhances its effectiveness. On the issue of\r\nadditional permanent members, it is our very strongly\r\nheld view, as the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary\r\nboth made clear earlier in this session, that there are\r\ncertain countries which, by virtue of their global interests\r\nand their contribution to international peace, should be\r\ninvited to accept the rights and responsibilities of\r\npermanent membership. We therefore support German\r\nand Japanese permanent membership, for which we\r\nbelieve the case is entirely convincing. We are also\r\nstrongly of the view that there need to be additional seats\r\nfor Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean in\r\nan enlarged Council. We remain open-minded as to the\r\nnature of those additional seats.\r\nAs for the cluster II issues of transparency and other\r\nmatters related to the Security Council, we welcome and\r\nhave encouraged the steps taken by the Security Council\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nto improve its working methods over the last year — in\r\nparticular the inauguration of regular briefings by the\r\nPresidency of non-members on the work of the Council, the\r\ngreater openness in the work of the Sanctions Committees\r\nand the consolidation of a stronger process of consultation\r\nwith troop contributors. Some of those steps are derived\r\nfrom ideas raised in the Working Group as well as in the\r\nGeneral Assembly more widely. That process of organic\r\nevolutionary change should continue. So too, for the\r\nmoment, should consideration of those issues in the Open-\r\nended Working Group.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group made some useful\r\nprogress during the course of the forty-ninth session and for\r\nthat we pay tribute to the President of that session, the\r\nForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, and to the great industry\r\nand perseverance of the representatives of Thailand and\r\nFinland, the Co-Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group.\r\nTheir observations and assessment were particularly useful\r\nand should provide an important guide for our work in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group when it resumes, which we\r\nhope it will do very soon.\r\nThe issues are now clear. The discussion on the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council has gone on for a long\r\ntime. We need to make a real effort at this session, under\r\nthe guidance of the President, to move from discussion to\r\nnegotiation, and from debate to decisions, in the interest not\r\njust of the Security Council but of the reform of the\r\nOrganization more generally.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): The maintenance of international\r\npeace and security remains the major task of this\r\nOrganization. Changes in the international milieu, now\r\ninspired by a wider cooperation, have enabled and\r\nfacilitated the discussion on the future character of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council has provided, and\r\nproved itself to be, a worthy forum for a broad-ranging\r\nexchange of opinions with the ultimate aim of attaining a\r\nconvergence of views on these important topics. Much has\r\nbeen discussed. Some very important aspects have been\r\nagreed upon. Other key and essential elements still require\r\nfurther discussion.\r\nI join other speakers in thanking the representatives of\r\nFinland and Thailand for the sterling work they did last\r\nyear.\r\nCommenting on the Open-ended Working Group’s\r\nachievements in their observations and assessment\r\ncontained in the annex to the report on the Working\r\nGroup, the Vice-Chairmen state that in their judgement\r\n“important progress has been achieved during the\r\npast two sessions and the groundwork necessary for\r\nthe reform of the Security Council has been laid”.\r\nHowever, they also note the importance of recognizing\r\nthat\r\n“much remains to be done before a comprehensive\r\nagreement can be reached among all Member\r\nStates”.\r\nThey advise that:\r\n“In order to arrive at such an agreement the\r\nmomentum of the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup must be maintained.” (A/49/965, annex, p. 16)\r\nThe great number of delegations that have asked to\r\nspeak during this session is indicative of the will of\r\nMember States to retain this momentum. Consensus has\r\nalready been reached on the basic premise inspiring\r\nreform, namely, that the Security Council needs to be\r\nmore representative in nature and reflect better the\r\nmembership of the Organization in a changed\r\ninternational system.\r\nThe Vice-Chairmen stress in their report that\r\n“Without serious effort to retain this\r\nmomentum, the status quo would prevail.”\r\nThey also acknowledge, however, that\r\n“several delegations do not wish to set any\r\nartificial deadlines for the conclusion of the\r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group.”\r\n(ibid.)\r\nThe crux of the matter remains that of how best to\r\ntranslate the existing consensus on reform into a\r\ncomprehensive and long-lasting conclusion emerging from\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. Various options have\r\nbeen discussed and proposed by Member States. These\r\nrange from a number of proposals which offer different\r\ncomputations for an increase in the membership of\r\nexisting categories to those which involve understandings,\r\nwhich take into account the possibility of having some\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nMember States more frequently but not permanently serving\r\non the Council, as in the case of the proposals tabled by\r\nItaly and Mexico. Each merits attention and careful\r\nconsideration.\r\nSuch reflection by the general membership should not\r\nbe construed or interpreted as being a mere repetition of\r\npast work and discussion. Whilst it is true that the next\r\nphase of work is the process of actual negotiation, are we\r\nsufficiently convinced that there exists enough of a broad-\r\nbased consensus to take us into this phase? Are we agreed\r\non all the relevant principles as yet?\r\nMy delegation’s impression is that at present we have\r\nnot reached that stage. That is especially true of the\r\ndiscussions on the question of the future categories of\r\nmembership of the Security Council. Deliberations on that\r\nquestion are especially delicate. Proposals on different and\r\nnew categories remain interesting to my delegation.\r\nThe ultimate decision on the future character and\r\ncomposition of the Security Council must seek to reflect the\r\nreality of an expanded and enlarged General Assembly. The\r\npath that is finally adopted should aim at enhancing, rather\r\nthan diminishing, the existing possibilities of rotation\r\namongst the broadest possible number of Members. It is for\r\nthis reason that this delegation views with great concern the\r\nproposal to lift the restriction on the immediate re-election\r\nof Security Council members.\r\nThe question of the increase in Security Council\r\nmembership should not detract our attention from other\r\nequally important issues that relate to its present functioning\r\nand to the Council’s interaction with the rest of the\r\nmembership. This Organization has been committed to a\r\nprocess of revitalization of its major organs, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The General Assembly is the only organ\r\nin which all Member States are permanent members.\r\nAs recently stated during the Commemorative Meeting\r\nfor the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations by my\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nMr. Guido de Marco,\r\n“We believe, and have always maintained, that\r\nthere has to be a revitalization of the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. ... In the restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council, a symbiotic relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly is of the essence.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 40th meeting, p. 56)\r\nOnly through the building of a more responsive and\r\nimmediate relationship between the Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council can we enhance the contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations universal membership to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMuch has already been achieved in rendering the\r\nwork of the Security Council more transparent. Malta\r\nwelcomes the practices instituted thus far. These are steps\r\nin a worthy direction and examples of the will and\r\ncommitment to transparency. Practices that go in the\r\ndirection of greater participation facilitate the work of the\r\nCouncil and the Assembly in ensuring the effectiveness of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe Working Group’s efforts thus far trace one of\r\nthe multiple paths of reflection being taken by Member\r\nStates on the future of the Organization. The fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations has provided us with an\r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to the principles of\r\nthe Charter. We should indeed take full advantage of the\r\nmomentum offered by this anniversary and aim for\r\nsubstantial achievements during this session. But such an\r\nintent should be encouraging rather than restrictive. It is\r\nmore of a target and less of a plan. Undue insistence on\r\na rigid time-table can take us off on a tangent and away\r\nfrom that open discussion which has imprinted the work\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group thus far.\r\nOur central commitment is to identify a fair and\r\nlong-lasting reform, a reform that does not detract from\r\nthe Security Council’s present ability and responsibility to\r\nperform its duties in accordance with the principles\r\nestablished by the Charter. To that commitment, this\r\ndelegation pledges its full support.\r\nMr. Thanarajasingam (Malaysia): At the outset, we\r\nwish to acknowledge with appreciation the tireless efforts\r\nof the Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council, Mr. Amara Essy, and\r\nhis two Vice-Chairmen, the Permanent Representatives of\r\nFinland and Thailand. The work within this Group has\r\nnever been easy, given the importance and complexity of\r\nthe issues involved. The Group has yet to find the right\r\nrecipe, the right balance between the impulses of\r\ndemocracy and power politics, as we remain collectively\r\nengaged in promoting international peace, security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe question relating to the Security Council has\r\nbeen the subject of intensive debates in this body as well\r\nas outside for years. Since the establishment of the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nWorking Group two years ago, the global momentum to\r\nmake the Security Council representative and to improve its\r\nworking and decision-making methods has intensified. After\r\ntwo years of meetings, there is consensus to enlarge the\r\nmembership, a point reflected in the report of this Group.\r\nBut enlargement or expansion, however great or small, will\r\nnot by itself resolve the multifaceted problems confronting\r\nthe Security Council. The Council must be comprehensively\r\nrestructured and reformed if it is to discharge its Charter-\r\nmandated function.\r\nCommenting on the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, the Malaysian Prime Minister, in his address in the\r\ngeneral debate on 29 September 1995, stated, as on other\r\noccasions:\r\n“permanent seats should be given to regions, possibly\r\ndetermined by a regional mechanism”. (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 12th meeting, p. 4)\r\nMalaysia maintains that permanent seats should be given to\r\nregions, and not on the basis of specific countries. Given\r\nthe increasingly important role of regionalism and\r\nsubregionalism within the context of globalism, the\r\ncomposition of a global institution should reflect this\r\nimportant development. The interests of the region, not the\r\ninterests of individual countries, must be the basis, a\r\nconcept already embraced by one of the largest regional\r\ngroups within the United Nations.\r\nFifty years after the birth of this Organization, we\r\nmust take steps, if not strides, to veer away from practices\r\nthat entrench power politics. We need to move towards\r\nmore representative forms that truly seek to reflect the\r\ncollective interests of all. Only in this context can there be\r\nenduring interests, determined — within the dynamics of\r\nthe area — by regional and subregional partners. The\r\nmechanism, however, would have to be worked out in\r\ndetail by the respective regions. My delegation looks\r\nforward to sharing thoughts on this issue as and when the\r\nWorking Group reconvenes.\r\nAs to the size of the increase, there is no monopoly of\r\nwisdom or knowledge over the magic figure. At the end of\r\nthe day, it is essentially a political decision that must take\r\non board the concerns of all of us, especially those that are\r\nalready disadvantaged, particularly the developing countries.\r\nThe Council cannot remain nor become the permanent\r\nmultilateral abode solely of the rich and powerful.\r\nThe question of veto is one of the cardinal issues, as\r\nit impinges directly on the decision-making process of the\r\nCouncil. Malaysia has consistently spoken out against the\r\nveto power. In his address of 29 September 1995, the\r\nMalaysian Prime Minister reaffirmed this position, saying:\r\n“The veto power should be dropped. Under no\r\ncircumstances must the Security Council be made an\r\ninstrument of any one country.” (ibid)\r\nThe veto power negates the principle of sovereign\r\nequality, and is anachronistic. While its explicit exercise\r\nhas declined since the end of the cold war, the threat of\r\nits use has often been exploited to prevent the Council\r\nfrom fulfilling its Charter mandate. There would seem to\r\nbe a correlation between its non-use and the increasing\r\nnumber of informal meetings, often involving select\r\nMember States, where decisions are often made.\r\nAt the same time, it is evident that those with the\r\nveto power would not give their assent to its abolition.\r\nNotwithstanding this position, the international community\r\nmust be relentless in this struggle. We fully support the\r\nproposal to define Article 27 of the Charter, which in its\r\ncurrent state is ambiguous. Article 27 makes a distinction\r\nas to voting procedure between procedural and substantive\r\nquestions, without, however, defining these terms.\r\nAccording to Goodrich and Hambro, the authors of a\r\nbook, published in 1949,\r\n“No article of the Charter has in practice aroused\r\ngreater controversy than Article 27.” (Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations — Commentary and Documents,\r\np. 220)\r\nBased on General Assembly resolution 267 (III),\r\nadopted in 1949, we believe that the time has come for a\r\nserious and in-depth examination of the application of\r\nArticle 27.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation endorses the following\r\nspecific proposals: firstly, to establish general criteria for\r\nthe identification of what are to be considered actions of\r\na procedural nature, as stated in Article 27 (2) of the\r\nCharter; secondly, to identify the questions of “vital\r\nimportance”, as stated in resolution 267 (III), where the\r\nveto could be applied; and, thirdly, to establish a\r\nmechanism that would modify the present voting system,\r\nincluding ensuring that a single vote would not be\r\nsufficient to prohibit the overwhelming majority within\r\nthe Council from making a pronouncement or taking a\r\ndecision.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nWhile recognizing the difficulties, we believe that the\r\napplication of the veto could be modified by procedures and\r\nunderstandings that could be developed in the course of our\r\nnext stage of discussions in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. We hope that the permanent members will be\r\nforthcoming and not adopt a dogmatic approach if\r\nsubstantive progress in all aspects is to be made.\r\nMy delegation fully subscribes to the position of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, as reflected in its position paper\r\ncontained in document A/49/965. The paper addresses both\r\nissues of expansion and working methods. In response to\r\nthe universal clamour, including that of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, to improve its working methods, the Council\r\nhas introduced some measures. Yet these measures are yet\r\nto be institutionalized. We believe that other measures, as\r\nsuggested by the Non-Aligned Movement, need to be\r\nadopted by the Security Council to improve transparency.\r\nOne specific area requiring immediate attention\r\npertains to consultations between the Security Council and\r\nthe troop-contributing countries. Although the presidential\r\nstatement in the Security Council on 4 November 1994 has\r\nfacilitated some degree of consultation, the process remains\r\nad hoc. The co-chairmanship of the meetings by the\r\nPresident of the Security Council and the Secretariat has\r\nbeen ineffective. It is time for the implementation of Article\r\n44 of the Charter, which invites the Member State\r\nconcerned\r\n“to participate in the decisions of the Security Council\r\nconcerning the employment of contingents of that\r\nMember’s armed forces”.\r\nWe wish to underline our disappointment that non-\r\ngovernmental organizations have been prevented from being\r\ninvolved in this Working Group — ironically, often by\r\nsome of the very delegations which have advocated their\r\ninvolvement in other Working Groups of the General\r\nAssembly. The Working Group can benefit from their\r\ninputs, and we hope that during the present chairmanship\r\nthis issue can be resolved.\r\nThe credibility and effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity depend on the success of this reform exercise. In\r\nsupporting the Security Council, we must correct its current\r\nweaknesses and imbalances. A reformed and restructured\r\nSecurity Council must reflect the realities of our times.\r\nMr. Laing (Belize): The delegation of Belize fully\r\nsubscribes to the statement which will be made shortly by\r\nthe delegation of Guyana on behalf of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, but which, unfortunately, could not be made\r\nearlier.\r\nSince this most recent phase of the debate on the\r\nreform of the Security Council began some two years\r\nago, speakers have often focused on the differences\r\nbetween us, sometimes almost with a sense of despair.\r\nHowever, on perusing the recent report of the Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Open-ended Working Group seized of\r\nthis subject, it is remarkable that a substantial measure of\r\nagreement has been reached on a number of topics. This\r\nconsensus has, in no small measure, been due to the\r\ndiligent efforts of the Vice-Chairmen, under the guidance\r\nand inspiration of the President’s distinguished\r\npredecessors, Mr. Samuel Insanally and Mr. Amara Essy.\r\nWe can therefore reflect with satisfaction on the large\r\nmeasure of agreement on the issues relating to the\r\nquestion of the working methods of the Council,\r\nparticularly the formerly sore topic of transparency. I\r\nwould suggest that these advances have been quite\r\nremarkable.\r\nIt is patently clear to this delegation that there is\r\nagreement that the Council has to be democratized. In\r\nfact, this delegation has not once heard any defence of the\r\ncontrary proposition during the numerous interventions in\r\nthis Assembly’s general debate, during the Assembly’s\r\nprevious debates on this agenda item, during the meetings\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group, or during the recent\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting. This might appear to\r\nbe a victory without substance. But, to understand its\r\nsignificance, we must take into consideration the\r\ntremendous growth in the Organization’s jurisprudence on\r\nthe principle of democratization. Over recent years, under\r\nthe impulsion of our collective efforts, the most\r\nundemocratic Governments have accepted, without major\r\ndemur, the obligation to accord the rights and freedoms\r\nof democracy to their peoples. There has been a flowering\r\nof elections throughout the planet, all under the banner of\r\ndemocracy. In many places, the United Nations has\r\noverseen the transition to democracy, a topic which we\r\nnow formally debate during this Assembly’s sessions, as\r\nwe did this morning. A people’s right to the free exercise\r\nof democracy has possibly now become enshrined as a\r\ncrucial norm of international law. How could it be\r\notherwise? Democracy is an aspect of the extraordinary\r\nedifice of human rights and freedoms which we have so\r\ndiligently constructed since the Atlantic Charter.\r\nSince no State has challenged the vitality of the\r\ndoctrine of democracy during this thoroughgoing exercise,\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nit appears to this delegation that there exists agreement on\r\na number of matters. Firstly, we believe that there is broad\r\nagreement on reform of the veto, the quintessence of anti-\r\npopularism. Other evidence for this conclusion is the\r\nsilence of a number of major Powers which might\r\notherwise have claimed that this was a reserved domain.\r\nWith the widespread chorus favouring change, we conclude\r\nthat there is agreement that the veto will be reformed.\r\nReform will probably take either the form of the\r\nspecification of particular cases in which the right may be\r\nexercised or the requirement of the concurrence, in any\r\nputative exercise, of a minimum number of States.\r\nIf we are incorrect, we would request those who have\r\ndifferent views to let their views be heard. If we are\r\ncorrect, we would agree that the full application of this\r\nunderstanding might await agreement on a package on a\r\nnumber of other issues. Of course, this delegation must\r\nacknowledge that those States which now possess the veto\r\nmight be temporarily exempt from such reform.\r\nThere have been many rich contributions to the\r\ndiscussion of the structure of the Security Council. Again,\r\nbroad agreement can be detected. This delegation believes\r\nthat there is an overall sense that all five regions of this\r\nOrganization should be equitably and democratically\r\nrepresented in the permanent membership band of the\r\nCouncil. The differences lie in such details as the number\r\nof such members, the methods of their selection and their\r\ntenure.\r\nHowever, if on resumption of the deliberations of the\r\nWorking Group the President of the General Assembly\r\nwere to identify consensus on this broad principle, further\r\nprogress might be facilitated. Of course, my delegation\r\nmaintains that there must be equity, and that all regions\r\ndeserve equal representation — two members for each\r\nregion, which would include four of the existing permanent\r\nmembers. Again, we might have to live with the existing\r\npermanent members’ continuing to serve and exercise their\r\nprivileges — temporarily, I should hope.\r\nWe have heard a number of delegations recommend\r\nthat certain, named States should be specially designated\r\npermanent members. However, my delegation holds the\r\nview that the approach of naming States is incompatible\r\nwith the overarching premise of democracy. Besides, we\r\nare all well aware of the phenomenon of the dissolution of\r\nStates and of the difficult questions of State succession to\r\nwhich this gives rise. In very recent years, this question has\r\nhad to be addressed in relation even to a permanent\r\nmember of the Council. It would be folly to take risks now.\r\nOn the other hand, it is clear that there is agreement\r\non a number of the factors that undoubtedly inform the\r\nrecommendation that particular States, including one of\r\nthe existing permanent members, should be so specially\r\ndesignated. These factors surely include the following:\r\nfirst, willingness to contribute very significantly to peace\r\nand security; secondly, the constitutional and physical\r\nability to contribute to peace and security; and, thirdly,\r\npossession of the financial means so to contribute, as\r\nevidenced by minimum United Nations budgetary\r\nassessments.\r\nLet us, then, enact these or similar or other criteria,\r\nrather than discuss named States. It might well be that, on\r\nthe basis of such criteria, two or three States, including an\r\nexisting permanent member, would qualify for specially\r\ndesignated permanent membership, over and above the 10\r\nregional permanent members that we propose.\r\nOne egregiously undemocratic aspect of this entire\r\nquestion is the fact that the vast majority of States have\r\nnever served on the Security Council. At present there is\r\na tendency for the Council to be serviced by delegations\r\nsufficiently large to enable them to participate in its\r\nnumerous committees — and frequent world travel is\r\ninvolved. It is clear that, without some novel solutions,\r\nthis trend will continue.\r\nMy delegation again suggests that States be given\r\nthe option — I repeat: the option — of applying to the\r\nregular membership of the Council the modality of\r\nsharing a seat on a subregional and neighbourhood or\r\nadjacency basis, in the same manner as is currently done\r\nin the Global Environment Facility and other financial\r\ninstitutions.\r\nSince 1945, when, for the second or third time this\r\ncentury, the unilateral use of force was outlawed, we have\r\nbeen willing participants in a system of collectives —\r\nincluding regional — security. In such a system, security\r\nis a shared endeavour. It could not be otherwise. The\r\nbasis for sharing a seat is therefore even more sound in\r\nthe case of the Council than in the case of financial\r\ninstitutions.\r\nLet me be clear: if we were to do nothing but ensure\r\nmore adequate participation by the vast majority of\r\nunrepresented States, while removing aspects of inequity\r\nand lack of democracy, much would be accomplished,\r\nand my delegation would be reasonably satisfied. Under\r\nthe President’s wise leadership, we have high hopes for\r\na happy and successful conclusion to these deliberations\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nduring this momentous fiftieth anniversary year. I wish you\r\ngood luck.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe statement of the Permanent Representative of\r\nColombia, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, was\r\nfaithful to the deliberations and conclusions of the\r\nMovement’s eleventh summit conference, which was held\r\nin Cartagena last October, and it enjoys my delegation’s\r\nfull support.\r\nThat statement referred in particular to the need to\r\ndemocratize the United Nations to reflect the universal\r\nnature of the Organization and to implement the principle\r\nof the sovereign equality of States. It also emphasized the\r\nrequirements of representativeness and transparency in the\r\nSecurity Council. Similarly, it reaffirmed the overall\r\nproposal submitted to the Working Group by the non-\r\naligned countries and the position of principle that it is\r\nessential that there be a substantial increase in the\r\nproportion of Council members belonging to the Movement.\r\nFinally, the Heads of State or Government of the non-\r\naligned countries very appropriately reiterated the position\r\ntaken by the Movement at its fifth, sixth and tenth summits\r\non the question of the right of veto, which is that they\r\nsupport a reduction in the field of application of the veto,\r\nas a step towards its abolition, and ended by mentioning the\r\nGeneral Conference to review the United Nations Charter\r\nforeseen in Article 109 of the Charter.\r\nThis contribution of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nwhich was made after completion of the Working Group’s\r\nreport now before us, is particularly important in that it is\r\nsufficient in itself to open up, in a serious and responsible\r\nmanner, the whole problem of a Security Council reform\r\nthat would respond genuinely to the expectations of the\r\ngreat majority of States Members of the United Nations and\r\nenjoy their full support. From that point of view, the\r\nposition expressed at Cartagena has a clarifying effect that\r\nis especially beneficial for the future activities of the\r\nWorking Group.\r\nThanks to the solid and laborious discussions that we\r\nhave had throughout the past year in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil, we are today beginning our debate on this item\r\nbetter informed as to the political obstacles accentuated by\r\nmethodological failings, that prevent us from making a\r\nsignificant breakthrough.\r\nBut, whatever one may think of our discussions on\r\nthis question at the forty-ninth session, we must recognize\r\nthat the work of the Working Group has now entered a\r\ncrucial and qualitatively new phase. This development is\r\nboth promising and fortunate for the credibility and\r\neffectiveness of the Working Group as a framework for\r\ndemocratic debate within the United Nations and as an\r\nexpression of the General Assembly’s exercise of its\r\nlegislative and political functions.\r\nThus, my delegation, whose positions on all the\r\naspects of this important question have been set forth\r\nclearly and in detail, will focus its thinking on the\r\naspects — particularly the methodological aspects —\r\nwhich we regard as the determining ones as the Working\r\nGroup prepares to enter into discussions at the beginning\r\nof next year. That we hope will be decisive for its future\r\nand for the success of our efforts.\r\nThe Working Group has unquestionably played a\r\ncatalytic role in an all-inclusive debate which contributed\r\nto the maturation of ideas and the emergence of a\r\nmotivating force for the distillation of concrete proposals,\r\nwhose wealth and diversity are demonstrated in the\r\ncompendium published as a working document. But the\r\nrather widespread expression of a sincere desire to make\r\nthe Security Council more effective, more transparent,\r\nmore legitimate and more democratic are coming up\r\nagainst the fact that this exercise brings together States\r\nwhich are pursuing contradictory — perhaps even\r\nirreconcilable — goals.\r\nIn addition, there are the legal and institutional limits\r\nimposed by the Charter of the United Nations itself.\r\nThere are also the problems stemming from the\r\nincomplete nature of some proposals. In fact, only the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement has presented proposals based on\r\na comprehensive approach. Therefore, there is a need for\r\na new modus operandi which would channel efforts to\r\nachieve what is possible because it is acceptable to the\r\nlargest number — rather than continuing to explore ways\r\nwhich inevitably lead to deadlock.\r\nWith regard to such a new modus operandi, what is\r\nrequired more than ever is transparency in the conduct of\r\ndebates, promotion of a comprehensive approach to the\r\nquestion of reforming the Security Council, and a quest\r\nfor consensus in the drafting and formulation of\r\narrangements agreed upon. I wish to specify, with regard\r\nto transparency, that my delegation has repeatedly\r\nsuggested keeping the public in our countries regularly\r\nand objectively informed of the progress of our debates,\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nso that the complexity of this exercise will be very clear\r\nand no hasty conclusions will be encouraged or drawn.\r\nTo be dynamic, the Working Group must also\r\nestablish a relationship of total trust between the members\r\nof the Bureau and the Member States. The Bureau must\r\nfeel encouraged to fully play its role of reducing differences\r\nin viewpoints, in a spirit of complete impartiality. I am\r\npleased, in this context, to pay tribute to President Amara\r\nEssy and to our colleagues from Thailand and Finland for\r\nthe efforts they have made to that end.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations has prompted a quest to restore the\r\nOrganization to the peoples in whose name the Charter has\r\nset forth values, purposes and principles which we must try\r\nto promote more than in the past. The frustrations in public\r\nopinion are most often linked to impairments in the\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council. Therefore, our common\r\nefforts must move resolutely towards a reform which would\r\njustify the position of those who believe that the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council goes hand in hand\r\nwith democratization and legitimacy.\r\nThe major challenge today is to build a new system of\r\ninternational relations which is anchored in the original\r\npurity of the values, purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, and which should be protected from the\r\nreflexes, practices and references of the cold war. The\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil will do useful work only if all the participants in\r\nit are determined to base their undertaking on this historical\r\nperspective.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): The challenge for the\r\nSecurity Council today, after the emergence of a new,\r\ncooperative spirit in international relations, is to become\r\nfully adjusted to the function the founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations expected it to fulfil: to bear the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. This is also a challenge for all of us while we\r\nagain discuss Security Council reform. Increased activities\r\nand a broadened spectrum of position-taking and decision-\r\nmaking on behalf of the whole membership underline the\r\nimportance of the overall legitimacy of the Security Council\r\nas the highest political body on the international scene.\r\nIn the view of a large majority of Member States, the\r\ncurrent structure of the Council does not, however, take\r\ninto account international changes which have occurred\r\nduring the last decades, due, inter alia, to the process of\r\ndecolonization and to political and economic\r\ndevelopments and realignments. In their opinion, the\r\nSecurity Council, bearing the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, does\r\nnot adequately reflect the universality of its mandators,\r\nthat is, the general membership of the Organization.\r\nAustria shares this preoccupation.\r\nThe Security Council’s authority must be strong\r\nenough to generate the political will of the broad range of\r\nthe whole membership of the Organization to carry out its\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe task of maintaining and strengthening this\r\nlegitimacy of the Security Council, and guaranteeing it by\r\na high degree of representativity and by adequate\r\ntransparency, constitutes the essential challenge for the\r\nSecurity Council in the future. And we, the Member\r\nStates represented in the General Assembly, must build\r\nthe necessary foundations. We must agree on necessary\r\nstructural changes to enable the Security Council to live\r\nup to this challenge.\r\nIn this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, we must combine our efforts to ensure that this\r\nOrganization is well-equipped for the next half century.\r\nA reformed Security Council which can rely on universal\r\nsupport will be of vital importance in the decades to\r\ncome.\r\nSince our debate last year, the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council,\r\nwhich was established by the forty-eighth General\r\nAssembly, has had a dynamic and rich discussion on all\r\nissues pertaining to its mandate. In this context, I would\r\nlike to pay a special tribute to Ambassadors Wilhelm\r\nBreitenstein from Finland and Nitya Pibulsonggram from\r\nThailand for the untiring efforts they have undertaken in\r\ntheir capacity as Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group.\r\nMy delegation, like many others, is most grateful for the\r\nexcellent compendium of observations and assessment\r\nthey have jointly prepared in document A/49/965, which\r\nprovides a most detailed insight into the progress made\r\nduring the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nDuring this year’s general debate and, most recently,\r\non the occasion of the Special Commemorative Meeting\r\non the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, a significant number of heads of delegation again\r\nunderlined the urgent need for substantive progress in our\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nwork, which should finally culminate in the taking of a\r\npolitical decision on an appropriate reform of the Council.\r\nWe should take advantage of this high level of interest in\r\nthe subject and the present dynamism. Aiming first at a\r\nmore focused debate, we should enter as soon as possible\r\nthe process of negotiations.\r\nThe Austrian delegation, together with a number of\r\nother countries, elaborated a discussion paper that was\r\nsubmitted to the Working Group during the forty-ninth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Our aim in preparing that\r\npaper was to make a constructive contribution to the debate\r\nand to highlight possible compromise solutions. The focal\r\npoints of the Austrian position, reached after in-depth\r\nconsideration of the numerous other proposals and\r\nsuggestions presented during the Working Group’s\r\ndeliberations, which are also contained in that document,\r\ncan be summarized as follows.\r\nFirst, in our view, the main objective of the reform\r\nmust be to guarantee a high degree of representativity in\r\nthe Council and the efficiency and effectiveness of its work.\r\nWith this in mind, its future enlargement — which, in any\r\ncase, should not exceed a total of 25 members — has to\r\ntake full account of the reality and pluralism of today’s\r\nworld and satisfy the need for equitable geographic\r\nrepresentation.\r\nSecondly, during the last 50 years the concept of\r\nhaving both permanent and non-permanent members has\r\nproved its merits. The necessary continuity of the Council’s\r\nwork and the appropriate reflection of the international\r\npower structure were combined with democratic elements,\r\nthus ensuring a certain degree of representativity and\r\nproviding fresh ideas for the solution of upcoming\r\nproblems. In our view, on the basis of this experience, any\r\nfuture enlargement should take place within the existing\r\ncategories by preserving as much as possible the present\r\nconfiguration of balance between permanent and non-\r\npermanent seats.\r\nThirdly, the general criteria for the choice of new\r\npermanent members must be political and economic\r\nrealities, the global influence of the potential candidates and\r\ntheir capacity and willingness to contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, including\r\nthrough contributions to peace-keeping operations. The\r\nprinciple of equitable geographic representation has to\r\napply.\r\nFourthly, for the election of non-permanent\r\nmembers — based, again, on the principle of geographic\r\nrepresentation — the current criteria listed in Article 23,\r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter should be maintained.\r\nFifthly, as the deliberations within the Working\r\nGroup clearly demonstrated, one of the main concerns of\r\ndelegations is the future voting procedure in the Council,\r\nin particular the question of the veto. Austria, along with\r\na significant number of other countries, is of the view that\r\nthe veto should and could be limited in its scope and use.\r\nThe legitimacy of the Security Council not only calls\r\nfor a higher degree of formalized representativity, but also\r\nfor increased interaction between the members and non-\r\nmembers of the Council. In our view, it is of the greatest\r\nimportance that the universal membership be able to\r\nunderstand how political situations are dealt with by the\r\nCouncil. An adequate flow of information towards non-\r\nmembers is extremely helpful in this context and should\r\ntherefore be continuously facilitated. Certainly, in order to\r\nensure constructive discussions and negotiations,\r\ndeliberations in closed meetings will remain necessary.\r\nHowever, a certain balance between privacy and\r\ntransparency has to be established in order to pave the\r\nway for possible feedback on the work of the Council\r\nfrom the international community, as represented in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Delegations with a special interest in\r\nparticular political situations dealt with in the Security\r\nCouncil should, at an early stage of the decision-making\r\nprocess, have the opportunity to offer their views and\r\nprovide input. This applies in particular to countries\r\nwhich are politically concerned by a given conflict or\r\nwhich will be economically affected by a future or\r\npresent sanctions regime, because of, for example, their\r\ngeographic proximity.\r\nA better exchange of views and information will\r\nhelp increase the confidence of non-members in the\r\nCouncil’s work, its credibility and its political authority.\r\nIn this context, my delegation wholeheartedly\r\nwelcomes the significant improvements made by the\r\nCouncil in the last year or so towards better access to\r\ninformation, and we ask all its present and future\r\nmembers to assure an appropriate and consistent follow-\r\nup to these initial steps.\r\nSince the discussions on the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council meet with well-known difficulties, we\r\nare of the opinion that in order to enhance legitimacy of\r\nthe Council, the immediate need is for greater attention to\r\nbe given to the cluster II, as contained in the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\ncompendium, with a view to strengthening the transparency\r\nand the working methods of the Council.\r\nWith its long-standing tradition in the area of United\r\nNations peace-keeping, Austria attaches the greatest\r\nimportance to a prompt and continued flow of information\r\nin this context. My delegation would therefore like to\r\nemphasize the progress that has already been achieved in\r\nthis area.\r\nThe recent improvements are a result of the proposals\r\nand debates held in the framework of the General\r\nAssembly’s Working Group. We await with great interest\r\nits forthcoming meetings, which will, hopefully, provide\r\nmore ideas on how the working methods of a reformed\r\nCouncil can be further improved. Although some\r\ndelegations might not wish to set so-called artificial\r\ndeadlines, let me reiterate that we fully share the Vice-\r\nChairmen’s views, expressed in their compendium, that\r\nMember States should take full advantage of the\r\nmomentum offered by the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations and aim for a substantial achievement in the debate\r\non the reform of the Council during this session.\r\nFor this to happen, I submit that we will all have to\r\nput narrow national interests back into our files and try to\r\nfocus on the main goals, which I am sure we all share: how\r\nbest, in the interest of the international community as a\r\nwhole, to restructure the Security Council in order to\r\nenhance its representativity and legitimacy and at the same\r\ntime maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of its action.\r\nMr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nWe are beginning a third year of discussion on the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council. After the long months\r\nneeded to get negotiations under way, positions have\r\nrecently been stated. The time has come to enter a\r\nnegotiating phase that would make it possible for us to\r\nadvance towards the conclusion of this undertaking.\r\nWhat is most important at this stage is the clarity with\r\nwhich positions are presented. The approach advocated by\r\nFrance is well known and unambiguous and has been stated\r\nby the President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nFrench Republic on many occasions.\r\nFrance favours an increase in the number of members\r\nof the Security Council in the two existing categories, and\r\nwithout any changes in their attributions. In our view, this\r\nshould be accomplished through the inclusion of new\r\npartners as permanent members. Germany and Japan seem\r\nto us to be fully qualified to join that category, as are some\r\nStates of the South whose role on the international\r\npolitical scene deserves to be recognized and taken into\r\naccount. Some new non-permanent seats could also be\r\nestablished in order to improve the geographical\r\nrepresentativity of the Council, but this should be done in\r\nmoderation so as not to cast doubt upon the Council’s\r\nability to act effectively and quickly.\r\nAllow me to recall briefly the reasons why this\r\noption is in our view the one that would contribute most\r\neffectively to strengthening the Security Council while\r\npreserving the major checks and balances which have\r\nmarked the establishment, the life and the success of the\r\nOrganization for 50 years.\r\nThe San Francisco Charter — and the fiftieth\r\nanniversary Declaration — has just reminded us that it\r\ngives\r\n“... expression to the common values and aspirations\r\nof humankind” (resolution 50/6, para. 2) —\r\nconferred on a group of States the permanent seats in the\r\norgan with primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Some feel that this\r\norientation is a part of past history whose time is over\r\nand that since they cannot put an end to the privileges of\r\nthe permanent members, strengthening or expanding this\r\ncategory of members should be avoided. Those who hold\r\nthat view thus reject the very principles underlying the\r\nCharter. And it goes without saying that France does not\r\nshare this line of thinking.\r\nOn the contrary, it is our opinion that the concept\r\nwhich inspired the Charter has rendered inestimable\r\nservice to mankind and that it is important, for the future,\r\nto strengthen it while adapting it to the new\r\ncharacteristics of the international situation. The number\r\nof Member States has of course increased considerably,\r\nand that is why it is desirable that this greater diversity in\r\ninternational political life be reflected in a larger number\r\nof Council members. Moreover, the number of States that\r\nare playing a leading role in the world has also increased\r\nand their permanent presence in the Security Council is\r\ntherefore justified. Hence, we are firmly convinced that\r\nthe action of the Security Council, and consequently of\r\nthe United Nations, would be strengthened by recognizing\r\nthe role played today — side by side with China, France,\r\nthe Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the\r\nUnited States — by countries such as Germany and Japan\r\nas well as by other great countries belonging to the\r\ndeveloping world. This recognition would enable those\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nStates to contribute fully to international peace and security.\r\nIt would therefore contribute to the achievement of the\r\npurposes of the Charter.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to recall that\r\nthe Charter designates the permanent members to exercise\r\nglobal responsibilities on behalf of all the Members of the\r\nOrganization. There is no question of their drawing their\r\nlegitimacy from any regional mandate whatever. For that\r\nreason, in particular, the idea of “regional permanent seats”\r\nseems to us to lend itself to controversy. Indeed, we do not\r\nthink that the idea of semi-permanent members was broadly\r\nsupported within the Working Group. Moreover, we have\r\nreservations as to the idea that the choice of Council\r\nmembers should be removed from the General Assembly\r\nand left to the discretion of regional groups. In fact, this\r\nidea is not in keeping with the rule that States must be\r\naccountable to the entire Assembly for the way in which\r\nthey carry out their responsibilities.\r\nWe must think this matter through and determine\r\nwhich States would benefit from an expansion of the\r\nCouncil. We hope that the conclusion of this process of\r\nreflection will be that, without delay, we shall set ourselves\r\nthe goal of rallying the largest number of delegations\r\npossible around a viable formula prior to the start of the\r\nnext session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe know that the President intends to devote all his\r\nefforts to this project. We wish him to know that he has our\r\nfull support and our complete confidence. I take this\r\nopportunity also to express to the members of the Bureau\r\nof the Working Group, who have enabled us to make such\r\nsubstantial progress in our work, the very sincere gratitude\r\nof the French delegation. This gratitude is extended in the\r\nfirst place to Ambassador Breitenstein of Finland, who has\r\nbeen involved in this exercise from the very start, with\r\npraiseworthy devotion and impartiality on all points. Our\r\ngratitude goes also to Ambassador Chew Tai Soo of\r\nSingapore and then to his successor, Ambassador\r\nPibulsonggram of Thailand, who are as worthy of praise as\r\ntheir Co-Chairmen.\r\nI conclude by confirming that the French delegation\r\ndoes not claim any exclusivity in regard to the method to\r\nbe used and that it is prepared to participate in complete\r\ngood faith and in a constructive spirit in the negotiations\r\nwhich we are duty-bound to carry out successfully.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey): As my Foreign Minister stated\r\nin the general debate earlier in the session, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-\r\ncriticism, to revisit the Charter of the United Nations, to\r\nget back to basics, to adapt the United Nations to the new\r\npolitical environment and to make it the real centre of\r\ncollective security and global solidarity. In this context,\r\nand as my delegation has reiterated on numerous\r\noccasions, the focus of attention should be the Security\r\nCouncil, which carries the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe central issue before us is the enhancement of the\r\nrepresentative character of the Security Council. The new\r\ninternational political environment requires the\r\ndemocratization of the Council. When, on 28 June 1993,\r\nwe first presented our views on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, we referred to the following call by the\r\nSecretary-General that we recognize that:\r\n“the time has come to fulfil the logic of the Charter\r\nand pursue not only democratization within States,\r\nbut democratization throughout the international\r\nsystem ... it also means applying the principles of\r\ndemocratization within the United Nations itself, a\r\ngoal to which I am committed”. (A/48/264, p. 89)\r\nWe strongly endorse this call. Very recently, after almost\r\nthree years, the Secretary-General felt the need to re-\r\nemphasize it.\r\nThe widespread demands that the Security Council\r\nbe made more representative, democratic, responsive,\r\ntransparent and accountable should be met. We are\r\nstrongly in favour of genuine and comprehensive reform.\r\nIt is with these thoughts in mind that my delegation has\r\nactively participated in the first two years of deliberations\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council.\r\nHaving taken note of the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group contained in document A/49/47 and the\r\ncompendium contained in document A/49/965, we believe\r\nthat the next stage of deliberations should be held on the\r\nbasis of concrete proposals. There are now many useful\r\nideas and proposals before us which necessitate further\r\nreflection. But I must underline, once again, that we are\r\nagainst any unnecessary acceleration of the reform\r\nprocess.\r\nThere are two main aspects of our work which\r\nrequire equal attention: we have to enhance the\r\nrepresentative weight of the Council and to democratize\r\nits method of work.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nLet me dwell on the first point. The enhancement of\r\nthe representativity of the Council cannot be confined to a\r\nmere numerical expansion of its size. The modalities of the\r\nenlargement should also be elaborated. We do not believe\r\nthat an increase in the overall number of seats will alone\r\nsuffice to ensure more equitable and representative\r\nparticipation in the work of the Council. The enlargement\r\nshould be coupled with a fair system of workable rotation.\r\nIn this context, we firmly believe that the proposal\r\nsubmitted by Italy to the Open-ended Working Group\r\nmerits careful consideration.\r\nIn our position paper of 15 September 1995, contained\r\nin document A/49/965, we indicated that the prospective\r\nsize of the Council should be determined on the basis of\r\nthe concepts of representativity, democracy, legitimacy,\r\nefficiency and effectiveness. We believe that the idea of\r\ncorrelating the size of the Council to its efficiency is\r\ninherently misleading.\r\nThe underlying determinant of the efficiency of the\r\nCouncil is the support of Member States. The Council\r\ncould become more effective if it were perceived by the\r\ninternational community as being more equitably\r\nrepresentative of the general membership, and thus more\r\nauthoritative in its decisions. The present dichotomy — a\r\nCouncil that is relatively more efficient in its deliberations,\r\nyet less effective in the implementation of its decisions —\r\ncalls for thorough consideration.\r\nTherefore, in accordance with the view of the majority\r\nof Member States, only a Security Council with at least 25\r\nmembers would be sufficiently representative, as well as\r\nmore effective and efficient. It should be enlarged by an\r\nadditional 10 non-permanent members. Thus, the existing\r\nratio of one permanent member to two non-permanent\r\nmembers would be reorganized as one to four. These new,\r\nadditional seats should be rotated between countries on a\r\npredetermined list, the number of which could be fixed\r\nbetween 30 and 40. The countries to be included in the list\r\ncould be selected according to a set of objective criteria.\r\nThe criteria and the list should be flexible so that they\r\ncould be updated after a certain period of time; that is,\r\nthere should be a mechanism that would ensure that\r\npolitical and economic changes on the international scene\r\nwould be regularly reflected in the composition of the\r\nCouncil. The review of the list could be carried out every\r\n12 or 16 years.\r\nThis proposal also calls for a new assessment of the\r\nconcept of constituencies in the distribution of seats in the\r\nCouncil. As stated in our first written proposal, of 28\r\nJune 1993, present arrangements for the geographical\r\ndistribution of the non-permanent seats in the Council,\r\nadopted in 1963, are outdated. With the enlargement of\r\nthe membership, and taking into account the recent\r\nchanges in the international political landscape, a new\r\napproach in this regard, based on the replacement of the\r\ncurrent large geographical groups by narrower\r\nconstituencies, is worth considering. Designation of\r\nseparate and smaller constituencies would further enhance\r\nthe representative character of the Council. It would also\r\nensure more equitable and balanced geographical\r\ndistribution.\r\nThe reform of the working methods of the Council\r\nconstitutes the second dimension of our work. Here, I do\r\nnot wish to go into detail on this point again. We have\r\nexplained our views in the Working Group, and we will\r\ncontinue to elaborate on them. However, I would like to\r\nemphasize the issue of sanctions. United Nations-\r\nimposed sanctions constitute an effective measure for\r\ndetermined action against violators of international law.\r\nNevertheless, there are serious shortcomings which need\r\nto be addressed. In this context, we fully endorse the\r\nSecretary-General’s views on sanctions, particularly his\r\nreference to Article 50 of the Charter. He rightly states in\r\nhis “Supplement to An Agenda for Peace”:\r\n“Sanctions are a measure taken collectively by\r\nthe United Nations to maintain or restore\r\ninternational peace and security. The costs involved\r\nin their application, like other such costs ..., should\r\nbe borne equitably by all Member States and not\r\nexclusively by the few who have the misfortune to\r\nbe neighbours or major economic partners of the\r\ntarget country.” (A/50/60, para. 73)\r\nIn addition to the content of this important\r\nobservation, the lack of efficient consultation mechanisms\r\nand the secrecy of the Council’s decision-making process\r\nregarding the imposition and review of sanctions are also\r\nof concern to the general membership. We are convinced\r\nthat transparency in the activities of the Council with\r\nrespect to sanctions will ensure wider support for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nOur aim should be to make the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup a genuine driving force for real reform. We have\r\nto create a Security Council that is more effective,\r\nrepresentative, democratic, transparent, accountable,\r\ncredible and authoritative. It is a historic task which we\r\nmust fulfil.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): In the solemn Declaration\r\n(resolution 50/6) adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we all stated that we\r\n“Are determined that the United Nations of the future\r\nwill work with renewed vigour and effectiveness in\r\npromoting peace, development, equality and justice\r\nand understanding among the peoples of the world”\r\nand that we\r\n“Will give to the twenty-first century a United Nations\r\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively\r\nthe peoples in whose name it was established.” (ibid.)\r\nThese are fundamental commitments. They were made in\r\nthe name of the peoples we represent. They were designed\r\nto be of benefit to them.\r\nIn addition to enshrining these fundamental\r\ncommitments, the Declaration addressed specifically the\r\nquestion of change in the Security Council, but it did so in\r\na definite context. No understanding of what was stated\r\nspecifically would be complete without taking that context\r\ninto account.\r\nThe question of the Security Council of the future was\r\naddressed in overarching language which stated:\r\n“In order to be able to respond effectively to the\r\nchallenges of the future and the expectations of the\r\nUnited Nations held by peoples around the world, it is\r\nessential that the United Nations itself be reformed\r\nand modernized.” (Ibid., para. 14)\r\nI wish to note that these are the terms in which\r\nAustralia is approaching the questions of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and related matters. We do not expect, nor\r\ndo we seek, direct national benefit from this process. We\r\nfervently desire the collective, shared benefits of a\r\nmodernized Council. We have taken part in the process and\r\nvigorously pursued a broadly acceptable outcome because\r\nwe are convinced that it is a necessary condition for the\r\nUnited Nations to be able to do the job expected of it by\r\nthe peoples in whose name it was established.\r\nIn its specifics, the fiftieth anniversary Declaration\r\nrecords two main sets of perceptions about the Security\r\nCouncil of the future: first, the Security Council should,\r\ninter alia, be expanded and its working methods continued\r\nto be reviewed in a way that will further strengthen its\r\ncapacity and effectiveness, enhance its representative\r\ncharacter and improve its working efficiency and\r\ntransparency; and, secondly, as important differences on\r\nkey issues continue to exist, further in-depth consideration\r\nof these issues is required.\r\nThe report of the Open-ended Working Group which\r\nwe are considering today is testimony to the application\r\nand effort that all have made towards advancing our work\r\non this important subject.\r\nThe Co-Chairmen deserve our gratitude for their\r\nsensitive work and for their integrity, which is all the\r\nmore remarkable when the uncommon pressures to which\r\nthey were, and are now being, subjected are considered.\r\nAny judgement of the efforts to date implies the\r\nexercise of a basic choice. Simply, we can decide to\r\nunderline progress or to highlight difficulties. Australia\r\nprefers the former.\r\nIn our view, considerable progress has been made\r\nover the past year. The report, including the compendium,\r\nreflects the dynamism of the discussions; the wealth of\r\nideas and proposals; and the areas on which there is a\r\nbroad measure of agreement and those on which\r\ndifferences continue to exist. In addition, the report\r\nreflects important political commitments. These are: the\r\ncommitment to continue the search for an outcome that is\r\nacceptable to all, and the widespread determination that\r\nwe should aim to achieve a result as soon as possible.\r\nAs we move ahead, we must not lose sight of why\r\nthis work is important. Reform of the Security Council —\r\nthe creation of a modern and more effective Security\r\nCouncil — will play an integral role in the process of\r\nrevitalizing the United Nations.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group must, therefore,\r\ncontinue its mandate. It is the forum in which we can\r\ncontinue to pursue a productive discussion on the range\r\nof issues we have to address. This process has been\r\ngreatly facilitated by the informal consultations that have\r\nbeen held by the Co-Chairmen, and it could well be\r\nexpanded. Whatever the outcome of such processes, their\r\nresults must be returned to the General Assembly, and\r\nthat means first to its Working Group. We strongly\r\nrecommend that this overall approach be maintained. It\r\nhas many virtues and, not least, it is relatively resistant to\r\npopulist oversimplification of what is at stake in, and how\r\nwe can secure change in, the Security Council.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nIn considering the Working Group’s report, looking to\r\nthe future and consistent with the approach of emphasizing\r\nprogress rather than difficulties, there appear to be three\r\nissues on which there is a broad measure of agreement.\r\nThese are, first, that the Security Council must be enlarged;\r\nsecondly, that two principles should govern that\r\nenlargement — that it be made more representative of the\r\noverall membership of the United Nations, and that it not\r\nbe enlarged to a number of members that would reduce its\r\nworking efficiency, simply because of the size to which it\r\nhad grown; and, thirdly, that in the forthcoming expansion\r\nof the Council the present five permanent members will\r\nremain permanent members.Australia agrees to the\r\napproaches represented by these three points.\r\nFurthermore, there appear to be a number of issues on\r\nwhich there is a considerable measure of convergence of\r\nviews, but on which there is perhaps not quite the same\r\nmeasure of agreement as on the three points I have just\r\nlisted. These measures are: first, expansion of the\r\nmembership should be balanced in two specific ways. It\r\nshould be in both the present categories of membership —\r\npermanent and non-permanent — and it should create a\r\nCouncil in which there is balanced representation between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, reflecting fully\r\nequitable geographical distribution. Secondly, agreement on\r\nthe expansion of the Council must be decided upon as a\r\nwhole package, addressing all the issues of an increase in\r\nmembership, size and balance as a whole.\r\nAustralia is broadly in agreement with the two points\r\nI have just enumerated, and, for our part, we are firmly of\r\nthe view, deriving from those points, that Japan and\r\nGermany should be accorded permanent seats. But we also\r\nrecognize the force of the argument that to provide a\r\nmodern balance in the permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil a small number of developing country Member\r\nStates from other regions should also be accorded such\r\nmembership.\r\nIf we look ahead on the basis of those three, or five,\r\npoints, then a fairly clear perspective can be obtained on\r\nthe issues on which we need to continue to focus more\r\nsharply in the future. These are: the method of selection of\r\nmembers of the Council in order to ensure that the criteria\r\nof representation of the overall membership and\r\neffectiveness of the Council are met; in this context, the\r\nquestion of what kind of amendment of the Charter would\r\nbe required to bring about a new Council; and, finally, the\r\nquestion of what might best be done, within existing or new\r\ncategories of membership, to bring about the desired result.\r\nIn addition, there is another important issue: methods\r\nof decision-making within a new Council. A key question\r\nin that context is that of the veto, on which Australia’s\r\nviews have been stated fully in the Working Group.\r\nIn conclusion, there should be no doubt that these\r\nrelated issues — the number of permanent members, their\r\nrepresentative character and identities, and the use to\r\nwhich their powers are put, including the veto — are keys\r\nto agreement on a revised, modern Security Council, as\r\nis the fundamental need to produce a Council more\r\nrepresentative of the membership of the United Nations as\r\na whole, but of a size that remains efficient.\r\nThe debate on this subject has, as the report reflects,\r\nbeen long and detailed, and it is familiar to all of us.\r\nAustralia’s view is that action is required. There is no\r\nlack of ideas. What we must now do is seek political\r\nconsensus on a new Security Council, a Council that will\r\nbe effective, will represent the whole membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, and will sensibly reflect the realities of\r\ntoday and those visible in the future.\r\nMr. Kimberg (Denmark): I am speaking on behalf\r\nof the Nordic countries — that is, Finland, Iceland,\r\nNorway, Sweden and my own country, Denmark.\r\nThe question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council\r\nremains high on the agenda for reform of the United\r\nNations. The Nordic countries find that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group has done very useful work during the\r\npast year. We welcome the report presented to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as the Vice-Chairmen’s\r\nobservations on and assessment of the progress of the\r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group, included in\r\ndocument A/49/965.\r\nThe Nordic countries have contributed actively to the\r\ndebate on this question. I refer, in particular, to the\r\nposition paper submitted to the Working Group by the\r\nNordic countries in June this year, which is included in\r\nthe document I have just referred to. I would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to highlight some of the elements of that\r\npaper and to elaborate further on a few of them.\r\nThe fundamental objective of an enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council should be to strengthen its capacity to\r\ndischarge the duties assigned to it by the Charter for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. To\r\nachieve this objective, the composition of the Council\r\nmust better reflect the realities of today’s world. Special\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nimportance should be attached to the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical representation.\r\nAt the same time, the Council’s decision-making\r\nefficiency must be retained and its ability to implement its\r\ndecisions enhanced. In particular, it is important that the\r\nveto not weaken the Security Council’s ability to play the\r\nrole assigned to it by the Charter. The question of\r\nadditional vetoes should therefore be considered in the\r\nbroader context of decision-making in the Council. The\r\nNordic countries believe that the total size of the Security\r\nCouncil should be in the low twenties, preferably 23. Five\r\nnew seats could be allocated as permanent seats for\r\nqualified States. The aim should be to better reflect present\r\npolitical and economic realities, including better\r\nrepresentation for Africa, Latin America and Asia in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn order to ensure equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, it is also essential to increase the number of\r\nnon-permanent members. Regional groups should be\r\nencouraged to establish equitable systems of rotation for\r\nnon-permanent members. Such arrangements should remain\r\nwithin the competence of the regional groups themselves.\r\nWe would also like to emphasize that in the interest of the\r\nvast majority of Member States, the ban on the immediate\r\nre-election of non-permanent members of the Council\r\nshould be maintained. We further believe that the question\r\nof the composition of the Security Council should be\r\nre-examined a suitable period of time after the entry into\r\nforce of changes resulting from our present consideration.\r\nAs to the working methods of the Security Council,\r\nthe Nordic countries welcome the measures already taken\r\nand the practices adopted by the Council to enhance its\r\nworking methods and make its work more transparent. We\r\nthink that further steps should be taken to involve the\r\nMember States more closely in the work of the Council and\r\nthat consideration should also be given to formalizing steps\r\nalready taken. It is particularly important that\r\ninstitutionalized consultations between the Security Council\r\nand troop-contributing countries take place when mandates\r\nfor peace-keeping operations are extended or modified and,\r\nwhenever possible, with potential troop-contributing\r\ncountries before a decision is taken by the Council to\r\nlaunch a new operation. With regard to the future work of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group, the Nordic countries\r\nsupport the suggestions contained in paragraphs 31 to 33 of\r\nthe Vice-Chairmen’s observations and assessment.\r\nThe future Bureau, together with the Secretariat,\r\nshould analyse the views expressed in the general debate,\r\nin the Special Commemorative Meeting and in the debate\r\nunder this agenda item and submit that analysis to the\r\nWorking Group. The Bureau should present as soon as\r\npossible a programme for the future work of the Working\r\nGroup and prepare new texts for the Working Group’s\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe, the Nordic countries, believe that the time has\r\ncome to move to the next phase of our work, to enter into\r\na process of actual negotiations. The Working Group\r\nshould attempt to make substantial progress during the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. The Nordic\r\ncountries share the objective, expressed by the two Vice-\r\nChairmen, of crystallizing different ideas and narrowing\r\ndown differences. Through this approach, a single\r\nnegotiating text could emerge from the Working Group’s\r\ndiscussions, consultations and negotiations.\r\nSuccessful reform must, in the end, be a result of\r\npolitical will. Nevertheless, adequate resources provided\r\nby the Secretariat are a necessary requirement for\r\nbringing our work together. Let me assure the Assembly\r\nthat the Nordic countries remain dedicated to the further\r\nwork of the Working Group.\r\nMr. Muthaura (Kenya): The question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council is a subject that has engaged the\r\nattention of Member States for quite some time now. The\r\ninterest and active debate that it has generated are proof\r\nof Member States’ interest and the importance they attach\r\nto it. There is general agreement that the Security Council\r\nshould be reformed to enhance its effectiveness,\r\ntransparency and accountability and the legitimacy of its\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe report of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nreform of the Security Council has highlighted the areas\r\nrequiring reform.\r\nThere is general consensus on the need to expand\r\nthe membership of the Council. Kenya is of the view that\r\nexpansion of the membership on the basis of the principle\r\nof equitable geographical distribution and democratization\r\nof the Council would be the surest way of meeting\r\nexpectations. Regions which are currently unrepresented\r\nor underrepresented in the permanent-seat category should\r\nbe favoured in the allocation of new seats in both\r\ncategories in order to correct the existing imbalance. At\r\nthe same time, periodic reviews of the permanent\r\nmembership would be necessary so as to take into\r\naccount the evolving realities of the world situation.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nWe appreciate the circumstances that gave rise to the\r\ncreation of the permanent and non-permanent seats in the\r\nSecurity Council 50 years ago. However, as we have stated\r\nin this Assembly in the past, because of the significant and\r\nfar-reaching changes that have taken place in the arena of\r\ninternational relations, the criteria for selection in both\r\ncategories of membership need to be re-examined critically\r\nto take into account the new realities.\r\nMy delegation has previously expressed the view that\r\nthe Security Council should be expanded to at least 25\r\nmembers. We still subscribe to this view, as we feel that it\r\nis possible to distribute the seats in a fairer way with this\r\nnumber of members and to correct the imbalance that has\r\ncharacterized the Council’s membership to date. We are of\r\nthe view that the current two-year term of office for the\r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council has\r\nworked well and should therefore be continued. This\r\nsystem, while affording an opportunity for Member States\r\nto have a role in discharging the responsibilities that go\r\nwith membership, also ensures that as many States as\r\npossible are given the opportunity to present their\r\ncandidature for election. The procedure for the nomination\r\nof permanent and non-permanent members should be\r\nreserved for regional groups, with elections carried out by\r\nthe Assembly, as has been the practice for the non-\r\npermanent seats. At the same time, we are of the view that\r\nthe length of permanent membership needs to be pegged to\r\na specific term in such a way that periodic reviews are\r\ncarried out at the end of that fixed term, with the possibility\r\nof new permanent members being elected to replace the old\r\nones.\r\nThe Charter bestows upon the Security Council, one\r\nof the major organs of the United Nations, the primary\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity on behalf of the general membership. This\r\nresponsibility should be exercised effectively and\r\nimpartially by the Council on behalf of the general\r\nmembership, irrespective of whether the threat to peace is\r\ndirected towards a small or a big State, and whatever the\r\ngeographical region. In this respect, the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking process is of paramount importance. This calls for\r\ngreater transparency and accountability in the Council’s\r\nworking methods.\r\nWe appreciate the measures taken so far by the\r\nSecurity Council with regard to informal consultations with\r\ntroop-contributing countries in respect of peace-keeping\r\nmatters. In this regard, it should be recognized that some of\r\nthe decisions taken to deal with threats to international\r\nsecurity in a particular country in any region have far-\r\nreaching regional dimensions, which more often than not\r\nadversely affect countries neighbouring the one at the\r\ncentre of the conflict.\r\nIn this connection, it is my delegation’s view that\r\ninterested countries should be given ample opportunity for\r\ninformal and formal consultations with the Security\r\nCouncil to assist the Council in its decision-making\r\nprocess. Almost invariably, the neighbouring countries\r\nbear a heavy burden as a result of fall-out of various\r\ntypes from the country of conflict. It is therefore\r\nnecessary for the Council and the countries thus affected\r\nto have consultations with a view to finding effective\r\nways and means of dealing with the situation.\r\nWith regard to the veto power, my delegation is of\r\nthe view that the veto is a negative instrument, which\r\ncannot play a useful role in the changed circumstances,\r\ncharacterized by consultation and consensus. It is\r\nanachronistic and undemocratic. It is a legacy of the cold\r\nwar and has now been rendered obsolete.\r\nWe should seize the opportunity offered by the\r\nfiftieth anniversary to revitalize the Organization and\r\nenhance its effectiveness so that it may serve us better in\r\nthe next millennium. It is my delegation’s view that the\r\nSecurity Council has, by and large, proved to be effective\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe must not lose the opportunity to revitalize it, make it\r\nmore democratic, improve its credibility and ensure that\r\nit reflects the universality of the Organization.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is 6.02 p.m. We have thus heard the last speaker in the\r\ndebate for today. The remaining speakers will be heard\r\ntomorrow. The morning meeting will begin at 10 o’clock.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 13 November 1995\r\nIn this regard I appeal, on behalf of the President of\r\nthe General Assembly, who will be in the Chair tomorrow,\r\nfor promptness. Secondly, I appeal to delegations to\r\nobserve the 10-minute limit on speeches.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nMr. Pibulsonggram (Thailand), Vice-President, in the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that agenda item 38, entitled “The situation of\r\ndemocracy and human rights in Haiti”, will be taken up on\r\nTuesday, 21 November, in the morning as the second item.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
