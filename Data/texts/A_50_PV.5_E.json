(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3:15 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Armando Calderón Sol, President of the\r\nRepublic of El Salvador\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Armando Calderón Sol, President of the Republic\r\nof El Salvador, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador, His Excellency\r\nMr. Armando Calderón Sol, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Calderón Sol (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nAt the outset, in addressing this distinguished Assembly, I\r\nshould like to express to you, Mr. President, our sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election to conduct the proceedings\r\nof this fiftieth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nassured that with your qualities as a statesman and your\r\ndiplomatic skills, we shall achieve very constructive results\r\nfor the well-being of the international community,\r\nespecially at this most important time when we are\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth year of the existence of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe should also like to congratulate His Excellency,\r\nMr. Amara Essy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, for the excellent work that he carried out\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\r\nsession.\r\nIt is both a timely moment and a pleasure to\r\nhighlight the extraordinary and indefatigable performance\r\nof the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at\r\nthe helm of the United Nations. He has demonstrated\r\noutstanding leadership, dynamism and innovative skill in\r\nimproving and strengthening the Organization’s capacity\r\nfor action in fulfilment of the provisions of the Charter\r\nand of efforts to find solutions for the diverse and\r\ncomplex situations which have faced the Organization.\r\nWe would like to reaffirm our special gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his ongoing support in the\r\nprocess of consolidating and strengthening democracy in\r\nEl Salvador.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is\r\nparticularly important in the historical development of the\r\nUnited Nations, not only because we are celebrating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional\r\ninstitution of universal scope, which was established to\r\nanalyse, debate and seek solutions to problems of\r\ncommon concern to mankind, but also because current\r\ncircumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the\r\nfuture of our Organization.\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nIndeed, we have at this time a unique opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our commitment and our political will to\r\nstrengthen the role of the Organization, to enhance its\r\neffectiveness in achieving the ideals on which it was\r\nfounded, to bring to fruition the aspirations of our peoples,\r\nand to preserve the right of future generations to live in\r\npeace, progress and freedom.\r\nUndeniably, this is a year for reflection, one which\r\nwill enable us to assess carefully a half-century of\r\ndevelopment and experience acquired in addressing global\r\nissues through joint efforts and collective measures on a\r\nmultilateral basis, taking into account not only the\r\nachievements but also the set-backs, with a view to further\r\nperfecting this human endeavour.\r\nThe work of the United Nations, as a part of the\r\ninternational system established in the wake of the Second\r\nWorld War, reflected the antagonistic nature of international\r\nrelations during the cold-war period, which generated\r\ntension and insecurity for nations, unleashing an unbridled\r\narms race and the threat of a nuclear conflict between the\r\nsuper-Powers. This was no doubt a key factor in shaping,\r\nand limiting, the work of the Organization.\r\nAs we make our assessment, we must acknowledge\r\nthat since 1945, despite the existence of the cold war, the\r\nUnited Nations has achieved much, inter alia, in the\r\nfollowing spheres: fulfilling its mission to establish and\r\nmaintain international peace and security, containing local\r\nconflicts in various regions from spreading and at the same\r\ntime creating a safety valve for East-West tensions, which\r\nprevented a political and ideological conflict from\r\ndegenerating into a widespread confrontation or into nuclear\r\nwarfare.\r\nAnother achievement, in accordance with the Charter,\r\nwas the decolonization process by which many Asian and\r\nAfrican countries, and some on the American continent,\r\ngained independence and joined the community of nations,\r\nthus enriching the Organization by their experience and\r\ncontributions.\r\nIn this regard, the United Nations has also helped to\r\nfoster international cooperation. To this end, an institutional\r\ninfrastructure was developed to promote economic and\r\nsocial development for our peoples through the\r\nestablishment of a new international economic order, one\r\nthat would generate more favourable conditions and\r\nopportunities for the developing countries to make progress,\r\nthus setting in motion a process of evening out the major\r\nimbalances between North and South.\r\nWhile these efforts contributed to improving social\r\nconditions in the poorest countries and in countries that\r\nhad recently gained independence, certain perceptions and\r\nattitudes led to a development crisis in the 1980s,\r\ncurtailing the activities of the United Nations system in\r\nthe least developed countries.\r\nTurning to the realm of human rights, considerable\r\nprogress was made, beginning with the signing of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December\r\n1948 and the adoption of a host of international\r\ninstruments, declarations, plans of action and institutional\r\nmachinery for the promotion and monitoring of\r\ninternational commitments on the part of States. These\r\ninclude the promotion of the development of women, the\r\nrights of children, the handicapped, minority groups,\r\nindigenous peoples and migrant workers, and, in\r\nparticular, a commitment to the struggle to eliminate\r\nracial discrimination in South Africa, which culminated in\r\n1994 with the establishment of a democratic and\r\nmultiracial system in that country.\r\nIn the field of international law, outstanding progress\r\nwas made in the drawing up and codification of\r\ninternational standards, in particular those conducive to\r\nfriendly relations among peoples and to the peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts.\r\nThe thoroughgoing changes in the world order that\r\nled to the end of the cold war are giving rise to the\r\nexpectation of more favourable conditions for the\r\npromotion of peace, cooperation and international\r\nsecurity. None the less, reality has shown that these\r\naspirations have not been met and that, on the contrary,\r\nchanges in the international system created conditions that\r\nhave unleashed forces that had long been held in check,\r\ngiving rise to new conflicts and rivalries, not only as a\r\nresult of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of\r\nserious ethnic, religious, social and cultural differences\r\nwhich have jeopardized peace and international security.\r\nIn this context, we are convinced that at the present\r\ntime finding solutions to age-old and new challenges is\r\nbeyond the capacity of any one State or group of States.\r\nThis has generated new requirements in the global\r\npolitical area, requiring to resort more and more\r\nfrequently to combined efforts and action. The very\r\ndynamics and requirements of this process have in turn\r\nincreased the tasks and responsibilities that fall to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nFor this reason we must provide unwavering support\r\nto the efforts of the United Nations to fulfil its role, not\r\nonly in the political sphere but also in the economic and\r\nsocial areas, particularly through innovations and new\r\nperceptions in peace-keeping and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nRegarding efforts at global peace-keeping, it is\r\nimportant to note the new dimension of these peace-keeping\r\noperations, whose action transcends the military aspects,\r\nmoving into multidisciplinary activities that include\r\npolitical, economic, social and humanitarian endeavours.\r\nAs regards development, we welcome the fact that\r\nmore attention has been paid to economic, social and\r\nenvironmental issues, with an understanding that their\r\nsolution requires coming to grips with, and attempting to\r\nfind solutions to, the causes of tensions, instability and\r\nconflicts with greater political will. As such tensions can go\r\nbeyond the very borders of nation States, we must lend our\r\nsupport to an integrated approach, for only in this way can\r\nwe consolidate peace, security and democracy, both\r\nnationally and internationally.\r\nProof of the will to improve the well-being of nations\r\nand assist in their progress can be seen in the major summit\r\nconferences that have been held, as well as in the\r\nformulation of the Secretary-General’s development\r\nprogramme. These efforts serve as examples of a new\r\nglobal vision to achieve a consensus on policies and\r\nstrategies to promote sustainable human development. None\r\nthe less, we cannot but be concerned at the statements made\r\nby the donor community regarding the drying up of funds\r\nfor development. This is certainly against the general\r\nexpectation of support for the development of our peoples.\r\nToday, the United Nations has different, and more\r\ncomplex, responsibilities than those it had in a bipolar\r\nworld. Although the purposes and principles that inspired\r\nthe United Nations at its inception still remain valid, none\r\nthe less political situations and the complexity and\r\nmagnitude of the challenges we face require clear and\r\ninnovative responses.\r\nIn the face of these challenges we must be both\r\ndetermined and prudent, resolved to be advocates of\r\nchange, learning from positive experiences and willing to\r\nreplace those outmoded practices that impede the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the Organization.\r\nWe believe that the modernization of the United\r\nNations should be carried out through a comprehensive\r\nprocess of an integrated nature which would reflect a\r\nconsensus deriving from the common interests and shared\r\nresponsibilities of the international community.\r\nIn this respect, we believe that there should be a\r\nmore dynamic, better-coordinated relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, one which requires, as the\r\nSecretary-General himself stated, “the determination and\r\nthe full commitment of all Member States”. The\r\nindustrialized countries bear a special responsibility in this\r\ntask, given that with their capabilities and resources they\r\ncan provide the Organization with a broad and assured\r\nfinancial base which will make it possible to enhance its\r\neffectiveness in every sphere.\r\nIn this connection, we urge the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the seven industrialized Powers to put into\r\npractice the statement of intention they made at the\r\ntwenty-first Economic Summit, held in Halifax, Canada,\r\nin June 1995. We call on those countries, along with\r\nothers, to implement a new strategy for international\r\ncooperation in order to rise to the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council falls within the\r\nprocess of change in the Organization. We support the\r\nidea that the Council should adjust to the new\r\ninternational structure, not only regarding the number of\r\nits members but also regarding its methods and\r\nprocedures of decision-making.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador supports an increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council on a rational\r\nbasis which will make its more truly representative and,\r\nas a result, afford greater opportunities for participation\r\nby all Member States, without in any way undermining\r\nthe efficient implementation of the tasks assigned to this\r\nimportant body by the Charter.\r\nFurthermore, we support all those nations which\r\naspire with legitimate right to becoming Members of the\r\nUnited Nations and invoke the principle of universality\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the Organization, without\r\ntaking into consideration ideological aspects or the\r\ninterests of States which carry greater political weight in\r\nthe concert of nations. In this respect we share the views\r\nexpressed by you, Mr. President, when in your opening\r\naddress to this session of the General Assembly you said\r\nthat\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\n“all States that are not yet Members should seek to be\r\nadmitted in the near future” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n1st meeting, p.22)\r\nI should now like to refer to some specific issues that\r\nare of particular importance in the international political\r\narena.\r\nWith respect to nuclear disarmament we support full\r\ncompliance with the commitments contained in the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which\r\nwas extended indefinitely last May. We are convinced that\r\nthis constitutes a major step towards the strengthening of\r\nthe control system for nuclear non-proliferation and the\r\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nWe are fully convinced that preventive diplomacy in\r\nits various manifestations is the appropriate instrument for\r\ndeterrence and the limitation of potential conflicts. In this\r\nrespect we concur with the statement by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his latest report presented to the General\r\nAssembly that\r\n“it is ... better to prevent conflicts ... than to undertake\r\nmajor politico-military efforts to resolve conflicts once\r\nthey have broken out”. (A/50/l, para. 585)\r\nWe support his efforts to enable the United Nations to carry\r\nout a constructive and timely role so as to avoid or mitigate\r\nthe destructive effects of crises.\r\nI should now like to express a regional point of view\r\nand note with satisfaction that Central America has moved\r\nfrom an era of confrontation to one of cooperation. We are\r\nnow embarking on a stage of constructive achievements\r\nwhich has enabled us to move forward in our quest to\r\nconsolidate a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment. This new stage results from our having\r\nassumed our historical responsibility with determination,\r\ngiven the legitimate aspirations of our peoples, who\r\nclamored for peace and the democratization of our societies.\r\nWith the assistance and solidarity of the United Nations and\r\nthe international community we are achieving these\r\nobjectives, which will be completed when the process under\r\nway in Guatemala concludes with a firm and lasting peace\r\nagreement, which has the decisive support of our\r\nGovernments.\r\nNow that we have made significant headway in the\r\npolitical sphere we are focusing our efforts on the social\r\nsphere as an indispensable ingredient, in the conviction that\r\npeace, democracy and development are essential\r\ncomponents for the flourishing of our society.\r\nGiven this undeniable reality, the Central American\r\nPresidents have been meeting together to exchange ideas\r\nand experiences so that jointly, with a sense of solidarity\r\nand coordination, we can rise to meet the ever-more-\r\ncomplex challenges that face us as a result of the process\r\nof political, economic, social and environmental\r\nglobalization which characterizes the new world order. An\r\nexample of this was the signing of the Treaty on Central\r\nAmerican social integration, which took place at the\r\npresidential summit held at the beginning of this year in\r\nthe city of San Salvador.\r\nMoreover, we are pleased to inform the Assembly\r\nthat in the past 12 months we have held meetings at the\r\nhighest level in Guacimo, Costa Rica; in Masaya,\r\nNicaragua; in Tegucigalpa, Honduras; and in San\r\nSalvador, the capital of my own country, during which we\r\nadopted critical decisions for the future of our peoples.\r\nWe defined our priorities in a new regional agenda which\r\nwas given concrete expression by the signing of the\r\nalliance for sustainable development. This embodies both\r\na strategy and a coordination of interests and\r\nresponsibilities with legal harmonization and emphasis on\r\ninvestment in the social sphere, as we recognize that\r\nhuman beings are the pivotal point and the principal\r\nsubject of development.\r\nThe breadth and magnitude of the objectives spelled\r\nout in the new strategy for development exceed the\r\ncapacities and resources of our countries, and we believe\r\nthat the international community can contribute\r\ngenerously towards bringing these strategies to fruition.\r\nIn this context we ascribe particular importance to\r\nthe strengthening of the newly revamped Central\r\nAmerican Integration System (SICA) which has assumed\r\nas one of its main responsibilities the promotion and\r\nimplementation of the new Central American agenda.\r\nMay we urge the Assembly to extend the observer status\r\nwe have applied for to this new organization, SICA.\r\nWe can affirm that Central America has now entered\r\na new era in its history characterized by ongoing\r\ncooperation among our countries, as reflected in our\r\nefforts to create the conditions which will overcome the\r\nobstacles which have done such damage to the cause of\r\nintegration, so that we can move forward steadfastly\r\ntowards the unification of Central America.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nIn this connection we are particularly pleased at the\r\nrecent progress made during the binational Honduras/El\r\nSalvador Commission meeting with a view to complying\r\nwith the border demarcation arrangements guaranteeing the\r\nrights of the inhabitants of the border zones on both sides\r\nsimultaneously.\r\nIn the specific case of my own country we can give a\r\ncategorical assurance that in the three years since the\r\nsigning of the peace agreements, El Salvador has moved\r\nforward in a constructive way. The commitment of the\r\nGovernment is firm and unswerving in its determination to\r\nharness the requisite strength to build a new country, a\r\nmodern, democratic El Salvador, in which all the sectors of\r\nSalvadorian society will participate without discrimination.\r\nAfter more than a year at the helm I am pleased to\r\nstate that my Government is fulfilling the promises\r\ncontained in the inaugural address which I delivered to the\r\nSalvadorian people on 1 June 1994. We have been duly\r\nfollowing up the peace agreements conceived by the entire\r\nnation as a commitment and as an essential prerequisite for\r\nmoving forward without any possibility of backsliding as\r\nwe build a peaceful society.\r\nDuring the period of transition from war to peace and\r\nnational reconstruction we have devoted ourselves to\r\nconsolidating the pacification process in the conviction that\r\nthat is a task that must be shared in a responsible manner\r\namong the entire population. That task involves not only\r\nfinding a solution to the immediate problems created by 12\r\nyears of armed confrontation, but in addition, providing a\r\ncomprehensive response to domestic problems, for only\r\nthus can we guarantee that the process will be irreversible\r\nand capable of meeting future challenges in a society of\r\nstability and peace.\r\nConcerning pending commitments under the Peace\r\nAgreements, we acknowledge realistically and in a\r\nconstructive spirit that there have been problems, and hence\r\ndelays, in complying with some of those provisions as a\r\nresult of the highly complex nature of the process. Those\r\ndifficulties have been overcome through dialogue and\r\nconsensus among the sectors responsible for\r\nimplementation. This has enabled us, with the assistance of\r\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador, to\r\nalter the established time-tables and to agree on a work\r\nprogramme for the definitive completion of those\r\ncommitments.\r\nWe can affirm that we are complying in a responsible\r\nmanner with the implementation of the Agreements, but if\r\nfor logistical reasons some components were still to be\r\npending on 31 October next, given that our determination\r\nto comply with those commitments remains steadfast we\r\nwould request the Secretary-General to extend the residual\r\nUnited Nations Mission in El Salvador.\r\nOur responsibility as a Government goes beyond\r\ncompliance with the Peace Agreements, for we must\r\nprovide a comprehensive response to our national\r\nproblems. Hence, with an awareness that lack of\r\nopportunity in our society leads to frustration and despair,\r\ncreating tensions and conflicts that jeopardize the peace\r\nprocess, we have made additional efforts to implement an\r\nambitious economic plan to develop our society, taking as\r\nour goals the betterment of human welfare, the systematic\r\nalleviation of poverty, and priority attention to health and\r\neducation, in addition to promoting productive\r\nemployment and generally meeting the basic needs of the\r\npopulation, especially its most vulnerable sectors that\r\nhave traditionally been denied the fruits of economic and\r\nsocial progress.\r\nWe are pleased to report that our Government has\r\nassigned the highest priority to the maintenance of\r\nmacroeconomic stability through the implementation of a\r\nconsistent and coherent set of monetary, exchange-rate\r\nand fiscal policies. This has enabled us to achieve specific\r\neconomic targets, namely, the maintenance of a stable\r\nexchange rate, the reining in of inflation, the elimination\r\nof our fiscal deficit and the reduction of public\r\nexpenditure, which has been redirected to social\r\ninvestment and basic infrastructure.\r\nOur Government is fully convinced that if we are to\r\nenjoy sustained medium- and long-term growth it must be\r\nbased on an efficient and competitive productive sector,\r\nboth domestically and internationally, and to that end we\r\nhave adopted the requisite economic policy measures.\r\nAmong these I would mention in particular the\r\nprogramme to reduce tariffs on the import of capital\r\ngoods, inputs and raw materials; support for further\r\ndevelopment of the Central American Common Market;\r\nthe creation of instruments to facilitate and provide\r\nguarantees to foreign investors; decisive support for\r\nprogrammes to enhance the competitiveness of the\r\ndomestic production base; the promotion of small and\r\nmicro enterprises; the development of intensive job-\r\ntraining programmes; and the implementation of our\r\nnational environment strategy as a component of\r\nsustainable development in El Salvador.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nTo achieve those objectives the entire population of\r\nmy country is striving to overcome resentment and\r\nantagonisms between different social sectors and thereby\r\nhelping to foster the conditions for national stability with a\r\nview to consolidating peace, strengthening democracy and\r\nsecuring economic and social progress.\r\nThe successful example of El Salvador clearly\r\ndemonstrates that a Member State of the Organization,\r\nacting in good faith, with transparency and political will,\r\ncan overcome situations of severe conflict, principally\r\nthrough the efforts of its own population but also with the\r\ntimely assistance of the international community.\r\nToday, following this exceptional effort to achieve\r\npeace — an effort that is, indeed, still under way — El\r\nSalvador is a country that has learned major historical\r\nlesson. Foremost among them is the knowledge that within\r\nour national community we share a common destiny and\r\nthat within the international community all major\r\nundertakings are shared. Learning from those truths, the\r\nchallenge facing us all is to build a more human world for\r\nthe benefit of present and future generations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of El Salvador\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Armando Calderón Sol, President of the Republic\r\nof El Salvador, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMr. Derycke (Belgium), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Belarus, His Excellency Mr. Uladzimir\r\nSyanko.\r\nMr. Syanko (Belarus): First of all I wish to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election\r\nto the distinguished post of President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fiftieth, jubilee session. I am sure that his\r\npersonal and professional qualities will serve as a solid\r\nguarantee that during this particularly important session the\r\nUnited Nations will achieve new concrete steps in its search\r\nfor ways to meet the complicated challenges facing\r\nhumanity.\r\nI wish to express our gratitude to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Amara Essy, and to the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nWe are proud that Belarus was at the origin of the\r\ncreation of the United Nations and became one of the\r\nfounding Members of the Organization, having signed the\r\nCharter of the United Nations at San Francisco. That\r\nhonourable right was a testimony to the international\r\nrecognition of the contribution made by the people of\r\nBelarus to the defeat of fascism during the Second World\r\nWar, the homage paid to the millions of Belarusians who\r\ngave their lives in the struggle for liberty and of the right\r\nof the Belarusian people to exist as a nation with its own\r\nhistory, culture and future.\r\nEmerging from the ashes of the Second World War,\r\nthe United Nations has experienced the most serious\r\ncrises and conflicts, the cold war and détente,\r\nconsiderable changes in the political map of the world\r\nand the break-up and formation of unions and blocs of\r\nStates. The Organization has coped creditably with these\r\nchallenges. Thanks to the United Nations humankind, for\r\nthe first time in its history, has acquired the opportunity\r\nto live for half a century in peace. The contribution of the\r\nUnited Nations to the process of the peaceful settlement\r\nof many conflicts is well known. One of the most\r\nimportant achievements of the United Nations is that the\r\nworld has rid itself of such odious phenomena as\r\napartheid and is close to a complete eradication of\r\ncolonialism, another no less odious remnant of the past.\r\nIt is also appropriate to note the role of the United\r\nNations in elaborating and adopting universal documents\r\nin the sphere of human rights, as well as in establishing\r\nthe supremacy of international law.\r\nThe hopes and expectations of the peoples associated\r\nwith the United Nations are convincing evidence of the\r\nimportant role of the Organization at this stage. The tasks\r\nthat the United Nations is facing today seem to be much\r\nmore complicated than those of the past, when they were\r\ndictated by the pernicious but understandable logic of\r\nconfrontation. Today it is necessary to solve the\r\nchallenges of the future world order; and this implies the\r\nnecessity to reform the United Nations system. Reform of\r\nthe United Nations, including that of the Security Council,\r\none of its principal organs responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, is the\r\nwatchword of the day, and is in many respects an\r\nextremely complicated matter. But each State can and\r\nshould make its own contribution to the formation of the\r\nrenewed United Nations. This will enable the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nOrganization to reflect the diversity of the contemporary\r\nworld, the interdependence of States, the equality of great\r\nand small and the security and development of all. The\r\nreform of the United Nations should result in a more\r\neffective Organization as a whole. The reform of the\r\nSecurity Council may be carried out only on the basis of a\r\nreasonable increase in the membership of the Council, with\r\nstrict respect for the principle of the equitable geographical\r\ndistribution of additional seats among all the regions of the\r\nworld. The Belarusian delegation is convinced that the\r\nallocation of an additional seat for a non-permanent\r\nmember of the Council to the Eastern European regional\r\ngroup is fully justified and will ensure a new, emerging\r\nbalance of interests.\r\nI am sure that the United Nations will be able to adapt\r\nitself fully to the present realities, as well as duly to\r\nrespond to the demands and foreseeable global challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nAmong the most serious problems the world\r\ncommunity is facing nowadays are regional conflicts. Such\r\nconflicts are not a new problem, but in their present\r\ndimensions they represent a new challenge for the United\r\nNations. We are fully convinced that, in striving for their\r\nsettlement, the United Nations should not yield to the\r\ntemptation to use military force to accelerate the process.\r\nPeace-keeping and peace enforcement are two different and\r\nin many respects exactly opposite methods, and not links in\r\nthe same continuing chain of crisis resolution. We consider\r\nit very important not to go beyond the limits to violence\r\nand ruthlessness that are incompatible with the nature of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nOur delegation notes with satisfaction the progress\r\nmade in the settlement of the Middle East conflict. We\r\nbelieve that the continuation of the direct dialogue between\r\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) will\r\nfinally lead to a comprehensive solution providing for\r\nrespect for the right of all States of the region to live in\r\npeace within internationally recognized borders. We deeply\r\nregret the terrorist acts that are periodically carried out in\r\nthe region and which considerably hamper the peace\r\nprocess. Such acts must be severely condemned.\r\nThe Balkan conflict is of special concern to us. The\r\npresent developments in this region are fraught with the\r\nrisk of large-scale military activities in Europe.\r\nThe unresolved conflicts within the post-Soviet\r\nterritories are still acute.\r\nFrom this lofty rostrum I should like once again to\r\nemphasize the unequivocal renunciation by Belarus of\r\nforce to solve existing problems and the need to search\r\nfor ways to settle conflicts peacefully by political means.\r\nThis leads me to the conviction for the necessity of\r\nfurther strengthening cooperation between the United\r\nNations and European regional and subregional\r\norganizations and agreements, especially the Organization\r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Belarus\r\nstands for the broadening of interaction between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates (CIS) not only in the sphere of conflict settlement\r\non the territory of the former Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics (USSR), but also in the fields of disarmament,\r\nprotection of the environment and the eradication of\r\nterrorism and organized crime.\r\nAgainst a background of heightened confrontation in\r\nsome regions of the world, one cannot but rejoice at\r\nsignificant achievements in the consolidation of\r\ninternational security. We welcome the adoption by the\r\n1995 Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of the historic\r\ndecision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty. Belarus\r\nhas been and remains a supporter of the strengthening of\r\nthe non-proliferation regime. That is why our country,\r\nhaving clearly determined its position at an early stage,\r\nbecame a sponsor of that draft decision.\r\nAt the same time, it is necessary to remember that\r\nthe decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty was\r\nadopted as a package. It envisions the strengthening of\r\ncontrol over the implementation of its provisions and the\r\nrealization of the approved principles and aims of nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. It is a duty of the\r\nnuclear-weapon States to confirm in practice their\r\nadherence to their obligations. The most important criteria\r\nof such adherence, in our view, are further progress\r\ntowards nuclear disarmament, a comprehensive ban on\r\nnuclear tests and the inclusion of positive and negative\r\nsecurity assurances to the non-nuclear-weapon States in\r\nan instrument of international law of binding character.\r\nBelarus confirms its non-nuclear-weapon status and is\r\ndetermined to implement the provisions of the Agreement\r\non the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory in\r\nfull and on time.\r\nI am pleased to inform delegations that at the\r\nbeginning of this year the Belarusian Parliament ratified\r\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nand on their Destruction. We call upon all signatory\r\ncountries to the Convention to ratify it as soon as possible,\r\nand we again declare our support for the comprehensive\r\nban on chemical weapons.\r\nBelarus has always believed that, next to nuclear\r\ndisarmament, the limitation of conventional weapons is of\r\nenormous importance for the consolidation of international\r\npeace and security. In this connection, I should like to\r\ntouch upon the problems concerning the fulfilment of our\r\nobligations under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces\r\nin Europe.\r\nHaving assumed obligations under a Treaty in whose\r\nelaboration it did not participate, Belarus has been guided\r\nby the wish to assist in the consolidation of European and\r\ninternational security. From the very first days of the\r\nimplementation of the Treaty we spent a considerable\r\namount of resources on its implementation and on the\r\ncreation of appropriate structures and industrial capacities\r\nfor the elimination of huge stockpiles of armaments and\r\nequipment produced not for Belarus, but for the then super-\r\nPower, the Soviet Union. But as time passed it has become\r\nclear that for the young Belarusian State the elimination of\r\nthose weapons was a burden beyond its strength. Therefore,\r\nwe appealed to our Western European partners for\r\nassistance.\r\nFor a long time our appeals were unanswered, which\r\nled us to suspend the elimination process temporarily. That\r\ndecision was made due to a lack of financial resources, and\r\nhad nothing to do with issues of global and regional policy.\r\nI am glad to say today that an understanding of our\r\nproblems has recently begun to emerge. Our reaction has\r\nbeen immediate and fully adequate. As is known, the\r\nPresident of Belarus has declared that our country is\r\nresuming the elimination of conventional weapons in\r\naccordance with its obligations under the Treaty.\r\nI would also like to point out that, by special\r\nPresidential Decree, Belarus has declared a moratorium on\r\nthe export of anti-personnel land-mines for the period from\r\nSeptember 1995 until the end of 1997.\r\nOur Republic attaches paramount importance to the\r\ndevelopment of international cooperation in the economic,\r\nsocial and environmental spheres in the interests of the\r\nsustainable development of all countries. In this context, we\r\nattribute special significance to the series of world forums\r\nheld under the auspices of the United Nations in Rio de\r\nJaneiro, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing to consider\r\nproblems in such spheres as those of the environment,\r\nsocial issues, population and human rights, and to search\r\nfor ways to solve them. It is important that the decisions\r\nand recommendations of these forums be duly taken into\r\naccount and efficiently utilized in elaborating “An Agenda\r\nfor Development”, which is to determine the avenues and\r\nthe programme of human development for years to come.\r\nWe stand for the inclusion in this document of\r\nsubstantive issues related to economies in transition, a\r\nnotion which would fully reflect present realities. Belarus\r\ntakes a profound interest in supporting United Nations\r\nsystem-wide activities to promote the integration of these\r\ncountries into the world economy. We are sure that, in\r\ntoday’s world, such an integration is advantageous to all\r\nand in the interests of all.\r\nIn this connection, I should like once again to recall\r\nthe Belarusian proposal — supported by the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development at its third session and\r\napproved by a decision of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil at its substantive session — to convene in 1997\r\nan international conference on the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of countries with economies in transition.\r\nThis proposal, once realized, would be an important\r\ncontribution to the preparation of the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly in 1997 to review the\r\nimplementation of the agenda for the twenty-first century.\r\nBelarus places ardent hopes in cooperation and interaction\r\nto implement this initiative, first of all with the European\r\nUnion, the European Commission, the European Bank for\r\nReconstruction and Development and other European\r\nregional and subregional organizations, as well as with\r\ninterested partners. We also hope that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe will provide their competent assistance in\r\npreparing and convening the conference.\r\nOne of the most important directions of the activities\r\nof the reformed Organization is, in our opinion, the\r\ndevelopment of economic dialogue within the framework\r\nof the United Nations aimed at the exchange of\r\nexperience, the strengthening of the multilateral trade\r\nsystem and facilitating non-discriminatory access to world\r\nmarkets. In this connection, we consider that the speedy\r\ngranting of membership in the World Trade Organization\r\nto our country would testify to a fair attitude towards a\r\nfounding Member of the United Nations with an economy\r\nin transition.\r\nOne cannot but note that, in countries with\r\neconomies in transition, the effectiveness of tackling\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nsocial problems is directly linked with the fate of\r\ndemocratic reforms. The new economic and political\r\nconditions in which these countries find themselves require\r\nlarge-scale economic transformations and the social\r\nadaptation of all population groups. Without effective\r\ninternational support, the achievement of this goal would be\r\ndelayed for an indefinite period. It is for this reason that\r\nBelarus is interested in continuing all programmes initiated\r\nby the Organization in the social sphere.\r\nThe promotion of universal respect for, and the\r\nprotection of, human rights and fundamental freedoms is\r\none of the goals stipulated in the United Nations Charter as\r\nwell as an important component of international security. At\r\nthis jubilee session, it is appropriate to note that significant\r\nsuccess has been attained in this field since the inception of\r\nthe Organization half a century ago. The undisputed\r\nachievement of the international community is the adoption\r\nof the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the\r\nconsistent implementation of which will be conducive to\r\nsecuring universal respect for justice, the supremacy of law\r\nand human rights. Unfortunately, the path to full\r\nimplementation of human rights is strewn with many\r\nobstacles which, in our opinion, are raised by imperfect\r\nsocial relations rather than by a lack of will to exercise\r\nthese rights.\r\nWe are convinced that it is high time today to think\r\nof, and act for, the benefit of tomorrow not only by\r\nstrengthening in every possible way the mechanisms of\r\nprotection of human rights, but by taking concrete measures\r\nto study and expand the list of fundamental universal and\r\ncategorical human rights.\r\nFor more than nine years now, the Belarusians have\r\nbeen living under the conditions of an ecological disaster —\r\nthat of the Chernobyl nuclear-power plant catastrophe. The\r\nRepublic spends annually more than 20 per cent of its\r\nnational budget to mitigate the economic, ecological and\r\nmedical after-effects of the Chernobyl accident. But most\r\nhorrible is what is happening to the health and psyche of\r\nthe people. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children has\r\nincreased manifold. The birth rate has fallen 50 per cent\r\nsince the period preceding the accident. Genetic diseases\r\nare conspicuously on the rise in the most contaminated\r\nareas. As time goes by, it becomes more and more evident\r\nthat the Chernobyl catastrophe has infringed the most\r\nsacred of human rights — the right to life.\r\nWe are glad to note the important catalysing role\r\nplayed by the General Assembly and its specialized\r\nagencies in drawing the attention of the donor countries and\r\nof the international organizations to the Chernobyl\r\nproblems. As the day of the catastrophe recedes into the\r\npast, the nature of the after-effects of Chernobyl also\r\nchanges, requiring a strengthened role on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations in the development of Chernobyl-related\r\nbilateral cooperation. On its part, Belarus is ready to sign\r\nbilateral memoranda on Chernobyl cooperation with the\r\nWorld Health Organization, the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization and\r\nother agencies of the United Nations system.\r\nIn March 1996, an international conference will be\r\nconvened in Minsk, with the active participation of\r\nUNESCO and the European Commission, to\r\ncommemorate the lamentable tenth anniversary of the\r\nChernobyl accident. We express our hope that this\r\nrepresentative forum will help to step up joint efforts to\r\nstudy the after-effects of the radioactive fallout and make\r\nmore effective the efforts aimed at mitigating the fatal\r\nconsequences of the catastrophe, on the basis of the\r\nexperience accumulated by Belarus.\r\nFinally, the manifold and unfair increase in the\r\nBelarus rate of assessments to the United Nations regular\r\nbudget and to peace-keeping operations — caused by the\r\nfact that Belarus, along with the economically most\r\nadvanced countries, was related to group B — has\r\nresulted in the rapid growth of our arrears.\r\nWe note with deep satisfaction the special decision\r\nto relocate the Republic of Belarus to group C for the\r\napportionment of peace-keeping expenses which was\r\ntaken during the resumed forty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. On behalf of the Government of\r\nBelarus, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to\r\nthe delegations of all countries that displayed a spirit of\r\nunderstanding and cooperation during the consideration of\r\nthis issue. I address my special words of gratitude to the\r\nGovernment of Portugal, whose consent voluntarily to\r\nrelocate to group B opened the way for the adoption of\r\nthe aforementioned decision. I am confident that such\r\nactions are an important contribution to the governance of\r\nprinciples of justice in the work of the Organization,\r\nwhich in itself is very significant on the eve of its golden\r\njubilee. For its part, the Government of Belarus, in spite\r\nof the utmost economic difficulties, fully aware of the\r\ndepth of the United Nations financial crisis and sincerely\r\nstriving to fulfil its financial obligations to the\r\nOrganization, has decided to transfer about $2 million\r\ndollars to the United Nations budget.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nIn his fifties, a person is no longer at the peak of his\r\nphysical capacities, but acquires considerable life\r\nexperience and wisdom. I would like to express a wish that\r\nthe United Nations, once its 50-year threshold has been\r\ncrossed, will remain full of strength and health and\r\nunsurpassed in wisdom in all its deeds.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bjørn Tore Godal.\r\nMr. Godal (Norway): I wish first of all to\r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly upon\r\nhis election to his high office in the year of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. May I, at the same time,\r\nextend my sincere thanks to the outgoing President, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his excellent work.\r\nFifty years ago, my countryman Trygve Lie became\r\nSecretary-General of an Organization with a very modest\r\nstructure but with a “sacred mandate”, as he said in his\r\nacceptance speech,\r\n“to build a firm foundation for the peace of the\r\nworld”. (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFirst Session, Plenary Meetings, 22nd meeting, p. 326)\r\nSince then, even greater demands have been made on the\r\nUnited Nations in terms of leadership, ideas, manpower and\r\nfinances. On the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, we\r\nmust empower the United Nations to work with renewed\r\nvigour and effectiveness in promoting peace, human rights,\r\nsustainable development, equality, justice and understanding\r\namong peoples.\r\nRather than being poised to take on new challenges,\r\nhowever, the United Nations finds itself in a financial crisis\r\nof major proportions. The Secretary-General has recently\r\npointed out that the Organization is, in a technical sense,\r\ninsolvent — yes, bankrupt. Only prompt payment by a\r\nsmall number of Member States has enabled it to continue\r\nto operate. The situation is more serious than ever before\r\nbecause of the unprecedented amounts involved and the fact\r\nthat one major contributor’s payment is being withheld and\r\nis expected to be unilaterally reduced in the years ahead.\r\nThis desperate financial situation reflects the\r\ninadequate priority given to the United Nations by many of\r\nits Members, which is in clear violation of their obligations.\r\nIt may sound harsh, but, coming from a country which\r\nconsistently pays $100 per capita to the United Nations\r\nsystem, I have difficulties in explaining to my own\r\nelectorate that other rich countries are not even willing to\r\nprovide one tenth of that level.\r\nAt the same time, I realize that the United Nations\r\nassessment system should be reformed without delay.\r\nMoreover, experience has shown that the United Nations\r\nitself needs to be reformed, restructured and modernized.\r\nNorway wholeheartedly supports the reform process\r\nlaunched to strengthen the United Nations system and\r\nmake it more representative and effective. This should\r\ninclude expansion of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and increased transparency of its methods of\r\nwork.\r\nTo meet the twin challenges of peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the United Nations and its Member States\r\nshould proceed along five parallel paths.\r\nFirst, we must help increase local and regional\r\ncapacity to handle conflict situations. For instance,\r\nAfrican countries have signalled via the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) that they are prepared to take on a\r\nlarger share of the responsibility for solving their own\r\nproblems. In response, Norway will cooperate with\r\npartners in Southern Africa in building up standby\r\nreserves of qualified personnel for peace operations under\r\nUnited Nations or OAU auspices.\r\nSecondly, more nations must be willing to contribute\r\nto the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Traditional\r\ntroop contributors do not have the capacity to provide all\r\nthe personnel that will be needed in future peace-keeping\r\nmissions aimed at solving disputes, protecting local\r\npopulations and providing humanitarian assistance. Both\r\nthe United Nations and the traditional troop-contributing\r\ncountries must assist potential troop contributors with\r\ncompetence-building measures, just as the Nordic\r\ncountries are now assisting the Baltic States.\r\nThirdly, the rapid-reaction and standby capability of\r\nthe United Nations must be improved. Norway is\r\nprepared to join in efforts to develop new, much-needed\r\ninstruments to deal quickly and effectively with crisis\r\nsituations. The rapid-reaction capability must also include\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The United Nations should\r\ncontinue to play a central role in coordinating\r\nhumanitarian relief efforts.\r\nNorway has given high priority to measures that\r\nenable us to respond expeditiously to requests for\r\nassistance. We have established an effective preparedness\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nsystem for emergency assistance that covers both personnel\r\nand matériel. Emergency equipment can be airborne within\r\n24 hours. Experienced personnel can be in the field within\r\n72 hours. In Rwanda, a fully equipped field hospital,\r\naccompanied by the necessary personnel, was recently\r\ndelivered at short notice to the United Nations, in\r\naccordance with these procedures. With a view to\r\nimproving the United Nations response to support\r\nrequirements, Norway has offered to provide facilities for\r\na United Nations medical depot where medical equipment\r\nand supplies for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations\r\ncan be stored and maintained.\r\nFourthly, we must put even greater emphasis on\r\nconflict-prevention measures. The international community\r\nmust be present in unstable areas and must provide\r\neconomic incentives, mediation expertise and human rights\r\nmonitors. Conflict prevention is the most effective way of\r\nusing limited resources. Norway will continue to shoulder\r\nits share of the responsibility — for instance, in Guatemala,\r\nwhere we are actively involved in the peace process,\r\ntogether with the other members of the Group of Friends.\r\nNorway has established a special human-resource bank for\r\nhuman rights and democracy, which is able, at short notice,\r\nto offer experts to assist countries and peoples in their\r\nefforts to build democratic societies.\r\nThe international community must be prepared to act\r\ndecisively when atrocities are committed. Serious crimes\r\nshould be prosecuted by an international criminal tribunal.\r\nThe establishment of the ad hoc Tribunals in the former\r\nYugoslavia and Rwanda has provided momentum for the\r\nefforts to establish a permanent court. The tribunal’s role\r\nshould be limited to cases where national jurisdiction is\r\nunavailable or ineffective.\r\nFifthly, on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, we\r\ncall on the United Nations to take a decisive lead in\r\npromoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty.\r\nEfforts to improve global security must address the issues\r\nof economic growth, development and poverty, while\r\nensuring that the use of natural resources is kept within the\r\ncarrying capacity of the Earth. The United Nations must\r\nbecome a driving force for sustainable development.\r\nThe United Nations is the only forum with a mandate\r\nto tackle the truly global problems affecting the\r\nenvironment and the sustainable management of natural\r\nresources. Let me offer some brief examples. The\r\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks provided an\r\ninvaluable contribution to the management of fishery\r\nresources. We are also pleased that, just a few days ago, the\r\nUnited Nations Panel on Forests was able to take the first\r\nsteps to protect, preserve and manage the world’s forests\r\nin a sustainable manner.\r\nI would like to stress the need for a concerted effort\r\nwithin the United Nations system to ensure that the\r\nresults from the major conferences in Cairo, Copenhagen\r\nand Beijing on, respectively, population, social\r\ndevelopment and women actually become translated into\r\nlaw and realities, locally, nationally and at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nWith a growing world population, we have witnessed\r\nthe spread of the gravest insult to human dignity —\r\npoverty. Our inability to eradicate poverty haunts our\r\ncommon conscience. As long as the gap between rich and\r\npoor, whether between States or within States, continues\r\nto widen, we cannot claim to be on the right track. If we\r\nare to alleviate poverty, both donors and recipients must\r\nmake more resources available for social welfare\r\nactivities. At least 20 per cent of development assistance\r\nbudgets and national budgets of recipient countries should\r\nbe allocated to the social sector.\r\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia is far from\r\nbeing solved, even though the prospects for a negotiated\r\nsolution now appear much better than they did until\r\nrecently. Norway welcomes the agreement on basic\r\nprinciples which resulted from the Geneva meeting on\r\n8 September. The United States of America deserves\r\npraise for its persistent efforts in this regard. It is vitally\r\nimportant that the members of the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the contact group countries,\r\ncontinue their common approach to the solution of the\r\ncrisis. In this context, the United Nations and the\r\nEuropean Union mediators can make a valuable\r\ncontribution.\r\nThe success of the mediation efforts depends entirely\r\non the readiness of the parties to compromise. We\r\nstrongly urge all the parties to show flexibility and\r\nrestraint, and to refrain from attempting to obtain further\r\nadvantages on the battlefield. Special attention must be\r\ngiven to displaced persons, who, whenever possible, must\r\nbe allowed to repossess their homes.\r\nThe time has come to start reflecting on the\r\nreconstruction of that war-devastated region. This will\r\nrequire a sustained international effort. The United\r\nNations system together with the European Union and\r\nothers must play a leadership role in coordinating\r\nprograms in various fields, such as economic\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nreconstruction, humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees,\r\ndemocracy-building and human rights. Local leaders have\r\na heavy responsibility to prevent a new arms race, human\r\nrights abuses and the renewal of tensions in the area.\r\nNorway will continue to support the process of building\r\npeace and prosperity in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nI call on the General Assembly to lend its full and\r\nundivided support to the peace process in the Middle East.\r\nThe new interim agreement is a significant and necessary\r\nfollow-up to the Oslo agreement. Today we salute once\r\nmore the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders for their\r\ncourage and determination. As Chairman of the Ad Hoc\r\nLiaison Committee to coordinate donor activities, I strongly\r\nurge the donors to continue to support — for some donors,\r\nto increase their support of — the Middle East peace\r\nprocess by providing economic assistance to the Palestinian\r\npeople. Our common interest in peace in the Middle East\r\nis the best argument for heavy economic support to the\r\nPalestinian areas.\r\nNuclear testing is a threat to our search for common\r\nsecurity and to the environment, and should be banned. We\r\ndeeply deplore the Chinese and French tests, which we fear\r\nmay complicate the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a\r\ncomprehensive test ban treaty. We would once again urge\r\nall nuclear-weapon States to refrain from further nuclear\r\ntesting during the negotiations and until the treaty enters\r\ninto force.\r\nLand-mines are among the most insidious weapons in\r\ncommon use. They cause indiscriminate and widespread\r\nsuffering and continue to spread terror for years or even\r\ndecades after hostilities have ended. We call for a total ban\r\non the production, stockpiling, trade and use of\r\nanti-personnel land-mines. In the absence of such a ban, we\r\nurge all countries to adhere to the United Nations 1980\r\ninhumane-weapons Convention. No strengthening of the\r\nland-mine Protocol will be effective unless adherence to it\r\nbecomes universal.\r\nFinally, let us seize the opportunity offered by the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to renew our\r\nsupport for the United Nations and its aims. Each and every\r\none of us must help to ensure that the United Nations\r\nbecomes what we need and what future generations have\r\nthe right to expect: an effective tool to harness our strength\r\nand unite us in maintaining peace, promoting social\r\nprogress and protecting human dignity.\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Angola, His Excellency Mr. Venancio de Moura.\r\nMr. De Moura (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Permit me at\r\nthe outset, Sir, on behalf of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Angola and of my entire delegation that is\r\naccompanying me, to express my satisfaction at your\r\nelection to the presidency of this session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations. We are convinced that\r\nyour excellent personal qualities and the diplomatic skill\r\nyou have accumulated will guarantee the success of the\r\nconduct of the work of this significant session. Your\r\nelection is also well-deserved recognition of the important\r\ncontribution which your country has made to the\r\npromotion of peace and international security. I assure\r\nyou, at this stage, of the cooperation of my delegation.\r\nWe commit ourselves to doing everything to support this\r\narduous but honourable task with humility and a sense of\r\nresponsibility.\r\nI cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing\r\nmy appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Amara\r\nEssy, for the dedication and interest with which he carried\r\nout the activities of the Assembly during his mandate.\r\nSimilarly, I address my remarks to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has tenaciously done\r\neverything, to find the very best solutions for the\r\nproblems afflicting humanity, pledging to provide our\r\nOrganization with the dynamism needed to face future\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe fiftieth session of the General Assembly, which\r\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of\r\nthe United Nations, provides us with an opportunity to\r\nengage in profound reflection on the extent to which we\r\nhave moved forward towards the realization of its main\r\ngoals, inter alia, preservation of international peace and\r\nsecurity, promotion and protection of human rights, and\r\neconomic and social development, with a view to looking\r\nmore optimistically and more boldly at the challenges\r\nwhich lie ahead on the eve of the twenty-first century.\r\nIn fact, although the changes that took place in the\r\nwake of the cold war led to a certain easing in\r\ninternational relations and promoted, as never before,\r\ndemocratic values, the international situation nevertheless\r\nhas continued to deteriorate in recent times in the\r\npolitical, economic, social and financial spheres. Conflicts\r\nof all sorts proliferate, affecting principally the countries\r\nof the so-called third world and creating a climate of\r\nuncertainty as to the future of humankind.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, we face\r\nnew and greater challenges that will necessitate joint,\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nconcerted action by the Members of the United Nations.\r\nThis will require a new democratic structure in international\r\nrelations, in the broadest sense.\r\nMore than ever before, we need to think about the\r\nobjectives and role of the United Nations, as set out in the\r\nCharter, and focus on that task.\r\nThe process of restructuring the United Nations should\r\nlead the Organization to an arrangement that reflects the\r\nnew challenges we face in the world at this time and that\r\nwould allow for the broad participation of its Members. We\r\nare convinced that the present structure of the United\r\nNations — and in particular that of the Security Council —\r\ndoes not meet the present needs of post-cold-war\r\ninternational relations. Apart from the restructuring\r\nundertaken in the agencies that coordinate economic and\r\nsocial development worldwide, priority should be given to\r\nthe restructuring of the Security Council, whose\r\ncomposition continues to be a reflection of the cold war.\r\nThe enlargement of the Council should take place with\r\nrespect to the categories of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers alike. This will require taking into consideration\r\nthe need for geographic balance.\r\nWe are also in favour of restructuring the methods of\r\nwork of the United Nations so as to make them more\r\ntransparent.\r\nFurthermore, it is important to guarantee the\r\neffectiveness of the mechanisms and means of ensuring\r\nimplementation of the decisions of United Nations organs.\r\nIn recent years, the General Assembly has adopted\r\nnumerous resolutions, and important global strategies have\r\nbeen defined in various forums under the aegis of the\r\nUnited Nations, aimed at solving problems afflicting all\r\nhumankind. These problems range from the living\r\nconditions of children, the environment, human rights,\r\npopulation problems and social development to, more\r\nrecently, the issue of the situation of women, dealt with at\r\nthe Beijing Conference.\r\nThe time has come to take action. The unsatisfactory\r\nfunctioning of some of the mechanisms for monitoring the\r\napplication of decisions and the weak commitment of States\r\nhave been the root cause of the failure to carry out many of\r\nthese recommendations.\r\nThe world socio-economic situation continues to\r\ndeteriorate, particularly in the so-called developing\r\ncountries, where many economies are on the verge of\r\ncollapse.\r\nPublic assistance for development has sunk to\r\ndeplorable levels. United Nations agencies involved in\r\ndevelopment have seen their budgets severely affected by\r\nthe financial crisis, resulting in cuts in numerous\r\nprogrammes that were destined to help raise development\r\nindicators in various countries. To give just one example,\r\nthe annual report of the Secretary-General indicates that\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme experienced\r\na reduction of $1.4 billion in the period 1992-1996.\r\nStructural adjustment programmes undertaken in\r\nvarious countries have not produced the desired results,\r\nleading to reductions in national funds in the social field.\r\nThese negative factors are cumulative, and added to them\r\nis the heavy burden of external debt, whose service alone\r\nconsumes a large part of the gross national product of\r\ndebtor countries.\r\nAfrica’s capacity to repay debt has been negatively\r\naffected not only by weak economic structures inherited\r\nfrom the past, but also by natural disasters and internal\r\narmed conflicts. In view of this situation, it is necessary\r\nto adopt measures that are more just and less prejudicial,\r\nso that debtor countries can pay their external debt\r\nwithout hindering their development or requiring further\r\nsacrifices on the part of the poorest segments of their\r\npopulations.\r\nThe principal international financial institutions\r\nshould grant more favourable credit to developing\r\ncountries, so that the remedies applied to their respective\r\neconomies will not lead to a deterioration of the health of\r\nthose economies.\r\nThe present international economic order does not\r\nfavour the economies of the so-called third world. It is\r\nthus necessary to have a more just international economic\r\norder, without protectionist measures that impede\r\ninternational business relations and create discrimination\r\nagainst developing countries, the majority of which\r\nbecome sources of raw materials and inexpensive labour\r\nand importers of manufactured goods.\r\nThe strengthening of south-south cooperation and\r\nregional economic integration will, as we see it, be an\r\nadequate response to this trend. Countries of the southern\r\nregion of Africa, to which Angola belongs, have provided\r\na good example of regional integration, both economic\r\nand political, by forming the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC). Given the prospects\r\nfor total political stability in the region and its economic\r\npotential, the region may well transform itself into an\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nimportant development zone. In the same way we value the\r\njoint regional integration between members of the Zone of\r\nPeace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, of which\r\nAngola is also a member.\r\nIn successive resolutions the General Assembly has\r\nrecommended that priority be given to our continent in\r\nterms of aid for development, because it is the region of the\r\nworld that has most suffered the tragic effects of\r\ncolonialism. But reality shows a significant drop in\r\nresources available for development. This aggravates the\r\nprecarious economic situation of African countries that have\r\nno capital and no technology, which increases poverty and\r\nmakes them susceptible to serious internal conflict.\r\nIf, as we have just indicated, it is true that we are\r\nwitnessing, nearly everywhere, some proliferation of\r\nregional conflicts that put peace and international security\r\nat risk, it is also true that in Africa these conflicts have\r\nreached a level of great danger. Not only is the dimension\r\nof such conflicts a source of concern but so is their nature.\r\nIts markedly ethnic, racial or religious character is being\r\nused to justify intentions which place at risk the unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of several nations.\r\nThe inadmissible genocide that occurred in Rwanda\r\nseriously damaged the values of human dignity and\r\ntolerance. Above all, it demonstrated the need for the\r\ninternational community to seek new ways and means to\r\neliminate the focal points of conflict and to guarantee\r\nprotection for civilian populations, the people who are the\r\nprimary victims of internal conflicts.\r\nIn Burundi we are concerned about the deteriorating\r\ninternal situation. In this connection the international\r\ncommunity, and the United Nations in particular, should\r\nshoulder their responsibilities in order to help avoid the\r\nrepetition in that country of earlier events by supporting by\r\nevery means available the efforts carried out by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) mission with a view\r\nto fostering peace and stability.\r\nIn Somalia the continuing fratricidal war that is tearing\r\nthat society apart is threatening the very existence and\r\nintegrity of the country. The international community, and\r\nthe United Nations in particular, cannot and should not fail\r\nto shoulder its responsibilities vis-à-vis the people of\r\nSomalia.\r\nWe pay tribute to Liberia for the recent developments\r\nin that country, thanks to the recent Abuja peace agreement\r\nbetween the warring parties. We hope that this agreement\r\nwill finally bring lasting peace to the Liberian people.\r\nConcerning Western Sahara, we join our voice to the\r\nvoice of the international community in urging the\r\ninterested parties to observe the United Nations peace\r\nplan.\r\nDespite its own internal difficulties, the Government\r\nof the Republic of Angola is doing its utmost to support\r\nOAU efforts within the framework of African\r\nmechanisms of prevention, management and resolution of\r\nconflicts. In that context we did not hesitate to make a\r\ncontribution to a resolution of the crisis faced by the\r\npeople of the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe after\r\nthe coup d’état of 15 August. As the Assembly will be\r\naware, Angolan mediation helped to restore democratic\r\ninstitutions and constitutional order in that country. We\r\nhave acted on behalf of the historic solidarity which links\r\nour two peoples in a common struggle for democratic\r\nliberties and respect for the law of constitutional\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThanks to the support provided by the international\r\ncommunity, particularly the Portuguese-speaking\r\ncountries, along with the European Union, France and\r\nPortugal in particular, and of course the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations, we were able, in a short period of\r\ntime, to get an agreement between the parties on 22\r\nAugust last.\r\nThe conflict in the countries of the former\r\nYugoslavia is one of the most complex conflicts seen in\r\nEurope since the end of the cold war. The Government of\r\nAngola is concerned about this conflict. We support the\r\ncurrent peace initiatives and hope that the meeting\r\nbetween the parties involved and the mediators will lead\r\nto concrete results, to the satisfaction of the peoples of\r\nthe region.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East has been marked by\r\nsome important and significant developments since the\r\nsigning of the agreement between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the beginning of the\r\nnormalization of bilateral relations among countries of the\r\nregion.\r\nSuch advances are quite encouraging. We are\r\nconfident of a final end to the Arab-Israeli conflict if we\r\ncontinue to see political will, a constructive spirit and\r\nflexibility demonstrated on all sides. Angola has always\r\ndefended the right to self-determination of the people of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nPalestine and the restitution of the occupied Arab territories.\r\nWe here reiterate our support for the peace process that is\r\nunder way and express our opposition to acts of violence\r\nintended to call into question the continuation of this\r\nprocess.\r\nThe question of East Timor continues to prick the\r\nconscience of the international community. It is necessary\r\nto ensure that the people of East Timor enjoy the legitimate\r\nright freely to choose its own destiny and that this be\r\nrecognized. In this regard the United Nations has an\r\nimportant responsibility, which it cannot escape.\r\nWe are particularly encouraged by the opening of a\r\ndialogue between Portugal and Indonesia. But there will be\r\npositive results only if the interests and options of the\r\npeople of the Territory are borne in mind during the search\r\nfor a just and acceptable solution.\r\nAngola shares with the people of East Timor a\r\ncommon past of struggle against Portuguese colonialism.\r\nWe will continue to give our utmost to the search for a just\r\nand acceptable solution.\r\nBy sustaining an economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo against Cuba for more than 30 years the United\r\nStates of America has created a paradox within the reality\r\nof our times. The embargo is a set-back to international\r\nefforts to eliminate the last relics of the cold war. Angola\r\ntherefore reiterates its opposition to this unilateral measure,\r\nwhose extraterritorial impact is in violation of international\r\nnorms of free trade and international law.\r\nPractice shows that constructive dialogue is the best\r\nsolution for resolving differences, similar to that which\r\noccurred in reaching a solution to the problem of migration\r\nbetween the two countries. We think that it is up to the\r\npeople of Cuba freely to decide their own destiny.\r\nObviously, I cannot refrain from making reference to\r\nthe situation in my own country, which will be of interest\r\nto many here. As is known, after long years of war Angola\r\nfinally found the path to peace, starting with the signature\r\nof the Lusaka Protocol and the initial steps taken to\r\nimplement its provisions. It is an agreement that\r\ncomplements the fundamental structure of the peace process\r\nestablished by the Bicesse Accords, which were signed with\r\nthe mediation of the Government of Portugal.\r\nSince the signature of the Lusaka document in 1991\r\nand the cease-fire agreed to in November last year, the\r\nsituation in our country has evolved significantly, despite\r\nsome negative aspects and obstacles that I shall mention\r\nshortly. Major offensive military actions have stopped,\r\nleading to the free movement of people and goods in\r\nmany areas of the country under Government control. We\r\nare now seeing the return of thousands of displaced\r\ncitizens to their areas of origin.\r\nIn the political area, a direct dialogue has begun\r\nbetween the Government and UNITA, between His\r\nExcellency the President of Angola and Mr. Savimbi.\r\nThis has facilitated the resolution of many problems\r\nrelated to the implementation of the Accords that were\r\nnot resolved at Lusaka.\r\nIn addition, the Government has taken important\r\nsteps to strengthen the climate of mutual trust and to\r\nmake reconciliation possible. Within this context, the\r\nGovernment supported a legislative initiative to modify\r\nthe Constitution to accommodate the leader of UNITA as\r\none of the two Vice-Presidents of the Republic. That\r\nsignificant political gesture, along with the future\r\nintegration of UNITA members in a government of\r\nnational unity, will create conditions for Angolans to\r\nenjoy a definitive and lasting peace in a climate of\r\ntolerance, free from hatreds or resentment.\r\nDespite those efforts, which my Government views\r\nas positive, we continue to be concerned by the excessive\r\ndelays in the implementation of the peace process, whose\r\nmost serious issue is the quartering and demobilization of\r\nUNITA forces, which has not yet been implemented as it\r\nshould have been under the Lusaka Accords. This delay\r\nhas resulted in some serious recent problems and\r\nincidents in some regions of the country. Such incidents\r\ndo not at this time pose a serious threat to peace, but they\r\nare capable of creating dangerous focal points of tension\r\nthat call into question the trust that is needed for full\r\nimplementation of the Peace Accords.\r\nMy Government would like to take this opportunity\r\nto express its gratitude for the work done by the United\r\nNations Observer Mission in Angola. It has by and large\r\nassured respect for the provisions of the Peace Accords\r\nand has involved the presence of many countries\r\nrepresented here. We believe that the complete\r\ndeployment of peace-keeping infantry units will make it\r\npossible better to control the implementation of the\r\ncommitments made in Lusaka.\r\nThe post-conflict phase in Angola will require urgent\r\nmeasures of a special economic and social nature in order\r\nto move the country rapidly out of the state of crisis, to\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nrebuild its productive and social infrastructures and to\r\nprevent a return to war, measures which must guarantee the\r\nsocial reintegration of thousands of military personnel, of\r\nwhom some 150,000 are to be demobilized, and the return\r\nof refugees and internally displaced persons who are\r\nreturning to their areas of origin.\r\nAs I speak, a meeting is being held in Brussels\r\nbetween my country and the European Community to come\r\nup with an overall plan for national reconciliation. From\r\nthis rostrum we should like to express our thanks to all\r\ncountries that have assisted us and to all the United Nations\r\nagencies that have made it possible to organize this\r\nimportant meeting, the first round table meeting in Brussels.\r\nMy Government has entered in earnest on to the task of\r\nachieving national reconciliation in our country. As we said\r\nearlier, a community rehabilitation programme has been\r\ncreated, in collaboration with the United Nations, to this\r\nend. It has a budget of $700 million that will be open to all\r\ndonor countries in Brussels with a view, inter alia, to\r\nrestoring in the shortest possible time basic production\r\nactivity in the 18 provinces of the country.\r\nWe are aware that the rapid recovery of the Angolan\r\neconomy will depend largely on our success in\r\nimplementing this programme and achieving peace and\r\nharmony in our country. It is an economy that saw its gross\r\nnational product and per capita income decrease by one half\r\nas a consequence of war. Thus, we would like once again\r\nto request the international community to continue to lend\r\nassistance to Angola in order to achieve complete peace and\r\nreconciliation among all Angolans. We hope that can\r\nbecome a reality.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and External Trade of Iceland, His Excellency Mr.\r\nHalldór Asgrímsson.\r\nMr. Asgrímsson (Iceland): Mr. President, may I\r\ncongratulate you on your election and express my deep\r\nsatisfaction at seeing a representative of Portugal, an ally\r\nand a valued member of the international community,\r\noccupy the presidency of the General Assembly in our\r\nfiftieth anniversary year.\r\nAnniversaries are occasions to celebrate past\r\naccomplishments. The towering achievement of the United\r\nNations is to have survived through nearly half a century\r\nwhere power relationships often submerged the high-minded\r\nvision of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, as we\r\ncelebrate the half-century of our Organization, we also\r\ncelebrate the triumph of hope over despair and of good\r\nfaith over cynicism. At long last, there is an opportunity\r\nfor the United Nations to come into its own and for the\r\nideals of the Charter to take hold.\r\nAt the same time, we must learn from our mistakes.\r\nForemost, in that context, is the tragic conflict in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. In spite of the laudable humanitarian\r\nand peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization has in the eyes of the world appeared\r\nincapable of preventing the savage dismembering of a\r\nsovereign Member State.\r\nAlthough we all realize that the United Nations can\r\nnever provide foolproof insurance against evil and\r\ninjustice, the Organization must in the future face such\r\nchallenges in a more resolute manner. We must demand\r\nmore of ourselves and learn how to use more effectively\r\nthe indispensable machinery the Organization has to offer.\r\nWe should also bear in mind that no organization,\r\nhowever efficient, can provide a substitute for the political\r\nwill of its Member States.\r\nRecent setbacks should, however, not be allowed to\r\nobscure the considerable gains, global and regional, that\r\nhave been made on a number of fronts over the past year.\r\nLet me mention only a few.\r\nThe march of democracy has continued through the\r\norganization of free elections in different parts of the\r\nworld, and a growing number of people now live under\r\npluralistic and democratic Governments. In recent years,\r\nthe Organization has contributed to the success of\r\nelections in various Member States.\r\nTwo major United Nations Conferences took place\r\nearlier this year. Each could, if followed up in earnest,\r\nmake a tangible difference in the lives of people\r\neverywhere. At the World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen in March, we decided to\r\nplace people at the centre of development and to address\r\nthe problem of global poverty more effectively. At the\r\nrecently concluded Fourth World Conference on Women\r\nin Beijing, we pledged to empower women and to involve\r\nthem as equal partners in all spheres of society. Together,\r\nwomen and men can and should create a powerful unity\r\nbased on equality, development and peace.\r\nIn the area of international law, the achievements of\r\nthe United Nations were once again brought into focus\r\nwith the entry into force of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea last November and the\r\nadoption in August of the Agreement on the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the Convention relating\r\nto the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\r\nIn May, a historic step was taken towards ridding the\r\nworld of the threat of nuclear weapons. The decision by the\r\nParties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to extend\r\nthe Treaty indefinitely and without conditions should pave\r\nthe way for a comprehensive and verifiable test ban and an\r\nagreement to cut off the production of fissile material. It is\r\nregrettable that China and France have not heeded the\r\nworldwide demand for a moratorium on nuclear testing.\r\nAt the regional level there have also been welcome\r\ndevelopments. While the passage has not been smooth,\r\nthere has been further progress towards a comprehensive\r\npeace in the Middle East. We have witnessed the joint\r\nefforts of the Israelis and the Palestinians to bring their\r\nconflict to an end, and we extend to them our sincere\r\ncongratulations on their historic agreement to be signed\r\nlater this week.\r\nThese are substantial accomplishments. They confirm\r\nthat hard work, guided by the goals and ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations, can bear fruit. More of that same\r\ndedication is now required as the Organization prepares to\r\ntake on the complex challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe foremost challenge is the need to establish and\r\nsafeguard peace. While the threat of nuclear holocaust has\r\nreceded, we still live in a world riven by wars. Annual\r\nmilitary expenditure still nearly equals the total income of\r\nthe poorer half of the world’s population. The peace\r\ndividend we had hoped for in the aftermath of the cold war\r\nremains for many a sight unseen.\r\nThe Secretary-General has rightly observed that there\r\nis an inherent link between peace and development.\r\nWithout the one you cannot have the other. Peace is the\r\nnecessary precondition for the well-being of all peoples,\r\nand in the long run we shall be able to protect ourselves\r\nfrom the scourge of war only if we make the necessary\r\ninvestment in the infrastructure of peace. This involves,\r\namong other things, dealing with the legacy of deprivation\r\nthat still confronts mankind.\r\nThe challenge of development will not lend itself to a\r\nsimple formulation in terms of government versus the\r\nmarket-place. Instead, we must apply a comprehensive\r\nframework, linking democracy, society, the economy and\r\nthe environment, carefully nuanced to regional and local\r\ncircumstances. Here, the Secretary-General has led the way\r\nin his ground-breaking report. Let me dwell on a few\r\naspects of the issue of development that are of particular\r\ninterest to my own country.\r\nFirst a word on the role of democracy. Democracies,\r\nit is sometimes said, do not make wars. By promoting\r\ndemocracy we also foster peace. This is in part because\r\ntwo of the main pillars of democracy are tolerance and\r\nrespect for the customs, traditions and opinions of others.\r\nBut tolerance and respect for diversity must not be\r\nmisinterpreted. We live in a world of rich cultural\r\ndiversity, which we should relish and protect. However,\r\nmulticulturalism should never be used as a pretext for\r\ncompromising basic and universal human rights.\r\nIceland attaches continued importance to\r\ninternational efforts to create a global environment\r\nconducive to job-led economic growth. But economic\r\ngrowth must never be our sole objective, without regard\r\nto human values.\r\nEnvironmental protection is another main concern.\r\nImportant strides have been made in this area since the\r\nEarth Summit in Rio. Climate change and ozone\r\ndepletion, two major dangers to the global ecosystem, are\r\nnow being dealt with on the basis of legally binding\r\nconventions. But much will depend on coordinated action\r\nto implement the commitments we have undertaken.\r\nFurthermore, greater attention needs to be devoted to the\r\nmarine environment.\r\nPollution of the marine environment, if not\r\ncontained, can have a serious impact on human\r\nsettlements in certain regions of the world, not least\r\ncommunities of indigenous peoples. In this connection,\r\nchemical pollutants in the form of persistent organic\r\nsubstances are of particular concern for entire societies\r\nwhich base their livelihood on the living resources of the\r\nsea.\r\nIceland is firmly of the view that this threat can be\r\ncountered only through a global and legally binding\r\nframework similar to that governing climate change and\r\nozone depletion. For this reason, my Government attaches\r\nparticular importance to the conference on the protection\r\nof the marine environment from land-based sources, due\r\nto take place in Washington later this year, and we urge\r\nMember States to take active part in this conference.\r\nMarine living resources can make an important\r\ncontribution to food security in a world faced with rapid\r\npopulation growth. Such resources provide food and\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nlivelihood to millions of people and, if sustainably used,\r\noffer increased potential to meet nutritional and social\r\nneeds, particularly in the developing countries, as noted in\r\na recent report of the Food and Agriculture Organization.\r\nFor this reason, it is particularly regrettable that close\r\nto 70 per cent of the world’s conventional species of fish\r\nwere, according to the same agency, fully exploited,\r\noverexploited or depleted, or are in the process of\r\nrebuilding as a result of depletion in the early 1990s.\r\nClearly, the ability to satisfy global demand for food from\r\nthe sea in the coming years will depend to no small extent\r\non the adoption of responsible fisheries conservation and\r\nmanagement policies. We should at all times view the\r\necosystem of the oceans as a whole and harvest all species\r\nof this vast but delicate resource in a sustainable manner.\r\nLooked at in this light, the results of the United\r\nNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, while by no means the final word\r\non this matter, acquire major significance. Let me point out\r\nthat the law of the sea has been the sphere in which Iceland\r\nhas been most engaged, beginning in 1949, when, upon a\r\nproposal by Iceland, the International Law Commission was\r\ngiven the task of studying all aspects of the law of the sea.\r\nIceland will continue to be active in the implementation of\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nWe live in an era of growing demand on diminishing\r\nnatural resources. It is therefore to be welcomed that\r\ninternational cooperation is now gradually extending to the\r\nArctic region, breaking at last through the barrier of what\r\nthe Icelandic- American explorer Vilhjálmur Stefánsson\r\nonce referred to as\r\n“the ancient inherited opinions about the terrors of the\r\nFrozen North”, a “lifeless waste of eternal silence”.\r\nThe resources of the Arctic are enormous. The nations of\r\nthe region should develop its potential and work together in\r\nthe economic, environmental and cultural fields. Therefore,\r\nmy Government attaches the highest importance to the\r\nconsultations that have taken place among the Governments\r\nof the eight Arctic States to establish the Arctic Council.\r\nWe have had intensive discussions on changes in the\r\nSecurity Council, including on whether to increase its\r\nmembership. Iceland is of the view that the fundamental\r\nobjective of an enlargement of the Council should be to\r\nstrengthen its capacity to discharge the duties assigned to it.\r\nWe believe that there should be an increase in the number\r\nof both permanent and non-permanent members. In this\r\ncontext, I would like to express my Government’s support\r\nfor the permanent membership of Germany and Japan in\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nReform, however, will avail us little if we fail to\r\ncome to grips with the serious financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations. Here, I fully share the deep concerns that\r\nthe Secretary-General has expressed in his comprehensive\r\nreport on the state of the Organization. According to their\r\nobligations under the Charter, the Member States should\r\npay their contributions to the regular budget in full, on\r\ntime and without condition. If all Member States do not\r\nlive up to their obligations, we will be forced to take the\r\ninevitable political decision to scale back the activities of\r\nthe Organization. At a time when the services of the\r\nUnited Nations are in greater demand and when the\r\nOrganization has a better chance of success than ever\r\nbefore, such a step would be highly unfortunate. Instead,\r\nlet us put the fiftieth anniversary to good use and make\r\nthe earnest pledge to put the Organization on a sound\r\nfinancial footing.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Nicaragua, His Excellency Mr. Ernesto\r\nLeal.\r\nMr. Leal (Nicaragua) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIt is a pleasure for me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly on\r\nthis, the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. I also\r\nwish to extend our recognition to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Amara Essy.\r\nWe are convinced that one of the most important\r\nitems of this session must be support for the effective and\r\nsubstantive reform of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Camacho Omiste (Bolivia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe only way to approach the construction of a new\r\ninternational order is by renewing our faith in\r\nmultilateralism and giving the United Nations its central,\r\nindispensable role in the search for lasting solutions to the\r\ncomplex problems that all our societies are experiencing.\r\nHalf a century has passed since the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations. With its successes and setbacks, its\r\naccomplishments and its problems, the United Nations has\r\nshown that only organized international cooperation will\r\nmake it possible to prevent new conflicts. It is impossible\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nto imagine today’s world without this universal institution.\r\nThe profound changes that have taken place since that era\r\nand the demands of the future make it necessary for the\r\nUnited Nations to be renewed, revitalized, reformed and\r\nstrengthened.\r\nIt is valid, then, for us to ask ourselves what the new\r\nvision of our United Nations is in a changing, global and\r\ninterdependent world. The transformation of the United\r\nNations cannot be separated from the profound\r\ntransformations that democracy itself is undergoing\r\nthroughout the world. Our Organization must be reformed\r\non the basis of the new conception of democracy.\r\nThe concept of democracy in the world has changed.\r\nDemocracy is no longer a static concept, nor is it limited\r\nonly to the internal affairs of States. Democracy is a\r\npatrimony of values that are common to all humankind.\r\nToday’s democracy is dynamic, and in order for it to take\r\non a profound character, it should be understood as an\r\nunfinished work that is always in transition.\r\nToday I should like to emphasize various aspects of\r\nthis international democratic transition, which is closely\r\nrelated to the transition that our Organization must undergo.\r\nFirst, we are moving away from the political agenda\r\nand moving towards the social agenda. The World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, held in Denmark, reminded us that\r\nthe ultimate objective of all our efforts is to improve the\r\nliving conditions and quality of life of our peoples. Our\r\nOrganization was born in the geopolitical era, marked by\r\nEast-West confrontation and bipolar division. Today we are\r\npassing towards a world divided into economic blocs where\r\nsocial policies are demanding their rightful place at centre\r\nstage.\r\nOur Organization has the duty to facilitate this\r\ntransition from a world divided between military Powers to\r\na world where democracy, economic efficiency and social\r\njustice crown a new world order.\r\nSecondly, democracy is passing from centralized\r\ndecision-making to broad participation by citizens in\r\nsociety. In this way we are moving from formal democracy\r\nto participative democracy, where power and choice are\r\nsomehow returned to communities. This transition means\r\nmore opportunity for dialogue and internal consensus within\r\nour societies. As has been said on other occasions, the\r\nconcept of international peace gives way to the concept of\r\ninternal peace within our States. Last year the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself said, at the luncheon he gave for Heads of\r\nState, that wars are no longer waged between States but,\r\nrather, within our nations. That is why it is so important\r\nto promote reconciliation and negotiation in divided\r\nsocieties.\r\nThirdly, we are moving from bureaucracy to good\r\ngovernment. This transition requires that special attention\r\nbe given to the reform and modernization of the State.\r\nEfficiency and effectiveness should now be the new terms\r\nfor public administration.\r\nFourthly, we are passing from the unilateral\r\nperspective that has characterized the world to a focus on\r\ngender that opens the doors for the full, active\r\nparticipation of women in the great tasks of our times.\r\nEquality and equity between men and women is a basic\r\nprinciple for achieving the true development of\r\ninternational society. In this regard, the recent Conference\r\nin Beijing opened up a new chapter for us, leading\r\ntowards this new goal.\r\nOur Organization also has to assimilate the transition\r\nfrom a partial concept of development to an integrated\r\nconcept of sustainable development. This new concept\r\nrequires us to combine the political dimension with the\r\nsocial, cultural, economic, ecological and even ethnic\r\ndimensions of development processes.\r\nCentral America, a region that emerged into\r\ndemocracy from out of the ashes of war and conflict —\r\na region, as the President of El Salvador, Mr. Armando\r\nCalderón Sol, said this afternoon, is going through a new\r\nstage in its history — has also adopted a new model of\r\nsustainable development that makes ours the first region\r\nin the world to try, through the concrete fulfilment of\r\ncommitments in all areas, to make a reality of the\r\nagreements of the Rio Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWe Central Americans are moving from the model\r\nof military security centred on the cold-war poles of\r\npower to the new model of democratic security. The\r\nUnited Nations should therefore lead the way in this new\r\nconcept of security, which is not limited to the military\r\naspect. Rather, human security should be the new axis of\r\nthis new model of world security.\r\nToday we Central Americans are discussing a treaty\r\non democratic security, developed by Nicaragua, that\r\nenshrines this new concept of security, which is no longer\r\nbased on number and quality of weapons, but, rather, on\r\nthe quality of human life, the efficiency of democratic\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ninstitutions, civil security, the fight against drug trafficking,\r\nterrorism and arms trafficking and cooperation in all areas.\r\nWe Central Americans have concluded that democracy and\r\nits improvement are the best way to strengthen regional\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe must be aware that we are also going through a\r\ntransition to what we call preventive democracy. By this we\r\nmean that we should strive to anticipate conflicts and their\r\ncauses in order not to have to resolve them later with the\r\npeace-keeping forces of this Organization. That is why we\r\nhave always said that the best peace-keeping operation is\r\nthe one that we can avoid, that we never have to carry out.\r\nThis also means rechannelling efforts into the area of\r\npromoting human rights — no longer treating this subject\r\nas a mere list of violations of fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms devoting great efforts to the promotion of respect\r\nfor those rights and human freedoms.\r\nIn its reform process, our Organization should also\r\ntake into account that commerce and investment are ceasing\r\nto be merely economic factors; they are becoming a\r\ngenuine element of support for those democratic processes\r\nthat demand to form part of economic development. The\r\nbattles waged before on the battlefield are now waged in\r\ninternational markets. What we must understand is that\r\nthere, too, a battle for the sustainability, progress and\r\ndevelopment of democracy is taking place.\r\nWe are also making the transition from a world\r\ndivided between opulence and poverty to one with a new\r\nfocus on establishing a real alliance for development\r\nbetween the countries of the north and the countries of the\r\nsouth. The era of confrontation should give way to a new\r\nera of cooperation directed at reducing the inequalities\r\nbetween a rich and prosperous north and a dispossessed and\r\npoor south.\r\nWe need to make the transition from an era of\r\ninequality of opportunities to an era of democratization of\r\ndevelopment. By this I mean, at the internal level,\r\nbroadening the base of the benefits of progress for a\r\nsteadily growing number of small and medium-sized\r\nbusinessmen. At the international level democratization of\r\ndevelopment implies sharing the benefits of progress in a\r\nmore equitable manner between countries.\r\nIt is not possible to make a deep revision of the\r\nstructure of our Organization without looking at the\r\nprofound changes that have taken place in the world and\r\nwhich are enriching and broadening many of our values,\r\nconcepts and goals while presenting new challenges.\r\nFor this reason it is very important to see that the\r\nreform of the United Nations rests on this global renewal\r\nof democracy, whose consolidation constitutes the\r\nfundamental political priority for the new world order we\r\nare all building.\r\nI would like to emphasize here that the new and\r\nrestored democracies, which met in Managua in 1994,\r\nhave much to do with and much to say about the future\r\nand the values of our Organization. The consolidation of\r\ndemocracy in the societies that lived through the\r\ntotalitarian doctrines of this century is fundamental to\r\nsustaining this new vision of the United Nations.\r\nMy country has always counted on the invaluable\r\ncooperation of the United Nations to complete a transition\r\nprocess characterized by its complexity. The United\r\nNations has accompanied us on our road from a\r\nNicaragua at war to a Nicaragua at peace; from a\r\nNicaragua divided and without democratic institutions to\r\na new Nicaragua that today enjoys complete freedom. The\r\nsame United Nations is accompanying us in the process\r\nof strengthening the advances made, with the benefits of\r\neconomic development.\r\nI would like to recall with special gratitude the\r\nvarious resolutions of this General Assembly, requesting\r\nMember States and international financial institutions to\r\ncontinue to lend their support to Nicaragua in a wider and\r\nmore flexible manner, taking into consideration the\r\nexceptional circumstances of our country.\r\nNicaragua now faces the challenge of successfully\r\nending the first stage of its transition process, giving\r\nspecial attention to overcoming dire poverty, to the\r\nmodernization of its institutions and to the improvement\r\nof its productive capacity. Nicaragua is preparing to hold\r\nits next elections in 1996, thus taking a new step in the\r\nconsolidation of its democratic institutions. It is worth\r\nrecalling that six years ago this Organization, for the first\r\ntime in its history, participated in observing elections, and\r\nthat happened in Nicaragua. Today I want to invite the\r\nUnited Nations to participate as an observer again, in\r\nthese new elections which will mark a transcendental\r\nstage in our democratic process.\r\nThese challenges make indispensable our continuing\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations system and with\r\nfriendly countries in establishing once and for all strong\r\nfoundations for economic and social development and for\r\na lasting peace. The United Nations still has much to do\r\nin Nicaragua.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nI would like to refer now to the subject of the reform\r\nof this Organization. We need to move forward urgently in\r\nthe matter of the democratization of the United Nations and\r\nall its main organs. In this endeavour Nicaragua fully\r\nsupports an increase in the number of members of the\r\nSecurity Council, in order to ensure the equitable\r\nrepresentation of all regional groups, among the permanent\r\nmembers as well as the non-permanent. In this context, we\r\nsupport the entry of Germany and Japan, countries that we\r\nare certain will make a significant contribution to the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council.\r\nWe must redouble our efforts to promote\r\nadministrative and budgetary reforms that will make our\r\nOrganization more efficient. We consider it necessary to\r\ncontinue with the functional and organizational\r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, which\r\nshould maintain its role as the custodian of the economic,\r\nsocial and cultural rights of Member States.\r\nWe cannot speak of reforms in the United Nations\r\nwithout speaking of reforms in the General Assembly. The\r\nAssembly must be revitalized, and it should coordinate its\r\nactivities more closely with the other United Nations\r\norgans. The President of the Assembly should be given\r\nmore specific tasks, in accordance with the new\r\ncircumstances I have already mentioned.\r\nThere can be no reform of the United Nations without\r\na solution to the financial crisis through which the\r\nOrganization is passing. The continual budgetary problems\r\nmust be examined in an honest, pragmatic way, since the\r\ncredibility of the Organization is at stake.\r\nWe are convinced that the development programme\r\nwill be a strategy that is coherent, not only with the new\r\nvision of world development, but also with the goals and\r\nobjectives of the new or restored democracies. It is\r\nnecessary to have a creative programme for development,\r\nwith universal validity, which will combine assistance for\r\ndevelopment, trade, investments, the transfer of technology\r\nand a reasonable solution to the problem of the debt and the\r\nnegative transfer of resources.\r\nOne of the fundamental pillars of Nicaragua’s foreign\r\npolicy is general and complete disarmament, nuclear as well\r\nas conventional. Nicaragua is therefore concerned about the\r\nrecent nuclear tests in the Pacific.\r\nNicaragua is in solidarity with the 21 million\r\ninhabitants of the Republic of China in Taiwan, and in this\r\ncontext we call for resolution of the exceptional situation of\r\nthe Republic of China through peaceful means, in\r\naccordance with the principles of the peaceful resolution\r\nof disputes between States and within the framework of\r\nthe creation of an ad hoc committee of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nNicaragua takes the opportunity once more to salute\r\nthe courage and determination of the South African\r\npeople in the achievement of a new South Africa, united\r\nand non-racist.\r\nIn Mozambique we hope that the process of\r\nreconciliation will continue and that, finally, that patient\r\nbrother country will take the road to economic growth\r\nand development.\r\nSimilarly, we hope that Angola will consolidate the\r\nestablishment of a strong and lasting peace, indispensable\r\nfor national reconciliation and reconstruction.\r\nAs regards the Palestinian question and the Middle\r\nEast, we are pleased with the positive and irreversible\r\nevolution towards a just and lasting solution to the\r\nconflict. We warmly welcome the recent agreements\r\nbetween Israel and Palestine.\r\nOur country continues to be alarmed by the situation\r\nin Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda, and considers that\r\ngreater efforts are necessary on the part of the\r\ninternational community, and principally of the United\r\nNations, to bring stability and peace to those countries.\r\nIn Europe, in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nwe are worried about the continuation of hostilities and\r\nhope for a peaceful solution to the conflict. The\r\nNicaraguan Government greets with approval the Joint\r\nStatement and Agreed Basic Principles, signed recently by\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia.\r\nTo end, I wish to say that today more than ever, on\r\nthe occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, Nicaragua and the majority of the peoples of the\r\nworld put our confidence in our Organization, since we\r\nconsider that the time has come for the United Nations to\r\nassume fully its responsibilities under the Charter.\r\nNicaragua is ready, in its current conditions of peace and\r\nharmony, to support this new vision of the United\r\nNations, also based on a new vision of democracy.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nAffairs, National Security and Attorney-General of Belize,\r\nHis Excellency the Honourable Dean Barrow.\r\nMr. Barrow (Belize): There is, of course, a special\r\nresonance to the congratulations we offer the President on\r\nhis election to this high post at the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In this watershed year, his job will be\r\nparticularly challenging. The delegation of Belize pledges\r\nits fullest cooperation in helping to ensure the success of\r\nhis stewardship.\r\nAll the world is conscious of the historic significance\r\nof this fiftieth anniversary year. And a lot of work has gone\r\ninto the process leading up to this session. We also at this\r\njuncture, then, express our thanks to the President’s\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, and those\r\nwhose job it has been to supervise and implement the\r\npreparatory effort.\r\nIf this is a year of celebration, it is also a year of\r\nreckoning. Inevitably, the jubilee has concentrated attention\r\nas never before on our Organization. Can we withstand the\r\nscrutiny we provoke? Is our record one that, on balance,\r\nvindicates the vision of the founders? And in a world that\r\nis almost unrecognizably transformed since 1945, are we\r\nequipped for the changing role the United Nations must\r\nnow play?\r\nWell over 100 States have come into being since\r\n1945. The myriad issues that now dominate the global\r\nagenda are attended by a host of problems. The duties and\r\nburdens of the United Nations system have therefore\r\nproliferated hugely. Can the United Nations cope? And are\r\nwe, the Member States, prepared to invest our enterprise\r\nwith the resources necessary to deal with the new realities.\r\nThese, it seems, are the questions most urgently in\r\nneed of answers.\r\nIn thinking of the future, though, we would do well to\r\nlook at the past. And I would wish briefly now to examine\r\nour historical record, highlighting some issues of special\r\nrelevance to small countries such as Belize.\r\nJust four days ago, Belize celebrated the fourteenth\r\nanniversary of its independence. It was an independence\r\nlong delayed by the territorial claim of a neighbouring\r\ncountry. But it the end it was an independence made\r\npossible in no small measure by this Organization and its\r\nrole in world affairs.\r\nOne of the things that in the first place made our\r\naspiration for sovereignty realistic, was the seminal 1960\r\nGeneral Assembly Declaration on the Granting of\r\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. And the\r\nUnited Nations thereafter became our guiding star as we\r\nsteered our course between the Scylla of the historical\r\ncolonialism from which we were escaping and the\r\nCharybdis of the recolonization that was inherent in the\r\nterritorial claim.\r\nDuring the years of our independent existence, this\r\nOrganization has similarly continued to be a bedrock of\r\nour viability. The principles enshrined in the Charter, and\r\nthe international legal order derived from those principles,\r\nhave been a welcome guarantee of our sovereignty. The\r\nterritorial claim has not gone away. But the norms\r\nimposed by the United Nations, especially those requiring\r\npacific settlement of disputes among Member States, have\r\nat least helped to keep it from confounding our integrity.\r\nWho can doubt that, in one form or another, this\r\nsalutary experience of Belize with the United Nations has\r\nbeen replicated by any number of small countries?\r\nBecause of the multiplication of new States, especially\r\nsince 1960, the international order has been characterized\r\nby an unprecedented differentiation in underlying power\r\ncapabilities between the huge and the tiny. Very weak\r\nStates can, of course, never seriously hope to influence\r\ninternational behaviour solely through the use of their\r\nnational power capabilities. What the United Nations has\r\ndone for us, then, has been to offer a plenitude of\r\nsustenance via its many entities and constituent groupings.\r\nIn effect, the set of opportunities created by the character\r\nof post-Second-World-War international organizations that\r\nhave been the United Nations and its progeny has made\r\nsovereign equality a very real concept, power\r\nasymmetries notwithstanding.\r\nFor small States, certainly, the political and\r\ndiplomatic vitality of the United Nations system is a\r\nmatter of undeniable fact. Nevertheless, the United\r\nNations should continue to enhance cooperation with\r\nregional organizations, as it did last session when this\r\nAssembly resolved to institutionalize cooperation with the\r\nCaribbean Community. Belize was honoured to introduce\r\nthat resolution.\r\nLikewise, the principle of inclusiveness should be\r\nemployed to ensure that States in the various regions of\r\nthe world, including Asia and the Pacific, are not\r\nconfined to incomplete participation in the international\r\norder.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nI turn now to the economic sphere. The record of our\r\nOrganization is, I am afraid, rather less compelling. It is\r\ntrue that various organs of the United Nations system —\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO), the Economic Commission for\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) — have\r\nprovided small States with an unprecedented forum for the\r\narticulation of our concerns. Even now, Belize prepares to\r\nassume its elected seat on the Executive Board of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme. But continuing\r\nlarge disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries,\r\nthe debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world,\r\nthe unemployment, the persistent poverty, speak volumes as\r\nto the absence of sufficient progress on this front.\r\nSince the last general debate, the World Trade\r\nOrganization has come into being. In the Americas, the\r\nHemispheric Summit is now a matter of record. But we\r\nnote with regret that, even as liberalization advances, the\r\ncall of the disadvantaged for special and differential\r\ntreatment goes unheeded. This is accompanied by the\r\ncontinuing volatility of the international trading and\r\nfinancial systems, and the well-known vulnerability of small\r\ncountries to external shocks.\r\nFor us in Belize, negative economic trends among our\r\nmajor trading partners have had a baneful effect. This, in\r\nturn, has served to heighten our concern over the nature and\r\npace of globalization. The structural changes that fragile\r\neconomies need to make in order to be in step threaten to\r\nswamp us. But no one seems to be paying attention.\r\nPerhaps new forms of regionalism are the answer. One\r\narguable example is the new Association of Caribbean\r\nStates, which will create the world’s fourth or fifth largest\r\nmarket area and of which Belize is the geographical centre\r\nand the cultural bridge.\r\nYet it is essential, we contend, that the international\r\ncommunity exhibit full sensitivity to the condition of\r\nsmallness. We remain highly susceptible to changes in the\r\nglobal marketplace; and adverse developments then impose\r\nadditional setbacks on us in the areas of competitiveness,\r\ndevelopment finance and overall fragility. For Belize, the\r\nrecent crisis in neighbouring Mexico, starkly dramatized our\r\nown precariousness.\r\nGenerally, we think, the impact of the events in\r\nMexico on the markets and economies of other countries\r\nserves as a clear warning. It is foolhardy to believe that\r\ninflexible social and economic formulas can be applied\r\nuniformly to our differing circumstances. Heedless\r\nadjustment and implacable time-tables might well\r\ncondemn small economies to extinction.\r\nIndeed, many of our small countries have already\r\nmade strenuous efforts at stabilization and reform. We\r\nhave liberalized trade, reduced fiscal deficits and\r\nprivatized State enterprises. But where are the rewards?\r\nWe continue to be overcome by debt, by poverty and by\r\nwoefully inadequate social and physical infrastructures.\r\nAnd our difficulties are exacerbated rather than solved by\r\nthe austerities that reduce government spending and\r\ncurtail our public sector investment programmes.\r\nTime is not on our side, as economic and fiscal\r\northodoxy bear inexorably down on us. Our constituencies\r\ncontinue to press us: Where is the understanding of our\r\nplight? Why is there is no capital inflow revival? What is\r\nto be done about the alarmingly high rate of\r\nunemployment? When will we see the special\r\nmechanisms to assist us with retraining, the moulding of\r\nnew technologies, and the critically needed human\r\nresources development? Can we ever seriously hope for\r\nthe dedicated financial resources that must underpin any\r\nserious effort at diversification?\r\nWe are being told that this liberalization advance —\r\nthis march of the martinets — is the panacea for our ills,\r\nbut the evidence to the contrary is quite startling. For our\r\ndomestic producers, for our banana farmers, it is a bitter\r\njoke. Global free trade, it seems to many of us, is like the\r\nHoly Roman Empire: not holy, not Roman, not an\r\nempire.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions certainly need to\r\ndemonstrate more creativity. Their too-rigid reliance on\r\nthe prevailing orthodoxy is choking us. Democracy in\r\nsmall countries will not be worth a fig if this auto-da-fé-\r\ntype insistence on these articles of faith is not leavened\r\nby a real appreciation of our peculiar needs.\r\nIt is in this context that we also call for this\r\nOrganization to promote true global cooperation in efforts\r\ntowards sustainable development. This shared quest must\r\nbe the essence of the economic relations and the\r\ndevelopment dialogue between the North and the South\r\nand among the developing countries themselves. My\r\nGovernment certainly pledges full support for the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) Unit on\r\nSouth-South Cooperation, well exemplified by the Ruta\r\nMaya tourism project of our Central America. We also\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ncall for support for strengthening the Alliance for the\r\nSustainable Development of Central America, a major\r\ninitiative for developing what we call our delicate filigree\r\nisthmus. And we welcome such relationships as Belize’s\r\nrecently concluded joint implementation pilot programme\r\nunder the Climate Change Convention.\r\nThe overarching goal of our precursors was\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar”.\r\nWell, how have we been doing on that score?\r\nIn the sphere of peace and security, some grave\r\ndevelopments have taken place in various parts of the\r\nworld. In several places genocidal impulses have been let\r\nloose, with predictably devastating results. Paradoxically\r\nenough, the end of the cold war has resulted in an upsurge\r\nof civil and territorial strife. Fratricidal conflicts have been\r\nlaunched to the drumbeat of overblown notions of history\r\nand dangerous concepts of ethnicity. For all the Assembly’s\r\nefforts, we continue to experience a relative stalemate in\r\nCyprus and elsewhere. The Balkan conundrum still seems\r\nintractable, though we note with encouragement that this\r\nOrganization has recognized that there is a limit beyond\r\nwhich forbearance ceases to be a virtue. Rwanda refuses to\r\ngo away.\r\nYet we hail now the breakthrough in Palestine, and we\r\nagain rejoice at the continuation of peace and stability in\r\nSouth Africa. In Namibia, Mozambique and Angola, the\r\nUnited Nations has assisted, or is assisting, in bringing civil\r\nwars to an end.\r\nIn my own part of the world, the continuing United\r\nNations partnership with the people of Haiti is consolidating\r\nreconstruction and democracy in that Caribbean country.\r\nDespite the limitations on our resources, Belize is happy\r\nnow to be able to play a commanding role in the Caribbean\r\nCommunity and Common Market (CARICOM) sub-unit of\r\nthe United Nations Mission in Haiti.\r\nLikewise, the United Nations Observer Mission in El\r\nSalvador is successfully overseeing efforts to cement the\r\nnewly minted peace. In Guatemala, the dialogue between\r\nthe URNG and the Government, begun under the auspices\r\nof our Secretary-General, is proceeding apace.\r\nMy Government takes great satisfaction in the calm\r\nthat reigns almost universally on our continent, from\r\nHispaniola to Tierra del Fuego. The disappearance of\r\nauthoritarian Governments in Latin America and the\r\nresolution of most of our internal conflicts is bringing\r\nliberty and democracy to all our peoples. Our efforts can\r\ntherefore be committed fully now to the business of\r\nfostering economic and social development, human rights\r\nand the protection of the environment. As the first-ever\r\nDefence Ministerial Meeting of the Americas confirmed,\r\nour militaries are fully cognizant of the new role they\r\nmust play in supporting this process.\r\nWe therefore applaud the strong and clear views on\r\nnuclear sanity expressed during the Conference on the\r\nextension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\r\nand currently being reiterated. This delegation reaffirms\r\nits own view that the parties to the NPT have now\r\ninvested in the nuclear Powers a trusteeship that those\r\nPowers must zealously discharge.\r\nAt the same time, we must be equally aware of the\r\nother danger: the continued production, trade and use of\r\nall types of so-called conventional weapons that harm,\r\nmaim and kill.\r\nIn the context of more general concerns, we cannot\r\nescape the overdue obligation to rationalize also the\r\nstructure of the Security Council, so that the veto is\r\ntamed and equity and democratization take centre stage.\r\nWe continue to insist that all regions obtain balanced and\r\nequal representation as permanent members; small\r\ncountries be brought into the Council’s decision- making;\r\nand consideration be given to such devices as multipartite\r\nseats or constituency groupings.\r\nOne final word on the question of peace and\r\nsecurity. The Secretary-General has stressed the multitude\r\nof new demands for peace-keeping made upon the\r\nOrganization as conflicts erupt around the world. The\r\ncaution has been expressed that the increased burdens in\r\nthis regard should not displace the attention that economic\r\nand social questions demand. Of course, the two are\r\ninterrelated. It is a truism that there can be no\r\ndevelopment without peace. We would content ourselves,\r\nthen, with merely urging that we put in place a more\r\ncoordinated system to embrace peace-keeping and conflict\r\nresolution as well as human rights and social and\r\neconomic development.\r\nAlso, the non-traditional threats to peace and security\r\nmust be addressed. In recent years we have witnessed\r\ngrowing links among organized crime, drug trafficking,\r\nterrorism and the spread of armaments. The dangers from\r\nthis phenomenon are all the more insidious for being\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nnovel. We must therefore quickly develop the international\r\ncooperation measures to deal with it.\r\nSo, as this Organization completes its fiftieth year, we\r\nin Belize are well convinced of its continuing vitality. The\r\njeremiads of those that bemoan its failures are not for us.\r\nWhile we are not going to be Pollyannaish about what is\r\nadmittedly a mixed record, we see enough to be sanguine\r\nabout.\r\nThere is extraordinary cooperation on the part of\r\nStates, other political entities and non-governmental\r\norganizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern\r\nof the United Nations organs; in the burgeoning,\r\nmultidimensional sphere of sustainable development; in the\r\nterritory where humane concerns and values, social ordering\r\nand cultural norms coalesce; and in the field of\r\npeace-keeping, of providing States and peoples with\r\nsecurity from violence and disorder.\r\nOf course there is still a long way to go. And we will\r\nnever truly realize the vision of the founders unless\r\nMember States agree to provide the future United Nations\r\nsystem with adequate, reliable and predictable resources.\r\nLet us therefore, during this our half-century session,\r\ndetermine to enhance our effectiveness. Let us rationalize,\r\nlet us economize. Let us pay our dues in full and on time.\r\nAnd let us intensify the quest for agreement on autonomous\r\nfinancing for the Organization and for related activities.\r\nAbove all, let us dedicate ourselves to universality and\r\npledge to enlarge our image and re-energize the world. For\r\nthat day may still be greatly postponed when our\r\nresolutions and decisions, rather than blood and iron, will\r\nsummarily determine the great international questions.\r\nBut in continuing efforts at global conflict avoidance,\r\nwe are still, if the Assembly will forgive the colloquialism,\r\nthe only game in town. In other words, true international\r\npeace and security can only ever come by way of the\r\nUnited Nations, which remains the last, best hope for\r\nmankind.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Velayati (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke in\r\nFarsi; English text furnished by the delegation): May I at\r\nthe outset congratulate President Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal on his well-deserved election to the presidency of\r\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations and assure him of the full cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran at this\r\nimportant session, which coincides with the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nLess than a month from today, Members of the\r\nOrganization will assemble in this very Hall to celebrate\r\na half-century of operation of the United Nations. Fifty\r\nyears ago, when the bitter events and experience of the\r\nSecond World War were omnipresent, the original\r\nMembers decided to establish an organization “determined\r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.\r\nThey signed the Charter of the United Nations, the result\r\nof two months of negotiations and compromise among the\r\nparticipants at the San Francisco Conference, which was\r\nto serve as the framework and the guide to prevent war\r\nand promote the economic and social advancement of all\r\nnations, large and small.\r\nHowever, it is generally acknowledged that shortly\r\nafter the establishment of the Organization, the spirit of\r\ncooperation and friendship gave way to bloc politics and\r\nrivalry, which led to the cold war and effectively\r\nprevented the achievement of the objectives enshrined in\r\nthe Charter. It would not be excessive to point to the\r\nantipathy between the two blocs as the principal cause of\r\nwars, underdevelopment of the third world, suppression of\r\nliberation struggles of nations under foreign domination,\r\nand interference in the internal affairs of others. It was\r\nthis mentality, prevalent in the bipolar world, which in\r\neffect denied the Organization the opportunity to fulfil its\r\nobligations completely, and which circumscribed the\r\nextent of participation by Member States in the\r\ndecision-making process and brought about the dominance\r\nof a few countries.\r\nAfter 50 years of turbulence, the United Nations is\r\nnow in one of its most sensitive periods. Although many\r\nproblems and obstacles of the past no longer exist, a new\r\nset of challenges have appeared, each of which has taken\r\nthe credibility, efficiency, relevance and ability of the\r\nOrganization to task, and which provide opportunities and\r\nresponsibilities to bring into conformity the modus\r\noperandi of international relations in general and the\r\nOrganization itself in particular, with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nToday the United Nations faces these challenges and\r\nopportunities at a time when it remains the only truly\r\nuniversal organization. This universality of the\r\nOrganization can naturally put tremendous resources at its\r\ndisposal to facilitate the achievement of the principles and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter, particularly the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\npromotion of economic and social development, justice and\r\nmutual cooperation, and place it in a better position to deal\r\nwith emerging challenges in a more efficient and\r\ndistinguished fashion.\r\nWhat should be of the utmost importance to the\r\nOrganization is the extent to which Member States\r\nparticipate in its decision-making process. In fact, if we\r\ndefine and assess the universality of the Organization in\r\nterms of the wide participation by Member States in its\r\ndecision-making process, and not merely in terms of the\r\nnumber of its Member States, and direct all our efforts to\r\nstrengthening such universality, we will contribute\r\ntremendously to enhancing the credibility, authority and\r\nability of the Organization. In other words, when public\r\nparticipation of all Members as sovereign States is\r\nguaranteed in decisions of the Organization and their\r\nimplementation, then the possibility of the exerting of\r\nundue influence and dominance by a few States to shape\r\nthe approach of the Organization vis-à-vis international\r\nissues according to the limited confines of their own\r\nnational interests diminishes to a large extent.\r\nRegrettably, even in the current international\r\nenvironment, certain Members continue to adopt unilateral\r\nactions contrary to the provisions of the Charter, and\r\nthereby exhibit an absence, for their part, of the spirit of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe arrogant approach and attitude of the Government\r\nof the United States of America towards the international\r\ncommunity, and the unsuccessful attempts of the American\r\nforeign policy establishment to exploit issues of global\r\nconcern, such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction, to advance an extraneous and\r\nillegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed\r\ndangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral\r\nmeasures.\r\nThe United States Secretary of State must put to rest\r\nthe illusion that his Government can become both the judge\r\nand the policeman of the global community. Nor should he\r\nexpect others to follow American pressures against\r\nindependent States brought to bear with the sole objective\r\nof pleasing Zionist pressure groups even at the expense of\r\ndisregarding the interests of the American people.\r\nPerhaps they still do not really believe in the\r\nfundamental principle of the sovereign equality of States\r\nthat constitutes the cornerstone of the United Nations and\r\nthat requires each and every Member of the Organization\r\nto play its role in securing the objectives of the Charter.\r\nThis mentality is unfortunately the unwelcome heritage of\r\nthe cold-war period when, owing to the nature of bloc\r\nrivalries, States Members of the United Nations were\r\nviewed, not as independent, sovereign equals, but as\r\nmembers of power blocs. The unfortunate natural by-\r\nproducts of such a world view are inequality, hegemony,\r\ndisrespect for the interests and spiritual values of other\r\nnations, disregard of the choices and opinions of the\r\nmajority, preference for the short-term interests of the\r\nminority and self-serving interpretations of the rules and\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nIt seems imperative, therefore, that in the new\r\ninternational political environment all organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council, should\r\nadopt substantive and procedural measures to facilitate the\r\nfull integration and participation of all Member States.\r\nThe Security Council, which constitutionally represents\r\nthe general membership of the Organization and acts on\r\nits behalf, should muster the requisite political will to deal\r\nwith all crises on the basis of principle and the same set\r\nof standards and should avoid preference for the interests\r\nof powerful States over the interests and choices of the\r\nmajority in order to discharge its responsibilities in\r\naccordance with the Charter. To achieve that objective\r\nsome structural, substantive and procedural reforms in the\r\nwork of the Council, including democratization and\r\ntransparency, are inevitable and will enhance the\r\ncredibility, efficiency and relevance of the Council as the\r\nrepresentative of the general membership.\r\nAt the same time, I should emphasize that the most\r\nimportant organ of the United Nations, the one that is the\r\nmanifestation of the principle of sovereign equality and\r\naffords direct participation to all Member States, is the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Therefore, strengthening this important\r\norgan and ensuring the accountability of other organs,\r\nparticularly the Security Council, before the General\r\nAssembly will guarantee full and more meaningful\r\nparticipation by the Organization’s general membership in\r\nits decisions and their implementation. This will go very\r\nfar towards strengthening true universality and providing\r\nthe most effective guarantees for the implementation of its\r\ndecisions.\r\nIn the past few years, following the end of the cold\r\nwar, we have witnessed increased efforts to formulate\r\nnew sets of international standards in various political,\r\nsocial and economic spheres. A thorough review of the\r\nfinal documents of recent international conferences clearly\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nillustrates that, notwithstanding the conceptual and\r\nnormative transformations which the international\r\ncommunity has undergone in the formulation and\r\nexpression of its concerns and recommendations, it has\r\nlegitimately stood firm on the need to respect the\r\nfundamental principles that preserve the very fabric of our\r\ndiverse and pluralistic world. For instance, concepts and\r\nphrases such as “the necessity and importance of upholding\r\nfull respect for the spiritual and ethical values, national and\r\nregional particularities, as well as different historical and\r\ncultural backgrounds of countries”, and “the necessity of\r\nhomogeneity and conformity in final documents and\r\nrecommendations of international conferences with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe prevalence of a spirit of international cooperation and\r\nconsensus in their implementation and follow up” have\r\nbeen incorporated and reaffirmed in the final documents of\r\nthe World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development in\r\nCairo, the World Summit for Social Development in\r\nCopenhagen, and the recently held Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing.\r\nThis clearly attests to the fact that while the\r\ninternational community has taken it upon itself to adopt a\r\njust and non-discriminatory approach through international\r\ncooperation towards the protection and promotion of all\r\nhuman rights, including the right to development, as\r\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent rights, it continues\r\nto insist on the absolute imperative of guaranteeing that in\r\nthe process of international standard-setting, promotion and\r\nprotection, the sanctity of the principle of the national\r\nsovereignty of all States is respected and that no nation’s\r\nreligious values and beliefs and cultural and national\r\nidentity are infringed.\r\nFurthermore, the Charter of the United Nations\r\nrecognizes international cooperation in economic and social\r\nissues as necessary for the maintenance of peaceful and\r\nfriendly relations between States. Unfortunately,\r\nnotwithstanding this emphasis, because of the conditions\r\nprevailing in international relations, both during and after\r\nthe cold war, the importance and centrality of issues related\r\nto economic and social development have not received due\r\nconsideration.\r\nIn addition, at a time when the North-South gap\r\ncontinues to widen on a daily basis, the world economic\r\ntrend, manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist\r\npolicies on the part of the developed countries, also tends\r\nfurther to debilitate the potential of the developing countries\r\nto deal with the adverse impacts of international economic\r\ndevelopment. In this connection, we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s “Agenda for Development” and\r\nannounce our intention to participate actively in the\r\ndeliberation of it. We firmly believe that post-cold-war\r\nopportunities should be utilized to their maximum\r\npotential so as to place issues of economic and social\r\ndevelopment at the centre of the United Nations attention.\r\nHence, there is a renewed need for recommendations\r\nabout and practical measures for expansion of the role of\r\nthe United Nations in promoting the economic\r\ndevelopment of developing countries, as well as full and\r\nrapid implementation of relevant agreements and\r\ninternationally agreed upon objectives in this field. In this\r\nconnection, the fundamental principle that States have the\r\nright to benefit from the utilization of their own resources\r\nthat are vital for their sustained economic growth and\r\ndevelopment in accordance with their national policies\r\nand priorities must not be neglected.\r\nAnother key characteristic of the post-cold-war era\r\nis the expansion of peace-keeping operations, which have,\r\nin recent years, demanded an increasing share of the\r\nenergy and resources of the Organization. Nevertheless,\r\nthe expansion of United Nations peace-keeping operations\r\nshould not take place at the expense of its activities in the\r\narea of development, which constitute one of the most\r\neffective measures for preventing the occurrence of\r\ntensions and conflicts as well as for ensuring tranquillity\r\nand stability. The Islamic Republic of Iran, along with\r\nother non-aligned countries, supports the United Nations\r\npeace-keeping efforts in principle, but emphasizes that all\r\nMember States that are willing and able to participate in\r\nsuch operations should be treated equally and without\r\ndiscrimination. In like manner, while a unified United\r\nNations command structure is essential for successful\r\npeace-keeping operations, its leadership should not be the\r\nmonopoly of a handful of States.\r\nAlthough the United Nations has been successful in\r\nreturning peace and stability to some volatile parts of the\r\nworld, its disregard for some important principles has\r\nresulted in the failure of the Organization to resolve other\r\ncrises that still rage. Let me emphasize that it is\r\nabsolutely imperative for the United Nations fully to\r\nrespect fundamental principles, including national\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of States in all phases of the\r\nestablishment and execution of peace-keeping operations.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, eager to contribute\r\nmore actively to this growing area of United Nations\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nactivity, announces its readiness in principle to participate\r\nin United Nations peace-keeping operations in accordance\r\nwith our tenets and the fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter. Here, I deem it necessary to reiterate the\r\npreparedness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to dispatch\r\npeace-keeping forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which we\r\nhad earlier committed along with other Islamic countries to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) in order to enable it to discharge effectively\r\nits mandate to protect safe areas.\r\nWe hold the firm view that if the Security Council had\r\nat least provided the necessary mandate or committed the\r\nnecessary forces for the protection of the safe areas,\r\nincluding through taking advantage of the assistance offered\r\nby the Islamic countries, the Bosnian Serbs could not have\r\ncontinued, with relative ease, their crimes of genocide\r\nagainst the defenceless people of United Nations-declared\r\nsafe areas. However, the lack of political will to suppress\r\naggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with\r\nUnited Nations decisions, coupled with the unreasonable,\r\nimmoral and legally baseless insistence by some on\r\nextending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia\r\nto the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the\r\nSerbs that they can continue with impunity their murder,\r\ndestruction, aggression, “ethnic cleansing” and genocide.\r\nSince the outbreak of the crisis, Islamic countries,\r\nincluding the Islamic Republic of Iran, have adopted a\r\nconstructive position and called for international\r\ncooperation in finding a just and peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The recent decision of\r\nthe joint meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Contact\r\nGroup and troop contributing countries to establish the\r\n“Assistance Mobilization Group” in order to address the\r\nhumanitarian, economic, legal and defence requirements of\r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents a proper\r\napproach to this tragedy in keeping with the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations.\r\nThis decision, along with the previous declaration by\r\nOIC member States of their readiness to dispatch a\r\nsufficient number of peace-keepers to Bosnia, as well as\r\ntheir declaration on the “de-jure inapplicability” of the arms\r\nembargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina are not only solidly\r\nbased in international law, the United Nations Charter and\r\nhumanitarian principles, but also emanate from the\r\nconsidered assessment that without a proper military\r\nbalance, it would be impossible to compel the Serbs to\r\nengage in serious negotiations or to guarantee the\r\nunhindered implementation of any negotiated settlement.\r\nIn this connection, the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nwelcomes the recent cooperation between the two Contact\r\nGroups, and holds that only a plan which does not entail\r\nrecognition of the fruits of “ethnic cleansing” and\r\nguarantees the national sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina as a Member of the United\r\nNations can restore peace and stability to the region.\r\nFurthermore, it is necessary in any peace negotiations to\r\naccord the non-Serb populations of Kosovo, Sanjak, and\r\nVojvodina the same rights and privileges as those\r\nrequested for the Serbs in Bosnia. Moreover, in order to\r\nguarantee a durable settlement and to preclude the\r\nrepetition of aggression and genocide, the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991 should continue its work resolutely, without\r\nany regard for political expediency, and severely pursue\r\nand punish those who are found guilty.\r\nThe increasing growth of inter-State cooperation\r\nwithin the framework of regional groupings constitutes\r\nanother characteristic of the new international climate.\r\nThere exist natural common grounds for cooperation,\r\nas well as shared interests among the countries of any\r\nregion, which together create a framework for the\r\npromotion of regional organizations. Such regional\r\ncooperation leads, in turn, to enhanced peace and stability\r\nin each region and the world through the expansion of a\r\nculture of cooperation, coexistence and dialogue. In this\r\ncontext, the Islamic Republic of Iran has emphasized\r\nregional cooperation and taken significant steps in this\r\nregard in order to enhance prosperity, peace and stability\r\nthroughout its own region.\r\nToday, the Economic Cooperation Organization\r\n(ECO) has grown to an organization with 10 members.\r\nWith a population of 336 million, rich natural resources\r\nand considerable potential, and in close proximity to\r\nimportant centres of economy and trade in Asia, Europe,\r\nand the Middle East, the organization endeavours to\r\nstrengthen and expand its activities, particularly in the\r\nareas of transportation, communications, trade and energy,\r\nin order to achieve well-being and prosperity for the\r\npeoples of the region, and to promote trade and economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nIn another effort for the expansion of regional\r\ncooperation, the Islamic Republic of Iran has made\r\nconcrete proposals for the establishment of the Caspian\r\nSea Cooperation Organization which, with the\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nparticipation of the littoral States, would aim for the\r\nexpansion of cooperation in the fields of shipping, fishing,\r\nthe protection of the environment and the exploitation of\r\nthe resources of the Caspian Sea. Fortunately, the proposal\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran has been accepted by the\r\nStates concerned, that is, the Russian Federation, the\r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Azerbaijan and the\r\nRepublic of Turkmenistan. In our opinion, the Caspian Sea\r\nmust be a sea of peace and tranquillity whose affairs will\r\nbe decided by the concurrence of all its littoral States.\r\nConsidering the political and economic characteristics\r\nof our region, and the occurrence and expansion of conflicts\r\nand tensions due to internal and external factors, the\r\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran feels nationally\r\nand internationally obliged to exert every effort aimed at\r\nthe enhancement of economic prosperity and regional\r\nsecurity, the prevention and de-escalation of tension and the\r\npeaceful resolution of regional crises, based on respect for\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, the inviolability of\r\ninternationally recognized borders, and non-interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of others.\r\nIn Afghanistan, while refraining from any involvement\r\nin the regrettable fratricidal war, our policy has focused on\r\nkeeping channels of communication open with the\r\nGovernment and all Afghan groups in order to put an end\r\nto fighting and to bring about a negotiated settlement.\r\nIn the crisis in Tajikistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nhas exerted every effort and has succeeded in securing\r\nnegotiations in Tehran at the highest level between\r\nGovernment and opposition groups, leading to the signing\r\nof significant agreements concerning a cease-fire and the\r\npeace process. Attempts to find solutions to these crises\r\nrequire the constructive engagement of regional States and\r\nthe effective participation of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nAt the same time, the maintenance of internal and\r\nregional stability and security in Central Asia and the\r\nCaucasus requires economic prosperity. The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, in view of the special economic and\r\ngeographical situation of regional States, has tried to serve\r\nas a reliable economic and trade partner, through bilateral\r\neconomic cooperation, as well as the establishment of\r\ntrilateral commissions with the participation of States from\r\nwithin and outside the region aimed at the expansion and\r\nfacilitation of trade.\r\nInter-State cooperation in the sensitive and strategic\r\narea of the Persian Gulf, where regional States share many\r\ncommonalities, can also lead to economic prosperity, as\r\nwell as guaranteeing peace and stability. The military\r\npresence of foreign Powers, who have interests at\r\nvariance with stability and long-term cooperation among\r\nregional States, cannot be conducive to achieving the\r\ncommon objective of securing the tranquillity of this\r\nimportant waterway.\r\nIn the final analysis, all littoral countries of the\r\nPersian Gulf would be better served if they were to join\r\nhands in a concerted effort to maintain peace and security\r\nin the region, which will directly affect our destiny. Such\r\nefforts can be channelled through an institution organized\r\nby these same littoral States, where confidence-building\r\nmeasures commensurate with the specificities of the area\r\ncan be devised and followed up.\r\nReducing military budgets, setting a ceiling for arms\r\npurchases, acceding to disarmament and arms-control\r\ntreaties, cooperating with the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms and devising a mechanism for\r\ntransparency in armaments are but a few examples of\r\nconfidence-building measures which the aforementioned\r\ninstitution could consider. The Islamic Republic of Iran\r\ndeclares its full readiness to enter into bilateral and\r\nmultilateral negotiations with its neighbours in order to\r\nreach common understandings on these issues.\r\nIn the Middle East, the Zionist entity, supported by\r\ncertain powerful countries, continues its occupation of\r\nPalestine and parts of Syria and Lebanon, and persists in\r\nits policies of aggression, suppression of those who dare\r\nto express opposition to its illegal occupation, and\r\nviolation of the very basic human rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nExperience and the events of the past few years\r\nfurther illustrate the fact that the only viable option for\r\nrestoring peace and security to the Middle East is one\r\nwhich is comprehensive and just and which addresses the\r\nfundamental issues of the Palestine question. Such a\r\nsolution should entail a realization of the inalienable\r\nrights of the Palestinian people, including the return of all\r\nPalestinian refugees and displaced persons to their\r\nhomeland, the full and free exercise of their right to self-\r\ndetermination, and liberation of all occupied territories. In\r\nview of the volatility of the Middle East and the Persian\r\nGulf, these two regions must be off limits to any foreign\r\nmilitary presence and weapons of mass destruction. My\r\nGovernment continues to underscore the need to\r\nimplement numerous General Assembly resolutions as\r\nwell as the decision of the Review and Extension\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nConference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to establish a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as an\r\nimportant factor for installing stability in the region. What\r\nhas actually prevented the NPT from achieving its\r\nobjectives and the establishment of the Middle East as a\r\nzone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction has been Israel’s illegal nuclear capabilities and\r\nits refusal to join the NPT and put its unsafeguarded\r\nnuclear facilities under the safeguard regime of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\r\nUndoubtedly, without the direct and indirect financial\r\nand technological support of certain Western\r\nnuclear-weapon States, Israel could not have acquired the\r\ncapability to develop nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, there\r\nexist strong indications that the nuclear capability of that\r\nregime is being continually increased by the very same\r\ncountries that are the most vocal proponents of nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation. This discriminatory trend persists even in\r\ncircumstances where Israeli nuclear policy has adversely\r\naffected regional security, the negative effects of which\r\ninclude a lack of confidence and a perception of insecurity\r\nin the region, an escalating arms race and influx of foreign\r\nweapons into the region, and the refusal of some States in\r\nthe region to join certain disarmament treaties.\r\nOn the international level, it must be acknowledged\r\nthat, despite the modest progress achieved in the control of\r\nnuclear, chemical and conventional weapons, these weapons\r\nhave unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively\r\nto an alarming degree. We are of the view that the failure\r\nof the international community to deal effectively with\r\nthese weapons is primarily due to the fact that major\r\nproducers of conventional weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction have prevented the United Nations from\r\nfulfilling its primary responsibility and central role in the\r\nfield of disarmament. Another main reason for this failure\r\nis that the policies of major arms-producing countries\r\ndesigned to control the spread of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and conventional weapons are always\r\nshort-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at\r\nsecuring the destructive power of their own weaponry and\r\ntheir own military dominance.\r\nA glance at generally unsatisfactory disarmament\r\nnegotiations in various fields, including nuclear\r\ndisarmament, the Hague negotiations on the chemical\r\nweapons Convention, negotiations concerning verification\r\nsystems for the bacteriological weapons Convention, and\r\nthe performance of the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms make the veracity of our contention\r\nquite evident.\r\nFollowing four weeks of difficult negotiations, the\r\n1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT could\r\nnot reach the conclusion that any progress towards the\r\nprimary objectives of the Treaty, including complete\r\nnuclear disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy, had been achieved in the past 25 years. The\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty must be viewed within\r\nthe framework of three major final documents of the\r\nConference, together with the necessity for all signatories,\r\nparticularly the nuclear Powers, to commit themselves to\r\nthe full implementation of all provisions and objectives of\r\nthe Treaty. These obligations include achieving complete\r\nnuclear disarmament, expanding the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy, strengthening the role and enhancing the\r\nauthority of the IAEA as the only international body\r\ncompetent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member\r\nStates’ responsibilities under the Treaty, ensuring the\r\nuniversality of the NPT as an urgent priority, and\r\nestablishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear\r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In this\r\nconnection, the nuclear-weapon States should, as a first\r\nstep, prove their good faith by refraining from nuclear\r\ntesting and finalizing a comprehensive test-ban treaty in\r\n1996.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, inspired by the divine\r\nteachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarity\r\nand the continued participation and efforts of its people,\r\nhas endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person and respect for\r\nhuman values, a society whose ethos includes fairness and\r\nsocial justice as well as cultural, social and economic\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, despite extensive damage\r\ncaused by the imposed war and other economic pressures,\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, endowed with the resolve\r\nand work ethic of its entire population, has been able not\r\nonly to move towards reversing the vast destruction of the\r\nwar, but also successfully to complete its first five-year\r\neconomic and social development plan and embark upon\r\nthe implementation of the second five-year plan on solid\r\nfoundations. We foresee bright prospects for a\r\nstrengthened economic, social, cultural and political\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nSince the Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes\r\nthat the maintenance of peace and security, at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels alike, is\r\ndependent upon economic growth and sustained\r\ndevelopment, we spend only about 1 per cent of our\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nnational budget on defence and devote the rest to\r\noverhauling and strengthening our economic, social and\r\ncultural infrastructures. We have made this strategic\r\ndecision at a time when the bitter experience of military\r\naggression against my country, a foreign military presence\r\nin the region and an alarming military build-up following\r\nthe second war in the Persian Gulf could have justified very\r\nextensive military expenditures.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly provides\r\na golden opportunity for us to engage in a serious review\r\nof the performance of our Organization over the past 50\r\nyears, assess the current international situation and try to\r\nshape the conduct of international relations in the light of\r\nthe United Nations Charter in a fashion that remedies the\r\nshortcomings of the past.\r\nThe most important characteristic of our world is its\r\ncultural diversity, which has enriched human civilization.\r\nThe experience of the past 50 years has clearly illustrated\r\nthat attempts to impose Western standards, beliefs and\r\nculture upon the rest of humanity have not only failed to\r\nachieve the desired results, but also undermine the\r\nfoundations of peaceful coexistence and mutual\r\nunderstanding because, in spite of the appearance of\r\nchampioning the cause of freedom and tolerance, such an\r\napproach manifests extreme intolerance towards the values\r\nand beliefs of others.\r\nMutual respect for the rights, values and beliefs of all\r\nmembers of the international community, along with the\r\nempowerment of all nations to participate actively in the\r\nsetting of international norms, the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity and the promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment throughout the world must form the solid\r\nfoundation of Member States’ activities in the next 50 years\r\nof the United Nations. The Islamic Republic of Iran is\r\nprepared to fulfil its role in this respect.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Riivo Sinijärv.\r\nMr. Sinijärv (Estonia): Allow me to begin by\r\ncongratulating the President on his election at this historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the\r\nEstonian people, I wish him all the best this year.\r\nFifty years ago this body met for the first time in an\r\neffort to unite the community of nations to avoid a\r\nrepetition of the carnage we saw in the Second World War.\r\nFor my country, that war finally ended just last year, with\r\nthe withdrawal of foreign troops from our territory. I am\r\nhappy to note that tomorrow the final remnant of\r\noccupation, in the form of the former Soviet\r\nnuclear-submarine training facility at Paldiski, will be\r\nturned over to Estonian authorities by Russian civilian\r\ndismantling specialists. I take this opportunity to\r\nacknowledge Estonia’s satisfaction with the Russian\r\nFederation’s having fulfilled its commitment in this\r\nregard, as mandated by the agreement signed by Russia\r\nand Estonia on 30 July 1994.\r\nTurning to the work of the United Nations, the\r\ndeclarations and decisions produced by recent\r\ninternational conferences must be integrated into the work\r\nof the United Nations as a whole. Estonia places\r\nparticular importance upon the implementation of Agenda\r\n21 and the Vienna Declaration. We welcome the\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and look forward to a successful\r\nconclusion of negotiations regarding a universal and\r\nverifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty. The importance\r\nof these and other recently concluded international\r\nagreements must be underscored through implementation.\r\nThere are a number of ways through which the\r\nUnited Nations can improve its performance. One of the\r\nmost extensive ways in which Member States relate to the\r\nUnited Nations system is by way of the activities of\r\nvarious United Nations agencies and programmes. For\r\nthis reason, reform of the Economic and Social Council\r\nis crucial and should be addressed in earnest. Member\r\nStates should have greater opportunities to ensure that\r\nUnited Nations resources are used in an effective and\r\nefficient manner. I am referring not to a need for the\r\nmicromanagement of agencies, programmes and projects,\r\nbut, rather, to participation in agency, programme and\r\nproject activities.\r\nI would like to single out and commend the work of\r\nthe Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and other\r\nregional commissions. The ECE has worked diligently to\r\nprovide practical and needed support for the integration of\r\ncountries with diverse histories into a cohesive regional\r\nwhole. As part of continuing United Nations reform,\r\nEstonia once again urges greater cooperation between the\r\nECE and the United Nations Development Programme.\r\nAny discussion of United Nations reform must\r\ninclude the composition and functioning of the Security\r\nCouncil. Estonia welcomes the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform, which,\r\namong other practical suggestions, calls for developing\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\ngreater transparency and the inclusion of more Member\r\nStates in decision making. Within the context of continuing\r\ndebate over Security Council reform, we reiterate our\r\nsupport for an expanded and more effective Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn the 40 years from 1948 to 1988, the United Nations\r\ndeployed 13 peace-keeping operations. In the seven years\r\nfrom 1988 to the present, 16 operations were begun, of\r\nwhich a significant number still continue. There are many\r\nsystemic reasons for such a dramatic increase in peace-\r\nkeeping operations, and the issues of both peace-keeping\r\nand peacemaking call for further detailed examination.\r\nRegional peace-keeping efforts that are conducted under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations must remain under stringent\r\nUnited Nations control.\r\nThe Security Council, in turn, must carefully define\r\nand monitor any mandates granted to regional efforts and\r\nmust resist attempts by groups of States or individual\r\ncountries to wrest authority for such actions. Only in this\r\nway can the United Nations ensure compliance with the\r\nprinciples of multilateralism and impartiality in order to\r\nconduct peace-keeping operations that are not only\r\neffective, but also politically neutral.\r\nEstonia is proud to be taking part in peace-keeping\r\nefforts. Through generous support, especially that of the\r\nDanish Government, Estonian peace-keepers, for the first\r\ntime ever, took part in United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. Having participated in the United Nations\r\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR), and now the United\r\nNations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia\r\n(UNCRO), we look forward to expanding our role in\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping activities.\r\nI am gratified to support the working arrangement\r\nbetween the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) in the former Yugoslavia. Estonia\r\nregards the United Nations-mandated NATO air strikes in\r\nrecent weeks in Bosnia as an unfortunate but necessary\r\nmeans of bringing about an end to the fighting which is still\r\ntaking place there. Recent cooperation between the United\r\nNations and NATO shows that despite the inherent\r\ndifficulties in supporting peace in the former Yugoslavia,\r\ndifferences can be overcome and a joint approach to peace-\r\nkeeping can be agreed upon. We view this cooperation as\r\na harbinger of greater effectiveness in future United Nations\r\npeace-keeping efforts.\r\nAn area to which Estonia attaches particular\r\nimportance is the work of the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, Mr. José Ayala Lasso, and the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights in Geneva. In keeping with its open-door\r\npolicy towards the work of human rights groups, Estonia\r\nwelcomes and supports the work done by the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights. We believe that information about the\r\nwork of the Commissioner and the Centre should be made\r\navailable to a wider audience through more frequent\r\npublication of the results of investigations. This would\r\nhelp ensure that the efforts of partisan political concerns\r\nthat tend to rely on inaccurate information will be\r\ncountered by factual, impartial reporting of the sort that\r\nMr. Ayala Lasso and the Centre provide.\r\nDuring this United Nations fiftieth anniversary year,\r\nit is important for every Member State to affirm its\r\nfinancial commitment to the United Nations. Estonia, for\r\nits part, supports recent changes to the methodology used\r\nto calculate assessments, changes which have led to\r\nreduced distortions and affirmation of capacity to pay as\r\nthe primary, transparent and universally applied criteria\r\nby which assessments are calculated. Agreed upon regular\r\nbudget assessments and peacekeeping dues are collective\r\nresponsibilities for the functioning of the United Nations,\r\nand should be put ahead of individual partisan interests.\r\nWe face new challenges on this, the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. I wish all of us the\r\nbest in meeting those challenges, so that the next 50 years\r\nmay be even more constructive than the last.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nTwo representatives have requested to speak in exercise\r\nof the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\ndecision 34/401, statements in exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention\r\nand five minutes for the second, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Gaussot (France)(interpretation from French):\r\nSeveral delegations mentioned the question of nuclear\r\ntests. Their statements have prompted the French\r\ndelegation to recall the facts and to put the last series of\r\ntests by France in perspective that of a complete and final\r\nhalt to nuclear testing.\r\nThe carrying out by France of the current\r\nprogramme must be regarded as what it is: a completion;\r\nthe tests will be limited to eight at most and will be\r\nfinished before the end of May 1996.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nAbove all, our primary objective is to achieve in 1996\r\nthe conclusion of a truly meaningful test-ban treaty - that is,\r\nbanning all nuclear-weapon tests and all other nuclear\r\nexplosions.\r\nThe major problem is the scope of such a treaty. As\r\nthe Assembly knows, on 10 August last at the Conference\r\non Disarmament France announced that it endorsed that\r\nobjective and formulation.\r\nThis choice is of capital importance. I repeat that if\r\nthe treaty is signed in accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolutions France will refrain from all nuclear-weapon tests\r\nand all other nuclear explosions. This is the zero-option\r\nchoice, which gives full meaning to the signing of the\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty.\r\nBut to achieve that, to bring the negotiations to that\r\nconclusion, France must be able in the short time set -\r\nbefore the end of May 1996 - to be sure, for the future, of\r\nthe reliability and security of its weapons and acquire\r\nindependent command of simulation techniques.\r\nThis programme to complete our tests will allow\r\nFrance to be the advocate for the most satisfactory and\r\nexacting option for the test-ban treaty.\r\nThis programme does not harm the environment;\r\ninternationally renowned experts have recently demonstrated\r\nthe harmless nature of our tests.\r\nThis programme is in accordance with the law and\r\nFrance’s commitments: extreme restraint is not a ban, and\r\nwe had never ruled out the possibility of our completing\r\nthis series of tests.\r\nFinally, as the Assembly knows, the International\r\nCourt of Justice has just ruled in France’s favour by\r\nrejecting, on 22 September, the claims made by certain\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): In speaking this morning of terrorism and the\r\nthreat it poses to the lives of people, the United States\r\nSecretary of State mentioned sanctions imposed by the\r\nSecurity Council against my country because two of our\r\nnationals have been suspected of being involved in the\r\nLockerbie incident. Mr. Christopher made the irrevocable\r\njudgement that my country had a hand in this tragic\r\nincident. This linking of my country with terrorism and the\r\nLockerbie incident by the leading diplomat of the United\r\nStates of America has been repeated on several occasions.\r\nThe United States indicts and condemns even before\r\nany trial. Members of this Assembly should know that\r\nthat is the main reason why my country does not agree to\r\nthe extradition of the suspects to either the United States\r\nor the United Kingdom. Both these countries are\r\nadversaries, and have repeatedly condemned the suspects\r\nbefore trial.\r\nMy country has repeatedly condemned terrorism in\r\nall its forms. We have also declared our readiness to\r\nparticipate in any international effort aimed at combating\r\nand eradicating terrorism. The fact is that my country is\r\na prime victim of terrorism. The United States itself has\r\npractised various types of terrorism against us, from the\r\nimposition of embargoes to military provocations in our\r\nterritorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful\r\ncities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering\r\nof ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry\r\nout acts of sabotage inside Libya, with the assistance of\r\nUnited States authorities.\r\nMy country strongly supports the Arab League\r\ninitiative for trying both suspects by Scottish judges in\r\naccordance with Scottish law at the International Court in\r\nThe Hague. We are committed to having the suspects\r\nstand trial at that Court. We are also committed to pay\r\nany compensatory damages if awarded.\r\nWe also reserve the right to sue the United States,\r\nthe United Kingdom and the United Nations, if the\r\nsuspects are acquitted, for compensation for the damages\r\ncaused. If the\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 25 September 1995\r\nUnited States Secretary of State is serious about combating\r\nterrorism, he must accept this initiative, ask the Security\r\nCouncil to lift and revoke the unjust sanctions imposed on\r\nmy country, end the American boycott, and start negotiating\r\nto find solutions to the problems between the two countries\r\nand normalize relations in the interests of both the Libyan\r\nand the American peoples.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.05 p.m.\r\n34\r\n"
