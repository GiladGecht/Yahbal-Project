(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The first\r\nspeaker this morning is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSpain, His Excellency Don Javier Solana Madariaga, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Solana (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nshould like at the outset to convey to you, Sir, my most\r\ncordial and sincere congratulations on your election as\r\nPresident of the Assembly. Both Spain, Portugal’s sister\r\ncountry, and the European Union, on behalf of which I\r\nhave the honour to address the Assembly today, are\r\nconfident that your work will meet with the greatest\r\nsuccess. I am firmly convinced that your experience as an\r\neminent professor of international law and your thorough\r\nknowledge of international relations will contribute\r\ndecisively to the Assembly’s achieving its ambitious goals.\r\nI should like also to thank Minister Amara Essy of\r\nCôte d’Ivoire for the excellent manner in which he\r\nconducted our deliberations during the previous session of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nLikewise, I wish to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, together\r\nwith my congratulations on the work he has accomplished\r\nthroughout his mandate.\r\nIn order to speed up the work of the Assembly, I\r\nintend to shorten my statement, the complete text of\r\nwhich will be published in a separate document.\r\nI am addressing this Assembly on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, whose membership has increased to 15\r\nStates since the beginning of this year, thereby reinforcing\r\nits capacity to fulfil its commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. The\r\nEuropean Union, fully aware of the complex challenges\r\nfaced by the international community, wishes to reiterate\r\nits full support for our Organization as a universal forum\r\nfor realizing humankind’s aspirations to peace and\r\nsecurity and economic and social progress.\r\nAgainst this background, the European Council, at\r\nits meeting in Cannes on 26 and 27 June, paid tribute, in\r\na solemn declaration, to the work of our Organization and\r\nto the half-century’s activities of the United Nations.\r\nIn a few weeks the Heads of State and Government\r\nof the entire world will solemnly commemorate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization.\r\nAlthough this occasion will give us an opportunity to\r\nassess the work accomplished by the Organization over\r\nthe course of its already long history, we must above all\r\nreflect on the best way of preparing the United Nations to\r\nmeet effectively the challenges facing us at the end of this\r\ncentury. Let me recall, with regard to this moment in the\r\nexistence of the United Nations, a thought expressed by\r\nJean Monnet in respect of the European Community,\r\nwhen the latter was taking its first steps:\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\n“This is only a stage towards the forms of\r\norganization of the world of tomorrow.”\r\nIndeed, the disappearance of old rivalries has not\r\nmeant the end of conflicts. Today we are witnessing ethnic\r\nand nationalistic conflicts and humanitarian crises of\r\nfrightening proportions; a worsening of economic\r\ninequalities; contempt for human rights; the systematic\r\nviolation of the rules of international humanitarian law;\r\ngenocide; the risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction; and the alarming deterioration of the\r\nenvironment. These are some of the most serious problems\r\nwe face today. They affect us all, and we must all make a\r\ncommitment to solve them.\r\nAlthough, as usual, a number of issues of concern to\r\nthe European Union are dealt with in detail in the\r\nmemorandum distributed as an integral part of this\r\nstatement, I should like to highlight some questions that are\r\nespecially important to us: the situation in the former\r\nYugoslavia, developments in Africa and the peace process\r\nin the Middle East.\r\nThe European Union continues to attach priority\r\nimportance to reaching a negotiated, just and lasting peace\r\nin the conflict that is ravaging the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia. In this regard, we express our full support for\r\nthe diplomatic process currently under way and our\r\nsatisfaction at its initial results at the meeting held in\r\nGeneva on 8 September last.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations forces in the\r\nterritories of the former Yugoslavia have played, and\r\ncontinue to play, a fundamental role. Member States of the\r\nEuropean Union are among the main troop contributors to\r\nthese forces. I wish here to pay tribute to the United\r\nNations forces and pay homage to the soldiers who have\r\nfallen in the cause of peace, many of them citizens of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe European Union has contributed substantially to\r\nalleviating the tremendous suffering that the war in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, and particularly in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, has inflicted upon the population. I wish to\r\nexpress our firm commitment to continue providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance, both bilaterally and through the\r\nrelevant United Nations organs and agencies.\r\nAfter more than three years of bloody conflict, the\r\nlatest developments in the peace process allow us to look\r\nahead with more hope. In this process, which we hope is\r\nnear at hand, the European Union intends to play a role\r\ncommensurate to its commitments in all aspects of the\r\nimplementation of the peace process, and in particular\r\nwith regard to reconstruction efforts. Violence has\r\ndestroyed property, but above all it has taken human lives\r\nand destroyed peaceful coexistence. Our main task will\r\nthus be to restore hope and offer decent living conditions\r\nto those who are still suffering the consequences of this\r\ncatastrophe.\r\nThe European Union is aware of the great challenges\r\nfacing Africa. Proof of our concern is that we are\r\nworking to find peaceful solutions to the conflict in\r\nRwanda and to the conflict in Burundi, beginning with the\r\npriority problem of the return of refugees. We support the\r\nurgent convening of a conference, under United Nations\r\nauspices, aimed at peace and stability in the Great Lakes\r\nregion.\r\nLikewise, we support the initiatives for social and\r\npolitical reconstruction in countries such as Angola and\r\nMozambique, and we welcome the work accomplished by\r\nour Organization in Angola, which, following the Lusaka\r\npeace agreement, has allowed for the establishment of the\r\nthird United Nations Angola Verification Mission\r\nUNAVEM III.\r\nWe also favour a more active role for the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in the prevention and\r\nsolution of conflicts in Africa, and we are considering\r\nways of supporting the establishment of effective\r\nmechanisms for preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping.\r\nThe European Union is also following the spread of\r\nand respect for human rights throughout the continent,\r\nand we are very much aware of the dire need of some\r\nAfrican countries. Since the revision of the Fourth Lomé\r\nConvention, the European Union has attached particular\r\nrelevance to humanitarian and food assistance, and we\r\nhave made an effort to update our various development\r\ncooperation programmes.\r\nThe European Union has always strongly supported\r\nthe peace process in the Middle East, initiated at the 1991\r\nConference held in Madrid. We warmly welcome the\r\nInterim Agreement reached recently by Israel and the\r\nPalestinian National Authority, which represents a new\r\nand important milestone in this process, and we look\r\nforward to the signing of the Agreement this coming\r\nThursday. Likewise, we are confident that in the coming\r\nmonths we will see significant progress in the Syrian and\r\nLebanese negotiating tracks, and that the whole region,\r\nwhich has already suffered enormously, will finally enter\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\ninto the dynamics of a comprehensive, just, stable and long-\r\nlasting peace.\r\nThe European Union attaches paramount importance\r\nto the work carried out by our Organization in general, and\r\nin particular by the Assembly, in favour of peace in the\r\nMiddle East. That is why one of our objectives in the\r\nsession now beginning is to ensure that the various\r\nresolutions adopted by the Assembly on the situation in the\r\nMiddle East contribute directly to the peace process,\r\nfollowing the guidelines established in previous years.\r\nI do not wish to conclude this first part of my\r\nstatement without a reference to the work of the United\r\nNations in Latin America. Its presence in Nicaragua\r\nthrough the United Nations Observer Group in Central\r\nAmerica (ONUCA), the United Nations Observer Mission\r\nfor the Verification of Electoral Process in Nicaragua\r\n(ONUVEN) and the International Commission for Support\r\nand Verification allowed for national reconciliation and the\r\nholding of elections.\r\nThe mediation between the parties and the work of the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador\r\n(ONUSAL) led to the historic achievement of ending the\r\nlong and terrible civil conflict in El Salvador, which\r\nculminated in the Chapultepec Agreements of January 1992.\r\nToday the presence of the Mission, which has the support\r\nof the European Union, contributes effectively to\r\novercoming the obstacles that still persist.\r\nIn Haiti, the multinational force and the United\r\nNations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) played a fundamental\r\nrole in the restoration of democracy and in the\r\nreconstruction of the country.\r\nIn Guatemala, the United Nations role as moderator\r\nand the work of the United Nations Mission for the\r\nVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the\r\nCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\r\nRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) have brought about\r\nsubstantive agreements on such important issues as human\r\nrights, displaced persons and indigenous populations, which\r\nwe are confident will lead to a speedy solution to the\r\nconflict. The participation of international observers in the\r\ncoming elections in November, supported by the European\r\nUnion, seems to us an effective formula. All these\r\nachievements have been realized with the invaluable help\r\nof the various Groups of Friends and the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nConscious of the universality of the challenges that\r\nlie ahead for the Organization, the European Union\r\nattaches fundamental importance to the adoption of\r\nmeasures allowing for the success and proper functioning\r\nof the United Nations in implementing the mandates\r\nentrusted to it by the Member States.\r\nIn this respect, the Organization’s serious financial\r\ncrisis, unprecedented in its history, seriously endangers\r\nthe United Nations capacity for action and is a source of\r\ngreat concern for the European Union. Our Organization\r\nwill become powerless if it does not receive the necessary\r\npolitical support from its Member States and the resources\r\nprovided by them, particularly through the full, punctual\r\nand unconditional payment of their financial contributions,\r\nin accordance with the obligations established by the\r\nCharter.\r\nTherefore, resolving the Organization’s financial\r\ncrisis is a priority objective for the European Union,\r\nwhich overall is the main contributor, both to the regular\r\nbudget and to the peace-keeping operations budgets.\r\nThis constructive attitude is what led to the\r\nparticipation of the European Union in the work of the\r\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial\r\nSituation of the United Nations. Our objective is to reach\r\na consensus as soon as possible — preferably during this\r\nsession — on the adoption of specific measures to bring\r\nabout an improvement in the Organization’s financial\r\nsituation.\r\nThe European Union wishes to underline the\r\nincreasingly urgent need to adopt a global package of\r\nmeasures to solve the United Nations grave financial\r\nsituation. These measures should contemplate, inter alia,\r\na possible review of the scale of assessments so that it\r\nwould reflect as accurately as possible the principle of the\r\ncapacity to pay, as well as the establishment of incentives\r\nand disincentives to encourage all Member States to\r\ncomply with their financial obligations.\r\nThe Agenda for Development (A/48/935), submitted\r\nlast year by the Secretary-General, identified the five\r\ndimensions of development: peace as the foundation, the\r\neconomy as the engine of progress, the environment as a\r\nbasis for sustainability, justice as a pillar of society and\r\ndemocracy as good governance.\r\nThe European Union attaches the greatest importance\r\nto the completion, before the end of the session that is\r\nnow beginning, of a substantial and innovative agenda for\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\ndevelopment, in which it is made clear that peace cannot be\r\nbuilt without at the same time promoting the social and\r\neconomic progress of the poorest people. Through the\r\ndecisions taken by the European Council held in Cannes, to\r\nwhich I have already referred, the European Union has\r\nmade clear its determination to contribute yet greater\r\nfinancial resources for development aid, within the\r\nframework of both the Lomé Convention — in the case of\r\nthe African, Caribbean and Pacific countries — and through\r\nfinancial cooperation with our Mediterranean partners and\r\nfriends.\r\nThroughout this session of the Assembly we shall pay\r\nspecial attention to the results of the important cycle of\r\nmajor conferences held over recent years under the aegis of\r\nthe United Nations for discussion of various subjects linked\r\nto development and human progress.\r\nWe need the Economic and Social Council to play a\r\nmore vigorous and more central role within the system; we\r\nmust ensure that the work of the Assembly and of the\r\nCouncil are complementary, avoiding all duplication.\r\nDuring this session the results of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, held in Copenhagen, will be\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly. The European Union firmly\r\nintends actively to consider these results, with a view to\r\nidentifying appropriate measures to ensure the follow-up\r\nand implementation of the commitments undertaken at\r\nCopenhagen. We must not allow the platforms of action\r\nadopted at United Nations conferences to remain\r\nunimplemented.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women ended in\r\nBeijing only a few days ago. The Declaration and Platform\r\nfor Action adopted at the Conference are a step forward,\r\nbacked by the results of previous United Nations\r\nconferences, on the road towards the achievement of\r\nequality, development and peace. These objectives were set\r\nout in the strategies for the advancement of women adopted\r\nin Nairobi 10 years ago.\r\nThe European Union has worked actively to achieve\r\nconsolidation of the results of the Vienna Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, in the field of human rights and\r\nfundamental liberties of women, and of the Cairo\r\nConference on Population and Development. The Platform\r\nfor Action adopted in Beijing as a result of such concern\r\nincludes important progress in human rights, notably the\r\nright of women to control and decide freely and responsibly\r\non matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and\r\nreproductive health, without coercion, discrimination or\r\nviolence.\r\nOnly three years before the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the\r\ninternational community cannot yet be entirely satisfied\r\nwith the progress achieved. This session will provide us\r\nonce again with an opportunity to take stock of the\r\nsituation regarding human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms in the world, two years after the important\r\nheadway made at the Vienna World Conference.\r\nIt is increasingly evident that respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms plays a critical role in\r\navoiding potential conflicts. We must therefore\r\nacknowledge the value of human rights in preventive\r\ndiplomacy. Some of the serious conflicts which have\r\nrecently darkened the international scene are inflicting\r\ngreat suffering on the civilian population, as illustrated by\r\nthe alarming number of displaced persons and refugees.\r\nIn this regard, the European Union wishes to reiterate its\r\nsupport for the immense task being performed by the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) in this field. At the same time, we\r\nare conscious of the harmful effects of ethnic and\r\nreligious discrimination on the emergence and\r\ndevelopment of such conflicts, and we reaffirm our\r\nconviction with regard to the need to move further in the\r\nadoption of measures to fight racism, racial discrimination\r\nand xenophobia.\r\nThe level of resources assigned by the Organization\r\nto the promotion and protection of human rights — today\r\na mere 1.7 per cent of its regular budget — continues to\r\nbe totally inadequate. A significant increase in those\r\nresources would have a positive impact on related areas,\r\nespecially on activities designed to assist development. It\r\nis increasingly clear that development, human rights and\r\ndemocracy are interlinked, as was stated in the 1986\r\nDeclaration on the Right to Development.\r\nFurthermore, the European Union attaches great\r\nimportance to the role and activities of the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and wishes once\r\nagain to draw the Assembly’s attention to the pressing\r\nneed to provide that Office with the human and financial\r\nresources required for the proper accomplishment of its\r\ntasks. We likewise support the Organization’s efforts to\r\nenhance the role and functions of the Centre for Human\r\nRights in Geneva, under the supervision of the High\r\nCommissioner.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Prosecution of\r\nPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia and the International Tribunal for\r\nRwanda are essential factors in the struggle against the\r\nimpunity of those who violate human rights. The experience\r\nof these ad hoc tribunals will undoubtedly help the work of\r\na future international criminal court, for which a draft\r\nstatute was drawn up by the International Law Commission\r\nand submitted to the Assembly’s Sixth Committee at its last\r\nsession.\r\nMankind is facing a growing number of humanitarian\r\nemergencies that require an effective response from the\r\ninternational community in order to alleviate the tragedy\r\nbeing suffered daily by tens of thousands of human beings.\r\nThe establishment of the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs has been an outstanding contribution to the\r\ninternational efforts for humanitarian assistance, a field in\r\nwhich the often hazardous work of non-governmental\r\norganizations is also of paramount importance. We deem it\r\nessential to implement the decision taken this year by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council on the need to review and\r\nreinforce the capacity of the United Nations system in the\r\narea of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThere is a need to enhance cooperation between all\r\norganizations and people, in such a way that their\r\nrespective contributions may be mutually complemented\r\nand strengthened, duplication of work avoided, and a\r\nhumanitarian continuum ensured.\r\nWe have witnessed important events this year in the\r\nfield of the environment and in the implementation of the\r\nRio agreements of 1992. Special mention should be made\r\nof the positive outcome of the Conferences of the parties to\r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity and the framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, the opening for signature\r\nof the Convention to Combat Desertification, and the\r\nestablishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests\r\nunder the aegis of the Commission for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. We welcome those developments and\r\nreiterate our determination to continue working, within the\r\nOrganization, towards greater cooperation in the field of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe United Nations Charter confers upon the\r\nOrganization the principal task of maintaining international\r\npeace and security and entrusts that major responsibility to\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe Security Council must continue to be the decision-\r\nmaking centre for issues that affect world security and\r\nmust constantly adapt to currently existing situations in\r\norder to strengthen the mechanisms set forth in the\r\nCharter itself.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council continued its work\r\nduring previous sessions of the Assembly. The members\r\nof the European Union participated actively in that work,\r\nand will continue to do so in the future.\r\nThe European Union holds the view that peace-\r\nkeeping operations and missions of preventive diplomacy\r\nare and should continue to be the focal point of the\r\nSecurity Council’s action in favour of world peace and\r\nsecurity. We welcome the updating of the Agenda for\r\nPeace submitted by the Secretary-General at the beginning\r\nof this year.\r\nI would remind the Assembly of the European\r\nUnion’s commitment to United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations, illustrated by the fact that the Union as a\r\nwhole is not only the main financial contributor to these\r\noperations, providing 37 per cent of the total budget, but\r\nalso the main provider of personnel. The European Union\r\nstands firmly behind this substantial commitment to the\r\nOrganization’s peace-keeping endeavours. We have all\r\nsuffered heavy casualties in these operations, and it is of\r\nthe utmost importance that every possible step be taken to\r\nensure the safety of United Nations personnel in peace-\r\nkeeping missions.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations in peace-keeping endeavours\r\nshould continue to be explored to optimize the use of\r\nmaterial and human resources and to put the mandates\r\nentrusted to those missions into practice in the quickest,\r\nmost efficient and successful way.As an example of the\r\nactivity of the regional organizations in this field, let me\r\nmention that on our continent the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe has already\r\ndeveloped a mechanism, still at an embryonic stage, for\r\npreventive diplomacy, the establishment of confidence-\r\nbuilding measures and the resolution of conflicts. Acting\r\non an initiative of the European Union, the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) decided at\r\nthe Budapest Summit last year to reinforce cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations and with the trans-Atlantic\r\norganizations.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nFurthermore, the European Union is studying with\r\ninterest the proposal for stand-by arrangements. To that\r\nend, the Union supports the proposals for headquarters of\r\na permanent nature, as well as for the United Nations stand-\r\nby forces system, and we are studying with interest other\r\nproposals which aim at improving the rapid reaction\r\ncapability of the United Nations with a view to shortening\r\nthe period for establishing a peace operation and facilitating\r\nits subsequent deployment.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the great step forward\r\nrecently taken within our Organization by the decision to\r\nextend the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) indefinitely. This\r\nis fundamental progress in the entire disarmament process\r\nand the pursuit of nuclear non-proliferation. The decision\r\nadopted and the strengthening of the inspection procedure\r\nand the principles and objectives of disarmament and\r\nnuclear non-proliferation constitute an enormous step in the\r\nright direction. We also welcome the steady pace of the\r\nnegotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty, which the\r\nEuropean Union hopes and is confident will be concluded\r\nin 1996 at the latest.\r\nWe must now focus our efforts on the universalization\r\nof the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The European Union\r\ninvites all States that have not yet done so to become\r\nsignatories of the NPT. Another European Union priority in\r\nthe field of nuclear disarmament is the finalization of a\r\ntreaty banning the production of fissile material for the\r\nmanufacture of nuclear weapons and explosives. The\r\nEuropean Union regrets that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament has not yet been able to set up an ad hoc\r\ncommittee to begin negotiations on this issue.\r\nOnce again, we appeal to all States that signed the\r\nConvention of the Banning of the Development, Production,\r\nStorage and Use of Chemical Weapons and their\r\nDestruction to proceed to ratify it so that it may come into\r\nforce as soon as possible.\r\nFurthermore, the control and limitation of the use of\r\ncertain conventional weapons is also cause for concern for\r\nthe European Union. Through its common action, the Union\r\naims to continue to encourage the activities of the United\r\nNations in its fight against the devastating effects of anti-\r\npersonnel mines in many territories around the world. Also\r\nin the field of conventional disarmament, we will pay\r\nspecial attention to the results of the Review Conference of\r\nthe 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the\r\nUse of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be\r\nDeemed to Be Excessively Injurious or To Have\r\nIndiscriminate Effects, in order to render it more effective\r\nand to widen its scope.\r\nWe believe in the United Nations. We believe in the\r\nuniversality, binding character and supremacy of\r\ninternational law, which is the result of the development\r\nof relations among nations and consensus among peoples.\r\nThe European Union gives its unconditional support to\r\nthe Organization’s ideals and actions.\r\nWe are sure that these first 50 years are but the first\r\nstage in an unprecedented task that presents no other\r\nalternative, given that its chief goal — that of assuring\r\nthat we all live together in peace, as well as the\r\ncomprehensive development of human beings — can be\r\nattained only through disinterested cooperation among\r\npeoples.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation, His Excellency\r\nMr. Andrei Kozyrev.\r\nMr. Kozyrev (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): First of all, allow me to congratulate my\r\ncolleague, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal,\r\nProfessor Diogo Freitas Do Amaral, on the occasion of\r\nhis election to the high post of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nEach of the 50 sessions of the General Assembly has\r\nbeen a step for the international community on a difficult\r\nroad in search of peace within itself, for the strengthening\r\nof the indispensable role of the United Nations. The\r\ncurrent session will be marked as the anniversary session\r\nby the addresses to be made by the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment in late October. Russia’s views on the\r\nprospects and difficulties of establishing partnership in a\r\nmulti-polar and interdependent world — and it is with\r\nequal partnership that we link our national and state\r\ninterests — will be stated by the Head of the Russian\r\nState, President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.\r\nIf half a century of experience of the United Nations\r\nteaches us anything, it teaches us first of all that only the\r\nequality of States and respect for the diversity of cultures,\r\nreligions and national traditions can serve as the basis for\r\nsecurity and prosperity in the modern world. But the\r\nformula “unity in diversity” also presupposes everyone’s\r\ncompliance with fundamental principles of international\r\nlaw and order, respect for human rights and the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\npromotion of economic progress. This is the essence of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, which identifies both common\r\nideals and goals and equal rights and obligations for all\r\nStates without “double standards”.\r\nThey say that generals always prepare for the last war.\r\nPoliticians and diplomats have no right to prepare for the\r\nlast peace. On the contrary, it is necessary to avoid slipping\r\nback into a bloc mentality and dividing countries into\r\n“friends and foes”, whether in politics or in economics.\r\nWe can indeed make the next 50 years an era of the\r\nUnited Nations if we accept as its basis the indivisibility of\r\ninternational security and sustainable social and economic\r\ndevelopment for all.\r\nThis question becomes more and more acute against\r\nthe background of humanitarian disasters in Africa and\r\nother regions of the “third world”, and the social price of\r\nthe initial stage of reforms in the post-socialist countries.\r\nNo one will be able to hide from global problems behind\r\ndividing lines of national egotism and economic\r\ndiscrimination, or even expanding military alliances. Such\r\nthings will not rein in, but rather spur on the spread of\r\ninternational terrorism and drugs, and whip up the flames\r\nof local conflicts and the arms race.\r\nOne of the principles of the “Agenda for\r\nDevelopment” which is being formulated now should be the\r\nearly elimination of the remaining discriminatory\r\nrestrictions in the world economy, trade and technology\r\ntransfer. In particular, Russia, which is successfully\r\nimplementing unparalleled reforms, should be recognized as\r\nan equal trade and economic partner with an economy in\r\ntransition.\r\nSuch a strategy should also provide for the promotion\r\nof the economic rehabilitation of countries and regions\r\naffected by armed conflicts. The United Nations, its\r\nspecialized agencies and Member States should immediately\r\nbegin to address directly the problem of the economic\r\nrehabilitation of Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia as a\r\nwhole, whose peoples have suffered from war and\r\neconomic sanctions that have been in effect for too long.\r\nRussia is ready to take an active part in these efforts, and\r\nwe do and will continue to contribute substantially to a\r\npolitical settlement. The real chances for such a settlement\r\nshould not be sacrificed to power or unilateral approaches.\r\nThe international community should make equally\r\ngreat efforts to achieve progress in all aspects of the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East and the post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation of all States of that region. We congratulate\r\nIsrael and the Palestinians on the occasion of their\r\nreaching an agreement in Taba, whose official signing\r\nceremony will take place on 28 September next in\r\nWashington under the chairmanship of President Clinton.\r\nWe intend to continue our joint efforts with the United\r\nStates and to make our contribution to the coming\r\nAmman summit conference.\r\nEurope needs a new model of general and\r\ncomprehensive security, without double standards or\r\ndividing lines.\r\nInternational dialogue on this issue is already under\r\nway. I believe that the active involvement of the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies is necessary to the\r\nefforts aimed at the development of this model.\r\nIncidentally, the General Assembly was born in the Old\r\nWorld.\r\nA new approach is required to disarmament issues in\r\nEurope. On the basis of the implementation of the\r\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (certainly\r\ntaking into account new realities) as early as next spring\r\nwe should arrive at new major agreements based on the\r\nunity of the vital security interests of the peoples of the\r\ncontinent instead of the bloc logic of the past.\r\nOur proposal to all nuclear-weapon States to\r\nelaborate a treaty on nuclear safety and strategic stability\r\nhas become even more timely.\r\nThe indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty establishes favourable conditions for this. Our\r\ncommon task is to create the necessary political\r\nconditions for those States that have not already done so\r\nto accede to it as non-nuclear States. We consider it\r\nnecessary, as a matter of priority, to conclude as soon as\r\npossible, but not later than 1996, work on the\r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. From this rostrum, Russia\r\ncalls for a universal and permanent moratorium on\r\nnuclear tests.\r\nThe summit of the “Political Eight” on nuclear\r\nsafety, which is to be held next spring in Moscow at the\r\ninitiative of the President of Russia and which was\r\napproved in Halifax, will make a major contribution to\r\nglobal stability.\r\nWe would like the United Nations to take urgent\r\nmeasures on the prevention of illicit trafficking in light\r\nfirearms and the proliferation of anti-personnel mines. It\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nis these “light” firearms that have led to enormous human\r\nlosses in Rwanda and Angola, Liberia and Bosnia,\r\nTajikistan and Abkhazia. Russia has already introduced a\r\nmoratorium on the export of the most dangerous types of\r\nanti-personnel mines. We urge other States to follow our\r\nexample.\r\nThis issue should be seriously considered in the United\r\nNations Disarmament Commission. While supporting the\r\nactivities of the Commission, we believe that it should\r\nadopt a new agenda corresponding to the current scale of\r\ncooperation in the area of security and to new threats and\r\nchallenges in this field.\r\nThe problem of global adherence to a single standard\r\nin the area of human rights and basic democratic\r\ninstitutions is very acute. Russia, approaching free,\r\nmultipartite parliamentary and presidential elections, is\r\nmaking its own contribution to the establishment of these\r\nvery standards. We invite observers from foreign States and\r\ninternational organizations to attend the forthcoming\r\nelections.\r\nIt was not so long ago that dozens of agenda items of\r\nthe General Assembly were devoted to the struggle against\r\napartheid. Now it seems unbelievable that this problem has\r\nbeen solved, owing to a large extent, to the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations. I sincerely welcome the accomplishments\r\nof the people and the Government of South Africa, headed\r\nby Nelson Mandela, in the democratization and creation of\r\na free, multiracial society.\r\nBut did we manage to overcome the danger of\r\nviolence arising through fascism, racism, and political and\r\nreligious extremism? Alas, the answer is far from\r\nreassuring. That is why the international community has no\r\nright to abandon its efforts in this direction and must not\r\ntolerate the emergence of double standards.\r\nThe signing of the CIS conventions on human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms and on the rights of national and\r\nlanguage minorities was the response of the CIS States to\r\nthe United Nations recommendations on the creation of a\r\nsingle humanitarian sphere in this part of the world.\r\nHowever, much has yet to be done before a unitary\r\napproach to human rights can become a norm of life for,\r\namong others, 25 million of our compatriots in some\r\ncountries of the Commonwealth and the Baltic States. A\r\ndouble standard here is unacceptable.\r\nRussia is interested in the adoption at this session of\r\ndecisions on such issues as the struggle against racism, all\r\nforms of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism, ensuring\r\nthe rights of minorities and the promotion of democracy\r\nand the rule of law in countries in transition. The United\r\nNations should further pursue its policy of qualitative\r\nimprovement of the international human rights protection\r\nmachinery, primarily by strengthening its control and\r\npreventive functions and enhancing its focus on specific\r\naction. The policy of single standards must become an\r\nincontestable rule in the sphere of peace-keeping as well.\r\nJustice without force is powerless, while force without\r\njustice is tyrannical.\r\nThere have been many achievements in United\r\nNations peace-keeping efforts. Without the Blue Helmets,\r\nthe world would be much more dangerous and dozens of\r\nconflicts would have been much more bloody. We are\r\nproud that approximately 20,000 Russian servicemen are\r\nserving as peace-keepers in United Nations and CIS\r\noperations.\r\nHowever, if we want force always to go hand-in-\r\nhand with justice in the activities of the United Nations\r\nand those who cooperate in them, strict observance of\r\nSecurity Council decisions must be ensured. Here, the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff can always count on the\r\nsupport of Russia and, I am confident, of all other\r\nMembers of the United Nations. The United Nations\r\nshould be protected from setbacks like that which has\r\noccurred in Bosnia.\r\nIn general, it is necessary radically to improve\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping through precision of the\r\ncriteria and terms of the United Nations involvement in\r\nareas of tension; a close linkage between peace-keeping\r\noperations and efforts to achieve the peaceful settlement\r\nof conflicts; the efficient operation of the whole\r\nfunctional chain — peace-keeping planning, command\r\nand control. We are for the earliest possible\r\nimplementation of the Secretary-General’s proposal on the\r\nestablishment of United Nations reserve forces.\r\nWe welcome the conclusion of the Convention on\r\nthe protection of United Nations personnel, which I\r\nsigned today on behalf of Russia. This instrument will\r\nhelp to save lives of hundreds of peace-keepers in hot\r\nspots of the world.\r\nPeace-making activities undertaken by Russia and its\r\nCommonwealth partners contribute to a considerable\r\nextent to ensuring regional and international stability. We\r\nappreciate fruitful cooperation with the United Nations in\r\nTajikistan and Georgia. However, the United Nations\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nsupport of our collective efforts sometimes unfortunately\r\nreminds us of a saying: “Too little, too late”. Russia,\r\ntogether with its CIS partners, expects the United Nations\r\nto make a radical change in its attitude towards peace-\r\nmaking problems in our part of the world.\r\nDuring the 50 years of the existence of the United\r\nNations, sanctions have been an instrument that the\r\nOrganization has used to deal with the instigators of\r\nconflicts. Now, the time has come to give this instrument\r\na more selective and precise nature. The principal criteria\r\nin this regard are: distinct objectives underlying sanctions,\r\nadvanced coordination of conditions, and mechanisms for\r\nlifting them once the objectives are attained.\r\nAs a newly elected member of the Executive Council\r\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, Russia intends to make an essential contribution\r\nto overcoming a new global crisis, namely the tragedy of\r\nmillions of refugees. To this end, we intend to seek\r\npractical results from the international conference on\r\nrefugees and migrants within the post-Soviet space.\r\nAt this session the General Assembly should give new\r\nimpetus to collective efforts by the international community\r\nin combating crime, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism.\r\nThe explosions in Oklahoma and Paris, the taking of\r\nhostages in Budennovsk and chemical terrorist attacks in\r\nTokyo — these are bells tolling for us all.\r\nWhatever agenda item we consider, we are convinced\r\ntime and again that the answers are to be found only on the\r\nbasis of a single standard: respect for the United Nations\r\nCharter and for the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations that have withstood the severe tests of the past five\r\ndecades and are lighting the way into the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nHis Excellency the Right Honourable Malcolm Rifkind.\r\nMr. Rifkind (United Kingdom): May I first\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency\r\nin this most important year for the United Nations.\r\nIt is nearly half a century since the General Assembly\r\nof the United Nations first met, in London. King George VI\r\ntold the visiting representatives of 50 countries that no more\r\nimportant meeting had ever taken place there. The founders\r\nof the United Nations had taken on themselves a heavy\r\nresponsibility and a noble work.\r\nToday we must pay tribute to those founders and\r\ntheir efforts. Earlier models of collective security had\r\nsoon crumbled. The League of Nations collapsed after\r\nless than two decades. The United Nations has proved\r\nmore durable. Over 50 years it has helped spread peace\r\nin place of war. It has worked to push back hunger and\r\ndisease and to advance democracy and human rights.\r\nWithout the United Nations we would have a bleaker\r\nworld.\r\nI am delighted to add Britain’s voice to these\r\ncelebrations at the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. After five decades it is timely to recall what\r\nthe United Nations has achieved. At the start of a new\r\nhalf-century it is right to weigh the lessons of past\r\nexperience.\r\nThe United Nations is a means to an end. Its value\r\nlies not simply in the shared principles and ambitions\r\nenshrined in the Charter, but in practical results. Its\r\nsuccesses are real.\r\nThe United Nations has been a force for peace.\r\nFrom Korea in the 1950s to Kuwait in the 1990s, it has\r\nhelped check and reverse the tides of aggression. In the\r\nNear East and Cyprus, United Nations troops have\r\nworked for decades to sustain a measure of stability. In\r\nCambodia the United Nations mounted its most complex\r\noperation ever to rebuild a country shattered by 13 years\r\nof war. In Mozambique United Nations peace-keepers\r\nhave helped demobilize 100,000 combatants, allowing\r\ndemocratic elections and the creation of a unified army.\r\nThe United Nations has been a source of relief from\r\nsuffering. Since 1951 the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has provided\r\nfood, shelter, medicine and education for over 30 million\r\nrefugees. United Nations programmes have immunized 80\r\nper cent of the world’s children against disease. United\r\nNations sanitation and nutrition projects have halved child\r\nmortality in developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations has been a motor for democracy\r\nand sustainable development. It has given electoral help\r\nto over 40 countries. Its charters and covenants set\r\ninternational standards of human rights. It has brokered\r\nagreements to conserve world forests and fish stocks.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nThe United Nations has done good work for five\r\ndecades. My country, the United Kingdom, has been at its\r\nheart from the start. From the drafting of the Charter, as the\r\nfirst host, in London, of the General Assembly and of the\r\nSecurity Council, we have been a staunch supporter of the\r\nUnited Nations. From the first stirrings of environmental\r\nconcern in the 1960s, to the fight against AIDS since the\r\n1980s, through to management innovation and financial\r\nreform in the 1990s, Britain has been a driving force for the\r\nchanging agenda of the United Nations. In 1947 we were\r\na party to the first case to come before the International\r\nCourt of Justice. This year a British judge became the\r\nCourt’s first ever woman member.\r\nEven before the end of the cold war, British forces\r\nhad served the United Nations cause for decades. For 30\r\nyears the United Nations operation in Cyprus has depended\r\non British troops and logistics. In the last five years British\r\nforces have served in Kuwait, Cambodia, Rwanda, Angola,\r\nGeorgia and, of course, Bosnia. Today Britain commits\r\nmore troops to United Nations peace-keeping than any other\r\nMember State — with 10,250 out of a total of 69,000.\r\nNear the end of its first half-century, the end of the\r\ncold war opened a new chapter for the United Nations.\r\nAfter years of super-Power stalemate, it again became\r\npossible to take effective action in the Security Council,\r\nincluding by authorizing the use of force to reverse\r\naggression. Almost immediately a rash of ethnically based\r\nregional disputes began to break out, from the former\r\nYugoslavia in the West to Central Asia in the East.\r\nEarly experience brought a sense of exhilaration.\r\nWhen Saddam Hussein made his foolish miscalculation and\r\nsought to wipe Kuwait off the map, the United Nations was\r\nthe means chosen to stop him, and it worked. Talk of a\r\nnew world order did not seem empty.\r\nFive years on, the record looks more diffuse. The\r\ninternational community could do little to halt disintegration\r\nin Somalia or to avert bloody collapse in Rwanda. The wars\r\nof secession in the former Yugoslavia have dragged on for\r\nfour years.\r\nBut those who speak of United Nations failure are\r\nwrong. The pendulum that swung too far towards euphoria\r\nafter the Gulf War has swung too far towards despair. Look\r\nat the facts.\r\nAlongside the torment of Bosnia and Rwanda are the\r\ndemocratic revolutions that have swept South Africa, South\r\nAmerica and Central and Eastern Europe. We live in a\r\npost-apartheid world, with a Europe of free nations and\r\nthe Middle East peace process a reality rather than a\r\nslogan. The United Nations has helped bring about peace\r\nin Namibia, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique and at\r\nlast, perhaps, in Angola. Even in Bosnia, the real good\r\nthe United Nations has done has been obscured by unreal\r\nexpectations. The reality of the past five years is not one\r\nof spreading world disorder, but of painstaking, steady\r\nefforts to build peace.\r\nCompare this record to the grim setting for the first\r\nGeneral Assembly meeting in 1946, when whole regions\r\nlay in ruins after five years of world war. The truth is that\r\nthe history of serious attempts at international cooperation\r\nis still quite young. The United Nations is by far its most\r\nsuccessful expression. There is today no one country or\r\ngroup of countries ready and able to cope with new world\r\ndisorder all alone, and since regional instability and\r\neconomic dislocation affect all our interests, we need a\r\nstrong and effective United Nations.\r\nThis is not to deny the need for change. But it is no\r\ngood simply blaming the Organization. We, the United\r\nNations Members, must meet our obligations to help\r\nimprove the system. We have done much in recent years.\r\nThe United Nations is better able now to plan, mount and\r\nconduct missions. Britain and others have seconded\r\nmilitary officers to New York to develop the planning and\r\noperational capability and funded secondments by other\r\nnations. Last year Britain helped launch a new initiative\r\non African peace-keeping. That is bearing fruit now, in\r\nUnited Nations regional training, in closer cooperation\r\nbetween African countries and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Conflict Resolution Mechanism and\r\nin products like the Anglo-French Peace-keeping\r\nGlossary, developed by the Ghanaian Staff College.\r\nThe process of reform must continue. The more\r\nseriously the United Nations addresses issues like pre-\r\nplanning, logistic support and command and control, the\r\nmore confidence troop contributors will have, the more\r\nforces will be put at the disposal of the United Nations\r\nand the more effective the operations will be.\r\nChanging procedures is not enough. We must learn\r\nto be more realistic in what we ask of the United Nations.\r\nThat means not setting aspirations we cannot provide the\r\nmeans to meet. Sometimes a declaratory statement is\r\nuseful to put the international community’s views on\r\nrecord, to underpin a consensus. At other times it may be\r\nbetter for the Security Council to remain silent than to\r\nissue unrealistic pronouncements.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nBosnia and Somalia have shown the limits of peace-\r\nkeeping. They offer a clear lesson. The United Nations is\r\nnot yet suited to fight wars. Peace enforcement is better\r\nleft, perhaps, to a coalition of the willing acting under\r\nUnited Nations authority. We must not send in the United\r\nNations to keep a peace which does not exist and then\r\nblame the United Nations for failure, nor send it in\r\nmandated and equipped to keep the peace and then blame\r\nit because it does not enforce the peace.\r\nWhatever the blemishes of recent years, there is\r\ngreater scope today for effective international action than\r\never before. The United Nations should be the centre-point\r\nof such work. I suggest we should focus greater effort in\r\nfuture on two areas.\r\nFirst, preventive action is better than cure. Far better\r\nthan containing or extinguishing a fire is stopping it from\r\nigniting. Bosnia is the most tragic example. Today the\r\nprospects for peace look a little stronger. I commend the\r\nefforts of Dick Holbrooke, supported by the Contact Group,\r\nto mediate between the parties, and the agreement reached\r\nin Geneva on 8 September. Many hard choices lie ahead for\r\nall sides before a final settlement is achieved. But we have\r\nmade a start. It is vital that all parties seize this chance for\r\npeace. Only political negotiations, not military force, can\r\nsecure that.\r\nBut the war has dragged on for three and a half years\r\nnow. Tens of thousands of people have been killed;\r\nmillions more have been made homeless. It will take years\r\nfor the wounds inflicted on that country to heal. Certainly\r\nthe suffering would have been many times worse without\r\na United Nations presence. When I was in Sarajevo last\r\nweek, the Bosnian Government told me how much it values\r\nthe work done by British and other forces to help the\r\npeople of Bosnia. But how much better for all these people\r\nif war had been avoided from the start. Perhaps much of\r\nthe damage and destruction might have been prevented by\r\ncloser international attention to the problems and tensions\r\narising from the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.\r\nWe have started to learn that lesson. The early\r\ndeployment of a small United Nations force in The Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia has helped to stop\r\nconflict from spreading there. Elsewhere the quiet\r\ndiplomacy of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe has helped defuse tension in Ukraine and\r\nAlbania; has nudged adversaries toward peace talks in\r\nGeorgia, Moldova and Chechnya. There are few headlines\r\nfor successes that avert fighting and save lives. But the\r\nheadlines of war carry a heavy price. Preventive action is\r\na wiser investment.\r\nMany routes exist. Britain and France have sketched\r\nout one model: to use the skills of diplomats, of soldiers,\r\nof academics and others to defuse tension and promote\r\ndialogue. The presence of aid workers, human rights\r\nmonitors, or United Nations envoys can help contain a\r\nbrewing crisis; and all credit to the United Nations\r\nrepresentative doing that in Burundi. We strongly support\r\nthe efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\r\nwork with the United Nations in preventive diplomacy\r\nand conflict resolution. The initiative on African peace-\r\nkeeping will help.\r\nSo many different actors can play a part. The crucial\r\npoint is not who acts but when. Early warning of a crisis\r\nand prompt action by the international community are the\r\nreal key to avoiding further tragedy of the kind we have\r\nseen in Bosnia.\r\nMy second proposal is for a new approach to peace-\r\nbuilding. To provide lasting security requires more than\r\ndiplomacy and military force. To build real peace we\r\nmust bridge the gap between our humanitarian work and\r\nour long-term development work.\r\nAid workers have grown used to coping with the\r\ndebris of war. In the past five years the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR) has given help to millions fleeing conflict:\r\nRwandans in Tanzania and Zaire, Afghans in Iran and\r\nPakistan, Liberians in Côte d’Ivoire and in Guinea. But\r\ntoo often we treat short-term humanitarian needs in\r\nisolation. Huge sums have been spent in humanitarian\r\nefforts in Rwanda, for example. But Rwanda’s long-term\r\nstability depends on rebuilding the structures of society\r\nand on civil rights; helping local communities to help\r\nthemselves, in areas from health and housing through to\r\nan effective judiciary.\r\nI suggest that two elements are key to a new\r\napproach.\r\nFirst of all, we must adopt a longer-term perspective\r\nin tackling immediate crises. Even when a cease-fire is\r\nholding, or elections have taken place, if the framework\r\nof society is shaky, a continued international presence can\r\noffer it stability until a government can cope. An abrupt\r\nend to a mission, by contrast, can be very destabilizing.\r\nIn El Salvador, for example, a small human rights team\r\nstayed on after the United Nations troops had left, to\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nprovide further advice and monitoring. Peace-keepers\r\nthemselves can help begin the work of reconstruction. The\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the aid\r\nagencies have been doing that for over a year in central\r\nBosnia, underpinning reconciliation between Muslim and\r\nCroat communities by rebuilding roads and hospitals and\r\nschools.\r\nI strongly support the thesis of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecent report: that we must go beyond electoral assistance,\r\nto preparing the social and institutional ground in which\r\ndemocracy and civil society can put down firm roots. The\r\ntask of rebuilding Bosnia could be a model for the future.\r\nSecondly, we need far better coordination in what we\r\ndo. If funds are to be gathered and used quickly and\r\neffectively, donors themselves must make a greater effort\r\nto meet their promises of help. Before operations begin, as\r\nplanning gets under way, the international financial\r\ninstitutions must be involved from the start, as they were in\r\nCambodia. All the actors in the United Nations system must\r\nbe working together, military and political, humanitarian\r\nand development, crossing the traditional boundaries\r\nbetween rival baronies. Such a coalition of interests could\r\nplug the gap we see too often now, until the major\r\nreconstruction programmes can begin.\r\nMr. Huaraka (Namibia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMy proposal is to build on these principles in United\r\nNations programmes for stabilization and transition. There\r\nare many areas where international expertise can help\r\nrestore a society; creating judicial systems; training an\r\narmy; developing a finance ministry or a diplomatic service.\r\nTo fulfil these needs, we should be prepared to loan our\r\nexperts to countries emerging from conflict, as Britain’s\r\nKnow-How Fund does for countries in Central and Eastern\r\nEurope emerging from communism. United Nations\r\nprogrammes for stabilization and transition could be the\r\ngreatest contribution we could make to international\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe demands on the United Nations have grown\r\nenormously. To meet them the United Nations needs\r\nchange at the centre too. I welcome work under way to cut\r\ncosts and reduce waste in New York. The whole United\r\nNations system must learn from that example. We need\r\nbetter planning and budgeting, an end to fraud and\r\nmismanagement. More subcontracting can help, using non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, even private companies, for\r\ntasks like mine clearance and logistics in Angola. And there\r\nis still too much duplication between the United Nations\r\nagencies. Rhetoric is not enough. Reform has to be real,\r\nand it has to be soon.\r\nThis is not a side issue. It is not a narrow interest.\r\nIf we are to do the United Nations work effectively —\r\npeace-keeping, aid or humanitarian — we must use its\r\nresources better. No one, G-7 or G-77, benefits from\r\nwaste. Recent experience has shown the United Nations\r\nis in some ways ill-fitted for its tasks; under-powered in\r\nsome areas, like peace-keeping and preventive diplomacy;\r\nbut, however, still bloated in other parts of the system.\r\nUnited Nations Members must pay their dues. But the\r\nUnited Nations must justify those funds, and get the most\r\nfrom them, by hard decisions on duplication and over-\r\nstaffing, and diverting resources to the top priorities.\r\nBritain supports enlargement of the Security Council\r\nto broaden its base without reducing its effectiveness.\r\nPermanent membership is the key issue. Permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council must be both willing\r\nand able to make a significant contribution through the\r\nUnited Nations to international security. That is what the\r\nSecurity Council is about. That is what it must remain if\r\nit is to be effective. Germany and Japan are playing an\r\nincreasing part across the range of United Nations\r\nbusiness, and are among the top three financial\r\ncontributors. It is right that they should benefit from an\r\nexpansion of the permanent membership, with the wider\r\nrights that entails, but also with the wider responsibilities\r\nto contribute to security and peace-keeping. Broad\r\ngeographical balance in an enlarged Council also needs to\r\nbe maintained.\r\nBut the United Nations system will never work if we\r\ndo not fund it properly. The United Nations is on the\r\nverge of financial collapse. It is owed over $3.7 billion in\r\nunpaid contributions. Troop contributors are owed nearly\r\n$1 billion. Last year 39 countries failed to pay at all. The\r\nUnited Kingdom favours tightening of penalties for non-\r\npayment, including the charging of interest on late\r\npayments. We find unacceptable cross-funding of regular\r\nbudget deficits from the peace-keeping budget. Perhaps an\r\nappropriate policy could best be entitled: No\r\nRepresentation without Taxation!\r\nThe financing arrangements must change. Some\r\nmembers pay too much. Others, like the new economic\r\ngiants of the developing world, now pay less than they\r\nshould. We need a scale that is simpler and reflects a\r\ncountry’s real capacity to pay, and without the additional\r\nanomalies and distortions of the present system. Britain\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nand Sweden have put forward ideas. We need progress\r\nsoon.\r\nBut the problem is not solved by turning the tap off.\r\nThis year we have all reaffirmed our support for goals and\r\nwork of the United Nations. But empty words will not pay\r\nbills.\r\nThe final lesson from the last 50 years may be the\r\nmost important: the case for a strong, effective United\r\nNations.\r\nIn conclusion, may I say that the United Nations today\r\nfaces a crisis of confidence. United States Congressmen\r\nmay be the most vocal sceptics. They are not alone. The air\r\nof optimism, of a fresh start after the cold war, is overtaken\r\nin some quarters by gloom at the instability and\r\nfragmentation around us, and pessimism at our ability to\r\ncope. This despair is dangerous.\r\nMultilateral action is not an add-on to national policy.\r\nIt gives wider legitimacy to principles we value, such as\r\nhuman rights and democracy. It spreads the cost of aims we\r\nshare, such as freeing Kuwait from invasion or restoring\r\ndemocracy in Haiti. It lets us work with others to fight\r\ncommon threats, such as greenhouse-gas emissions or the\r\ninternational drug trade.\r\nThe price is not high. The bill for all United Nations\r\npeace-keeping, all aid and development work last year, was\r\nslightly over 3.5 per cent of the United States’ defence\r\nbudget, or less than the United Kingdom spends on police\r\nand public administration. One day of Operation Desert\r\nStorm cost as much as all that year’s United Nations peace-\r\nkeeping. The price of disengagement and disorder would be\r\ngreater. Public support is there. Even in the United States,\r\npolls are clear: people support the United Nations, and they\r\nsupport international peace-keeping. We have a duty to our\r\nelectorates to continue the United Nations work.\r\nIt is easy to forget the United Nations successes over\r\n50 years. It is easy to turn away from disorder and chaos.\r\nBut the world is too small. Crises in distant countries affect\r\nus too; our commerce, our citizens overseas, our\r\nneighbour’s security — ultimately it is our own. It is in our\r\ninterest to play what part we can to build a more decent\r\nworld. If the United Nations were not here to help do that,\r\nwe would have to invent something else.\r\nThe experience of five decades offers lessons for the\r\nfuture. I know the Secretary-General is committed to\r\nchange. Getting the United Nations we need for the twenty-\r\nfirst century requires the support and participation of all\r\nMember States. The United Kingdom has played a full\r\npart in the United Nations for 50 years, and we will\r\ncontinue to do so.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nChairman of the delegation of Bangladesh, His Excellency\r\nMr. Reaz Rahman. I now call on him.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): I have the honour to\r\nmake the following statement on behalf of His Excellency\r\nMr. A. S. M. Mostafizur Rahman, the Foreign Minister of\r\nBangladesh, who, though present in New York, is unable\r\nto attend this Assembly for reasons of health.\r\n“I warmly congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral on his unanimous election as President of\r\nthis historic fiftieth anniversary session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. His election is a tribute,\r\nnot only to him personally, but to his great country,\r\nPortugal. I am confident that he will do great honour\r\nto the legacy of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\r\nAmara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, to whom we owe deep\r\nappreciation, not least for his sponsorship of the\r\nestablishment, on 14 September, of the Open-ended\r\nHigh-level Working Group on the strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\n“Let me also commend our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedicated and\r\nuntiring efforts to promote the effectiveness of this\r\nworld body.\r\n“In this fiftieth anniversary year, the United\r\nNations has reached a critical turning-point in\r\nappraising its past and in charting a viable course for\r\nits future, based on the renewed commitment, trust\r\nand consensus of its Member States.\r\n“The world of today is obviously quite different\r\nfrom that of 1945. Then, the United Nations, in the\r\nwake of the devastating global conflagration that\r\nwas the Second World War, was called upon\r\nto save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war\u0027.\r\nIn the wake of the cold war, the United Nations is\r\nnow called upon to consolidate and secure an\r\nuncertain and amorphous peace.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\n“The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that\r\nthe United Nations, freed from nuclear and ideological\r\nconfrontation, would devote its full attention to\r\nbuilding a peaceful and more equitable world; tackle\r\nthe challenge of world poverty; advance regional\r\nconflicts to resolution; distribute the benefits of peace\r\ndividends; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized\r\npremises of the Charter, especially with regard to\r\ncollective security.\r\n“These hopes were belied. The world of the\r\n1990s is more dangerous in many ways than the cold-\r\nwar era. There is greater tension in more places, a\r\nfurther degradation in the quality of life and many\r\nmore complex issues of law and ethics, management\r\nand practical cooperation. Negative impulses have\r\nassumed a variety of dimensions within States,\r\nbetween groups of States and globally.\r\n“Within States, nations have come under siege\r\nfrom multiple threats, retarding their capacity to act\r\neffectively or independently. Political instability has\r\nfuelled an economic breakdown, and economic\r\nbackwardness has created political upheaval in a\r\nnever-ending vicious circle. Long-suppressed national,\r\nethnic and cultural rivalries have resurfaced,\r\nunleashing bigotry, extremism and violence. They\r\nhave generated powerful centrifugal forces that have\r\nnot only threatened to but actually breached\r\nestablished boundaries. Demagogues, political\r\nseparatists and fringe groups are being encouraged and\r\nsupported by external forces to challenge the\r\nlegitimacy of Governments and their capacity to\r\ngovern.\r\n“On another plane, fears are surfacing that the\r\nbipolar world of the past 50 years could now assume\r\na North-South configuration, not between opposing\r\npolitical and social systems, but between rich and poor\r\nnations. Anxiety is increasing in the South that their\r\ninterests are being marginalized; that development\r\nresources are being diverted or are dwindling; that\r\ntheir potential to act as partners in revitalizing the\r\nworld economy is being ignored; and that new\r\nconstraints and conditionalities are being selectively\r\nimposed.\r\n“Globally, new forces are emerging that no State\r\nacting alone can control but which threaten the\r\nlegitimacy of all States. Pollution, eco-damage,\r\ndevastating diseases, speculative dealers and money-\r\nlaunderers, organized crime, arms smugglers and\r\nterrorists have eaten into all societies, vitiated values\r\nand crippled development. Rapid technological and\r\ntransnational processes are reducing the ability of\r\nStates to act on their own or to regulate domestic\r\npolicies affecting the movement of goods, services,\r\nlabour and capital. Tensions over resources are a\r\ncase in point. Forty per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation live on the banks of rivers or lakes\r\nshared by two or more countries. Dams and\r\nirrigation projects cause serious tension and actual\r\nconflict.\r\n“Ironically, at a time when the United Nations\r\nis in greater demand then ever before and its\r\ncapacity stretched to the limit, a serious campaign of\r\nvilification has been launched against it. It has been\r\ncharged with mismanagement, inefficiency,\r\ncorruption, excessive costs and over-staffing. Its\r\ngrowing membership, in the wake of decolonization,\r\nhas been termed irresponsible, obstructive and\r\ndivisive, and it has been accused of indiscriminately\r\nexercising the so-called tyranny of the majority\u0027.\r\nThis tarnished image, propagated by a few but\r\nrejected by many, has left deep scars that have\r\ndiminished the United Nations.\r\n“It is against this background that I now turn to\r\nsome of the priority concerns facing Bangladesh.\r\n“First and foremost is the financial crisis that\r\nthreatens to undermine the United Nations. The\r\nSecretary-General has declared that the United\r\nNations is already technically bankrupt. The\r\nfinancial situation has to be placed on an adequate\r\nand sustainable footing and its deterioration urgently\r\nreversed.\r\n“Bangladesh has consistently held that the\r\ncurrent financial difficulties were primarily a cash-\r\nflow imbalance due mainly to the failure by some\r\nMember States, in particular some major\r\ncontributors, to fulfil their Charter obligations in full\r\nand on time. These Member States must give\r\npractical effect to their commitment to the United\r\nNations by paying their assessed contribution in full\r\nand on time, including all arrears. Capacity to pay\r\nremains the fundamental tenet in determining\r\nMember States’ contributions. To proceed on the\r\nbasis that simply a revision of the scales of\r\nassessment would provide a panacea to all financial\r\nills is simplistic and misleading. It will neither\r\nchange the aggregate amount of revenues available\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nto the United Nations nor guarantee better cash flows\r\nor prompt payment. While it is likely that for some\r\ntime to come the bulk of United Nations revenues will\r\ncome from assessments and voluntary contributions,\r\nBangladesh supports exploring the possibility of\r\nproviding independent revenue sources for the United\r\nNations through various international transactions and\r\ntaxation.\r\n“Bangladesh supports the reform efforts that have\r\nbeen initiated to revitalize and restructure the main\r\norgans of the United Nations and to achieve a more\r\ndynamic interrelationship for them. We intend to\r\nparticipate actively and constructively in the open-\r\nended, high-level Working Group on United Nations\r\nreform which is to review the Secretary-General’s\r\nAgendas for Peace and Development, respectively, and\r\nthe report submitted by Member States and\r\nindependent commissions. While we support the idea\r\nthat the broad objective of the reform is to strengthen\r\nthe response and efficiency of the United Nations\r\nsystem in promoting the goals of development,\r\nsecurity, justice and equality and to improve\r\naccountability and responsibility, we reject pursuit of\r\nreforms of a purely mechanical or managerial nature.\r\nIt seems ironic that the yardstick for determining what\r\nshould or should not be pruned has been applied\r\nselectively in the past, with peace-keeping operations\r\napproved by the Security Council proliferating at the\r\ncost of development programmes. Catchwords of cost-\r\neffectiveness, financial stringency, trimming\r\nmanagement, redundancy, waste and inefficiency seem\r\nintended more to constrain control and reduce the\r\nUnited Nations role than improve its capability of\r\nresponding to the needs of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n“Our position with regard to Security Council\r\nreform has concentrated more on strengthening the\r\ntransparency and efficiency of the Council’s mandate\r\nthan on enlargement of the permanent membership.\r\nWhile we fully support enlargement of the overall size\r\nof the Council to reflect the growth in membership of\r\nthe United Nations, we believe that an increase in\r\npermanent members should be considered only on the\r\nbasis of the most stringent criteria, and on the basis of\r\nglobal recognition and consensus. We are opposed in\r\nprinciple to creating new centres of privilege or\r\ndistinctions that can distort the principle of sovereign\r\nequality.\r\n“Bangladesh welcomes the consensus achieved\r\nin the outcomes of the major conferences in Cairo,\r\nCopenhagen and Beijing on population, social\r\ndevelopment and women, which supplement the\r\nresults of the Earth Summit, the children’s Summit\r\nand the Vienna Conference on Human Rights.\r\nTogether they have forged a meaningful and\r\ncomprehensive social agenda that has reinforced\r\npoverty eradication and people-centred sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It must be emphasized, however, that\r\nsocial development is dependent on economic\r\ngrowth, which can be fuelled only in an international\r\neconomic environment which is conducive to it.\r\n“The global society is only as strong as its\r\nweakest link. The plight of the least developed\r\ncountries assumes special relevance and importance\r\nin this 1995 mid-term review year of the least\r\ndeveloped countries’ Programme of Action for the\r\n1990s. Their continuing crises calls for immediate\r\nremedial action especially in increasing official\r\ndevelopment assistance, writing off debts and\r\nassuring greater trade access on preferential terms.\r\n“Bangladesh has followed closely and supports\r\nstrongly the evolution and development of the\r\nSecretary-General’s Agenda for Peace. We agree\r\nwith the priority emphasis that has been placed on\r\npreventive diplomacy and conflict-prevention\r\nmeasures and recognize especially their cost-\r\neffectiveness. We believe that regional efforts and\r\nregional agencies should be utilized more frequently\r\nand their capacity strengthened. Bangladesh has\r\nactively contributed to the peace-keeping mission of\r\nthe United Nations and has always favourably\r\nresponded in providing troops. We have closely\r\nexamined and positively responded to the request for\r\nthe provision of stand-by troops. We are also\r\nfavourably inclined to support a rapid-reaction\r\ncapability for providing humanitarian assistance.\r\n“At plenary meetings the General Assembly\r\nwill have occasion to address in greater depth some\r\nof the most pressing and critical political issues on\r\nthe agenda, including the ongoing conflict in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, in which prospects for a\r\nnegotiated solution have considerably brightened on\r\nthe basis of the Contact Group’s Peace Plan and the\r\nGeneva Declaration of Principles of\r\n8 September 1995; the continuing peace efforts in\r\nthe Middle East and the new interim agreement\r\nbetween Israel and Palestinian leaders as a follow-up\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nto the Oslo Agreement; the status of democracy and\r\nhuman rights in Haiti; and the review of the work of\r\ninternational tribunals established in former\r\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda. Given the fluidity and\r\nrapid evolution of events in some of these crises, it is\r\nour hope to comment on them at length during\r\nconsideration of the specific item.\r\n“Let me say in conclusion that there is no doubt\r\nin our mind that the United Nations remains the only\r\nforum where we can meet the challenges of the future\r\nby drawing upon our combined solidarity and\r\nwillingness to confront them together. Bangladesh\r\nreaffirms its firm and unwavering commitment to this\r\nworld body and the pursuit of its great goals.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Finland, Her Excellency Miss Tarja\r\nKaarina Halonen.\r\nMiss Halonen (Finland): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his\r\nelection to the presidency of this fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that under his wise\r\nleadership we shall come to a successful conclusion of this\r\nhistoric session.\r\nMy Spanish colleague, Minister Javier Solana, has\r\nalready spoken on behalf of the European Union. I fully\r\nassociate Finland with his statement.\r\nFifty years ago the founders of the United Nations\r\nestablished the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity as the primary purpose of their new Organization.\r\nThey also undertook to take effective collective measures\r\nto that end. Fifty years later the condition of the world is\r\ndramatically different, but the United Nations is as\r\nindispensable now as it was then. Its role under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter continues to be a vital bulwark of world\r\nsecurity, but its mission of peace now ranges much wider:\r\nthe United Nations focuses on prevention of conflicts, it\r\nsustains development, it seeks to ensure the human rights\r\nand dignity of every individual.\r\nThe world needs a strong United Nations. Certainly\r\nthe small, the weak and the underprivileged among us need\r\nthe United Nations the most. But the United Nations, in\r\nturn, needs the full support of all its Member States.\r\nIt is intolerable that while all of us here will once\r\nagain reaffirm our faith in the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization is once more experiencing extreme financial\r\ndifficulties. In this context I should like to draw the\r\nattention of the Assembly to a statement adopted\r\nyesterday by the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic\r\ncountries — Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and\r\nFinland — on the financial situation of the United\r\nNations. The text of this statement will be made available\r\nlater.\r\nWe all agree that the United Nations needs to\r\nstreamline its work, set clear priorities and cut out\r\nactivities that have become obsolete. Yet the main reason\r\nfor the difficulties is that the majority of the Member\r\nStates, permanent members of the Security Council\r\namong them, do not pay their assessed contributions on\r\ntime, in full or without conditions.\r\nAs a consequence, those who pay on time, in full\r\nand without conditions — such as Finland — are in fact\r\npenalized for their behaviour. It is high time for all\r\nMember States to acknowledge that to pay one’s dues is\r\nnot an option, but an obligation, and that this obligation\r\nmust be fulfilled, and fulfilled punctually. When payments\r\nare not made on time, it is normal to charge interest. This\r\nshould be done also in the United Nations.\r\nIt is also clear that the present scale of assessments\r\nneeds to be revised rapidly to take into account the real\r\ncapacity to pay of each Member State. Finland is\r\nprepared to support adjustments in cases where the pains\r\nof transition, natural disasters or other circumstances truly\r\nbeyond the control of the Government concerned justify\r\nsuch exceptional treatment. On the other hand, upward\r\nadjustments should be the rule when economic\r\ndevelopment justifies them.\r\nA strong United Nations needs an effective Security\r\nCouncil, capable of acting on behalf of the entire\r\nmembership. Finland is pleased that the Security Council\r\nhas assumed its role under the Charter after the paralysis\r\nof the cold-war years. We also welcome the steps the\r\nCouncil has taken to improve its working methods and\r\nthe transparency of its deliberations.\r\nTo remain effective in the long run, the Security\r\nCouncil must be representative. There can be no\r\neffectiveness without legitimacy. Legitimacy grows from\r\na true reflection of the increase in United Nations\r\nmembership as well as from a frank recognition of\r\nchanging realities. Finland therefore supports an increase\r\nin Council membership by five to eight new members.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nThe groundwork for the reform of the Council has\r\nbeen laid after two years of intensive debate in the Working\r\nGroup of the General Assembly. Now it is time to move\r\nfrom discussion to true negotiation between Member States.\r\nA strong United Nations does not mean that our\r\nOrganization should do what we, as Member States, should\r\nin the first instance do ourselves. Under the Charter,\r\nMember States themselves have an obligation to seek\r\npeaceful solutions to disputes and to make every effort to\r\nprevent conflicts in advance. The United Nations assists,\r\nbut cannot replace, the Member States, nor should it be\r\nexpected to do so.\r\nThe permanence of, and unfailing respect for,\r\nuniversal norms is the basis of human security, whether in\r\nrelations between nations or within the nations themselves.\r\nThe historic decision by the parties to the Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty to make that Treaty permanent\r\nmeant that a cornerstone of international security was kept\r\nin place and that the prospect of the eventual elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons became more attainable. The next step\r\nshould be the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-\r\nban treaty by the summer of 1996. The negotiations in\r\nGeneva are proceeding well. Under these circumstances,\r\nany testing is therefore a cause for concern. Finland has\r\nexpressed its disapproval of the recent tests by France and\r\nChina.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe breakthrough achieved in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess two years ago will be followed by a new important\r\nagreement, to be signed this week. I should like to\r\ncongratulate the negotiators on their courage and\r\npersistence. The international community should continue\r\nto support the reconstruction that peace has made possible.\r\nFinland is encouraged by the recent turn towards a\r\npeaceful solution in the former Yugoslavia. The\r\ninternational community has shown resolve in defending\r\nSarajevo from persistent and cruel attacks on innocent\r\ncivilians. The international community must show equal\r\nresolve once the peace agreement is reached. It must help\r\nto maintain peace on the ground and to reconstruct what\r\nhas been shattered by war. But, above all, it is necessary\r\nthat all parties to the conflict now finally commit\r\nthemselves to peace.\r\nSome of the lessons from the conflicts in former\r\nYugoslavia and elsewhere are clear. The capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to\r\ncoordinate an international response is still inadequate and\r\nnot integrated enough, as so many speakers before me\r\nhave already mentioned here. The United Nations bears\r\nthe main responsibility to prevent, to react rapidly to and\r\nto manage often very complex emergencies. It is the\r\ncentral actor in peace-keeping operations. We must not\r\nallow the lack of financial resources and organizational\r\ndifficulties to stand in the way.\r\nA continuum of ideas based on a broad concept of\r\nsecurity — from respect for the rule of law and human\r\nrights to support for sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment — is already available in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s twin Agendas for Peace and for Development.\r\nIt is now for the Member States to put the best of those\r\nideas into practice. Finland, together with its European\r\nUnion partners, will do its share.\r\nTrue international security begins with the security\r\nof the individual, sometimes in relation to his or her own\r\nGovernment. Violations of human rights, including\r\nwomen’s rights, are not justifiable on any grounds. There\r\nare no cultural exceptions to universal human rights.\r\nThe importance of mechanisms for the effective\r\nprotection of human rights is now widely recognized. This\r\nis manifested, inter alia, in the efforts to establish\r\nsystematic and organized judicial inquiry into, and\r\npenalties against, violations of international humanitarian\r\nlaw and human rights. Finland supports the early\r\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\r\nIn addition to judicial mechanisms open mainly to\r\nStates, the question of the right of individuals to rely on\r\ninternational human rights instruments is worthy of\r\nserious study and development. The very positive\r\nexperiences gained during the 45 years that the European\r\nCourt of Human Rights of the Council of Europe has\r\nbeen functioning illustrate the merits of this approach to\r\nhuman rights. I can speak to that.\r\nThe Beijing Conference and other recent United\r\nNations Conferences — Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen —\r\nneed active and integrated follow-up throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system. The platforms are there. They\r\nhave established beyond doubt that sustainable human\r\ndevelopment and human security can be realized only\r\nthrough the empowerment of individuals and a strong\r\ncivic society under law. In the international follow-up of\r\nthe Beijing Conference, the roles of the General\r\nAssembly and of the Economic and Social Council are\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\ncrucial, not only for the efficient implementation of the\r\nPlatform for Action, but also for strengthening the\r\nOrganization in the social and economic fields. At the same\r\ntime, action at the grass-roots level — not new bureaucratic\r\nsuperstructures — is what is now required.\r\nThe follow-up to the Rio Conference offers some\r\nencouragement. Environmental concerns are now part of\r\nmainstream thinking on development. As a major forestry\r\nnation, Finland wants in particular to make sure that\r\nprogress on forest issues is made in a solid and balanced\r\nmanner and on a global scale.\r\nThe past five decades have demonstrated to the world\r\nthat the United Nations is a vital centre for harmonizing\r\nactions for the common good. The future will bring new\r\nchallenges. Let us provide the United Nations with the\r\npolitical support and the financial means that it desperately\r\nneeds to serve us for the future.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, His Excellency\r\nMr. Muhamed Sacirbey.\r\nMr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina): Let me first\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, and wish you success in your new,\r\nmost historically significant task.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations can be\r\nviewed as a time of retirement or as an opportunity for a\r\nnew beginning and rejuvenation. We all bear a\r\nresponsibility to maximize the possibility that the United\r\nNations will not only endure the next 50 years but will\r\nthrive as the centrepiece of a new world order and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is keenly aware of the pivotal\r\nrole into which our country has been thrust. It is not a role\r\nwe sought or one that we cherish. The successful settlement\r\nof the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, consistent with the\r\nprinciples of sovereignty, democracy and respect for human\r\nrights engraved in the United Nations Charter, can be a\r\ncatalyst for this new beginning for both Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the United Nations. However, a failure to\r\nhonour basic principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational humanitarian law could be fatal to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and threaten the vitality and integrity of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis coming Thursday, we all hope to see another firm\r\nstride towards peace in the Middle East. Although much\r\nmore needs to be done to secure the rights of all in the\r\nregion and to bring about real stability and therefore true\r\npeace, the peace process in the Middle East is anchored\r\nby leaders who deserve our respect. They represent\r\npeoples who have been long maligned during the recent\r\npast. The substantial differences that still exist between\r\nthese peoples are born out of previous injustices and out\r\nof conflicting claims to land.\r\nThe war waged upon our country does involve a\r\nland grab and an aggression in violation of the United\r\nNations Charter. However, more directly, the war is about\r\nideology — ideology not of religion and ethnicity but of\r\npolitics and tolerance. We have been the victims of\r\ngenocide and our enemy is not defined by its ethnicity or\r\nreligion but by the ideology of intolerance, dictatorship\r\nand fascism that it promotes.\r\nI have just come out of the negotiations with the\r\nmembers of the Contact Group on Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and my two colleagues from Croatia and\r\nSerbia and Montenegro. I wish that I could say that I was\r\nas confident about the prospects of success with respect\r\nto our negotiations as I am for the prospects of the\r\nnegotiations in the Middle East. While the Middle East\r\nnegotiations involve statesmen trying to resolve the\r\ncompeting claims of maligned peoples hungry for peace,\r\nwe find among our negotiating partners at least two\r\nindividuals already indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal\r\nin The Hague for genocide and other crimes against\r\nhumanity. While the international media show pictures of\r\nthe mass graves of civilians murdered in the campaign of\r\n“ethnic cleansing” and genocide that gave the Republika\r\nSrpska its very beginning, we are now negotiating with a\r\nteam that includes the very indicted war criminals\r\nresponsible for these murders and the mass graves.\r\nWe really do hope that this negotiating process will\r\nbring about a step towards peace. We have come to the\r\nfirm understanding that victory can be defined in more\r\nthan one way. We are not seeking military victory over\r\nour enemies, even though our legal and moral status is\r\nconsistent with absolute military triumph. We have\r\nlearned to define our victory in terms of the lives that we\r\ncan save and in the opportunity to rebuild and reinstate\r\nthroughout our country democracy and human rights. We\r\ncertainly do not seek revenge for the thousands of persons\r\nexpelled, tortured, raped and murdered. We only seek not\r\nto allow war criminals responsible for these crimes to\r\ndictate our future and to seek legitimacy through the\r\nnegotiating process. We do have confidence that the War\r\nCrimes Tribunal in The Hague will bring about justice\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nand will certainly know better how to address such war\r\ncriminals than the negotiators.\r\nWe are sincerely committed to, and do believe in, the\r\nnegotiating process. Negotiations are consistent with our\r\ngoal, which is to achieve peace, even if we have to make\r\ndifficult, painful compromises. Through peace we hope to\r\nre-establish democracy and respect for human rights\r\nthroughout the entire country and in that fashion gradually\r\nreintegrate our country. It is in many ways a risky and\r\nunprecedented road. None the less, we do believe that, in\r\npeace, the ideology of an open, free, democratic and\r\ntolerant society is strongest, while a closed, totalitarian and\r\nintolerant ideology is strengthened by conflict. We do\r\nrecognize also that there are some legitimate considerations\r\nthat have to be addressed in the negotiating process,\r\nincluding internal territorial delineations and means to\r\nrebuild the confidence of the population in the political\r\nprocesses and mechanisms that are designed to secure\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nOur country has been too scarred and too polarized by\r\nthis war for us to expect that peace and reintegration will\r\nnot require a special effort and mechanisms that may seem\r\nunnatural to many of us. None the less, there still remains\r\na basic contradiction in the existing negotiating process.\r\nThat is because it is theorized that dictators and despots as\r\nnegotiators on one side are truly prepared to negotiate to\r\nbring about free and fair elections and democratic\r\ninstitutions as the basis for a new Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThat is because it is expected that hate mongers on\r\none side are prepared to negotiate the establishment of\r\ninstitutions that in fact ensure respect for basic human\r\nrights.\r\nThat is because war criminals on one side — the same\r\nside — are called upon to negotiate the creation of\r\nmechanisms that would facilitate the return of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, the very victims that these criminals\r\nactually subjected to “ethnic cleansing”.\r\nI have just come from a set of lengthy and difficult\r\nnegotiations. The other side continues to refuse to accept\r\nthe requirement that the future Parliament and Presidency\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina should be elected by direct\r\nelections by popular vote.\r\nWe are being strongly encouraged — even pressured,\r\nif you will — to agree to what may be a process other than\r\nelection by popular vote as the means by which the future\r\nParliament and Presidency of our country would be\r\nselected.\r\nWe have already been lectured that the negotiating\r\nprocess would collapse if we persisted in demanding that\r\nthe extradition of war criminals to The Hague must be\r\nhonoured by all authorities within the future Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, as is consistent with international law and\r\nthe demands of the international community on our\r\ncountry as a whole.\r\nLet us be clear here once and for all on this. We\r\nwill not settle for sham elections or other selection\r\nprocedures in respect of our most basic governmental\r\ninstitutions that dictators and despots want in order to\r\nundermine real democracy and legitimize totalitarianism\r\nunder the cover of an international peace agreement.\r\nThe other side has been given the opportunity to\r\nchoose its own negotiating team. But the fact that they\r\nhave selected members who have already been formally\r\nindicted by the War Crimes Tribunal and others who may\r\nyet be indicted will not affect our demand that they be\r\nextradited to the Tribunal.\r\nThe selection of these negotiators is their choice. But\r\nlet me emphasize once again: we will not allow a\r\nnegotiating process to shield war criminals from\r\ninternational justice — not our justice, but international\r\njustice. In fact, the success of the negotiating process will\r\nbe measured by whether or not war criminals are brought\r\nto justice and by whether despots and dictators are swept\r\nout of power, not by the agreements that such criminals\r\nand dictators may sign.\r\nElections in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be\r\neither free, fair or democratic until a basic respect for\r\nhuman rights is established, until war criminals are sent\r\nfor trial to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, until\r\nrefugees and displaced persons are guaranteed the right\r\nand opportunity to return and to vote in these elections,\r\nand until overall conditions are established consistent with\r\na free and open society.\r\nFinally, neither can there be real peace unless an\r\nenvironment consistent with democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights is promoted by all, including the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWell, what does all this have to do with the United\r\nNations? It certainly has a lot to do with Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina as a Member of the United Nations. Simply\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nput, the United Nations Charter and basic international\r\nprinciples can be overlooked only temporarily. However,\r\nthe United Nations cannot be the envisioned authority in the\r\npreservation of international peace and security if the\r\nUnited Nations Charter is overwhelmingly ignored in\r\nestablishing the building blocks for peace. This is a\r\nuniversal principle with global application.\r\nAs I mentioned, I have just come from the\r\nnegotiations. I will be going back. We are surprised, we are\r\nangry that we have to negotiate over whether or not, in\r\nestablishing peace and a new beginning in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the other side will be forced to accept direct,\r\nfree and democratic elections. We are being told that we\r\nmust accept compromise language that means less than this.\r\nIf they will not accept the words today, we must be truly\r\nsuspicious of their longer-term intentions ever to accept real\r\npeace and democracy, or whether they in fact just intend to\r\nperpetuate their hold on power and domination over an\r\ninnocent Serb population.\r\nWe have already made many painful compromises.\r\nWe are prepared to make more — many more — in the\r\nsearch for a real peace. However, do not ask us — do not\r\nask yourselves — to settle for concessions to dictatorships,\r\nto intolerance, to illegality, to criminality and hate. Do not\r\nallow yourselves and us to set aside the most basic\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe are prepared to work with all Member States in\r\npartnership for that real peace and the necessary\r\ncompromises that all of us can live with.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Armenia, His Excellency Mr. Vahan Papazian.\r\nMr. Papazian (Armenia): Allow me to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. Given your talent\r\nand experience, I am confident that you will guide this\r\nsession to the successful completion of the noble mission\r\nentrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nI should also like to express my appreciation and\r\nthanks to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara\r\nEssy, for his outstanding leadership in accomplishing the\r\ntasks of the last session.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to extend my\r\nwarm welcome and congratulations to the Republic of Palau\r\non its admission to the United Nations during the past year.\r\nFurther, I wish to express Armenia’s gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, for the vision with which he has guided the\r\nOrganization, and for his tireless activity in redefining the\r\nrole of the United Nations in this changing world.\r\nAfter its declaration of independence in 1991,\r\nArmenia began implementing radical economic and\r\npolitical reforms to create a healthy market economy and\r\na truly democratic society. In addition to severe economic\r\nand social problems resulting from the extraordinary\r\nchanges buffeting the country, the transition process in\r\nArmenia has been exacerbated by the collapse of\r\ntraditional economic and trade arrangements, instability in\r\nthe region, the transport and energy blockade imposed by\r\nneighbouring Azerbaijan, the devastation caused by the\r\nmassive earthquake of 1988, the conflict between\r\nNagorny Karabakh and Azerbaijan and the presence of\r\n360,000 refugees.\r\nDespite such serious economic and social\r\ncircumstances, economic reforms have been continued\r\nand even expanded over the last year. From the point of\r\nview of current economic trends, 1994 was exceptional.\r\nThe programme of socio-economic development was\r\naimed at halting economic decline, reducing inflation and\r\ncreating conditions for the revitalization of the economy.\r\nAlthough the problems specifically related to the\r\ntransition remain, the measures taken not only have halted\r\nthe recession but also have provided a measure of\r\neconomic growth.\r\nIndeed, in 1994 Armenia became the first former\r\nSoviet Republic to record economic growth. A tight credit\r\npolicy has forced down the inflation rate from 30 per cent\r\na month last year to 1 per cent in August. The currency,\r\nthe Dram, is now one of the strongest in the region. Since\r\nmid-1994 a macroeconomic stabilization programme has\r\nbeen under way.\r\nWe have maintained a policy of fiscal and monetary\r\nresponsibility to encourage the development of the private\r\nsector. We are also undertaking a mass privatization\r\nprogramme to transfer nearly all State-owned enterprises\r\nto private ownership. We believe that the private sector\r\nwill be the engine of growth in Armenia and an important\r\nsource of employment opportunity. We welcome the\r\nparticipation of foreign investors in this process without\r\nrestriction, and we have a completely open foreign trade\r\npolicy.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nOf course implementation of our economic policy has\r\nbeen hampered by the situation in the energy sector, which\r\nremains critical. Therefore, the only viable, effective short-\r\nterm solution to Armenia’s energy crisis is the restarting of\r\nthe Metsamor Nuclear Power plant, which is under way.\r\nArmenia, like other States in transition, is in the\r\nprocess of emerging from economic crisis and of laying the\r\nfoundations for economic and social development. While\r\nStates have the primary responsibility to achieve social and\r\neconomic development, they cannot do so alone. They need\r\nthe substantial support and encouragement of the\r\ninternational community. Multilateral and bilateral donors\r\nshould coordinate their financing and planning procedures\r\nto improve the impact of their activity toward the\r\nachievement of the objectives of social development\r\nprogrammes of countries with economies in transition.\r\nGiven its universal membership and the unique and\r\ncomprehensive mandate reflected in its Charter, the United\r\nNations has a vital role to play in the development process,\r\nparticularly in ensuring the implementation of development\r\ncommitments in an integrated fashion. Hence, its\r\nrelationship with the specialized agencies, funds, regional\r\norganizations and commissions, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization should be\r\nanalysed with a view to enhancing effective action and\r\ncoordination between them in the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields.\r\nThe commitment to the transformation of the centrally\r\nplanned economy to a market economy is seen by the\r\nGovernment of Armenia as an integral part of the transition\r\nto a democratic State. In turn, a free-market economy will\r\nflourish in a stable democracy which promotes and\r\nunderpins economic development. The success of a\r\ndemocracy requires informed and civil discourse and\r\nrespect for the rule of law and for the democratic process,\r\nincluding the expression of the public view through free\r\nand fair elections.\r\nLast July, Armenia held its first democratic\r\nparliamentary elections since its declared independence.\r\nSimultaneously, Armenians voted in a constitutional\r\nreferendum on the first democratic institution in the history\r\nof Armenia. The Constitution was adopted and the liberal\r\ndemocratic forces gained an overwhelming majority in the\r\nnew parliament, now renamed the National Assembly.\r\nInternational and local observers reported that the elections\r\nran smoothly and were held in a free atmosphere. I should\r\nlike to take this opportunity to express my Government’s\r\ndeep appreciation for the monitoring activities of the United\r\nNations observers in the parliamentary elections and the\r\nconstitutional referendum.\r\nThe convincing victory of the liberal democratic\r\nforces has guaranteed the continuation of the political and\r\nsocio-economic policies pursued thus far by the\r\nGovernment, based on a clear programme and an\r\nachievable plan of development. The adoption of the\r\nConstitution is a decisive factor in the maintenance of the\r\nstability of Armenian statehood, as well as the legal\r\nguarantee for the development of a civic society and a\r\nmarket economy.\r\nDevelopment and human rights are interrelated and\r\nmutually reinforcing. There can be no genuine long-term\r\ndevelopment without respect for the full spectrum of the\r\nrights of individuals. Armenia strongly supports the\r\nefforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, Mr. Ayala Lasso. Member States must\r\ncontinue working toward better coordination within the\r\nHuman Rights Centre and consolidation of human rights\r\nfunctions within the United Nations system. The United\r\nNations should give priority to monitoring and prevention.\r\nArmenia considers self-determination in its multitude\r\nof manifestations to be an inalienable human right. The\r\nconflict between the people of Nagorno Karabakh, who\r\nare striving for self-determination, and the Azerbaijani\r\nGovernment, which refuses to address the rights of the\r\npeople of Nagorno Karabakh, continues to concern the\r\nGovernment of Armenia. The peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict remains Armenia’s top foreign policy priority.\r\nDespite the maintenance of the cease-fire since\r\nMay 1994, the conflict continues to threaten peace,\r\nstability and security in our region. The lack of any\r\nserious breakthrough in negotiations during this respite,\r\nthe uncertainties surrounding the political process and the\r\nreluctance of the international community to seize the\r\nopportunity to act firmly and decisively make the 15-\r\nmonth-long cease-fire highly fragile. Indeed, the longer\r\nthe cease-fire exists without any major developments, the\r\nmore likely the resumption of military activity in the near\r\nfuture will become.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\r\nimportant developments have taken place in the political\r\nprocess. Visible progress was made at the Summit\r\nmeeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE) held in Budapest in December 1994,\r\nwhen an agreement was reached at the highest levels to\r\ncombine the mediation efforts of the OSCE and Russia,\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nand create a co-chairmanship to guide the peace process.\r\nThe Summit also expressed readiness to establish a\r\nmultinational OSCE peace-keeping operation to consolidate\r\nthe existing cease-fire, make the peace process irreversible\r\nand open the way for the Minsk Conference.\r\nToday, under Russian and Finn co-chairmanship, and\r\nwith the participation of nine Minsk Group member States,\r\nthe OSCE is actively pursuing the peace process through\r\nintensive negotiations. While these efforts have certainly\r\nyielded results, a demonstration of political will by the\r\nparties to the conflict and an added commitment by the\r\ninternational community are needed if a serious\r\nbreakthrough is to be achieved.\r\nAs part of the step-by-step approach to the resolution\r\nof the conflict, the signing of the political agreement is\r\ncritical for the consolidation of the cease-fire and for the\r\noverall settlement of the conflict. This political agreement,\r\nwhich is currently, during the Minsk Group negotiations,\r\nbeing discussed by the parties to the conflict, stipulates the\r\ndeployment of the OSCE peace-keeping forces, the return\r\nof the occupied territories, the lifting of all blockades and\r\nthe return of refugees.\r\nThe successful conclusion of this agreement depends\r\nmainly on a provision that provides local, regional and\r\ninternational security guarantees that will ensure the\r\nphysical existence of the people of Nagorno Karabakh, and\r\neliminate the possibility of the resumption of military\r\nactivities. Such guarantees, along with standard security\r\nmeasures — deployment of OSCE peace-keepers,\r\ndemilitarization of all evacuated territory, and so on —\r\nmust also address Nagorno Karabakh’s legitimate need, as\r\nan indispensable security element, of a corridor linking the\r\nenclave with the outside world.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nposes a grave threat to both global and regional security\r\nand stability. At the 1995 Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the States parties\r\nundertook an in-depth and earnest review of the\r\nimplementation of the Treaty and reached a decision for the\r\nTreaty to continue in force indefinitely. My delegation\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate its\r\nsatisfaction with this historic outcome. Armenia attaches\r\ngreat importance to the early conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty — and no later than\r\n1996.\r\nIn recent years the United Nations has convened a\r\nseries of global conferences. The important process of\r\ninternational gatherings has continued this year. The\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development brought together\r\nmany strands that had previously been pursued separately.\r\nFor the first time in history there was a political\r\nacknowledgment that the eradication of poverty must be\r\nthe first priority of any society.\r\nWithin each of the United Nations global\r\nconferences, the advancement of women has been a major\r\nconcern, and we have witnessed a number of considerable\r\ngains on women’s issues. The Fourth Conference on\r\nWomen, which has just concluded in Beijing, both\r\nreaffirms the commitments toward the advancement of\r\nwomen made in the previous conferences and builds upon\r\ntheir achievements.\r\nThe Platform of Action agreed upon at the Beijing\r\nConference will lead to the creation of new machinery\r\nthat will help countries integrate women’s issues into\r\nnational policy-making.\r\nVirtually all Member States of the United Nations\r\nfavour an increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil reflecting the radical changes in the world and\r\nthe increase in the Organization’s overall membership.\r\nHowever, an increase in membership should not diminish\r\nthe Council’s efficiency. Meanwhile, the Security Council\r\nmust continue working to improve its openness,\r\ntransparency and communication with non-members. The\r\nCouncil should also be able to respond to emerging\r\nthreats and disputes before their escalation into armed\r\nconflict.\r\nThere is a direct link between peace and security, on\r\nthe one hand, and economic and social development, on\r\nthe other. Therefore, radical reform of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council is imperative. As a first step, strengthening\r\nof the Council’s policy-setting role and coordination\r\ncapability in operational activities for development is\r\nrequired. Together with improved coordination of United\r\nNations organizations and agencies devoted to economic\r\nand social progress, a strengthened Economic and Social\r\nCouncil could better assist the Security Council and\r\nadvise it of potential emergencies arising out of economic\r\nand social conditions.\r\nThe issue of financial resources is fundamental. If\r\nMember States wish to have an effective world\r\nOrganization to meet global challenges, they must pay\r\ntheir assessments, as they are legally committed to do.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nWe are not indifferent to the financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations, and I would like to assure the Assembly\r\nthat my country will do its best to fulfil its obligations.\r\nHowever, the current assessment formulas no longer fully\r\nreflect global economic and political realities. The High-\r\nlevel Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation\r\nof the United Nations was established by the Assembly in\r\npart in response to the necessity for revision of the\r\nassessment structure. The aim of a comprehensive financial\r\nreform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale,\r\nreflective of Members’ real capacity to pay, automatically\r\nadaptable to changed national circumstances and giving\r\nconsideration to the needs of countries with low per capita\r\nincomes.\r\nLet me conclude by wishing the General Assembly\r\nevery success in the demanding work it faces during this\r\nsession, and by pledging Armenia’s most active and\r\nefficient cooperation with the delegations of other States as\r\nyou, Sir, preside over our deliberations.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Portugal, His Excellency Mr. Jose\r\nManuel Durão Barroso, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Durão Barroso (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It will doubtless\r\nbe understood if, before beginning my statement, I express,\r\nas Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, the particular\r\nsatisfaction which I feel in seeing an illustrious fellow\r\ncountryman, Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral, an eminent\r\npublic figure and a professor at my alma mater, the\r\nUniversity of Lisbon, presiding over the work of the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Allow me to convey my\r\nwarmest and fondest congratulations to you, Mr. President,\r\nand, at the same time, my gratitude to all Member States\r\nfor the vote of confidence in Portugal that this represents.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to my colleague from\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Mr. Amara Essy, for the dedicated and\r\ncompetent manner in which he steered the work of the\r\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\r\nTo you, Mr. Secretary-General, I reaffirm my\r\nadmiration for the way in which you have carried out your\r\nfunctions during a period in which the United Nations is\r\nincreasingly called upon to intervene ever more actively in\r\nmany fields of international life.\r\nIn his statement, my Spanish colleague has already set\r\nout, in the name of the 15 States of the European Union,\r\ncertain positions which are also shared by Portugal.\r\nNevertheless, I would like to refer to some matters which\r\nare of particular importance to my country.\r\nPeace continues to be the primary objective of, and\r\nthe biggest challenge faced by, the United Nations.\r\nThe proliferation of peace-keeping operations\r\nlaunched by the Security Council in recent years and the\r\nhigh levels of human and financial resources committed\r\nto them are indicative of the commitment and collective\r\nefforts of the United Nations system and its Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe results achieved in some countries — and I am\r\npleased to refer here to the case of the United Nations\r\nOperation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) and the recent\r\ndevelopments in the peace process in Angola — are\r\nreason enough to indicate that we should not reduce our\r\nlevel of commitment nor the scope of our activities. We\r\nshould, however, also be flexible and creative, here as\r\nelsewhere, in order to avoid the rigidity of models and\r\nadapt peace-keeping operations to the specific conditions\r\nof each case.\r\nWhile it is true that the United Nations must not\r\nabdicate its mission of helping to restore peace, we\r\nbelieve that we should focus our efforts, above all, on the\r\nprevention of conflicts.\r\nThe Agenda for Peace requires effective coordination\r\nof the various Departments and agencies of the United\r\nNations system in order to provide an integrated view of\r\nthe many factors which contribute to the development of\r\ncrises. In the search for peace, the question of the\r\ncomplementarity between the United Nations and\r\nintergovernmental organizations of a regional nature is\r\nalso particularly relevant.\r\nWith this in mind, Portugal has actively supported,\r\nsince the beginning, the creation and implementation of\r\nthe mechanism for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution established by the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) at the Cairo Summit in 1993. We have also\r\nparticipated in the search for the means which will permit\r\nthe strengthening and efficacy of those instruments.\r\nAlong the same lines, while holding the presidency\r\nof the Western European Union (WEU) during the first\r\nhalf of this year, Portugal put the issue of conflict\r\nprevention on the agenda of that organization and focused\r\nthe need for WEU to develop support mechanisms in this\r\nregard.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nAlso, in the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE), where preventive diplomacy is the\r\nfoundation of its activities, Portugal has contributed so that\r\nthe Organization can continue to have a decisive role to\r\nplay in the maintenance of stability in a region which runs\r\nfrom Vancouver to Vladivostok. Alongside the security\r\nmodel for the twenty-first century, this will surely be one\r\nof the subjects that will receive in-depth treatment at the\r\nnext OSCE Summit, which will take place in Lisbon at the\r\nend of next year.\r\nWith regard to disarmament, as another of the\r\ncomponents of the efforts in favour of peace, Portugal\r\nwelcomes the historic decision taken by consensus on\r\n11 May this year in this very Hall to indefinitely extend the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nAlso encouraging is the progress obtained at the\r\nDisarmament Conference, especially with regard to the\r\nincreased expectations of rapidly completing a\r\ncomprehensive test ban Treaty.\r\nThe results of the high-level meeting, held last July,\r\nthat resulted in donations towards a voluntary United\r\nNations fund for de-mining should also be stressed here. In\r\nthat context, Portugal announced that it would be making a\r\nbilateral contribution.\r\nEqually, I welcome the negotiations currently under\r\nway in Vienna for the revision of the United Nations\r\nConvention on Conventional Weapons.\r\nThe enlargement of the Disarmament Conference is\r\nurgently required, keeping in mind the need for a\r\nstrengthening of the negotiation of international legal\r\ninstruments, as well as their observance by an increasing\r\nnumber of States.\r\nThere can be no peace in the world while large\r\nsections of the world’s population continue to live beneath\r\nlevels considered fundamental for human dignity. Integrated\r\nand sustainable development, focused on people, is\r\ntherefore the other great challenge which cannot be\r\nseparated from the search for peace. The Agenda for\r\nDevelopment and the Agenda for Peace constitute a single\r\nunit — one makes no sense, nor can it be achieved, without\r\nthe other.\r\nIn this context, it is necessary to recognize the need to\r\nrevise the entire system of international development aid,\r\nand to reflect on the role that, in this area, should fall to the\r\nUnited Nations. Ours should be a global and coherent\r\nvision.\r\nThe integrated and sustainable development which\r\nwe desire must be pursued on all fronts: at the economic\r\nlevel, to be sure, but also in the consolidation and\r\ndeepening of democratic institutions; in the promotion of\r\nhuman rights across the board; in the increasing\r\nparticipation of women in the most diverse sectors of\r\nsocial and political life; in the defence of the rights of\r\nchildren, ethnic minorities and all underprivileged\r\nmembers of society; in humanitarian assistance; and in the\r\nprotection of the environment.\r\nTo achieve all these goals, we must implement the\r\ndecisions taken at major United Nations conferences, for\r\nit is at these conferences — those of Rio de Janeiro,\r\nVienna, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing, as well as the\r\nforthcoming conference in Istanbul next year — that the\r\n“Agenda for Development” gradually takes shape.\r\nNon-governmental organizations, as well as other\r\ngroups through which the vitality of civil society is\r\ndemonstrated, are privileged agents in aid and\r\ndevelopment, and are our partners in the “Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”. This is due to their particular capacity of\r\npenetration in the field, of making contact with the people\r\nand of understanding their real needs.\r\nOf all areas of development, there are two in\r\nparticular to which I would like now to turn: the\r\nprotection and promotion of human rights, and the\r\nimportance of the environment.\r\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is a\r\nconstant priority of Portuguese foreign policy. We\r\ncontinue to believe in the importance of critical dialogue\r\nin order to reach the fundamental objective of respect for\r\nthose rights, and we are following the activities of the\r\nHigh Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights.\r\nThe fact that protection of the environment is\r\ninextricably linked to the notion of balanced development\r\nhas led it to gain an increasing relevancy in our foreign\r\npolicy concerns. In this context, I wish to refer in\r\nparticular to the oceans, especially with regard to the\r\ndevelopment of a balanced management of fish stocks and\r\nmarine resources.\r\nAs Portugal’s territory includes two archipelagos —\r\nthe Azores and Madeira — I would like to stress our\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nparticular sensitivity to the problems faced by small island\r\nStates in development and environmental issues.\r\nFurthermore, I express my hope that the International\r\nYear of the Oceans, a Portuguese initiative adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session, will provide an\r\nurgently needed opportunity for a full debate on these\r\nquestions. We will strive in that direction and hope that the\r\nholding in the same year in Lisbon of Expo 98 — an\r\nexposition on that subject — will result in a fruitful\r\ncoordination of these efforts.\r\nThe legislative activity of the United Nations in\r\nmaintaining the ecological balance and the management of\r\ninternational waterways is of special importance. Portugal\r\nintends to follow with particular interest the work on this\r\nissue that is being undertaken by the International Law\r\nCommission. We hope that in the near future a convention\r\non this matter will be adopted which would include\r\ninternational norms of responsibility — applicable under\r\ndomestic or international jurisdiction.\r\nIn the context of an “agenda for development”, I\r\nwould like once again, to underline my personal conviction\r\nand the position of Portugal that Africa must quite\r\nobviously be one of the priorities of the international\r\ncommunity. We were therefore pleased to welcome the\r\nannouncement made by the Secretary-General in Lisbon\r\nconcerning the launching of the “United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s”.\r\nThe forthcoming conference for the Great Lakes\r\nregion, convened under the sponsorship of the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\r\naddress the tragic situation of a number of countries of that\r\nregion, will certainly constitute a test of the true\r\ncommitment of the international community to the African\r\ncontinent: a test of the capacity to identify the objectives of\r\npeace and development; a test of the much-needed\r\ncomplementarity between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations.\r\nDespite the persistence of disturbing cases of political\r\nand social instability in a number of countries of the\r\ncontinent, as well as, of course, the open conflicts and\r\nserious violations of human rights which still continue, it is\r\nonly fair to recognize that in many African States\r\nsignificant steps have been taken towards the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflicts and the consolidation of the\r\nprocesses of political and social democratization.\r\nI am pleased to be able to say that the majority of\r\nthese processes were carried out under the aegis of the\r\nUnited Nations, and Portugal is proud to have actively\r\nparticipated in a number of them: in the international\r\nstructures of support to the process of democratic\r\ntransition in South Africa; in the negotiations which led\r\nto the Peace Accord in Mozambique, having been\r\nrepresented in all the commissions created by that Accord\r\nand in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique\r\n(ONUMOZ); and as part of the troika of observers of the\r\npeace process in Angola.\r\nWith this process in mind, I hope that, following the\r\nmeetings held at Lusaka, Franceville, and now Brussels,\r\nbetween the President of the Republic of Angola and the\r\nleader of UNITA, steps will continue to be taken towards\r\na definitive reconciliation of the Angolan family while\r\nstrictly complying with the Lusaka Protocol, which\r\nrestores the spirit of the Bicesse Agreement signed in\r\nPortugal in 1991.\r\nIt is equally important, keeping in mind Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1008 (1995), Lusaka Protocol be\r\nadequately encouraged by the international community. I\r\ncannot fail, therefore, to express my concern over the\r\ndelay in the deployment to Angola of all the forces and\r\ncontingents of the United Nations Angola Verification\r\nMission (UNAVEM III), where Portugal is already\r\npresent with a communications and logistics unit, as well\r\nas a number of staff officers in the command structure\r\nand civilian, military and police observers.\r\nThe tragic human suffering and the terrible material\r\ndestruction brought about by more than 20 years of\r\nconflict also require that the international community —\r\nfollowing the round table on Angola being held in\r\nBrussels under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme — continues to respond\r\ngenerously to the humanitarian aid needs and the\r\nchallenge of reconstructing the country, particularly in the\r\nareas of demining and the social reintegration of the\r\ndisplaced and the demobilized.\r\nThe New Agenda for Africa is pressing. It should\r\nlead to the promotion of vast integrated programmes of\r\ndevelopment aid which would coordinate, in the most\r\nefficient manner possible, the resources of the\r\ninternational community. It should seek to support and\r\nencourage African countries to choose the path of peace,\r\npolitical democracy, stability and social justice, respect\r\nfor human rights and economic development.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nThe strengthening of the ties which link Portugal to\r\nthe five Portuguese speaking countries is and shall remain\r\na constant goal of my country’s foreign policy.\r\nWhile talking of the ties that unite the countries that\r\nspeak Portuguese, I wish to underline the importance of the\r\nmeeting which, last July in Lisbon, brought together the\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe.\r\nThat meeting permitted the reaffirmation of purpose\r\nwhich motivates those respective Governments with regard\r\nto the institutionalization of the community of Portuguese\r\nspeaking countries. We hope that this next year will witness\r\nthe formalization of this community, which, to all intents\r\nand purposes, already exists in the hearts and souls of its\r\npeoples and has become more and more concrete in many\r\nways.\r\nAt a time such as this, when we are celebrating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and assessing its\r\nsuccesses and its failures, we cannot but, unfortunately,\r\ninclude the question of East Timor among the latter.\r\nThe 20 years which have passed since the illegal\r\noccupation of East Timor and the denial of the exercise of\r\nthe right to self-determination of its people, far from\r\nallowing the question to be forgotten and the status quo to\r\nbe consolidated have, on the contrary, worsened the\r\ntensions and focused ever more strongly the attention of\r\nworld public opinion.\r\nThe lesson of these last 20 years has been that force\r\nsolves nothing in East Timor nor will it ever resolve\r\nanything. Without a solution which, in conformity with the\r\nCharter and international law, takes into account the\r\nlegitimate rights of its people, including that of freely\r\nexpressing themselves on their political future, there will be\r\nno peace or respect for human rights in East Timor.\r\nI wish to reiterate here the commitment of Portugal\r\ntowards finding, through peaceful and negotiated means,\r\nsuch a solution. With that aim in mind, we continue to\r\ncooperate with the Secretary-General in the process of\r\ndialogue which, under his auspices, we have maintained\r\nwith Indonesia.\r\nDespite the fundamental difference which continues to\r\nseparate us on the core of the problem, we believe that the\r\nprocess of dialogue, with all its difficulties, registered very\r\nsignificant progress: representative Timorese personalities\r\nfrom various political sectors have now become\r\nassociated with this process.\r\nWe have always held that the rights and primary\r\ninterests at stake in this question are those of the\r\nTimorese people, and that their voice and their wishes\r\nwill have to be heard in order for a solution to be found.\r\nI sincerely hope that this first step marks the beginning of\r\na new, more positive and constructive phase of the\r\nprocess of dialogue concerning East Timor, one which\r\nwill lead us more quickly to the end of this tragic\r\nsituation.\r\nI turn now to Europe. The situation in the former\r\nYugoslavia continues to be a principal motive of concern.\r\nWe are naturally encouraged by the results obtained at the\r\nMinisterial meeting held in Geneva on 8 September,\r\ncongratulate the members of the Contact Group for\r\nobtaining those results and hope that the meeting being\r\nheld here today in New York will drive the process\r\nforward. At any rate, the consolidation of the results still\r\ndepends on keeping the international community united,\r\non the cohesion of the Contact Group, and on close\r\ncoordination of the initiatives and actions taken by\r\ninternational organizations. Portugal will continue to\r\nparticipate actively in these efforts and we shall maintain\r\nour presence on the ground while it remains useful and\r\nnecessary.\r\nIn its relationship with Latin America, Portugal has,\r\nas is well known, very strong human, historical and\r\ncultural ties: with Brazil, for reasons known to all, but\r\nalso with the other countries of Latin America, with\r\nwhich we are seeking an ever-closer relationship. Ties\r\nwith Latin America will always occupy an important\r\nplace in Portuguese foreign policy. This is made clear by\r\nour active participation in the Ibero-American Summits of\r\nHeads of State and Government.\r\nWe welcome the fact that Latin America is today\r\nclearly giving new value to its role in the international\r\nsystem. Portugal resolutely supports the projects for\r\nregional Latin American integration and, as a member of\r\nthe European Union, favours the establishment of wide\r\nagreements with institutions of regional integration —\r\nnamely, the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUL) and other processes of integration under\r\nway on the American continent. I am referring also to the\r\nconsolidation of the North American Free Trade\r\nAgreement (NAFTA) and the future establishment of a\r\nfree-trade area in the Americas.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nPortugal, both bilaterally and within the framework of\r\na number of organizations such as the European Union, the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\r\nWestern European Union, has promoted the strengthening\r\nand deepening of ties with the countries of the Maghreb, a\r\nregion of fundamental importance today for the security,\r\nstability and development of the entire Mediterranean area.\r\nTherefore, a number of European Councils, beginning\r\nwith that of Lisbon, have detailed new ideas and new\r\ninstruments of partnership that relate to a number of areas\r\nand that will bring closer together the two shores of the\r\nMediterranean; they will be decided upon at the\r\nforthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona\r\nin November.\r\nPortugal continues to follow closely the progress\r\nreached in the Middle East peace process, especially as\r\nregards the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.\r\nWe must pay tribute here to the courage with which both\r\nsides have pursued the path of peace; they have frequently\r\nencountered obstacles — sometimes tragic ones — but they\r\nhave not remained hostage to them. Proof of this is the\r\nimportant accord to be solemnly signed in Washington in\r\njust a few days. I hope that this atmosphere of dialogue will\r\nalso be consolidated among the other parties.\r\nPortugal, both within the European Union and\r\nbilaterally, has contributed to the assistance for the\r\nPalestinian people and for the support of its structures.\r\nTurning to Asia, I must first mention with satisfaction\r\nthat, as a result of the close cooperation between Portugal\r\nand China and in full respect for the joint declaration\r\nbetween those two countries, the process of Macau’s\r\ntransition continues to be carried out in a harmonious\r\nmanner. The common objective of both countries in this\r\nprocess remains constant: to guarantee the stability and\r\nprosperity of that territory and the maintenance of its\r\nspecial characteristics, in the framework of the transfer of\r\nadministration in December 1999.\r\nPortugal recognizes the increasing importance that the\r\nAsian continent is assuming on the international stage. My\r\ncountry feels that it has profound historical and cultural ties\r\nto that region. In this context, my Government hopes that\r\nthe meeting planned for next March in Bangkok will\r\nconstitute a significant step towards an ever-more-open and\r\nwider dialogue on all questions of mutual interest to the\r\nEuropean Union and Asia.\r\nTo achieve the fundamental and primary goals of\r\npeace and development, and to face the situations I have\r\nreferred to, the Organization must undertake a realistic\r\nexercise of self- examination.\r\nIt is, above all, essential for the Organization to have\r\na sound financial foundation. I do not believe I am\r\nexaggerating by stating that we are in the midst of a crisis\r\nthat is without precedent and that, if not promptly and\r\nbravely addressed, will surely lead the Organization to\r\nrupture. At this point, two stages appear available to us in\r\nthe search for a solution: strict payment in full and on\r\ntime of our obligations; the need for corrections which\r\nwill permit a reduction of expenses or their fairer\r\ndistribution amongst us.\r\nWith regard to the first point, I cannot avoid\r\ncriticizing the attempts to renege on commitments which\r\nhave already been made, by consensus. How can an\r\nexpense be adopted by consensus but its payment\r\nrefused? What kind of credibility can then be expected in\r\nwhat concerns international commitments?\r\nAs to the second aspect, reforms are necessary that\r\nwill reflect each State’s capacity to pay and the alterations\r\nto that capacity. In this spirit, my Government,\r\nresponding to an appeal made by the Secretary-General,\r\ntook the initiative earlier this year to increase voluntarily\r\nits contributions to the peace-keeping budget. Thus we\r\nhave moved from group C to group B on the scale of\r\nassessments. The decision will mean a five-fold increase\r\nin our initial contributions. We took this decision because\r\nwe consider that it is a step in the right direction in what\r\nconcerns the financial reform of the Organization. We\r\ntook this decision to express our commitment to the\r\nimportance and success of the work of this Organization.\r\nWe took this decision because we knew this increase\r\nmight benefit other countries that are experiencing\r\ntemporary difficulties. We hope that our move will be\r\nfollowed by other States whose economic situation has,\r\nlike Portugal’s, improved in recent years.\r\nIt is not merely in the financial area that the United\r\nNations must contemplate reform. Equally important is\r\nthe reform of the Security Council, which must in the\r\nnear future reflect the political, economic and\r\ndemographic realities of the contemporary world. In this\r\ncontext, an adequate and balanced representation of all\r\nregions of the world would confer on the Council greater\r\nefficacy in the formulation and implementation of its\r\ndecisions and would make it the beneficiary of wide\r\nsupport from all Member States, which would, in this\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 26 September 1995\r\nmanner, feel duly represented on it. It is undoubtedly a\r\ncomplex process, an evolutionary one, in which differences\r\nremain profound and which will necessarily be based on a\r\ncompromise solution.\r\nI cannot conclude without reaffirming here the\r\ncandidature of Portugal for one of the two non-permanent\r\nseats on the Security Council attributed to the Western\r\nEuropean Group for the period 1996 through 1997. Our\r\ncandidature is based on a number of reasons.\r\nFirst, because we believe, as a country with a\r\nuniversalist nature accustomed to contact with all regions of\r\nthe globe for more than five centuries and to understanding\r\nand accepting different cultures and civilizations, that we\r\nwill be able to contribute to the search for solutions in strict\r\ncompliance with the purposes and principles set out in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, having been only once before a member of\r\nthe Security Council, we understand that countries like\r\nPortugal have not only the right, but also the duty, to\r\nparticipate in that body more regularly.\r\nIn this context, I would like to underline here the\r\nsituation of countries like Portugal — in fact, the majority\r\nof those represented here — that, based on democratic\r\nprinciples such as that of rotation, can, wish to, and should\r\nbe able to, contribute to international peace and security.\r\nAnd this they can do in a particularly constructive manner,\r\nas, by not pursuing geo-strategic interests of hegemonic\r\nregional promotion or of any other type, they can, on the\r\ncontrary, contribute by being accessible, available and\r\nmoderate in the search for compromise solutions.\r\nOn the other hand, through our participation in peace-\r\nkeeping operations, our voluntary increase of our financial\r\ncontributions to the Organization, our participation in\r\nimportant United Nations organs, we consider that we are\r\nready to carry out the role which we may be called upon\r\nto play.\r\nWe are ready to listen and not to impose. We place\r\nour trust in negotiation and not on pressure; we support\r\nwhat is fair and balanced, and do not consider any\r\nformula which does not seek to build bridges for the\r\ncreation of consensus solutions.\r\nIn candidatures such as this, to achieve the goals set\r\nout, some are tempted to adopt attitudes which are of\r\ngreat visibility, but which are of a merely superficial\r\nnature. Others are tempted also to promise that which is\r\nquickly forgotten, or even to make commitments which in\r\nthe end are unfulfilled.\r\nOn our part, we prefer to rely on the inherent merits\r\nof our candidature and, in this context, to actively pursue\r\nin a committed manner, the defence of our positions,\r\nideas and proposals.\r\nWe believe, therefore, in the support and warm\r\nwelcome that the candidature of Portugal for the Security\r\nCouncil will receive in the elections to take place during\r\nthe next session of the General Assembly.\r\nNext month we will celebrate at the highest level, in\r\na solemn session, the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, which will provide an opportunity for reflection\r\non the future of this Organization. Portugal hopes that a\r\nstrengthened determination of all Member States will\r\nemerge to reaffirm the principles and values of the\r\nCharter and result in the better adaption of the\r\nOrganization to the complex realities of international life\r\ntoday.\r\nThis is certainly a great challenge. New generations\r\nhope that we will be able to face these responsibilities.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
