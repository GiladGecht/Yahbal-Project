(Portugal)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Zhan Videnov, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Bulgaria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria.\r\nMr. Zhan Videnov, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Zhan Videnov, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Videnov (Bulgaria): Allow me first of all to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe fiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nYour election is a clear recognition of the high esteem your\r\ncountry justly enjoys as an important link between different\r\ncultures and continents. This in turn has enabled Portugal\r\nto become an active partner of those countries, like\r\nBulgaria, that are progressing towards democracy and a\r\nmarket economy within a united Europe.\r\nIn today’s world of profound change the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations is of significance above\r\nall as a vantage point from which to try to develop a\r\nvision for the future.\r\nSituated at the historical crossroads of nations and\r\ncivilizations, Bulgaria today is seeking both to contribute\r\nto the successful redefinition of the United Nations role\r\nin the world of tomorrow and to ensure its own national\r\nsecurity and wellbeing. The role of the United Nations\r\nshould be above all to build upon the enhanced capacity\r\nof the Organization in three crucial spheres of its\r\nactivities, namely, conflict settlement and peace-keeping,\r\npost-conflict peace-building, and the laying of durable\r\nfoundations for lasting peace.\r\nToday we all recognize the emergence of a great\r\nnumber of new challenges to peace and security marked\r\nby extraordinary diversity and complexity. The conflict\r\nstill raging in the former Yugoslavia has been a traumatic\r\ntest of the key United Nations responsibility for conflict\r\nsettlement and peace-keeping. The disappointments in this\r\nregard have been many and profound; yet we should all\r\nface up to the simple truth that our Organization can be\r\nonly as effective as a guarantor of peace as we Member\r\ncountries wish and permit it to be.\r\nBulgaria has from the outset strictly adhered to\r\npolicies supporting a peaceful settlement under United\r\nNations auspices. Unilaterally, it has adopted and\r\nconsistently abided by the principle of non-interference in\r\nthe conflict. It has chosen not to become involved, either\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in any type of military activities on\r\nthe territory of the former Yugoslavia, including\r\nparticipation in United Nations peace-keeping. We have\r\ncalled upon the other countries in the region to exercise the\r\nsame restraint. On the other hand, throughout the conflict\r\nBulgaria has supported every international initiative aimed\r\nat achieving a peaceful, balanced, just and comprehensive\r\nsolution.\r\nIn keeping with its obligations under the United\r\nNations Charter and as a means of restarting negotiations,\r\nBulgaria has consistently implemented the international\r\nsanctions regime. This step was taken on the basis of a\r\nnational consensus that, despite the heavy burden such\r\nsanctions created for Bulgaria, it was our duty to implement\r\nthem as a dependable member of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nYet Bulgaria has sustained debilitating losses as a\r\nresult of the sanctions. Over the past few years, we have\r\nrepeatedly drawn attention to this problem, both as it\r\nconcerns Bulgaria and as it concerns cooperation with other\r\naffected States. The sanction-induced losses so far amount\r\nto well over 25 per cent of Bulgaria’s estimated gross\r\ndomestic product for 1995. This has made Bulgaria by far\r\nthe country most seriously affected.\r\nBulgaria’s policies favouring a peaceful outcome have\r\nhelped to establish it as a stabilizing factor in a most deeply\r\ntroubled region of Europe. At the same time, we feel that\r\nsuch recognition also contributes to enhancing the peace-\r\nmaking potential of the United Nations itself. Positive\r\ninteraction between the policies of individual Member\r\nStates and the decisions and measures of the world\r\nOrganization is the decisive factor in enhancing the latter’s\r\nkey mission, that of helping to settle conflicts and keep the\r\npeace.\r\nHowever, Bulgaria’s experience also shows that in\r\norder to discharge this mission successfully in the future the\r\nUnited Nations needs carefully to rethink its main peace-\r\nkeeping instruments, such as economic sanctions and peace-\r\nkeeping missions.\r\nIn areas outside its immediate vicinity Bulgaria has in\r\nrecent years contributed ground forces and civilian and\r\npolice observers. In the operation in Cambodia, generally\r\nconsidered a success, several young Bulgarians lost their\r\nlives. We sympathize with other countries that have\r\nsustained human losses in subsequent missions, including\r\nthe latest in the former Yugoslavia. We therefore strongly\r\nsupport the view that there is a need to reform and improve\r\nthe ways in which such missions are planned and\r\nexecuted, with priority given to enhancing the safety of\r\nUnited Nations personnel.\r\nRecently, mediation between parties to a given\r\nconflict has been successfully utilized in the discharge of\r\nUnited Nations conflict-settlement missions. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the agreement reached between\r\nneighbouring Greece and the Republic of Macedonia as\r\na most important step towards lessening tensions in the\r\nwhole of southeastern Europe.\r\nA further major contribution in this regard should be\r\nactive United Nations support for and collaboration in\r\nbringing to a successful conclusion the present intensive\r\nefforts to attain peace in Bosnia. Bulgaria welcomes the\r\nUnited States peace initiative and the efforts to implement\r\nit in close cooperation with the United Nations and the\r\ncountries in the Contact Group. This has opened up real\r\npossibilities for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\r\nExperience derived from the Yugoslav crisis\r\nhighlights the importance of another crucial United\r\nNations function, namely, post-conflict peace-building.\r\nToday, it is obvious that although negotiations have not\r\nyet achieved a final settlement there is a need to begin to\r\naddress the problems of post-conflict peace-building\r\nwithout delay.\r\nOne set of such problems concerns the reduction of\r\nthe levels of armaments and armed forces. It is clear that\r\nconflict settlement would be pointless were it not\r\naccompanied by a set of actions designed to remove the\r\nsources of real or potential security threats in the area.\r\nThus, in the arms-control field Bulgaria shares the\r\nview that the establishment of a future harmonized arms-\r\ncontrol regime in Europe should combine measures of\r\nboth a pan-European and a regional character. Such\r\nmeasures should be based on the understanding that\r\nsecurity must be indivisible and that any disproportionate\r\nconcentration of armaments, in particular when coupled\r\nwith a lack of control mechanisms, undermines security\r\nand stability. Therefore, the establishment of a credible\r\nsystem of arms control and confidence- and security-\r\nbuilding measures for the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia, as part of and in line with the pan-European\r\nregimes, must be an essential part of a comprehensive\r\npost-war settlement. Relevant international bodies such as\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) should play a very\r\nimportant role in this respect. The main objective should\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nbe to attain levels of armaments that will preclude once and\r\nfor all any temptation to use force.\r\nThe second set of peace-building measures concerns\r\npost-conflict economic reconstruction and stabilization.\r\nImportant work has been done at the United Nations\r\nin the past several years for developing an integrated\r\napproach to successfully implementing reconstruction\r\nprogrammes. Such an approach should encompass four\r\ninterrelated aspects: strategic issues of reconstruction, needs\r\nand capabilities, post-conflict reconstruction framework and\r\nmobilization of resources.\r\nToday plans for reconstruction are being laid for parts\r\nof the conflict area in the former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria is\r\nparticularly well placed to contribute to such plans. This is\r\nso for a number of reasons: first, its long-standing\r\nrelationship with the countries in and around the conflict\r\narea and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced and\r\ndurable political settlement; secondly, because of the\r\nexperience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with a\r\nlong record of practical work in the area; thirdly, acquired\r\nknowledge and expertise in working with international\r\nfinancial institutions in implementing programmes for\r\nreconstruction and development. For all these reasons,\r\nBulgaria could be an important factor contributing to the\r\nsuccess of any reconstruction effort in the area.\r\nThe emerging pattern of structured coordination\r\nbetween various organizations within and outside the United\r\nNations system provides guidelines and a very useful\r\nexample to follow. It encourages our own thinking as we\r\nstart exploring practical and institutional possibilities for\r\ncontributing to the concerted international efforts in this\r\nrespect.\r\nAt the same time, Bulgaria has every reason to expect\r\nalso to receive a part of the international post-conflict\r\nassistance for the region. Effectively building the peace in\r\nthe region requires that neighbouring countries that bore the\r\nbrunt of sanctions and have sustained inordinate losses be\r\nincluded on a priority basis in the list of recipients of\r\ninternational assistance.\r\nBulgaria’s concerns over the subject of sanctions have\r\nalready become well known. We have formulated them in\r\nextenso on several occasions. In fact, the international\r\ncommunity and, in particular, the General Assembly have\r\nrecognized the right and the need to include non-target third\r\ncountries in programmes for reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment. At its two previous sessions, on Bulgarian\r\ninitiatives, the General Assembly adopted by consensus\r\ntwo resolutions on this set of issues. This year again, my\r\ndelegation intends to submit a corresponding draft\r\nresolution which I hope will receive universal support.\r\nAt this point, I cannot but underline the findings and\r\nrecommendations contained in the report (A/50/60) of the\r\nSecretary-General entitled “Supplement to An Agenda for\r\nPeace” and, in particular, his conclusion that the price of\r\nsanctions implementation should be borne equally by all\r\nMember States and not only by those who have had the\r\nmisfortune of being neighbours or important economic\r\npartners of a sanctions target country. I would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to commend especially the efforts of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in this particularly\r\nimportant field of United Nations activities.\r\nIt is our view that, as a result of work already done,\r\ntoday there exists a significant scope of agreement on the\r\nways and means for overcoming the specific economic\r\nproblems confronting the affected States, as reflected in\r\npart IV of resolution 47/120 and resolutions 48/210 and\r\n49/21 A of the General Assembly. Bulgaria is\r\nparticipating, and will continue to do so, in an effort to\r\nhelp towards the successful completion of the discussion\r\non these issues in the United Nations.\r\nTogether with conflict settlement and post-conflict\r\npeace-building, a third, parallel line of action should be\r\nundertaken without delay. It should focus on laying\r\ndurable foundations for lasting peace through economic\r\nand social development. The task of achieving durable\r\nstability and security regarding peace and economic\r\ndevelopment has always been of particular relevance in\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe. It has become all the more so in\r\nthe light of evolving European integration.\r\nIn order to boost such development and lasting\r\nstability, there is an urgent need for concerted efforts by\r\nthe international organizations and specialized agencies\r\nwithin the United Nations system, coupled with broader\r\nand more intensive cooperation at a regional level. It is\r\ndoubtless necessary to avoid overlapping and duplication.\r\nYet a mechanism must be put in place for effectively\r\ncoordinating programmes for early implementation of\r\nachievable objectives.\r\nThe Ministerial Conference on environment for\r\nEurope, which is going to be held in Sofia the last week\r\nof this October, is a particularly apt example of this\r\napproach. Another initiative along these lines is the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\n(OSCE) seminar on the role of trans-European\r\ninfrastructure for stability and cooperation in the Black Sea\r\nregion, which will also take place in Sofia, a month later.\r\nIt will be dealing with priority projects for developing\r\nregional transport, telecommunications and energy\r\ninfrastructure as factors both for economic growth and for\r\nlasting stability and peace in the area.\r\nThe above forums could provide valuable inputs for\r\nthe work undertaken within the European Union with the\r\naim of elaborating a comprehensive regional strategy for\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe. Such a strategy could be based on\r\nthe approach embodied in the measures accompanying the\r\nPact on Stability in Europe, put forward at the time by the\r\nUnion. Cooperation at the subregional level may also prove\r\nto be a factor of significant practical importance in this\r\ncontext.\r\nFor its part, Bulgaria, in the course of the past several\r\nmonths, has attempted to develop thinking and proposals\r\nfor regional stability, security and cooperation which could\r\ninteract with initiatives and programmes developed by\r\nEuropean and international institutions and major world\r\npartners. It is our belief that developing the economic\r\ndimensions of regional security will greatly favour the\r\novercoming of local tensions rooted in the past, as well as\r\nthe full-fledged implementation of the basic principles of\r\nrelations between States under the Helsinki Act and the\r\nParis Charter.\r\nWith a view to promoting such regional cooperation,\r\nI would like to state from this lofty rostrum that Bulgaria\r\nis ready to host a gathering of interested Central and South-\r\nEastern European States at the governmental level in the\r\ncourse of 1996. Given careful preparation and the support\r\nof the international community, such a high-level meeting\r\ncould become a major step towards lasting security and\r\nstability in a historically much-troubled part of Europe.\r\nThe parameters of the new international system are\r\nstill taking shape today. What is positive is that in the days\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations the\r\ninternational community is looking for pragmatic and\r\nresponsible approaches to lend new meaning to the\r\nOrganization’s mission. The discussion of the possibilities\r\nof and prospects for United Nations restructuring can draw\r\non the accumulated wealth of experience and take\r\nadvantage of the prevailing spirit of cooperation. Let us\r\nmake the best possible use of them and together venture\r\ninto the new century stronger, wiser and more united.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria for the statement he has just made and for his\r\npersonal references to me and my country.\r\nMr. Zhan Videnov, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Bulgaria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Vice\r\nChancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Klaus Kinkel, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Kinkel (Germany) (spoke in German; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Please accept my warm\r\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. At the same time,\r\nI wish to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Essy, for\r\nhis successful work.\r\nThe United Nations 50 years on — that makes this\r\nsession of the General Assembly an event of extra-special\r\nsignificance. The people of the world have high\r\nexpectations. We must take stock, but in so doing we\r\nmust, above all, look to the future.\r\nThe representatives of 50 nations who assembled in\r\nSan Francisco in the year 1945 were intended to be, as\r\nPresident Truman put it, “the architects of a better world”.\r\nWhat has become of their blue-print?\r\nToday the family of nations has 185 members.\r\nMillions of people all over the world owe their lives, their\r\nfreedom and their health, their jobs and their homes, to\r\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies.\r\nDecolonization has been completed, apartheid has been\r\novercome, and respect for human rights is no longer an\r\ninternal affair. In the field of disarmament a historic\r\nbreakthrough has been achieved: in May of this year the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons was halted. That\r\nconstitutes a big step towards making the world safe for\r\nmankind.\r\nAll these are considerable achievements which many\r\ncritics of the United Nations have overlooked in this\r\njubilee year, achievements on which you, in particular,\r\nMr. Secretary-General, and your staff are to be\r\ncongratulated. Indeed, the United Nations, in spite of\r\nsome unjustified criticism, can take pride in what it has\r\ndone for the cause of peace, freedom and human dignity.\r\nEspecially worthy of our gratitude and appreciation\r\nare the more than 68,000 United Nations troops currently\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nserving on missions in all regions of the world. When\r\nservicemen from Asia, Africa or Latin America attend to\r\nthe basic needs of refugees in Europe, in the former\r\nYugoslavia, and keep the beleaguered people from starving,\r\nthen that is, I believe, a marvellous indication that the “one\r\nworld” is a reality. Lest we forget: nearly 5,000 of those\r\ntroops, the Blue Helmets, have been killed or wounded in\r\nthe line of duty. The Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel must be put into effect as\r\nsoon as possible. This we owe to all those who serve the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs we recap the events of the past year, we also have\r\nto consider the huge problems now confronting the world\r\nOrganization. The ability to safeguard peace: that is the\r\nworld’s main criterion when judging the United Nations.\r\nAnd here we have reached a critical point.\r\nSomalia, Rwanda and Bosnia: these countries stand for\r\ndisappointment and setbacks as well. However, I should\r\nlike to make it very clear that in such cases the culprit is\r\nquickly found, too quickly. Nothing is more convenient\r\nthan to point to the alleged inefficiency of the United\r\nNations. And nothing could be further from the truth.\r\nWhen it has not been possible to help people, when\r\nUnited Nations troops have been humiliated in the former\r\nYugoslavia, it has in nearly every instance not been the\r\nfault of the United Nations. The problems have lain in its\r\nunsatisfactory mandate, in the lack of political will on the\r\npart of Member States, and, unfortunately, in the shortage\r\nof funds. It is we, the Members, who cause the difficulties.\r\nFollowing the holding of United Nations troops as\r\nhostages, the atrocities in Zepa and Srebrenica, and the\r\nterrible second bloodbath in Sarajevo’s market place, the\r\ncommunity of nations has demonstrated that there is a limit\r\nto the amount of brutality and contempt for international\r\nlaw it will tolerate. And there has to be a limit.\r\nThe resolve of the United Nations and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has paid off — not\r\nonly for the people of Sarajevo, who for three years have\r\nbeen starving and freezing and kept under constant fire, but\r\nalso for the peace process.\r\nYesterday, here in New York, the parties to the\r\nconflict had another meeting with the Contact Group, of\r\nwhich Germany is a member. Another step forward was\r\nachieved on the constitutional issue following the result\r\nachieved in Geneva, and I believe this step to be a decisive\r\none. For the first time since the conflict began there is a\r\nrealistic prospect of a negotiated peace settlement.\r\nBut I should like to warn against being over-\r\neuphoric. A lot has still to be done. We shall have to put\r\none stone on top of another stone in order to finish this\r\nbuilding. This time none of the participants should leave\r\nthe conference table until an agreement has been\r\nreached — a peaceful agreement at the negotiating table,\r\nand not an agreement on the basis of military actions.\r\nAnyone who continues to prefer bloodshed, to prefer\r\nmilitary actions, will be taking a great responsibility upon\r\nhimself.\r\nFrom the beginning, Germany has played an active\r\npart in these efforts. We have never taken sides, nor did\r\nwe ever want to take sides, against one party; rather, we\r\nhave always taken up the cause of the victims, those who\r\nhave been tormented and driven from their homes.\r\nTo date, the German Government’s humanitarian aid\r\nin the region amounts to more than 1 billion Deutsche\r\nmarks. And I should like to stress strongly that we have\r\nno double standards, nor should we have double\r\nstandards. In the short time since August, we have\r\nprovided more than 6 million marks to help Serbian\r\nrefugees from Krajina.\r\nMy country has contributed in various ways to all\r\npeace-keeping operations. By sending medical personnel\r\nto Split and deploying Tornado fighters for the first\r\ntime — fighters which we have made available in\r\nPiacenze, Italy — in a United Nations peace-keeping\r\nmission, we have also shown that we do not merely talk\r\nabout taking on more responsibility, but that we act to do\r\nso.\r\nWe will also meet our responsibility when it comes\r\nto implementing the terms of a peace settlement — and\r\nI hope that this settlement will come soon. The\r\nreconstruction of Bosnia’s economy requires a genuinely\r\ninternational cooperative effort, an effort on the part of\r\nthe international community. The European Union — and\r\nGermany, of course, as a member of the European\r\nUnion — will play its part.\r\nWhat lessons can and must we learn from what has\r\nhappened in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia?\r\nFirst, the United Nations must confine itself to doing\r\nwhat is feasible. Its resources are obviously being strained\r\nbeyond the limit. It cannot take on every responsibility. It\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\ncannot solve all the problems that the world is confronted\r\nwith.\r\nSecondly, the extent and duration of the commitment\r\nof the United Nations must be more precise, the political\r\nand military objectives must be clearly defined, and there\r\nmust be a realistic and, above all, coherent mandate.\r\nThirdly, if the world Organization is going to\r\nintervene, then it must act consistently and resolutely. There\r\nmust be no repetition of what happened in Rwanda or Zepa\r\nor Srebrenica.\r\nFourthly, cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nother organizations such as NATO must from the outset be\r\nplanned in such a way that maximum speed and, above all,\r\nefficiency are assured.\r\nFifthly, we believe that the regional organizations must\r\nplay a larger role than they have done so far. Not every\r\nproblem must go straight to the United Nations. In Europe,\r\nfor instance, and in other places of the world too, the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) could assume much greater responsibility.\r\nHowever, we have to enable it to do so.\r\nStill, let there be no illusions. Peace-keeping is not just\r\na fair-weather exercise. Such missions will always be apt to\r\ncreate problems for the world Organization.\r\nAnd, in view of the hundreds of thousands of lives\r\nthat have been saved in Somalia and Bosnia, who can argue\r\nwith an easy conscience that the United Nations should not\r\nhave intervened? And many of these people have already\r\nbeen forgotten. What is required here is an increased peace-\r\nkeeping capacity — constructive help, not destructive\r\ncriticism.\r\nAnd to those who over and over again have called into\r\nquestion the actions of the United Nations and its peace-\r\nkeeping operations, I would like to address the following\r\nquestion: Is there an alternative? Who could take the place\r\nof the United Nations? Indeed, Europe has not been able to\r\ncope with this tragedy in its own house as well as we all\r\nhoped it would.\r\nBut nor should we forget the European Union’s\r\nachievements in the former Yugoslavia. It paved the way\r\nfor the Contact Group’s ongoing peace efforts.\r\nTo my mind, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia\r\nemphasizes how important and right it was for Western\r\nEurope to embark on a new course after the Second\r\nWorld War, a course that was directed against nationalism\r\nand against the use of force. For four decades, as a result\r\nof the East-West conflict, not all European nations were\r\nable to follow that route of the European Community,\r\ntoday’s European Union.\r\nThe European Union is now striving to correct that\r\nterrible aberration and bridge the gulfs that separate it\r\nfrom Central and Eastern Europe. The goal is one Europe,\r\na Europe in which the old big-Power politics and\r\nhegemonic aspirations can never again take root.\r\nThat Europe must have a legitimate place for Russia,\r\nbut for Ukraine as well. The European house does not\r\nconsist solely of the European Union: it has many rooms.\r\nNeither of these two nations, Russia or Ukraine, should\r\nbe left outside. To our Russian and Ukrainian partners\r\nand friends I say: Europe needs your contribution and it\r\ndoes so also in bringing peace to the former Yugoslavia.\r\nHere their new partnership with the European Union and\r\nNATO must — and, I add, will — prove its value.\r\nMany feared that when the East-West confrontation\r\ndisappeared Europe would focus exclusively on its own\r\naffairs. That has not been the case. The European Union\r\nis intensifying its political, economic and cultural\r\ncooperation with the other regions of the world.\r\nIn Asia, Africa and Latin America it is already a\r\nmodel for peace, prosperity and regional integration. In\r\nthe United Nations the European Union is the principal\r\npartner for dialogue with the developing countries.\r\nThe European Union and Germany have been\r\nparticularly active in promoting peace and economic\r\nrecovery in the Middle East. The recent agreement on the\r\nWest Bank worked out by Yassir Arafat and Shimon\r\nPeres is another important milestone on the road to lasting\r\npeace in that region. I congratulate both sides on their\r\ncourage and on their far-sightedness. The United States is\r\nplaying a major part in this process in this region. We are\r\ngrateful to them for that. Egypt has rendered an important\r\ncontribution as an intermediary.\r\nIncreasing the peace-keeping capacity of the United\r\nNations also involves reforming the Security Council.\r\nThere is now a global consensus, I believe, that this is\r\nnecessary.\r\nThe first steps towards reform have already been\r\ntaken. More changes have been made to the Council’s\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nmethods of work and more transparency achieved in the\r\npast two years than in the whole of the previous four\r\ndecades.\r\nLike many other Member States, Germany considers\r\nthat the Council should have more permanent and non-\r\npermanent members. The nations of Asia, Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica need wider representation and I think we owe it to\r\nthem. They have deserved it. The same applies to several\r\ncountries with an important global role.\r\nGermany, with the support of many Member States,\r\nhas announced its interest in permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. Our willingness to assume greater\r\nresponsibility, also within this framework, is for us the\r\nlogical and consistent extension of our commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations. This commitment is consistent with the\r\nfundamental principle of our foreign policy, which is to\r\ngive priority to multilateral cooperation. We have abided by\r\nthat principle in pursuing European integration, and we\r\nbelieve that that same principle would help us play a useful\r\nrole in the Security Council.\r\nThe world finds itself faced with many new conflicts\r\nand challenges. It is crucial that in dealing with them we\r\nshould focus our efforts more than we have done so far on\r\nconflict prevention. A political solution must remain the\r\nfirst option. That requires wider use of human rights\r\nobservers, improvements in the United Nations early\r\nwarning system, the promotion of democratization and the\r\nobservation of election processes, as successfully done\r\nrecently in Mozambique.\r\nWe have provided a list of experienced intermediaries\r\nfor the tasks of preventive diplomacy. The example of\r\nMacedonia shows what the preventive deployment of\r\nUnited Nations Blue Helmets can achieve. I am very happy\r\nabout the agreement that has been achieved between Greece\r\nand Macedonia on this extremely important issue.\r\nPreventing fire can save countless lives and in any case it\r\nis cheaper than putting fires out. On my recent visit to\r\nRwanda I was deeply shocked, in the truest sense of the\r\nword, by the atrocities that have been perpetrated there by\r\nhuman beings on other human beings. If the United Nations\r\nhad intervened at an early stage and resolutely, many lives\r\ncould have been saved.\r\nGermany has set up a substantial emergency aid\r\nprogramme for Rwanda. We are trying in particular to do\r\nsomething about the awful prison conditions. I myself\r\nvisited prisons, in Kigali for example, and I must tell you\r\nthat I have never seen anything like that in all my life.\r\nUrgent remedies are needed here to ensure that one\r\ninjustice is not followed by another. I travelled to Burundi\r\ntoo, and I returned deeply saddened and concerned. We\r\nmust not make the same mistakes in Burundi.\r\nDisarmament, arms control and confidence-\r\nbuilding — these are some of the main components of\r\nconflict prevention. In recent years we have made the\r\nkind of progress that no one would have believed possible\r\nat the height of the arms race 15 years ago. The task of\r\nbuttressing this breakthrough and building on the\r\nachievements has acquired great political significance.\r\nA few weeks ago we commemorated the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the first atomic bomb explosions over\r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear weapons must never,\r\nnever, be used again. They must be eliminated\r\ncompletely, as required by article VI of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That aim was\r\nreaffirmed by the nuclear Powers at the New York\r\nConference extending the Treaty.\r\nNever has the door to a ban on every kind of\r\nnuclear-test explosion been wider open than today. We\r\nmust now direct all our efforts to the achievement of this\r\ngoal. The Geneva negotiations must produce such a\r\ncomprehensive ban by the autumn of 1996 at the latest.\r\nAnti-personnel mines, too, are “weapons of mass\r\ndestruction”. Day in, day out, they are taking a terrible\r\ntoll on human life, and many of the victims are women\r\nand, above all, innocent children. If any kind of weapon\r\nmust be outlawed, then this one should be.\r\nEliminating this scourge is a task of the highest\r\npriority, particularly in Nicaragua, Angola, Mozambique,\r\nAfghanistan, Georgia and Cambodia. Germany, together\r\nwith its European partners, will continue the initiative in\r\nthis direction during this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAt the First Review Conference of the Convention\r\non certain conventional weapons, which opened in Vienna\r\nthe day before yesterday, tougher export restrictions will\r\nhave to be agreed on and a strict ban imposed on the use\r\nof anti-personnel mines.\r\nI appeal to all Members of the United Nations: In\r\nthe name of humanity, accede to the Convention on\r\ncertain conventional weapons as quickly as possible.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nThere are good reasons why the work of the United\r\nNations began with the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. The United Nations is more than a mere gathering\r\nof sovereign States. It is based on the common belief in the\r\ndignity and worth of every human being, and it is my view\r\nthat this must remain the focal point of all political activity.\r\nUniversal Children’s Day, celebrated a week ago,\r\nreminded us of the awful fate to which these, the weakest\r\nmembers of society, are often exposed. The United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) therefore needs the support of\r\nevery one of us.\r\nThe task of helping those people all over the world\r\nwho have been persecuted and deprived of their rights must\r\nremain at the top of the political agenda. Pressure from the\r\ninternational community, the media, non-governmental\r\norganizations and private citizens must be maintained.\r\nThose who torture people and who treat human rights with\r\ncontempt should not be able to sleep peacefully. To this\r\nend, the High Commissioner’s position will have to be\r\nstrengthened and the Centre for Human Rights better\r\nequipped. People who commit war crimes must know that\r\nthey will be prosecuted under international criminal law.\r\nHence, Germany strongly urges the establishment of a\r\npermanent international court of justice.\r\nBut above all, stronger measures to protect minorities\r\nare called for. “Ethnic cleansing” is no basis for peaceful\r\ncoexistence, either in Europe or anywhere else.\r\nMore than 27 million people are today on the move.\r\nThis is one of the most dramatic events of our time. The\r\ncause is not only hunger and distress, but, in most cases,\r\nunfortunately, ethnic and religious fanaticism. Diversity of\r\nculture and tradition is one of the world’s greatest assets,\r\nand no one should seek to impose a particular model of\r\nsociety on others.\r\nThe fact that there exists a core of human rights which\r\neveryone has to respect is quite a different matter. This was\r\nreaffirmed at the Vienna Conference and should not be\r\nchallenged by anyone.\r\nToday the dialogue of cultures is central to the quest\r\nfor peace. I have invited leading representatives of the\r\nIslamic world to come to Germany in November to\r\nparticipate in such a dialogue. My feeling is that we have\r\nto learn to understand each other better. I have also urged\r\nthat the Bosnia Contact Group closely coordinate its efforts\r\nwith the Islamic Contact Group.\r\nIn Germany, two and a half million Muslims are\r\nliving harmoniously with the local community. In my\r\nview, it is extremely important that we should develop\r\ncooperation and mutual trust at the international level as\r\nwell, and I am speaking as the German Foreign Minister.\r\nIslam cannot be equated with terrorism or\r\nfundamentalism. No new enemy stereotypes must be\r\nallowed to develop. I think that we should be happy that\r\nwe have been able to do away with the old ones.\r\nPeace and development are inseparable. Any reform\r\nof the United Nations worthy of that name should\r\ntherefore encompass economic and social matters as well.\r\nThis fiftieth anniversary is a unique opportunity to create\r\na modern framework for a new development in\r\npartnership. Work on the Agenda for Development must\r\ntherefore be completed as soon as possible.\r\nApart from improving and simplifying the finance\r\nregime for United Nations development activities, the\r\nchief concern is to coordinate and efficiently implement\r\nthe results of the world conferences on the environment,\r\nsocial problems, population growth and women —\r\nespecially the Conference on Women that has just ended\r\nin Beijing.\r\nThese are the main interrelated issues of our time as\r\nwe pursue the goal of peace. The planet Earth must\r\nremain habitable for future generations as well. Progress\r\nis possible only through equal and fair partnership\r\nbetween North and South. Germany will continue to exert\r\nevery effort to this end.\r\nNone of this can be done unless we can come to\r\ngrips with the biggest crisis confronting the United\r\nNations: that of its financial situation. There is no reason\r\nto deny that it has assumed dramatic proportions; one has\r\nto be quite frank about this. This crisis can be overcome\r\nonly if all contributors, and especially the main ones,\r\nmeet their obligations punctually. Germany is the third\r\nlargest contributor to the United Nations, and we pay our\r\nbills. We cannot allow a situation to continue where those\r\nwho pay their contributions on time are also burdened\r\nwith the arrears of wealthier Members. Unless decisive\r\naction is taken very soon, whole areas of activity could\r\ngrind to a halt.\r\nI very much welcome the confirmation by the\r\nAmerican Secretary of State that the United States stands\r\nby the obligations arising from its membership. The\r\nUnited Nations needs an America that fulfils its\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nleadership role, just as the United States needs a world\r\nOrganization capable of, and willing to undertake, reform.\r\nHow can we overcome this financial crisis? First, we\r\nmust restore the balance between the budgets for peace-\r\nkeeping operations and the regular budget of the United\r\nNations. We cannot allow resources for such operations to\r\nbe used up to the point of depletion while at the same time\r\nfunds for urgent programmes of economic or social\r\ndevelopment are either non-existent or have to be cut back.\r\nSecondly, it is time we found a scale of assessments\r\nthat reflects Members’ actual ability to pay. You,\r\nMr. Secretary-General, have made great efforts to\r\nrationalize the Organization’s work, to ensure budgetary\r\ndiscipline and to reduce staff. I appeal to all Member States\r\nto give Under-Secretary-General Paschke the support he\r\nneeds for his difficult job.\r\nThe United Nations is indispensable to the task of\r\nmaintaining global order and as a forum and instrument for\r\ninternational cooperation, today no less than in the era after\r\nthe Second World War. No other organization has the same\r\nability to focus the interests and energies of the world’s\r\nnations, which we believe is necessary.\r\nThe United Nations is not “the others”, but us, the\r\nMembers. And this Organization is only as strong and as\r\nunited as we, its Members, make it.\r\nHence my appeal today to the Assembly: let us stop\r\nour constant vacillation between euphoria and\r\ndisappointment regarding the United Nations. Let us stop\r\napportioning blame, which leads nowhere. Let us rather\r\nmerge vision and pragmatism, solidarity and responsibility\r\nfor our own actions into a rational and realistic international\r\npartnership under the aegis of the United Nations. Let us\r\ngive this world Organization more clout and make it more\r\nefficient and economical. Yes, we will have to slim down\r\nthe United Nations. It has to save money. Let us do these\r\nthings in a constructive spirit, together with, and on behalf\r\nof, the United Nations. Let us give the United Nations what\r\nit needs — including paying our dues.\r\nThat is what the world community expects of us now,\r\nand rightly so. That is the task facing the family of nations\r\non the threshold of the new millennium. If the reforms fail,\r\nthere will be only losers.\r\n“Hope is the pillar of the world”, they say in South\r\nAfrica. Fifty years ago, such a pillar of hope for mankind\r\nwas erected in San Francisco. Let us do everything to\r\nensure that this pillar will continue to support the hopes\r\nof mankind in the next 50 years as well. Germany will\r\ncontinue to play its part.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Qian Qichen.\r\nMr. Qian Qichen (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): Mr. President, please allow me, first of all, to\r\nwarmly congratulate you on your election to the\r\npresidency of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. I am convinced that with your remarkable\r\nability and rich experience, you will admirably fulfil this\r\nmission. I would also like to express my appreciation and\r\nthanks to Mr. Amara Essy for the important contribution\r\nhe has made during his presidency.\r\nI wish to avail myself of this opportunity to extend\r\nmy welcome and congratulations to the Republic of Palau,\r\nwhich was admitted into the United Nations after the last\r\nsession.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the end of\r\nthe Second World War and the founding of the United\r\nNations. Over the past 50 years, the United Nations has\r\nstood the test of the vicissitudes in the international\r\nsituation, grown steadily, scored remarkable achievements\r\nand made major contributions to the peace and prosperity\r\nof mankind. Its membership has increased from 51 at its\r\nfounding to today’s 185. The status and role of the United\r\nNations, the most universal and authoritative\r\nintergovernmental organization of sovereign States today,\r\nis irreplaceable by any other international organization.\r\nThe United Nations has traversed a tortuous and\r\nuneven path over the past fifty years, just like the\r\ndevelopment of anything else. On the occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations,\r\nit is time to review the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, earnestly summarize the positive\r\nand negative experience, and introduce appropriate and\r\nnecessary reforms so as to revitalize the United Nations\r\nand usher it into the new century with a new look to meet\r\nthe challenge of the times. This is the call of all peoples\r\nand a lofty mission of the times.\r\nThe United Nations, which was founded in the\r\ntriumph of the world war against fascism, reflects the\r\nardent desire and determination of the world’s people to\r\navert the scourge of war forever, safeguard world peace\r\nand security, carry out friendly international cooperation\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nand achieve common development. History has repeatedly\r\nproved that adherence to the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter will enable the United Nations to\r\nplay a positive role in safeguarding peace and promoting\r\ndevelopment, while violation of and departure from the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter will impair the\r\ndignity and image of the United Nations and weaken its\r\nrole. Therefore, to continue to uphold and carry forward the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter is an unshirkable\r\nresponsibility of all United Nations Members and a basic\r\nprinciple guiding the reform of the United Nations.\r\nThe core of the United Nations Charter is the principle\r\nof equality between sovereign States and non-interference\r\nin each other’s internal affairs. All sovereign States,\r\nwhether they are big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak,\r\nare equal members of the international community. The\r\ninternal affairs of a country should be managed by its own\r\npeople. Major world affairs should be addressed by\r\ncountries through consultations on the basis of equality and\r\nmutual respect. In international relations, to bully the small,\r\noppress the poor, override the weak, impose one’s own\r\nsocial system, ideology and values on others or interfere in\r\nother countries’ internal affairs all run counter to the spirit\r\nof the United Nations Charter. Some people are publicly\r\nclamouring for “containment” of other countries, which\r\nshows that the cold war mentality still refuses to quit the\r\nstage of history. But it will ultimately be discarded by\r\nhistory. The post-war period of half a century proves that\r\nin handling State-to-State relations, “hot war”, “cold war”\r\nor “bloc politics” do not work. Strict observance of the\r\nprinciples of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each\r\nother’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and\r\npeaceful coexistence are the only way for States to live in\r\namity with each other and achieve common development.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, thanks\r\nto the joint efforts of various quarters, the tendency towards\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through negotiations has\r\ngrown and international economic cooperation has gained\r\nmomentum. However, there still remain many destabilizing\r\nand uncertain factors in the international situation.\r\nHegemonism and power politics continue to hold out. Peace\r\nand development, the two major tasks of the world today,\r\nstill face grave challenges.\r\nArmed conflicts and catastrophic wars in some parts\r\nof the world remain unabated, which has not only inflicted\r\nheavy losses of life and property on the countries and\r\npeoples concerned, but also casts a shadow over regional\r\npeace and stability and that of the whole world. All this\r\ncannot but cause concern and distress among the world’s\r\npeople. As the background and causes behind these\r\nconflicts are complicated, to seek a just, fair and\r\nappropriate solution to them would call for tremendous\r\nand concerted efforts by all the parties concerned, the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community as a\r\nwhole. We maintain that the parties concerned should, in\r\nthe fundamental and long-term interests of the people,\r\nseek just and fair solutions through negotiations, taking\r\ninto full account both history and reality as well as the\r\nreasonable interests and positions of all sides. Where\r\nconsensus cannot be reached immediately, the parties\r\nconcerned should exercise restraint and patience so as to\r\nprevent contradictions from intensifying and at the same\r\ntime try to create conditions and an atmosphere for an\r\neventual peaceful settlement.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in recent\r\nyears have played a useful role in settling international\r\ndisputes peacefully. They have both accumulated\r\nsuccessful experience and learned lessons from setbacks.\r\nWe believe that, to ensure a healthy development of\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations and activities in\r\nother related fields such as preventive diplomacy, the\r\nfollowing guidelines should be established and followed:\r\nObservation of the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, in particular the principle of\r\nrespect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of other countries;\r\nSettlement of disputes through peaceful means such\r\nas good offices, mediation and negotiations instead of\r\nresort to frequent mandatory actions. Even humanitarian\r\noperations should not resort to military means;\r\nOpposition to double standards and the imposition of\r\nthe policies and views of one or a few countries on the\r\nSecurity Council. Some countries should not be allowed\r\nto carry out military intervention in the name of the\r\nUnited Nations;\r\nFor peace-keeping operations, adherence to the\r\nprinciples that have proved effective, such as obtaining\r\nprior consent from the parties concerned, observing strict\r\nneutrality and the non-use of force except for self-\r\ndefence;\r\nAdoption of a realistic approach and confining the\r\noperation within one’s capability. Peace-keeping\r\noperations should be launched only when conditions are\r\nripe and should refrain, in whatever circumstances, from\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nbecoming a party to a conflict in deviation from the\r\nfundamental orientation of such operations.\r\nIt has been demonstrated time and again that United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations, if divorced from these\r\nguidelines, would, contrary to our wishes, fail to achieve\r\ntheir desired objectives and might even go astray.\r\nLast May, the Review and Extension Conference of\r\nthe States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) adopted the decision to renew the\r\nNPT indefinitely. This serves the interests of all signatories,\r\nhelps to strengthen the international non-proliferation\r\nregime and is conducive to the maintenance of world peace\r\nand security. China believes that nuclear non-proliferation\r\nis only an interim step towards the ultimate goal of the\r\ncomplete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear\r\nweapons. The indefinite extension of the NPT must not be\r\nconstrued as an indefinite license for the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to perpetuate their prerogatives.\r\nOne year ago, also from this rostrum, on behalf of the\r\nChinese Government I called for the conclusion of a\r\nconvention on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons\r\nand put forward a series of complete and interrelated\r\nproposals on nuclear disarmament. We are pleased to note\r\nthat the negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty\r\nhave produced some gratifying progress. China supports the\r\nconclusion of such a treaty no later than 1996 and will\r\ncontinue to work with other countries to this end. Once the\r\ntreaty enters into force, China will stop its nuclear testing.\r\nChina’s possession of a limited nuclear capability is\r\nentirely for self-defence and for deterring the nuclear threat\r\nagainst it. The Chinese Government has from the very\r\nbeginning unilaterally undertaken not to be the first to use\r\nnuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances\r\nand not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States. China’s nuclear weapons\r\ntherefore do not constitute a threat to any country. We\r\nstrongly urge other nuclear-weapon States to respond\r\npositively to China’s initiative by immediately starting\r\nnegotiations aimed at concluding a treaty on mutual non-\r\nfirst-use of nuclear weapons and an agreement on the non-\r\nuse or non-threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States and nuclear-free zones.\r\nIt has become a trend in today’s world that when\r\ncountries formulate their domestic and foreign policies they\r\naccord top priority to the economy and pay close attention\r\nto national economic development. The worldwide tendency\r\ntowards economic integration, regionalization and the\r\nformation of economic groupings has accelerated, and\r\ncompetition among States in the economic, trade,\r\nscientific and technological fields has further intensified.\r\nUnder such circumstances, the developing countries are\r\nfaced with a formidable challenge as they strive for\r\neconomic growth and higher living standards for their\r\npeople.\r\nFurthermore, over 1 billion people on this planet\r\nremain in abject poverty; this constitutes one of the world\r\ncommunity’s most acute problems. Given much-needed\r\nsupport to the developing countries as they reactivate their\r\neconomies and creating a favourable external environment\r\nfor them are not only important conditions for the shared\r\neconomic growth and common prosperity of all countries,\r\nbut also a crucial guarantee for lasting peace and stability\r\nthroughout the world. Given the present situation, the\r\nUnited Nations should ask itself to pay at least as much\r\nattention to development as to peace, effectively perform\r\nits duties under the Charter and play a more dynamic role\r\nin galvanizing economic growth and development in the\r\ndeveloping countries. The reform of the United Nations\r\nmust result in the strengthening, not the weakening, of its\r\nrole in the area of development.\r\nTrue, fairly rapid economic growth in the developing\r\ncountries must depend primarily on their own efforts.\r\nHowever, it is also important for the international\r\ncommunity, and the developed countries in particular, to\r\ntake practical and effective measures to open markets,\r\nprovide development funds, transfer technology, increase\r\ndevelopment aid and reduce the debt burden in favour of\r\nthe developing countries. International economic\r\ncooperation should be guided by the principle of mutual\r\nopening-up, equality and mutual benefit. Such practices as\r\nimplementing protectionist policies of one form or another\r\nand attaching political strings to economic assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries are obviously misguided.\r\nProfound changes have taken place in China amid\r\nthe surging tide of change and development across the\r\nworld. The 17 years that have elapsed since the beginning\r\nof reform and opening-up in China have been\r\nunprecedented in terms of the economic growth rate and\r\nthe improvement of the people’s living standards. At\r\npresent, China enjoys political stability, economic\r\nprosperity, ethnic harmony and vigorous advances in\r\ndemocracy, legality and community undertakings. China’s\r\nexchanges and cooperation with the rest of the world have\r\nreached a level unprecedented in both scope and depth.\r\nAlthough there may still be many difficulties and\r\nchallenges along the road ahead, we are confident that,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nthrough several generations of hard work, our people will\r\nlift China out of economic and cultural backwardness and\r\nturn it into a highly prosperous and democratic modern\r\ncountry.\r\nThe Chinese people are peace-loving people. China’s\r\nhistory for over a century following the Opium War was\r\none of tears, blood and humiliation in which the Chinese\r\nnation was subjected to repeated aggression, suppression\r\nand plunder at the hands of the big Powers. Do unto others\r\nas you would have others do unto you. The Chinese people\r\ntreasure their hard-won independence and freedom and will\r\nnever commit aggression or intervene against others. China\r\nis opposed to hegemonism and power politics of any kind\r\nand will never seek hegemony for itself. With a population\r\nof 1.2 billion, China will remain a low-income developing\r\ncountry for a very long time and the steady improvement of\r\nour people’s living standards will remain our objective,\r\ntowards the attainment of which no effort will be spared.\r\nEven when China grows stronger, it will continue firmly to\r\npursue its independent foreign policy of peace and will live\r\nin amity with other nations. A stable and prosperous China\r\nis a positive factor for peace and development in Asia and\r\nthe world at large. This is a conclusion that people of\r\nvision around the world have come to share.\r\nThe Chinese people have waged heroic and unyielding\r\nstruggles to resist external aggression and oppression and to\r\ndefend the sovereignty, independence and unity of the\r\ncountry. There is but one China in the world. The\r\nGovernment of the People’s Republic of China is the sole\r\nlegal Government of China. It is the sole representative of\r\nChina at the United Nations, and Taiwan is an inalienable\r\npart of China. The peaceful reunification of the two sides\r\nof the Taiwan Straits represents the unshakable will and\r\ndetermination of the entire Chinese people, including our\r\ncompatriots in Taiwan. Proceeding from this reality, the\r\nChinese Government has put forward the correct proposal\r\non peaceful reunification within the framework of the\r\nconcept of “one country, two systems” and a series of\r\nrealistic and practicable policies and measures. The past\r\nfew years have seen a steady expansion and deepening of\r\nexchanges and contacts between the two sides in various\r\nfields. Any attempt to obstruct peaceful reunification and to\r\nsplit Taiwan from China is doomed to failure. Should\r\nanyone try to do so, he would be lifting a stone only to\r\ndrop it on his own toes.\r\nHistory moves on. Mankind is progressing. In four\r\nyears we will usher in a new millennium. The future is full\r\nof promise. Let us join hands and make concerted efforts to\r\nbring about a better world in which there are peace and\r\ncooperation, justice and equality, mutual respect and\r\ncommon development, a world of universal prosperity and\r\ncontinuous progress.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of France, His Excellency Mr. Hervé de\r\nCharette.\r\nMr. de Charette (France) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Mr. President, I should like to say first how\r\npleased France is to see you personally presiding over the\r\nwork of the General Assembly. Beyond your personal\r\nmerits, which I acknowledge with pleasure, your election\r\nunderscores the important contribution to the activities of\r\nthe Organization of Portugal, a member of the European\r\nUnion with which France feels particularly close.\r\nThe United Nations is 50 years old. As the Heads of\r\nState and Government of the European Union solemnly\r\nemphasized in Cannes last June, the collective work since\r\nthe Second World War has been considerable. The\r\nEuropean Council on that occasion paid tribute to the\r\nmajor contribution of the United Nations to this collective\r\nwork and gave some examples: decolonization, the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\ndisarmament, development, humanitarian aid and, of\r\ncourse, the protection of human rights.\r\nBut the successes of the Organization do not belong\r\nsolely to history. This year has shown the vitality of the\r\nUnited Nations. In Copenhagen, the social dimension of\r\ndevelopment, the struggle against exclusion and for\r\nproductive employment, which are both major challenges\r\nfor all our societies, are now within the domain of our\r\nOrganization. In Beijing, the principle of strict equality\r\nbetween men and women and the right of women to\r\ndecide freely about their lives in all matters have finally\r\nbeen endorsed once and for all as universal values. In\r\nNew York, the United Nations has begun preparatory\r\nwork towards the establishment of a world criminal court.\r\nThis project signals decisive progress for international\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIn Vienna, at this very moment, a conference on the\r\nscourge of inhumane weapons is being held. France is\r\nworking in particular to eradicate the scourge of the\r\nspread of anti-personnel mines. In 1993, it decided upon\r\na unilateral moratorium on the export of these mines.\r\nNow the time has come to go one step farther.\r\nAccordingly, I wish to confirm that France has decided to\r\nadopt a unilateral moratorium on the production of all\r\ncategories of anti-personnel mines. It is therefore\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nimposing upon itself a ban on the manufacture of such\r\nweapons. France also pledges from this point on to destroy\r\ngradually its stock of anti-personnel mines. I call on all\r\nMember States to join with us and do the same thing.\r\nThis year has also been marked by the success of the\r\nNew York Review and Extension Conference of the States\r\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons. This success was a major step towards\r\ndisarmament. France proposes that this coming year should\r\nbe a time for further progress in this domain: disarmament\r\nshould be our common goal and it should encompass all\r\naspects of disarmament. France calls upon the States that\r\nhave not yet adhered to this Treaty to do so without further\r\ndelay. The struggle against the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons must be universal. I suggest that all the States\r\nwhich have already signed this Treaty multiply concerted\r\nefforts to persuade the States which have not yet signed to\r\njoin them.\r\nIn addition, it is important to follow through on the\r\nnew objectives decided by the review Conference of the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty in May. Among these, the most\r\nimportant is the conclusion, no later than 1996, of the\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty now being negotiated\r\nin Geneva. The President of the French Republic,\r\nMr. Jacques Chirac, most solemnly reaffirmed on 13 June\r\n1995 France’s determination to achieve this goal and to\r\nensure that the ban is total. France is pleased that other\r\nnuclear Powers have in turn made the same commitment.\r\nIt calls on all nuclear Powers to ensure, together with all\r\nthe Member States of the Organization, that this pledge is\r\nduly confirmed in the text of the future treaty and that the\r\nnegotiation of the treaty is completed before the autumn of\r\n1996.\r\nI take this opportunity to recall the reasons that led\r\nFrance to complete the programme of nuclear tests that was\r\ntemporarily suspended in 1992. The final series of tests\r\nnow under way has no other purpose than to enable us to\r\nsign the treaty banning nuclear tests definitively. There\r\nwere some who imagined and others who wished to make\r\nbelieve that we might reconsider such a decision. This will\r\nnot happen. Once again I repeat, this is a final test series,\r\nlimited to what is strictly necessary and held under\r\nconditions that have been proved to be harmless. It will\r\nenable us to adhere as early as possible to the future treaty\r\nbanning tests definitively.\r\nThe disarmament effort must of course be directed\r\ntowards reducing existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\r\nSubstantial progress has been achieved over the past few\r\nyears with the destruction of a significant number of\r\nwarheads by the two main Powers. I would recall that\r\nFrance for its part, although it has never contributed to\r\nnuclear overarmament, reduced the nuclear warheads it\r\nhad deployed by 15 per cent between 1991 and 1995.\r\nDisarmament, however, does not apply solely to\r\nnuclear weapons. With regard to chemical weapons, I call\r\nupon all the Member States to ratify, or for those which\r\nhave not yet done so to adhere to, the 1992 Convention\r\nbanning chemical weapons. I regret that France is the\r\nonly permanent member of the Security Council that has\r\nratified this Convention. I hope that the other permanent\r\nmembers will do so in the coming months.\r\nWe must continue the effort to reduce conventional\r\nforces in Europe. France took its full part in the\r\nagreement on conventional force reductions in Europe. It\r\nproposes that the conference which will be held in May\r\n1996 to examine the implementation of this agreement\r\nshould focus on compliance by all States with a treaty\r\nthat is the keystone of security in Europe. This conference\r\nshould also be the occasion for further progress.\r\nThere remains the highly sensitive issue of the\r\nConvention banning biological weapons. A serious\r\nverification system has to be set up. I hope that the\r\nworking group responsible for this matter in Geneva\r\nquickly establishes such a system.\r\nMy country cannot accept the argument put forward\r\nby some that the Organization has failed in its task. We\r\nreject the accusations of passivity and helplessness that\r\nare sometimes made against it. Nevertheless, we cannot\r\nhide the fact that the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nwill not be as joyful and as optimistic as we would have\r\nliked. The image of the Organization in public opinion is\r\nconfused, even negative at times. We should try together\r\nand with a clear head to identify the reasons for such a\r\nsituation. I am convinced they have nothing to do with\r\nany disaffection with the Organization. Never have the\r\naspirations of our peoples, especially the youth of the\r\nworld, so matched the objectives of the Charter: peace\r\nand disarmament, environmental protection, solidarity\r\nwith the very poor, aid to those who suffer, the promotion\r\nof democracy, of liberty and basic human rights, and the\r\ncollective struggle against the major scourges of the end\r\nof the century, namely drugs, terrorism and AIDS. In the\r\nlast few years, we have witnessed the emergence of a\r\nbody of common values on a world scale. These are the\r\nvalues which the United Nations, like France, upholds;\r\nthey are the values of peace.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nIn Europe we built with our neighbours a Community\r\nand then a European Union, and in doing so we turned a\r\npage of a history that had so often led us to confrontation\r\nwith each other. Since 1945 Europe has known a period of\r\nunparalleled peace. The European Union is on the verge of\r\nbeing enlarged again. France warmly welcomes the\r\nforthcoming membership of its neighbours in Central,\r\nEastern and Mediterranean Europe, and will do everything\r\nto make it a great success. In this way, the unity of our\r\ncontinent is gradually being organized.\r\nThe extension of the boundaries of the European\r\nUnion does not lead it to close in on itself. Quite the\r\ncontrary, Europe is opening up to nearby neighbours from\r\nthe South, as the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in\r\nBarcelona will demonstrate. I should like to emphasize the\r\nfundamental importance of that Conference. Europe also\r\nwants to develop its relations with Asia; in this regard, the\r\nfirst Europe-Asia Summit, scheduled for March 1996, will\r\nbe a clear illustration. Lastly, Europe is deepening its\r\npartnership with Russia as well as enhancing its close ties\r\nwith the United States and other partners.\r\nI would like to insist on the fact that the European\r\nUnion, under the impetus of the French presidency, has\r\nconfirmed its privileged relationship with the African,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific countries in the context of the Lomé\r\nConvention and its special place in North-South relations as\r\nthe leading donor of development assistance.\r\nIn all those areas, Europe has set the example.\r\nThese values of peace are also at work in the Middle\r\nEast. France welcomes the important results that have\r\nalready been achieved under the peace process. I am\r\nthinking of the Declaration of Principles of 13 September\r\n1993 and the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 26 October\r\n1994. But, above all, I am pleased to see that the principles\r\nagreed upon in Oslo have at last borne fruit with the long-\r\nawaited initialling of the interim agreement this Sunday.\r\nWith this, a major turning-point, manifested by the\r\ndeclaration of principles, has been given concrete form. The\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace process is now irreversible. I also\r\nhope that the talks between Israel and Syria will soon\r\nresume and that negotiations will start between Israel and\r\nLebanon so that a just and lasting peace, in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\r\n425 (1978), be guaranteed throughout the region.\r\nAs the French President, Mr. Jacques Chirac, stated at\r\nthe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary at Geneva, the\r\nworld needs the United Nations. And it knows it, as proved\r\nby the increasing number of tasks Member States have\r\nentrusted to the Organization.\r\nTherefore, today’s doubts have another origin. I see\r\ntwo major causes. First, the United Nations is not shown\r\nsufficient respect, probably because of a lack of political\r\nwill and resources. Secondly, the Organization has yet to\r\ndemonstrate its ability to reform itself.\r\nLet me speak of respect first. One will never be able\r\nlay sufficient stress on the devastating effect of the sight\r\nof the Blue Berets of the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) held hostage last spring, in chains and\r\nhumiliated in their dignity as men and soldiers. In\r\nSomalia, in Rwanda prior to Operation Turquoise, in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia since the outbreak of the conflict, the\r\nsoldiers of peace had already found themselves in\r\nsituations that the United Nations accepted but that no\r\nMember State would ever have tolerated. It is not\r\nsurprising that the image of the Organization has thereby\r\nsuffered.\r\nI want to make myself clear. It is not a matter of\r\nquestioning the enormous work that has been\r\naccomplished by the United Nations peace-keeping forces\r\nsince the end of the cold war: Namibia, Cambodia,\r\nMozambique, El Salvador and Haiti owe to those forces\r\nprogress that would have been impossible without the\r\nUnited Nations. In Somalia, the United Nations saved\r\nthousands of lives. Its intervention in the countries of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia made it possible to prevent the war\r\nfrom spreading to Macedonia, to contain and dampen the\r\nconflict within central Bosnia and Croatia, and, above all,\r\nto ensure the survival of the populations in certain safe\r\nareas, in Sarajevo in particular, for three years. However,\r\nwe have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable\r\nsuffering, to shameful operations of so-called “ethnic\r\ncleansing” and to crimes against humanity, which the\r\ninternational community was unable to prevent and before\r\nwhich it remained passive.\r\nThese tragic events have shown the dangers of\r\nmixing humanitarian and military missions and the risks\r\nincurred when the mission conferred by the United\r\nNations is lacking in clarity. The Organization needs to\r\nmake itself respected when it intervenes in a conflict. Last\r\nspring, France proposed to its partners that the time to\r\nreact had come at last. It suggested a change in attitude\r\nand policy, with the formation of a powerfully armed\r\nRapid Reaction Force. We have since begun, in liaison\r\nwith the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\r\ndecisive action to lift the siege of Sarajevo. This has\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nenabled the United Nations to recover the respect of all\r\nparties.\r\nThis strengthening of the United Nations capacities for\r\naction has no other objective than to place force at the\r\nservice of law. Only a political solution can truly settle the\r\nconflicts brought about by the dissolution of the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nThat is why France, together with its partners in the\r\nEuropean Union and within the Contact Group, has taken\r\na clear position in favour of a settlement based on two\r\nmain principles, namely, respect for international law and\r\nthe support of the settlement by all the populations\r\nconcerned.\r\nRespect for international law entails a rejection of any\r\nsolution which, imposed by force, would mean breaking\r\nwith the founding principles of our Organization. Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina is a recognized State and a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. Its territorial integrity and sovereignty must\r\nbe preserved. There is nothing to discuss or negotiate on\r\nthose two matters.\r\nThose who have chosen to break the law and who\r\nhave committed the crimes of which we are all aware will\r\nbe held responsible individually. The International Criminal\r\nTribunal, whose creation was proposed by France in 1992,\r\nmust fully exert its jurisdiction.\r\nIt is also important that all the citizens of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina should be able to assert their specific character\r\nthrough representative entities. Let each entity have direct\r\nmanagement of its own affairs and even be able to maintain\r\nspecial relations with States whose populations share the\r\nsame affinities. All this is legitimate so long as the\r\nmanagement of common interests and the exercise of the\r\nfunctions of sovereignty are not brought into question.\r\nThe agreement on the principles of a settlement\r\nproposed to the protagonists in this conflict by the Contact\r\nGroup at Geneva on 8 September of this year and accepted\r\nby their representatives, meets these two criteria. This is\r\nwhy France has welcomed it, approves it and will support\r\nit. The agreement and subsequent actions represent an\r\nencouraging step, but they are only a first step. The extent\r\nof what remains to be done to end the tragedy of Bosnia\r\nclearly shows the major role that the United Nations will\r\nhave to take. In that mission, it can rely on France’s\r\nunwavering support. It must also rely on the support of the\r\ninternational community. Peace will be the work of all.\r\nThe decline in the respect shown the Organization is\r\nevident in another domain that also affects its survival,\r\nnamely, its financing. It is not normal for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the world’s largest Organization, faced with\r\nthe threat of imminent bankruptcy, to have fewer avenues\r\nof recourse in dealing with his debtors than the smallest\r\nof our businesses. It is not acceptable for Member\r\nStates — and I am not thinking here only of those that\r\nare experiencing real economic difficulties — to show\r\nsuch scant respect for the Organization by ignoring the\r\nlegal obligations they have freely accepted.\r\nFrance would like to see the United Nations stronger\r\nand more respected. For this to occur, however, it is also\r\nessential that the Organization be reformed and adapted.\r\nThe Secretary-General has spared no effort to open\r\nthe way to reform. Under his aegis, significant progress\r\nhas been made in the management of the Organization.\r\nAll the debates in these past few years were undertaken\r\nat his initiative and have been based on his proposals in\r\nthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.\r\nFrance is awaiting with the greatest interest the Agenda\r\nfor Democracy, which will complete this triptych in a\r\nfield in which the United Nations is called on to take the\r\nleading role. The Organization has need, more than ever,\r\nof its Secretary-General in order to adapt to the demands\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nHowever, it also requires the political will of its\r\nMember States, and this is not sufficiently in evidence. At\r\nthe opening of this fiftieth session, my wish is a simple\r\none. Let us concentrate on the projects that have already\r\nbeen begun so that they can be completed soon, within\r\nthe coming year. France will contribute to this, and I\r\nshould like in this respect to submit a few proposals.\r\nOne of our main objectives will be to reach an\r\nagreement on enlarging the Security Council. Enlargement\r\nwill be successful only if the Council continues in a\r\nlasting way to be representative of the community of\r\nnations through a reasonable increase in the number of its\r\nmembers.\r\nI should like to reaffirm this today: the Security\r\nCouncil will have to welcome Germany and Japan as\r\npermanent members, as well as some major States of the\r\ndeveloping world. It would also be desirable, naturally,\r\nfor the Council simultaneously to be opened to some new\r\nnon-permanent members.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nThe negotiation on the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil now can and should be concluded quickly. Let us\r\nwait no longer. It is equally imperative for the discussion\r\non United Nations financing to produce results in the next\r\nfew months.\r\nBut we must be honest with ourselves. This\r\nnegotiation depends in part on the response to the United\r\nStates’ request for a reduction in its assessed contribution\r\nto the budget for peace-keeping operations. I shall not try\r\nto disguise France’s genuine doubts as to the legitimacy of\r\nthis request.\r\nNone the less, for the higher interests of the\r\nOrganization, my country is ready to examine this question\r\nwithout any a priori conclusions. It does, however, set\r\ncertain imperative conditions. The first condition is that any\r\nnew scale must respect fully the real capacity of Member\r\nStates to pay. On this point I should like once again to pay\r\ntribute to your country, Mr. President. Portugal decided this\r\nyear, of its own accord, to increase its contribution to the\r\nbudget for peace-keeping operations. The second condition\r\nis that the agreement must make it possible for the\r\nOrganization to start off again on sound bases. All existing\r\narrears will therefore have to be paid up. The third\r\ncondition is that automatic sanctions should be applied to\r\nthose who do not pay appropriately in order to prevent a\r\nrecurrence of the current crisis.\r\nThis is the modest price of enabling the United\r\nNations to devote itself less nervously to its two principal\r\nmissions: peace-keeping and development.\r\nPeace-keeping is the domain of the Security Council,\r\nthe only body empowered to decide on the use of force and\r\nto determine the principles and mandate of operations\r\ncarried out in the interest of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe have to learn the lessons of the experiences of\r\nrecent years. Aside from traditional peace-keeping, the\r\nUnited Nations may find itself obliged, in accordance with\r\nthe mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council, to\r\nresort to force, within the limitations of its means, in order\r\nto preserve whatever can be preserved. United Nations\r\nmilitary action is often the sole recourse available to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is therefore essential to increase the efficiency of the\r\nUnited Nations in the service of peace. Among the most\r\npressing matters, I wish to underline the need to set up\r\ncapacities for rapid intervention, in the framework of the\r\nvital process begun two years ago concerning stand-by\r\nforces. I wish also to mention the need to improve the\r\ncommand of operations and the interest in a still greater\r\nuse of preventive diplomacy.\r\nI would like to say a few words about a situation\r\nthat is of grave concern to France and that calls\r\nspecifically for urgent action in preventive diplomacy on\r\na large scale. I am referring to the situation in the Great\r\nLakes region of Africa.\r\nSince the assassination of Burundi’s President,\r\nMr. Ndadaye, and the unprecedented tragedy that struck\r\nRwanda, this entire region has been deeply destabilized.\r\nMore than 2 million Rwandans and Burundis are living\r\noutside their country in terrible conditions, with the\r\ndifficulties that all this entails for the host countries. The\r\nabsence of lasting political solutions, the climate of\r\ninsecurity and fear that is kept alive by all the extremists,\r\nthe suspicion reigning on all sides, the risk of new\r\ntragedies — all this compels us to address together and in\r\ndepth the fundamental problems in this area, taking into\r\naccount their extreme complexity and the trauma caused\r\nby the genocide that has plunged Rwanda into mourning.\r\nFrance remains convinced that only a comprehensive\r\nregional approach that is political in character will make\r\nit possible to do this. The principle of a conference on\r\npeace, stability and security in the Great Lakes region is\r\nnow accepted, and we welcome the recent appointment of\r\na Special Representative by the Secretary-General. But\r\ntime is of the essence.\r\nThis conference must be carefully prepared, with the\r\nactive participation of the States most directly involved\r\nand interested in its success, and it must lead to the\r\nestablishment of a stability pact for the African Great\r\nLakes region. There are three elements that I believe to\r\nbe essential in this respect: first, the adoption of\r\nprinciples for the return of the refugees and for national\r\nreconciliation, along with a commitment by States not to\r\ntolerate any activity hostile to their neighbours on their\r\nterritory; secondly, the conclusion of bilateral or\r\nmultilateral agreements among the States concerned to\r\nenshrine these principles and commitments and to give\r\nthem substance; and, finally, the organization of a follow-\r\nup mechanism under the aegis of the Security Council.\r\nFrance holds the conviction that development\r\nassistance is the second, or perhaps the first, raison d’être\r\nof the United Nations. Here, too, the balance sheet invites\r\nreflection. How can we not have questions about the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nfeebleness of results, the persistence of extreme poverty, or\r\nat times even famine, these crises that erase all prospects of\r\ndevelopment and bring indescribable suffering to\r\npopulations? How can we not have questions about the\r\nreduced contributions of the world’s richest countries?\r\nThese failures have gone onto the record. Now we\r\nmust act, reform and take the best advantage of the\r\nexperience we have acquired. The institutions of the United\r\nNations and their network of representatives in the field are\r\nstrong points. The development agencies have to refocus\r\ntheir activity specifically on their objectives. They have to\r\nset real priorities aimed at addressing real needs — in other\r\nwords, first and foremost the needs of the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nBut it would be shocking if, as I sometimes predict\r\nwill happen, reform were boosted for the sole purpose of\r\nreducing still further the contribution of the richest States\r\nin the struggle against human poverty.\r\nFrance, together with its partners in the European\r\nUnion, hopes to bring about, through An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment a mobilization for development on new\r\nfoundations. The situation is too disturbing to set the\r\ninterests of the States of the North and South in opposition\r\nto each other. We are all bound by a higher duty: the global\r\nstruggle against poverty.\r\nIf, before this session comes to a close, we are able to\r\nenlarge the Security Council, to place United Nations\r\nfinancing on solid bases, to give the Organization the\r\nmeans to intervene rapidly and effectively to maintain peace\r\nand, finally, to modernize the modalities and institutions for\r\ndevelopment assistance, we will truly have celebrated the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, above and\r\nbeyond all the speech-making, in a fitting manner: by our\r\nactions.\r\nAllow me finally to mention a project that is\r\nparticularly dear to me: to re-establish, on the occasion of\r\nthis anniversary, the universality of our Organization, which\r\nis reflected in the diversity of cultures and languages\r\nmanifested here.\r\nLinguistic pluralism is essential. It reflects the right of\r\neach Member State to understand the others, but also its\r\nduty to make itself understood. A draft resolution on this\r\nsubject will be submitted to the Assembly; it will deal with\r\nthe use of languages in the Assembly’s deliberations and in\r\nthe Secretariat, and I hope it will enshrine the need to retain\r\nsufficient resources to ensure the provisions of translation\r\nand interpretation services. I am convinced that we will\r\nreach a consensus in this regard.\r\nOur Organization has deliberately taken its actions\r\nfor the long term. Recent events may obscure\r\nachievements that are nevertheless solid, the results of\r\ncollective, patient, courageous work. But the gains are\r\nthere. It is up to each of us to make them known and\r\nconsolidate them so that the United Nations may continue\r\nto fulfil the indispensable role entrusted to it 50 years\r\nago.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Pakistan, His Excellency Mr. Sardar\r\nAseff Ahmad Ali.\r\nMr. Ali (Pakistan): I extend to you, Sir, my\r\ndelegation’s felicitations on your well-deserved election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fiftieth\r\nsession. We have no doubt that with your experience and\r\nwisdom, you will add much to this historic session. We\r\nalso pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy, who presided over the Assembly at its\r\nforty-ninth session with great distinction and wisdom.\r\nTo His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our\r\nSecretary-General, I would like to pay a special tribute\r\nfor all he has done for peace and the promotion of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nTo the Republic of Palau, a new Member of our\r\nOrganization, I would like to say, “Welcome”. We look\r\nforward to working closely with that country.\r\nWe are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of our Organization. On this momentous\r\noccasion, as the Secretary-General aptly observed in his\r\nreport (A/49/1), we must resolve to\r\n“appreciate and strengthen the accomplishments of\r\nthe past, to recognize and meet the challenges of the\r\npresent, and to design and implement a plan for the\r\nUnited Nations of the future.” (A/49/1, para. 12)\r\nWe must seize this historic opportunity to forge a global\r\nconsensus behind development, in all its dimensions, as\r\nthe lasting foundation for international peace and security\r\nand as the greatest hope of humanity.\r\nPakistan has been strongly committed to the noble\r\nvision of the United Nations Charter ever since its\r\nindependence. We have continuously abided by its\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nprinciples. We reaffirm our faith in their timeless validity.\r\nPakistan will continue to extend its support and cooperation\r\nto the collective efforts of the world for peace.\r\nAfter exactly 50 years, retrospection evokes mixed\r\nfeelings. Yet members of our Organization have much to\r\ncelebrate. The decolonization process, the elimination of\r\napartheid, humanitarian assistance and handling of refugee\r\nsituations are some of the areas where the United Nations\r\ncan be proud of its achievements. But much remains to be\r\ndone.\r\nThe end of the cold war provided a historic\r\nopportunity to build a new edifice of peace and prosperity:\r\na system in which international relations would be\r\nconducted in a spirit of justice, equality and democracy;\r\nwhere poverty would cease to exist, through international\r\ncooperation for development; where human rights,\r\nespecially the right to self-determination, would be\r\npromoted and protected; and where aggression would be\r\neffectively and collectively challenged wherever and\r\nwhenever it occurred.\r\nRegrettably, this has not happened. Now, more than\r\never, it seems that the powerful countries are imposing their\r\nwill on the United Nations. The decisions and the\r\nresolutions adopted by it reflect the interests of a few rather\r\nthan the good of all. The provisions of collective security\r\nare being invoked selectively. Human rights standards are\r\nbeing defended more vociferously in some situations than\r\nin others. While in some cases aggression has been\r\nforcefully and decisively resisted, in others it has remained\r\nunchecked and even rewarded.\r\nJammu and Kashmir is a case in question, where the\r\nMuslim majority continue to be denied their right to self-\r\ndetermination promised to them by Security Council\r\nresolutions. These resolutions remain unimplemented. The\r\ndenial of the right to self-determination led to a massive\r\nuprising in the Indian-occupied Kashmir in 1989. Demand\r\nfor the exercise of this fundamental right was met with a\r\nbrutal reign of terror unleashed by the Indian occupation\r\nforces. It continues unabated and is being pursued with\r\nmalicious intensity, with devastating consequences for the\r\ncivilian population of this internationally recognized\r\ndisputed territory. In Kashmir the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, international law and international morality\r\nhave been violated with impunity. The massive and\r\nwidespread human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir\r\nhave been graphically documented by a large number of\r\ninternational human rights organizations.\r\nSince I stood at this rostrum a year ago, tensions\r\nhave further escalated in South Asia. One billion people\r\nof South Asia are holding their breath as threats of war\r\nkeep emanating from the leaders in New Delhi.\r\nJammu and Kashmir continues to burn. The sons and\r\ndaughters of Kashmir continue to be killed, maimed,\r\nexecuted, tortured and dishonoured. Will the new year of\r\nthe United Nations bring an end to the rape of Kashmir?\r\nWill the beginning of the next half century of the United\r\nNations see the implementation of its resolutions on\r\nKashmir?\r\nThe Jammu and Kashmir dispute was not brought to\r\nthe Security Council by Pakistan. It was India which\r\nmoved this dispute before the United Nations. The people\r\nof Kashmir are looking to this body to deliver them their\r\nright to self-determination, as promised to them by this\r\nbody, by the international community and by India and\r\nPakistan.\r\nSince I stood before the Assembly a year ago,\r\nhundreds of Kashmiris have been killed by the Indian\r\nforces. Holy places of the Muslims have been razed to the\r\nground by the Indian occupation forces. The holiest of the\r\nholy shrines, Charar-e-Sharif, was burned to ashes. The\r\ncity of Charar-e-Sharif was torched. Is it not ironical that\r\nthe great Sufi saint, Noor-ud-Din Wali, buried in the\r\nshrine there was a man who preached love and tolerance\r\nfive centuries ago to all humanity, and not just to\r\nMuslims? Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and Sikhs also\r\nseek spiritual solace at his grave. The disdainful act of\r\ndesecration of this symbol of peace and harmony by the\r\nIndian forces has not extinguished the spirit of freedom in\r\nKashmir.\r\nThe occupation forces, now numbering more than\r\n600,000, use torture, killings and brutality against the\r\npeople, against its leaders, and even against innocent\r\njournalists. The people of Kashmir were outraged at the\r\nkilling of a journalist, Mushtaq Ali, in the bomb blast at\r\nthe BBC office in Srinagar. The whole of Kashmir went\r\ninto deep mourning at this wanton killing. But India\r\nrefuses to look truth in the face.\r\nThe people of Kashmir and Pakistan are deeply\r\nshocked at the killing of the Norwegian tourist by the\r\nkidnappers of the Al-Faran Group. We join our Kashmiri\r\nbrothers in condemning this horrible act against an\r\ninnocent tourist, and we demand the release of the\r\nremaining four tourists. We have extended every possible\r\ncooperation to countries whose citizens’ lives are still in\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\ndanger, but we have a right to ask: Who are Al-Faran?\r\nNobody seems to have heard of this group ever before.\r\nThere is too much circumstantial evidence which points an\r\naccusing finger at New Delhi. We do not want rhetoric; we\r\ndo not want to score points. We want the safety and the\r\nfreedom of these innocent tourists. Pakistan calls for an\r\nindependent and impartial inquiry into the hostage-taking by\r\nAl-Faran, under the auspices of the United Nations, so that\r\nthose responsible for this act can be brought to justice.\r\nIndia continues to harp on the issue of elections in\r\nJammu and Kashmir. Let it ask the All Parties Hurriyet\r\nConference, the representative party of all Kashmiri\r\norganizations in Jammu and Kashmir and the sole voice of\r\nthe Kashmiri people, whether they want elections, or a\r\nplebiscite and the implementation of the Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nKashmir is an international dispute. India cannot\r\ninternalize it behind the garb of bilateralism. If this “non-\r\nprinciple” was allowed to prevail as the basis for the\r\nsettlement of disputes, then there would be no international\r\nmorality left. There would be no international order, and\r\nthe world community could say farewell to peace. It would\r\nbecome the law of the jungle.\r\nIn the meantime, along the Line of Control in Kashmir\r\nour people are being killed daily and injured by cross-\r\nborder firing and rocketing. Access to over 80,000 of our\r\npeople in the Neelam Valley has been cut off by daily\r\nIndian firing.\r\nIndia claims that Pakistani militants cross into\r\nKashmir. In good faith and in order to ascertain the veracity\r\nof the Indian allegations, I wrote to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council last year asking for the expansion of the\r\nUnited Nations Military Observer Group in India and\r\nPakistan (UNMOGIP) on both sides of the Line of Control.\r\nIndia’s response to this constructive proposal was a firm\r\n“No”. Instead, it deployed 800 troops per kilometre and\r\nbuilt three Security Zones along the Line of Control. I ask:\r\nCan there be cross-border violations after such heavy\r\nfortifications? By what logic can they reject our proposal\r\nfor increasing United Nations observers? The answer is\r\nobvious. They want merely to score points in international\r\nforums. They want to build an argument against Pakistan.\r\nThey want to convince the world that it is not the Kashmiri\r\npeople who are alienated from India, but Pakistan that is\r\nturning a blind eye to militants crossing the Line of Control\r\nfrom our side.\r\nI ask you to ponder this Indian posture. In history\r\nthis has always been the language of the aggressor, of\r\nthose who want to maintain the status quo. I cannot\r\nbelieve that Indian authorities are so naive as to believe\r\nthat the Kashmiri uprising is foreign- inspired. Other\r\nPowers have also made such mistakes in the past, much\r\nto their dismay and ultimate discomfiture. India must\r\nlearn from history. The march of history has never been,\r\nand never will be, altered by a systematic falsification of\r\nfacts or a string of blatant lies. The people of Kashmir\r\nhave rejected the Indian occupation. No amount of\r\nrepression, no amount of killings, gang-rapes, torture or\r\nmining of villages will deter the people of Jammu and\r\nKashmir from winning their right to self-determination.\r\nThis truth is being lost on New Delhi. For our part,\r\nwe are prepared for dialogue. We are prepared for\r\nmediation by the Secretary-General or by the President of\r\nthe Assembly, or by any peace-loving country under any\r\nmodality, under any arrangement.\r\nWe are prepared for peace. We want conflict\r\nresolution. We want talks but the talks must be on the\r\nsubstantive issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Talks must aim\r\nat achieving settlement. Talks must be on the basis of a\r\nstructured agenda. Once the issue of Jammu and Kashmir\r\nis resolved, it will open the door for a solution to all\r\nother Indo-Pakistan disputes. But our offers of talks have\r\nfallen on deaf ears. India now hides behind a new\r\nsubterfuge that talks should be unconditional, that talks\r\nmust be without an agenda. We cannot accept this\r\nbecause during the last 23 years under the Simla\r\nAgreement, the two Foreign Secretaries met seven times\r\nwithout any result. Every time a meeting takes place the\r\nIndian side states that Kashmir is an integral part of India\r\nand not an international dispute. This is a negation of the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions. This is a\r\nnegation of the Simla Agreement, and I quote article 6 of\r\nthe Simla Agreement, which states,\r\n“Both Governments agree ... to discuss further the\r\nmodalities and arrangements for the establishment of\r\ndurable peace and of normalization of relations”,\r\nincluding\r\n“a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir”.\r\nThe Simla Agreement is fully within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nThen we are told that the Security Council resolutions\r\nare outdated. What will the world look like if countries\r\nwere allowed unilaterally to reject United Nations\r\nresolutions, and if this deviationist stance were to become\r\na universal principle of international morality? Can morality\r\nbecome outdated? Can evil become good with time?\r\nInstead, India has gone on to a feverish arms race.\r\nWhen they exploded their nuclear bomb in 1974, we told\r\nthem not to push South Asia into a nuclear arms race. But\r\nour warnings were not heeded and now, along with its\r\nmassive blue-water navy, which threatens the shores of\r\nAfrica and Asia, they have launched into an arms race in\r\nSouth Asia. Their Prithvi missiles are Pakistan-specific. The\r\nPrithvi missile is a tension multiplier: it gives Pakistan only\r\nthree minutes’ response time.\r\nWhat are they arming themselves for? Who threatens\r\nthem in Asia? Their leaders talk of extending the Indian\r\nmilitary and naval might to the shores of the Indian Ocean.\r\nIn this day and age this approach is downright\r\nanachronistic.\r\nDuring the Eighth Summit of the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which was\r\nheld in New Delhi in May this year, President Leghari\r\nurged Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and the Indian\r\nleadership not to take this fateful step. He urged the Indian\r\nleadership to come to the table and solve the core Kashmir\r\ndispute. He also warned that if India continued with this\r\nfeverish race for arms, and now for missiles, then Pakistan\r\nwould have no choice but to rethink its options within the\r\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).\r\nHaving fought three wars to defend its territory, the\r\npeople of Pakistan feel threatened. That is why peace is\r\nimportant. That is why peace is vital for Pakistan. But I\r\nwant to make it absolutely clear — and let there be no\r\ndoubt about it in anyone’s mind — that the people of\r\nPakistan have the will to survive, and survive they will with\r\ndignity and honour.\r\nOne fifth of humanity, a billion people, live in the\r\nseven countries of South Asia. The world is passing us by.\r\nOur people are trapped in poverty, in hunger, in disease and\r\nunemployment. Don’t our people deserve better? Don’t they\r\ndeserve a chance? Don’t six countries have a right to live\r\nin peace in South Asia? It is our earnest hope that those in\r\nNew Delhi who threaten war should look at the state of\r\npoverty of their own people. We hope that they have the\r\npolitical will to ensure the peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\nand there will be many peace dividends if peace comes to\r\nSouth Asia.\r\nPeace will be worth their while. Trade will flourish,\r\nmega- projects in the Gulf, from Iran and from Central\r\nAsia will bring prosperity to our peoples. I hope that\r\nbetter counsel will prevail in New Delhi and I hope there\r\nare still men of peace and vision left in India who will\r\nnot be the prisoners of the acrimonies of history but will\r\nlook to the future of a billion people.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his 1995 report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/50/1), has recognized the\r\naggravation of relations between India and Pakistan as a\r\nresult of increasing incidents of violence in Jammu and\r\nKashmir. We would like, in particular, to facilitate the\r\nsearch for a lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute. We\r\nhope that India will also accept the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General’s offer of good offices, as Pakistan has\r\ndone. We also sincerely hope that the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly will use its authority to exert pressure\r\non India to stop immediately the brutal violations of\r\nhuman rights and to implement the Security Council\r\nresolutions which ask for the holding of a plebiscite in\r\nJammu and Kashmir.\r\nWhat has been happening in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina for the past few years is a monumental\r\ntragedy. The world has witnessed a Member State of the\r\nUnited Nations being made victim of brutal aggression\r\nand its people subjected to atrocities, massive violations\r\nof human rights, ethnic cleansing and the abhorrent\r\npractice of genocide — acts which would put the horrors\r\nof the Second World War to shame. The killing fields of\r\nSrebrenica and Zepa are sadly reminiscent of Auschwitz\r\nand Buchenwald. Yet the international response has been\r\ntotally inadequate and has often come too late. The\r\nBosnian Muslims were left to defend themselves against\r\na vastly superior military machine, their hands tied by an\r\nunjustified arms embargo.\r\nPakistan strongly reiterates its firm support for the\r\ndemand by the Bosnian people for the lifting of the arms\r\nembargo. For its part, Pakistan remains strongly\r\ncommitted to offering every possible assistance to the\r\npeople and Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\r\nmust seek credible international guarantees for the\r\npreservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nIf one step is taken towards peace, the world of\r\nIslam is prepared to take two steps more. We have taken\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nnote of the action taken by the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) countries and of the establishment of\r\nthe rapid reaction force. We urge the NATO countries not\r\nto relent on the air strikes until the Serbian aggressors and\r\ndelinquents are made to pay a price for their deeds and to\r\nact like civilized people. Unless peace is fully restored and\r\na just and equitable settlement is in place, the OIC will\r\nreserve its right to challenge the illegal United Nations arms\r\nembargo on the Bosnian people.\r\nWe fully support the Croatian efforts to recover\r\nKrajina and their other territories from Serbian military\r\noccupation. We demand that in the settlement Srebrenica\r\nand Zepa be restored to their original United Nations-\r\ndesignated safe-area status. We also demand that Kosovo\r\nand Sanjak be protected from Serbian “ethnic cleansing”.\r\nThe Declaration of Principles signed recently in Geneva is\r\nsomething we consider well-begun but only half-done.\r\nThere are many pitfalls, and we see many dangers in the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Principles. A lot more\r\nvision and courage on the part of the world community will\r\nbe required if the entire peace plan is to be fully\r\nimplemented. We hope that the United Nations, the\r\nEuropean Union and NATO will demonstrate the courage\r\nrequired to resolve the crisis in the Balkans.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan makes us very sad. The\r\npeople of Afghanistan wait in anguish for peace to return\r\nto their tortured land. There appears to be no end to the\r\nfighting between the various groups. One and a half million\r\nAfghans are still in my country. They too, like us, look to\r\nthe United Nations and to the OIC to bring peace to their\r\nland.\r\nI should like to state here unequivocally, and with all\r\nthe responsibility at our command, that in no way have we\r\ninterfered in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. We would\r\nalso urge that no other country do so. We would urge other\r\nStates not to increase the suffering of the Afghan people by\r\nsupporting one group or the other. We should all support\r\nUnited Nations Special Representative Mahmoud Mestiri’s\r\nmission to bring peace to Afghanistan, a peace based on\r\naccommodation for all factions and all groups. This peace\r\ncan be achieved only through mutual accommodation and\r\nnational reconciliation. In the last 18 months, our Mission\r\nhas twice been subjected to mob attacks. In the second one,\r\n26 of our officials were injured, including Ambassador Qazi\r\nHumayun, and one staffer was killed. This is most\r\nunfortunate. We hope that the sanctity of the Mission will\r\nbe respected and that the Vienna Conventions will be\r\nhonoured.\r\nFor over a decade, Pakistan supported the legitimate\r\nstruggle of our Afghan brothers against foreign\r\nintervention. Once this intervention was ended, Pakistan\r\npromoted accords among the Afghan parties and factions\r\nfor a peaceful transition from war to peace. It was as a\r\nconsequence of the compromise achieved in the\r\nIslamabad accord of May 1992 that President Rabbani\r\ntook office. His Government was to be a transitional one\r\nand was to prepare for a broad-based and popular\r\ngovernment representing all regions and political forces in\r\nAfghanistan. Unfortunately, as the Secretary- General’s\r\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Mestiri, has clearly stated, the\r\nregime in Kabul did not allow the promised transition to\r\na representative government to take place.\r\nIn large measure because of this refusal to live up to\r\nsolemn agreements, fighting in Afghanistan has been\r\nendemic during the past few years. The fortunes of war\r\nrecently turned against President Rabbani’s regime\r\nbecause it became increasingly unpopular with the Afghan\r\npeople. A regime in Kabul whose de facto legitimacy we\r\nhave not questioned, a regime in Kabul that today\r\ncontrols only 5 of about 32 provinces in Afghanistan: this\r\nregime has tested our patience again and again.\r\nThis regime chooses to punish unarmed and innocent\r\nstaffers and the Ambassador. It chooses to burn down our\r\nEmbassy and its premises. But this has not made\r\nPakistanis angry at the Afghan nation. It has merely made\r\nus sad, because this regime has forgotten the 14 years of\r\nthe support given and the sacrifices made by the people\r\nof Pakistan for their freedom. Instead, it chooses to please\r\nthose who destroyed their country, who killed and\r\nmaimed millions of Afghan men, women and children,\r\nwho destroyed houses, who destroyed people’s lives, who\r\nplanted millions of land-mines across the country — a\r\nlarge number of which have yet to be removed. By these\r\nwanton acts, which go against the Vienna Conventions,\r\nthe Kabul regime wants to win the favour of those who\r\nseek to fish in the troubled waters of Afghanistan.\r\nThe Kabul regime seeks to survive with the help of\r\nmilitary support from the enemies of the Afghan nation,\r\nwhile it rules through a minority. It seeks to conquer\r\nAfghanistan through military force. This is against\r\nhistory. This will not happen. The regime is forgetting the\r\ncode of honour of the Afghan nation. While we in\r\nPakistan are sad at what has happened to our countrymen\r\nin Kabul, the chivalrous Afghan people are angered and\r\nincensed. We take no responsibility for what the Afghan\r\npeople will do to vindicate their honour. They know that\r\nthere never was, and never will be, interference from\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nPakistan. The world knows that a faltering regime always\r\nwants to lay its follies and its internal defeats at the\r\ndoorsteps of others, and for this the Afghan nation will\r\ndemand, and get, retribution.\r\nHowever, this provocation will not deter us from our\r\nsteadfast path of neutrality towards the Afghan people and\r\nthe unity of Afghanistan or from non-interference in\r\nAfghanistan’s internal affairs or our abiding friendship and\r\nbrotherhood with the Afghan nation. In the meantime, we\r\nwould like to assure the people of Afghanistan that we shall\r\nstand by them in their hour of trial. We shall not abandon\r\nthem.\r\nPakistan was closely associated with the third round of\r\nUnited Nations-sponsored inter-Tajik talks. While I pay\r\ntribute to the United Nations Special Representative,\r\nAmbassador Píriz-Ballón, for his statesmanship, which led\r\nto the main elements for peace in Tajikistan, let me add\r\nthat our role too was to bring about national reconciliation\r\nin that country. We shall continue to cooperate with the\r\nUnited Nations to bring about complete peace in our\r\nfriendly neighbour Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Kulla (Albania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe events in Azerbaijan, too, are a matter of deep\r\nconcern to us. We fully support the efforts of President\r\nGaider Aliyev for an equitable settlement of the Nagorny-\r\nKarabakh dispute; a settlement which is based on the\r\nremoval of aggression against Azerbaijan.\r\nWe fully support the Middle East peace process. We\r\nhope that the Palestine Liberation Organization-Israeli\r\naccord is implemented in letter and spirit without any\r\nrecourse to delay by Israel. We have supported the Jordan-\r\nIsraeli peace accord and favour a negotiated settlement of\r\nrelated issues, especially the Golan Heights, southern\r\nLebanon and Jerusalem.\r\nPakistan continues to be deeply concerned over the\r\nsituation in Somalia. The United Nations, along with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the Arab League and the\r\nOrganization of Islamic Conference must endeavour to\r\npromote an early political solution in that country and its\r\neventual reconstruction.\r\nIn other areas which impinge on the peace and\r\nstability of the world can be seen the lack of progress in\r\nthe field of disarmament of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nparticularly in the field of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe end of the bipolar world based on hostile camps\r\nhas removed the impediments to pursuing the goal of\r\nnuclear disarmament. Yet the goal remains elusive. It is\r\nincomprehensible why commitments cannot be translated\r\ninto reality. The agreements reached on the reduction of\r\nstrategic arms still fall far short of the expectations raised\r\nby the end of the cold war. The world should resolve to\r\nremove the scourge of nuclear weapons from the face of\r\nthis earth.\r\nUntil nuclear disarmament is realized, the nuclear-\r\nweapon States should give unconditional security\r\nassurances to the non-nuclear-weapon States. In this\r\ncontext, the Conference on Disarmament should establish\r\nan ad hoc committee right at the beginning of 1996 to\r\nnegotiate a legally binding convention on security\r\nassurances. The Conference on Disarmament should also\r\ncontinue its work on a comprehensive test-ban treaty for\r\nits early conclusion.\r\nParallel to all these global efforts, regional avenues\r\nshould be promoted for nuclear non-proliferation. The\r\nconcept of nuclear-weapon-free zones is finally being\r\ntranslated into reality in different parts of the world.\r\nUnfortunately, the proposal Pakistan made 20 years ago\r\nto establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia has\r\nnot even taken off because of the negative attitude of\r\ncertain States in the region. Nevertheless, Pakistan has\r\ncontinued to advocate efforts to eliminate the dangers of\r\nproliferation from South Asia. To that end, we have made\r\nseveral suggestions. Regrettably, they have not evoked a\r\npositive response from India.\r\nPakistan has also proposed conventional\r\ndisarmament at the regional and subregional levels. We\r\nhope that the Conference on Disarmament will deliberate\r\nupon this approach and evolve guidelines to bring at par\r\nthe weaponry and forces of the regional States.\r\nIn our view, the emerging role of the United Nations\r\nas a peace maker and a peace-keeper would greatly help\r\nin achieving peace and harmony at the regional as well as\r\nthe global levels. We believe that preventive diplomacy is\r\nthe cornerstone of United Nations peace efforts. Pakistan\r\nhas been actively cooperating and participating in a major\r\nway in United Nations peace-keeping efforts. It is a\r\nmatter of immense satisfaction that today Pakistan is the\r\nthird largest troop-contributing country to United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nPakistan believes that certain operational realities\r\nmust be justified for the success of such operations. We\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nneed a clear commitment from the international community,\r\naccompanied by a clear political direction and a unified\r\ncommand structure.\r\nIn order to ensure better and effective implementation\r\nof Security Council resolutions, there is a need for thorough\r\nconsultations between the members of the Council, as well\r\nas actual troop-contributing countries and the Secretariat, at\r\nall stages of any peace-keeping operation.\r\nAs we enter the new millennium, our collective\r\nobjective should be to maximize economic growth leading\r\ntowards the ultimate objective of human development. To\r\npromote peace and prosperity, it is essential to facilitate\r\nrather than restrain the application of modern technology\r\nfor economic and social development.\r\nAdequate official resources should be channelled to\r\nthose developing countries which are implementing far-\r\nreaching economic reforms and liberalization measures. A\r\nnet flow of official assistance should be directed in\r\nparticular towards the eradication of poverty, human and\r\nsocial development programmes and sustainable growth in\r\nthe developing countries. This is particularly true of Africa,\r\na continent which has been largely bypassed by the\r\neconomics of the twentieth century. For our part, Pakistan\r\nextends full support to the United Nations development\r\nassistance plans for Africa and for the Sahel.\r\nPakistan is encouraged by the conclusion of the\r\nUruguay Round, despite the partial and unequal response to\r\nthe trade interests of the developing countries. The global\r\neconomy is finally coming out of recession. New growth is\r\nlikely to be generated mostly in the developing countries,\r\nwhose integration into the world’s financial and trading\r\nsystem can immensely contribute towards global output.\r\nThere is, therefore, a unique opportunity to create a just,\r\nfair, equitable and non-discriminatory global economy.\r\nFree markets and open economies do not imply a\r\ndisregard for the plight of the poor and the disadvantaged.\r\nThis principle must be applied as much among nations as\r\nwithin nations. The aim must be to improve living\r\nconditions for all within a dynamic economic framework.\r\nPakistan welcomes the constructive outcome of the recently\r\nheld Conference on Population and Development, the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women.\r\nWe in Pakistan are particularly aware of the need to\r\naddress the problems of the deprived segments of our\r\nsociety. Development initiatives, such as the Social Action\r\nProgramme, are being formulated within the constitutional\r\nframework. Our Constitution contains a number of articles\r\nrelated to social integration with particular reference to\r\nwomen and children and religious and ethnic minorities,\r\nas well as those living in poverty. Special efforts are\r\nbeing made to ensure the full participation of women in\r\nnation building. Pakistan’s approach to employment and\r\npoverty eradication combines policies for national growth,\r\nemployment and price stabilization with programmes that\r\ntarget the poor and the vulnerable.\r\nPakistan would like to reiterate the importance it has\r\nalways attached to the reform of the United Nations.\r\nPakistan supports the reaffirmation made by the Non-\r\nAligned Movement that both the reform and expansion\r\naspects of the Security Council should take into account\r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States and\r\nequitable geographical distribution, as well as the need for\r\ntransparency, accountability and democratization in the\r\nworking methods and procedures of the Security Council.\r\nPakistan remains strongly opposed to centres of privilege\r\nwithin the United Nations system. These are\r\nanachronistic, anti-democratic and contrary to the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality.\r\nIn conclusion, the challenges that Member States of\r\nthe United Nations confront are indeed forbidding. Yet\r\nthe opportunities for genuine peace and universal\r\nprosperity are most promising. With good will and\r\ncooperation, all Member States can make significant\r\nprogress at this historic session towards the vision of\r\npeace, progress and human solidarity envisaged in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. This is an extraordinary\r\nmoment of opportunity. The decisions we take today will\r\ndetermine whether the new era will be one of hope and\r\nprosperity or one of despair and deprivation. The choices\r\nto build a peaceful world are therefore entirely in our own\r\nhands.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship of\r\nArgentina, His Excellency Mr. Guido di Tella.\r\nMr. Di Tella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Our presence here at the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly holds a very special meaning. On this\r\noccasion, we are not gathered here simply to reenact the\r\nannual ritual of exchanging views and official national\r\npositions on the principal problems that encumber the\r\ninternational agenda. These first 50 years during which\r\nthe Organization has carried out its noble task have been\r\nmarked by successes and disappointments.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nAs President Menem said in this very forum a year\r\nago, the real situation in the world today offers a balance\r\nof light and shadow in which encouraging signs of\r\nconvergence exist alongside other signs that seem to point\r\nto the persistence of injustice and disagreement. The search\r\nfor a delicate balance of peace and security with\r\ndevelopment and social justice is the goal which we must\r\nconstantly pursue. This search must be translated into\r\nconcrete facts which demonstrate on this anniversary,\r\nthrough the actions of each and every Member State, the\r\nextent to which we have faithfully respected the spirit and\r\nthe letter of the Charter.\r\nAt this historic moment, my country has chosen\r\nactively to involve itself in the resolution of serious\r\ninternational crises through the concerted action of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe tragic situation in the Balkans has found\r\nArgentina present in solidarity, through its troops, in search\r\nof a space for dialogue and understanding after five years\r\nof blood and fire. Today we are witnessing the rebirth of\r\nhope, starting with the recent Geneva agreements and those\r\nthat were signed yesterday. We hope that the peoples of the\r\nnew republics of the Balkans can, once and for all, begin\r\nlife again in peace after such enormous suffering, so much\r\nviolence and so many unnecessary deaths.\r\nThe Middle East has suffered the attacks of\r\nextremism; yet the peace process initiated in 1993 forges\r\nahead. On behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nArgentina, I pay a tribute to the leaders of Israel and the\r\nPalestinian people, who, despite provocations and the\r\nlegitimate grievances of those who suffer, have managed to\r\nfix their eyes on the future and continue the task of\r\nconcluding agreements on each of the points that comprise\r\nthe complex agenda for peace in the Middle East.\r\nWe cannot forget our African brothers and sisters, who\r\nhave been affected by situations in which political struggles\r\nand the survival of the least fortunate are combined in a\r\nmost dramatic fashion. It is precisely in those situations that\r\nwe must reaffirm our contribution and our solidarity,\r\nbecause we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering and\r\ndeprivation of so many human beings without neglecting\r\nthe commitments dictated to us by the Charter and imposed\r\nupon us by human solidarity. To the extent of our ability,\r\nwe maintain our participation in the solution of such\r\nproblems as those of Western Sahara, Mozambique and\r\nAngola, a neighbour country of ours in the South Atlantic\r\nwith which we will cooperate actively in the United Nations\r\nAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).\r\nThe case of Haiti warrants my particular\r\nconsideration, since it deals with an issue that directly\r\naffects our region of Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nToday, I would like to express the Argentine\r\nGovernment’s great pleasure at the successful process that\r\nculminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n940 (1994). Only through that resolution could the\r\nGovernment legitimately elected by the Haitian people be\r\nreestablished — a Government which, with moving\r\nendurance and commitment, is restoring institutional\r\nnormalcy and again moving ahead on the road to\r\neconomic development.\r\nArgentina is proud of its character as a Latin\r\nAmerican nation. In just a few days, we will have the\r\nhigh honour of hosting the Fifth Ibero-American Summit,\r\nat which all the nations of our region, together with their\r\nrespective mother countries, all linked by a common\r\nhistory and culture, will set an inspiring example of\r\ndialogue and cooperation in the search for solutions\r\nadapted to our present reality. It is precisely this reality\r\nand the prospects we envisage for it that make us look\r\nwith optimism to a Latin American future based on\r\ndemocracy, peace and integration.\r\nThe Argentine commitment to peace was recently\r\ndemonstrated once again through the active exercise of\r\nthe role mandated to us, together with Brazil, Chile and\r\nthe United States of America, as guarantors of the 1942\r\nRio Protocol, in an effort to bring the peoples of Ecuador\r\nand Peru together once and for all.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nBuilding upon political and economic stability,\r\nambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed\r\nthat contribute to consolidating the opening of our\r\neconomies, the transparency of our markets, and the\r\ngrowth of commercial exchange with other regions — in\r\nshort, the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a\r\nbetter future for our peoples.\r\nIn our case, we have made the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (Mercosur) a priority in our foreign\r\npolicy, with the understanding not only that its\r\nstrengthening will boost our economy and those of its\r\nmember countries, but also, and most especially, that it is\r\nthanks to this open approach that the men and women of\r\nour country and our region can come together today in an\r\natmosphere of economic growth after so many years of\r\ndisillusionment and frustration.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nIn Argentina, we place special emphasis on the\r\nfollowing principles: good governance; the struggle against\r\ncorruption; discipline in fiscal matters; accountability in the\r\nmanagement of public finances; respect for human rights;\r\nlegal equality for foreign investments; and full authority for\r\ninstitutions within the rule of law. These are the principles\r\nthat form the framework designed to give a greater boost to\r\neconomic activity as a necessary motor for the well-being\r\nof the Argentina people.\r\nThis framework of recovery and harmony within Latin\r\nAmerica, however, raises important issues which remain\r\nunresolved.\r\nIn the South Atlantic, the dispute concerning\r\nsovereignty over the Malvinas, South Georgia and South\r\nSandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime spaces has\r\nnot yet been resolved. We will not cite yet again the\r\nnumerous resolutions in which the General Assembly and\r\nthe decolonization Committee have categorically and\r\nrepeatedly stated their position on this matter. Let me\r\nsimply recall that all of these include a clear and direct\r\nappeal to the two countries involved — Argentina and the\r\nUnited Kingdom — to reach a negotiated settlement of this\r\ndispute. This appeal from the Assembly remains unheeded,\r\ndespite the willingness we have constantly shown and the\r\nexcellent relations that bind our two countries. This makes\r\nthe issue even more baffling.\r\nIn spite of this, we maintain a cooperative effort with\r\nregard to the exploitation of fishing resources in the area in\r\nan attempt to protect the biomass and at the same time\r\nensure that significant economic activity continues.\r\nWith regard to oil, given the non-renewable character\r\nof the resources and the existence of a consolidated\r\ninternational doctrine which proscribes the unilateral\r\nexploitation of disputed resources, we are reaching a\r\ntemporary understanding that allows us to engage in further\r\nexploration and exploitation while avoiding the creation of\r\nnew sources of tension which might discourage initiatives\r\nfrom the private sector.\r\nThis very morning we and the United Kingdom\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,\r\nMalcolm Rifkind, signed a joint declaration which will\r\nallow us to move forward together in this spirit.\r\nWith respect to the inhabitants of the islands, I repeat\r\nour determination to guarantee total respect for their way of\r\nlife, their culture, habits and institutions.\r\nThe dispute over the Malvinas Islands will not\r\ndisappear as if by magic. The peaceful recovery of the\r\nexercise of full sovereignty over all the territories in\r\ndispute and the surrounding waters, and respect for the\r\nway of life of the islands’ inhabitants, are today part of\r\nArgentina’s Constitution, on which there was consensus\r\nacross the entire political spectrum of my country. Only\r\nrational dialogue, without any a priori conditions from\r\neither party, will permit us to make progress towards the\r\nfinal implementation of the resolutions of the Assembly\r\nand of the Decolonization Committee.\r\nAt the end of this year Argentina will conclude its\r\nterm as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.\r\nIn our two years as a member we have witnessed\r\nnumerous situations that have required an immediate\r\nresponse on the part of the Council. Responding to these\r\nsituations has not been an easy task, and at times the\r\nserious problems that have given rise to them have failed\r\nto receive full attention. Nevertheless, the Council’s\r\nresponse has confirmed on each occasion its character as\r\nthe central and indispensable instrument for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nOur commitment to the work of the Council has not\r\nbeen limited to its discussions; it has extended to\r\nArgentina’s contribution to peace-keeping operations, the\r\nlargest in our region. Our presence in the former\r\nYugoslavia, in Cyprus, Mozambique, Haiti and Kuwait —\r\nto name but a few operations — is tangible proof of our\r\nconcrete, and not just rhetorical, contribution to\r\ninternational peace and cooperation.\r\nIn recent days much has been said about the process\r\nof reform of the Security Council. If anything has been\r\nproved by the extended deliberations of the ad hoc Open-\r\nended Working Group established for this purpose, it is\r\nthe extreme difficulty of finding a formula, acceptable to\r\neveryone, that does not introduce imbalances into the\r\nregion.\r\nIn our delegation’s view, the fundamental task in this\r\nrespect is to protect and improve the efficiency and\r\nexpeditiousness of the Council. In order to achieve this,\r\na careful, limited increase in the membership would be in\r\norder, should there be the necessary consensus. This\r\nincrease could be supplemented with a new procedure\r\naimed at achieving a greater representativeness, which, by\r\nmeans of rotation mechanisms, would enable several of\r\nthe most interested countries of different regions, as well\r\nas those which stand to wait many years before joining\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nthe Council, to take part more regularly in its deliberations.\r\nWe believe that those countries which are legitimately\r\ninterested in taking part in the daily construction of a stable\r\nand peaceful world order could fulfil their aspirations in\r\nthis way.\r\nMoreover, further changes in the procedure of the\r\nCouncil should be introduced in order to increase its\r\ntransparency and strengthen the process of dialogue and\r\nexchange of information. Over the past two years we have\r\nactively promoted such progress, being convinced that the\r\ncontribution of the international community to the solution\r\nof its crises would be facilitated if all its members had\r\nmore criteria and information on which to base their\r\ndecisions.\r\nThis matter is of undeniable importance, since the\r\nSecurity Council is the body ultimately entrusted with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This\r\nrequires that we proceed with the utmost care, searching\r\nrelentlessly for consensus.\r\nThis year has been marked by the positive contribution\r\nto international peace made here in New York, when the\r\n179 States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), decided to extend it\r\nunconditionally and indefinitely. We are concerned about\r\nthe ongoing nuclear-test programmes. Therefore, we look\r\nforward to the prompt conclusion of the comprehensive\r\nnuclear-test-ban treaty, without exceptions or permissible\r\nthresholds. Likewise, we hope that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament will address without delay the negotiation of\r\na convention banning the production of fissionable material.\r\nIt is encouraging to note the increased awareness of\r\nwhat the Secretary-General has rightly called the\r\n“international humanitarian crisis” of anti-personnel mines.\r\nWe trust that the 1981 Convention on inhumane weapons\r\nwill be strengthened as a result of the meeting to be held in\r\nVienna in the next few days.For our part, in addition to\r\nsupporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject, we\r\nhave declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production,\r\nand with regard to a case which affects us directly — the\r\nmines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islands\r\nin 1982 — we have offered our cooperation and financial\r\nhelp to the United Kingdom for their removal, which is\r\nproceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of the\r\nUnited States.\r\nApart from the struggle for the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, new challenges to peace and\r\nstability, including international terrorism, have emerged.\r\nToday no one can feel safe from the action of groups\r\nwhich are international in structure and very often rely on\r\nthe active or passive support of certain States. Almost\r\nevery day gruesome attacks reflect the reality of this new\r\nthreat, which calls for a determined and unequivocal\r\nresponse by the international community.\r\nWe have drawn this issue to the attention of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we are confident that as a result\r\nurgent action at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels will be taken to promote legislative harmonization\r\nand cooperation in the judicial, police and even\r\nintelligence spheres, in order to halt this insidious\r\nmanifestation of terror.\r\nHowever, the pressing challenges requiring\r\ninternational action are not restricted to the domain of\r\nsecurity. Emergency assistance activities and the\r\nsubsequent stage of rehabilitation for development\r\nconstitute a priority task for the United Nations. For this\r\nreason, in 1994 we proposed the “White Helmets”\r\ninitiative, which aims to deliver assistance in cases of\r\nextreme urgency and to mobilize resources for specific\r\ninstances of extreme poverty. We are pleased to note that\r\nthe initiative was adopted by consensus in resolution\r\n49/139 B, with the formidable support of 67 co-sponsors.\r\nIn the future we will further define details of the\r\ninitiative, which has already been implemented in very\r\nsuccessful pilot projects in our region. We hope to extend\r\nthis initiative to other parts of the world where even\r\ngreater need is experienced.\r\nFrom a historical perspective, 50 years may not be\r\nmany, but they are not insignificant in the life of an\r\ninternational organization that every day has to address\r\nnumerous and complex issues. Today we find the United\r\nNations committed to the solution of international crises\r\nwhich affect international peace and security, a far cry\r\nfrom the marginalization of the Organization during the\r\ncold war. The United Nations is actively involved in\r\nadvances on great social issues by means of international\r\nconferences such as those of Vienna, on human rights;\r\nCairo, on population; Copenhagen, on social matters; and\r\nBeijing, on women.\r\nThese meetings reflect the new and vigorous stage\r\nreached by multilateralism, which elicits universally\r\naccepted responses to the great currents of sustainable\r\nhuman development, and acts in strict conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the Charter, under which the promotion of\r\nhuman welfare, development and dignity are harmonious\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFiftieth session 27 September 1995\r\nand mutually complementary priorities. We remain actively\r\ncommitted to work to achieve these priorities in the\r\nframework of the United Nations, thus renewing the\r\ncommitment of 1945, towards which the current reform\r\nprocess will make a substantive contribution, with the same\r\nfaith we had then, nourished by decades of cooperation.\r\nThe year 1995 is not only the year that marks the half\r\ncentury of the United Nations. Two years ago the General\r\nAssembly, in its resolution 48/126, declared 1995 the\r\nUnited Nations Year for Tolerance. It occurs to me that the\r\nforefathers of the United Nations must have had the idea of\r\ntolerance deeply etched in their minds when they set the\r\nfoundations of this unique endeavour.\r\nInternational reality reminds us how often we forget\r\ntolerance, how often we reject, proscribe or ignore others\r\nfor what they are, think, say or do, or simply for existing.\r\nMay this anniversary be a timely occasion to remember the\r\nneed to reaffirm in our minds, in the education of our\r\nchildren and in our acts, tolerance, and, with it, the culture\r\nof peace.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
