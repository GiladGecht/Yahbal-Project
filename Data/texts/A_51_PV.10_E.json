(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, His Excellency\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Clerides: I would like to begin by\r\nextending to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. We are\r\ncertain that your long experience, outstanding ability and\r\ndiplomatic skill will guide us successfully in our work at\r\nthis fifty-first session of the General Assembly. Allow me\r\nalso to thank your predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral, for his untiring efforts during the previous\r\nsession.\r\nAt last year’s session, which marked the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we reflected on the birth\r\nof the United Nations, assessed its development and\r\ninfluence on international relations to date, paid tribute to\r\nits achievements and identified some of its difficulties. At\r\nthe same time, we acknowledged that our main\r\nresponsibility for the future of the Organization is to\r\ninsure that it has the ability to address most effectively\r\nthe agenda of the twenty-first century.\r\nIn the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations, we agreed that\r\n“In order to be able to respond effectively to\r\nthe challenges of the future and the expectations of\r\nthe United Nations held by peoples around the\r\nworld, it is essential that the United Nations itself be\r\nreformed and modernized.” (resolution 50/6,\r\npara. 14)\r\nNow, as we begin the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we should take stock of what we have\r\nbeen able to accomplish and redirect our efforts to what\r\nremains to be achieved.\r\nIn 1996, we have continued our work towards the\r\ninstitutional and financial reforms needed to make the\r\nUnited Nations a more productive and dynamic institution\r\nso that it will be better able to perform its key functions\r\nand fulfil its mandates more effectively. In this regard, the\r\nfundamental priority must be to ensure that the financing\r\nof our Organization is placed on a firm and lasting base.\r\nMay I recall in this context that the Government of\r\nthe Republic of Cyprus is voluntarily contributing one\r\nthird of the total cost of the United Nations Peace-keeping\r\nForce in Cyprus and, in addition, has increased by one\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nthird its contribution to United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations in general.\r\nDuring 1996, various high-level working groups of the\r\nGeneral Assembly have continued their efforts on the\r\ninstitutional and financial reforms of the United Nations. I\r\nwould like to reiterate that we consider the work of these\r\nworking groups, covering a very broad spectrum of issues,\r\nto be extremely important. Such issues, ranging from the\r\nstrengthening of the main United Nations organs to the\r\nfurther development of an Agenda for Peace and an Agenda\r\nfor Development, deserve deep and profound priority\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe subscribe to the need to reform the Security\r\nCouncil, to expand it and strengthen its capacity to\r\ndischarge the duties assigned to it by the Charter for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As for the\r\nreform of its working methods, we recognize, that although\r\nsignificant efforts have been made over the past two years\r\nto ensure greater transparency and broader consultations\r\nwith non-members, more remains to be done. A good\r\nprecedent has been established with the holding of briefings\r\nand regular consultations, including those with countries\r\nthat contribute troops to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nThe reports of the working groups of the General\r\nAssembly and the proposals from Member States that we\r\nhave before us provide a good basis for further work. We\r\nall understand and accept the need to reform and revitalize\r\nour Organization. Our responsibility, then, is quite clear:\r\nLet us make even more vigorous efforts and display the\r\ncourage and political will required to reach a successful\r\nconclusion on these issues.\r\nThis year’s international conferences — HABITAT II,\r\nthe World Food Summit and the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development — have marked the completion\r\nof a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsored\r\nconferences which covered the full range of civil, political,\r\neconomic and social issues that affect the peoples of the\r\nworld. We attach great importance to the successful\r\nfollow-up to United Nations-sponsored conferences and\r\ntheir impact on those areas of the world where the lack of\r\neconomic and social development often contributes to\r\nconflict. In this respect, we welcome next year’s General\r\nAssembly special session, which will be devoted to the\r\nassessment and review of Agenda 21 and of the results of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. It will be a unique opportunity to take stock\r\nof what we have done so far to implement the\r\nrecommendations agreed upon in that all-important\r\nConference.\r\nAn area of particular concern in today’s world is the\r\npersistent violation of human rights. The human rights\r\nagenda has for many years been dominated by efforts to\r\nestablish international standards. Our duty must be to\r\nimplement these standards unequivocally and to take a\r\nfirm stand against all forms of human rights violations in\r\nall cases. The full implementation of the commitments\r\nentered into will encourage those around the world who\r\nbelieve in the promise of the United Nations to help\r\nrestore and keep the peace, to promote respect for human\r\nrights, to expand and broaden social progress, and to help\r\nthose in urgent need. My country is fully committed to\r\nthe universal application and promotion of these\r\nprinciples.\r\nAnother area of particular concern to Member States\r\nis arms control and disarmament. Under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations, the nuclear non-proliferation regime\r\nhas been further strengthened by the indefinite extension\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons. We warmly welcome the adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty. This represents the international community’s\r\ndetermination to bring to completion one of the most\r\nsought-after nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nmeasures in the history of the United Nations. But the\r\nTreaty is not the end of the process. There is need for\r\nfurther systematic and progressive effort in order to\r\nachieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons and of general and complete disarmament under\r\nstrict and effective international control.\r\nAnother important development in the field of\r\ndisarmament and arms control is progress achieved\r\ntowards the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention. Cyprus is in the final stages of ratifying this\r\nConvention. It is our hope that it will soon enter into\r\nforce. While recognizing that much more needs to be\r\ndone in the realm of conventional weapons, we are\r\nencouraged by the progress made during the review of the\r\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\r\nto Be Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate\r\nEffects and the agreement on Guidelines for international\r\narms transfers at this year’s United Nations Disarmament\r\nCommission’s session.\r\nWe fully share the view espoused by many that arms\r\ncontrol and disarmament are and will continue to be\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nessential components of international security, contributing\r\nto confidence-building and conflict resolution. It is in this\r\nspirit that we proposed, as part of a comprehensive solution\r\nto the Cyprus problem, the complete demilitarization of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus, in which we have offered to disband\r\nthe National Guard of Cyprus and hand over all weapons to\r\nan international force in exchange for the complete\r\nwithdrawal of all foreign troops, as demanded by the\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nThis body is familiar with the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport which characterizes the northern occupied part of\r\nCyprus as one of the most densely militarized areas in the\r\nworld. The presence of 35,000 Turkish troops and hundreds\r\nof tanks and other armaments constitutes a clear and\r\npresent danger to peace and security in Cyprus and in the\r\nregion. Recent events in Cyprus have highlighted this clear\r\ndanger as well as the urgent need to implement our\r\ndemilitarization proposal. This year’s twenty-second\r\nanniversary of the invasion and occupation of substantial\r\nterritory of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkish forces was\r\nmarked by the brutal killings of two Greek-Cypriot\r\nunarmed demonstrators, witnessed on television screens by\r\nthe entire world, and the wounding of many others,\r\nincluding two United Nations peace-keepers, by the Turkish\r\noccupation troops and Turkish extremists imported from\r\nmainland Turkey to the occupied part of the island.\r\nTwo United Nations reports on these tragic incidents\r\nstate clearly that the responsibility lies with Turkey and the\r\nillegal Turkish-Cypriot regime, which used excessive and\r\nunwarranted force against unarmed demonstrators who were\r\nsimply trying to remind the world that for 22 years Cyprus\r\nhas remained a divided country whose people are still\r\nprevented by the Turkish occupation forces from returning\r\nto their homes and lands and from moving freely in their\r\ncountry. Furthermore, it has by now become abundantly\r\nclear that the Turkish action was orchestrated well in\r\nadvance and involved the import from Turkey of 3,000\r\nterrorists belonging to the Gray Wolves organization with\r\nthe goal of provoking bloody confrontation between Greek\r\nand Turkish Cypriots. This sinister plan was aimed at\r\ndemonstrating that the two communities cannot live\r\npeacefully together in Cyprus and therefore separatist and\r\npartitionist solutions should be sought.\r\nWhile we mourn and condemn the brutal murder of\r\nthe two unarmed Greek Cypriot protesters, we also feel\r\nsorry for the subsequent killing of a Turkish soldier and the\r\nwounding of another. We regret the haste with which the\r\nTurkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktaş, attempted to attribute\r\nresponsibility for this killing to the Greek Cypriot side\r\nbefore an independent United Nations investigation\r\npublished its findings. The recent tragic events, however,\r\nwill not cause us to waver from our commitment to seek\r\na peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem through\r\nnegotiations, as provided by the United Nations\r\nresolutions. These events only highlight the need to\r\nexpedite and increase efforts to find a just, lasting and\r\nworkable solution to the Cyprus problem.\r\nWe are encouraged by the rekindled interest and\r\nmore active engagement of the international community\r\nin the Cyprus problem, as witnessed by the appointments\r\nof Special Representatives from interested countries,\r\nincluding the appointment of the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Han Sung-Joo. We welcome\r\nall initiatives set out to reinforce the United Nations in\r\nthe search for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus\r\nquestion.\r\nVarious United Nations resolutions, and the United\r\nNations Secretary-General himself, have declared the\r\npresent status quo in Cyprus unacceptable, a view shared\r\nby the international community. The time has come to\r\nmake a further determined and sustained effort to solve\r\nthe Cyprus problem. To that end, the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus will be working earnestly and\r\nimaginatively with the United Nations Special\r\nRepresentative and with all others supporting its efforts to\r\nprepare the ground for negotiations on the main\r\noutstanding issues.\r\nAny settlement of the Cyprus problem should be\r\nbased on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty, an\r\ninternational personality and a single citizenship. Its\r\nindependence and territorial integrity must be safeguarded,\r\nand it must be composed of two politically equal\r\ncommunities, as described in the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, in a bicommunal and bi-zonal\r\nfederation. Such settlement must exclude union, in whole\r\nor in part, with any other country or any form of partition\r\nor secession.\r\nThe security of both communities is a crucial issue,\r\nwhich would be helpful in finding a solution. It will be\r\nnecessary to devise effective guarantees; demilitarization\r\nand the stationing in Cyprus of an international force will\r\nalso be required. Demilitarization represents an important\r\ncontribution to this settlement.\r\nWe are prepared to embark on face-to-face\r\nnegotiations in 1997 once the ground has been sufficiently\r\nprepared to ensure success. We are not, however, willing,\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nafter 22 years of negotiations that have yielded no results\r\non the main issues of the problem, to embark on another\r\nround of fruitless talks. On the one hand, they destroy the\r\ncredibility of the negotiating process, and on the other, they\r\nkeep the attention of the international community focused\r\non the intercommunal constitutional aspect of the problem,\r\nthus overshadowing the real issue — the invasion and\r\ncontinued occupation, for 22 years, of substantial territory\r\nof the Republic of Cyprus by the Turkish forces.\r\nWe, for our part, will continue to do everything in our\r\npower to help the Secretary-General of our Organization to\r\nsucceed in his renewed efforts, through his newly appointed\r\nSpecial Representative, in the search for a lasting solution\r\nto the Cyprus problem.\r\nAt the same time the Government of the Republic of\r\nCyprus will pursue its application for membership in the\r\nEuropean Union, because such membership will have\r\nbenefits for both communities. While we hope to keep\r\naccession negotiations to the timetable already foreseen, we\r\nearnestly desire to reach a solution to our problem before\r\naccession.\r\nAt the beginning of my statement, I spoke of the need\r\nto reform and strengthen our Organization. From this\r\nrostrum, I have repeatedly underlined the importance of\r\nhonouring the commitments we enter into and of\r\nimplementing the decisions we take. I have stressed how\r\nessential it is to uphold the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter and to hold to full account those who violate them.\r\nThe question of Cyprus continues to be such a case of\r\naccountability, due to the refusal of Turkey to implement\r\nsolemn Security Council and General Assembly resolutions\r\ncalling for, among other things, the respect of the\r\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of\r\nthe Republic of Cyprus, the withdrawal of all foreign\r\ntroops, the return of the refugees to their homes and lands,\r\nthe respect of the demographic composition of the Republic\r\nand the restoration of the basic human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus. In fact, not\r\nonly has Turkey not implemented these resolutions, but it\r\nhas grossly violated them. Even the immense humanitarian\r\nproblem of the missing persons remains unresolved,\r\nperpetuating the tragedy of their relatives. All efforts should\r\ntherefore be exerted by the Security Council, and by all\r\nthose in a position to do so, to bring about a real change in\r\nTurkey’s attitude.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has\r\nhighlighted the need to maintain and reinforce our faith and\r\nthat of future generations in our Organization.\r\nImplementation of United Nations decisions will go a\r\nlong way towards achieving this lofty goal.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank His Excellency the President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Italy, His Excellency Mr. Lamberto\r\nDini.\r\nMr. Dini (Italy): On behalf of Italy, I am pleased to\r\nexpress to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of this session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your extensive and widely recognized\r\nknowledge and experience of the activities and functions\r\nof the United Nations is the best guarantee of your\r\nsuccess. At the same time, allow me to sincerely thank\r\nyour predecessor, Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal, who so ably led the historic fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nIn addition, I should like to express our great\r\nappreciation for the inspiring role and constructive\r\nleadership of the United Nations provided by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nItaly shares and fully supports the statement made\r\nbefore the General Assembly on Tuesday by the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Foreign Minister of Ireland on behalf\r\nof the European Union. At the special commemorative\r\nmeeting for the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nthere was a solemn reaffirmation of the need for the\r\nUnited Nations to implement significant changes to keep\r\nstep with the new global realities. Italy believes that the\r\ntime has come to translate ideas into urgently needed\r\nreforms. Let me briefly address them.\r\nThe General Assembly is the most representative\r\nexpression of the values of our Organization. Therefore,\r\nwe believe that the General Assembly must increasingly\r\nreflect the opinions of our peoples and become more\r\ndemocratic through direct links to the institutional realities\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nof its Member States. The Italian delegation to the General\r\nAssembly, for example, includes representatives of both the\r\nSenate and the Chamber of Deputies of our Parliament,\r\nwhich helps our political forces to have a fuller appreciation\r\nfor the role and activities of the United Nations. We hope\r\nthat this practice, which is also followed by certain other\r\ncountries, becomes more widespread and consolidated.\r\nThe General Assembly’s subsidiary bodies should be\r\nsimplified, merging some committees while streamlining the\r\nagenda. Greater transparency is needed in relations between\r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that the Secretariat\r\nshould be restructured, so as to organize resources and\r\nfunctions around two focal points: on the one hand, peace\r\nand security; and on the other, democracy and development.\r\nIn this context, Italy proposes that the three economic and\r\nsocial departments of the United Nations Secretariat should\r\nbe merged into a single entity under the leadership of a\r\nDeputy Secretary-General, who would also act as the\r\nExecutive Secretary of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nItaly is actively committed to Security Council reform\r\nand has presented a detailed proposal inspired by the\r\nfundamental principles of democracy, equitable\r\ngeographical representation, efficiency and transparency.\r\nReform should not lead to the establishment of new\r\nregimes of privilege, which would diminish rather than\r\nincrease equitable representation on the Council. Last April,\r\nin his address before the General Assembly, the President\r\nof the Republic of Italy, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, warned that\r\nstressing the elitist nature of the Council\r\n“could widen the gap and thus reduce the interest of\r\nthe excluded, demeaning their political commitment in\r\nthe process and perhaps marginalizing them and\r\ngiving them the dangerous feeling that they are token\r\npresences, mere spectators.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n103rd meeting, p. 3-4)\r\nOur goal instead must be to stimulate a greater involvement\r\nof all countries, large and small, through a rotation\r\nmechanism.\r\nThe Italian proposal would maintain a central role for\r\nthe General Assembly. In fact, it would be up to the\r\nGeneral Assembly to decide, on the basis of objective\r\ncriteria, which countries could rotate more frequently. It\r\nwould be up to the General Assembly to elect these\r\ncountries, by a two-thirds majority and by secret ballot, in\r\na truly democratic way. And it would be up to the\r\nGeneral Assembly periodically to review the countries in\r\nquestion.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council has found it difficult\r\nto reach a consensus. Italy considers its proposal a\r\nbalanced way of reconciling the new international\r\nrealities, namely the emergence of countries with notable\r\npolitical and economic capacities — and I include Italy\r\namong them — and the rise in developing countries, a\r\nfull 132 of which are Member States of the United\r\nNations today. However, we are willing to discuss and\r\nadhere to a formula that is not inconsistent with the\r\nfundamental principles that govern our own proposal.\r\nA new generation of peace-keeping has begun. From\r\nits original role as a force of interposition, peace-keeping\r\nhas gradually taken on the broader tasks of pacification,\r\nsupport for the process of national reconciliation, and\r\ntoday the protection of populations threatened by inter-\r\nethnic conflicts. Italy believes that in confronting these\r\ntasks every Member State should responsibly consider\r\nmaking, and be prepared to make, larger and more\r\nqualified military contingents available to the United\r\nNations. Italy is capable of doing its part, as demonstrated\r\nin Mozambique and in Bosnia.\r\nTo make United Nations actions more effective in\r\nthis field, Italy proposes the following 10 concrete\r\nmeasures which would be designed to: involve troop-\r\ncontributing countries in the decision-making process;\r\nconduct annual reviews of the mission, mandate, and\r\nmeans of peace-keeping operations; have readily\r\ndeployable military forces available as soon as Security\r\nCouncil decisions are made; create a reliable and unified\r\ncommand structure for peace-keeping operations; expand\r\nlogistical support for peace-keeping operations; prioritize\r\ntraining programmes for peace-keeping personnel;\r\nimprove the financing of peace-keeping operations; fill\r\nthe gap between peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding; entrust certain peace-keeping operations to\r\nregional organizations; and, finally, enhance cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU).\r\nTo go into these points more at length, first of all\r\nwe are glad that the Security Council, as suggested by\r\nItaly and other countries, has made it a regular practice to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nhold consultations with troop-contributing countries before\r\nadopting decisions on peace-keeping operations. The next\r\nstep is a formal mechanism that guarantees the participation\r\nof troop-contributing countries in the decision-making\r\nprocess. In this connection, Italy will lend its full support\r\nto the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister of\r\nNorway, Mrs. Brundtland, for an annual seminar to focus\r\non the three M’s of peace-keeping: Mission, Mandate and\r\nMeans.\r\nThe United Nations must be ready to deal with\r\nconflicts where and when they break out, and to this end,\r\nit must be able to count on readily available military forces,\r\nas provided for by Article 43 of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. We would also support the establishment, as\r\nsuggested by Canada, of a headquarters module for peace-\r\nkeeping at the United Nations Secretariat, whose\r\ncomposition should respect the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical representation.\r\nItaly intends to promote specific proposals to expand\r\nlogistical support, on the strength of its experience with the\r\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the\r\nImplementation Force (IFOR). Already, we have made\r\navailable the first United Nations logistic base in Brindisi,\r\nwhich should be further expanded to ensure efficient\r\nresource management for peace-keeping operations and we\r\nsuggest a separate allocation in peace-keeping budgets for\r\nthe creation of logistic bases.\r\nThe training of peace-keeping personnel is the duty of\r\nthe United Nations Staff College in Turin, which was\r\ncreated on the Secretary-General’s initiative. The College\r\nis receiving the maximum support of the Italian\r\nGovernment and will hopefully receive the support of other\r\nMember States as well. Financing of peace-keeping\r\noperations could be improved through a peace-keeping\r\nsurcharge for new, frequently rotating Security Council\r\nmembers, as Italy has proposed. This would distribute the\r\nburden of the surcharge to a larger number of countries.\r\nAnother essential component of peace-keeping is\r\nhumanitarian assistance during and immediately after a\r\nconflict. Between the management of a conflict and post-\r\nconflict peace-building there is a gap. To fill just such a\r\ngap in Central America, Italy designed and funded the\r\nDevelopment Progress for Displaced Persons, Refugees and\r\nReturnees (PRODERE) programme, which contributed\r\nsubstantially to the process of reconciliation. A model effort\r\nof the same type is now under way in Mozambique.\r\nCloser coordination with regional organizations could\r\nhelp provide the United Nations with the human and\r\nmaterial resources it needs. Without detracting from the\r\nUnited Nations central role, certain peace-keeping and\r\npeace-enforcement operations should be entrusted to\r\nregional organizations or coalitions. A good example of\r\nthis is the success of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) in fulfilling the mandate it was\r\ngiven by the United Nations in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nwhere the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope has also played an increasing and important role.\r\nItaly hopes for growing dialogue between the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations,\r\nand a strengthening of the peace-keeping capabilities of\r\nAfrican countries. The OAU must be concretely helped to\r\nenhance its mechanism for conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement. In line with Italy’s traditional support for\r\ndemocratic development, we are planning a broad series\r\nof initiatives in Africa aimed at supporting parliamentary\r\nactivities and strengthening judicial structures and\r\ntraining.\r\nThe United Nations is a global system, and it\r\npursues global objectives. Conflict prevention and the\r\npromotion of peaceful solutions to controversies cannot be\r\npursued solely at the political and military level. The\r\nconditions for peace are found, perhaps primarily, in the\r\neconomic, social and cultural development of peoples.\r\nPoverty, underdevelopment, and cultural isolation disrupt\r\nrelations between countries and thus constitute threats to\r\ninternational peace.\r\nThrough its funds, programmes, and specialized\r\nagencies, the United Nations plays a vital role in\r\npreventing these obstacles from jeopardizing peaceful\r\ncoexistence. It helps restore the conditions for orderly\r\nglobal development after disruptions caused by internal\r\nand international conflicts. Italy appreciates the\r\nimportance of both prevention and post-conflict\r\nreconstruction, and is determined to strengthen its\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations specialized\r\nagencies.\r\nWith this in mind Italy has chosen the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) as one of the main points of reference for the\r\nreconstruction of the city of Mostar. Collaboration with\r\nthe cultural agency of the United Nations will also prove\r\nvaluable in other areas of the former Yugoslavia on\r\nprojects to reconstruct prestigious landmarks such as the\r\nSarajevo library and historic buildings in Ragusa/\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nDubrovnik.\r\nThe reform process also concerns the economic and\r\nsocial fields of the United Nations. The adoption of\r\nresolution 50/227 is a significant step forward, especially\r\nwhere it refers to strengthening the role of the Economic\r\nand Social Council. Special attention should be paid to the\r\noperative follow-up to this resolution.\r\nThe identification of priorities by the United Nations,\r\nin accordance with changes in international reality, is\r\nessential to achieving greater efficiency to serve the best\r\ninterests of the beneficiary countries, as well as those of the\r\nUnited Nations itself.\r\nDuring the last five years the United Nations has\r\nsponsored a series of global conferences to address\r\nsystematically the key issues facing humanity today. The\r\nupcoming World Food Summit, which will take place in\r\nRome from November 13-17 of this year, will close this\r\nimportant cycle. This summit will provide an opportunity\r\nto define new strategic objectives for international action in\r\nthe field of food security in order to overcome structural\r\nshortages, especially in the nutrition sector, in many regions\r\nof our planet. In preparation, Italy is promoting a joint\r\ndevelopment initiative for Angola with the three agricultural\r\nagencies whose headquarters are in Rome.\r\nThe process of economic globalization and the\r\ngrowing interdependence of markets offer enormous\r\neconomic and social growth possibilities. From this\r\nperspective, the concept of global partnership provides for\r\nan equitable sharing of responsibilities. The Ministerial\r\nMeeting in Singapore is an excellent opportunity to focus\r\non these issues, consolidating the process of trade\r\nliberalization sanctioned by the Uruguay Round and\r\nstrengthening the regulatory role of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO).\r\nItaly is actively participating in the preparation of the\r\n1997 special session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly dedicated to the environment. While keeping in\r\nmind the results of the Rio Conference and foreseeable\r\nfuture scenarios for sustainable development, that session\r\nshould update the instruments for action and continue to\r\nstrive for implementation of Agenda 21. In 1996 significant\r\nachievements have been made in the field of disarmament.\r\nA major step on the road to nuclear disarmament has of\r\ncourse been taken with the signing of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In the field of conventional\r\nweapons, an important agreement was reached in Florence\r\nlast June on arms control in the former Yugoslavia. Our\r\nnext goal should be a cut-off in the production of fissile\r\nmaterial for military purposes.\r\nThe Italian Government pledges to renounce once\r\nand for all the production and export of anti-personnel\r\nland-mines. We will also initiate the destruction of\r\nexisting devices and promote further restrictions in the\r\nhope that such measures will contribute to reaching a\r\nsolid international understanding and a definitive ban. To\r\nthis end, we propose the prompt opening of international\r\nnegotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in\r\nGeneva.\r\nThe fundamental role of law in the creation of a new\r\nworld order must be upheld. National sovereignty has\r\nnothing to fear from the consolidation of international\r\nlaw. We believe that the cause of peace can only profit\r\nfrom the establishment of an international criminal court\r\non violations of international humanitarian law and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. Italy is committed to this goal and is\r\nready to host a diplomatic conference in 1998 to sanction\r\nthe birth of such a court. Italy is also promoting a\r\ncampaign for a worldwide moratorium on the application\r\nof the death penalty.\r\nThe European Union has constantly emphasized that\r\nfinancial reform is essential to any modernizing of the\r\nUnited Nations structure, and we share the ideas\r\nexpressed on this subject by the Irish presidency. We are\r\nconvinced that financial reform is a prerequisite to the\r\nUnited Nations maintaining its crucial function in\r\ninternational relations. The role that United Nations\r\nMember States intend to play in pursuing the objectives\r\nof the Charter cannot be independent of their specific\r\nresponsibility to honour their financial obligations. We\r\nfirmly reiterate the validity of the specific proposal for\r\nfinancial reform presented by the European Union under\r\nItaly’s presidency during the first half of this year.\r\nA formidable task awaits us: to adapt our\r\nOrganization to the needs and the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century. Italy is prepared to spare no effort in\r\nthe pursuit of our common goals.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Royal Highness\r\nPrince Mohamed Bolkiah, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBrunei Darussalam.\r\nPrince Mohamed Bolkiah (Brunei Darussalam): It\r\nis a very special pleasure for Brunei Darussalam to greet\r\nyou, Mr. President, as a close friend and neighbour.\r\nPlease accept our warmest congratulations, both to you\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nand to all Malaysians, on your election. May I also express\r\nour appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral\r\nfor his leadership during our fiftieth session.\r\nOur fiftieth anniversary has come and gone. We still\r\nremember the many fine statements made last year. Now,\r\nhowever, we have to give them practical substance. In this\r\nregard, Mr. President, I was very interested in your recent\r\nstatements on the role of the General Assembly. I was\r\nparticularly pleased that you emphasized practical economic\r\nand social development.\r\nIt was also most encouraging to hear you say that you\r\nintend to do all you can for the cause of United Nations\r\nreform. Like you, I feel that the General Assembly must\r\nnot be paralysed by the analysis of reform. We need\r\nconcrete proposals from our working groups. Then we can\r\nspend our time on the hard work of building consensus.\r\nThe need is urgent. Tension and conflict within\r\nnations are growing. At the same time, the United Nations\r\nis increasingly being asked to solve problems in many new\r\nareas of international concern — social, economic and\r\nsometimes even criminal — that transcend national borders.\r\nIt is also expected to address the deep-seated causes of\r\nfuture instability, the widening gap between North and\r\nSouth and the allied problems of overpopulation and\r\nurbanization, which have been so sharply exposed by this\r\nOrganization at recent conferences. Above all, it has to face\r\nthe results of these problems in the form of mounting\r\nintolerance, violent aggression and, all too often, extremism\r\nand terrorism.\r\nIn trying to do all this, its resources are overstretched.\r\nFor this reason, I would like to thank the Secretary-General,\r\nhis representatives and all those who are serving this\r\nOrganization in the field, often in extremely difficult\r\nconditions. Their work represents a deep commitment to the\r\ncause of peace and stability in the world and I admire and\r\ngreatly appreciate it. However, I also tend to think that\r\nmaybe we are asking them to take on new tasks with old or\r\noutdated tools. If they are not provided with the means to\r\nmanage our affairs well, then we in the United Nations are\r\nat fault.\r\nIn this respect, the tragedy of Bosnia is a warning to\r\nus. Certainly, we in Brunei Darussalam welcome recent\r\ndevelopments and will continue to give our strong support\r\nto the new Government in Bosnia. At the same time, I feel\r\nthat all of us in this Assembly should recognize the extent\r\nto which the events of the last five years reveal our own\r\nshortcomings.\r\nWe hope that the Security Council will now begin to\r\ninsist that all agreements be resolutely kept. We would\r\nlike to see it acting firmly against political pressure from\r\nany quarter and ensuring that nothing is allowed to stand\r\nin the way of the peoples’ recovery.\r\nI say this with particular concern as we are now\r\nfacing what could become another emblem of failure for\r\nus: the current situation in the Middle East. Until quite\r\nrecently, this was a problem which had defied solution\r\nsince the earliest days of this Organization. Then, at last,\r\na peace agreement was reached which gave us a realistic\r\nglimpse of hope. Even though we realized that it would\r\nbe a very difficult process, we felt optimistic. However,\r\na new Government in Israel now appears to be\r\nchallenging the very basis on which our own hopes for\r\npeace were founded. The solutions that appeared to be\r\nwithin the grasp of the parties directly concerned are\r\nunder threat. Rather than becoming more manageable, the\r\nscope of the so-called Middle East problem has now\r\nextended to include the people of Iraq.\r\nIt is consequently with great concern that Brunei\r\nDarussalam adds its voice to the many who wish to\r\nimpress on the leaders of Israel the need to continue the\r\npeace process, not just by making statements, but in the\r\nfull spirit of the agreements reached in Madrid and Oslo.\r\nWhat I have briefly described represents the sum of\r\neconomic, social and political problems, which in our\r\nview calls for a new approach on our part. This can only\r\nbe developed, we feel, when the United Nations is\r\nreformed. I say this because we are seeing the emergence\r\nof a new type of international community, far more\r\ndiverse than the one our founders knew. At the same\r\ntime, it is one which is being drawn even closer together\r\nthrough the advance of technology and\r\ncommunications — the “global village” of popular\r\ndescription.\r\nThere are many reasons to welcome this. It could\r\nmean that we all learn to acknowledge and appreciate our\r\ndiversity and to take on the best aspects of a real village.\r\nHowever, there is no guarantee. Villages are not always\r\npleasant places to live in. They have their darker side.\r\nModern technology may well encourage neighbourly\r\ncooperation, but it is just as capable of enhancing the\r\nhostile elements of primitive village life. It could set up\r\na permanent division between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping worlds.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nThat is why I feel it is essential for us to find an\r\neffective new approach to the tremendous changes taking\r\nplace today. As members know, this is what we are trying\r\nto develop in South-East Asia. The way we have chosen\r\nhas enabled us to promote programmes aimed at preventive\r\ndiplomacy and economic cooperation in our region. It has\r\nalso meant that we have been able to offer some wider\r\nassistance to the cause of South-South cooperation.\r\nThese are specific measures with practical aims and\r\nthey are producing clear results, but they also have a\r\nbroader and deeper effect. They enable us not only to\r\nmanage the diversity of our region, but also, at a very\r\nhuman level, to learn to appreciate each others’ differences\r\nand enjoy the challenge of working together.\r\nBy way of example, I would like to commend our\r\nfriends and colleagues in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar for\r\ntheir intention to join the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN). They are making a lasting contribution\r\nto peace and stability in our region. We are therefore\r\ndelighted to be on the verge of seeing the whole of South-\r\nEast Asia working together in cooperation.\r\nWhat this has led to in terms of strengthening\r\ninternational peace and security is illustrated by our very\r\nextensive dialogue process. One practical result of this in\r\nour region was the signing of the South-East Asia Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty at the last ASEAN summit. This\r\nis a Treaty which we would like all nuclear-weapon States\r\nto join as a commitment to peace in our region. It was in\r\nthis spirit that we endorsed the resolution on the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, passed by this\r\nAssembly earlier this month, as a first step towards\r\nworldwide nuclear disarmament.\r\nWhat we are trying to stress is the need for inclusion,\r\ndrawing together all parties to a problem, working towards\r\nconsensus rather than demanding compromise and bringing\r\neveryone into the mainstream of decision-making. The kind\r\nof results we hope for were shown just this month in the\r\nachievements of the Government of the Philippines and the\r\nleaders of the Moro National Liberation Front through the\r\ngood offices of Indonesia. Their efforts brought to an end\r\nmore than 20 years of violence and hostility, and I would\r\nlike to congratulate all the parties involved.\r\nWe see this as reflecting the need that lies behind the\r\nstrong calls that many Member States have made for reform\r\nof this Organization. It acknowledges that aggression must\r\nbe dealt with firmly, but it also recognizes what has been\r\ntragically impressed upon us all over the past few years in\r\nEurope, Africa and Asia. It is what guides all our work in\r\nour region and, I suggest, must be the starting point for\r\nany new approach to the conduct of international affairs\r\ntoday. It is the knowledge that, if we do not accept and\r\nwillingly embrace diversity, there is a price to be paid\r\nand it is unacceptable.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadi Udovenko.\r\nMr. Udovenko (Ukraine): It is my honour to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the post of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession. On behalf of the Ukrainian delegation, I would\r\nalso like to express my appreciation to Mr. Freitas\r\ndo Amaral, who presided so efficiently over the last\r\nsession and encouraged an intensive exchange of opinions\r\non the role of the United Nations in today’s world.\r\nA year ago, at the commemorative session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, our Organization received a substantial\r\ncredit of trust as a universal international institution\r\nwhich, in the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations, was called upon to\r\n“create new opportunities for peace, development,\r\ndemocracy and cooperation.” (resolution 50/6, third\r\npreambular para.)\r\nToday, we can assert that the United Nations has\r\nbeen and remains the key mechanism for maintaining and\r\nstrengthening peace and security — and there is much\r\nproof of that. There is no doubt that the past year has\r\nbeen extremely important for arms control and\r\ndisarmament. Tomorrow, 27 September, I will have the\r\nhonour to sign, on behalf of Ukraine, the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), as adopted in historic\r\nresolution 50/245. This important instrument calls for the\r\nde jure affirmation of the end of the nuclear-arms-race\r\nera. In signing this Treaty, Ukraine will make yet another\r\ncontribution to disarmament, the importance of which\r\ncannot be overstated.\r\nIn this context, I recall another historic event: the\r\nfinal withdrawal of strategic nuclear warheads from the\r\nterritory of Ukraine. Having eliminated the world’s third-\r\nlargest nuclear arsenal, which we had inherited, Ukraine\r\nbecame a nuclear-weapon-free State on 1 June 1996. In\r\ndoing so, we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedented\r\ncontribution, which has not yet received adequate\r\nrecognition by the international community, to\r\ndiminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\ndemonstrated to the whole world its peaceful, consistent\r\nand reliable policy. Accordingly, we expect the nuclear\r\nStates strictly to adhere to their commitments relating to the\r\nsecurity assurances given to Ukraine by the United States\r\nof America, Russia, the United Kingdom, China and France\r\nin December 1994.\r\nMr. Michaelides (Greece), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nUkraine’s important role in the new European security\r\narchitecture has been recognized recently in several\r\ninternational documents. For us, this means a special\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of stability in the whole\r\nof Europe. We therefore believe that the process of nuclear\r\ndisarmament should become more dynamic. In this context,\r\nthe initiative put forward by the President of Ukraine,\r\nLeonid Kuchma, with regard to the creation of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in Central and Eastern Europe between\r\nthe Baltic and the Black Seas is the next logical step and an\r\nimportant move in the right direction. I would like to\r\nemphasize that the possible deployment of nuclear weapons\r\non the territories of our neighbours in Central and Eastern\r\nEurope is a matter of great concern to us. We believe that\r\nsupport for the idea of a non-nuclear Central Europe would\r\npromote an atmosphere of confidence between and among\r\nthe States of the region and prevent the emergence of new\r\ndividing lines on the European continent. By adding to the\r\nexisting zones in Antarctica, the South Pacific, Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, as well as the nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones in South-East Asia and Africa, the creation of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central and Eastern Europe\r\nwould create the “critical mass” that would foster the\r\nprocess of global nuclear disarmament.\r\nIn our opinion, the Conference on Disarmament, which\r\nincludes Ukraine as a new, full-fledged member, should\r\nimmediately start developing a programme of complete\r\nnuclear disarmament with a view to bringing closer the\r\nrealization of Ukraine’s appeal for a twenty-first century\r\nwithout nuclear weapons.\r\nAmong other important international achievements of\r\nthe past year, I would like to refer to the beginning of the\r\npeace settlement in the former Yugoslavia. It is important\r\nto remember that the peace-keeping efforts of the United\r\nNations were not in vain. Risking their lives in difficult\r\nconditions, the Blue Helmets have fulfilled their mission\r\nand prevented the spillover of the conflict. In this context,\r\nI would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the\r\nnecessity of the speedy entry into force and implementation\r\nof the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations\r\nand Associated Personnel.\r\nWe hope that the peace process initiated in Dayton\r\nhas become irreversible. The proof of this will be in the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the military aspects of the\r\nPeace Agreement by the Implementation Force (IFOR)\r\nand of the recent elections held in Bosnia under the\r\nauspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE).\r\nIn general, we think that recent international efforts\r\nin the former Yugoslavia have been a success not only for\r\na peace settlement. In my opinion, we have also\r\nwitnessed the appearance of a potential machinery for\r\neffective cooperation between various international\r\nstructures in crisis management. I refer in particular to an\r\nimportant experience of the Implementation Force (IFOR)\r\noperation carried out, under the mandate of the Security\r\nCouncil, by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), its partners — including Ukraine — and other\r\ncountries. At the same time, the ultimate success of the\r\npeace process will be impossible without the active and\r\naction-oriented involvement of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the\r\nimplementation of civil aspects of the Agreement. The\r\nconcerted efforts by the United Nations, NATO and the\r\nOSCE to settle one of the most tragic conflicts of our\r\ntime prove that political will and a clear division of\r\nfunctions between the respective structures make it\r\npossible to transform the idea of mutually reinforcing\r\ninstitutions into reality. In the meantime, the international\r\ncommunity may have acquired a reliable mechanism for\r\nthe solution of its acute problems.\r\nI believe that the experience of the peace settlement\r\nin the former Yugoslavia could serve as a shining\r\nexample for the common elaboration of a future global\r\nsecurity architecture by all Members of this world\r\nOrganization. This architecture should also contain a\r\ncomprehensive concept of peace-keeping, the elaboration\r\nof which, within the framework of the General Assembly,\r\nhas to be accelerated. An essential element in this work\r\ncould be the eventual reorientation of peace-keeping\r\ntowards preventive diplomacy.\r\nHowever, it is obvious that we will not be able to\r\nbuild up a new global security architecture without radical\r\nreform of the United Nations itself. The need for United\r\nNations reform was emphasized by virtually all\r\nparticipants at the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nThis issue is also a matter of discussion at the current\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nsession. Yet real changes can be achieved only on the\r\ncondition of a substantial revision of the existing financial\r\nsystem of the United Nations.\r\nln recent years the United Nations has been\r\nexperiencing an unprecedented financial crisis which poses\r\na real threat to its very functioning. Experience shows that\r\nfinancial crises are the result either of a wrong taxation\r\npolicy or of unsound spending. We think that in the case of\r\nthe United Nations both factors are involved. The inability\r\nof a number of Member States to meet their financial\r\nobligations is a direct consequence of the overassessment of\r\ntheir contribution rates. It will be impossible for the United\r\nNations to avert financial crisis unless existing irregularities\r\nin the scale of apportionment of its expenses are eliminated.\r\nAnd we expect that the current session will find a proper\r\nsolution to this problem.\r\nAgainst its will, Ukraine has been made one of the\r\nUnited Nations debtors. This has occurred due to the fact\r\nthat the decision on the relocation of my country to group\r\n(c) in the scale for the financing of peace-keeping\r\noperations has been delayed for several years. The\r\naccumulation of a substantial debt is a direct result of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s unfair decision 47/456, whose sponsors\r\nwere perfectly well aware that the decision would lead to\r\nthe current financial crisis. They refused to increase the\r\ncontribution of those nations which could afford to pay and,\r\ncontrary to the rules, placed larger assessments on the\r\nshoulders of the countries which were unable to pay such\r\namounts.\r\nUkraine has always been aware of the need to provide\r\nthe United Nations with adequate financial resources. Upon\r\nthe instructions of my Government, I would like to inform\r\nmembers that Ukraine will start paying off its debt to the\r\nUnited Nations. As early as this year, the amount will be\r\nreduced by $20 million. In coming years, its real payments\r\nto the Organization’s budget will be increased.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should become\r\nanother important component of transformation within the\r\nUnited Nations. We support the desire of Germany and\r\nJapan to acquire the status of permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, but at the same time stand for increasing\r\nthe number of non-permanent members on the basis of\r\nequitable geographical representation, which would also\r\ntake into account the interests of the Eastern European\r\nregional group. I hope that the “two plus eight” formula\r\nwhich was proposed by Ukraine and which, in principle,\r\ncoincides with the Italian approach and that of other\r\ncountries, will be conducive to the achievement of a\r\nmutually acceptable solution to the problem within the\r\nframework of the relevant Working Group of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOne of the essential features of general peace and\r\nsecurity in the next millennium should be qualitatively\r\nnew international economic cooperation, the globalization\r\nof production and trade, the development of science and\r\ntechnology and the broadening of the flows of finances\r\nand services.\r\nWe believe that the attention of the world\r\ncommunity should focus today on more than the political\r\nand military aspects of security. It must also encompass\r\nthe economic, social and ecological dimensions of peace\r\nand sustainable development. For Ukraine, this is not just\r\nan abstract idea without a fixed deadline for its\r\nimplementation. Chernobyl turned the ecological\r\ndimension of our national security into a priority of\r\nUkrainian domestic and foreign policy.\r\nTen years have passed since that catastrophe, but we\r\nare still experiencing its grave consequences. Chernobyl\r\nhas not disappeared into the past. If humankind continues\r\nto ignore common sense and to think only about today,\r\nChernobyl may be a reflection of our future.\r\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General’s report\r\non the work of the Organization (A/51/1) stating that the\r\nUnited Nations remains deeply concerned by the\r\nconsequences of Chernobyl and is committed to pursuing\r\nmeasures aimed at their alleviation. We hope that the\r\ninternational community will continue to create\r\nconditions, including material and financial ones, which\r\nwould allow Ukraine to meet its obligation and to\r\ndecommission the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the\r\nyear 2000.\r\nWe should also remember that durable peace and\r\nsustainable development on a global scale cannot be\r\nachieved unless all countries secure adequate living\r\nstandards for their populations and overcome\r\nunemployment, poverty, social disintegration and\r\nenvironmental pollution.\r\nIn this context, I would like to draw attention to the\r\ninitiative concerning the creation of the Council on\r\nEconomic Security put forward by the President of\r\nUkraine at the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year. In our view, it is high time\r\nto concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member\r\nStates on the formation of a legal basis which would\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nallow us to implement this important initiative as one of the\r\nsteps towards increasing the level of international economic\r\nsecurity, securing the global coordination of the activities\r\nof international, regional and national economic institutions\r\nand preventing economic coercion and discrimination.\r\nThe issues of international terrorism, organized crime,\r\nillicit trafficking of drugs and money laundering have\r\nbecome matters of special concern. Ukraine has always\r\nplayed an active role in international efforts, particularly\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, aimed at\r\neliminating these scourges of the present, which not only\r\nthreaten the security and the health of people but have a\r\nnegative impact on the social, economic and political\r\nsituation in many countries. We believe that special\r\nattention should be paid to the elaboration of specific\r\nactions to be taken against transnational organized crime. In\r\nthis context, Poland’s initiative to place on the agenda of\r\nthe current session the question of the possible elaboration\r\nof a convention on those issues is more than timely and\r\nshould be supported. Ukraine is ready to participate in the\r\ndrafting of this legal instrument.\r\nIn view of the present financial situation of the\r\nOrganization, the search for new ways to revitalize\r\ninternational cooperation in the field of development has\r\nacquired new significance. One of the promising trends,\r\nprimarily in finding additional sources of financing, is the\r\npromotion of regular dialogue between the United Nations\r\nand the financial institution of the Bretton Woods system.\r\nWe are convinced that larger resources allocated by\r\nthese institutions for development would speed up social\r\nand economic transformations both in economies in\r\ntransition and in developing countries. They would also\r\ncreate conditions for the successful reform of the global\r\nsystem of international economic relations. It is quite\r\nobvious that the integration of those countries into the\r\nworld economic system would benefit the entire global\r\ncommunity. We believe that this very philosophy should\r\nbecome a foundation for a new strategy of global economic\r\ndevelopment. The United Nations is called upon to play a\r\ndecisive role in its elaboration.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the gradual deepening of\r\nunderstanding among Member States of the problems faced\r\nby the countries with economies in transition, as is shown\r\nby the increased resources allocated by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme for its operational activities in the\r\ncountries of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. For its part,\r\nUkraine is considering becoming a full member of the\r\nmultilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World\r\nTrade Organization system as an integral part of its own\r\neconomic reform.\r\nThe successes of the United Nations depend upon\r\nthe stable development of each Member State. Steadily\r\novercoming the obstacles that befell our State in the\r\nprocess of radically transforming its society, Ukraine has\r\nrecently marked the fifth anniversary of its independence.\r\nFrom this rostrum I would like to reaffirm that the choice\r\nof the Ukrainian people in favour of independent\r\ndemocratic development is final and irreversible.\r\nThe adoption on 28 June of this year of the\r\nConstitution of Ukraine has become an event of historic\r\nimportance for the Ukrainian people. As President Leonid\r\nKuchma emphasized,\r\n“It is an event of a great significance belonging to\r\nthose few historical dates which unite people not by\r\nthe iron fist but by the imperatives of the heart, and\r\nwhich turn a population into a nation and a territory\r\ninto a State.”\r\nIn adopting its fundamental law, Ukraine has chosen\r\nits own model of State-building and for reformatting its\r\npublic life. In drafting the law, Ukrainian legislators\r\nbenefited not only from previous historical experiences —\r\nsuch as that provided by Pylyp Orlyk, a famous\r\nseventeenth-century Ukrainian public figure who wrote\r\none of the first European democratic constitutions — but\r\nalso drew upon the modern experience, in particular that\r\nof the members of the Council of Europe.\r\nWe in Ukraine are consistently building a sovereign,\r\nindependent, democratic and socially-oriented State which\r\npromotes human rights as the highest social value. Under\r\nextremely difficult circumstances, we have managed to\r\nfollow the European model of public life.\r\nI would like to emphasize that integration into\r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures is a strategic goal\r\nof Ukraine. At the same time my country is still\r\ncommitted to non-bloc status. Having yesterday become\r\nan observer in the Non-Aligned Movement, Ukraine once\r\nagain proved this.\r\nNo less important for us remain relations with the\r\nnewly independent States of the former Soviet Union,\r\nnotably with the Russian Federation, to which we are\r\nlinked by common historical experiences.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nTransformations initiated by the market reform of the\r\neconomy are becoming increasingly perceptible in Ukraine.\r\nThe recent introduction of a new currency, the hryvnya,\r\nproves conclusively that the radical economic changes in\r\nUkraine have become irreversible. The first results of\r\nmonetary reform show that in addition to a positive impact\r\non business activities, it has had a stabilizing psychological\r\neffect on the Ukrainian people.\r\nOur society is in the process of formation. We realize\r\nthat ours is a long and difficult path. There are a number of\r\nimportant objectives we have to achieve. This will require\r\nthe gradual revival of democratic standards and their\r\nintroduction into the fabric of Ukrainian society, which has\r\nbeen scarred by the totalitarian policies of the last decades.\r\nWhile advancing along this road, Ukraine will\r\ncontinue to count on the support of the international\r\ncommunity. At the same time, I would like to reaffirm that\r\nUkraine will continue to be committed to supporting the\r\nUnited Nations which, like my own country, is experiencing\r\na difficult but vital time of transformation. This is the\r\nimperative of our times, and we have to meet this\r\nchallenge.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Paraguay, His Excellency Mr. Rubén\r\nDarío Melgarejo Lanzoni.\r\nMr. Melgarejo Lanzoni (Paraguay) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): It is an honour for me, on behalf of\r\nParaguay, its people and its Government, to wish the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Ambassador Razali\r\nIsmail, every success in his endeavours. We wish also to\r\nemphasize the excellent work accomplished by President\r\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral, who tirelessly led the proceedings\r\nof the past session.\r\nFor Paraguay, the United Nations is a form that has\r\nguaranteed the free debate of ideas and the participation of\r\nall without discrimination or exclusion. For a long time, the\r\nUnited Nations has been the mandatory beacon of our\r\nnations when their essential rights were threatened. For\r\nParaguayans, the fundamental rights of men and women,\r\none of the pillars of the United Nations, are today vital —\r\nand not just rhetoric — in the search for world peace,\r\nfreedom and security, which only democratic civilian\r\nGovernments can guarantee.\r\nThe new historical reality we face — knowing\r\nimmediately what happens elsewhere in the world and\r\nwithin or countries — means that we all must share a\r\ngreater responsibility and solidarity. The globalization of\r\ntoday’s world is such that a problem besetting one nation\r\nis not an isolated matter, but rather one that must be\r\nconsidered by all.\r\nThis is why we will have to rethink the age-old\r\nquestion of what path all men and women should take.\r\nWhile we belong to diverse ideologies and cultures, we\r\nmust nevertheless secure equality, rights and freedoms.\r\nOur contributions and suggestions for strengthening\r\nthe Organization and adapting it to the new realities of\r\ntoday’s world therefore are made in the spirit of\r\ncooperation. This is why we request that the reforms to\r\nbe adopted in the framework of the United Nations be\r\naimed at reducing its fragmentation in order to make it a\r\nmore functionally integrated structure. Such reform will\r\nmake possible more fluid communication and much more\r\nefficient coordination. This is why we insist on reform to\r\neliminate unnecessary costs through the consolidation of\r\nthe programmes aimed at the harmonious development of\r\nour peoples, and to rationalize and optimize existing\r\nresources in order to avoid the duplication of human or\r\neconomic efforts.\r\nThe Government of Paraguay, aware of its\r\ninternational commitments, has made enormous efforts to\r\nfulfil its financial obligations to the United Nations. In\r\nthis regard, we send out an appeal for payments of\r\nassessed contributions to be made within established\r\ndeadlines in order to ensure the operation of the\r\nOrganization. The principle of equity so requires this.\r\nWe must also state that Paraguay’s position on the\r\nreform of the United Nations is clear with respect to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We consider this body not only a\r\nmodel of democratic decision-making, but also — given\r\nits high degree of universality and free exchange of\r\nideas — the most important organ of the system. We\r\nsupport the expansion of the Security Council, which\r\nrequires a larger number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers on the basis of equitable geographic distribution.\r\nIn this connection, we support the view that Latin\r\nAmerica should be represented among the permanent\r\nmembers, in addition to countries such as Germany and\r\nJapan. Paraguay maintains that the exercise of the veto\r\nshould evolve towards innovative mechanisms that would\r\nbe used more objectively.\r\nProgrammes that make sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment possible constitute another aspect the system\r\nmust take into account. Our country is promoting a social\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nmarket economy, free and respectful of private initiative,\r\nbut without disregarding the share of responsibility borne\r\nby the Government. We therefore view with satisfaction the\r\nleading role of the United Nations in the field of sustainable\r\nhuman development. In this connection, we wish to\r\nunderscore the binding conventions on the environment, the\r\ncommitment made by 118 Heads of State and Government\r\nto put an end to poverty, unemployment and social\r\nmarginalization, the important results achieved at Habitat II\r\nand the Midrand Declaration of the ninth session of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\r\nWe particularly endorse paragraph 17 of that\r\nDeclaration, which states that\r\n“The lack of territorial access to the sea,\r\naggravated by remoteness and isolation from world\r\nmarkets, imposes serious constraints on the overall\r\nsocio-economic development efforts of the land-locked\r\ndeveloping countries.” (TD/377, para. 17)\r\nAs such, those countries require sufficient international\r\ncooperation to maintain and improve their transportation\r\nand commercial-exchange infrastructure.\r\nHaving signed the aforementioned conventions and\r\nhaving participated in the aforementioned conference, the\r\nParaguayan national Government adopted concrete measures\r\nto implement the provisions of the plans of action that\r\nemerged from those meetings. Thus, following the mandate\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development, a secretariat\r\nfor social action was established at the ministerial level,\r\nreporting to the presidency of the Republic. Its fundamental\r\npurpose will be to prepare public policy on social projects\r\nand to coordinate the actions of the Government and civil\r\nsociety in order to improve our people\u0027s standard of living.\r\nWe have also prepared a strategic plan to improve\r\neducation, in conjunction with the educational reform\r\ncurrently being implemented by the national Government.\r\nWe have also devised a map of basic needs — which is\r\nalso known as poverty mapping. We have carried out a\r\nhousehold survey covering not only urban, but also rural\r\nareas. We are at the moment preparing a system of social\r\nindicators and social expenditures.\r\nFurthermore, a year after the holding of the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, the public and private\r\nsectors at large have been made keenly aware of its\r\nPlatform for Action, thus fortifying policies relating to\r\ngender.\r\nI wish to express my Government\u0027s deep gratitude to\r\nthe United Nations system, and particularly to its\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has\r\nconstantly and tirelessly helped us work towards the well-\r\nbeing of the people of Paraguay.\r\nWe are aware that our age is marked by unusual\r\ncharacteristics. Contemporary history defines us\r\ndifferently. Concepts have changed. Today we speak more\r\npositively and effectively about integration, cooperation\r\nand complementarity. The time of sterile confrontation is\r\nbehind us. This is a time of solidarity and of reciprocal\r\nand diverse cooperation; constructive and creative\r\ninterdependence is the key to our daily coexistence.\r\nToday\u0027s world needs not only a new economic order,\r\nbut also a new international cultural order. Science,\r\nknowledge and technology must be our universal heritage.\r\nAn awareness of solidarity is the way for which human\r\nbeings to understand themselves and others. We should\r\nsee that without this understanding of others we are\r\ninsufficient, incomplete and lacking in humanity. Genuine\r\ncomprehensive development requires the cooperation of\r\nall the men and women who inhabit this world. Only in\r\nthat way will development as a human right, with the\r\nblessing of the Organization and with our strong support,\r\nfind its full meaning and its place in history. Either we\r\nremedy our circumstances or we sink in them.\r\nHowever, the disappearance of the rivalries of a\r\nbipolar world has, unfortunately, not meant the end of\r\nconflict. Throughout this year, we have seen ethnic and\r\nnationalistic confrontations that have given rise to\r\noverwhelming human crises that have cut down innocent\r\nlives, destroyed property and — still more seriously —\r\nbrought about the loss of the value of coexistence. In this\r\nstate of affairs, Paraguay hopes that the military\r\nconfrontations that spill the blood of nations and violate\r\nthe right to live will very soon come to an end. We\r\nencourage the consolidation of the peace process in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and the resumption of the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East in order to find a just and\r\nlasting solution in that region.\r\nOur country also hopes that efforts will continue\r\ntowards the resolution of conflicts in Rwanda and\r\nBurundi in order to bring about peace and stability in the\r\nGreat Lakes region. Paraguay views with satisfaction the\r\nachievements made in Angola, and we hope that the\r\nOrganization of African Unity will continue to play an\r\nimportant role in the prevention and settlement of\r\nconflicts in Africa.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nParaguay notes with great satisfaction the results\r\nachieved by the United Nations through its peace-keeping\r\nMissions in Haiti, its observers in Nicaragua and\r\nEl Salvador and its verification Mission in Guatemala,\r\nwhich has achieved major success recently. Paraguay is in\r\nfavour of continuing increasingly to promote the\r\nmechanisms of preventive diplomacy and, above all, of\r\npeace-keeping. Similarly, the Republic of Paraguay\r\nwelcomes the spirit of reconciliation manifested by the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of China. We hope that a\r\ndialogue will be established to resolve the situation with the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China.\r\nNow more than ever before, stability and peace are the\r\nchallenge. It is imperative to build a multipolar world to\r\nguarantee the equitable development of nations and peoples.\r\nEquity should be the cornerstone of universal harmony. In\r\nthis spirit, we trust that our Organization’s actions for\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons will\r\nprove effective and will strengthen our battle against all\r\nthreats to peace and world security. Faithful to this purpose,\r\nParaguay co-sponsored the resolution on the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which was adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly last 10 September. We encourage all\r\nMember States of this great Organization to sign the Treaty,\r\nas I did a few days ago as Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nParaguay. We urge that the Treaty be promptly ratified so\r\nthat it may enter into force.\r\nAlmost 50 years ago, on 10 December 1948, the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted and proclaimed the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Thus did mankind achieve\r\none of its most precious goals: a Declaration of rights for\r\nwhich peoples and nations, individuals and societies, had\r\nalways fought. In Paraguay today, we firmly believe that\r\nwe have learned the hard lesson of living in peace,\r\ndemocracy and pluralism. The era of oppression and of a\r\nlack of basic freedoms, economic backwardness and\r\ncultural isolation is past. It is part of a sad history that we\r\nwill remember only so as not to repeat it. The democracy\r\nwe are building today, with the active participation of our\r\ncitizens and the solidarity of the international community,\r\nis part of an irreversible process.\r\nOf course, barely four months ago, a small group,\r\nnostalgic for authoritarianism, tried to turn back the clock.\r\nBut thanks to the prompt support of friendly nations and to\r\nthe spontaneous and courageous action of young people\r\nwho took to the streets to defend the democratic process,\r\nwe were able to abort a military adventure that could have\r\ncaused irreparable damage to our country. Fortunately, our\r\ncountry is today moving straight towards a strengthening of\r\nall its freedoms and towards democratic stability in its\r\npolitical system.\r\nWe are greatly pleased that Paraguay was able to\r\novercome its institutional crisis with the weapons of\r\ndemocracy. The threat of force against our institutions\r\nwas combated with our democratic beliefs. The\r\nGovernment averted the danger without resorting to any\r\nmeasures in violation of the Constitution or our laws.\r\nEven at the most difficult times, we maintained freedom\r\nof the press. No citizen was imprisoned and no\r\nemergency laws were decreed. Our victory was based on\r\nour belief in political pluralism and the right of dissent.\r\nThus, the calm and decisive action of the President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, restored the\r\nautonomy of civilian rule. We stopped being a democracy\r\nunder the protection of military power and became a\r\ncivilian democracy, free from interference or pressure\r\nfrom outside forces.\r\nHaving made this historic, political step, the\r\nGovernment and the people of Paraguay are deeply\r\ngrateful to the Member States of this Organization for\r\ntheir support during that delicate crisis. In particular, we\r\nare grateful to the Security Council for its clear and\r\nunflinching support of Paraguayan democracy. This\r\nsupport further strengthened our faith in the United\r\nNations efforts to maintain democratic political\r\ninstitutions, freedom, peace and international security.\r\nParaguay\u0027s foreign policy is based primarily on\r\nregional economic integration, at the centre of which is\r\nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). We\r\nare convinced that the Latin American integration process\r\nis the key to our country’s integration into the world\r\neconomy and to the consolidation of our democracy.\r\nFollowing this policy, we have undertaken many activities\r\nwith a view to expanding the links between our internal\r\nmarket and international economic processes.\r\nAnother important element has been the frontal\r\nattack on international organized crime. The task is not\r\neasy. For years political and economic corruption were\r\nthe modus operandi of the dictatorship. None the less, the\r\nGovernment of Paraguay is committed to fighting the\r\nscourge of drug trafficking and money-laundering. We\r\nencourage the public, national and foreign alike, to report\r\nirregularities worthy of investigation, inspection or review\r\nso as to eliminate the sources of corruption. With its new\r\nattitude of political transparency, the Government has sent\r\na draft bill to the National Congress which defines and\r\naims to suppress the crime of money-laundering,\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nincluding the laundering of profits from the illicit sale of\r\nnarcotics, psychotropic substances and dangerous drugs. A\r\nnational drug-control plan is also being drawn up.\r\nFifty years after the establishment of the International\r\nCourt of Justice in The Hague, my country — fulfilling the\r\npromise President Wasmosy made last year to the General\r\nAssembly — yesterday deposited with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations the instruments of acceptance\r\nof the jurisdiction of the Court. This decision is one further\r\ncommitment on my country’s part to the universal society\r\nin which we believe. As Minister for Foreign Affairs of my\r\nnation, I will always remember having been the vessel of\r\nthis historic decision. We also reiterate, as a land-locked\r\ncountry, the importance of the Convention and the reforms\r\nto the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We express our\r\nfaith in the principle of the universal heritage of mankind\r\nthrough our presence as a member of the council of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority.\r\nHere at the beginning of the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, as Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs I would like to take the liberty of making\r\na declaration of faith. Too young to have known the\r\nfounding, the first achievements, the main crises, the\r\nchanges and the development of the institutions of the\r\nUnited Nations, I belong to a generation destined to play a\r\nrole in the twenty-first century.\r\nWhen I was born, the human rights covenants had\r\nalready been written, the environment was already a\r\nconcern for all peoples, and the universal diplomatic\r\nconventions and legal system of treaties were already in\r\nplace. Such is our world at the end of the century. Thus, in\r\nsupporting reform, Paraguay believes that it is necessary to\r\nmention through me that there is one thing that we will not\r\nbe able to change: our purposes and goals, which we must\r\npreserve for future generations.\r\nWe will reaffirm time and time again the equality of\r\nnations, large and small, and the importance of creating\r\nconditions for the rule of international law. Here in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the soul of the United Nations,\r\nrepresenting a young nation which has yet enjoyed 200\r\nyears of independence and speaking before age-old peoples\r\nand cultures, I reaffirm mankind’s utopia: a common belief\r\nrenewed that we can affirm this forever to be our home.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Zimbabwe, His Excellency\r\nMr. Stanislaus Mudenge.\r\nMr. Mudenge (Zimbabwe): I congratulate\r\nMr. Razali on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We are more\r\nthan convinced that his vast experience and diplomatic\r\nskills will prove to be vital assets at this session of the\r\nAssembly. I assure him that my delegation will cooperate\r\nfully with him in the fulfilment of his onerous\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to pay tribute to his\r\npredecessor, Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who\r\nsteered the work of the Assembly through its historic\r\nfiftieth anniversary in a commendable and honourable\r\nway.\r\nOur tribute also goes to the Secretary-General\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali for his distinguished leadership of\r\nour Organization during the past year. We are especially\r\ngrateful to him for his tireless efforts to enhance the\r\nOrganization’s role in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity as well as in promoting international economic\r\ndevelopment and cooperation.\r\nAt the last session of the General Assembly, when\r\nwe celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, we witnessed the largest-ever gathering of Heads\r\nof State and Government. On that occasion, the world\r\nleaders made a historic reaffirmation of our commitment\r\nto the purposes and principles of this Organization as\r\nenshrined in the Charter. Besides taking stock of the\r\nprogress made and the lessons learnt during the past 50\r\nyears, the world leaders endeavoured not only to\r\nrecapture the vision of the founding fathers of the United\r\nNations, but also to chart the institutional framework and\r\noperational parameters that could enhance the\r\nOrganization’s relevance and effectiveness in a changed\r\ninternational landscape. My delegation sincerely hopes\r\nthat we will all be able to take full advantage of this\r\nrenewed commitment to the Organization to ensure that\r\nthe United Nations system as a whole is reformed,\r\nrevitalized and rendered more efficacious, transparent,\r\naccountable and democratic.\r\nThe United Nations, as the universally accepted\r\nmatrix of multilateralism, must, in the post-cold-war era,\r\nplay a vastly expanded role in the domain of peace-\r\nkeeping and make a positive contribution to the new\r\nphenomenon of globalization and its increased levels of\r\neconomic and social interdependence, as well as the\r\ntechnologically fuelled transnational linkages among the\r\ncountries of the world. The Organization therefore faces\r\nan inescapable imperative for reform and revitalization.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nIn this regard, my delegation is deeply perturbed by\r\nthe slow progress made by the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. We in\r\nAfrica maintain that the present arrangement, in which\r\nAfrica and Latin America have no permanent\r\nrepresentatives on the Security Council, while Asia has only\r\none, is unjust and antidemocratic and must not be allowed\r\nto continue. Those three regions should each have at least\r\ntwo permanent seats, with incumbents enjoying the same\r\nrights and privileges as the present permanent members.\r\nAdditional non-permanent seats should also be allocated to\r\neach of those regions so as to ensure equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation proportionate to the numerical strength of\r\neach region in this Organization.\r\nIn other areas of reform, our primary objective should\r\nbe to reaffirm the role of the General Assembly as the\r\nhighest decision-making body in the entire United Nations\r\nsystem. Any process of restructuring, revitalization or\r\nstrengthening should necessarily redress the erosion of the\r\nprinciple of the accountability of all principal and\r\nsubsidiary organs and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations to the General Assembly. My delegation will\r\ntherefore seek resolutely to uphold the authority of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as enshrined in the Charter and,\r\nconsequently, will oppose any proposals or\r\nrecommendations that might lead to the usurpation of the\r\nauthority of the General Assembly under any guise or form.\r\nAccordingly, we will not agree to authorizing the\r\nSecretariat to amend, postpone or cancel any official\r\nprogramme activities without the express approval of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, whose prerogative it is to give, change\r\nor withdraw the mandates of such programme activities.\r\nMy delegation is of the strong view that reform should\r\nnot necessarily be equated with the downsizing of the\r\nUnited Nations system. We also feel that an optimally\r\nstreamlined and strengthened United Nations system will\r\nnot necessarily be responsive to the needs of its\r\nmembership as long as it is subjected to chronic cash-flow\r\nproblems. The appalling record of some Member States that\r\ndishonour their financial obligations to the United Nations\r\nand our endless lamentations over the resultant financial\r\ncrises have clearly brought into question the credibility of\r\nthe Organization and the commitment of its membership. In\r\nour view, the time is long past for us to re-examine all the\r\nefforts that we have been exerting in an endeavour to\r\nidentify and agree on the formulation and mechanisms to\r\ndeal with the current financial crisis that has beset the\r\nOrganization. Unless Member States take serious steps to\r\nclear their arrears and improve their payment pattern by\r\nremitting their assessed contributions promptly, in full and\r\nwithout conditions, the United Nations will continue to\r\ndither on the brink of bankruptcy and its efficacy will be\r\ntotally compromised. It is imperative that we, the Member\r\nStates, create a capacity for the Organization to fulfil the\r\nmandate we have given to it.\r\nThe United Nations’ role in maintaining international\r\npeace and security must of necessity have a global thrust\r\nin both the geographical sense and the conceptual\r\nframework. Peace-threatening conflicts in any part of our\r\nglobal village should never be seen to attract differential\r\nattention depending upon their geographical location,\r\nstrategic interest, ethnic complexion or such other narrow\r\nconsiderations of the big Powers.\r\nThe much-belated intervention and subsequent\r\nfailure of the United Nations in Somalia and its half-\r\nhearted interventions in Rwanda, Burundi and Liberia\r\nhave exposed the Organization to harmful criticism, which\r\nhas led to a further decline in its credibility. United\r\nNations peacekeeping efforts in Africa have generally met\r\nwith mixed fortunes. We have yet to see the Namibian\r\nand Mozambican success stories repeat themselves in\r\nseveral other trouble spots on the continent.\r\nAlthough the peace process in Angola continues to\r\nrun behind schedule, we are persuaded that the seeds of\r\nlasting peace have been sown in that country. We need to\r\nredouble our efforts in urging the Angolans to persevere\r\nalong the present bumpy road of peace on the basis of\r\nnational reconciliation and unity.\r\nAlthough the humanitarian situation in Somalia has\r\nimproved somewhat since the intervention of the United\r\nNations, that country remains in political turmoil from\r\nwhich it cannot rescue itself fully without the sustained\r\ninvolvement of the international community. We therefore\r\ncall upon the international community, through the United\r\nNations, to review its current minimalist approach to\r\nSomalia, explore new possibilities for constructive\r\nengagement and give peace another chance.\r\nIn Burundi, the fundamental challenge of having\r\ndemocracy with security has now been compounded by\r\nthe need to stop generalized violence and to return the\r\ncountry to constitutionality. The United Nations should\r\nsupport the sterling efforts of Burundi’s neighbours to\r\nassist that country to achieve peace and stability. The\r\ntragedy of genocide in Rwanda must not be allowed to\r\nrepeat itself in Burundi. No!\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nIn Liberia, brute force and violence must not be\r\nallowed to triumph. The parties should be made to honour\r\nthe peace agreement already reached through the good\r\noffices of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates. The people of Liberia have suffered enough. The\r\nUnited Nations must send a clear message to the warlords\r\nin that country that our common humanity may soon impel\r\nus to try them for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\r\nWith regard to the stalled peace process in Western\r\nSahara, it is imperative that the international community,\r\nthrough the United Nations, honour the spirit and letter of\r\nthe commitment it made to the disenfranchised people of\r\nthat territory and ensure that a free and fair United Nations-\r\nsupervised referendum takes place there on the basis of the\r\nUnited Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara.\r\nIn the Middle East, we appeal to the new Government\r\nof Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to\r\ncontinue on the path of peace and reason, as espoused by\r\nthe late Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, who\r\npaid with his life that the two peoples might live together\r\nin peace and harmony. Renewing the construction of\r\nsettlements on Palestinian land is no contribution to peace.\r\nIt undermines the peace process. There is no alternative to\r\npeace. We therefore urge the parties to remain committed\r\nto the peace process until Palestinian self-determination and\r\na Palestinian State become realities. It is only in this\r\ncontext that the security of Israel can be guaranteed.\r\nCommitment to peace has remained the centrepiece of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. Thirty-five years ago, the\r\nfounding fathers of this Movement had a vision of a world,\r\ninter alia, living in peace and harmony, free of nuclear\r\nthreat and super-Power rivalry. Two days ago, we had\r\noccasion to commemorate that vision. We found it to be as\r\nrelevant and powerful today as when it was first articulated\r\n35 years ago. We recommitted ourselves, among other\r\nthings, to pursuing the goal of a world at peace, free from\r\nthe threat of weapons of mass destruction. We reaffirmed\r\nthat complete nuclear disarmament is a sine qua non for the\r\nsurvival of humanity on our planet. We therefore appeal to\r\nall nuclear Powers to agree to ban the production, testing\r\nand use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and other\r\nweapons of Armageddon.\r\nTo enhance this Organization’s accountability and\r\ncredibility, the decision-making process with regard to\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping mandates must cater to an\r\nincreased role for the general membership of the\r\nOrganization, starting with troop-contributing countries.\r\nFurthermore, efforts such as those which entail preventive\r\ndiplomacy and post-conflict peace-building, as spelled out\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, “Supplement to an\r\nAgenda for Peace”, clearly fall within the domain of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Moreover, it is our view that the\r\nUnited Nations is the only Organization which is uniquely\r\ncharged with a global mandate to maintain international\r\npeace and security. This means therefore that regional\r\npeace-keeping efforts can only complement and not\r\nsubstitute the leading role of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations should also enhance its role in\r\npromoting international cooperation in other spheres of its\r\ncompetence, particularly that of trade. Only a few months\r\nago, the international community celebrated the successful\r\nlaunching of the World Trade Organization, following\r\nprotracted multilateral trade negotiations. For this new\r\nmultilateral trade regime to work, it is imperative that\r\nmember States resist the temptation to initiate practices or\r\npolicies that seek to compromise the sovereignty of other\r\nmember States or to reintroduce colonialism in another\r\nguise. Developed countries should live up to their\r\ncommitments and abandon protectionist policies if all\r\ncountries are to benefit from the new trading\r\narrangements. Improved market access and increased\r\nforeign direct investment must be accompanied by new\r\nand innovative ways to tackle the debt burden of\r\ndeveloping countries, with a view to finding a\r\ncomprehensive and once-and-for-all solution to the debt\r\nproblem.\r\nGiven the negative economic trends in some of our\r\ncountries, the developed countries and international\r\nfinancial institutions should seriously consider debt-\r\nforgiveness for low-income developing countries. Such a\r\ncourse of action would stop the flight of much-needed\r\nresources from these countries and create new possibilities\r\nfor real savings for investment and growth. I wish to\r\naffirm that we, the developing countries, fully accept and\r\nrecognize that we bear the primary responsibility for our\r\nown development; we have accordingly undertaken\r\nvarious economic structural adjustment reforms, often at\r\nenormous social and political cost. These ambitious and\r\npainful reforms could flounder if developed countries fail\r\nto complement these sterling efforts by taking decisive\r\nmeasures to reduce the stock of our debt and by removing\r\nthe wall of protectionist barriers. We also call on the\r\ndeveloped countries to take decisive measures, as a matter\r\nor urgency, to increase the flow of official development\r\nassistance, private investment and the transfer of\r\ntechnologies to developing nations.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nIn a few days, world leaders will assemble in Rome\r\nfor yet another world summit. This time, the international\r\ncommunity will focus its attention on the important\r\nquestion of food security and the good health of the people\r\nof the world. Unfortunately, even the increased food\r\nsupplies in the world are inaccessible to more than 1.5\r\nbillion hungry people who are acknowledged to be living in\r\nabject poverty. We cannot accept that the legacy of hungry\r\nand malnourished people is what our generation will\r\nbequeath to the twenty-first century.\r\nWe expect development to bring food to our dining\r\ntables, clean water into our homes, better housing,\r\nimproved health and security to all our children. The\r\npresent trend towards globalization and the deepening\r\ninterdependence among economies should foster a universal\r\nfeeling and sense of belonging to the global village whose\r\nconcept we have now come to take for granted, but whose\r\nbenefits accrue to only a few countries.\r\nOnly last week, this Assembly carried out a review of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s. In the statements made by\r\nrepresentatives of African countries, it was made\r\nabundantly clear that the international commitments made\r\nin 1991, like those made at the launching of United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment 1986-1990 earlier, had not been fulfilled. We\r\ntherefore call on the international community, and our\r\ndevelopment partners in particular, to mobilize the requisite\r\nfinancial resources to augment our efforts and give fresh\r\nimpetus to the realization of the goals set out in United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s.\r\nWhen the founding fathers of the United Nations\r\noutlined the purposes and principles of this Organization,\r\nthey envisioned a United Nations that would\r\n“be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\r\nthe attainment of these common ends.”\r\nAs we seek to enhance the relevance of this\r\nOrganization to the world today, it is imperative that we\r\nunderstand that the vast majority of the people of this world\r\nexpect the United Nations to be a principal actor for\r\nprogress and change, and to be equipped to play an\r\neffective and leading role in improving the economic and\r\nsocial situation of the world’s citizens. As we\r\ncommemorate the International Year for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty, we are alarmed at the growing extent of abject\r\npoverty, which now engulfs 20 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation. That poverty is the root cause of most of the\r\nworld’s social ills, including strife and peace-threatening\r\nconflicts, cannot be overemphasized. We appeal to\r\nGovernments the world over to respond in earnest to the\r\nclarion call of the Copenhagen world social summit and\r\nto spare no effort at both the national and international\r\nlevels, to roll back the advancing scourge of poverty.\r\nIt is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty\r\nand the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable\r\ndevelopment will remain impossible to achieve unless\r\nnations show renewed political resolve to implement\r\npolicies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage\r\nand live with its environment, as agreed to at the Rio\r\nde Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences. The\r\never-dwindling natural resource base, global warming,\r\npersistent droughts and desertification are eloquent\r\nreminders that humankind’s current destructive processes\r\nof growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the search for safer,\r\nenvironmentally sound and sustainable approaches to\r\ndevelopment, including the utilization of new and\r\nrenewable resources, has become more urgent now than\r\never before.\r\nOnly last week, leaders from 103 countries, from all\r\nregions of the world, heeding this historic challenge of\r\nour time, gathered in Harare, Zimbabwe, for the first-ever\r\nWorld Solar Summit to map out strategies aimed at\r\npromoting the development and utilization of solar and\r\nother forms of renewable energy. In recognition of the\r\nimportant role that solar energy can play in the\r\nadvancement of socio-economic development and in\r\nreducing environmental degradation, the Summit adopted\r\na comprehensive World Solar Programme 1996-2005 with\r\na view to creating effective mechanisms to speed up and\r\nfacilitate the use of solar energy. We call upon the United\r\nNations Secretary-General, the specialized agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations, non-governmental organizations and the\r\ninternational community at large to lend the necessary\r\nfinancial and other forms of support to the Programme to\r\nenable it to succeed.\r\nIn June 1997 another conference of equal\r\nenvironmental significance, the International Convention\r\non Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), will convene\r\nin Harare. The challenges facing this conference will by\r\nno means be small. Global conservation strategies and\r\npolicies have to be implemented in the national interest\r\nand within the means available for the benefit of each\r\ncountry. We in southern Africa have adopted effective\r\nconservation policies over the years that have seen the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\ngrowth of our elephant herd beyond the levels our\r\necosystem can support. It would be unfortunate, and indeed\r\nan irony of our times, if we, who have conceived and\r\nsuccessfully implemented innovative wildlife conservation\r\npolicies, should find ourselves being penalized for our\r\nsuccess and the failure of others. The international\r\ncommunity has an obligation to adopt new, dynamic and\r\nflexible policies that would enable countries such as South\r\nAfrica, Namibia, Botswana and my own country to reap the\r\nbenefits of their wildlife conservation successes. To act\r\notherwise would be counter-productive and an injustice to\r\nthe noble cause of wildlife conservation as a whole. My\r\ncountry intends to make constructive suggestions on this\r\nsubject at the CITES meeting next year.\r\nTo remain relevant and effective, the United Nations\r\nmust stay at the centre stage of global activities. Its\r\nworldwide responsibilities cannot be delegated; nor can its\r\nCharter-enshrined priorities be subordinated to issues\r\nextraneous to its purposes and principles. We are taken\r\naback by the efforts of those who seek to prescribe to the\r\nUnited Nations a reform exercise that would force the\r\nOrganization to diminish and to reorient its Charter-\r\nenshrined role in promoting development to the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization and the\r\nblind forces of the market. The Charter envisaged an\r\nidentifiable role for the United Nations in promoting\r\ndevelopment, which is a prerequisite for, and the ultimate\r\ncorollary of, peace.\r\nMy delegation maintains that the United Nations is\r\nuniquely placed to play a policy-making and resource\r\nidentification role. Its decisions must necessarily set the\r\npace and direction for other institutions such as the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, the strength of the United Nations lies\r\nin its universality and its impartiality in implementing its\r\nmandate to promote peace and security, economic and\r\nsocial development, human rights and international law as\r\noutlined in its Charter.\r\nWhereas the Organization has clearly played a\r\nsignificant role in the containment and settlement of\r\ndisputes through peace-keeping activities, and in the\r\nexpansion and codification of international law, it has\r\nlargely failed to have any significant impact on the\r\ndevelopment process in developing countries. The few\r\ndeveloping countries that have managed to score any\r\nbreakthroughs have done so in spite of the United Nations.\r\nAs the General Assembly outlines its medium-term plan for\r\nthe period 1998-2003, my delegation, together with others,\r\nwill seek to ensure that the development process,\r\nparticularly Africa’s economic recovery and development,\r\nis underwritten by the Organization’s irrevocable\r\ncommitment.\r\nFinally, let me turn to the agenda item dealing with\r\nthe election of the Secretary-General of this Organization.\r\nSince it is an item on the agenda of this Assembly, it is\r\nimperative that Member States freely express their views\r\non this matter. We of Africa have a clear and\r\nunambiguous position. We believe that it is Africa’s turn\r\nto provide a Secretary-General. We have had one term so\r\nfar and, following the normal practice, are entitled to a\r\nsecond term. The African leaders, meeting in Yaoundé,\r\nCameroon, this year, endorsed the candidature of the\r\nincumbent, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nWe stand ready to engage all Members of this\r\nOrganization in the process of finalizing consultations on\r\nthis subject.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, His Excellency Mr. Choi Su Hon.\r\nMr. Choi Su Hon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea) (spoke in Korean; English text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): I should like first of all, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,\r\nto congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election as\r\nPresident. We are pleased that Malaysia, an Asian\r\ncountry, has assumed the presidency of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We believe that the rich\r\nexperience he has gained in the course of dealing with\r\ninternational issues will crown the current session with\r\ngood results.\r\nI should also like to express my gratitude to\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, the former\r\nPresident, for his great contribution to the success of the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly. My\r\nappreciation also goes to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his efforts devoted to\r\nstrengthening the United Nations.\r\nThe building of a new world free from all forms of\r\ndomination and subjugation, and aggression and war has\r\nlong been the common and cherished aspiration of the\r\nworld’s peoples. However, domination and subjugation,\r\nand subordination and inequality still predominate in\r\ninternational relations — even today, after the end of the\r\ncold war — and this constitutes a great challenge to the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nrealization of world peace and security and the\r\ndemocratization of international society.\r\nRecent developments in the international arena are\r\neloquent proof of the fact that every country should firmly\r\nmaintain its independence in order to safeguard its national\r\ndignity and rights and to build a free and prosperous world.\r\nFor the Korean people, the last half-century has been\r\na period of struggle and progress in their efforts to\r\nconsolidate and develop our style of socialism and to\r\nreunify the divided country despite all kinds of challenges\r\nand difficulties.\r\nThough caught in the vortex of the complex and\r\nfluctuating international situation surrounding the Korean\r\npeninsula, the Korean people have been able to march\r\nforward continuously along the road to socialism — which\r\nthey themselves chose — without any vacillation,\r\ndisappointment or vicissitude, despite the fact that on an\r\nuntrodden and poorly paved path, every step is difficult.\r\nThis has been possible because they have firmly maintained\r\nindependence in all domains of state-building on the basis\r\nof the Juche idea, the political philosophy of the Korean\r\npeople.\r\nThe Juche idea, based on the philosophical principle\r\nthat man is the master of everything and decides\r\neverything, regards the popular masses as the driving force\r\nof the socio-historical movement, and identifies the people’s\r\nstruggle for independence, sovereignty and development as\r\nthe way to realize their independence. We have carried out\r\nour independent policy on the basis of the Juche idea,\r\nrelying on the strength of our own people. In international\r\nrelations, we have firmly adhered to the principle of not\r\ninfringing upon the sovereignty of others and of not having\r\nour own sovereignty violated.\r\nAt a time when international relations and the situation\r\nare becoming increasingly complicated, it becomes ever\r\nmore important for a small country like ours firmly to\r\nmaintain an independent stand. The Juche philosophy,\r\ncreated by the fatherly leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, the\r\nfounding father of our socialist Korea, and our independent\r\npolicy, based on this philosophy, have been credibly\r\nfollowed by the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il. The\r\ngreat leader Comrade Kim Jong Il has guided wisely all the\r\naffairs of our Party, State and army for more than three\r\ndecades, and thus has consolidated and developed our\r\nunique style of socialism into an indestructible one.\r\nThe leader and the people are firmly united in one\r\nidea and will, and the independent policy based on the\r\nJuche idea has deep roots in our territory. As a result,\r\nthere has been neither a political vacuum nor instability\r\nin our society, and our style of socialism is advancing\r\nvigorously, regardless of what others may say.\r\nIt is the greatest fortune and happiness for our\r\npeople to have the respected Comrade Kim Jong Il, the\r\noutstanding politician and iron-willed brilliant\r\nCommander, as the supreme leader of the Party and State\r\nand the Supreme Commander of the revolutionary armed\r\nforces. Under the wise leadership of the great leader\r\nComrade Kim Jong Il, our people will make their country\r\nprosperous and realize the fatherly leader\u0027s lifelong\r\nteachings on reunification, convinced of the victory of our\r\nstyle of socialism.\r\nWe hold that the question of national reunification\r\nshould also be settled in the interests of the Korean nation\r\nin the context of the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, based on the specific conditions of our\r\ncountry. In view of current realities in the North and\r\nSouth of Korea, characterized by different ideas and\r\nsystems, national reunification through confederation is\r\nthe only way to achieve a great national unity\r\nindependently and peacefully, on the principle of neither\r\nside conquering or being conquered by the other. It is\r\nquite natural that the proposal for national reunification\r\nthrough confederation set forth by Comrade Kim Il Sung,\r\nthe fatherly leader of our people, enjoys worldwide\r\nsupport.\r\nThe pressing issue in the realization of national\r\nreunification through confederation on the Korean\r\npeninsula is the establishment of a new institutional\r\nmechanism for easing tensions and ensuring peace and\r\nsecurity. Since the Armistice Agreement, signed in 1953,\r\nand the Military Armistice Commission, the executive\r\nbody of the Agreement, remain paralysed by unilateral\r\nmeasures on the part of the United States, the\r\nestablishment of a new peace arrangement is imperative\r\nin order to avert the danger of accidental conflicts, and\r\nfor the maintenance of security on the Korean peninsula.\r\nAccordingly, in April 1994 the Government of the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea advanced a\r\nproposal for the establishment of a new peace\r\narrangement to replace the outdated system of Korean\r\narmistice in ensuring peace and security on the Korean\r\npeninsula. It also advanced in February of this year an\r\nepoch-making proposal to conclude an interim agreement\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nbetween the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and the\r\nUnited States, a proposal that delineates in detail a new\r\npeace arrangement that takes account of the United States\r\npolicy towards Korea and the present status of Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea-United States bilateral relations.\r\nThe interim agreement may include issues concerning\r\nthe management of the Military Demarcation Line and\r\nDemilitarized Zone; ways of addressing cases of armed\r\nconflict and accidents; the composition, duties and terms of\r\nreference of a joint military body; and other issues related\r\nto the maintenance of security and order.\r\nThe United States and South Korean authorities,\r\nhowever, replied to our peace-loving proposal by\r\naggravating tensions with large-scale war exercises and an\r\narms build-up on the Korean peninsula. This situation\r\nurgently requires the establishment of a legitimate channel\r\nfor contacts between military personnel, with a view to\r\npreventing accidental armed conflicts and the recurrence of\r\nwar. It is on the basis of this consideration that the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea proposed to the\r\nUnited States working negotiations for talks relating to the\r\nconclusion of the interim agreement, and the establishment\r\nof an interim mechanism responsible for its implementation,\r\nbetween the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and\r\nUnited States military authorities, the real parties to the\r\nKorean Armistice Agreement.\r\nThere is no doubt that the conclusion of an interim\r\nagreement between the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States will constitute a breakthrough\r\nfor the negotiations on the signing of an agreement aimed\r\nat the maintenance of a durable peace, and it will, in turn,\r\neventually lead to the creation of an atmosphere favourable\r\nfor the implementation of the Agreement on Reconciliation,\r\nNon-Aggression and Exchanges and Cooperation, between\r\nthe North and South, adopted by the North and South of\r\nKorea.\r\nIf the United States is truly interested in the\r\nmaintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula, as it\r\nmentioned while proposing the “four-party talks”, it should\r\nbe willing to withdraw United States troops from South\r\nKorea. On the other hand, the United Nations should take\r\nits own measures, without delay, to retrieve its name and\r\nflag from United States troops in South Korea, thus helping\r\nto establish a new peace arrangement on the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nThe existence of the United Nations Command in\r\nSouth Korea constitutes a legal obstacle to turning the state\r\nof armistice into a durable peace and terminating the cold\r\nwar on the Korean peninsula. The United Nations\r\nCommand was not established by a United Nations\r\nresolution. It is only a product of the cold-war era, which\r\ncame into existence through the abuse of the name of the\r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations Command has moved\r\ntowards dissolution without any United Nations\r\nresolutions during the post-war period, and consequently\r\nonly United States troops remain there today.\r\nThis stark fact presents a vivid illustration of the fact\r\nthat the “US-ROK Joint Command” is usurping the\r\nhelmets of United Nations forces and the name of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the past two years since the adoption of the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea-United States\r\nFramework Agreement, we have been sincerely fulfilling\r\nour obligations under the Agreement, as we have shown\r\nby freezing all of our nuclear facilities. For the full\r\nimplementation of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea-United States Framework Agreement, which is\r\naimed at the fundamental resolution of the nuclear issue\r\non the Korean peninsula, the United States should, among\r\nother things, fulfil its obligations, including lifting\r\neconomic sanctions against the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea; and the present Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea-United States relationship of\r\nconfrontation should be transformed into a relationship\r\nbased on trust.\r\nThere is also a need for several other countries\r\npursuing unfriendly policies towards the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea to change their attitudes,\r\nwhich would certainly be conducive to facilitating a\r\nresolution of the issue. We will make every effort to\r\nensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in\r\nthe region of North-East Asia.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish to express my deep\r\ngratitude to the Governments of various countries, the\r\naffiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system, including the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, non-governmental organizations,\r\nand individuals for their moral, material and humanitarian\r\nassistance and encouragement to our people, which have\r\nbeen provided in the hope of removing, as quickly as\r\npossible, the damage caused in recent years by successive\r\nnatural disasters.\r\nIn order to eliminate the legacies of the cold-war\r\nera, which has been negated by history, and to enable all\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\ncountries and nations to exercise their sovereignty on an\r\nequal footing, international society should be democratized.\r\nThe United Nations should, first of all, be restructured into\r\na democratized Organization. The restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations should be undertaken in a way that will\r\nfully represent the interests of developing countries, which\r\nform the majority of United Nations Member States, and\r\nalso ensure the exercise of their sovereignty in the process\r\nof resolving major international issues.\r\nOnly when the United Nations is restructured will it be\r\nable to do its part in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security and ensure democracy and impartiality in its\r\nactivities. The priority for the democratization of the United\r\nNations is to enhance the authority of the General\r\nAssembly, the body in which all Member States are\r\nrepresented equally. We consider that issues relating to\r\ninternational peace and security should be brought directly\r\nto the General Assembly for deliberation, and that a new\r\nsystem should be established to endorse Security Council\r\nresolutions on the use of force, sanctions and peace-keeping\r\noperations. Such measures would enable the Security\r\nCouncil to give full consideration to the interests of\r\nMember States and thus prevent the adverse effects suffered\r\nby many countries as a result of the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nThe restructuring of the Security Council is the most\r\nessential element in the democratization of the United\r\nNations. There are a number of issues to be resolved in\r\nrestructuring the Security Council, and we consider it\r\nreasonable to proceed with the restructuring gradually,\r\nbased on the principle of first finding issues on which\r\nagreement can be reached and achieving consensus on each\r\nof them. From this viewpoint, we believe that consensus\r\nmay be reached on issues concerning the enlargement of\r\nthe non-permanent membership of the Security Council and\r\nthe improvement of its working methods, both of which\r\nhave already been agreed upon in principle by Member\r\nStates.\r\nIn this regard, our delegation considers that it is\r\npossible for Member States to agree upon, above all, issues\r\nsuch as offsetting the imbalance in regional distribution\r\nthrough an increase of more than 10 seats in the\r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council, to be\r\nallocated among the regions of Asia, Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica, and through providing the countries concerned,\r\nincluding the parties to disputes, with access to informal\r\nconsultations of the Security Council.\r\nJapan is taking advantage of the proposed\r\nenlargement of the permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil by attempting to become a permanent member\r\neven though, as a defeated State of the Second World\r\nWar, it has failed to make an appropriate apology or\r\nprovide compensation for its war crimes but, instead, is\r\ntrying to justify them after more than half a century has\r\npassed. This makes a mockery of Member States,\r\nparticularly the Asian countries.\r\nDisarmament — especially nuclear disarmament —\r\nremains one of the most important problems for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\r\nbelieve that the nuclear-weapon States should provide\r\nnegative security assurances to the non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates, commit themselves to the non-use of nuclear\r\nweapons, and draw up and implement a timetable for\r\ntheir complete abolition.\r\nDespite the end of the cold war, regional, religious\r\nand ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in\r\nvarious parts of our planet, and consequently world peace\r\nand security are gravely disturbed and peoples are\r\nsuffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them. It\r\nis our consistent stand that disputes between countries and\r\nnations should be settled immediately through dialogue\r\nand negotiation in the interests of the parties concerned\r\nand in conformity with international peace and security.\r\nAt present, the maintenance of peace and security in\r\nNorth-East Asia is one of the most vitally important\r\nproblems. In order to ensure peace and security in North-\r\nEast Asia, the arms race and any attempt aimed at\r\nfostering military collusion with outside forces should be\r\nbrought to an end. However, the military collusion\r\nbetween the United States and Japan is being intensified,\r\nand furthermore, the United States, Japan and South\r\nKorea are becoming less disguised in their attempt to\r\nbuild up a tripartite military alliance by repeatedly\r\nlaunching joint military exercises in this region on the\r\npretext of North Korea’s so-called invasion.\r\nIn particular, the arms race is further accelerated\r\nbecause the Japanese authorities are resorting to the\r\nunreasonable policy of trying to become a military super-\r\nPower, building up their arms and developing nuclear\r\nweapons. We strongly urge the Japanese authorities to end\r\ntheir confrontational acts against the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea, including an arms build-up under the\r\nveil of an “immediate response in case of emergency”.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nThe question of social and economic development is\r\ndirectly linked with international peace and security, and its\r\nresolution is therefore one of the important tasks before the\r\nUnited Nations. We hope that agreement will soon be\r\nreached on issues with regard to the implementation of the\r\ncommitment to official development assistance and the\r\nalleviation of external debt, thereby facilitating the\r\ncompletion of the Agenda for Development at the earliest\r\npossible date in the Ad Hoc Open-Ended Working Group\r\non an Agenda for Development.\r\nWe consider that reform of the United Nations in the\r\nfields of social and economic development should be\r\ndirected towards strengthening the agencies responsible for\r\ndevelopment cooperation under the United Nations system,\r\nthereby contributing to accelerating the implementation of\r\nthe declarations and action plans for the development of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe application of “selectivity”, which relates\r\ndevelopment cooperation and technology transfer to\r\nquestions of “human rights” and “terrorism”, should no\r\nlonger be tolerated, and measures such as economic\r\nsanctions should be eliminated to ensure the economic\r\ndevelopment of Member States and regions.\r\nThe Government of our Republic, which regards the\r\nman-centred Juche idea as its guiding idea, is providing all\r\nits people with political, economic and cultural rights and\r\nlegally protecting the lives and dignity of human beings.\r\nWe reject the politicization of human rights, which abuses\r\nthe “question of human rights” in order to infringe upon\r\nthe sovereignty of other countries, and we oppose all\r\nforms of terrorism jeopardizing human lives, as well as\r\nany activities encouraging or assisting terrorist acts.\r\nToday, all justice-loving and peace-loving countries\r\nand nations are making active efforts to establish a new\r\nworld order and equitable international economic relations\r\nfor the twenty-first century. We express our appreciation\r\nto the Asian countries in their efforts to ensure peace and\r\nstability and to achieve common prosperity in their\r\nregions. It is good that the Asia-Europe meeting, held\r\nearly in 1996, agreed upon the strengthening of economic\r\nlinks and cooperation between the continents.\r\nWe support the Arab and Syrian people in their\r\neffort to strengthen unity and cooperation, and to achieve\r\na fair and comprehensive resolution of the Middle-East\r\nquestion, including the Palestinian issue, and we express\r\nsolidarity with the Libyan people in their struggle to\r\ndefend the sovereignty of their country.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity to resolve social and economic issues and\r\ndisputes in the African region. We express solidarity with\r\nthe just cause of the Cuban people to lift the blockade\r\nagainst Cuba, and, with the Latin American people in\r\ntheir endeavours for peace and prosperity in their region.\r\nWe will continue as before to develop relations of\r\nfriendship and cooperation with all countries of the world\r\non the basis of ideas of independence, peace and\r\nfriendship and will endeavour to fulfil the obligations\r\nentrusted to us in the achievement of the common cause\r\nof humankind for world peace and security under the wise\r\nleadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea will make sincere efforts towards the successful\r\noutcome of the debates on the agenda items before this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
