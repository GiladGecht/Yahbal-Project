(Malaysia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Urbizo Panting\r\n(Honduras), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka,\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Lakshman Kadirgamar.\r\nMr. Kadirgamar (Sri Lanka): For Sri Lanka it is a\r\nmatter of particular pride and pleasure that we have a\r\ndistinguished representative of an Asian country, Malaysia,\r\npresiding over the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. Sri Lanka and Malaysia have long enjoyed the\r\nwarmest ties of friendship. We congratulate the President,\r\nand offer him our unstinted support. We also wish to\r\nexpress our appreciation of the contribution made to the\r\nsuccess of the historic fiftieth session by His Excellency\r\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal.\r\nLast year at our Special Commemorative Meeting we\r\npledged to bequeath to the twenty-first century a United\r\nNations equipped, financed and structured to serve\r\neffectively the people in whose name it was established.\r\nThis pledge we must not fail to honour. The peoples of the\r\nworld will be watching us closely during this session and\r\nthereafter to see how well we are proceeding to redeem the\r\npromise we made last year in such fine phrases and\r\nrhetoric.\r\nThe financial constraints confronting the\r\nOrganization have tempered the once heady enthusiasm\r\namong nations for radical reform. Sober pragmatic\r\nconclusions now seem inevitable. Yet we must remember\r\nthat our task, as Sri Lanka’s President pointed out last\r\nyear, is to:\r\n“enhance the capacity of the United Nations, rather\r\nthan merely effect economies and scale down its\r\nscope.” (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 35th meeting,\r\np. 9)\r\nA viable resource base for the United Nations can be\r\nassured not only by effecting greater financial\r\nresponsibility and sound management, but also, more\r\nurgently, by a serious commitment by all Members to\r\nhonour the financial obligations they are bound to comply\r\nwith within the terms of the Charter.\r\nWe agree that the Secretariat of our Organization\r\nneeds to be rationalized further. The Organization is now,\r\nI believe, sufficiently mature to effect cuts where cuts are\r\ndue. Programmes affecting developing countries need to\r\nbe lean, effective and sustainable, which is not the same\r\nas saying they should not be touched. Prudent, well-\r\nconceived economies could be, and have been, put into\r\neffect. We must reform, not deform, the Organization.\r\nAbove all, the United Nations desperately needs a sound\r\nfinancial base. Without that, there will be no prospect of\r\nbuilding the streamlined, efficient and effective world\r\nOrganization that we all dream of. We will merely waste\r\nour time and energy building castles in the air.\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nThe working groups on the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system have made some progress, although no\r\nfinality has been reached in regard to the main areas of\r\nfocus. We believe, however, that these efforts should\r\ncontinue. We should redouble our energies to reach\r\nconsensus.\r\nThe main organs of the United Nations, it must be\r\nemphasized, will be credible and effective only to the\r\nextent that they secure the confidence of the general\r\nmembership and ensure that their decisions enjoy general\r\nacceptance. With regard to the Security Council, it is our\r\nview that today’s political and economic realities, rather\r\nthan yesterday’s military power, need to be reflected in any\r\ndecisions to be taken on questions such as that of the\r\npermanent membership of the Council and the enlargement\r\nof its overall membership.\r\nThe United Nations must neither master nor servant\r\nbe.\r\nFirst, despite fashionable theories about the need to\r\nlimit national sovereignty, the members of the Organization\r\nremain sovereign, independent States. Each State, however\r\nsmall and weak it may be, jealously guards its sovereignty.\r\nHence, where the United Nations intervenes, it should do so\r\nexpressly within the terms of the Charter. The consent and\r\ncooperation of States are vital to ensure the success of any\r\nUnited Nations endeavour which impinges on the territory\r\nof a Member State. Only such an approach would guarantee\r\nthe safety and security of United Nations personnel and the\r\nwelfare and interests of the people in the receiving State.\r\nIn playing its role in conflict resolution and\r\npeacemaking, it is important that our Organization should\r\nnot stray into domestic issues and conflicts which are\r\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of the States concerned.\r\nThe Organization should play its role only with the\r\nacceptance of the countries concerned. This position arises\r\nfrom the simple logic that the States concerned are best\r\nequipped, in the first instance, to deal with these issues,\r\nbeing familiar with the socio-economic milieu in which\r\nthey arise. Otherwise, United Nations action could be\r\ncounter-productive and could lead even to the exacerbation\r\nof conflicts. Nor should United Nations mandates be used\r\nto serve the interests of any one State or group of States.\r\nThe United Nations must not be used as a franchise to give\r\nlegitimacy to causes that may not reflect the general will of\r\nthe membership, on whose behalf the Security Council\r\nshould act at all times.\r\nNow more than ever before we must reaffirm our\r\ncollective respect for the fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. The smaller nations of the\r\nworld must receive constant reassurance from the larger\r\nnations that their interests will be safeguarded and their\r\nsovereignty respected. The smaller nations have only the\r\nUnited Nations to look to for the protection of their\r\nnational interests.\r\nFirst, translated into practical terms, developing\r\ncountries, which are under-represented, need to have their\r\nnumbers increased in the Security Council. Secondly,\r\nthere are Member States in the Organization which\r\nadvance arguments to support permanent seats in the\r\nCouncil no less cogent than the arguments tendered 50\r\nyears ago to justify the special status of the current five\r\npermanent members.\r\nMy delegation also notes the useful discussions that\r\nhave taken place on the subject of “An Agenda for\r\nPeace”. We feel that further work needs to be done in this\r\narea.\r\nThe subject matter of the Agenda for Development\r\nis of crucial importance. It underlies the central role of\r\nour Organization in the field of economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment. While noting the progress that has been\r\nachieved in this endeavour, we should reiterate our\r\ncommitment to move speedily in this area which vitally\r\nconcerns the economic advancement and stability of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nI turn now to the problem of terrorism. The epithet\r\n“terrorist” has been too often hurled unjustifiably at\r\ngenuine national liberation movements, those, for\r\ninstance, which struggled against foreign occupation and\r\napartheid. The legitimacy of such organizations has been\r\nrecognized by the United Nations. They are organizations\r\nwhich have sat with us here to discuss the issues which\r\nhad compelled them to armed action. We are happy to see\r\nthose true movements of the people now occupying seats\r\nin this Organization as full Members. We should not\r\nspend time seeking to evolve a comprehensive definition\r\nof terrorism, lest we become helplessly mired in a\r\nsemantic minefield. An international consensus against\r\nterrorism, based on the recognition of stark reality, has\r\nmatured over the years. It is imperative now to implement\r\nthat consensus.\r\nThe world is aware that Sri Lanka has been racked\r\nwith the anguish of a violent ethnic conflict which has\r\nsapped our energies for almost two decades. We have\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nbeen dealing for many years with an armed group which\r\nseeks to dismember our country by violent means, resorting\r\nto terrorism as a means of achieving this illegitimate goal.\r\nThis group — the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\r\n(LTTE) — has been perpetrating a series of terroristic acts,\r\ncausing death and destruction in many parts of my country.\r\nThis extremist group does not in any meaningful sense\r\nrepresent the people they claim to fight for. They have\r\nnever sought a mandate from the people at an election.\r\nThey have kept out of the democratic mainstream, when\r\nmany of the minority parties have entered the consultative\r\nprocess to seek redress for their grievances through\r\ndemocratic means.\r\nWe are working on a set of proposals introduced by\r\nmy Government to address minority grievances, which\r\nincludes far reaching constitutional changes.\r\nThe LTTE does not believe in the path of peaceful\r\nnegotiations, having put their faith in the power of the gun.\r\nThe peace process, they fear, would marginalize them;\r\nhence the recourse to increased violence. We are aware\r\nthat — in terms of finance, equipment and war matériel —\r\nthis group draws support from persons outside our country,\r\nbut not from other States. There is not a single State that\r\nsupports them either in word or deed. They receive support\r\nfrom misguided members of the Tamil community who live\r\nand work in the affluent countries, or through extortion,\r\ndrug trafficking, gun-running, people-smuggling or other\r\nillegal activities in many developed countries, in abuse of\r\nthe hospitality of the host Governments and in violation of\r\ntheir laws.\r\nIn Sri Lanka, the terrorists have deliberately targeted\r\ncivilians. They have bombed a rush-hour commuter train\r\nand busy office buildings and have shot up rural villages,\r\ncausing the death of thousands of innocent civilians,\r\nincluding large numbers of women and children. Many\r\nthousands have been injured and maimed. As Sri Lanka’s\r\nPresident emphasized last year at the fiftieth-anniversary\r\nsession, concerted international action is essential to combat\r\nterrorism and compel terrorists to renounce violence.\r\nOn that occasion President Clinton remarked that no\r\none was immune from terrorism.\r\nThe summit meeting of the Group of Seven and\r\nRussia in Lyon and the subsequent ministerial meeting on\r\nterrorism in Paris took bold initiatives which need to be\r\ndeveloped into practical action. The proposals for a\r\nconvention on terrorist bombings and the proposals to\r\nprevent the abuse of asylum and refugee laws are\r\nparticularly timely initiatives. Sri Lanka looks forward to\r\ntheir elaboration during this session.\r\nEfforts need also to be made to further strengthen\r\nand give legal effect to the 1994 Declaration on Measures\r\nto Eliminate International Terrorism. Now we need more\r\nthan a mere declaration; we need a convention on\r\nmeasures to combat terrorism. Concerted international\r\ncooperation is necessary to ensure that the terrorist does\r\nnot enjoy safe havens anywhere in the world. The\r\nterritory of no State should be permitted to be used in any\r\nmanner that would encourage or sustain terrorist activity\r\nin another. Fund-raising activity on foreign soil in\r\nparticular, either directly or indirectly through so-called\r\ncharitable funds, must be prohibited. Should terrorism be\r\npermitted through international apathy to fester, it would\r\npoison the international body politic, enervating\r\ndemocratic processes, processes the international\r\ncommunity is obliged to sustain.\r\nIt would be myopic for a nation to stand aloof or to\r\ndisown responsibility for combating acts of terrorism\r\nwhich may seem too distant to evoke anything more than\r\ncuriosity. With the English poet John Donne, I would say,\r\n“never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for\r\nthee.” Terrorists have the means to move freely across\r\nborders, have used chemical weapons, and could well\r\nhave access to nuclear weapons.\r\nGlobal interdependence is undoubtedly a modern\r\nreality. However, opinions vary on the real implications\r\nof that phenomenon on the economies of developing\r\ncountries. In the development debate, globalization and\r\nthe call for integration into a single global economic grid\r\nare held out as the primary or even the sole option for\r\ndeveloping countries seeking cooperation with developed\r\ncountries.\r\nBut cooperation must not be confused with\r\nconformity. The specific character of individual\r\ndeveloping countries, including the social and political\r\ncompulsions facing their Governments, needs to be taken\r\ninto account. Globalization involves the free flow of\r\ncapital, the liberalization of trade, the privatization of\r\nState enterprises, the freezing of price controls and the\r\nscaling down of welfare measures even for the most\r\nvulnerable sectors of the population. These have not\r\nalways proved to be a panacea for those developing\r\ncountries which have accepted them as economic\r\ninjunctions.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nIt is important that such institutions as the World\r\nTrade Organization, the successor institution to GATT, be\r\nsensitive to the concerns of developing countries in such\r\nmatters as external investment flows, which should not be\r\nclogged with linkages to issues more relevant to other\r\norganizations and institutions. Similarly, while sound social\r\nand environmental policies are essential for all societies,\r\narbitrarily imposed standards should not be used as excuses\r\nfor trade discrimination or concealed protectionism. The\r\nGovernment of Sri Lanka has provided opportunities for its\r\nprivate sector to advance as the principal engine of growth.\r\nSri Lanka continues to welcome investment — economic\r\nand technological collaboration with foreign entrepreneurs\r\non the basis of mutual benefit. These efforts, however,\r\nwould be negated if such economic cooperation were\r\npursued only on terms overwhelmingly favourable to one\r\nside.\r\nDespite the pressures and tensions caused by a\r\nsituation of conflict, we have succeeded in keeping our old\r\ndemocratic institutions and traditions alive and strong. We\r\ngive our best attention to the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights. In furthering an elected Government’s\r\naccountability to its own people, the Government of Sri\r\nLanka has taken several measures to strengthen the legal\r\nframework and ensure the effective implementation of\r\nhuman-rights standards. One of the significant measures we\r\ntook this year was the establishment by act of Parliament of\r\na Human Rights Commission. We have ensured that the act\r\nguarantees independence of action for the Commission. The\r\nareas of competence of the Commission include monitoring,\r\ninvestigative and advisory functions. The act also addresses\r\nthe question of liability of non-State actors for human-rights\r\nviolations.\r\nMy Government has decided to accede to the Optional\r\nProtocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political\r\nRights as a logical next step in a series of national\r\nmeasures. Sri Lanka will thus be among the few countries\r\nthat have taken the progressive decision to ratify the\r\nOptional Protocol. The Government has given the highest\r\npriority to Sri Lanka’s obligations under international\r\ncovenants and we are committed to continuing our\r\ncooperation with United Nations human-rights mechanisms.\r\nLooking at the world, we see that, in Bosnia,\r\nfollowing the Dayton Agreement, the guns have been\r\nfinally silenced, and we are happy to note that the peace\r\nAgreement is holding up. Sri Lanka has condemned the\r\natrocities committed in Bosnia, particularly the inhuman\r\nand cruel treatment of the Muslims. We believe that a\r\nsettlement will not be complete unless those responsible\r\nfor the atrocities are brought to justice.\r\nIn the Middle East, we hope the peace process will\r\nmove on, without losing the momentum it had gained,\r\ndespite the changes in the political scene in that area. Sri\r\nLanka reiterates its support for the peace process, the\r\nrealization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople and the establishment of conditions of peace and\r\nstability for all States in the region to live within secure\r\nboundaries. We commend the efforts taken by the United\r\nStates of America, other concerned States and the States\r\nof the region to achieve the objective of bringing peace to\r\nthe Middle East.\r\nWe share the concerns of the world community in\r\nregard to the crises that have overtaken Liberia and\r\nBurundi and express our fervent hope that peace will be\r\nrestored to these troubled regions.\r\nIn our own region, South Asia, we have recorded\r\nprogress in our efforts at regional cooperation. We\r\ncelebrated the tenth anniversary of the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) last\r\nDecember, heralded by the coming into force of the South\r\nAsian Preferential Trade Arrangement. SAARC has set\r\nitself the goal of achieving a South Asian free-trade area\r\nby the early years of the new century. The private sectors\r\nof our region are engaged in close cooperation. We\r\nremain deeply committed to our abiding concern of\r\nalleviating, if not eradicating, poverty in our countries\r\nwithin a realistic time-frame.\r\nSri Lanka has turned increasingly towards promoting\r\neconomic cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion with which we identify closely. We see regional\r\ncooperation as a source of political stability as well as\r\nmutual economic benefit. We have recently become a\r\npartner in the Indian Ocean rim initiative. We have\r\napplied for membership of the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council. We also expect that, when the\r\nrequired ratifications are completed, the Indian Ocean\r\nMarine Affairs Cooperation will provide a further impetus\r\nto technical and other cooperation among Indian Ocean\r\ncountries. At the political level, Sri Lanka, with other\r\nmembers of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on\r\nthe Indian Ocean, is reviewing the concept of the Indian\r\nOcean as a zone of peace in the light of current realities\r\nin the region.\r\nI wish to refer at this point to the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, of which Sri Lanka is a founding member.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nToday — 26 September — is a particularly significant date\r\nfor Sri Lanka, which commemorates a great patriot, the late\r\nS.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who was assassinated on this date.\r\nHe was Prime Minister from 1956 to 1959. He ushered in\r\na uniquely peaceful, non-violent transformation of Sri\r\nLankan society. His electoral victory in 1956 led to the\r\nempowerment of the rural, the underprivileged, the mass of\r\nthe people of the country, and set the country’s foreign\r\npolicy firmly towards non-alignment.\r\nTwo days ago, we celebrated the thirty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the founding, in a formal sense, of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. Mr. Bandaranaike did not live to see\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement firmly established in 1961.\r\nHowever, in 1956, 40 years ago, he addressed this General\r\nAssembly and said:\r\n“We are supposed to be the uncommitted\u0027 nations. I\r\nstrongly object to that word. We are committed up to\r\nthe hilt. We are committed to preserve decency in\r\ndealings between nations, we are committed to the\r\ncause of justice and freedom....\r\n“No doubt the prevention of war is a necessary factor\r\nfor peace, but peace, believe me, is something much\r\nmore positive than that, for peace in its true sense\r\nmeans human understanding, human friendship and\r\ncooperation out of which, indeed, peace in its true\r\nform alone can arise. I look upon the United Nations\r\nas the one machine available to mankind today\r\nthrough which it can express this unconquerable spirit\r\nof man in its efforts to achieve that peace, friendship\r\nand collaboration.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Eleventh Session, Plenary Meetings, 590th\r\nmeeting, p. 234-35)\r\nThe policies he initiated in respect of Sri Lanka —\r\nand I confine my remarks to foreign policy — were carried\r\nforward by his successor, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike,\r\nwho, as Prime Minister, attended the first Non-Aligned\r\nsummit in Belgrade in 1961 and subsequently presided over\r\nthe fifth summit of the Movement in Colombo.\r\nThe Movement, which has a membership of 113\r\ncountries, is today the largest grouping of independent\r\nsovereign States in the world, apart from the United\r\nNations itself, which have come together with the common\r\nobjective of achieving peace, prosperity and the welfare of\r\ntheir people, a majority of whom belong to the third world.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, there were sceptics who\r\nthought that the Movement would die in the absence of a\r\nclear role for the future. We have been able to dispel this\r\nmisapprehension and chart a new course for the\r\nMovement. It has emerged today as the voice of the third\r\nworld, of the smaller countries which are crying out for\r\na place in the sun and demanding opportunities for\r\neconomic development and self-expression.\r\nAlthough the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons has been extended indefinitely, it is to\r\nbe remembered that the total elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons is the ultimate end of the non-proliferation\r\nprocess. As a member of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, our delegation has worked hard to ensure\r\nthat all nuclear testing be banned as an interim measure,\r\nleading eventually to the total elimination of all nuclear\r\nweapons. The text of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty adopted by the General Assembly a few days\r\nago was the result of several years\u0027 patient negotiations,\r\nyet its terms do not contain a firm and clear commitment\r\nto nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of all\r\nnuclear weapons. We would have expected the scope of\r\nprohibition to be truly comprehensive and the provisions\r\nfor entry into force not to be self-debilitating. We look\r\nforward to the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention as well as the Convention relating to\r\nbacteriological and toxin weapons.\r\nSri Lanka remains a loyal and dedicated Member of\r\nthe United Nations committed to upholding the noble\r\nprinciples of the Charter. Our faith and trust in this great\r\ninstitution, fashioned half a century ago, despite all its\r\nweaknesses and failures discerned in the intervening\r\nyears, remains steadfast. These blemishes are after all but\r\na mirror-image of the infirmities and inadequacies of all\r\nhuman kind. So we have no need to be either discouraged\r\nor despondent. We stand firm in the belief that the United\r\nNations is still the best hope for this world. Indeed, we\r\nhave no alternative or option in this matter, for to give up\r\nhope is only to slide into the depths of despair.\r\nBut our hopes for the United Nations must be\r\ngrounded in action, in a firm resolve to act decisively in\r\nthe best interests of this great institution, indeed of all\r\nhumanity, untainted by the narrow national interests\r\nwhich have dogged our path in the course of these past\r\nfive decades. This is no easy task, but unless we remain\r\nunyielding in our determination to ensure that the United\r\nNations remains faithful to the tasks envisioned by its\r\nfounders, we will have failed the generations that follow\r\nus in the twenty-first century.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, His\r\nExcellency Mr. José Miguel Insulza.\r\nMr. Insulza (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nFirst of all, Sir, I wish to express our pleasure at seeing the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras — a country with\r\nwhich we have long-standing and well-established ties of\r\nfriendship and with which we are currently working in the\r\nSecurity Council — preside over this meeting. I would also\r\nlike through you to convey my Government\u0027s\r\ncongratulations to Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession.\r\nThis is a transitional period for the United Nations and\r\nis therefore not devoid of complexities and uncertainty. Yet\r\nwe still have confidence in the ability of Member States\r\nand in the privileged forum provided by this Organization\r\nto develop new policies and management structures to deal\r\nwith the gamut of emerging international problems.\r\nAs this session of the General Assembly begins, we\r\nonce again renew our commitment to the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter, the living instrument essential to\r\nthe future work of this Organization. The United Nations is\r\nan Organization which, through its nature, principles and\r\nobjectives, transcends any individual or national interests to\r\nrepresent, instead, the interests of all.\r\nNot even those who criticize the United Nations in the\r\nhopes that they can weaken it or shrink its role have ever\r\nbeen able to propose any better way for us to come\r\ntogether to address the major problems of an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world. That is why we are convinced that,\r\nfar from becoming weaker, this Organization will be called\r\nupon to play an increasingly important role in this new era\r\nof globalization, in which cooperation is the only possible\r\noption for a true international order.\r\nInternational peace and security, free trade, social\r\ndevelopment based on growth with equity, environmental\r\nprotection, democracy and human rights are the basic\r\ncomponents of the future work of our multilateral system.\r\nThese are the areas of action of our Organization to which\r\nChile attaches the highest priority and in which we will try,\r\nwithin our means to make our greatest contribution.\r\nIt has often been said that the end of the super-Power\r\nconfrontation that characterized the first 50 years of the life\r\nof this Organization makes it easier than ever to shape the\r\nconditions for peace and stability. And yet, the challenges\r\nof bipolar confrontation have been replaced by new ones\r\nposed by the emergence of numerous local conflicts.\r\nThese are often characterized by mass violations of\r\nhuman rights, uncontrolled population flows and\r\nhumanitarian emergencies that threaten the security of\r\nindividuals and States and eventually may affect the\r\ninternational system as a whole.\r\nOur participation in the work of the Security Council\r\nis aimed at contributing our fair share to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. We encourage\r\npreventive diplomacy, consensus solutions, the\r\nimplementation of measures to contain conflicts, the\r\npromotion of peaceful solutions through peace-keeping\r\noperations, conciliation, good offices and, in particular,\r\nthe protection of affected populations and victims.\r\nAt the same time, it is indisputable that peace and\r\nsecurity are not simply the absence of tensions and\r\nconflict between States. Harmony between people within\r\nthe same border has now become a fundamental factor in\r\ninternational peace and security. Chile has suggested that\r\nthe Security Council should act in cases where there is a\r\nreal or potential risk of mass and systematic violations to\r\nwhich the international community has reacted strongly\r\nand when earlier mechanisms or bodies trying to resolve\r\nthe problem have been exhausted.\r\nRecent measures adopted by the Council, such as\r\nresolution 688 (1991) on protecting the Kurdish minority,\r\n770 (1992) on providing assistance to victims of the\r\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, resolution 986 (1995)\r\non alleviating the burden of sanctions on the civilian Iraqi\r\npopulation, are a few examples of a broader and more\r\nprogressive interpretation of what constitutes a threat to\r\npeace and establish valuable precedents for helping the\r\nSecurity Council to deal with these kinds of conflict.\r\nThese criteria also guided us in our active\r\nparticipation on the question of Burundi, which led to the\r\nadoption of resolution 1072 (1996) establishing\r\nprocedures for the various parties to the conflict to be\r\nable to agree on a political path to a peaceful resolution\r\nof their differences. We must continue to pay close\r\nattention to developments in this situation. The\r\ninternational community, the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council cannot risk another tragedy like that of\r\nRwanda and must exhaust all possible means of averting\r\nsuch a tragedy.\r\nToday we would also like to express our great\r\nconcern at the serious crisis that has arisen in the last few\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nhours affecting the peace process in the Middle East, a\r\nprocess we have supported from the outset. We urge the\r\nparties to the conflict not to waste what has been built up\r\nin the last few years and to resume dialogue within the\r\ncontext of respect for agreements reached and for the\r\nbeliefs of the peoples involved.\r\nEstablishing stability requires clear commitment to\r\ndisarmament and arms control and limitation. My country\r\nhas played an active role in this area, as shown in the\r\nrecent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention,\r\nmembership in the Conference on Disarmament, which\r\nChile had long aspired to, ratification of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and our\r\nunstinting support for nuclear-weapon-free zones.\r\nLast Tuesday, 24 September 1996, I had the honour to\r\nsign on behalf of my country the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. Just one year ago, this Assembly was\r\ndiscussing the nuclear-weapon tests still being conducted in\r\nthe South Pacific and Asia. Today we are meeting to sign\r\na Treaty that eliminates those tests once and for all and is\r\nthe combined effort of almost all the countries in this\r\nAssembly, including all the present nuclear-weapon States.\r\nWhen the United Nations is criticized for its alleged\r\ninefficiency I think we should also vaunt our successes.\r\nThese initiatives, along with progress in the area of\r\nconventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction,\r\nhelp to create the right conditions for peace and security\r\nand enable the international community to concentrate its\r\nefforts and material resources on the development of\r\nnations and environmental protection.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are one of the most important\r\ninstruments of this system. Peacekeeping forces have to\r\nstrive for results in the framework of clear and well-defined\r\nand legitimate mandates. Chile has participated in\r\npeacekeeping operations in India, Pakistan, the Middle East,\r\nCambodia and Kuwait, and we are currently taking part in\r\nthe activities of the United Nations Special Commission\r\n(UNSCOM) in Iraq.\r\nHowever, there is no doubt that this mechanism needs\r\nto be tailored to dealing with current political\r\ncircumstances. To this end, Chile is active in deliberations\r\non how to improve planning and rapid-reaction capacity to\r\ndeal with incipient conflicts. In all these aspects, a\r\nmultilateral approach, action that enjoys the consent of the\r\nparties and financing through the Organization all help to\r\nensure success in our work. We hope to increase\r\nsignificantly our contribution to operations such as the\r\nones I have just described.\r\nA broad understanding of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security requires decisive action\r\nin the area of social development, democracy and the\r\npromotion of human rights. The world order of the next\r\ncentury will need broader basic freedoms. The global\r\nsociety of the next century is appearing as an open,\r\nheterogenous one, rich in material potential and new\r\ndevelopments. What is needed now is to create conditions\r\nto enable people and States to make the most of this new\r\nsetting, with increased access to the goods that are the\r\nfruit of rapid technological development.\r\nIn this respect, the six recent world conferences and\r\nsummits on the environment and development, human\r\nrights, population and development, women, social\r\ndevelopment and, most recently, human settlements, have\r\nall been geared towards promoting protection of the\r\nindividual and gradually creating a framework for social\r\nrights.\r\nOne tangible result of these meetings, in the social\r\narea, was the emergence of national coordinating bodies\r\nto implement the agreements signed. But these efforts are\r\nnot enough, given the tragic reality of most of the less\r\ndeveloped peoples, which means that the United Nations\r\nsystem must play an ever stronger role in the international\r\nsocial area. We must speed up the process of\r\nimplementation within the context of the United Nations\r\nand of the agreements that emerged from Rio de Janeiro,\r\nVienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul.\r\nThe first steps have now been taken within the\r\nvarious bodies of the system, particularly in the Economic\r\nand Social Council and its functional commissions. It is\r\nencouraging that the Economic and Social Council bodies\r\ndealing with sustainable development, women, social\r\ndevelopment and population have adopted multi-year\r\nagendas as a follow-up to the conferences.\r\nSimilarly, the agreements reached at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development include the decision to\r\nhold a special session of this Assembly in the year 2000\r\nto assess the implementation of the agreements.\r\nIn this connection, Chile wishes to propose the\r\nestablishment of a working group of this Assembly that,\r\nwith that special session as its basis, can provide follow-\r\nup to the six conferences, taking into account the Agenda\r\nfor Development, so that in the year 2000 the General\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nAssembly can take up a very wide-ranging and coordinated\r\nassessment of the implementation of the commitments of\r\nthe 1990s and make the necessary recommendations for\r\nfuture work.\r\nIn recent years Latin America has taken major steps\r\nforward with regard to free trade. This Assembly has\r\nalready heard about progress in the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR), Chile\u0027s recent accession\r\nto that agreement and MERCOSUR’s decision to negotiate\r\nsimilar agreements with the Andean Group and Mexico.\r\nTaken alongside the progress made by other subregional\r\ngroups, such as the Central America Common Market\r\n(CACM) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), these\r\nachievements all go to show the new impetus in Latin\r\nAmerica for integration based on economic ideas that differ\r\nfrom those of the past but that remain true to the political\r\nwill for unity that has always existed among our peoples.\r\nHowever, none of these regional developments in\r\nwhich Chile has been very active constitutes an alternative\r\nto multilateralism. Chile continues to believe that a\r\nmultilateral system to establish standards and practices to\r\nensure free trade throughout the world, with clear\r\ninstitutional machinery for negotiations and dispute\r\nsettlement, is the best option for the global economy and\r\nfor each of our countries.\r\nFor this reason we have always insisted that our\r\nnegotiations fit into the multilateral framework of the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO). Latin America wants to be\r\nintegrated so that it can become more of a part of the\r\nglobal economy, not cut off from it. Our bilateral and\r\nregional agreements are based on open regionalism. The\r\nbest proof that this is being put into practice is that during\r\nthis period of increased integration, external tariffs in the\r\ncountries of our region have also fallen considerably,\r\ncompared with those of the rest of the world.\r\nOne of the most promising developments of recent\r\nyears has been the strengthening of the multilateral trade\r\nsystem through the establishment of the WTO. The\r\nexistence of a standing multilateral forum means that more\r\nenergy can be devoted to implementing the agreements\r\nreached and provides an institutional framework for\r\ncontinuous progress in negotiations and for opening up\r\nworld trade.\r\nIn this connection, Chile attaches great importance to\r\nthe follow-up meeting to the Uruguay Round, to be held in\r\nSingapore in December 1996. This, the first biannual\r\nmeeting in the framework of the WTO, will be crucial in\r\ndetermining how effective the new mechanism is.\r\nIn the last few years many regions and countries in\r\nthe world have made major progress towards broadening\r\nand consolidating democracy and respect for human\r\nrights. Latin America in particular has been experiencing\r\na rapid movement towards democracy that is\r\nunprecedented in its history. This is accompanied by a\r\nconsiderable increase in political dialogue and regional\r\ncoordination, evident mainly in the Rio Group, which has\r\nbeen active and fruitful for 10 years now.\r\nFar from making us complacent, this emphasizes our\r\nconcern that in many parts of the world there are still\r\nsituations of massive violation of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. Sometimes these situations relate\r\nto the peace and security problems we mentioned earlier.\r\nAs democracies develop, the support given them by\r\nthe people depends more and more on their ability to\r\nensure stable, efficient and transparent governments. The\r\nlegitimacy of democratic governments is closely related\r\nto their accountability, but in many countries there is still\r\ncorruption, inefficiency and insensitivity to social needs.\r\nThis erodes the legitimacy of democracy and highlights\r\nits fragility.\r\nThe Government of our President, Eduardo Frei, has\r\nmade democratic governance the main subject of the sixth\r\nsummit of Ibero-American Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, to be held in Chile in November 1996. To\r\nthis end, we have enjoyed the valuable cooperation of the\r\nUnited Nations, through the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). We hope\r\nthat our Organization\u0027s work in this area will spread to\r\nother regions in coming years.\r\nOne of the most dramatic changes for mankind in\r\nthe last few decades has been our awareness that nature\r\nis fragile in the hands of man. There is a vulnerability in\r\nnature we had not suspected until we saw the damage\r\ndone, much of it irreparable. And so there is a new\r\ndimension to human responsibility to nature. The\r\npossibility of altering life on our planet for the worse\r\nmeans that our unbounded scientific and technological\r\npower must be accompanied by a new principle: and that\r\nis the idea of shared responsibility.\r\nThe work facing us is hard, but the path was already\r\nlaid out in 1992 at the Conference on Environment and\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nDevelopment. In Rio de Janeiro there was agreement on\r\nfundamental aspects. On the basis of the consensus, and the\r\ncommitments reached there, my country is prepared to\r\nproceed. Since that Earth Summit, Chile has further\r\ndeveloped its environmental legislation. We have embraced\r\nthe principles of the Rio Declaration that we consider\r\nfundamental, such as preventing environmental pollution,\r\ncooperation and the primary responsibility of the polluter.\r\nThe State has accepted its obligation to adopt the most\r\nsuitable instruments for preventive environmental\r\nmanagement. But we also believe that society must be\r\ngiven a leading role in protecting the environment, and to\r\nthis end various social actors must be more committed and\r\nmore responsible.\r\nMy Government thinks it is also important to stress\r\nthe political commitment of the world community to this\r\nissue that is by nature international and in many respects\r\nglobal. Hence, we attach great importance to the\r\nfunctioning of the bodies set up and to the monitoring of\r\nthe agreements reached at the Earth Summit.\r\nDevelopments in the international arena, the increasing\r\ndiversity of issues to be taken up and the number of actors\r\ninvolved in the United Nations — all of this revitalizing the\r\nreform process of our Organization essential in order to\r\nadapt it to emerging realities and challenges. Integrated and\r\nmultidisciplinary focus must be given preference in dealing\r\nwith these problems. This constitutes the conceptual\r\nframework of the Organization and a basis for the urgently\r\nneeded process of reform. This requires a very thorough\r\nanalysis of the content of our multilateral work, of the\r\nOrganization\u0027s agenda, of the functioning of\r\nintergovernmental bodies, of our human and financial\r\nresources and of the structure of the Secretariat. By doing\r\nall that, we can carry out reforms that are more than\r\nrhetoric, that will enable us to take up the challenges of the\r\nnext century with policies and organizations adapted to the\r\nnew reality.\r\nChile wishes to reiterate its appreciation for the work\r\nbeing done by the Secretary-General in this area. In\r\ndifficult budgetary circumstances and facing a very difficult\r\npolitical situation, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has decisively\r\nbegun, within his purview, the process of reforming the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe welcome all initiatives that can enhance the\r\nefficiency of our Organization, reduce its bureaucratic\r\nexcesses or alleviate its financial problems. But we believe\r\nthat United Nations reform should not be mistakenly\r\nidentified with one single issue of administration or\r\nbudgetary efficiency. There is quite a contradiction\r\nbetween saying that we need an Organization adapted to\r\nthe new challenges and focused on the next century, and\r\nthen reducing the practical debate simply to cost-cutting\r\nand better control of resources. We have to enhance\r\nadministrative efficiency, but we must also appreciate\r\nsubstantive effectiveness. Our objective should be to\r\nstrengthen the Organization as well as to streamline it.\r\nBefore concluding, I cannot fail to mention a\r\nquestion of reform on this year\u0027s agenda that is more\r\nurgent than it was in previous years. The plethora of\r\ndecisions taken by the Security Council has resulted in a\r\ngrowing desire on the part of the other Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to be more involved in Council decisions,\r\nso as to strengthen its legitimacy and the political support\r\nfor its actions.\r\nImproving the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil has opened up additional ways of enhancing its\r\ncredibility. There has been progress, but much remains to\r\nbe done, particularly in connection with consultations with\r\ncountries that contribute troops to peacekeeping\r\noperations, consultations with countries neighbouring a\r\nconflict area that might be affected, and third States that\r\nare negatively affected by the application of sanctions.\r\nA second determining factor of legitimacy and\r\npolitical support for Council decisions relates to its\r\nmembership. In this connection, Chile believes it essential\r\nto resolve once and for all the problems of increasing the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, which have\r\nconcerned the Assembly since 1992. We think there is a\r\nbroad base of agreement for allowing Germany and Japan\r\nto become permanent members of the Council, and at the\r\nsame time for giving developing countries one permanent\r\nseat per region, the occupants of which would be elected\r\nat the regional level.\r\nAlso, in order to meet the need for representativity,\r\ngiven the great increase in membership of the United\r\nNations in the last decade, the number of non-permanent\r\nseats should be increased from 10 to 15, with appropriate\r\nequitable geographical distribution. A membership of\r\ntwenty-five members would not undermine the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council but would enhance\r\nthe representativity of its actions.\r\nHowever, we wish to emphasize that Chile is willing\r\nto act with maximum flexibility here. This means we are\r\nwilling to consider other proposals by other Member\r\nStates that also seek to combine the two fundamental\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nelements that should guide our decision: recognition of the\r\nnew international realities and a legitimate desire for\r\nrepresentativity in the principal bodies of our system.\r\nWe wished to touch upon those issues that, in Chile’s\r\nview, will be the Organization’s main tasks in the years to\r\ncome, with a view to establishing the framework of stability\r\nand legitimacy necessary to achieve United Nations\r\nobjectives. Chile commits its firm support to this difficult\r\nunderstanding, which will be attainable with the will and\r\nparticipation of all members of the international community.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Culture,\r\nYouth and Sport of the Principality of Liechtenstein, Her\r\nExcellency Ms. Andrea Willi.\r\nMs. Willi (Liechtenstein): At the outset I should like\r\nto congratulate Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nThe Liechtenstein delegation is confident that his leadership\r\nwill strengthen the United Nations ability to pursue the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nOne year after the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, it is appropriate to take\r\nstock once again of the achievements and shortcomings of\r\nour Organization and, first and foremost, to define the\r\nmeasures we have to take in order to face the challenges\r\nthat lie ahead of us. One of the recurrent topics at the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly was the call for a\r\ncomprehensive and effective reform with a view both to\r\nenhancing the efficiency of the United Nations and to\r\nreducing the costs of its work.\r\nI wish to express my appreciation for all the efforts\r\nthat have been made by the Secretariat to meet this need,\r\nparticularly to the Department of Administration and\r\nManagement and to the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices, which have made an important contribution in this\r\nregard. However, it remains a fact that more needs to be\r\ndone in order to cope with the financial crisis the\r\nOrganization continues to struggle with. Even though there\r\nseems to be a consensus concerning the need for further\r\nsuch action, we were not able, during the fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, to reach agreement on the measures\r\nthat are so urgently needed. In our view, it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that the high-level working group on the\r\nfinancial situation established by the General Assembly\r\nshould adopt, during the fifty-first session, proposals for a\r\nsolution of the financial crisis, including the payment of\r\narrears. I should like to take this opportunity to express the\r\nsupport of the Government of Liechtenstein for the\r\nproposals that have been put forward by the European\r\nUnion in this respect.\r\nWe support ongoing efforts with a view to a reform\r\nand enlargement of the Security Council. We are of the\r\nview that the reform of the Security Council should be\r\nconsistent with the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nall States, as enshrined in the Charter. Liechtenstein\r\nagrees with those Member countries that have said that\r\nwith regard to the distribution of new permanent seats,\r\nthe financial and other contributions to achieving the\r\npurposes of the Organization as well as a balanced\r\ngeographic distribution should be adequately taken into\r\naccount.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nAnother area of crucial importance for the future\r\nwork and credibility of our Organization is peacekeeping\r\nactivities, which attract the particular interest and concern\r\nof the world community. The experience of the recent\r\npast has made it very clear that the United Nations needs\r\nto be better equipped in order to respond effectively and\r\nquickly to prevent situations that threaten international\r\npeace and security. If we are to enhance the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations as a whole and the effectiveness of\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, we have to\r\nensure that every such mission is given a clear mandate\r\nand vested with the funds necessary for its full\r\nimplementation. Very useful proposals to that end have\r\nbeen made by the Secretary-General in his report entitled\r\n“An Agenda for Peace”. We have noted with satisfaction\r\nthe progress made by the Working Group established by\r\nthe General Assembly to discuss the Agenda for Peace,\r\nand the provisional agreements reached by two of the four\r\nsubgroups dealing with specific aspects of the Agenda for\r\nPeace. I wish to express my hope that the two other\r\nsubgroups, which have to discuss the very important\r\nquestions of preventive diplomacy and peacemaking, and\r\npost-conflict peace-building, respectively, will also be\r\nable to conclude their work soon, so a comprehensive\r\nagreement on the Agenda for Peace can be adopted.\r\nSome of the events that have taken place over the\r\npast few years have made it very clear that more attention\r\nshould be given to preventive diplomacy, which can avert\r\nhuman suffering and reduce costs considerably. One of\r\nthe situations where determined preventive action is\r\nurgently needed is the one that has arisen in Burundi,\r\nwhere patterns of large-scale violations of human rights\r\nand the risk of a further worsening of the situation\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\ncontinue to exist. It is indeed disturbing to note that the\r\ninternational community has not been able to take all\r\npossible measures to prevent a further deterioration of this\r\nsituation.\r\nLiechtenstein made its own contribution to the\r\nfurthering of conflict prevention by introducing an initiative\r\non the right of self-determination before the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. It has been stated\r\nmany times that the vast majority of armed or other violent\r\nconflicts today are no longer conflicts between but within\r\nStates. Such conflicts often have their roots in tensions\r\nbetween communities living within States, and the thrust of\r\nthe initiative of Liechtenstein is aimed at finding peaceful\r\nsolutions to such situations before one of the parties\r\ninvolved resorts to violence. It seems to us that the right of\r\nself-determination, the exercise of which has played a\r\ncrucial role in the history of the United Nations,\r\nprogressively needs to be seen outside its traditional context\r\nand should be further developed and adapted to the\r\nconditions that prevail in today’s world.\r\nMany cases of intra-State conflicts have made clear\r\nthat it is timely and necessary for the international\r\ncommunity to develop mechanisms that will enable\r\ncommunities living within States to exercise the right of\r\nself-determination in flexible ways and in accordance with\r\nexisting international law. The Liechtenstein research\r\nprogramme that was established at Princeton University as\r\npart of the contribution of Liechtenstein to the celebration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is intended\r\nto provide further know-how for, and assistance in,\r\ndeveloping such mechanisms, and I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank all those countries that continue to\r\nsupport us in this endeavour.\r\nAs a small State, Liechtenstein attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to strengthening international law and to\r\neffective disarmament. We therefore actively supported the\r\ndraft resolution, submitted by Australia on behalf of a large\r\nnumber of countries, that enabled us to adopt the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) after\r\nlengthy and very difficult negotiations in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament. The CTBT will take us one step further\r\ntowards achieving our goal of a world free of nuclear\r\nweapons. The Government of Liechtenstein is of the view\r\nthat it is a crucial step. Tomorrow, therefore, I will sign the\r\nCTBT on behalf of Liechtenstein, and I would like to\r\nexpress our hope that as many countries as possible will do\r\nthe same.\r\nOne year ago we met in Beijing and unanimously\r\nadopted a Declaration and a Platform for Action that\r\nrepresent a new international commitment to the goals of\r\nequality, development and peace for all women in the\r\nworld. In Liechtenstein we are in the process of preparing\r\nthe implementation of the Platform for Action, which\r\nincludes, inter alia: motivation for women to enter\r\npolitics and to present their candidatures; specific\r\nacademic and vocational guidance for girls; measures to\r\nfacilitate the compatibility of professional and family life;\r\nand sensitization towards the problem of violence against\r\nwomen and children.\r\nPeace is a prerequisite for the attainment of equality\r\nbetween women and men. Unfortunately, aggression and\r\narmed and other types of conflict persist in many parts of\r\nthe world. Women rarely have any role in the decisions\r\nleading to armed conflicts, but they contribute to a large\r\nextent to preserving social order in times of war and\r\narmed conflicts. We believe that women could and should\r\nplay an increased role in conflict resolution, and we\r\nwould particularly welcome more women being appointed\r\nas Special Representatives of the Secretary-General.\r\nThere has been a dramatic growth in the need for\r\nhumanitarian assistance in recent years. The United\r\nNations system, playing a major role in the field of\r\nhumanitarian relief, has been tested almost to breaking\r\npoint by recent crises. Complex emergency situations\r\nhave resulted in increased demands on scarce resources.\r\nThere has been criticism that as a result of concentration\r\non emergency relief, little effort was made to devise\r\nrecovery programmes. The humanitarian community will\r\nhave to play an important role in ensuring the transition\r\nfrom relief to rehabilitation. We should not forget,\r\nhowever, that it has been only four years since\r\nhumanitarian action provided by the United Nations\r\nsystem was given structure and coherence.\r\nAnti-personnel land-mines, with their immensely\r\ndestructive effects on individuals and communities around\r\nthe world, are a humanitarian tragedy. Innocent civilians,\r\nin particular women, children, refugees and displaced\r\npersons, are at greatest risk. Furthermore, mines impede\r\nthe rehabilitation and reconstruction of societies torn by\r\nwar. In keeping with its mandate to develop and promote\r\ninternational humanitarian law, the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has continuously\r\ncalled attention to weapons whose effects threaten to\r\nundermine that law, and we commend the ICRC for its\r\nefforts in that respect. I wish to reiterate our call for a\r\ntotal ban on these deadly weapons.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nWe hope that, during this fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we will be able to strengthen the United\r\nNations, which has been indispensable to the international\r\ncommunity for more than 50 years, and to enhance its\r\ncredibility in the eyes of the peoples whom our\r\nOrganization represents.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Singapore, His Excellency Mr. S. Jayakumar.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): Last year we met in a\r\ncelebratory mood. But after every party comes the sober\r\ndawn, and we now face the sombre reality that the United\r\nNations risks marginalization. Its role in the twenty-first\r\ncentury is not to be taken for granted.\r\nThe sad truth is that today the United Nations plays\r\nlittle or no practical role in the management of the most\r\nimportant political, strategic and economic questions of our\r\ntime. But this was not always the case as we recall: the\r\nUnited Nations played a significant role in easing the pangs\r\nof decolonization. Even at the height of the cold war, the\r\nUnited Nations was not an unimportant instrument through\r\nwhich the super-Powers could manage regional proxy\r\nconflicts and, on occasion, even direct nuclear\r\nconfrontation.\r\nThis contrast with its past should lead us to regard the\r\npresent and future of the United Nations with deep concern.\r\nWe can no longer postpone a critical examination of\r\nfundamental issues. It is for this reason that my delegation\r\nis especially gratified to see Malaysia occupy the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this important\r\nturning point for the future of the United Nations. We in\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nknow Tan Sri Razali Ismail for his commitment and clear\r\nthinking.\r\nI can do no better than echo what you, Mr. President,\r\nsaid about reform in the first plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session; we entirely agree\r\nwith you. The interminable debates about the need for\r\nUnited Nations reform have led to precious little real\r\nreform. These debates have served to conceal and not to\r\nclarify basic issues. An important theme has been the need\r\nfor greater efficiency; we all support that. No one can\r\nseriously argue against more productivity, better\r\nmanagement and less waste. The key question, however, is:\r\nefficient to do what?\r\nWhat kind of United Nations do we really want and\r\nfor what purposes? We all know that the purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations are enshrined in the very first Article of\r\nthe Charter. Nevertheless, the answers are not self-\r\nevident. We all know that the first of the United Nations\r\npurposes is\r\n“To maintain international peace and security”.\r\nBut what does this mean? The more extravagant post-cold\r\nwar hopes for a new Agenda for Peace have proved\r\nillusory. The failure of the United Nations Protection\r\nForce (UNPROFOR) raises troubling questions about the\r\nrole of the United Nations after the cold war. The\r\nessential lesson to be drawn from UNPROFOR’s fate is\r\nnot merely how the Security Council became a political\r\ntheatre to assuage the domestic concerns of some of its\r\nprincipal members; nor is it only the truism that the\r\nUnited Nations could do no more than what its principal\r\nmembers allowed it to do. The real tragedy for the United\r\nNations in Bosnia is that when the major Powers finally\r\ndecided to get serious about what they determined to be\r\na threat to international peace and security, their preferred\r\ninstrument was clearly not the United Nations.\r\nAgain, we all agree that poverty breeds conflict, and\r\nthat the gap between the rich and poor is widening. Yet\r\nthe Agenda for Development has been mired in\r\ntheological arguments about the definition of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Now I do not mean to suggest that clarity\r\nof objectives is unimportant. But the real issues are not\r\nthat complicated, because what the least developed most\r\nurgently need is not intellectual sophistry but help: help\r\nto build the institutions and formulate the policies that\r\nwill allow them to plug into the global economy. The\r\nUnited Nations has not adequately met these challenges.\r\nThe stalemate in reform is not merely because of the\r\ndifficulty of the questions or because of conflicting\r\ninterests. Of course, the issues are thorny and differences\r\nin interests inevitable in any system of sovereign States.\r\nThat is precisely why we need the United Nations, as the\r\nCharter envisages, “to be a centre for harmonizing the\r\nactions of nations”.\r\nWhy then is the United Nations today less able to\r\nperform this vital function? In my view, it is because it\r\nhas been reluctant to adequately confront the implications\r\nof the two most significant developments of our time.\r\nFirst, the end of the cold war and, secondly, the\r\nemergence of a truly global world economy. The\r\nconjunction of these two events is changing the manner\r\nin which States relate to each other in unprecedented and\r\nfundamental ways. Yet these developments are at best\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nonly imperfectly reflected in the United Nations. And any\r\ninternational organization that divorces itself from\r\ninternational realities has no future.\r\nThe most obvious consequence for the United Nations\r\nsince the end of the cold war has been the great increase in\r\nmembership. But the change in the nature of Members has\r\noccasioned less comment. In 1945, small States, which I\r\ndefine as those having a population of 10 million or less,\r\nformed 59 per cent of a United Nations with 51 Members.\r\nHalf a century later, in 1995, small States by the same\r\ndefinition formed the same percentage of a United Nations\r\nof 185 Members. And 23 of the 26 countries — more than\r\n88 per cent — that joined the United Nations after 1989\r\nwere also small States. I expect that when the United\r\nNations membership expands further, as it surely must, the\r\nmajority of new Members will also be small States.\r\nThis is because changes in the structure of the\r\ninternational economy engendered by technological\r\nadvances and the end of the cold war have made size less\r\nimportant in the determination of a country’s viability.\r\nWhat matters most today is not merely the extent of a\r\nState’s frontiers or the wealth of its resources; the key is\r\nthe ability of a State to integrate itself as part of a network,\r\nand size is irrelevant to this.\r\nThe most important international networks are not\r\ncomposed of relations between States. The critical networks\r\nare increasingly defined by transnational patterns of\r\nrelationships between cities, regions and subregions that\r\nmay only imperfectly fit in with the formal political\r\nboundaries of individual States. This again makes a\r\ncountry’s size or its resources less important than its ability\r\nto access these networks.\r\nIt is a fact that many small countries are also among\r\nthe less developed. This is not surprising given the skewed\r\ndistribution of international wealth. But the significant point\r\nis that to be small is no longer an automatic or fatal\r\ndisability. It can even be advantageous. This has\r\nemboldened many to seek self-determination. And since the\r\nsame trends have loosened the ability of capitals to control\r\ntheir peripheries, many have succeeded.\r\nWhere economics leads, politics inevitably follows.\r\nParadoxically, the political consequence of increasing\r\neconomic integration of a globalized world economy is a\r\ncertain loosening of political bonds. We see the effects of\r\nthis most dramatically in the physical breakup of large and\r\ndiverse States. But these are exceptional situations. Even\r\nwhen, as is more usual, the formal political boundaries\r\nremain intact, the ability of capitals of large and relatively\r\nhomogeneous States to impose a single direction over all\r\ntheir constituent parts is clearly diminishing. Power is\r\ndevolving everywhere. This trend is a new international\r\nreality.\r\nI do not wish to overstate the argument. So long as\r\nsovereignty remains the chief organizing principle of the\r\ninternational system, the exercise of force cannot be\r\ndiscounted in inter-State relations. In war, size is not\r\nentirely irrelevant, even though technology has made it\r\nsomething less than the totally decisive factor it was in\r\nthe past. But war is an extreme condition of international\r\nrelations. Under normal conditions, the very notions of\r\npower and wealth are being redefined and becoming more\r\ndiffuse, their different dimensions less prone to be\r\nfocused in just a few world capitals. Hierarchy is still a\r\nfact of international life. But what does it really mean to\r\nbe a “great Power” at the end of the twentieth century?\r\nThe very phrase today sounds anachronistic.\r\nBereft of a simple strategic enemy, the post-cold-war\r\nforeign policy decision-making of the major Powers is\r\nincreasingly localized, with domestic politics exercising\r\ngreater impact. The policies of big Powers in a globalized\r\nworld, where the economic and other interests of their\r\ncomponent parts may be at odds with those of the capital,\r\nis becoming less coherent. The very notion of a single\r\nnational interest is becoming somewhat ambiguous.\r\nAll this is making it increasingly difficult for even\r\nthe biggest countries to routinely bring their power to\r\nbear in an interdependent world, where an attack on an\r\nopponent may well damage their own interests. Wielding\r\npower is becoming more unpredictable even for those\r\nwho control its greatest instruments. It is not an accident\r\nthat the big Powers are now somewhat more cautious\r\nabout exercising power nakedly save in exceptional\r\ncircumstances and against States that are marginal in the\r\nglobal economy.\r\nI do not mean to suggest that the traditional notion\r\nof international relations structured by the interactions of\r\na few big Powers pursuing their individual national\r\ninterests is entirely obsolete. But it is surely an inadequate\r\ndescription of the world today. The balance of military\r\npower is still important. But the strict distinction between\r\nhigh politics and low politics on which the traditional\r\nbalance of power rested is increasingly blurred.\r\nNow, all this ought to make a consultative,\r\nmultilateral process more attractive to everyone, and not\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nless attractive. Alas, this is not so. Herein lies the root of\r\nthe problems of the United Nations. All States, big and\r\nsmall, are adjusting to the changing international system.\r\nIndeed they have no choice. But not all are choosing to do\r\nso in or through the United Nations. In the United Nations,\r\nmost of the Powers that we traditionally designate as\r\n“great” have reacted with varying degrees of disquiet to\r\nthese new international realities.\r\nSome, troubled by their decreasing ability to control\r\nevents even within their own frontiers, are frustrated at their\r\ninability to impose their order on what is perceived as a\r\nrecalcitrant, unfamiliar and intrusive Organization. Others\r\nsee a threat to their position and prestige. Psychological\r\nadjustments are always the most difficult to make. It is thus\r\nnot surprising that in the United Nations their reflex\r\nreaction has generally been a stubborn defence of the status\r\nquo.\r\nIn discussions on United Nations reform, this simple\r\nfact is all too often obscured by the use of arcane and\r\nconvoluted jargon. I am encouraged, Mr. President, by your\r\nreputation for plain speaking, for pulling aside the veil of\r\nrhetoric and letting the truth be known. If the United\r\nNations is to be marginalized, let the responsibility clearly\r\nbe seen to lie where it should. This is most evident in the\r\ntwo most critical and inter-related areas: Security Council\r\nreform and finance.\r\nDiscussions on Security Council reform have\r\nemphasized the Council\u0027s size and composition, and in\r\nparticular the possibility of the admission of new permanent\r\nmembers. There is a wide consensus that in the event that\r\nthere should be agreement for an increase in the permanent\r\nmembership, an increase only by industrialised countries\r\nwould be unacceptable. Many countries agree that Japan\r\nand Germany should become new permanent members\r\nwhen consensus is reached on the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil. Nevertheless, crucial ambiguities remain about\r\nwhether new permanent members should have the veto. It\r\nis especially difficult to imagine major Powers allowing\r\ndeveloping countries the veto over their policies. And\r\ntherefore the stalemate continues.\r\nThere is also widespread agreement that Security\r\nCouncil reform should comprise a comprehensive package\r\nthat would include changes in the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council in the direction of greater transparency\r\nand participation by the membership of the Organization as\r\na whole. But the permanent members have been reluctant\r\nto admit any but the most cosmetic of changes to the\r\nSecurity Council’s working methods. Yet this is the most\r\ncritical aspect of Security Council reform for the small\r\nStates which form the majority of United Nations\r\nMembers. Small countries do not aspire to permanent\r\nmembership. But as the principal organ for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\nSecurity Council’s working methods and its decision-\r\nmaking processes are of vital and legitimate interest to\r\nthem because they can have direct a impact on their\r\nsecurity.\r\nOne of the most important and innovative proposals\r\ncurrently on the table is for a reinterpretation of Article\r\n31 of the Charter. This would allow greater participation\r\nby non-members in informal Security Council\r\nconsultations when questions affecting them are being\r\nconsidered. It was extremely discouraging that this\r\nmodest proposal was categorically rejected by almost\r\nevery permanent member. Indeed, most refused even to\r\nseriously discuss it. It must surely be a basic principle of\r\nelementary justice that parties most directly affected by a\r\nparticular situation should be allowed to present their\r\nviews directly to the body that will have the most\r\ninfluence over any action that the United Nations may\r\ntake on that situation. That is in fact the precise reason\r\nwhy Article 31 was included in the Charter in the first\r\nplace. The intention was clearly to reconcile great-Power\r\nleadership with the principle of sovereign equality.\r\nInformal consultations are an innovation that has\r\nevolved over the years. All the most important decisions\r\nthe Security Council takes today are made informally by\r\npermanent members. Even the participation of non-\r\npermanent members in the real decisions is sometimes\r\nmore symbolic than significant. Formal meetings are\r\nclearly only a choreographed ritual to set the final seal of\r\napproval. A reinterpretation of Article 31 would not\r\nrequire an amendment to the Charter, nor would it mean\r\nthat non-members must participate in all informal\r\nconsultations. It is therefore no real threat to the authority\r\nof the permanent members; it is just an important reform\r\nthat would undoubtedly enhance the legitimacy, and hence\r\nthe general acceptability and effectiveness, of Security\r\nCouncil decision-making by bringing the process more in\r\ntune with the temper of our times.\r\nI do not wish to be misunderstood. I am not\r\nsuggesting that the size and composition of the Security\r\nCouncil are unimportant. I understand the merit of the\r\nclaims for new permanent membership that have been\r\nadvanced by both industrialized and developing countries.\r\nSingapore supports the expansion of the Security Council\r\nby up to five new permanent members as part of a\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\ncomprehensive package that would, among other things,\r\ninclude the consequent adjustment of non-permanent\r\nmembership to maintain a balanced ratio. But given the\r\nprofound changes in international relations that are under\r\nway, refusing to seriously discuss anything but membership,\r\nand even that with critical ambiguities, would be akin to\r\ntrying to prepare the United Nations for the twenty-first\r\ncentury by applying a nineteenth-century model of great-\r\nPower politics to it.\r\nThe same resistance to seriously engaging the\r\nlegitimate interests of the small-State majority of United\r\nNations Members also underlies the financial problems of\r\nthe United Nations. No one disagrees that the key reason\r\nfor the cash flow problems of the United Nations is the\r\nfailure of Member States to pay their dues in full and on\r\ntime.\r\nThere are various reasons why various Member States\r\nhave not met their legal obligations. Some are poor. But no\r\none has ever suggested that the largest debtor lacks the\r\ncapacity to pay. Its argument is that its assessed\r\ncontributions must be reduced because the state of its\r\ndomestic political consensus does not permit it to sustain its\r\ncurrent share of the United Nations budget. The financial\r\nburdens, it is consequently argued, ought therefore be more\r\nwidely spread. I do not lightly dismiss such arguments.\r\nThey reflect the increasing difficulty of defining and\r\nexercising great power that I had earlier called one of the\r\nnew international realities. I can therefore sympathize with\r\nsuch arguments. But it is not politically acceptable to pick\r\nand choose which of the new realities to emphasize when\r\nuseful, and which to ignore when inconvenient.\r\nSeveral permanent members have complained of the\r\nfinancial burdens they bear, and have sought to spread them\r\nmore widely. But there has never been any suggestion by\r\nany of the big Powers that their control over critical United\r\nNations expenditure decisions, in particular peacekeeping\r\nexpenditures, should be proportionately diffused among the\r\nmajority of small countries which would be expected to\r\ntake up the financial slack that they want to discard. All the\r\npermanent members have been reluctant to allow anything\r\nmore than the most superficial reexamination of their\r\nauthority or their relationship with the membership as a\r\nwhole. Discussions on the role of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is the only universal and truly representative United\r\nNations organ, have touched mainly on peripheral issues,\r\nsuch as the timing of plenary meetings, the duration of the\r\ngeneral debate and the organization of the General\r\nAssembly’s work.\r\nNo one should disagree that to put the United\r\nNations on a sound financial basis ought to be a common\r\nendeavour. We certainly do not. But it must really be a\r\ncollective enterprise involving fair give and take. Political\r\nresistance coalesces because it has become clear that the\r\nmajority are expected to give, while the few only take.\r\nResistance is underscored by the historical fact that the\r\npercentage financial contributions of all permanent\r\nmembers, except France, have been steadily reduced over\r\nthe years while their privileges have not. Resistance is\r\nstrengthened by the recollection that the United Nations\r\nhas in fact repeatedly made the financial adjustments\r\nasked for, but as yet without any appreciable change in\r\nthe payment record of the largest contributor.\r\nI do not suggest that this situation is the result of a\r\ndeliberate policy, since no country takes any pleasure in\r\nbeing unable to pay its dues for whatever reason. But it\r\nis politically incongruous and basically unfair to ask the\r\nmajority to assume a greater share of the financial\r\nburdens without at the same time being prepared to allow\r\nthem any more authority over the most important\r\nexpenditure decisions. It is untenable to have an almost\r\ntotal separation between the authority for launching\r\npeacekeeping operations and how and who should pay for\r\nthem. The United Nations is the only organization in\r\nwhich a small number of Members run up the largest bills\r\nwhile everybody else pays them.\r\nThe stubborn defence of the status quo is all the\r\nmore striking because no one has asked for anything more\r\nthan the most modest and incremental adjustments to the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council to allow the general membership a little\r\ngreater participation in and shared responsibility for the\r\ndecision-making with the greatest budgetary implications.\r\nSingapore is, of course, a small State, and I do not\r\nclaim to be a disinterested party. As a small State, we are\r\npassionately concerned about and vitally engaged in the\r\nfuture of the United Nations. However, our drawing\r\nattention to the real obstacles to reform is not just in the\r\ninterests of small countries alone.\r\nI have suggested that the paradoxical political\r\nconsequence of a globalized world economy is a certain\r\nenhancement of centrifugal tendencies everywhere. A\r\nuniversal international organization to play an integrative\r\nrole is therefore needed by everyone, big and small, if\r\nthis is not to lead to conflict. Only the United Nations can\r\nplay this role, and if it did not exist, we would have had\r\nto invent it. But the United Nations can play this\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nintegrative role only if the legitimate aspirations of the\r\nsmall States are not ignored and if the majority do not\r\nbecome increasingly alienated from the very Organization\r\nthat purports to represent them.\r\nSome may dismiss the distance between the rhetoric\r\nand the reality of the big-Power attitude towards United\r\nNations reform as simple hypocrisy. I do not accept such a\r\nsimplistic explanation. I can empathize with the far more\r\ncomplex and wrenching psychological adjustments that the\r\nbig Powers need to make. The big Powers must summon\r\nthe political courage to begin this process and embrace the\r\nreality of, and necessity for, change. I appeal to them to\r\nwork with us, the small-State majority, to make this truly\r\na United Nations for all — all — its Members.\r\nPrestige does not depend solely on privilege, and\r\npower shared is not power lost. The new international\r\nrealities are making a zero-sum conception of State power\r\nobsolete. A credible United Nations, one that is not\r\nregarded as the mere tool of its largest Members, will be a\r\nmore effective instrument for the foreign policies of all its\r\nMembers, big and small.\r\nIn closing, let me say that my delegation looks\r\nforward to close collaboration with you, Sir, and all other\r\nmembers over the next year to advance a collective vision\r\nof a truly representative, effective and united United\r\nNations for the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Netherlands, His Excellency Mr. H.A.F.M.O.\r\nvan Mierlo.\r\nMr. van Mierlo (Netherlands): I join my colleague,\r\nMinister Dick Spring of Ireland, who spoke on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, in congratulating you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. As a\r\nrepresentative with a long and distinguished career in\r\nUnited Nations affairs, you are especially qualified to guide\r\nour work in the coming year.\r\nAs the present century draws to a close, we need to\r\nask ourselves what shape the United Nations is in. Is it\r\nready to face the world that lies ahead? Is it ready to meet\r\nthe needs of generations that are still to be born? The\r\nrealities confronting us today may still be the realities of\r\ntomorrow, and they are formidable. We are witnessing\r\nincreasing poverty, a growing rift between rich and poor,\r\nmigration, population pressure, dwindling food stocks,\r\nhazards to public health and the environment, drugs,\r\nterrorism, internal conflicts and wholesale violations of\r\nhuman rights: a daunting litany.\r\nIn the face of these realities, to argue in favour of\r\nreform of this Organization would be stating the obvious.\r\nOf course we need reform. Clearly, the United Nations,\r\nover the years, has turned into an institutional jungle\r\nwhere outsiders do not venture, an organization which for\r\nthat reason alone has lost much of its credibility and\r\nwhich is badly in need of revitalization. We have to\r\nreform. There is no alternative.\r\nWe need reforms to get back what we have lost; that\r\nis, not power, but authority. Power is wielded on many\r\ndifferent levels, and by some States more than by others.\r\nThere is not very much the United Nations can do to\r\ninfluence Member States to make use of their power, and\r\nthe power of the United Nations itself is rather limited.\r\nBut what the United Nations was given a lot of 51 years\r\nago, was authority: moral authority as well as legal\r\nauthority, the kind of authority that comes with speaking\r\non behalf of the world community, with voicing the\r\npublic conscience and transcending vested interests.\r\nIndeed, if this Organization is to approach the future from\r\na position of strength and of confidence, and if we expect\r\nthe nations of the world to rally behind the flag of the\r\nUnited Nations, its authority needs to be intact. In fact, it\r\nneeds to be growing.\r\nWell, is it growing? Here a sobering note is due. At\r\nthis critical juncture in its history, the United Nations is\r\nseeing its authority, the one commodity it can never have\r\ntoo much of, compromised and weakened; this is also the\r\none commodity it cannot afford to have too little of. I\r\nwould wish to highlight some of the manifestations of\r\nhow the authority of the United Nations is on the wane\r\nand offer some prospects for shoring it up again.\r\nFirst, multilateralism, as such, is under pressure.\r\nMany States no longer regard multilateral cooperation as\r\na separate goal of their foreign policy, but instead as one\r\nof many policy instruments which they can choose to\r\napply or not to apply in accordance with their national\r\ninterests. Alterative sources of international leadership\r\nhave sprung up, and ad hoc coalitions are formed as the\r\nneed arises. The United Nations is regarded more and\r\nmore as a vehicle for safeguarding a nation’s particular\r\ninterests, even in the short term, rather than as the\r\npreferred avenue for solving pressing world-wide\r\nproblems. This shopping-mall attitude towards the United\r\nNations is in stark contrast with the lofty principles the\r\nfounding fathers signed their names to.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nGradual loss of authority is also caused by\r\ndisappointment and frustration. The United Nations was\r\nonce established as an ideal form of international\r\ncooperation. Particularly after the end of the cold war,\r\nexpectations rose as never before. For decades, the world\r\nhad been dominated and the United Nations paralysed by\r\ntwo power blocs at loggerheads. The United Nations could\r\nnow finally begin to play the role originally laid out for it.\r\nUnfortunately, this did not happen. Success stories\r\nsuch as the United Nations involvement in Namibia, in El\r\nSalvador and Mozambique were overshadowed by\r\ndisappointment over the outcome of Missions Impossible\r\nsuch as Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia. That the Member\r\nStates themselves had decided to send the United Nations\r\non those missions could not stem the erosion of authority\r\nthat came with them.\r\nFrustration has mounted over effectiveness and\r\nefficiency, two qualities that have eluded the United\r\nNations for a long time. It would be facile to blame the\r\nlack of them on the Secretariat alone. The grinding manner\r\nin which the intergovernmental machinery of this\r\nOrganization works is a major factor as well.\r\nCriticism abounds. The track record of the United\r\nNations is in many ways impressive, to be sure, and even\r\nmore so when we look at the broad spectrum of the entire\r\nUnited Nations system. Its achievements in the fields of\r\ninternational law, human rights, development, the\r\npopulation crisis, health care, the position of women, labour\r\nconditions and disarmament are just random examples. In\r\nreality, the list is long. Yet somehow United Nations-\r\nbashing has become the craze these days and even a tool of\r\ncampaign rhetoric, or else it serves to distract attention\r\nfrom internal problems. Nevertheless, the United Nations\r\nmoral authority is sapped by the real and the imagined and\r\nby criticism justified or unjustified.\r\nThen there is the financial situation. From the early\r\ndays, payment or non-payment of contributions has been\r\nindicative of the United Nations approval rating. The level\r\nof arrears we are now facing is, however, without\r\nprecedent. Sadly, it is in large part a reflection of declining\r\nconfidence and belief in the Organization’s potential. The\r\npresent financial turmoil is not primarily the cause of the\r\nUnited Nations predicament, but rather a consequence of it,\r\na symptom. Of course, empty coffers will lead to less\r\noutput eventually. Less output would undermine authority\r\neven further. Less authority in turn leads to fewer\r\npayments, which again would exacerbate the financial\r\ncrisis. And so we may see the United Nations caught in a\r\ndownward spiral. The current payment habits of some\r\nMember States amount to a self-fulfilling prophecy.\r\nWorse, they betray the very principles on which the\r\nUnited Nations was founded. The absence of full, prompt\r\nand unconditional payments will further erode the United\r\nNations authority, the same authority those very States\r\nhelped to bestow on the Organization 50 years ago.\r\nIf there is one policy area in which the United\r\nNations has lost much of its authority and stands to loose\r\neven more, it is peace and security. Take Burundi. Today,\r\nthe humanitarian and political situation there is alarming.\r\nWe are witnessing a creeping genocide. Terror prevails.\r\nIn the past few months alone, thousands of innocent men,\r\nwomen and children have lost their lives. An explosion of\r\ngenocide is still a real threat. We cannot allow the\r\noccurrence of another disaster such as that which took\r\nplace in Rwanda in 1994. In that year, we claimed that\r\nwe could hardly have seen it coming. In the case of\r\nBurundi, there will be no such excuse. The writing is\r\nclearly on the wall. If we fail once again and a second\r\ngenocide does take place, the United Nations will suffer\r\nits most dramatic loss of authority ever.\r\nWhat can we do to enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations and hence to help it regain the authority\r\nit needs in order to fulfil its mandate? How can we\r\nreverse the downward spiral?\r\nIf the United Nations is to be effective, the various\r\ninstruments at the disposal of the international community\r\nhave to be used in an integrated manner. This holds true\r\nparticularly in the area of peace and security. In this area,\r\npolitical, military, socio-economic, electoral and\r\nhumanitarian assistance, as well as reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment, will have to be applied in harmony. Hence,\r\nan integrated approach is the only way effectively to\r\nprevent and combat conflicts. The United Nations needs\r\nto be on the ground when it matters and where it matters.\r\nThis is the lesson that can be drawn from recent crises in\r\nAfrica — such as in Rwanda and Somalia — where the\r\ninternational response to tragic violence became\r\nineffective through lack of coherence.\r\nPreventive diplomacy, on the one hand, and post-\r\nconflict peace-building, on the other, require increased\r\nattention. More than ever, the United Nations should\r\nfocus on the prevention of conflicts and, when conflicts\r\ndo occur nevertheless, on defusing them at an early stage.\r\nWhen I addressed this Assembly two years ago, I\r\ndrew attention to the United Nations capability, or rather\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nthe lack of it, to respond adequately and in a timely manner\r\nto acute situations of conflict. Some progress has been\r\nmade since then — progress in the form of modest\r\nintermediate steps that would in the longer run lead to a\r\nUnited Nations better equipped to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity. Today, there is a growing number of countries that\r\ntake part in the United Nations standby-arrangements\r\nsystem and in the efforts of a group of nations to establish\r\na United Nations high-readiness brigade under this system.\r\nThe transparency of the Security Council’s decision-making\r\nconcerning peace-operations has improved. A rapidly\r\ndeployable headquarters will soon be added to the United\r\nNations peace-keeping capacity.\r\nThe future of conflict prevention is linked to the\r\nUnited Nations power to combat yet another threat to its\r\nauthority: impunity. Does the world community actually\r\nhave sufficient means to bring to justice those guilty of war\r\ncrimes or crimes against humanity? As the cases of Burundi\r\nand Liberia sadly illustrate, the prospect of impunity\r\nprovides an open invitation to commit crimes without fear\r\nof retribution and stands in the way of future reconciliation\r\nand reconstruction. The Tribunals on the former Yugoslavia\r\nand on Rwanda represent the single most important\r\nendeavour of the international community since Nuremberg\r\nto adjudicate war crimes and crimes against humanity. We\r\ncannot let it fail. Yet the Yugoslavia Tribunal will face a\r\nserious problem so long as it cannot gain custody of more\r\nof the many people it has indicted. Soon, the present\r\ncircumstances will erode its authority and, indeed, that of\r\nthe United Nations as a whole.\r\nMy country feels that the establishment of ad hoc\r\nTribunals once again underlines the need for the speedy\r\ncreation of a permanent international criminal court. Once\r\nthis Court has been established, it will become even more\r\nimperative that those accused of such crimes actually be\r\nbrought to trial. The United Nations should enhance its\r\ncapacity to ensure the apprehension, extradition and trial of\r\nthose so accused.\r\nIf there is one area of the United Nations where moral\r\nand legal authority play crucial roles, it is that of human\r\nrights. Here, the record of the Organization is impressive,\r\nbut still more can and should be done and new challenges\r\nlie in store.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIncreased attention for human rights will increase the\r\nmoral authority of the United Nations. In this regard, its\r\nauthority should rest firmly on the Universal Declaration,\r\nadopted by this Organization in 1948\r\n“as a common standard of achievement for all\r\npeoples and all nations” (resolution 217 A (III),\r\neighth preambular para.) —\r\nin other words, a universal framework. Forty-five years\r\nlater, in Vienna, the universality of human rights was\r\nonce again expounded by the United Nations membership\r\nas we know it today.\r\nYet, universality of human rights is under pressure.\r\nEver since Vienna, the discussion of what is called\r\ncultural particularities seems to have chipped away at it.\r\nSome Governments claim that their nation’s human-rights\r\nperformance cannot be held up to the same standards as\r\nother nations’ due to differences in their historical,\r\ncultural and religious backgrounds.\r\nLet us make no mistake. There are differences in the\r\nway people look at human rights in the various regions of\r\nthe world and the ongoing dialogue in the United Nations\r\nwould be ill-served if we chose to deny that there were\r\nany differences at all. True, religious and ethical values,\r\ncultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions should\r\nbe borne in mind at all times and, by themselves, are\r\neven protected by the Universal Declaration. But their\r\nlink to human rights as such and to the concept of\r\nuniversality is a very particular one. The international\r\ncommunity has expressed it nowhere more accurately than\r\nin the Platform for Action adopted in Beijing one year\r\nago. As we agreed in Beijing, rather than detracting from\r\nthe ambit of universality, cultural differences should\r\ncontribute to the full enjoyment of human rights. The\r\nStates Members of this Organization agreed in Vienna\r\nthat, regardless of their political, economic and cultural\r\nsystems, it is their duty to promote and protect all human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nIncreased emphasis calls for more financial\r\nresources. A larger part of the United Nations budget\r\nshould be devoted to human rights. This, in turn, will\r\nenhance the moral authority of the Organization in the\r\neyes of the multitudes who are still deprived of their\r\nhuman rights today. Letting the programme wither away\r\nwill produce the opposite effect.\r\nThe General Assembly, being the only plenary organ\r\nof the United Nations, is the most conspicuous.\r\nCredibility and authority are very much tied to the\r\nAssembly’s performance. Sadly, this body sees many of\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nits resolutions ignored. We should vigorously seek to infuse\r\nnew vitality into the Assembly’s proceedings and in the\r\nrelevance of its achievements.\r\nTwo weeks ago, the Assembly effectively lived up to\r\nits responsibility by adopting the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty by an overwhelming majority. The\r\nadoption of the Treaty by this world body lends authority\r\nto the new norm outlawing nuclear testing. My country\r\nfeels privileged that it was called upon to preside over the\r\nnegotiations. Adoption of the Treaty contributes to the\r\nultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons, a goal to which\r\nmy country remains fully committed. We aim for a\r\npropitious entry into force. But even in the absence of entry\r\ninto force, the authority of the United Nations will make it\r\nmore difficult for any State to act against the Treaty.\r\nIncreased attention should be given to those activities\r\nof the United Nations which are not of a strictly political\r\nnature or concerned with security, namely, the socio-\r\neconomic aspects and the strengthening of those parts of\r\nthe United Nations system dealing with such matters as\r\npoverty, population, food security, urbanization, equality of\r\nwomen and the environment. These areas are crucial for the\r\nfuture of the world and for the quality of life on this planet.\r\nThese are also areas where the Organization is especially\r\nqualified to identify and debate the problems and where it\r\nhas set up an impressive array of operational activities. A\r\nseries of world conferences in recent years has helped to\r\nupgrade the authority of the United Nations system. They\r\nhave set an agenda for the United Nations and the Member\r\nStates to follow during the coming decades. The World\r\nFood Summit in November should do the same. The\r\nSummit faces the awesome problem of a world that may\r\nhave to feed 10 billion people by the time the United\r\nNations is 100 years old.\r\nThere is, of course, a risk that expectations have been\r\nraised too high once more and that disappointment will lead\r\nonce more to loss of authority. The United Nations and its\r\nMember States have to make sure this does not happen.\r\nThe United Nations will play a major role in the fields of\r\nadvocacy, coordination and monitoring. Although the\r\nUnited Nations itself contributes to implementation through\r\nits field operations, the Member States bear the primary\r\nresponsibility for full implementation at the national level.\r\nTogether, they can succeed in ensuring that the world\r\ncommunity reaches the goals it has set for itself.\r\nThe authority of the United Nations is at stake. It will\r\nnot disappear in a clap of thunder. It will die with a\r\nwhimper. It stands to fade away gradually, without at any\r\ntime making alarm bells ring, and with it, the\r\nOrganization may well slide into the margins of the world\r\nscene. The United Nations needs a new sense of direction\r\nand purpose to become, once again, a beacon for mankind\r\nas intended by the authors of the Charter. That requires a\r\nsustained effort of all Members of this Organization.\r\nThere is little time left. Let us use it well.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the First\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Kuwait, His Excellency Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-\r\nJaber Al-Sabah.\r\nMr. Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): On behalf of the State of Kuwait, it gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to extend to Mr. Razali our sincere\r\ncongratulations on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nGiven his personal experience and wisdom, we\r\nbelieve that he will be able to guide our discussions\r\nefficiently towards a successful conclusion. Since he\r\nrepresents a sister Muslim country, I am particularly\r\npleased to take this opportunity to underscore the firm\r\nbonds of brotherhood in Islam between Malaysia and\r\nKuwait.\r\nI am pleased to use this occasion also, to pay tribute\r\nto the President of the previous session of the Assembly\r\nfor his outstanding efforts and contributions during that\r\nhistoric session.\r\nKuwait views with pride and acknowledgement the\r\nimpressive performance of the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, especially his\r\nleading role in and commitment to the enhancement of\r\nthe functioning of the world Organization in the areas of\r\nglobal peace, security and development. Mr. Boutros-\r\nGhali has consistently worked to restructure the United\r\nNations to bring it more into line with the aspirations and\r\nexpectations attached to it. I want to make special\r\nmention of the concrete steps the Secretary-General has\r\ntaken to curb and rationalize expenditures, to streamline\r\nthe administrative structure, and to reorganize the\r\nSecretariat in order to reflect current realities in the global\r\narena. Hence, Kuwait subscribes to the position adopted\r\nby the League of Arab States and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in supporting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s bid to remain on board in order to pursue his\r\nreform programme for the revitalization of the United\r\nNations.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nLast year, the family of nations observed the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations\r\nagainst a backdrop of universal recognition of the\r\nwonderful achievements of the United Nations system. The\r\nrecord includes, to cite only a few areas: assistance in the\r\nattainment of national independence by many States; the\r\nestablishment of the principles contained in the Charter,\r\nincluding the right to self-determination; the consolidation\r\nof codes of civilized conduct among States; the upholding\r\nof justice and equality; and the promotion of economic and\r\nsocial development. Perhaps the most shining success of the\r\nUnited Nations is the peacekeeping operations it carries out\r\nin many volatile regions of the world. Such operations have\r\nrecently assumed a new humanitarian dimension in the\r\nform of relief efforts in cases of natural disasters and civil\r\nwar, and election monitoring.\r\nWe view the United Nations as a forum for debating\r\nthe future of humankind among nations, with a view to\r\npromoting the well-being, dignity and basic freedoms of the\r\nhuman person. The ever-increasing complexity of\r\ncontemporary life in this global village and the ever-\r\nchanging set of common and pressing issues which continue\r\nto emerge require a concerted international effort through\r\nthe United Nations. By the same token, we must admit that\r\nthere are gargantuan challenges that continue to face the\r\nUnited Nations, most poignantly the ethnic and regional\r\nconflicts that endanger regional stability and the\r\ninternational security system. Other pressing issues include\r\nthe population explosion, environmental degradation, the\r\nwater shortage, desertification, the food deficit, the growing\r\ngap between the North and the South, the regional arms\r\nrace, the threat posed by nuclear weapons, the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, development concerns,\r\nbarriers to economic and trade cooperation, the removal of\r\nrestrictions on free trade and, last but not least, human\r\nrights.\r\nTo rally all States members of the world community\r\nround ways to deal with the fundamental transformations\r\nthat face the world, we must: believe in the energy,\r\npotential and mechanisms of the United nations system to\r\nbe able to address global concerns in a multilateral fashion;\r\nprovide enthusiastic financial, political and moral support\r\nfor the United Nations and identify with its principles and\r\npurposes; fully pay assessed contributions to the United\r\nNations budget; and actively pursue a genuinely peaceful\r\npolicy that recognizes and respects the rights and legitimate\r\nconcerns of other Member States, with a view to building\r\nup a regional order in line with the norms of international\r\nbehaviour. Accordingly, regional arrangements should be\r\nanchored in the established codes of justice and rules of\r\ninternational law and treaties. Here we must ensure\r\nrespect for human rights, and protect human dignity and\r\nthe freedom of choice. In this context, human\r\ndevelopment without discrimination is essential for the\r\noverall economic and social development of society. Top\r\npriority should be given to this goal rather than to\r\nsquandering national resources on weaponry. We must\r\nface up to terrorism and muster the national will to work\r\ncollectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes\r\nof this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong,\r\nthe poor and the rich, for, in the final analysis, terrorism\r\nis not susceptible to reason; it stems from bigotry,\r\ntraumatizes the innocent, resorts to violence and seeks no\r\ndialogue.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the indisputable fact remains\r\nthat today’s world is interdependent in its security as well\r\nas in its general concerns. The affluent few may not be\r\nable to live in exclusive comfort while a majority of\r\nhumankind is marginalized in deprivation and poverty.\r\nHere emerges the stark need for a collective conceptual\r\nand material effort to develop a common agenda for the\r\nbenefit of all human beings.\r\nIt is from this perspective that we view the\r\nsignificance of the revitalization and refashioning of\r\nUnited Nations organs to keep abreast of the rapid\r\ndevelopment of international relations. In this context,\r\nKuwait is following closely the ongoing discussions in the\r\nOpen-Ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. We had hoped that consensus would\r\nhave been reached on the restructuring and reform of the\r\nSecurity Council to coincide with the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year.\r\nFailure to attain that goal so far should not dampen our\r\nhopes. Rather, we should redouble our efforts towards\r\nthat end. Our aim should be a Security Council whose\r\nwork and procedures are more transparent. Its resolutions\r\nshould reflect more faithfully the will of the universal\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Its composition should\r\nbe expanded to reflect the recent increase in membership,\r\nsovereign equality among States and the equitable\r\ngeographical distribution of seats among the various\r\nregional groups.\r\nAny reform of the Security Council must in the end\r\nensure collective efforts by both members of the Council\r\nand other members of the international community to\r\nrespect and implement its resolutions. The Council should\r\nbe able to demonstrate its firm resolve against any regime\r\nthat does not comply with Council resolutions.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nA textbook case in point is the just position towards\r\nthe Iraqi regime adopted by the Council and supported by\r\nthe international community as a whole. As recently as\r\n23 June 1996, leaders of Arab States, in the final statement\r\nissued at the end of the extraordinary Arab Summit in\r\nCairo, urged the Iraqi Government:\r\n“not to embark on any aggressive policies aimed at\r\nprovoking its Arab neighbours and to implement in\r\nfull all the relevant Security Council resolutions and\r\nespecially those requiring it to take the necessary\r\nmeasures to release all Kuwaiti and third-country\r\nprisoners and detainees, to return the property seized\r\nand to comply with the compensation mechanism.\r\nThey regard this as the right way to ensure that the\r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq are lifted and the\r\nappropriate conditions created for Iraq to resume its\r\nrole in the inter-Arab regional order.” (A/50/986,\r\nappendix, p. 7)\r\nThis statement shows a recognition by the Arab\r\nleaders of the nature of the Iraqi regime and their\r\nappreciation for the importance of the full implementation\r\nof all relevant Security Council resolutions. Hence, Iraq\r\nmust cooperate sincerely with the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross in order to account for all Kuwaiti and\r\nthird-country prisoners and detainees, so that the chapter on\r\nthis human tragedy can be closed. We must note with regret\r\nhere that the Tripartite Commission, which meets every\r\nthree months in Geneva, and its Technical Subcommittee,\r\nwhich meets monthly on issues relating to the border\r\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait, have so far gotten nowhere. In\r\npoint of fact, the Iraqi regime exploits such meetings for\r\npropaganda purposes.\r\nI must reiterate here that this question of prisoners and\r\nhostages remains a human tragedy precipitated by the Iraqi\r\nregime. And it remains a top-priority humanitarian issue for\r\nthe people and Government of Kuwait.\r\nThe Iraqi regime is legally bound to cooperate with\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in\r\neliminating its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nUNSCOM\u0027s bitter experience shows that the Iraqi regime\r\nwill not pass up any opportunity to use it for deception,\r\nmisinformation and the concealment of required data. It\r\neven went so far as to block repeatedly the work of\r\nUNSCOM inspectors as recently as March, June and\r\nAugust of this year, thus prompting the Security Council to\r\nadopt resolution 1060 (1996) in addition to presidential\r\nstatements issued by way of warning to the Iraqi regime.\r\nKuwait, keen as it is on ensuring the safety and\r\nstability of the region, supports UNSCOM efforts. Indeed,\r\nwe commend UNSCOM for its resolve and its insistence\r\non the absolute necessity of implementing all provisions\r\nrelating to the liquidation of Iraq’s weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nGiven the human suffering of the brotherly people of\r\nIraq emanating from the policies of the ruling regime,\r\nKuwait continues to provide humanitarian relief assistance\r\nin kind to the Iraqi refugees. We also welcomed the\r\naccord reached between Iraq and the United Nations on\r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 986\r\n(1995) as a step forward towards alleviating the suffering\r\nof the Iraqi people.\r\nLet me take this occasion to reiterate Kuwait’s\r\nposition that Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity must be\r\npreserved. In the meantime, we understand — indeed\r\nappreciate — all measures taken by the Coalition States\r\nin order to ensure the full implementation by Iraq of all\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. The essence and\r\nthrust of these resolutions is the evolution of a regional\r\norder anchored in the established principles of justice and\r\nstability, the rule of law, observance of the norms of\r\ninternational behaviour, and respect for international\r\ntreaties, at the core of which is the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn view of Kuwait’s concern for peace and security\r\nin the Arabian Gulf region, and by virtue of our close\r\nrelations with our sister State, the United Arab Emirates,\r\nand with our friendly neighbour, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Kuwait associates itself with the position of the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council (GCC) regarding the issue of the\r\nislands. Kuwait calls upon the two parties to continue\r\ntheir negotiations in a bid to reach a just and peaceful\r\nsettlement through dialogue.\r\nOn another regional matter, Kuwait fully supports\r\nthe sister State of Bahrain in the recent measures it took\r\nto combat terrorism with a view to consolidating its\r\nsecurity and stability. Our position is in harmony with the\r\nprinciple that the GCC member States have a common\r\ndestiny, and their security and stability are therefore\r\nindivisible.\r\nKuwait has been following with grave concern the\r\nstalling of the Middle East peace process following the\r\nelection of a new Government in Israel, which adopted a\r\nseries of positions that contradict the arrangements\r\nworked out in Madrid, primarily the land-for-peace\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nformula and the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) towards a\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe recent Cairo summit document underscored the\r\nadherence by the Arab States to the peace process, in order\r\nto achieve the ultimate goal of a just and comprehensive\r\npeace, as a strategic option under the umbrella of\r\ninternational law. The Arab position requires a matching\r\ncommitment by Israel to work in a sincere and forthright\r\nfashion all the way through until the overall peace process\r\nis completed. This must include the restoration of rights and\r\nthe return of occupied territories, as well as ensuring\r\nsecurity and a strategic balance of all States of the region,\r\nin accordance with the principles laid down in Madrid.\r\nFor the record, let me recall in this context that\r\nKuwait put the question of Palestine among its top\r\nconcerns. In point of fact, that issue has been central to our\r\nrelations with other members of the international\r\ncommunity. We have channelled enormous effort and\r\nresources into this cause, since Kuwait has always believed\r\nthat Israel has not recognized the legitimate rights of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination and statehood — let\r\nalone the fact that it has seized Palestinian territory in total\r\ndisregard of United Nations resolutions and by using force\r\nas a means of imposing faits accomplis. We demand that\r\nthe Israeli Government stop its settlement activities in the\r\nPalestinian territories, especially in the Holy City of\r\nJerusalem, and that it cease forthwith all changes to its\r\nArab character and legal status. The refugee problem must\r\nalso be resolved according to United Nations resolutions.\r\nFinally, a Palestinian state must be established with\r\nJerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the will of the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nIn this context, we condemn the steps taken by Israel\r\nin commissioning and excavating a tunnel under the\r\nwestern wall of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This constitutes a\r\ndesecration of that holy site and is a provocation to the\r\npeople of Palestine — indeed to all Arabs and Muslims\r\nthroughout the world. The use of great force and violence\r\nby Israel has left many people dead or wounded. We\r\ndemand that Israel put an immediate end to these practices\r\nand that it fulfil its obligations to preserve the Arabic and\r\nIslamic character of these holy places.\r\nLasting and comprehensive peace requires mutual\r\naccommodation of the parties’ rights, compliance with\r\naccords concluded, action in good faith, avoidance of\r\nprovocative acts, and long-term vision — all with a view\r\nnot to inflict injury on any major party to the peace\r\nequation.\r\nWithdrawal by Israel from the Golan is a litmus test\r\nof its good intentions to achieve a just and balanced\r\npeace. Therefore, Kuwait supports Syria’s position that\r\nnegotiations should resume from the point at which they\r\nceased, in view of the fact that the peace process is a\r\ncontinuum that should not stop before reaching its\r\nultimate destination.\r\nKuwait also supports Lebanon in its legitimate\r\ninsistence that Israel must fulfil all provisions of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978), under which Israel must\r\nwithdraw fully and unconditionally from all Lebanese\r\nterritory under occupation.\r\nWe believe that, in the final analysis, world peace is\r\nindivisible and that consequently, the question of global\r\nsecurity has worldwide ramifications. Hence we think that\r\nthe issues of ethnic strife and civil war should remain on\r\nthe international agenda. Thus, we welcome the peaceful\r\nmeasures taken thus far in the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina with a view to bringing that tragedy to an\r\nend while ensuring that the people of that Republic are\r\naccorded their legitimate rights. We also welcome the\r\noutcome of the recently held elections there and\r\ncongratulate President Alija Izetbegović on the well-\r\ndeserved confidence placed in him.\r\nWe also call upon the international community to\r\npursue its efforts towards ending the current tragedies that\r\nafflict Somalia, Afghanistan and Burundi. In the same\r\nvein, we hope that the peoples of those countries will be\r\nresponsive to the efforts of the international community.\r\nKuwait notes with satisfaction the success of the\r\nUnited Nations earlier this month in the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which\r\nis the culmination of a long-standing universal effort and\r\nof hopes for a safer world. Indeed, the CTBT represents\r\nan essential step forward on the path towards the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nCooperation among member States of the\r\ninternational community in the economic and trade\r\nspheres has engendered a welcome openness following\r\nthe conclusion of the world free trade agreement. We\r\nhope that this accord will expand the volume of the\r\ndeveloping countries’ exports to the world markets.\r\nKuwait was in the vanguard of advocating the removal of\r\ntrade barriers simply because we believe that, in the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\ncontext of an interdependent globe, collective political\r\nsecurity cannot be isolated from the economic concerns of\r\nnations. Against this background, we welcome the steps\r\nalready taken by some developing countries to readjust their\r\neconomic approaches towards genuine openness and the\r\nadoption of free-market policies. In our view, this type of\r\nrestructuring will help attract foreign investments and\r\naccelerate the transfer of technology, which, in the end, will\r\nfoster international economic relations in terms of\r\ngenerating a freer cash flow, a better investment\r\nenvironment and an increase in joint ventures.\r\nKuwait believes in the need to harness human energies\r\nto narrow the gaps that exist among nations, based on a\r\ncommon understanding of the tenets that underpin world\r\nsecurity and economic well-being. We also believe that\r\ndialogue and the tolerant exchange of views, coupled with\r\nsincere and determined joint action, will lay a solid\r\nfoundation for improved international relations. Under this\r\nscenario, the good forces will combine to neutralize the evil\r\nones; the “haves” and the “have-nots” might stand a better\r\nchance of interacting beneficially; reason and prudence will\r\nreign supreme, while the outlaws, saboteurs and vicious\r\ntyrants will continue to lose ground. In the end, living\r\nconditions will improve under a new world order based on\r\nthe principles of justice, which promote peace and security\r\nfor all.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nTurkmenistan, His Excellency Mr. Boris Shihmuradov.\r\nMr. Shihmuradov (Turkmenistan): Allow me, first of\r\nall, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail, as a representative of\r\na State with which Turkmenistan has exceptionally warm\r\nrelations, on the occasion of his election to this high post.\r\nI should like also to express confidence that his vast\r\ndiplomatic experience in close association with the United\r\nNations will enable him to effectively guide the work of the\r\ncurrent session, which is called upon to accomplish a\r\nnumber of historic objectives.\r\nThe President\u0027s opening statement reaffirms that our\r\nexpectations will come true. Here, I should like to express\r\nour appreciation to Mr. Freitas do Amaral for his work\r\nduring the preceding session of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich has become an integral part of Turkmenistan’s\r\nhistory by dint of its unanimous adoption of the resolution\r\non the permanent neutrality of my country. Speaking from\r\nthis rostrum on the eve of the adoption of that resolution,\r\nHis Excellency Saparmurad Niyazov, President of\r\nTurkmenistan, emphasized that Turkmenistan would take all\r\nthe necessary steps to reaffirm its complete adherence to\r\nthe principles of the United Nations by making a\r\nconstructive contribution to the stabilization of the\r\nsituation in our strife-torn region, by peace-building and\r\nby serving the interests of cooperation within our region\r\nand at the inter-regional level. During the past year,\r\nTurkmenistan has taken steps to achieve this goal by\r\nplaying host to three rounds of talks between Tajik\r\nfactions in Ashgabat, by providing assistance to the\r\nMission of the Secretary-General’s special envoy for\r\nAfghanistan, and by hosting a number of major\r\ninternational forums.\r\nHaving entered the world community of nations as\r\nan independent State on the eve of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, Turkmenistan, like other countries, has found\r\nitself facing the need to accept the challenge of the times\r\nso typical of the turn of centuries. That is why we have\r\nfocused our efforts on the international arena, striving to\r\nbecome part of the worldwide process with its new trends\r\ntowards unity based on national statehood and\r\nsovereignty. A policy of constructive neutrality has\r\nbecome our response to the challenge of the epoch.\r\nTurkmenistan is an Asian country whose destiny has\r\nbeen to become one of the actors involved in the all-\r\nEuropean process. We view this factor as a unique chance\r\nto cooperate with the Europeans within the framework of\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the European Union and other organizations, and\r\nto promote better understanding and the improvement of\r\nNorth-South cooperation.\r\nToday the international community confronts\r\nproblems requiring new approaches and innovative\r\ndecisions, profound analysis and forecasting. In this\r\nrespect, we would like to propose that, under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations, an international centre for political\r\nstudies be established in Turkmenistan that would carry\r\nout studies on the political and economic situation in our\r\nregion. The work of the centre should correspond to the\r\nnew geopolitical realities, and the centre should have the\r\ntask of elaborating specific strategic recommendations in\r\nthe interests of global peace and security. It is no secret\r\nthat analysing a situation from a distance often leads to\r\nincorrect conclusions and projections.\r\nConfrontation between blocs has become a thing of\r\nthe past. Today geo-economic regions have emerged as\r\nthe main actors in the political arena. Classifying States\r\naccording to their size and might, which infringes on the\r\ninterests of small and medium-size States, has become\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nobsolete. Within the existing system of international\r\nrelations, all States should be able to structure themselves\r\nwithin the framework of universally accepted rules, but they\r\nshould do so according to their own tenets and principles.\r\nIt is in this context that we support the initiatives aimed at\r\nintroducing appropriate changes in the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations, its bodies and sister organizations.\r\nThe United Nations Charter stipulates that the Security\r\nCouncil bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We share the view that\r\ntoday the notion of security has undergone a radical\r\ntransformation and includes an entire set of equally\r\nimportant political, economic, environmental, social,\r\nmilitary and other components. Proceeding from this\r\nassumption, we endorse the proposal that membership of\r\nthis main body of the United Nations should be enlarged,\r\nwithin reasonable limits, so that it may ensure that this\r\ninternational process is manageable and controllable. Of\r\nequal importance is the question of balanced and adequate\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council of States from both\r\nthe North and the South.\r\nToday’s Turkmenistan is a country with a transitional\r\neconomy undergoing profound social and political changes.\r\nIn this respect, we hope that “An Agenda for Development”\r\nwill be finalized during the current session, which will help\r\nto establish a system of priorities and assistance to States\r\npursuing such national development programmes. It is\r\nhardly possible to overestimate the role of the United\r\nNations, because it is precisely this mechanism that should\r\nensure the utmost objectivity and tolerance towards such\r\nprocesses. Newly independent States did not emerge out of\r\na vacuum. Each one possesses its own specific features,\r\nunique national and geographic characteristics, historical\r\nties and psychological patterns. Each one has the right to\r\nchoose its own model of development and State system.\r\nProceeding from this assumption, we support the view\r\nthat diversity is integral to the world. However, though all\r\nStates are subject to international law, the aspirations of all\r\nfor development and prosperity cannot be programmed\r\naccording to a single standard or world view. The main\r\nchallenge of the twenty-first century is to ensure that all\r\nMembers of the United Nations can look at one another\r\nfrom the point of view of unity in diversity. We are\r\ntherefore grateful to the United Nations and to States\r\npossessing global political and economic potential for their\r\nsupport and understanding.\r\nTurkmenistan possesses colossal natural resources. It\r\nhas one of the richest deposits of hydrocarbons in the\r\nworld — I refer to the Caspian basin as well as to other\r\nareas of my country. One of the major tasks facing us is\r\nthe establishment of a pipeline infrastructure that, in\r\nconjunction with the existing system, will ensure supply\r\nof our gas to Europe and Asia. We are glad that\r\nTurkmenistan’s interests as an exporter coincide with the\r\ninterests of European and Asian consumers. We are happy\r\nthat neighbouring countries — Iran, Afghanistan, Russia,\r\nTurkey, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakstan — do not\r\nhave any differences with respect to this issue.\r\nIn this context I would like to touch on several\r\nissues relating to the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan, like all\r\nlittoral States, is concerned about its future and the\r\nprospects for its resources. We believe that there is no\r\nplace for unilateral decisions or dictates on this issue.\r\nWhat is required is the establishment of a system of full\r\ntrust and interaction among the Caspian Sea States for the\r\nsake of the common interests and prosperity of each\r\nindividual State. The forthcoming Conference of Foreign\r\nMinisters of the Caspian States to be held in Ashgabat\r\nwill serve as the forum for discussion of all those\r\nproblems and will prepare a platform for a Caspian\r\nsummit meeting.\r\nTurkmenistan is opposed to any military activity in\r\nthe Caspian Sea. It wishes to ensure a regime of free\r\nnavigation with respect to the national borders of every\r\nlittoral State. The wealth of the Caspian Sea, its unique\r\nbiological and mineral structure and fragile ecological\r\nsystem call for a comprehensive and balanced approach,\r\nfree from short-term profit or political advantage. We do\r\nnot doubt that all Caspian Sea States will be able to find\r\nthe best alternative on the basis of common sense and\r\nrespect for the interests of each country involved in the\r\nname of the common goal of peace and security.\r\nThere is one area of cooperation with the United\r\nNations in which Turkmenistan has a special interest: the\r\nstruggle against drug distribution and trafficking.\r\nTurkmenistan is waging a relentless fight against this evil\r\nand has established a State coordination commission. At\r\nthe beginning of this year Turkmenistan joined the 1961\r\nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971\r\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1988\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in\r\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.\r\nTurkmenistan attaches great importance to its cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme, and has signed a bilateral agreement with it.\r\nIn May 1996 Turkmenistan, together with other countries\r\nof Central Asia, and in cooperation with the United\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme, signed a\r\nmemorandum on regional cooperation concerning control of\r\nillegal production, trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs.\r\nWe need to make extraordinary efforts in order to control\r\nthe situation, roll back the spiral of evil and reverse the\r\nsituation whereby the problem of drugs grows in proportion\r\nto the efforts made to combat it.\r\nTurkmenistan is actively cooperating with the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and the United Nations in developing democratic\r\nprocesses so as to bring up new generations free from the\r\nold psychological stereotypes and doubtful ideological\r\nvalues. Democracy, human rights, people’s rights to\r\nproperty and legal protection are all universal notions.\r\nHowever, it is not enough simply to understand their\r\nrelevance; it is necessary to implement them in real life\r\nonce and for all. What we need is patience and time to\r\nallow such understanding to be translated into practical\r\nreality. That is why Turkmenistan has created an institute\r\nfor democracy, human rights and statehood development,\r\nwhich is called upon to develop its own model of a\r\ndemocratic society, relying on the best European and Asian\r\nexperiences and drawing on the knowledge of international\r\nexperts. One does not have to be a specialist in order to\r\nunderstand that, no matter how perfect a model proposed\r\nfrom outside may seem, it might not be effective when\r\napplied to a traditional Oriental society such as exists in\r\nTurkmenistan, a country that has inherited values from\r\nancient civilizations and the culture of Islam. There is also\r\na specific mentality among its people, who have for\r\ncenturies fought for their survival and have eventually\r\nacquired the chance to be independent and have their own\r\nnational identity.\r\nThe agenda of the current session includes an item\r\ndealing with the development of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and its bodies and the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (ECO). During the last summit of\r\nthat organization, which was held in May 1996 in the\r\ncapital of Turkmenistan, my country assumed the\r\npresidency for the next two-year period, and it intends to\r\nexert every effort necessary to implement the large-scale\r\nprogrammes of this organization, which now comprises 10\r\ncountries.\r\nThe ECO is a purely economic organization with no\r\npolitical strings attached. It members share a common view\r\non this matter. Similarly, we believe that only the\r\nacceleration of economic development and the improvement\r\nof cooperation among States can bring well-being and\r\nprosperity to the peoples of the region. However, a number\r\nof political preconditions are indispensable for developing\r\neconomic interaction so that it can be effective and\r\nfruitful. I believe that a climate of political trust is the\r\nfirst requirement. If such a climate becomes a constant\r\nfactor in our relations, it will contribute to the\r\nadvancement of new, bold initiatives and specific projects.\r\nTo put it plainly, we must profess a philosophy of mutual\r\nunderstanding and trust. It is only under such conditions\r\nthat our projects can be successfully implemented. That\r\nis especially important because conflict situations persist\r\nin the ECO region, in Tajikistan and Afghanistan.\r\nTurkmenistan firmly believes that these two ancient and\r\nwise peoples are capable of overcoming the syndrome of\r\nlingering mistrust and difference. We fully support the\r\ninitiative of the United Nations and the efforts of\r\nneighbouring countries aimed at a peaceful settlement.\r\nAs for Afghanistan, we consider it important that the\r\nconflict there has moved from being in a category of\r\nforgotten conflicts to the centre of international efforts.\r\nBy conducting constant consultations with the leaders of\r\nneighbouring countries and the Secretary-General, the\r\nPresident of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, has\r\nexpressed Turkmenistan’s readiness to take an active part\r\nin the search for an Afghan settlement. The fate of many\r\nglobal economic projects hinges on peace in Afghanistan,\r\nin particular the supply of energy resources to actively\r\ndeveloping energy markets in Asia.\r\nNext month Turkmenistan will celebrate the fifth\r\nanniversary of its independence. Today we can discern\r\nmore clearly the perspectives and understand better in\r\nwhat areas we should develop cooperation with foreign\r\npartners. We can clearly see and evaluate the situation at\r\nhome, in the region and the rest of the world.\r\nAccumulated experience enables us to say that\r\nTurkmenistan has found its place in the international\r\ncommunity, both politically and economically. By\r\nconsistently and progressively\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 26 September 1996\r\nmoving towards the democratization of our society and the\r\nestablishment of market mechanisms in the economy, our\r\nState is becoming integrated into the worldwide process. By\r\nclosely interacting with foreign partners and pursuing a\r\nvigorous foreign policy, we are confident that these tasks\r\nwill be implemented promptly and efficiently.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.50 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
