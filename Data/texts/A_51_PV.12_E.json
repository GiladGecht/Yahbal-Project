(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and External Trade of Iceland, His Excellency\r\nMr. Halldór Ásgrímsson.\r\nMr. Ásgrímsson (Iceland): May I congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly and pledge to you the full\r\nsupport of my delegation.\r\nDuring the past fiftieth-anniversary year, the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations have reaffirmed their\r\nsupport for the fundamental purposes and principles of the\r\nOrganization. The momentum created by the anniversary\r\nmust now be used to adapt the Organization to new\r\nrealities. To this end, both structural and financial reforms\r\nmust be undertaken, setting priorities and reallocating\r\nlimited resources. But the point of the exercise must not be\r\nsimple cost-cutting. What we need above all is a stronger,\r\nnot a weaker, Organization, better capable of dealing with\r\nthe enormous global challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations. The\r\nfurther evolution of the Organization is therefore inevitable.\r\nBut the Organization will not evolve in a commonly\r\nacceptable direction under duress. Agreement on and\r\nimplementation of necessary reforms will only be achieved\r\nin a spirit of dialogue and accommodation.\r\nThis applies not least to the ongoing work to adapt\r\nthe Security Council. Changes in its composition and\r\nworking methods should remain a priority. The Council\r\nmust better reflect political and economic realities in a\r\nrapidly changing world. Its continued effectiveness\r\ndepends on a constructive contribution by all its members,\r\nas well as on equitable representation and manageable\r\nsize. There should be a geographically balanced expansion\r\nof seats in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories, including permanent seats for Germany and\r\nJapan. We should ensure that small and medium-sized\r\nStates have the possibility to be represented in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe United Nations system must be strengthened\r\nfurther in the fields of economic and social policy and\r\ndevelopment. The revitalization of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council is important if the Council is to serve as\r\nan important venue for coordination and policy-making on\r\nissues which affect our daily existence. Iceland is a\r\ncandidate for election to the Economic and Social Council\r\nfor the next term and is prepared to contribute\r\nconstructively to the work of the Council and to the\r\ndebate on its future.\r\nMr. Baumanis (Latvia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT) this week will be remembered as an\r\nimportant step towards limiting the nuclear-arms race and\r\nsetting us on the path of genuine nuclear disarmament. I\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nwould like to urge Member countries to sign and ratify the\r\nTreaty as soon as possible.\r\nThe proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of\r\nmass destruction is of continuous concern to the\r\ninternational community. Unconditional and universal\r\nadherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), the chemical weapons and biological\r\nweapons Conventions, and now the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is a critical step towards\r\neliminating weapons that threaten life on our planet.\r\nBut the horrors associated with weapons of mass\r\ndestruction must not blind us to the widespread suffering\r\ncaused by increasingly destructive conventional arms.\r\nLandmines especially are a growing menace,\r\nindiscriminately maiming and killing innocents no less than\r\ncombatants. Iceland strongly supports a comprehensive ban\r\non the use, production and export of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines.\r\nIn the aftermath of the cold war, it has become\r\nincreasingly clear how prolonged regional conflicts can\r\nhave serious international implications. Events in Iraq are\r\nonly the most recent example. Such conflicts need to be\r\naddressed in a comprehensive manner by the United\r\nNations. In addition to the important function of the\r\nSecurity Council, the wider United Nations system should\r\nbe employed more actively to prevent armed conflicts as\r\nwell as to assist in the reconstruction of societies emerging\r\nfrom war. Vigilance towards threats or acts of aggression\r\nwhich can erode regional or international stability is a\r\nnecessary part of such preventive activity. International\r\nterrorism is aggression by unconventional means. Its\r\nvictims are mainly civilians. The use or sanction of\r\nterrorism by individual States is unacceptable. The action\r\nof the international community should properly reflect the\r\nuniversal abhorrence of alliances between terrorists and\r\nindividual States.\r\nThe sinister scheming of terrorists and organized crime\r\nis of growing concern, not least since it is frequently based\r\non illicit drug trafficking. The United Nations can do much\r\nto enhance international cooperation in crime prevention\r\nand in the suppression of drug trafficking across national\r\nboundaries. Iceland supports the holding of a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in 1998 devoted to drug\r\ncontrol.\r\nThe international community must move swiftly to\r\nenhance respect for relevant human rights instruments in\r\nareas of conflict. The establishment of international war\r\ncrimes tribunals is a step in the right direction, provided\r\nthey receive the cooperation necessary to fulfil their\r\nmandate from all parties concerned.\r\nThrough a series of international conferences, the\r\nOrganization has, during the past few years, addressed the\r\nmost important issues facing humankind. These\r\nconferences have highlighted both the enormity of our\r\ntask and the complex interrelationship between the\r\nvarious global issues we are often called upon to deal\r\nwith, be they absolute poverty, environmental degradation,\r\noverpopulation, human rights abuses or social injustice.\r\nHaving concluded this unprecedented series of\r\nconferences with the second United Nations Conference\r\non Human Settlements in Istanbul last June, we owe it to\r\nfuture generations to join hands and spare no effort to\r\nimplement the decisions reached.\r\nUniversal human rights are the foundation on which\r\nwe base the work of the United Nations. This includes the\r\nsafeguarding of gender equality and the rights of the most\r\nvulnerable groups in society: the poor and the disabled.\r\nChildren are increasingly the target of atrocities in war\r\nand of human rights violations. Six years after the World\r\nSummit for Children we still must do a better job of\r\nhonouring our commitments to children. In this context,\r\nIceland welcomes in particular the recommendations of\r\nthe Stockholm World Congress against Commercial\r\nSexual Exploitation of Children and wishes to see them\r\nfollowed up as soon as possible.\r\nHunger and malnutrition are shameful phenomena on\r\nthe eve of the twenty-first century. With the resources at\r\nits disposal, the international community should be able\r\nto provide food security for the whole of mankind. The\r\nforthcoming World Food Summit will hopefully secure a\r\ncommitment at the highest political level to rapidly\r\nachieve this objective.\r\nAs a country owing its survival and prosperity to the\r\nharvesting of living marine resources, Iceland has\r\nconsistently underlined the potential of the oceans as a\r\nmajor source of nutrition. Icelandic fisheries have\r\ndeveloped experience and technology which could benefit\r\nothers. The Government of Iceland is prepared to\r\nfacilitate international cooperation in this field. Iceland\r\nhas contributed actively to the establishment of\r\ninternational law governing the protection and sustainable\r\nutilization of the oceans. The United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea has already proven to be a historic\r\nsuccess in the field of international law and remains\r\namong the greatest achievements of the United Nations.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nThe seas and the ocean floors are the depositories of\r\nenormous resources. The agreement of the international\r\ncommunity on an extensive legal framework on this subject\r\nis therefore a major accomplishment. The Convention offers\r\nthe prospect of resolving serious conflicts on the uses of the\r\nseas which could be detrimental to international\r\ncooperation. The Convention has already provided the basis\r\nfor further agreements, such as the recently concluded\r\nAgreement relating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\r\nIceland has actively participated in the adoption of the\r\nGlobal Programme of Action for the Protection of the\r\nMarine Environment from Land-based Activities. Pollution\r\nof this sort is responsible for over 80 per cent of all marine\r\npollution. In order to facilitate the implementation of the\r\nProgramme, a draft resolution on institutional arrangements\r\nwill be addressed by the General Assembly at this session.\r\nHowever, major challenges remain. Controlling the use\r\nof persistent organic pollutants needs to be addressed.\r\nIceland welcomes the proposal put forward within the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme to establish an\r\ninternational committee in 1997 with the aim of reaching a\r\nglobal agreement on this question.\r\nThis year, Iceland celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nits membership in the United Nations. We have strongly\r\nemphasized constructive participation. This reflects our\r\nbelief in the importance of multilateral cooperation for\r\nsmaller States and, in particular, in the hopes and\r\naspirations attached to the world Organization.\r\nThe United Nations is ideally capable of achievements\r\nin specific areas which are beyond the reach of national or\r\nregional authorities. However, it will never attain the\r\ncapacity to meet all expectations. As Member States debate\r\nreforms, I would like to emphasize the importance of\r\nsetting priorities and making them well known. The shaping\r\nof a new United Nations suited for the twenty-first century\r\nmust be complemented by vigorous information efforts with\r\nthe aim of ensuring continued public confidence and\r\nsupport.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Finland, Her Excellency Ms. Tarja\r\nKaarina Halonen.\r\nMs. Halonen (Finland): Let me offer Ambassador\r\nRazali my sincerest congratulation on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. This session will\r\naddress many difficult and important questions. I am\r\nconfident that under his experienced and wise leadership\r\nwe shall achieve good and constructive results. I should\r\nalso like to express the thanks and appreciation of my\r\nGovernment to the Secretary-General and to the many\r\ndedicated women and men in the Secretariat.\r\nLet me refer to the statement made by the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister of Ireland on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. My Government fully endorses that statement.\r\nAs the United Nations enters its fifty-first year, one\r\nconclusion is self-evident: questions of peace,\r\ndevelopment and human rights can no longer be neatly\r\nseparated. They interact, and nowhere more so than at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet me begin with human rights. There can be no\r\nsustainable peace in societies where the human rights of\r\nindividuals are not respected or where their democratic\r\naspirations are denied. Widespread violations of human\r\nrights, including the rights of minorities, breed instability\r\nand conflict. The United Nations is then, often too late,\r\ncalled upon to deal with them. There can be no\r\nsustainable development in societies where economic and\r\nsocial rights, as well as political rights, are flouted.\r\nAuthoritarian rule is no answer to poverty or\r\nenvironmental degradation. The universality of human\r\nrights cannot be questioned. True, civilizations differ;\r\nsocieties differ. But that does not mean that cultural,\r\nreligious, ideological or any other factors can be invoked\r\nas legitimate justifications for human rights violations. To\r\ndo so is to deny the inherent equality of human beings.\r\nBut adherence to general principles is not enough.\r\nThe litmus test is, of course, practice. Here at the United\r\nNations we must ask ourselves what we can do together\r\nto promote respect for human rights. I see at least three\r\nareas where the General Assembly can and should act.\r\nFirst, we must see to it that the United Nations\r\nmechanisms that have been created to promote and\r\nmonitor respect for human rights are not impaired through\r\nlack of funds. The High Commissioner for Human Rights,\r\nhis special rapporteurs and the human rights treaty bodies\r\nwithin the United Nations system are entitled to our\r\nsupport. The General Assembly should insist on the\r\nnecessary funding.\r\nSecondly, we must help establish, in accordance with\r\nthe conclusions of the Preparatory Committee, a\r\npermanent international criminal court to deal with\r\nflagrant violations of international humanitarian law and\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nhuman rights. I do not have to belabour the reasons why.\r\nOne look at Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia is enough.\r\nThirdly, we must ensure sustained and integrated\r\nfollow-up of the United Nations conferences from Vienna\r\nto Istanbul, so as to implement fully the agreed programmes\r\nof action. Nationally, Governments must commit the\r\nresources necessary to make the agreed actions a reality. In\r\nthe case of the Vienna and Beijing Conferences in\r\nparticular, full and equal enjoyment of human rights by all\r\nwomen everywhere must be the first goal towards which\r\nthe United Nations and all Governments must aspire.\r\nIn Finland, women gained full political rights — the\r\nright to vote and, just as important, the right to be eligible\r\nfor Parliament — as early as 1906; that is, 90 years ago.\r\nFinland thus became the very first country in the world\r\nwhere this was made possible. We have come a long way\r\nsince then, but we still need to do better until, finally,\r\nwomen are just as equally empowered in Finnish society as\r\nmen. I know that the same is true to varying degrees in\r\nother countries too.\r\nChildren, whether girls or boys, are full-fledged\r\nsubjects of human rights. Almost universal ratification of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\nhas been achieved. States Parties must now ensure universal\r\nimplementation too. The message from the recent\r\nStockholm World Congress against Commercial Sexual\r\nExploitation of Children was clear: full implementation of\r\nchildren’s rights is also the best guarantee against sexual\r\nexploitation. The United Nations must now, along with\r\nGovernments, follow up the commitments of Stockholm,\r\nand with vigour.\r\nEven the most democratic societies are vulnerable to\r\nconflicts, even to armed ones. We should therefore do our\r\nutmost to prevent them and, to this end, make full use of\r\nall means available to the international community.\r\nFinland believes in United Nations peacekeeping. We\r\nhave participated for 40 years and stand ready to continue.\r\nThe sheer complexity of modern-day conflicts has turned\r\nUnited Nations thinking towards comprehensive peace\r\noperations. Peacekeeping must be seen as a part of a\r\ncomprehensive peace process. We welcome this approach.\r\nThe civilian and military elements of a peace operation\r\nshould operate in close cooperation. Artificial barriers\r\nseparating the two should be eliminated right at the outset\r\nin devising the mandate for an operation. It is also\r\nimportant that peace operations be linked with longer-term\r\npeace-building efforts to promote stability and sustainable\r\nhuman development.\r\nLessons have been learned the hard way in the past\r\nfew years. United Nations peacekeepers are not suited for\r\npeace enforcement. That job should and can be entrusted\r\nby the Security Council to others — whether regional\r\norganizations or other outside ad hoc coalitions — if\r\nnecessary. But these are exceptional cases. For the vast\r\nmajority of conflicts, the United Nations will be the one\r\ncalled upon for peacekeeping. Even if the United Nations\r\nmust be able to say no on occasions, the world\r\nOrganization cannot shirk its responsibility. Moreover,\r\nwhen the United Nations acts, it should act on time and\r\nwith the support of its members, including funding.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nTime is of the essence in responding to crises.\r\nFurther development of the existing standby arrangements\r\nwith Member States is the most practical way to enhance\r\nthe rapid-reaction capability of the Organization.\r\nTherefore, Finland strongly supports the establishment of\r\na rapidly deployable headquarters unit at the United\r\nNations as soon as possible.\r\nPrevention, naturally, is better than cure. In\r\npeacekeeping as well, preventive deployment is an\r\ninnovation that is working right now in The former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Finland is convinced\r\nthat the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force\r\n(UNPREDEP) operation is making a crucial contribution\r\nto stability in the whole region. It is a full-fledged\r\noperation in preventive diplomacy encompassing good\r\noffices, monitoring and human and institutional\r\ndevelopment, as well as troop deployment. That\r\ncontribution, based on the present mandate, should\r\ncontinue until peace and stability in the whole region are\r\nbetter assured.\r\nThis is the year of the nuclear-test ban. That is what\r\nthe General Assembly demanded a year ago, and that is\r\nwhat the vast majority of the world’s nations has now\r\nagreed. I was proud to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty for my country. That Treaty will\r\nstrengthen the security of all of us, without exception.\r\nBanning nuclear-test explosions is a goal to which the\r\ninternational community has been committed for decades.\r\nThe Treaty accomplishes that goal. At the same time, the\r\nTreaty is a step towards the ultimate elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nHowever, focusing on nuclear weapons is not enough.\r\nWe also need to focus on weapons that maim and kill\r\npeople today. Those weapons are conventional weapons,\r\nparticularly landmines, other small arms and light weapons.\r\nThe excessive accumulation and proliferation of small\r\narms threaten to destabilize communities, countries and\r\nentire regions. A United Nations expert panel, on which my\r\ncountry is represented, is looking into the problem right\r\nnow. Finland, for one, expects concrete recommendations\r\non how to deal with this clear and present danger\r\nnationally, regionally and through the United Nations.\r\nThe indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines is\r\nthe most visible manifestation of the small-arms emergency.\r\nWhen they finally achieve peace, societies already ravaged\r\nby years of war are severely hampered in their\r\nreconstruction efforts by landmines that have been\r\nindiscriminately sown by the millions. A concerted\r\ninternational effort, led by the United Nations, is needed to\r\nassist in mine clearance. Demining should also be made an\r\nintegral part of peacekeeping mandates, as was recently\r\nsuggested by Germany and endorsed by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIt is increasingly clear, however, that in the end only\r\na prohibition of inhumane and indiscriminate landmine use\r\ncan bring a real solution. To be effective, such a solution\r\nmust be legally binding, global and verifiable. As the first\r\nstep, all States should adhere to and abide by the\r\nsignificantly strengthened landmine Protocol to the\r\nConvention on conventional weapons. I find it very hard to\r\nunderstand why two out of three United Nations Member\r\nStates continue to remain outside that Convention.\r\nAs a concurrent step Finland proposes the initiation of\r\nglobal negotiations on a treaty banning anti-personnel\r\nlandmines altogether. A natural forum for such negotiations\r\nwould be the single negotiating body for disarmament that\r\nthe international community has at its disposal, namely, the\r\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva.\r\nFinland will work actively for the inclusion of a ban\r\non anti-personnel landmines in the negotiating agenda of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament when the Conference\r\nreconvenes in January.\r\nIn assisting in the creation of conditions of stability\r\nand well-being, the United Nations has effective economic\r\nand social tools at its disposal. A review of how the United\r\nNations does its business in this field is under way. The\r\napproval in May of the resolution on restructuring and\r\nrevitalization of some areas in the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil sector was an encouraging sign.\r\nThe yardstick in measuring United Nations impact\r\non development should be how the Organization has been\r\nable to alleviate poverty and contribute to the\r\nimprovement of the quality of life. The first priority now,\r\nas we see it, should be to assess the impact of the\r\ndevelopment activities of the United Nations system at the\r\ncountry level. We were pleased to note that last year the\r\nGeneral Assembly initiated a process to that effect.\r\nI have two remarks in this regard. First, it is\r\nnecessary to concentrate United Nations development\r\nactivities on the poorest countries and the most vulnerable\r\ngroups of society. Secondly, better integration of the\r\nUnited Nations at the country level would enhance\r\nefficiency. It would promote closer coordination between\r\ndevelopment activities, on the one hand, and humanitarian\r\nand peacekeeping activities on the other.\r\nThe commitments made at recent United Nations\r\nconferences provide a comprehensive agenda for\r\nfollow-up. One of the conferences, the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, will be\r\nprominently present at this fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. That Conference is a promising\r\nexample of the capabilities of the United Nations. It has\r\nmade global environmental concerns an everyday reality\r\nfor all of us. The follow-up session next year will afford\r\na unique opportunity to assess progress and review\r\npriorities.\r\nIn my view, one of the emerging priorities would be\r\na political commitment at the global level for sustainable\r\nforest management. Finland attaches great importance to\r\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Forests, which has been\r\nestablished and which expects to submit concrete action-\r\noriented recommendations to the special session.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I wish to refer to\r\nthe statement issued by the Presidency of the European\r\nUnion yesterday regarding the killings and violent\r\nincidents in the West Bank and Gaza. I want to state that\r\nmy Government fully endorses that statement. On behalf\r\nof the Government of Finland, I appeal to the parties\r\nconcerned to take every measure to restore calm and\r\nrefrain from acts of violence and provocation. We also\r\nurge the parties to re-engage the peace process, which had\r\nalready achieved such promising results.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nIn view of the Security Council’s primary role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the reform\r\nof the Council is of particular urgency. The discussions on\r\nthis subject during the fiftieth session were thorough and\r\nuseful. Convergence of views emerged on many important\r\nissues, yet on others, differences still remain. I believe that\r\nthe time is now ripe to take a step forward and engage in\r\nreal negotiations on a comprehensive reform of the Council.\r\nMeanwhile, in a few weeks we shall elect new non-\r\npermanent members to the present Security Council. As is\r\nwell known, the five Nordic Countries give their full\r\nsupport to Sweden. I am confident that the other Member\r\nStates will also recognize the merits of our neighbouring\r\ncountry.\r\nThe Deputy Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr. Dick\r\nSpring, when speaking on behalf of the European Union,\r\nunderlined the obligation of all Member States to pay their\r\narrears and their assessed contributions to the United\r\nNations. Finland having been the first Member State to pay\r\nin full, on time and without conditions its assessed\r\ncontribution to the regular budget of the United Nations in\r\n1996, I feel it both my right and my duty to reiterate that\r\nappeal.\r\nThe United Nations, we agree, needs renewed focus\r\nand streamlining. Let us now find the determination and\r\nwill to proceed with the necessary reform.\r\nAddress by Dato’ Seri Mahathir Mohamad, Prime\r\nMinister of Malaysia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Malaysia.\r\nDato’ Seri Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of\r\nMalaysia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Malaysia, His Excellency Dato’ Seri\r\nMahathir Mohamad, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Mahathir (Malaysia): I am happy to\r\nacknowledge a Malaysian as the President of the General\r\nAssembly, a first for Malaysia. We are thankful to all\r\nMember States for their support, especially the members of\r\nthe Asian Group, which endorsed Malaysia’s candidature\r\nearly.\r\nI would like to think that the selection has to do\r\nwith Malaysia’s efforts and involvement, with the United\r\nNations and globally. Within three years of Malaysia’s\r\nindependence, we were involved in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in the Congo. Today in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Malaysia is perhaps the only developing\r\ncountry participating in the peacekeeping forces led by\r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), paying\r\nin full the cost of our involvement. Malaysia will continue\r\nto participate in international activities, United Nations-\r\nsponsored or otherwise, combining altruism with\r\nenlightened self-interest.\r\nThis time last year, there was much celebration as\r\nthe United Nations attained its fiftieth year. Amid the\r\ncelebrations extolling the achievements of the United\r\nNations, there were serious concerns expressed about the\r\nrelevance and effectiveness of this Organization and the\r\nneed for democratic reforms so that the United Nations\r\ncould better fulfil the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter. The fiftieth anniversary came and went and,\r\ndespite the extravaganza, very little has been achieved.\r\nThe Organization itself remains far removed from\r\nthe aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations,\r\nwhich it is supposed to promote and protect. Hopefully,\r\nthe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina will, with\r\ninternational help, be on the mend, but Palestine’s hopes\r\nand aspirations have been undermined by the new Israeli\r\nGovernment, which is backed, unfortunately, by some\r\nWestern Powers, and is backtracking on painfully\r\nnegotiated agreements. At this moment, a rash decision by\r\nIsrael not only imperils further the peace process, with\r\nlives being lost, but can inflame and outrage Muslim\r\nStates and Muslim society if the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa\r\nMosque is defiled. In Africa, Somalia, Rwanda and\r\nLiberia remain on the razor’s edge of survival, and\r\nBurundi awaits United Nations and regional initiatives to\r\navoid a catastrophe. And there are countries such as\r\nAfghanistan, victims of the cold war, abandoned by the\r\nmajor Powers, needing help to reconstruct and overcome\r\nthe destruction wrought by war. And what will be the fate\r\nof tiny Chechnya and its valiant people, facing the full\r\nonslaught of mighty Russia?\r\nWhile some developing countries become\r\nfragmented and marginalized, the process of accruing\r\npower and benefits continues with the major countries,\r\naided by their control of the Security Council, their\r\nmonopoly on nuclear power and their economic high\r\nground. One sees various twists and turns, double\r\nstandards and selectivity, as the dictates of domestic\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\npolitics overrule justice and humanitarianism in\r\ninternational affairs. Commitment to multilateralism is so\r\nqualified and investment in the United Nations so tentative\r\nthat common needs have often been sacrificed.\r\nNow, as the General Assembly begins its fifty-first\r\nsession, we urge again that the international community\r\nwork collectively for substantial change, reflecting a more\r\nequitable sharing of political and economic power. This call\r\nfor reform is made even more urgent when we consider that\r\nthe premises by which international relations are conducted\r\ntoday continue to perpetuate a grossly unjust system.\r\nThe systematic abuse of power by the major countries\r\nhas continued. They apply selective sanctions and double\r\nstandards on the developing world to promote their narrow\r\nnational interests. Clearly disregarding multilateralism, with\r\nits inherent qualities of mutual respect and shared interests,\r\nthe North continues its vice-like grip on all spheres of\r\ninternational activity, including politics, international trade,\r\ndevelopment, the environment and the media to name a\r\nfew.\r\nElitism exercised by the major countries is frequently\r\ncloaked in the guise of globalism or of serving the common\r\ninterests of nations. However even a cursory examination\r\nof this brand of globalism reveals it to be sanctimonious, if\r\nnot hypocritical. For example, under the pretext of\r\nsafeguarding international peace and security, the nuclear-\r\nweapon States maintain their right to destroy, or threaten to\r\ndestroy, all life on this planet. Yet these countries deny\r\nothers even the right to use conventional weapons for self-\r\ndefence.\r\nMalaysia deeply regrets the lack of a consensus on the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty but welcomes its\r\nsubsequent adoption at the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. We worry about nuclear aspirations in our\r\nregion and in Israel. To a large extent, the refusal of the\r\nnuclear-weapon States to adopt a timetable for nuclear\r\ndisarmament is responsible for this situation and seriously\r\nflaws the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nMalaysia is encouraged by the recent International Court of\r\nJustice Advisory Opinion on the legality of the threat or use\r\nof nuclear weapons. To render the Court’s finding\r\nmeaningful, there should be serious efforts made towards\r\naccelerating the process of nuclear disarmament, including\r\nthe early convening of a special session of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to disarmament.\r\nWhile these major Powers advocate peace and\r\ncondemn arms races by others, their industries aggressively\r\ndevelop and promote the sales of defence technologies\r\nand weapons of death. Like a drug dealer supplying his\r\nhelplessly addicted victims, the northern-based arms\r\nindustries keep poor countries mired in a cycle of poverty\r\nand insecurity, laying waste vital human skills and\r\nresources.\r\nPerhaps such political elitism comes naturally to\r\nthese powerful countries, many of which were imperial\r\nPowers before. A clue as to their priorities for the global\r\nagenda is to be found in the recent communiqué of the\r\neconomic summit of the Group of Seven. Reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, in particular the Security Council, as an\r\nurgent issue, gave way to the pre-eminence of the\r\nglobalization of the world economy. And so, the Security\r\nCouncil remains a blunt instrument of the foreign policies\r\nof the permanent members.\r\nIn the context of a globalized world, much is made\r\nof the terms “interdependence” and “mutual interests”.\r\nMultilateralism has been elbowed aside. Yet\r\nmultilateralism is the foundation of the international\r\nrelations and cooperation which the United Nations\r\nsymbolizes. From now on, globalization will take over\r\nand nations will lose their sovereignty.\r\nConsider the current financial crisis that faces this\r\nOrganization. The United Nations is on the verge of\r\nbankruptcy, being held to ransom by its major donor\r\ncountry, the wealthiest nation in the world. That country\r\nrefuses to meet its assessed and legally due contributions,\r\nyet insists on maintaining its hegemony on global\r\nmanagement.\r\nThe major Powers’ solution to the United Nations\r\nstalemate is to speak of revitalizing the United Nations as\r\nif they were conducting a corporate downsizing exercise.\r\nWhile it is important to end bureaucratic inefficiencies\r\nand the wasteful use of resources, we should be mindful\r\nthat the United Nations is not a business.\r\nOverconcentration on internal-management issues can\r\ndeflect the attention of the United Nations from its major\r\nglobal responsibilities. While Malaysia is critical of the\r\nUnited Nations and its leadership, we cannot but regret\r\nthe tendency of major Powers to assign the United\r\nNations complex tasks, missions impossible, without clear\r\nmandates and authority or adequate resources. How does\r\nthe United Nations undertake peacekeeping operations\r\nwithout the authority or the means to keep the peace?\r\nWe find the inequities of power-sharing in the\r\nUnited Nations to be intolerable and view with alarm\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nprevailing trends towards weakening this Organization\r\nfurther. Already, the centre of gravity for all principal\r\neconomic decisions that affect developing countries lies in\r\nthe undemocratic Bretton Woods institutions, the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) and of course the self-appointed\r\nGroup of Seven.\r\nStrengthening multilateralism requires a reform of the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, which dominate the\r\ndevelopment scene. These institutions are operating against\r\ntheir general mandate. Decision-making is undemocratic\r\nand untransparent. Despite their specific mandates to\r\nfacilitate development and regulate the international\r\nmonetary system, these institutions are used to discipline\r\nthird-world countries and to act as debt collectors for the\r\nrich North. It is salutary to note that the World Bank\r\ncollected a net amount of $7.2 billion in 1995 in debt\r\nrepayment over and above what it disbursed in aid to the\r\npoor indebted countries and raked in a profit of almost $1.5\r\nbillion. The International Monetary Fund has now become\r\nan enforcer of the dictates of market lenders and is\r\nassuming the role of a global rating agency.\r\nThe majority of poor developing countries are saddled\r\nwith unsustainable levels of debt that preclude them from\r\na share of world prosperity and growth. Debt servicing on\r\ncurrent scales is untenable and debtor countries, as a\r\nconsequence, can do little to alleviate their poverty and\r\nmisery. The chilling numbers speak for themselves - more\r\nis spent on servicing debt than on financing basic\r\nprogrammes for health care, education and humanitarian\r\nrelief.\r\nThe reductions in the commitments for concessional\r\nassistance by almost all the industrial countries mark a\r\nturning point in international development cooperation.\r\nBluntly put, the rich have reneged on solemn commitments\r\nand pledges. The cut-backs in pledges for the replenishment\r\nof international development assistance and the\r\nunwillingness to clear earlier arrears, triggered by a\r\nunilateral decision of the major contributor to scale back its\r\ncontributions, have led other donors to scale back their\r\ncontributions as well.\r\nNow that the concept of globalism is so intimately\r\nlinked with international trade, it is important critically to\r\nexamine the realities of this so called “free trade”. The\r\npainfully long history of the Uruguay Round negotiations\r\nshould have forewarned us that the WTO, although\r\nestablished as a rules-based multilateral organization to\r\nregulate international trade, will become answerable only to\r\nthe world’s wealthiest economic Powers. Like the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, the WTO remains outside any\r\nrelationship of accountability to the far more democratic\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly.\r\nDuring the Uruguay Round, the developing countries\r\ndiscovered that, instead of negotiating international rules\r\non trade in manufactured goods, the rich countries of the\r\nNorth had widened the agenda and pushed for\r\nliberalization in economic areas where they clearly have\r\nan advantage, in particular, financial services and\r\ninvestments.\r\nEven though some countries of the South have\r\nbenefited from the liberalization of trade — and Malaysia\r\nis one of them — the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade (GATT) nevertheless harbours new threats to\r\ndeveloping and newly emerging economies. Not only\r\nhave the poor countries of the South to struggle uphill\r\nmerely to meet the basic needs of their peoples, but they\r\nare now bullied into adjusting their economic policies to\r\nmeet their new obligations under GATT so that northern-\r\nbased corporations can penetrate and capture their\r\nmarkets. The poor may not reserve their markets for\r\nthemselves even when they have no capacity to penetrate\r\nthe markets of the rich.\r\nFair competition and level playing fields are only for\r\nthe rich. For example, their attempts to link the\r\nenvironment and labour standards to trade in\r\nmanufactured goods is a clear attempt to deny developing\r\ncountries their meagre competitive advantage. The\r\nrelationship between trade and labour standards emerged\r\nnot because of a concern for the well-being of workers in\r\npoor countries, but as protectionist moves aimed against\r\ngrowing and competitively-priced imports from the South.\r\nTo compound this unfair interpretation of the\r\nmultilateral trade rules, we find that, when it comes to the\r\ntransfer of technology, the northern countries take a\r\nfiercely anti-liberal stand, insisting that all WTO member\r\nStates compulsorily introduce a set of national laws to\r\nprotect intellectual property rights. Since most patents are\r\nowned by the North, this in effect means legal protection\r\nof their technological monopoly and a drastic curtailment\r\nof the right of developing countries to have access to new\r\ntechnology.\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the northern interpretation\r\nof “free trade” and “liberalization” are slogans that in\r\nreality mean liberalization when it benefits the North but\r\nprotectionism if it can block the South. Thus, while goods\r\nand capital are permitted and encouraged to move around\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nthe globe, labour and technology may not. Even as we are\r\nasked to submit to GATT rules and the WTO, we find one\r\ncountry blatantly undermining the WTO by enacting\r\nextraterritorial laws that must be submitted to by all nations\r\nand their companies on pain of excommunication.\r\nThe GATT also fails to protect the genetic resources\r\nof the South while allowing genetically modified materials\r\nto be patented. We now have a situation where theft of\r\ngenetic resources by western biotech transnational\r\ncorporations enables them to make huge profits by\r\nproducing patented genetic mutations of these same\r\nmaterials. To what depths have we sunk in the global\r\nmarketplace when nature’s gifts to the poor may not be\r\nprotected but their modification by the rich becomes\r\nexclusive property?\r\nThere are of course many winners and losers in the\r\nworld of the WTO, but we are concerned that the major\r\nlosers will soon again be the poorest and most marginalized\r\ncountries. A small number of developing countries, like\r\nMalaysia, have benefited. But let me point out that our\r\ngains have been achieved through thrift, productivity and\r\nthe ingenuity of our people, hard-earned fruits of our\r\nlabour. Lest it be forgotten, our new-found prosperity has\r\nalso benefited those in the developed countries. Our\r\nproducts are competitively priced, thus contributing to\r\nlower inflation in the rich countries. Our prosperity has\r\nprovided vast and expanding markets for the goods of rich\r\ncountries, thus creating jobs and helping to lower their\r\nunemployment rates.\r\nThe term “globalization” has become the buzzword of\r\nour times. In the G-7 communiqué, globalization was touted\r\nas\r\n“a source of hope for the future ... responsible for the\r\nexpansion of wealth and prosperity in the world.”\r\n(A/51/208, annex II, para. 2)\r\nHowever, some would argue that globalization, with its\r\nobjectives of breaking down borders and sucking the\r\ncountries of the world into one single economic entity, has\r\neclipsed multilateralism or attempts to masquerade as the\r\nsame thing. Indeed, globalization has been described by the\r\nrich as a\r\n“new global partnership for development”. (ibid.,\r\nannex II, IV)\r\nIf the current behaviour of the rich countries is\r\nanything to go by, globalization simply means the breaking\r\ndown of the borders of countries so that those with the\r\ncapital and the goods will be free to dominate the\r\nmarkets. Colonies in the former British Empire will\r\nremember “Imperial Preference” when they were made\r\nthe exclusive markets of the metropolitan Power.\r\nGlobalization can mean just that, except that the world\r\nmarket will belong to the rich nations. Linkages to\r\nnon-trade issues will prevent the poor from ever\r\nchallenging the rich, in the same way that the colonies\r\nwere not allowed to industrialize.\r\nWe do indeed live in a brutal and unjust world,\r\nwhere the astonishing developments in science and\r\ntechnology and our increasingly sophisticated knowledge\r\nbase are not matched by the ability of Governments to\r\nmarshal forces to overcome the social and economic\r\ninequities of their countries. The facts and figures are\r\nwell documented and widely known, but they are worth\r\nrepeating just to jog our conscience — if we still have\r\none. What are the universal values of this globalized\r\nworld when increasing numbers of people in both the\r\nNorth and South live in abject poverty? A fifth of the\r\nhuman race — 1.3 billion people — lack access to the\r\nmost basic necessities, such as food and clean drinking\r\nwater, while preventable hunger and disease kill 35,000\r\nchildren throughout the world every day. The 1996 United\r\nNations Development Programme’s Human Development\r\nReport states that, in the past 40 years, the richest 20 per\r\ncent of people have seen the differential between\r\nthemselves and the poorest 20 per cent double.\r\nAre we expected to believe in the sincerity of the\r\nrich countries when they talk about a new global\r\npartnership and the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, when the fact is that, today, we have over\r\n20 million environmental refugees in addition to an equal\r\nnumber of traditional refugees? Why should the\r\ndeveloping countries accept the twisted lexicon of\r\nnorthern development-speak when “development\r\nassistance” means that the net flow of wealth from poor\r\ncountries to rich has increased to at least $400 billion a\r\nyear when the terms of trade, transfer pricing, debt\r\nservicing and the brain drain are taken into account.\r\nWading through the obstacles of this strife-torn\r\nworld is a critical dilemma that faces the international\r\ncommunity today. It is one of international leadership and\r\nthe failure to deal with these critical issues. Instead, we\r\nwitness a persistent abnegation by the major Powers of\r\nthe responsibilities that accompany the rights and\r\nprivileges of such authority. We must determine the type\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nof world and society we want to live in, and this should be\r\nbased on truly universal values.\r\nAs we approach the next millennium and as the\r\npre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the\r\ndefinition of national sovereignty, we must seriously\r\nquestion why a powerful minority is still allowed to\r\nbankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow\r\neconomic and political needs. The poor are no longer\r\nindependent. They have already lost control over their own\r\ncurrency. And now they have lost their borders too.\r\nFreedom of the press is touted as a basic democratic\r\nprinciple. But control of the media by a handful of western\r\ncorporations has made nonsense of this principle.\r\nProclaiming to be windows on the world, the western\r\nmedia, manipulated and censored by those in control,\r\ninvariably manage to distort reports so as to put anything\r\nhappening in the South in the worst possible light.\r\nAnything positive in the developing countries is ignored.\r\nThe growth and influence of electronic, satellite and\r\ninformation technology is astounding. But its impact poses\r\none of the biggest political and ethical challenges of our\r\ntime, subverting and distorting our social consciousness.\r\nThe elites of the North and the South have become blind to\r\nthe enormities of reality. Events and people are stripped of\r\ntheir context, so that we become less capable of recognizing\r\nthe common humanity and equal rights of all the people in\r\nthe world. Pictures of poverty and inequality are no longer\r\nreceived with moral outrage, but have become simple facts\r\nof life. Thus begins the process of dehumanization and\r\ndisengagement from the rest of human society.\r\nAlthough without a doubt the information age will\r\nbring cheap and easy access to knowledge and education\r\nand facilitate worldwide business, its abuse is already\r\naffecting the moral values of the world. Smut and violence\r\ngratuitously distributed by criminals in the North are no less\r\npolluting than carbon dioxide emissions nor less dangerous\r\nthan drug trafficking.\r\nIf one great Power can apply its laws to citizens of\r\nanother country it considers to be guilty of drug trafficking,\r\nwhy cannot countries with different moral codes extradite\r\nthe traffickers of pornography for legal action under the\r\nlaws of the offended countries? Why cannot there be\r\ninternational laws and international courts to punish those\r\nwho spread filth and incite racial hatred and racial\r\nviolence? Before the whole world sinks deeper into moral\r\ndecay, the international community should act. Abuse of the\r\nubiquitous Internet system must be stopped.\r\nThe monopoly of the electronic media by the North\r\nshould be broken. As it is, we are getting slanted news,\r\nmade worse by broadcasters interpreting in favour of their\r\nown or their countries’ interests. As usual, the poor\r\ncountries with no role in operating the international media\r\nhave become the principal victims of world news\r\nnetworks. Not only are distorted pictures of our countries\r\nbeing broadcast, but our own capacity to understand what\r\nis happening is being undermined. In the past, Western\r\nmissionaries spread the Gospel. Today the media has\r\ntaken over, and all our cherished values and diverse\r\ncultures are being destroyed.\r\nThe United Nations has not always been a failure. In\r\nits early years it helped to dismantle the empires of\r\nWestern European countries. Malaysia is grateful to it, for\r\nit too won freedom because of the moral suasion of the\r\nUnited Nations. But the United Nations now seems blind\r\nto what is being done to Iraq and Chechnya. One great\r\nPower continues its vendetta against Iraq, firing missiles\r\nat distant targets to bring the Iraqi leadership to its knees,\r\noblivious to the sufferings of the besieged Iraqi people.\r\nAnother Power has shut the gates of mercy on the\r\nChechens, and with rockets and bombs has killed\r\nindiscriminately and with appalling brutality in order that\r\nChechnya should remain part of an empire. How much\r\nmore should the Chechens suffer before the Security\r\nCouncil takes notice? Where are the vaunted defenders of\r\nhuman rights who claim that national borders will not\r\nstop them?\r\nIt is a fact that every year many statements are made\r\nat the United Nations that lament the crises of poverty,\r\nthird-world debt, human rights abuses, conflicts and wars,\r\nsocial disintegration and environmental degradation. It is\r\nalmost boring. And yet nothing much has been done\r\nwhich could bring about an amelioration of this sad state\r\nof affairs.\r\nPerhaps it is because the processes of\r\nintergovernmental consensus decision-making of the\r\nUnited Nations are tedious and frustrating. Perhaps it is\r\nmismanagement by the Governments of so many poor\r\nnations which afford many excuses for the rich not to\r\nhelp.\r\nIt is of course easy to use the United Nations as a\r\nforum to unmask the hypocrisies of both the North and\r\nthe South, but it is more difficult to work collectively to\r\nimplement change and solve problems. Still, Malaysia\r\nbelieves that this repetitive criticism is valid and\r\nnecessary, that international injustice and oppression\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nshould not be swept into the dustbins of history. I would\r\nlike to say again that Malaysia strongly believes in the\r\nmultilateralism of the United Nations and is prepared to\r\ninvest in this international Organization with all our\r\nstrength, beliefs and moral fibre.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Malaysia for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nDato’ Seri Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of\r\nMalaysia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Korea, His Excellency Mr. Ro-\r\nMyung Gong.\r\nMr. Gong (Republic of Korea): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of Korea, Sir,\r\nI would like to express my sincere congratulations on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that under your able\r\nleadership the Assembly will take action to revitalize the\r\nworld Organization, building on the foundation laid by your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal. My\r\ngratitude goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and the staff of the Secretariat for their\r\nexcellent work for this session.\r\nMr. Baumanis (Latvia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe most pressing business of this Assembly is to\r\ncreate the architecture for United Nations renewal. The\r\nMember States, with vision and determination, need to\r\nconstruct step by step a consensus on reform that will not\r\nonly bring the Organization out of its present crisis, but will\r\nalso prepare the world community to meet the challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century. We welcome the ongoing efforts\r\nto strengthen and revitalize the United Nations. But at the\r\nsame time we must admit that unless progress is accelerated\r\nin the months ahead, there is a real danger that the\r\nmomentum and sense of purpose spawned by the fiftieth\r\nanniversary could well be lost.\r\nMy Government actively supports the various working\r\ngroups of the General Assembly as they seek ways to make\r\nthe United Nations more effective, efficient and democratic.\r\nAs a member of the Group of Sixteen States in support of\r\nrenewing multilateralism, we are also pleased to actively\r\nparticipate in the efforts to enhance the principle of\r\nmultilateralism. The Group’s joint statement embodying this\r\nprinciple was reported to the General Assembly last\r\nWednesday by Prime Minister Persson of Sweden, on\r\nbehalf of the 16 Heads of State or Government.\r\nAll these efforts, however, will be of no use if\r\nMember States fail either to meet their financial\r\nobligations or to make the political compromises\r\nnecessary to produce a durable package of reforms. Let us\r\nnot forget that the very principles of multilateralism on\r\nwhich the United Nations was founded are at risk. As was\r\nso aptly put by the President of the General Assembly in\r\nhis 17 September inaugural speech, “the syndrome of\r\nbusiness as usual\u0027” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary Meetings, 1st\r\nmeeting, p. 3) must be discarded.\r\nOur Organization is in serious financial trouble due\r\nto the arrears and outstanding contributions of Member\r\nStates. The Security Council needs to be modernized to\r\nreflect the expansion in United Nations membership, to be\r\nmore equitably balanced geographically and to work\r\nefficiently, transparently and democratically. To better\r\nserve the needs of economic development and to reduce\r\nduplication, we should undertake a sweeping reassessment\r\nof the scores of subsidiary bodies of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and of the Assembly itself. While we\r\nwelcome General Assembly resolution 50/227 as a step in\r\nthe right direction, much more needs to be done. History\r\nwill not judge the United Nations on how many\r\ncommittees it forms or how many resolutions it passes,\r\nbut on how much it does on the ground, day in and day\r\nout, to further peace, prosperity and justice for the\r\nworld’s peoples.\r\nToday I would like to focus my remarks on four\r\nmajor challenges facing the United Nations and then to\r\nsay a few words about the situation on the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nIn considering the architecture for United Nations\r\nrenewal, we should shape an Organization better prepared\r\nto respond to the following four priority needs: first,\r\nrestraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive\r\nweaponry; secondly, bolstering United Nations capabilities\r\nfor effective peacekeeping and peace-building; thirdly,\r\nassisting economic and social development while\r\nenhancing protection of the environment; and fourthly,\r\nimproving mechanisms for ensuring respect for\r\ninternational law and human rights.\r\nCalls for a new international order will ring hollow\r\nwithout more reliable controls on the spread of dangerous\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\narmaments, particularly those capable of mass destruction.\r\nAs a supporter of the early conclusion of a comprehensive\r\ntest-ban treaty (CTBT), my Government heartily welcomed\r\nthe long-awaited adoption of the Treaty earlier this month.\r\nThe conclusion of the CTBT will help curb nuclear\r\nproliferation in all its forms and will contribute towards\r\nnuclear disarmament. As an original signatory to the CTBT,\r\nthe Republic of Korea aims to ratify the Treaty swiftly. In\r\norder for the CTBT to become universal and verifiable, my\r\nGovernment urges all countries to accede to the Treaty at\r\nthe earliest possible date.\r\nWhile the Conference on Disarmament failed to reach\r\nconsensus on the CTBT, the Conference, through two and\r\na half years of intense negotiations, was instrumental in\r\narticulating the eventual Treaty. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to pay tribute to the Conference and to assure\r\nthe Assembly that the Republic of Korea, as a new member\r\nof the Conference, will spare no efforts to contribute to its\r\nvital work.\r\nDespite much progress towards a world free of nuclear\r\nweapons, the Korean peninsula still faces the threat of\r\nnuclear proliferation. North Korea has yet to achieve\r\nnuclear transparency. Once again, my delegation urges\r\nNorth Korea to comply with its obligations under the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in\r\na comprehensive manner, and to implement fully and\r\nfaithfully the Framework Agreement between the United\r\nStates and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We\r\nalso renew our call on North Korea to live up to its\r\nobligations under the South-North Joint Declaration on the\r\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\r\nUntil they are eliminated from the face of the Earth,\r\nchemical and biological weapons too will pose a grave\r\nthreat to humanity. Towards this end, the Republic of\r\nKorea, as an original signatory to the chemical weapons\r\nConvention in 1993, recently concluded the domestic\r\nprocedures to ratify the Convention. We look forward to its\r\nswift entry into force, for universal adherence to the\r\nConvention is critical to achieving a total ban on chemical\r\nweapons. My delegation therefore strongly urges those\r\ncountries which have not yet joined the Convention,\r\nincluding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to do\r\nso as early as possible.\r\nMoreover, my Government, which acceded to the\r\nbiological weapons Convention supports the efforts to\r\nintroduce a strict verification system into the Convention.\r\nBoth of these non-proliferation measures are essential\r\nbuilding blocks for world peace.\r\nMy Government, moreover, shares the international\r\nconcern over the millions of anti-personnel landmines\r\nscattered throughout the world. We are looking forward\r\nto working closely with other Member States to minimize\r\nthe suffering and casualties among innocent civilians\r\ncaused by these indiscriminate weapons. To this end, I am\r\npleased to announce that the Republic of Korea will again\r\nextend its moratorium on the export of anti-personnel\r\nmines for another year.\r\nThe second priority for United Nations renewal\r\nshould be to adapt and bolster its uniquely valuable\r\npeacekeeping and peace- building work to meet new\r\nchallenges. Following several years of rising expectations\r\nand expanding mandates, Member States have developed\r\nover the past two years a more sober appreciation not\r\nonly of the limits of United Nations capabilities but, more\r\nimportant, of their own willingness to provide the\r\nrequisite material and human support for a more\r\nambitious role for the world body. Both the scope and the\r\nnature of peacekeeping operations are being tested as the\r\ndemands for United Nations involvement remain high in\r\na world confronted by an alarming number of intra-State\r\nconflicts and acts of terrorism.\r\nToday’s peacekeepers are often required to undertake\r\ndiverse tasks such as monitoring violations of human\r\nrights, staging elections, rehabilitating civic institutions\r\nand reintegrating combatants and refugees into peacetime\r\nsociety. Thus, peacekeeping now directly contributes to\r\npeace-building and conflict prevention. Post-conflict\r\npeace-building, by rehabilitating a country’s war-ravaged\r\neconomic and social base, can serve to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of conflict. Member States should recognize,\r\nhowever, that the broadening of peacekeeping objectives\r\nshould be matched by an expansion in the resources and\r\ncapabilities of the United Nations for carrying out these\r\ntasks. Peace, too, has a price.\r\nRecently, several promising proposals have been put\r\nforward for enhancing the rapid deployment capability of\r\nthe United Nations. We consider the United Nations\r\nsystem of standby arrangements — currently comprising\r\nof 59 countries, including the Republic of Korea — to be\r\nan innovative and practical mechanism for coping with\r\nemergency situations. We also believe that the growing\r\ninterest and participation of Member States have boosted\r\nthe credibility of the system of standby arrangements,\r\nmaking it easier to secure the consent of parties in a\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\ngiven conflict to United Nations peacekeeping involvement.\r\nIn addition, we support the establishment of a rapidly\r\ndeployable headquarters team within the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, as proposed by the friends of\r\nrapid deployment. The Korean Government is willing to\r\ndetail personnel to the team as part of our contribution to\r\nstrengthening the United Nations rapid deployment\r\ncapability.\r\nSince we first dispatched an engineering unit to the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation in Somalia in 1993,\r\nthe Republic of Korea has contributed to many\r\npeacekeeping operations around the world. We intend to\r\nexpand our participation in terms of human resources, and\r\nmaterial and political support for practical steps to improve\r\nthe peace-management capacity of the United Nations.\r\nIn an uncertain world, terrorism poses an ever-present\r\nthreat to international and domestic peace and security.\r\nHaving been a direct victim of terrorism, the Republic of\r\nKorea strongly condemns all acts of terrorism. We urge the\r\ninternational community to take firm action to contain and\r\ncombat terrorism. The 1994 Declaration on Measures to\r\nEliminate International Terrorism clearly states that\r\nterrorism in all forms is not only criminal, but also\r\nunjustifiable under any circumstances, regardless of\r\npolitical, ideological, ethnic or racial motivation. My\r\nGovernment reaffirms its strong commitment to join the\r\nongoing efforts to eradicate terrorism worldwide.\r\nEconomic and social development should also remain\r\na high priority at a time when scientific progress and\r\ninformation technology are globalizing the world economy\r\nat a rapid pace. Driven by unprecedented levels of cross-\r\nborder trade and investment, globalization presents new\r\nopportunities to bolster economic development and improve\r\nquality of life. Nonetheless, we must not lose sight of the\r\ndetrimental effects of this trend, which threaten to leave\r\nsome developing countries increasingly marginalized.\r\nThe United Nations has an obligation to try to help\r\nthose least developed countries, particularly in Africa, that\r\nare truly in need. My delegation fully supports the United\r\nNations System-wide Special Initiative for development in\r\nAfrica, a joint undertaking by the United Nations and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions launched last March. We look\r\nforward to joining other Member States in a common effort\r\nto bring this worthy endeavour to fruition.\r\nHaving risen from the devastation of the Korean War,\r\nthe Republic of Korea has achieved sustained economic\r\ngrowth and advancements in living standards over the past\r\nthree decades. Seeking to share the lessons of our own\r\ndevelopment experience, we have worked to help other\r\ndeveloping countries apply two key elements of our own\r\ngrowth: capacity-building and human resource\r\ndevelopment. The Korean International Cooperation\r\nAgency is implementing diverse programs to assist other\r\ndeveloping countries in this regard. At the same time,\r\nKorea will increase its voluntary contribution to the\r\noperational activities of the United Nations by 120 per\r\ncent during 1996-97. In these and many other ways, we\r\nare determined to participate in United Nations efforts to\r\nbring about economic and social progress throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nSince 1994, my Government has worked with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to\r\nestablish the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul. This\r\nInstitute will be dedicated to capacity-building for\r\ndeveloping countries in the development and use of\r\nvaccines, particularly for children and the impoverished.\r\nThe official launching of the International Vaccine\r\nInstitute will take place in New York on 28 October. We\r\nwould encourage as many countries as possible to show\r\ntheir support for this worthy and noble project by\r\nbecoming party to the agreement.\r\nThe emergence of unprecedented global\r\nenvironmental issues, such as climate change and\r\nbiodiversity, calls for genuine global partnership based on\r\nequitable burden-sharing. The special session on\r\nenvironmental issues of the General Assembly in 1997\r\nwill provide us with a valuable opportunity to formulate\r\na clear, sustainable development strategy for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. On 5 June 1997, immediately before the\r\nspecial session, my Government will co-host World\r\nEnvironment Day, together with the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), as part of our efforts\r\nto contribute to the resolution of environmental issues.\r\nThe fourth theme for United Nations renewal, in our\r\nview, should be to reinforce the unique United Nations\r\ncapacity for codifying, monitoring and encouraging\r\nrespect for international law and human rights. As the\r\nCharter so eloquently attests, genuine peace and stability\r\ndepend upon a healthy respect for international law and\r\nhuman rights norms. The continuing United Nations\r\ncommitment to human rights and social justice was\r\nreaffirmed by a series of international conferences during\r\nthe 1990s. They include the Vienna World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, in 1993, and the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women, held in Beijing in 1995.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nIn particular, the Beijing Conference underscored the\r\ncritical principle that gender equality — through the\r\nprotection of women’s human rights and the eradication of\r\nall forms of violence against women — forms the\r\nfoundation of a sound and prosperous society. The Republic\r\nof Korea is committed to maintaining its support for\r\ninternational efforts to advance the status of women.\r\nAll of us need to do more, however, to help the\r\nUnited Nations live up to its potential for promoting human\r\nrights. Its mechanisms for furthering respect for universal\r\nhuman rights need to be reinforced and upgraded across the\r\nboard. We need to enhance the coordinating role of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and of the resources\r\nof the Centre for Human Rights. The Korean Government\r\nwill do its best to make a meaningful contribution to this\r\nend.\r\nEnvisioned since the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals\r\nof a half century ago, the idea of an international court to\r\npunish crimes against humanity is now being materialized,\r\neven as the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals are\r\nstruggling to bring to justice criminals who have committed\r\ngenocide and other mass crimes. A preparatory committee\r\nis refining the draft statute of the international criminal\r\ncourt, prepared by the International Law Commission. We\r\nlook forward to the early establishment of the court, which\r\nwe believe will deter violators of human rights. We also\r\nwelcome the establishment of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea, which should contribute significantly\r\nto the strengthening of international law and order.\r\nThe road to democracy in the Republic of Korea has\r\nbeen long and difficult. Indeed, laying the foundation for\r\ndemocracy in a developing country is never easy. It\r\nrequires a vigilant public conscious of democracy and\r\nhuman rights and a government willing to nurture the will\r\nof its citizens. This has been and will remain a primary\r\nobjective of the Korean Government. We are making every\r\neffort to promote further human rights and democracy\r\nthrough the enhancement of our legal and institutional\r\nmechanisms.\r\nMy Government has also been active in the endeavour\r\nto assist the democratic impulse throughout the world.\r\nLending our support to the electoral assistance activities of\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nwe provided a dozen election monitors, as well as supplies,\r\nfor the international operation to ensure free and fair\r\nelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the past, we also\r\nparticipated in the electoral observer missions in\r\nMozambique, Cambodia, South Africa and Palestine.\r\nLet me now turn to the situation on the Korean\r\npeninsula. Despite the easing of tensions worldwide since\r\nthe end of the cold war, the Korean peninsula continues\r\nto be a source of instability, posing threats to the peace\r\nand security of north-east Asia and beyond.\r\nUnfortunately, the tides of openness and reconciliation\r\nthat swept other parts of the world have not yet reached\r\nthe Korean peninsula, the last remaining legacy of the\r\ncold war.\r\nLast week North Korea dispatched a military\r\nsubmarine to infiltrate armed commandos into the South.\r\nWe uncovered this infiltration when the submarine ran\r\naground on the shore of Kangrung, a city on the South\r\nKorean east coast, and 26 armed agents are believed to\r\nhave come ashore. Of these, 21 were killed and one was\r\ncaptured. According to the captured agent, the armed\r\ninfiltrators were all military officers from the North\r\nKorean defence ministry. Subsequent examinations also\r\nrevealed shocking findings. The 11 North Koreans found\r\ndead on the day of the landing were apparently killed by\r\ntheir cohorts for reasons unknown.\r\nThe investigation is still under way to find out the\r\npurpose of the infiltration and other details, but the\r\nfindings to date present a strong possibility that last\r\nweek’s infiltration is part of a larger-scale infiltration\r\noperation.\r\nThis brazen act of military provocation by North\r\nKorea constitutes not only a serious infringement of our\r\nterritorial waters and sovereignty, but also a blatant\r\nviolation of the Armistice Agreement. It also clearly\r\ndemonstrates that North Korea still seeks Korean\r\nreunification by any means, including the use of force.\r\nNeedless to say, this act of provocation poses a direct\r\nthreat to peace and stability on and around the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nWe once again urge North Korea immediately to\r\nrenounce its absurd goal of unifying Korea by force and\r\nto pursue peaceful coexistence with the South. The North\r\nshould also abide by the Armistice Agreement and end\r\nany attempt to disrupt the current armistice regime.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to renew our call on\r\nNorth Korea to accept our proposal for four-party talks\r\ninvolving both Koreas, China and the United States,\r\nwhich will enable constructive negotiations for the\r\nestablishment of a lasting peace on the peninsula. In the\r\nabsence of Pyongyang’s positive response and given the\r\nseriousness of North Korea’s violation of the armistice,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nmy country firmly believes that the Armistice Agreement\r\nshould remain in full force.\r\nAt the historic fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly, we took a collective look at where the United\r\nNations had been and where it was going. In an open and\r\nforward-looking spirit, we compared visions of the kind of\r\nworld body that will be needed to meet the challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century. Now, with this fifty-first session,\r\ncomes the hard part: redoubling our collective commitment\r\nto the world body so that it can become a means for\r\ntranslating our visions into realities.\r\nTogether, we can fashion the architecture of United\r\nNations renewal. Can we achieve harmony out of diversity?\r\nCan we refocus our energies on the four priorities of\r\nstemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nbolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building\r\ncapabilities, advancing sustainable economic and social\r\ndevelopment, and reinforcing our joint commitment to\r\ninternational law and human rights? The answer to these\r\nquestions must be a resounding collective “yes”. The\r\nRepublic of Korea stands ready to make its share of\r\ncontributions, through the United Nations, to meet the\r\nchallenges of the next century.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nRepresentative of Malta, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Cassar.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): May I congratulate the President\r\non his new responsibilities and pay tribute to Mr. Freitas\r\ndo Amaral of Portugal. During last year’s jubilee session,\r\nhis persistence furthered this Assembly’s revitalization\r\nprocess.\r\nLess than a year ago, world leaders met in this Hall to\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nand renew their commitment to the Charter. The world\r\ncommunity rejoiced. Hope had survived the darkness of the\r\ncold war. Trust in the United Nations was, however,\r\ntempered by an awareness of the difficulties threatening its\r\nsurvival and the aspirations of the peoples it represents.\r\nCould the Organization address the new phenomenon of\r\ninstability which risked sapping its capacities and\r\nresources? What prevailed was a pragmatic assessment. The\r\nalternatives to the United Nations were either that of\r\nattempting to reinvent the wheel or scuttling this forum of\r\ndialogue and cooperation to have arrogance and chaos usher\r\nin the new millennium.\r\nWe, the peoples, can ill afford war. Rhetoric can never\r\ncancel the grief and destruction it generates. The United\r\nNations was founded to save succeeding generations from\r\nthis scourge. Notwithstanding the then-widespread\r\ncolonialism and the angst of bipolarism, the world\r\ncommunity worked to contain the risk of war. As the\r\nability to destroy grew, so did the potential of States to be\r\nannihilated. Brave, bold steps required clear vision and a\r\ncommitment to peace. The Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, extended indefinitely\r\nlast year, is a monumental landmark in this arduous quest.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is another\r\nmilestone. Malta co-sponsored the resolution that led to\r\nits adoption by the General Assembly and is honoured to\r\nhave been amongst its first signatories.\r\nThe challenge remains. We must generate broader\r\nconfidence to ensure universal adherence and compliance\r\nto these treaties and others, including the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention. Procrastination in their ratification\r\nby the States that matter most could expose them to the\r\ndanger of becoming dead letters. Malta welcomes the\r\ncommitment expressed by President Clinton of the United\r\nStates of America in this regard.\r\nThe risk of world conflict, though remote, is still\r\npresent. The total horror of a nuclear holocaust induces an\r\nin-built restraint. This is not the case with conventional\r\narmaments or weapons of mass destruction. Millions of\r\nvictims of local and regional conflicts — be they dead,\r\nmaimed, refugees, displaced, widowed or orphaned —\r\ncontinue to torment the conscience of humankind. These\r\ntragedies spur us to pursue initiatives which foster\r\nsecurity and confidence. The call for a ban on the\r\nproduction, export and use of anti-personnel landmines\r\nhas Malta’s full support. The seven-point programme of\r\naction proposed by the Foreign Minister Kinkel of\r\nGermany provides a good basis for progress.\r\nWe must melt the bastions of suspicion. Only a\r\nconsolidated regime of confidence-building and\r\ndisarmament measures can buttress belief in and\r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. This\r\nprocess requires regional and international concerted\r\naction. Malta has been active in promoting security and\r\ncooperation in the Mediterranean. Malta and France have\r\nboth made proposals for a stability pact for the\r\nMediterranean. The sharing of concerns among countries\r\nafflicted by common problems can help overcome them.\r\nThis and other initiatives could turn our sea of turmoil\r\ninto one of mutual trust.\r\nMalta’s foreign policy is both inspired and\r\ndependent on the notion of regional stability. It continues\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nto sustain our efforts at greater Mediterranean cooperation.\r\nIt inspired our proposal to have the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe declare itself a regional\r\narrangement in terms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThe enlargement of the European Union, of which\r\nMalta expects to become a full member in the near future,\r\nprovides a unique dimension of the process of regional\r\ncooperation. Malta welcomes the statement made by Deputy\r\nPrime Minister Spring of Ireland on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. It reflects the common values which have always\r\ninspired the European process and led to the consolidation\r\nof democracy, prosperity, social justice and solidarity. In\r\nthe framework of the structured dialogue, Malta has worked\r\nwith its European Union partners on key issues to promote\r\npeaceful coexistence, cooperation, development and\r\nprogress within the world community.\r\nMalta supports the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.\r\nCooperation in the political, security, economic and\r\nfinancial areas cannot but yield results. Social, cultural and\r\nhuman relations are other important aspects of this\r\npartnership. Malta has always seen its application for\r\nmembership of the European Union in terms that\r\nencompass the economic and the broader political\r\ndimensions. The successful outcome of the negotiations on\r\nMalta’s accession, due to start in the coming months, will\r\nfurther strengthen our contribution.\r\nInterlocking institutions of the European security\r\narchitecture, such as the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, the Partnership for Peace and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, have strengthened the distinct areas of\r\ncooperation on which security depends. We must identify\r\nand combat threats to peace as they emerge.\r\nWe have witnessed the horror of intolerance based on\r\nnationality, race, creed or political belief. Agonizing\r\nconflicts and acts of terrorism have shattered lives and\r\ntrampled upon the rights and dignity of whole populations.\r\nSuch events have shocked us into action. The\r\nestablishment of the ad hoc Tribunals and the current\r\nnegotiations on the establishment of an international\r\ncriminal court, which Malta fully supports, are proof of the\r\nvaried manner in which the United Nations responds to new\r\nneeds.\r\nThe road to peace, through the compromise of\r\nnegotiated settlement, is not always immediate or popular.\r\nYet, it is the only path. Reconciliation does not happen of\r\nits own accord. It requires courage and leaders who\r\nstretch out their hand to their adversaries and build, brick\r\nby brick, the edifice of stability.\r\nThe universally acclaimed processes which rekindled\r\nthe hope of settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\r\nMiddle East are parts of this noble task.\r\nThe implementation of agreements reached between\r\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the\r\nresumption of negotiations and the full realization of the\r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people are\r\nindispensable for stability in the Middle East. The\r\ninternational community must continue to assist this\r\nprocess. Malta welcomes the first meeting between Prime\r\nMinister Netanyahu and President Arafat. The most recent\r\nincidents of violence in Jerusalem and Ramallah in recent\r\ndays give rise to great concern. The momentum of\r\nachievement should not be dissipated by acts which erode\r\nthe confidence built thus far.\r\nThe people of Cyprus have thirsted for peace and\r\nunity for too long and also deserve the attainment of a\r\njust and long-lasting settlement.\r\nIn this Hall, recognition was always and exclusively\r\nreserved for peacemakers. It was never bestowed on\r\nwarmongers, aggressors or cynics who constantly doubt\r\nand discourage others from building hope.\r\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund, the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nWorld Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and United Nations actions in\r\nPalestine, Namibia, Cambodia and Mozambique are part\r\nof this Organization’s history in contributing towards the\r\nwell-being and development of peoples, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building. The success achieved should not be\r\nrobbed of merit by instances where it is lacking. Are not\r\nthe Blue Helmets across the globe a signal of\r\nengagement? Are not negotiations on preventive\r\ndiplomacy a commitment to addressing the root causes of\r\ntension and conflict? Are not our deliberations on\r\ndevelopment means to create stability and well-being at\r\nthe local level?\r\nIn 50 years, we have created a range of tools to\r\npromote cooperation. True enough, our tools need\r\nperfecting. We must calibrate them to current realities.\r\nTools, however, need to be used. A shed full of perfect,\r\nbut unused, tools never provided any farmer with a\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nlivelihood. Only the will to operate tools and invest energy\r\nwhere it matters helps to reap the fruit.\r\nThe future demands a more action-oriented approach:\r\nmore time in the field, rather than pondering in the shed.\r\nThis resolve inspires us as we follow up the United Nations\r\nconferences on the environment, human rights, population,\r\nsocial development, women’s rights and human settlements.\r\nThe World Food Summit is another example of action.\r\nRenewed focus on development has led to various\r\ninitiatives, including those specific to Africa. Partnerships\r\nforged by the European Union and Japan with the\r\ndeveloping world reflect active cooperative involvement.\r\nAchievement registered by a number of developing States\r\nunderlines the benefit of such undertakings. The dialogue\r\ninstituted between Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of\r\n77 and the Group of Seven is an important and welcome\r\nstep.\r\nMalta’s academic institutions, in collaboration with\r\nUnited Nations agencies and the Commonwealth secretariat,\r\nannually sponsor and organize a number of training\r\nprogrammes. Most fall into the category of the training of\r\ntrainers. Students from the developing world and from\r\ncountries with economies in transition have attended short-\r\nor long-term courses and are now back in their countries\r\ndirectly contributing to development.\r\nMalta, through its Government and non-governmental\r\norganizations, regularly donates funds for a number of\r\nhumanitarian and overseas development aid programmes.\r\nThese initiatives, together with the traditional involvement\r\nof Maltese teachers and social workers in the developing\r\nworld as volunteers from non-governmental organizations\r\nor members of religious orders, symbolize our national\r\ncommitment to international solidarity.\r\nWe view our collective achievements with pride. Each\r\nconvention and treaty agreed upon by the international\r\ncommunity is a testimonial of our common will to build a\r\nbetter life, each a symbol of our resolve to beat our swords\r\ninto ploughshares. Yet, the anguished sea of faces of\r\nmillions of children denied the right to hope still haunts us,\r\nwhether it is war, famine, or exploitation which generates\r\nmisery. Our collective future can never be secure until these\r\nchildren acquire the right to smile in hope and to their fair\r\nshare in the bounties of society.\r\nCynicism and fatalism cannot cure us of social ills.\r\nBlended with hope, pragmatism yields reward. What is\r\nmore pragmatic than the care of the destitute to which\r\npeople like Mother Theresa dedicate their lives. One\r\nperson less going to bed with an empty stomach, one\r\nperson less torn with pain, one person less denied\r\nshelter — small pragmatic steps inspired by the innate\r\ndignity of each human being; acts of caring solidarity\r\nwhich each individual, each family, each community is\r\ncapable of; commitment to others generates hope. Each\r\nounce of food which alleviates famine; each drop of water\r\nwhich combats drought and desertification; each dose of\r\nmedicine which contains the spread of disease; each book\r\nwhich kindles knowledge helps build a better world.\r\nDemocracy, the rule of law, free and fair elections\r\nand constant vigilance in the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights are the guarantors of peace. International\r\nelection observer missions are an important contribution\r\nto confidence-building. Malta has participated in this\r\nprocess, most recently in Palestine and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nAs much as action is instrumental, so is restraint.\r\nEmissions which pollute the environment; lumbering\r\nwhich depletes the rain forests; indiscriminate trawling\r\nwhich exhausts our fishstocks — even if disguised as\r\neconomic imperatives — undermine efforts towards\r\nsustainable development.\r\nMalta looks forward to this Assembly’s 1997 special\r\nsession to follow up and update the Rio achievements.\r\nWe have strategies and action plans. Now is the time\r\nfor dynamic engagement. Present and future generations\r\ndemand that we use these instruments to combat drug\r\ntrafficking, illicit arms transfers, money laundering and\r\norganized crime, which sap the life of the communities\r\nwe built with so much effort.\r\nMy Government is totally committed in this regard.\r\nLegislation adopted has strengthened the arm of the law\r\nin apprehending traffickers, halting the flow of drugs and\r\nconfiscating illegal funds accrued. This determined policy\r\nis bearing fruit. Malta supports the convening of a\r\nGeneral Assembly special session in 1998\r\ncomprehensively to address drug trafficking and related\r\nissues. Poland’s proposed convention to fight transnational\r\ncrime has been noted with interest. Regional and\r\ninternational cooperation on these issues remains the key\r\nto success.\r\nOur children have a right to a life free from fear in\r\na safer world. That remains our responsibility as parents\r\nand policy makers.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nThe United Nations is often accused of lacking in its\r\nassigned role. Yet the United Nations is what Member\r\nStates make of it. They decide on its future. United Nations\r\nreform requires discipline in our operating methods. We\r\nhave to discard self-imposed fetters and act with the\r\nrevived spirit that our times demand.\r\nTempered by the fires of conflict and the lessons of\r\nthe League of Nations, the founding fathers built into the\r\nCharter a balance worth preserving. Reform should not be\r\nreduced to a simple juxtaposition of organizational charts.\r\nOnly by revitalizing the spirit that gives our Organization\r\nlife and purpose will we achieve the ideal of nations large\r\nand small working in unison for a better world.\r\nAs President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth\r\nsession, in the immediate aftermath of the cold war, my\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, Mr. Guido de Marco, called for\r\nreflection and action to better the symbiotic relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations principal organs. Since then\r\nworking groups have been set up to discuss restructuring.\r\nWithin the Security Council reform group, work has\r\nevolved, but it is still far from reaching common ground.\r\nThere is consensus that the Council should be expanded and\r\nbe more representative. The type of expansion and the\r\ncategories are still subject to a wide divergence of views.\r\nMalta looks forward to an expanded Security Council that\r\nbest serves the world community. On the merits of\r\nincreasing the Council’s permanent membership, we still\r\nhave an open mind. The very nature of permanence\r\ndemands that we establish clear and exact criteria on\r\nrequired qualifications for present and future candidates.\r\nGiving due recognition to changes in international\r\nrelations and the nature and extent of the contribution of\r\nStates towards tasks assigned to the Council, we must avoid\r\nrigid stances or those that may be construed as such. There\r\nare a number of compromise proposals that could help us\r\nfind a solution, even if temporarily. We have listened with\r\ngreat attention and positive interest to Foreign Minister Dini\r\nexplaining the Italian proposal as one which takes into\r\naccount both the special contribution of a number of States\r\nand the right of all States to serve on the Council regardless\r\nof their size, wealth or military might.\r\nOnly understandings between States that win the\r\nconfidence of all can assist us in surmounting existing\r\nobstacles. We are satisfied to note the consensus existing on\r\nbettering the important qualitative relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. Changes\r\nintroduced in the working methods of the Council are an\r\nindication of a universal positive disposition.\r\nThe Open-ended High-level Working Group on the\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system has registered\r\nsignificant progress and tackled a variety of complex\r\nissues. Malta has consistently advocated greater efficiency\r\nand a more effective role for the General Assembly to\r\ndissipate negative perceptions that may exist.\r\nResponsibilities of this Assembly, of which we are all\r\npermanent members, are many and varied. We have\r\nalready noted the benefits of streamlining. More is\r\nrequired. Our deliberations have an impact on public\r\nopinion and political contingencies. We would be remiss\r\nif indifference or bureaucratization were to numb us from\r\nfully assuming the responsibilities and obligations\r\nimposed by the Charter.\r\nStarting with the forty-fifth session, my Deputy\r\nPrime Minister has also called for a review of the role of\r\nthe Trusteeship Council. Creating or abolishing\r\ninstitutions necessarily has an impact on the principles on\r\nwhich they are based. The balance characteristic of the\r\nCharter needs to be enhanced rather than diluted. The\r\nUnited Nations should continue to cherish all principles\r\non which it was founded, including the notion of trust, on\r\nwhich the Trusteeship Council rests.\r\nLast year, Malta submitted a resolution seeking the\r\nopinion of States on the Trusteeship Council’s future. The\r\ndiversity of views expressed is indicative of the existing\r\npotential. Malta looks forward to further discussion on the\r\nsubject, confident in the will to better utilize existing\r\ninstitutions to serve the principles of the Charter. Our\r\ncommon heritage and the welfare of future generations\r\ndemand that in reorienting the United Nations we\r\npreserve and protect the vision and ideals that gave it\r\nbirth.\r\nThirty years ago Malta launched the concept of\r\ncommon heritage. This concept has become ingrained in\r\nthe reality of the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea and the International Sea-Bed Authority. It\r\ntakes time for ideas to mature and consensus to emerge.\r\nThe most recent development, which we welcome, is the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, to be\r\ninaugurated at Hamburg, Germany, next month. Those\r\ninstitutions will undoubtedly continue to contribute to the\r\nunderlying principle of trust in protecting and preserving\r\nour common heritage.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nThe financial crisis facing the Organization has\r\ndampened hopes and discouraged many. Malta believes that\r\nthe ongoing exercise of assessing costs, eliminating waste\r\nand rationalizing structures must go on. Although pruning\r\nis essential to strengthen the United Nations, so also is the\r\nneed for all Member States to meet obligations and to pay\r\ntheir assessed contributions to the regular and peacekeeping\r\nbudgets, in full, promptly and without conditions.\r\nDiscussion on the scale of assessments will also contribute\r\nto improving the financial base of the Organization.\r\n“Bankruptcy” is an awful word. It is too often\r\nrepeated in relation to the United Nations. Finances are\r\nundoubtedly a cause of common concern. There is,\r\nhowever, another threatening phenomenon which looms —\r\nmoral bankruptcy. This is by far the greater danger and the\r\none that we should fear most.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, a second-generation\r\nUnited Nations had to find in its Member States the resolve\r\nand commitment to face winds of change that at times\r\nassume the force of gales and whirlwinds. With a steady\r\nhand on the rudder and our eyes fixed on that guiding star\r\nthat inspired the founding fathers, we can still bring ship to\r\nport. The fate of humankind is our precious cargo and\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jaime Gama, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Portugal.\r\nMr. Gama (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): I should first like to\r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly on his\r\nelection and to express our confidence in his capability to\r\nconduct the work of the current session. In congratulating\r\nhim on his election, I am pleased by the fact that he\r\nrepresents a country, Malaysia, with which Portugal has\r\nexcellent relations in addition to deep historical and cultural\r\nties.\r\nI believe that it is understandable that I should also\r\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to the outgoing\r\nPresident, my fellow countryman Mr. Freitas do Amaral,\r\nfor the dedicated, competent and innovative manner in\r\nwhich he directed the work of the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI wish also to express to the Secretary-General my\r\nadmiration for the manner in which he has carried out his\r\nfunctions during a period in which the United Nations has\r\nbeen called upon to take an ever more active role in a\r\nvariety of aspects of international life.\r\nMy colleague from Ireland has already addressed the\r\nAssembly on behalf of the 15 member States of the\r\nEuropean Union, expressing positions to which Portugal\r\nfully subscribes. Nevertheless, I would like to reflect on\r\nsome questions that are of particular importance to my\r\ncountry.\r\nAllow me to point out that while speaking in my\r\ncapacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, I am\r\nalso speaking as a representative of a country that is\r\nextremely proud to belong to the Lusophone Community.\r\nThis is probably the newest international organization, and\r\nas President of its Council of Ministers, I foresee an\r\nimportant role for it in the concert of nations, in useful\r\nand effective cooperation with the United Nations and its\r\nagencies. It represents a strengthening of the solidarity\r\nand fraternity that unite these countries and will empower\r\nthe economic and social development of its peoples, while\r\naffirming and disseminating the Portuguese language,\r\nwhich is the common heritage of over 200 million people\r\nscattered over every continent.\r\nThe Lusophone Community, made up of Angola,\r\nBrazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao\r\nTome and Principe and Portugal, is a political project\r\nbased on the Portuguese language, which is the historic\r\nbond and a common heritage of the seven countries,\r\ndespite geographical separation. It will always be an open\r\nforum, based on mutual support and close relationships\r\nwith all Portuguese-speaking communities of the world\r\nand cooperation with other, similar organizations.\r\nOne year after the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary, we are still far from meeting the expectations\r\ncreated and the real needs of the Organization. It is clear\r\nthat a process on this scale can be realized only in the\r\nmedium term.\r\nA core issue of the reform process that we must\r\naddress is the resolution of the serious financial crisis of\r\nthe United Nations. We believe that the resolution of the\r\ncrisis can be found through three essential approaches: the\r\nfulfilment of commitments, in full and on time; review of\r\nthe scale of assessments in order to reflect the capacity of\r\nMember States to pay; and financial rigour and\r\nrationalization of existing resources. In the spirit of\r\ncontributing to the resolution of this crisis, Portugal\r\nvoluntarily increased its 1995 contributions to the\r\npeacekeeping budget, moving from Group C to Group B\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nin the scale of assessments. That decision will result in a\r\nfive-fold increase of our initial contribution.\r\nEqually important is the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are convinced that only with an adequate and\r\nbalanced representation of all the world’s regions will the\r\nSecurity Council be more democratic and, consequently,\r\nmore effective in the formulation and implementation of its\r\ndecisions.\r\nWhen considering the process of reform, I must also\r\nrefer to issues related to the Agenda for Development and\r\nthe Agenda for Peace. With regard to the former, we must\r\nrecognize the need to review the entire system of\r\ninternational aid for development and consider the role the\r\nUnited Nations should play in this domain.\r\nThe integrated and sustainable development we\r\npropose should be pursued in all its facets, not only in the\r\neconomic field, but also in the consolidation of democratic\r\ninstitutions. To meet these objectives, it will also be\r\nnecessary to implement the decisions taken at the major\r\nUnited Nations global conferences, as it has been at those\r\nconferences that the Agenda for Development has gradually\r\ntaken shape. This question is all the more important to us\r\nin Portugal, since we focus special attention on the\r\nNorth-South dialogue, which is attested to by the fact that\r\nthe North-South Centre is located in Lisbon.\r\nAware of the fact that today the important task in this\r\narea is to help the developing countries, especially the more\r\nvulnerable ones, Portugal has gradually increased the funds\r\nit sets aside for development aid, both at the bilateral level\r\nand through the framework of international organizations of\r\nwhich it is a member. In this context, our official\r\ndevelopment assistance exceeds the goal established for\r\ndonors at the Paris conference in 1990.\r\nAt the multilateral level, allow me to single out the\r\nimportance we attribute to the Lomé Convention as a vital\r\ninstrument of aid and cooperation between the members of\r\nthe European Union and the countries of Africa, the\r\nCaribbean and the Pacific. Thus, we have strongly\r\nadvocated a review of the Convention based on maintaining\r\nthe principles of partnership and cooperation.\r\nMaintaining international peace and security\r\nundoubtedly continues to be the priority challenge faced by\r\nthe United Nations. The results achieved in most of the\r\nrelevant missions lead us to conclude that we should not\r\nlessen our commitment or the dynamism of our activity.\r\nIt is true that the United Nations cannot abdicate its\r\nmission of helping to restore peace. We also believe,\r\nhowever, that efforts should be focused on conflict\r\nprevention. But in both areas, the question of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional\r\nintergovernmental organizations has been discerningly\r\nraised. This can be seen in some recent successful\r\nexamples, such as the joint action of the United Nations,\r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the\r\nWestern European Union (WEU), the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia, organizations of which Portugal is a member\r\nand in which it participates actively.\r\nAnother component of the efforts towards peace is\r\ndisarmament. Portugal welcomes the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\r\nPortugal, which will contribute significantly to the CTBT\r\nverification system, has signed and will shortly ratify the\r\nTreaty, and appeals to all Member States of the United\r\nNations to do the same.\r\nIt is urgent that the process of enlarging the\r\nConference on Disarmament be completed, as well as that\r\nof deliberating on its agenda and the rules for decision-\r\nmaking and for admission of new members, which should\r\nbe improved. It is increasingly essential to seriously\r\ndebate nuclear disarmament, with a view to achieving the\r\nultimate goal of the permanent eradication of nuclear\r\nweapons. We advocate that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament should, early at its next session, begin\r\nnegotiations on a treaty for the banning of the production\r\nof fissile material for nuclear weapons.\r\nWith regard to the serious problem of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, Portugal hopes that concrete measures will be\r\ntaken this year towards a complete prohibition of the\r\nmanufacture and export of those devices of death and\r\ndestruction. For our part, we have already decreed a\r\nmoratorium on the manufacture and export of such\r\nweapons. Furthermore, I would like to mention that on 23\r\nAugust last my country ratified the Convention on the\r\nbanning of chemical weapons.\r\nAmong the many activities of the United Nations, I\r\nwould like to single out two areas which I consider\r\nessential: the environment and human rights.\r\nThe protection of the environment is becoming an\r\nincreasingly prominent issue. In this field, we recognize\r\nthe great importance of the problems of climate change,\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\ndesertification and the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment. For this reason, Portugal has been closely\r\nfollowing the implementation of the principles and\r\ndecisions adopted in this regard at major United Nations\r\nconferences.\r\nI would also like to underline the particular sensitivity\r\nof Portugal, whose territory includes two archipelagos —\r\nthe Azores and Madeira — to questions relating to the sea\r\nfrom a perspective of the development of balanced\r\nmanagement of fishing and marine resources. To this end,\r\nmy country is currently concluding the necessary\r\nprocedures that will soon permit it to ratify the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nFurthermore, on Portugal’s initiative, the General\r\nAssembly, at its forty-ninth session, declared 1998\r\nInternational Year of the Ocean. Focusing on this subject,\r\nExpo 98 will be held in Lisbon that same year, with the\r\ntheme, “The oceans: a heritage for the future”. Its central\r\nfocus will be the relationship between the current state of\r\nknowledge on marine resources and the urgency of\r\nensuring, through a rational and scientific management\r\nprocess, a greater ecological equilibrium on our planet.\r\nThe defence and promotion of human rights is one of\r\nthe principal concerns of Portuguese foreign policy. We\r\nbelieve that it is the responsibility of every Government to\r\nguarantee in their respective countries the full enjoyment of\r\nall human rights, but that it is also legitimate for the\r\ninternational community to concern itself with ensuring the\r\npromotion and protection of those rights around the globe.\r\nWe consider that the United Nations has a key role to\r\nplay, and thus it is indispensable that the High\r\nCommissioner and the Centre for Human Rights be\r\nprovided with adequate human and financial resources for\r\nthe fulfilment of his important task.\r\nA constant pursuit of Portuguese foreign policy has\r\nbeen to stress the need to find a political and diplomatic\r\nsolution to the question of East Timor, without which it\r\nwill not be possible to put an to end the systematic abuses\r\nof human rights that continue to prevail in that territory.\r\nPortugal has repeatedly stated — and I do so here\r\nonce again — that its sole objective, apart from the\r\nimmediate concern of defending the human rights and\r\nidentity of the people of East Timor in their different\r\naspects, is to find a just, comprehensive and internationally\r\nacceptable solution to the question of East Timor, in\r\naccordance with international law and the full respect for\r\nthe rights of its people, namely its right to\r\nself-determination.\r\nDespite the difficulties that have been encountered,\r\nthe difference between the substantive positions of\r\nPortugal and Indonesia and the slowness of the process,\r\nwe continue to be committed to finding such a solution\r\nthrough dialogue and under the auspices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, whose patient efforts I wish to pay tribute to\r\nhere. In the pursuit of that objective, we consider it\r\nextremely important to continue the active association of\r\nTimorese representatives to that process, which deserves\r\nthe unequivocal support of the international community.\r\nIn this regard, I must note here the increasing\r\nsupport that this question has received from the\r\ninternational community, namely through the adoption of\r\npositions that range from the resolutions of the European\r\nParliament to the declarations of the 21 Heads of State\r\nand Government of the member countries of the Ibero-\r\nAmerican summit, and include the common position\r\nadopted this year by the 15 member States of the\r\nEuropean Union, to which a further 14 European\r\ncountries associated themselves.\r\nPortugal, exercising its responsibilities as\r\nadministering Power of the non-self-governing territory of\r\nEast Timor, will continue to cooperate constructively with\r\nthe United Nations, with full regard for the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the relevant resolutions, towards the\r\nindispensable conclusion of the process of decolonization\r\nin East Timor.\r\nIn this era, at the close of the millennium, marked\r\nby such profound changes and close interdependencies,\r\nwe believe that the African continent deserves special\r\nattention from the international community. To that end,\r\nall efforts should be pooled towards the creation of\r\nconditions that will permit it to benefit from a\r\ndevelopment process similar to that enjoyed by other\r\nregions of the world.\r\nWe are therefore acting in the context of the\r\ninternational organizations of which we are members,\r\nwith the aim of preventing the marginalization of the\r\nAfrican continent and ensuring that it receives priority\r\ntreatment on the agenda of the international community.\r\nBecause we actively uphold this view, Portugal has\r\nproposed to its European Union partners that a\r\nEuro-African summit take place, open to the participation\r\nof all African States without exception, so as to allow for\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\na political dialogue at the very highest level on issues of\r\nmutual concern. The goal is to achieve a new dimension to\r\nour relations and provide a further impulse to traditional\r\nareas of mutual cooperation in order to create the\r\nfoundations of a new global partnership. The 15 Member\r\nStates of the European Union have already recognized the\r\ninterest and importance of this initiative.\r\nIn this manner, we are seeking to include Africa in all\r\nits aspects on the international agenda, stressing, on the one\r\nhand, the scale and economic potential of the African\r\ncontinent, which is deserving of a new approach and a new\r\nmodel for dialogue, and, on the other hand, encouraging\r\nAfrican countries to embark on their own process of\r\ndevelopment based on the promotion of peace, democracy,\r\nstability and economic and social progress.\r\nWe supported from the very beginning the creation\r\nand establishment of the Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity at the Cairo summit in 1993.\r\nPortugal attaches great importance to strengthening the\r\ndialogue between the European Union and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community. The second ministerial\r\nsummit, planned for this October in Windhoek, will\r\ncertainly allow for a global review of the adequacy of the\r\nactivities undertaken as a result of the Berlin conference.\r\nPortugal, a member of the troika of observers to the\r\npeace process in Angola, continues to be particularly\r\nengaged in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol,\r\nwhich seeks, in general terms, the re-establishment in\r\nAngola of constitutional democratic life and the formation\r\nof a single national army.\r\nI take this opportunity to salute the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, whose negotiating\r\nskills constitute an important factor in placing peace and\r\nhope in a better future once more on the horizon for all\r\nAngolans.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the positive developments\r\nthat have taken place over the last few months in the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which have\r\npermitted the cessation of hostilities throughout the entire\r\nterritory of Angola. However, we cannot ignore the fact\r\nthat important tasks remain to be completed, without which\r\nthe irreversibility of the peace process cannot be\r\nguaranteed. The postponement of the resolution of military\r\nand political questions is difficult to understand and may\r\njeopardize the process of consolidating peace.\r\nAllow me therefore to recall the concerns expressed\r\nin the declaration of the troika of observers — Portugal,\r\nthe Russian Federation and the United States — issued on\r\n22 August 1996. I appeal to the Government of Angola\r\nand to UNITA to continue to follow the path of peace\r\nthey have set out on in order to contribute decisively to\r\nthe full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, namely\r\nthrough one armed force and the creation of conditions\r\nfor the free movement of people and goods, which would\r\nmake possible the normal functioning of society, the\r\neconomy and the institutions in that great African country.\r\nI should also like to appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation\r\nof Angola. In particular, it is urgent that the necessary\r\nfunds be made available for the implementation of the\r\nprogrammes for the demobilization of former combatants.\r\nSocial stability is indispensable to the success of the\r\npeace process.\r\nI would not like to end this reference to Africa\r\nwithout expressing concern for the situation currently\r\nprevailing in the Great Lakes region, which has tragic\r\nrepercussions on the security and well-being of innocent\r\npeoples. Portugal is participating in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to bring to an end this tragedy of\r\nthe African continent and to ensure the return of stability\r\nto that region.\r\nPortugal did not remain indifferent to the suffering\r\nof the peoples of the Balkans or to a situation with\r\nserious consequences for peace and stability in the region.\r\nPortugal therefore participates in the Implementation\r\nForce with a significant military, police and civilian\r\ncontingent, very often demonstrating a greater effort and\r\nengagement than that of other countries with larger\r\neconomic capacities.\r\nThe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nrepresented an important step towards the consolidation of\r\npeace, and we are confident that they will have a lasting\r\neffect on the consolidation of the Bosnian State — based\r\non its two entities — allowing for a self-sustained\r\nstability of the country and the reconfiguration of the\r\nInternational Force so as not to affect the fundamental\r\ngoal of guaranteeing peace and the coexistence of the\r\nthree communities.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nPortugal will be the host country for the next summit\r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), which will take place in Lisbon on 2-3 December\r\nnext. We hope that the 53 Heads of State and Government\r\nwill take substantial decisions with regard to the\r\ncornerstone principles of a security model for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. I am certain that the Lisbon charter, to be\r\nadopted at that meeting, will represent a significant step\r\ntowards the stability of the European continent and the\r\ninstitutional strengthening of the OSCE.\r\nPortugal has promoted closer and deeper ties with the\r\ncountries of the Mediterranean, especially those of the\r\nMaghreb, a region of fundamental importance for the\r\nsecurity, stability and development of the entire region. In\r\nthe short term, it is necessary to adopt confidence-building\r\nmeasures that would contribute to launching the foundations\r\nof a new type of relationship between the peoples of both\r\nsides of the Mediterranean. Portugal is committed to the\r\ncreation of a Euro-Mediterranean charter, a matrix for a\r\nnew partnership that will contribute decisively to the\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural development of our\r\nMediterranean partners.\r\nPortugal is following with great concern the latest\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process.\r\nWe believe that the future of the region depends\r\nessentially on the will of the parties urgently to restart the\r\nnegotiations in accordance with the principles of Madrid\r\nand the Oslo terms of reference. I appeal to all interested\r\nparties to exhibit restraint and to honour previously\r\nassumed commitments, which is the only way to achieve a\r\njust, comprehensive and lasting peace for the region. The\r\ndramatic incidents that have just occurred are the clearest\r\ndemonstration that there is no alternative to the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nPortugal has very strong human, historical and cultural\r\nties with Latin America. The next Ibero-American Summit,\r\nwhich will take place in Chile, will represent another\r\noccasion to debate the important advances that the\r\nprocesses of democratization and development have\r\nachieved on that continent. Furthermore Portugal welcomes\r\nthe holding in 1998 of the seventh Ibero-American Summit\r\nof Heads of State and Government.\r\nPortugal welcomes the projects for inter-American\r\nregional integration, as well as the mechanisms for\r\ncooperation, that have been gradually established between\r\nthe countries of that continent and the European Union.\r\nThe development of a relationship with Asia also\r\nconstitutes one of the Government of Portugal’s foreign-\r\npolicy priorities. We share a common historical heritage\r\nwith many countries in that region. At the bilateral level,\r\nin addition to opening new embassies in South-East Asia,\r\nwe will be seeking to strengthen even further our\r\nrelationship with the Pacific island States, which will\r\ncertainly be reflected in the framework of the Lomé\r\nConvention.\r\nIn terms of our multilateral participation, we hope\r\nthat the new dialogue created in the framework of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will\r\nrepresent a significant step in the relationship between\r\nEurope and Asia, leading to a more open and broader\r\ncontact on all matters of mutual interest to the European\r\nUnion and Asia.\r\nThe transitional process in Macao, to be completed\r\nat the end of 1999, based on a constructive dialogue and\r\nclose cooperation with China, is of the greatest\r\nimportance to the Government of Portugal, whose\r\nfundamental concern is to guarantee the prosperity and\r\nstability of the territory, as well as to preserve its identity.\r\nThe multilateral dynamic is undeniably gaining an\r\never-greater importance in the international realities of the\r\npresent. Portugal has been developing unequivocal efforts\r\ntowards strengthening its participation in the organizations\r\nto which it already belongs and becoming involved in\r\nnew multilateral frameworks. Clear evidence of Portugal’s\r\nattitude in this respect is our increasing participation in\r\npeacekeeping operations. Portugal has considerable forces\r\nin Bosnia and Angola, and currently has the sensitive\r\nresponsibility of ensuring command of the United Nations\r\nforce in the Western Sahara. I am pleased to note that in\r\nthe domain of peacekeeping and international security, we\r\nare the European Union’s sixth-largest troop contributor\r\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations, and the ninth\r\nlargest among those countries that make up the Western\r\nEuropean and other States group. We are clearly in the\r\ntop half of the list of countries that contribute forces to\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. We also lead\r\nother Member States with greater resources and per capita\r\noutput.\r\nPortugal’s candidature for membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should be considered as an important\r\nexpression of the will of my country to continue to\r\nparticipate, as fully as possible, in the multilateral\r\ndimension of today’s world. Portugal is a country with a\r\nuniversalist commitment, which is used to establishing\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\ncontact with many and diverse regions of the world, and to\r\nunderstanding and accepting different cultures and\r\ncivilizations.\r\nWe therefore believe that as a member of the Security\r\nCouncil we would be able to contribute to finding solutions\r\nin accordance with the principles and purposes enshrined in\r\nthe Charter. We also believe that participation in the\r\nSecurity Council by States of a size and with characteristics\r\nsimilar to those of Portugal would contribute to greater\r\nequilibrium and representativity in the decisions taken by\r\nthat body.\r\nThis will be possible only when full respect is given\r\nto the principle of sovereign equality of all Member States,\r\nwhich, in truth, represents the principal guarantee of\r\ndemocracy in the Security Council. Yet this principle has\r\nnot been observed in practice. Indeed, out of the 185\r\nMember States, 79 have never served on the Security\r\nCouncil and 44 have served only once, as is the case with\r\nPortugal.\r\nWe can and should improve this situation. Indeed, to\r\nguarantee adequate representation by Member States on the\r\nSecurity Council, obstacles or precedents must not be used\r\nthat would prevent a healthy rotation in that organ. For\r\nthese reasons, the Portuguese candidature for membership\r\nof the Security Council is based on its own merits. We\r\nrefuse to resort to any alliances, coalitions or other artificial\r\nmeans that would limit and condition the right of choice of\r\nMember States.\r\nPortugal’s candidature was not launched to defend\r\ninterests or to respond to the demands of domestic politics,\r\nnor was it launched to pursue or consolidate external\r\nambitions. Portuguese foreign policy is an undivided whole.\r\nIt is part of, and evolves within, a well-defined\r\ngeo-strategic space. It is not based on arrogance or\r\neconomic power, nor has it been altered to accommodate\r\nPortugal’s candidature. The foreign policy of my country is\r\nbased consistently on its universalist commitment to\r\ndialogue with all the peoples of the world.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to cast my vote of\r\nconfidence in the future of the United Nations and to\r\nreiterate Portugal’s full commitment to the reform of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Niger, His Excellency Mr. André\r\nSalifou.\r\nMr. Salifou (Niger) (interpretation from French): It\r\ngives me great pleasure to convey to Mr. Razali Ismail\r\nthe heartfelt congratulations of the delegation of Niger on\r\nhis outstanding election to the presidency of the United\r\nNations General Assembly at its fifty-first session. His\r\nelection is testimony to the high esteem and prestige\r\nenjoyed by his country, Malaysia, in international affairs\r\nfor its contribution to the attainment of the ideals of our\r\nOrganization. It is also recognition of the fact that he is\r\na seasoned diplomat and a man of great experience.\r\nI extend my congratulations to the other officers of\r\nthe Assembly, and we assure Mr. Razali of the full\r\ncooperation of the delegation of Niger in the discharge of\r\nhis duties. I should like to convey to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, our great\r\npleasure at, and our compliments on, the excellent job he\r\ndid during his presidency.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Niger, General\r\nIbrahim Maïnassara Barré, reaffirms his unreserved\r\nsupport for and encouragement to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts for\r\npeace and development. As the Assembly knows, this\r\nsupport was demonstrated to the Secretary-General at the\r\nrecent Summit of Heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), when my country\r\njoined the unanimous tribute to him.\r\nI know that my country’s decision to propose one of\r\nour sons as a possible candidate for the post of Secretary-\r\nGeneral has given rise to much comment. Let me here\r\nmake it clear that Mr. Hamid Algabid, the candidate in\r\nquestion, is simply a “candidate for the candidacy”. In\r\nother words, if in the coming weeks no veto opposes the\r\nre-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Africa would only stand to gain. It would be\r\nperfectly normal for a son of our continent, who is just as\r\nqualified as his predecessors, to enjoy, as they did, a\r\nsecond mandate at the head of our distinguished\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe annual session of the General Assembly gives\r\nmy country an opportunity to renew its faith in the ideals\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. The fiftieth\r\nanniversary of our Organization, which we\r\ncommemorated last year, gave us an opportunity to look\r\nat the progress made and to define the priorities on which\r\nwe should focus. Among those priorities is joint action by\r\nthe international community to reduce the economic\r\nimbalance between the nations of the North and the\r\nnations of the South. Unfortunately, the map of economic\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nand social development of the world contains a geography\r\nof contrasts and disparities, although there were reasonable\r\nhopes that the end of the cold war would facilitate the\r\nmobilization of the international community for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nEverywhere, and more specifically in the countries of\r\nthe South, poverty is the greatest threat to political stability\r\nand social cohesion. The destitution of the shanty towns,\r\nthe destitution of the street children, and absolute poverty\r\nare a disgrace to us all, and they will be as long as we see\r\nmarginalization as inevitable. As the Director-General of\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, Frederico Mayor, stated so well:\r\n“From poverty to marginalization, from\r\nmarginalization to exclusion: this is how the most\r\nfertile breeding ground for violence is created.”\r\nIt is this violence which we must avoid, by offering\r\nbetter alternatives to the peoples to whom we are\r\nresponsible — most particularly in Africa. Indeed, this\r\ncontinent shows signs of being a land full of vitality,\r\ncapable of major economic achievements, if the\r\ninternational community gives us a chance and the\r\nresources. Accordingly, the commitments jointly entered\r\ninto in the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s are as relevant as ever.\r\nAnd more than ever they require that greater efforts be\r\nmade for Africa by other members of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe question of external debt, and in particular the\r\nquestion of multilateral debt, which was given special\r\nattention at the G-7 summit in Lyon deserves radical,\r\nurgent treatment. Niger fully supports the recommendations\r\nadopted at the mid-term review of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa. We welcome the\r\nlaunching on 15 March 1996 of the United Nations System-\r\nwide Initiative on Africa. We hope that this programme,\r\nwhich is in any case an important framework for\r\ncooperation, will make it possible to ensure sustainable\r\neconomic and social development in Africa.\r\nOfficial Development Assistance — quite rightly\r\nidentified as one of the main conditions for the\r\nrevitalization of the African countries — should be\r\nincreased to the level indicated in the resolutions adopted\r\non this subject. At the upcoming Singapore meeting of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization appropriate follow-up action\r\nshould be taken to ensure that the rights and interests of all\r\ncountries, and in particular of the African countries, be\r\nprotected. Likewise, the provision of technical and\r\nfinancial assistance to implement horizontal and vertical\r\npolicies to diversify exports will give African countries\r\nthe means for greater economic independence.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, our Organization has\r\ncertainly had some success in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Among these successes\r\nwas the coming into being of a democratic and multiracial\r\nSouth Africa and the end of the disastrous war in\r\nMozambique. We have also made significant progress in\r\nthe peace process in Angola, in the crisis in the Middle\r\nEast and in the former Yugoslavia, in particular the\r\nholding a few days ago of elections in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Niger is following closely the efforts\r\nundertaken by the authorities in Rwanda to overcome the\r\naftermath of the tragic events we all witnessed and in\r\nparticular to consolidate national reconciliation and lasting\r\npeace.\r\nThe situation in Liberia has seen a change for the\r\nbetter after the recent Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) summit devoted to that\r\ncountry. Niger supports the recommendations which\r\nemerged from it and has decided, despite our own\r\nfinancial difficulties, inter alia, to strengthen the structure\r\nof the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in\r\nLiberia by sending a contingent of about 500 men. My\r\ncountry believes, however, that these efforts will only be\r\nsuccessful with the valuable support of the international\r\ncommunity, which inter alia must honour its\r\ncommitments to this country.I take this opportunity to\r\ncommend the tireless efforts made in Liberia by Nigeria,\r\nthe great friend and brother of Niger.\r\nSomalia also deserves support. My country has been\r\nfollowing with great interest the evolution of the situation\r\nin Western Sahara and hopes for a resumption of dialogue\r\nbetween the two main protagonists there so that, in the\r\nnear future, efforts by made by the United Nations will\r\nfinally lead to the self-determination referendum which\r\nthe international community hopes to see. Concerning the\r\nsanctions imposed on Libya, Niger believes that the\r\nconstructive proposals made by the authorities of that\r\ncountry provide a serious basis for negotiations to resolve\r\nthat crisis, the consequences of which are adversely\r\naffecting the Libyan people as well neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nIn the Middle East, for three years now, considerable\r\nprogress has been made on the path to peace. Until\r\nrecently, President Arafat, living among his own people,\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nwas developing a dialogue with his former enemies that,\r\nwhile certainly difficult, was also useful. With the support\r\nof the international community, that dialogue must go on.\r\nBut unfortunately, since the return of the right wing to\r\npower in Israel, all hopes seem to have been dashed. Our\r\nOrganization must shoulder its responsibilities and do\r\neverything in its power to stop the Middle East from\r\nplunging into a new war with unforeseeable consequences.\r\nIf the State of Israel has the right to exist and to live in\r\npeace, the same goes for all States in the region —\r\nbeginning with Palestine.\r\nNiger is similarly concerned about the serious situation\r\nin Jammu and Kashmir and hopes that the international\r\ncommunity will discuss it further. It is indispensable that in\r\nthat region of the world as well, and with the\r\nencouragement of all countries of good will, that wisdom\r\nand dialogue prevails, so that in the near future the people\r\nof Kashmir can finally exercise freely their inalienable right\r\nto self-determination.\r\nDisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, including nuclear weapons, have a central\r\nrole to play in conflict prevention and the promotion of\r\npeace and economic and social development. This is why\r\nNiger renews its appeal for universal accession to\r\ninternational conventions and treaties that relate to weapons\r\nof mass destruction, and in particular to the cornerstone\r\ntreaty: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons.\r\nFurther efforts should be made to control conventional\r\nweapons and, generally speaking, to establish confidence-\r\nbuilding measures among States. The signing of the Treaty\r\nof Pelindaba, on the creation of a nuclear-weapon free zone\r\nin Africa, was a source of legitimate pride. My country\r\nwelcomes the adoption here in New York of the important\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which finally puts\r\nan end to the fears of millions of human beings for their\r\nlives and for their environment. It is certainly a significant\r\nstep towards nuclear non-proliferation. Niger was among\r\nthe sponsors of the resolution submitted by Australia, and\r\nwill be signing the Treaty in the near future. We hope that\r\nthis stage, which puts an end to the risks of horizontal\r\nproliferation, will lead to a substantial reduction in existing\r\narsenals.\r\nFinally, as in previous years, my country will join in\r\ninitiatives to be taken to combat illicit trafficking in small\r\narms. It will also join the increasingly unanimous\r\ncondemnation by the international community of the\r\nmanufacture and use of those deadly devices: anti-\r\npersonnel landmines.\r\nThe building of a better world, which is our common\r\ngoal, is still dependent on the establishment of\r\ninternational relations based on the principle of\r\ncooperation and human solidarity. We have had major\r\ndiscussions on this subject: in Rio on the environment, in\r\nCairo on population, in Copenhagen on social\r\ndevelopment, in Beijing on the promotion of women, in\r\nIstanbul on human settlements, and soon, in Rome, on\r\nfood. All the concerns of humanity have been taken into\r\naccount in the many important recommendations which\r\nemerged from those conferences and which outlined a\r\nvision of a better world. We believe that only genuine\r\nhuman solidarity can transform that vision into reality.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to provide an\r\noverview of the political solution in my country. Niger is\r\none of the African countries which, early on, chose the\r\npath of democracy. In less than five years, it has tried\r\neverything: a national conference, democratic transition,\r\nand free and transparent elections which established the\r\ninstitutions of our Third Republic. Following the dismissal\r\nof the Government by the National Assembly, and the\r\ndissolution of that Assembly by the President of the\r\nRepublic, the ensuing elections brought about the victory\r\nof the opposition and the establishment of a power-\r\nsharing regime marked by institutional instability in which\r\nthe higher interests of the country were sidelined. The\r\nresulting paralysis of State structures prompted the army\r\nto seize power. Understand me clearly: I have no wish to\r\njustify military coups d’état. But in Niger, the putsch was\r\nthe lesser evil. At least that is how it was perceived by\r\nthe people of Niger, who spontaneously organized\r\ndemonstrations in support of the new regime.\r\nAs I speak to you now, Niger, having elected a new\r\nPresident, General Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara, is now\r\npreparing for legislative elections. The Government is\r\ndoing this in cooperation with the opposition, which only\r\nlast week finally agreed to hold discussions with the\r\nrepresentatives of the presidential party and to define with\r\nit the conditions for organizing future popular elections.\r\nThe two parties have agreed to abandon sterile polemics\r\nand to create the calm conditions so necessary to work\r\neffectively in the higher interests of Niger.\r\nThis shows that Africa in general, and Niger in\r\nparticular, is not allergic to democracy. But in the matter\r\nat hand, what my country wants is to be given the\r\nopportunity to build to its democratic system — based,\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 27 September 1996\r\nwithout question, on respect for human rights and\r\nfreedoms — at its own pace, taking into account its own\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural context. And I\r\nventure here to say that one of the dominant features of\r\nAfrican culture is that we do not turn public administration\r\ninto a dichotomy between those in power and the\r\nopposition, between those responsible for running the\r\ncountry and those who are excluded from that process. In\r\nAfrica, we do everything together. We work together, we\r\neat together and we manage things together. Of course, in\r\nthe interest of the human community to which everyone\r\nbelongs, everyone should know his rightful place in this\r\nprocess and everyone should play the role he has been\r\ngiven.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to add that even just in\r\nour subregion, West Africa, there are several examples of\r\ncountries that have understood this process and that are\r\nfruitfully applying it on a daily basis. This is the case of\r\nSenegal and Burkina Faso. Let us try to find in our\r\nculture — or better in our cultures — all the elements\r\nthat can enable our countries to establish a viable,\r\nproperly adapted democracy, while also rejecting\r\ncategorically any kind of ready-to-wear democracy that\r\nmight be foisted upon us.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm Niger’s faith in\r\nthe ideals of the United Nations and in its ability to find\r\nin the solidarity of all its Members appropriate responses\r\nto the new challenges facing humanity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
