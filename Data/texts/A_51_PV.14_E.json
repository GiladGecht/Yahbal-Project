(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Worship of Bolivia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Aranibar Quiroga (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me to convey the congratulations of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Bolivia, President Razali\r\nIsmail, on your unanimous election, which is a token of the\r\nadmiration and esteem in which the peoples of the world\r\nhold Malaysia and constitutes just recognition of your\r\nmerits.\r\nMy delegation is grateful to the President of the\r\nAssembly at its previous session, Ambassador Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral, for the remarkable job he did. For the\r\ndelegation of Bolivia, it was a distinct honour to serve as\r\nVice-President of the Assembly under his able guidance.\r\nI wish also to congratulate Secretary-General Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali and extend to him our most sincere\r\nappreciation for his valuable contributions to international\r\npeace and cooperation, as well as for his insightful and\r\nuntiring dedication to the cause of the United Nations.\r\nAllow me first to refer to some aspects of the far-\r\nreaching structural reform in my country.\r\nDomestically, since 1993, the Administration of\r\nPresident Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada has been\r\nsimultaneously transforming the State and the system of\r\nsocial participation, while also adapting the productive\r\nbase of society to enable Bolivia to dynamically meet the\r\ndemands inherent to the changes in contemporary\r\ninternational life.\r\nThe Government of Bolivia’s current efforts are\r\nessentially based on the consolidation of participatory\r\ndemocratic institutions and on the conviction that\r\neconomic development must be compatible with care for\r\nnature and the environment — in other words, that this\r\nmust take place within the framework of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and of respect for ethnic and cultural\r\ndiversity, in order to make unity in diversity possible.\r\nMy Government’s national plan confers the highest\r\npriority on the struggle against poverty. It strives\r\nvigorously to increase work opportunities and seeks a\r\nbetter quality of life for all Bolivians, aiming to enter the\r\ntwenty-first century with a modern, decentralized,\r\nparticipatory State. This perspective guides our policies of\r\ngrass-roots participation, educational reform, and\r\ncapitalization of major public enterprises.\r\nPart and parcel of this landscape of change are our\r\ninitiatives in support of children, women and the elderly.\r\nWe are working hard to reduce infant and maternal\r\nmortality, to improve levels of nutrition and to provide\r\nassistance to those who most urgently need it. These tasks\r\nare an essential aspect of our effort to improve the lot of\r\npoor families.\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nMy country is proud of its pluri-cultural and\r\nmulti-ethnic character, and it is therefore taking important\r\ninitiatives for the advancement of indigenous peoples. The\r\nVice-President of the Republic, Victor Hugo Cárdenas, is\r\na distinguished representative of Bolivia’s Aymará people.\r\nIn the international arena, we are actively pursuing\r\npeaceful coexistence among States and trying to make\r\ninternational justice a reality.\r\nOur position is based on the principles of equal rights\r\nof States, non-intervention in internal affairs,\r\nnon-recognition of territorial acquisitions by force, respect\r\nfor human rights and the other fundamental principles of\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe support we give to intergovernmental\r\norganizations, particularly the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), reflects our\r\nconfidence in the potential of multilateral cooperation in a\r\nworld that is growing ever more complex and\r\ninterdependent.\r\nAt the regional level, we are seeking the economic\r\nintegration of Latin America and the Caribbean with the\r\naim of establishing optimal conditions for forging a\r\nhemispheric community and establishing a united presence\r\nas the world opens up and markets expand.\r\nWe are seeking the closest possible ties with countries\r\nthat share our subregional realities, and we are committed\r\nto merging the various integration processes. That policy\r\nhas prompted Bolivia to sign an agreement forming a free-\r\ntrade area with the members of the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) — Argentina, Brazil,\r\nParaguay, and Uruguay — to sign agreements aimed at\r\nupdating and reinvigorating the Andean Common Market,\r\nmade up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and\r\nVenezuela, and to give effect to numerous bilateral treaties\r\nto enhance mutual complementarity on the basis of our\r\nexperiences and the need to foster material and spiritual\r\nexchanges between nations.\r\nThe physical integration of the countries of the region\r\nconstitutes another central issue deserving priority attention.\r\nWe are working actively on the definition of inter-oceanic\r\ncorridors, and we attach great importance to the future of\r\nthe Plata Basin and the Treaty for Amazonian Cooperation.\r\nWith regard to Bolivia’s maritime question, I must\r\ninform the international community, as we have done every\r\nyear, that Bolivia has reiterated in various forums its\r\npolitical willingness to begin negotiations that take proper\r\naccount of the interests of all the parties involved and\r\nensure Bolivia’s sovereign presence with regard to the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\nNo clear willingness to engage in dialogue can yet\r\nbe seen. However, on the basis of contacts on this matter\r\nwe can say that, despite historical difficulties and\r\nultranationalist suspicions, minds are opening and\r\nobjective foundations are being laid with a view to\r\nencouraging a timely solution to old problems through the\r\nexchange of ideas, the nurturing of mutual trust, mutual\r\ninterest and hemispheric understanding, in the hope that,\r\nbefore long, brotherhood, equality, justice and the\r\nrequirements of international peace and cooperation will\r\ntruly prevail.\r\nThis year Bolivia had the honour to act as pro\r\ntempore secretariat of the Rio Group, a high-level forum\r\nof consultation and political coordination for an important\r\ngroup of Latin American and Caribbean States. In that\r\ncapacity, Bolivia was the venue of the sixth regular\r\nmeeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Rio Group\r\nand the European Union, held last April in the city of\r\nCochabamba. On that occasion we reaffirmed our\r\nreadiness for joint endeavours between Latin America, the\r\nCaribbean and Western Europe. The meeting strengthened\r\nties between the two regions, based on respect for human\r\nrights, the fundamental rights of citizens and the\r\nprinciples of democracy and political pluralism.\r\nThe Ministers highlighted, inter alia, the danger of\r\ndrugs and related problems, recognizing the importance of\r\nmaintaining political dialogue on this issue at the highest\r\nlevel and agreeing on the need to strengthen the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).\r\nThe meeting called upon the international community to\r\ndeal with the phenomenon of drugs through joint action\r\nbased on the principle of global, shared responsibility. To\r\nthat end, consideration and support were given to the\r\nproposal to hold a special session of the General\r\nAssembly in 1998 to address this crucial issue.\r\nWorldwide awareness of the need for joint action is\r\nreaching its peak, and Bolivia hopes that the proposed\r\nmeeting will lay down positive guidelines to put an end\r\nto the scourge of drugs.\r\nI am also pleased to inform representatives that on\r\n3 and 4 September 1996, again in the Bolivian city of\r\nCochabamba, the Meeting of Heads of State of the Rio\r\nGroup took place, on the occasion of the tenth\r\nanniversary of the creation of that standing body. It was\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\na great honour for my country to welcome such illustrious\r\nguests.\r\nThe Presidents and Prime Minister gathered there\r\nnoted with satisfaction that our region had made significant\r\nheadway in fighting international crime. As evidence of\r\nthis, they pointed to the signing in Caracas of the Inter-\r\nAmerican Convention against Corruption, the results of the\r\nSpecialized Inter-American Conference on Terrorism, held\r\nin Lima, and advances in the development of a hemispheric\r\nstrategy against drugs and related crimes in the framework\r\nof the Inter-American Commission against Drug Abuse.\r\nThe Heads of State and Government expressed their\r\nsatisfaction at the fact that our region had become the first\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone through the adoption of the\r\nTreaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean.\r\nThe Final Declaration of the tenth summit expressed\r\nthe joint position of the Governments of the region on the\r\nissues of representative democracy and the eradication of\r\npoverty. It placed on record their deep conviction with\r\nregard to sustainable development; it set forth precise\r\nguidelines on regional integration and trade; it expressed a\r\nfirm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and\r\nrelated crimes; it emphasized, in particular, the importance\r\nof the Inter-American Convention against Corruption; and\r\nit reiterated emphatically the crucial importance\r\nGovernments, from their position of lofty responsibility,\r\nattached to cultural integration.\r\nMy delegation has requested that the Secretariat of the\r\nUnited Nations circulate the final document of the\r\nCochabamba meeting to all delegations in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWith regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality of\r\nnational laws, a most sensitive issue for peoples and\r\nGovernments the world over, the Rio Group summit\r\nmeeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use a\r\ncountry’s domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctions\r\nof an extraterritorial character, as this contravenes the\r\nstandards governing coexistence between States, disregards\r\nthe fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and is\r\na clear violation of international law.\r\nBolivia is confident that intelligence and fairness will\r\nprevail on this delicate matter and that a solution will soon\r\nbe found, in the interest of international coexistence and\r\neconomic and commercial freedom for all peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nOne of the most outstanding international\r\ndevelopments of our time was undoubtedly the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, in\r\nRio de Janeiro in 1992.\r\nWith the aim of laying the groundwork for a\r\nhemispheric agenda for sustainable development, several\r\ninternational meetings, starting with the Summit held in\r\nMiami in 1994, have expressed support for the decision\r\nto hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads of\r\nState and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz\r\nde la Sierra, scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year.\r\nThat meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course\r\nof national and international endeavours for sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the light of economic, social and\r\nenvironmental goals and in reaffirmation of the\r\nimportance of obtaining new and additional resources to\r\nfinance the plan of action to be adopted.\r\nBolivia has offered to work its hardest alongside its\r\nsister nations to ensure the success of this major\r\nhemispheric event and is certain that inter-American\r\nsolidarity will lead to positive results.\r\nThe agenda of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly contains more than 160 items of particular\r\ninterest to the international community. My Government\r\nis prepared to participate constructively in the\r\nconsideration and resolution of each of them.\r\nWe are concerned with problems of international\r\npeace and security and trust that the United Nations\r\nsystem will contribute effectively to finding solutions for\r\nthe many parts of the world beset by conflicts and war.\r\nAs I stated on a previous occasion, Bolivia is of the\r\nview that many conflict situations can be explained by the\r\npersistence of unresolved social and national problems, as\r\nwell as by the accumulation of age-old injustices and\r\nresentments; by geopolitical and economic interests that\r\nfor decades have been fuelling confrontation from without\r\nand from within; and, above all, by Governments’\r\ninability to cooperate effectively so as to provide timely\r\nand peaceful solutions to the problems of greatest national\r\nconcern.\r\nWe have participated in the debates on reforms of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, and we believe that it is of\r\nthe utmost importance to reach consensus in order to\r\nstrengthen the multilateral system in the interests of the\r\nworld community. We support the positions set forth by\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement in this regard.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nDifficult international circumstances are making it\r\nincreasingly clear that the United Nations needs to be\r\nstrengthened, to adapt its structures and strengthen the\r\nOrganization as a legitimate forum for the study,\r\ncoordination, follow-up and implementation of universally\r\naccepted policies. Accordingly, Bolivia considers it essential\r\nto strengthen the General Assembly, the Security Council\r\nand the role of the International Court of Justice. With\r\nregard to the expansion of the Security Council, we\r\nconsider it necessary that Germany and Japan be present as\r\nnew permanent members and that three other permanent\r\nmembers from Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean be selected. The expansion should be\r\ncomplemented by an appropriate number of non-permanent\r\nmembers from the developing world. Of course, if\r\nconsensus could be reached on other formulas, then other\r\nproposals, such as the one presented by Italy, would need\r\nto be considered.\r\nWith regard to the veto, Bolivia shares the view that,\r\nideally, the international community should move towards\r\neliminating this device — and, one would hope, in the not-\r\ntoo-distant future. In the meantime, use of this device\r\nshould be strictly limited to actions relating to cases of\r\nthreats to the peace, breach of the peace or acts of\r\naggression referred to in Chapter VII of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nBolivia is greatly concerned about the political and\r\nsocial situation in many African countries. We express our\r\nsolidarity with these countries, as we did to fraternal South\r\nAfrica during its times of trial, and we urge the\r\ninternational community, especially the rich countries of the\r\nworld, to cooperate generously and resolutely in order to\r\ncope with the grave economic problems of this continent.\r\nWe also express our solidarity with our brothers in the\r\nMiddle East. We believe that the time has come to heal old\r\nwounds and frame the terms of a just and lasting peace,\r\ntaking into account the need for secure borders for all and\r\ndefinitively resolving the situation through the creation of\r\na Palestinian state. A solution must also be found to the\r\nquestions of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and the\r\nterritorial integrity and full sovereignty of all States of the\r\nregion must be preserved.\r\nWe rejoice in the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nhas embarked upon a new road to understanding, unity and\r\nconstruction of new democratic institutions.\r\nThe brotherly nations of Asia offer us remarkable\r\nexamples of the possibilities and opportunities for\r\naccelerated economic development. Their successes fill us\r\nwith confidence, and we are certain that they will apply\r\nthe same wisdom to finding solutions to the social and\r\npolitical problems that some of them still face.\r\nWe are convinced that the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty, adopted by the General Assembly on 10\r\nSeptember of this year, represents a landmark along the\r\nroad to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Bolivia\r\nhas signed the papers of accession to the new Treaty and\r\nhopes to complete the constitutional procedures for its\r\napproval and ratification in a relatively short time.\r\nWe stress just as emphatically the need to ban the\r\nuse and production of anti-personnel mines, which have\r\nbeen leaving a trail of blood among the peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe economic and social items before the Assembly\r\nalso deserve our keenest interest, since they are among\r\nthe essential tasks of the United Nations and of\r\ninternational cooperation. From our view of the\r\ninternational scene, questions pertaining to respect for\r\nhuman rights and democratic development in all countries\r\nare also matters of very high priority.\r\nAs representatives are aware, Bolivia has put\r\nforward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council for the period 1997-1998, the elections\r\nfor which will be held during the present session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAs a founding member of the United Nations,\r\nBolivia carries the principles of the Charter deep within\r\nits national spirit and has maintained a policy of\r\nrecognition of and support for this universal Organization.\r\nIn recent years my country has contributed to the forces\r\nof United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ),\r\nas well as to the election-monitoring processes in\r\nEl Salvador and Mozambique. We are also prepared to\r\nparticipate in United Nations standby arrangements. With\r\nregard to Haiti, Bolivia had the privilege of presiding over\r\nthe ad hoc group of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Organization of American States and contributed\r\npolice personnel during the first stage of the democratic\r\nnormalization of that sister nation. Bolivia intends to\r\ncontinue participating in United Nations activities to\r\nfoster international peace and cooperation.\r\nIn this regard, I am pleased to note that my country\r\nenjoys excellent, long-standing diplomatic relations with\r\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nthat it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nwhose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an\r\nexpression of steadfastness in our convictions and in\r\ncontinued political cooperation.\r\nWe share common problems with developing\r\ncountries, land-locked States and small States the world\r\nover. Our established friendship with all the countries of\r\nAmerica, Africa, Asia, Europe and Oceania has enabled us\r\nto learn from their important experiences and better to\r\nunderstand their many problems.If our brother nations\r\nrepresented here see fit to honour us with their trust,\r\nBolivia undertakes to place its particular dedication at the\r\nservice of the international community in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAs we move towards the end of the twentieth century\r\nand make preparations to welcome a new century and a\r\nnew millennium, peoples and nations cannot ignore deep-\r\nrooted trends towards new and untrodden systems of human\r\ncoexistence.\r\nIn that connection, we must ensure that small States\r\nparticipate actively in the international arena in promoting\r\nmankind’s dream of making one out of many. That can\r\noccur only if the rules of the game are clearly defined and\r\nimplemented and if effective worldwide instruments are\r\ncreated. It is here, in the existence of and respect for\r\ninternational law and justice and the institutions that\r\nembody them, that peoples, nations and States can find the\r\nonly possible lodestar to guide them. Otherwise, they will\r\nbe condemned to new and ominous forms of modern\r\nslavery. That is why Bolivia believes, today more than ever,\r\nin the validity of the United Nations and will work to the\r\nutmost to defending and strengthening it.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the next speaker, I\r\nshould like to inform the Assembly that the representative\r\nof Palau has requested to participate in the general debate.\r\nInasmuch as the list of speakers was closed on Wednesday,\r\n25 September 1996, I would ask the Assembly if there is\r\nany objection to the inclusion of that delegation in the list\r\nof speakers for the general debate? If I hear none, I shall\r\ntake it that Palau is to be included in the list of speakers.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab.\r\nMr. Gurirab (Namibia): Your election, Mr.\r\nPresident, represents a fitting tribute to you personally for\r\nyour well-known qualities as a consummate diplomat and\r\nto Malaysia for its constructive role in world affairs and\r\nremarkable success in economic development and social\r\nintegration at home.\r\nI cannot forget the skilful and decisive role you\r\nplayed as President of the Security Council, in defence of\r\nour interests, against attempts aimed at weakening the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations Transition Assistance\r\nGroup in Namibia. Our two countries have since joined\r\nhands in cooperative relations, which are growing from\r\nstrength to strength. I congratulate you and wish you\r\nevery success in your challenging task.\r\nYour Prime Minister, Mr. Mahathir Mohamad, is a\r\ngreat friend of the Namibian people. His eloquent voice\r\nilluminates the burning international issues advocated by\r\nthe South. It also serves to define most clearly the basis\r\nof South-North dialogue, as well as the vital work being\r\ndone for the developing countries by the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nYour predecessor, Mr. Diogo Feitas do Amaral,\r\nearned himself a place of honour in the annals of history\r\nby presiding over the fiftieth commemorative session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I commend him for his valuable\r\nefforts and constructive contribution.\r\nOur illustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, has been a devoted champion of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, a firm reformer and an\r\nindefatigable promoter of peace, social development and\r\npeacekeeping throughout the world. Africa holds the\r\nSecretary-General in high esteem and supports his tireless\r\nefforts in behalf of peace and a better future for\r\nhumanity, an outlook that is common to the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU), the United Nations and the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nAt the most recent OAU summit, held at Yaoundé,\r\nAfrican leaders demonstrated unity and solidarity by\r\nendorsing Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for reelection as\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. Namibia stands\r\nbehind that decision.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations was a\r\ncelebration of the success and durability of our\r\nOrganization. At the same time, it was a celebration of\r\nthe triumph of the will and determination of world leaders\r\nand citizens alike to conquer tyranny, hegemony, poverty,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nilliteracy, social inequities and underdevelopment amidst the\r\nwealth and knowledge that abound in the world.\r\nPresident Nujoma had this to say last year, from this\r\nrostrum:\r\n“During the past 50 years, this Organization has\r\nserved humanity as a universal market-place of great\r\nideas and collective action.”(Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n35th meeting, p. 10)\r\nPresident Nujoma has also said that the promotion of\r\nworld peace and security was meant to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and, moreover, to\r\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\r\nlarger freedom. These are living commitments for all\r\nnations and peoples and must be realized fully. They bind\r\nus together as members of one human race and as each\r\nother’s keepers.\r\nYou, Mr. President, issued a charge to the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly in your acceptance speech\r\non 17 September 1996. I thought its essence was\r\nencapsulated in these words, which seemed to echo what\r\nmy leader had said:\r\n“The United Nations must begin to embed itself\r\nin reality and push the critical issues, especially\r\npoverty and social injustice, to the centre of national\r\nand public debate. What will it take to do this? Of\r\nimmediate need is political will by Member States to\r\ncommit to the principles of democracy and\r\naccountability. The nature of democratic practice\r\nneeded for such an enterprise is one based on careful\r\ndeliberation and consultation so that compromise to\r\nthe lowest value is minimized in favour of optimizing\r\nthe best options that will protect universal values.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-First\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, first meeting, p. 4)\r\nI could hardly agree more with those sentiments.\r\nI shall never be convinced, and I shall never succumb\r\nto the notion, that nuclear weapons assure world peace and\r\nsecurity, development, prosperity or equality among nations.\r\nOn the contrary, I am convinced that peace, disarmament,\r\ndemocracy, multilateral cooperation and resource allocation\r\ncan unleash human ingenuity and industry for development\r\nand social progress.\r\nIt is for these reasons that Namibia insists on\r\ncomplete nuclear disarmament in all respects. The other\r\nday I signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\non behalf of the Republic of Namibia, not out of\r\ncomplete satisfaction but to encourage the ongoing work\r\ntowards disarmament, bearing in mind the constructive\r\nand timely advisory opinion of the International Court of\r\nJustice on nuclear weapons, as well as the Treaties of\r\nPelindaba, Rarotonga and Tlatelolco, which created\r\nnuclear-free zones in Africa, the South Pacific and Latin\r\nAmerica respectively.\r\nAfrica is bleeding, just as the souls of our people,\r\nthe African people, are burning in misery and mayhem.\r\nTheir precious humanity and lives have been denuded of\r\ndignity and worth. How long must this carnage and\r\ndehumanization be allowed to continue in Somalia,\r\nBurundi and other tormented places in Africa?\r\nThe glimmer of hope in Liberia engendered by the\r\nrecently concluded peace accord, brokered by States\r\nmembers of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), and the inauguration of Mrs. Ruth\r\nPerry as the first-ever woman Head of State in Africa,\r\nmust not be snatched away again by unscrupulous power-\r\ngrabbers and political opportunists. Rather, the newly\r\ninaugurated Head of State must be given all the support\r\nshe needs to pursue a national course of democratization,\r\nreconciliation and reconstruction for all Liberians.\r\nThe long-standing partnership and cooperation\r\nbetween the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nthe United Nations should be brought to bear in the\r\nemerging favourable situation in Liberia with a view to\r\nstabilizing the transition and to preventing any military\r\nreversals. Just as peacekeeping cannot be successful\r\nwithout international involvement, so also do regional\r\npost-conflict peace-building and reconstruction depend on\r\ninternational support to be successful. It is here where\r\npreventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacemaking\r\ncome together to do good for all.\r\nMr. Salim Ahmed Salim, the very able and\r\nhardworking Secretary-General of the OAU, is anxious to\r\napply in all those conflict situations, the Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. But he\r\nis short of resources, including personnel, as well as of\r\nappropriate capacity to do the job. Namibia will continue\r\nto make its contribution in spite of its limited means. We\r\nurge the international community to render generous\r\nassistance to the OAU for this purpose.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nDrug trafficking is a horrendous killer disease which\r\npermeates the social fabric of society. Drug lords are\r\nnotorious gangsters not unlike those responsible for\r\norganized crime, with corrupting inroads into Governments,\r\nbusinesses and civil society, targeting youth, students and\r\neven small children. The member States of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) recently signed\r\na protocol on drug trafficking in our region and agreed to\r\ncoordinate their law enforcement efforts to combat this\r\nmenace jointly.\r\nToday, the risk of dying due to anti-personnel\r\nlandmines in many parts of the world has increased\r\nastronomically. This risk exists in southern Africa as well,\r\nmainly in Angola, but also in Mozambique and Namibia.\r\nThis is another area in which SADC is combining the\r\nefforts of its members with a view to regional initiatives.\r\nCooperation between SADC and the European Union\r\nhas made it possible for us to benefit from resources and\r\nexpertise to deal more effectively with this very serious\r\nproblem. That is why Namibia welcomes the initiative\r\ntaken on this matter by my colleague, Mr. Klaus Kinkel,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of\r\nGermany, and supports his Seven-Point-Action Programme\r\non Anti-Personnel Mines.\r\nIn this connection, we encourage other ongoing\r\ninitiatives aimed at banning anti-personnel landmines, as\r\nwell as the commendable work which some countries are\r\ndoing in the field of demining, including in Namibia.\r\nNamibia therefore supports the inclusion of a ban on\r\nanti-personnel landmines in the agenda of the forthcoming\r\nsession of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.\r\nIn the interest of democratization and national\r\nreconciliation, and in order to mitigate the existing harsh\r\nand racially biased social disparities which we inherited\r\nfrom the apartheid order, Namibia has been pleading with\r\nthe United Nations and the rest of the international\r\ncommunity for least-developed country status. So far, this\r\nplea has remained unheeded in the main, but, to be fair, not\r\nentirely. While renewing our plea, it is worth\r\nacknowledging with appreciation the implementation of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 46/204, concerning “as if”\r\nleast-developed country status, which has aided Namibia in\r\nsome constructive ways. This was made possible by United\r\nNations Member States, as well as by specialized agencies.\r\nWe thank them all for their support and also for having\r\nextended the “as if” least-developed status for an additional\r\nthree years.\r\nWe believe, as most do, that economic growth, job\r\ncreation, human resource development and gender\r\nequality must be visible and qualitative in content as\r\ncritical weapons against social dislocations and strife.\r\nWithout exception, during last year’s fiftieth\r\nanniversary commemoration of the founding of the United\r\nNations, world leaders dealt, one way or another, with the\r\ndemocratization, restructuring and revitalization of the\r\nUnited Nations. This was as it ought to be. Systemic\r\nreform of the United Nations was already overdue\r\ndecades ago.\r\nWhile the reform process itself is still very much on\r\ncourse, its forward momentum seems to have been\r\ndeflected for one reason or another.\r\nThe common position shared by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nother fair-minded bodies and persons is based on the\r\nprinciple of equitable representation and transparency in\r\nterms of decision-making at all levels of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn this context, Africa, Asia and Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean each deserve to be allocated at least two\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council, as well as a\r\nconcomitant increase of non-permanent seats in the spirit\r\nof democracy and fairness. Namibia has already expressed\r\non a number of occasions a position on the addition of\r\nJapan and Germany as permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, but not in isolation of the representation\r\nenvisaged for the aforementioned three continents.\r\nAt the same time, Namibia believes that the General\r\nAssembly was not meant by the authors of the United\r\nNations Charter to play second fiddle to any of the other\r\nprincipal organs. It is a universal parliament of equal\r\nmembers with the same preoccupation for world peace\r\nand security, as well as for human survival and\r\nprosperity.\r\nIt stands to reason, therefore, that United Nations\r\nreform must not end up by making the Assembly a rubber\r\nstamp of other principal organs, be it the Security Council\r\nor the Economic and Social Council. We should like, in\r\nthe end, to see well-balanced and mutually\r\ncomplementary organs and institutions of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nMultilateralism is the essence of the United Nations\r\nsystem. Decisions taken by the majority of Member States\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nshould not be changed in the interest of a few through\r\nadministrative fiat. It is for the General Assembly itself, if\r\nneed be, to reconsider or to change any programme\r\nactivities or personnel requirements approved previously.\r\nIn addition to reaffirming their continued commitment\r\nto and strengthening, of South-South cooperation, the\r\nmember States of the Group of 77 and China, in their latest\r\nreport, renewed their call for a just and predictable\r\nmultilateral trading system that would ensure the complete\r\nintegration of the economies of the South into the world\r\neconomy and the emerging international trading system.\r\nTo this end, the South attaches great importance to the\r\nfirst Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, to be held in Singapore in December 1996.\r\nNamibia strongly supports this meeting.\r\nThe 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and the\r\nestablishment of the Palestinian Authority raised hopes for\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East. Regrettably, bloodshed\r\nand enmity are once again threatening to derail the Middle\r\nEast peace process.\r\nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat cannot\r\nafford to waste one more minute. An urgent one-on-one\r\nmeeting and joint action, which ought to be routine, to end\r\nthe vicious circle of violence should take place without\r\ndelay. The first step in this direction is putting an\r\nimmediate end to the creation of new settlements and to the\r\nreconstruction work in the Old City of Jerusalem. The\r\ninitiators as well as the supporters of the Madrid peace\r\nprocess should also bring their weight to bear towards\r\nrestoring the partnership for a comprehensive, just and\r\nlasting settlement, in the best interest of all parties in the\r\nMiddle East, especially in the exercise of self-determination\r\nby the Palestinians and the establishment of an independent\r\nstate of their own.\r\nAnd, of course, we are not forgetting Bosnia. Namibia\r\nhopes that the progress achieved so far will continue and\r\nwill eventually lead to lasting peace and reconciliation in\r\nthe area.\r\nNamibia cannot have a split personality on the\r\nquestion of self-determination and decolonization. Western\r\nSahara is crying out for self-determination and\r\ndecolonization. Only when these goals are fully realized can\r\nAfrica and the United Nations boast of the complete\r\npolitical emancipation of our beloved continent.\r\nNamibia welcomes the high-level contacts that the\r\nKingdom of Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic\r\nRepublic (SADR) have commenced. I should like to\r\nentreat them to maintain and invigorate these encouraging\r\npolitical talks. The objective we would all like to see\r\nimplemented, I believe, is the early holding of a United\r\nNations-sponsored referendum in which only the authentic\r\nSaharawis will be able to express their unfettered will and\r\nassume their destiny.\r\nThere is an extensive update on Angola in the\r\nSecretary-General’s annual report. In his important\r\nstatement of 23 September 1996 to this Assembly, my\r\ncolleague, Venancio de Moura, Foreign Minister of\r\nAngola, provided representatives with useful additional\r\ninformation on the worrisome situation in his country,\r\ninclusive of constitutional and political issues.\r\nI can hardly add to this information. For Namibia,\r\nnonetheless, the suffering of our Angolan brothers and\r\nsisters, not to mention the children, is of paramount\r\nconcern. The other concern we have in Namibia is about\r\nthe fast-approaching deadline of the presence of the\r\nUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission\r\n(UNAVEM III) in Angola, which includes financial\r\nimplications arising out of the obstacles and delays which\r\nkeep cropping up in the implementation of the Lusaka\r\nProtocol. Be that as it may, Namibia is bound by blood\r\nand common destiny to stand with Angola. That is why\r\nour military contingent attached to UNAVEM III will\r\nremain in Angola until the Mission is satisfactorily\r\nconcluded.\r\nThis week, the leaders of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community Organ on Politics, Defence and\r\nSecurity, under the co-chairmanship of President Robert\r\nMugabe, will meet in Luanda to exchange views on the\r\ncritical situation in Angola and its implications for the\r\nregion, the United Nations and the world at large.\r\nPresident Nujoma will attend this crucial and timely\r\nmeeting.\r\nBefore concluding, let me say that an enduring\r\nchallenge for the United Nations, now and into the next\r\ncentury, is to reactivate multilateralism as the centrepiece\r\nof international relations and constructive cooperation in\r\nthe emerging world order.\r\nThis new world order cannot be built with a cold\r\nwar mind-set characterized by confrontation, military\r\nintervention, economic blockade and political\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nassassinations. There is no place for it in today’s world of\r\ncooperation and open trade.\r\nThe General Assembly, where all United Nations\r\nMember States are represented, is the ideal forum for\r\nresolving the conflicts of interest of the haves and the\r\nhave-nots, guided by the principles of equality, justice and\r\nequity for all.\r\nFinally, let me end with President Nujoma’s\r\nconcluding words, spoken here last year:\r\n“The future belongs to the youth and children.\r\nOur collective duty must be to reinforce their\r\nvision for a peaceful, harmonious and prosperous\r\nfuture in the spirit of brotherhood and\r\ncooperation”. (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n35th meeting, p. 10)\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Indonesia, His Excellency Mr. Ali Alatas.\r\nMr. Alatas (Indonesia): It is with great pleasure that\r\nI extend my delegation’s heartfelt congratulations to you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. We are deeply gratified\r\nto see an eminent representative of a brotherly neighbouring\r\ncountry and fellow member of the Association of South-\r\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) preside over our sessions.\r\nYour election to this high office is also a well-deserved\r\nrecognition of your personal qualities and professional\r\naccomplishments, as well as of the role and stature of\r\nMalaysia in regional and global affairs.\r\nMay I also extend our felicitations to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, for\r\nso ably presiding over the historic fiftieth session.\r\nLet me avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute\r\nto Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his many\r\naccomplishments, his untiring efforts in the cause of peace\r\nand development and the sagacity with which he is steering\r\nthe Organization during these challenging times.\r\nDuring the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations last year, we noted a resurgence of\r\nhope and optimism in the international community as we\r\nreviewed the achievements of the world Organization, made\r\nin spite of the many constraints with which it has been\r\nsaddled. We renewed our determination to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations and rededicated ourselves to the vision of\r\nworld peace that inspired its founding, as well as to the\r\nideals and principles enshrined in its Charter. That act of\r\nrededication was timely and necessary. For, since the\r\ndemise of the cold war, the world has been in the grip of\r\nmassive changes that have given rise to new challenges\r\nand contradictory trends in international relations. At the\r\nsame time, new vistas have emerged and a deepening\r\nsense of interdependence has prompted nations to devise\r\nmore realistic and more mutually beneficial patterns of\r\ncooperation.\r\nYet, while these developments have revived\r\nexpectations of a more peaceful and secure world, the\r\nacute reality is that our planet is still far from being a\r\npeaceful place. Violent conflicts continue to embroil many\r\nregions of the globe. Nation States and international\r\ninstitutions are frantically struggling to adjust to\r\ndrastically changed and changing political and economic\r\ncircumstances. Weapons of mass destruction still pose a\r\npotent threat of worldwide catastrophe. In view of all\r\nthese, it is no wonder that, after a momentary resurgence\r\nof hope, we are again being overtaken by a sense of\r\nfrustration and common vulnerability.\r\nThe primordial challenge of our time, therefore, is to\r\ndevise a more effective system of global governance in\r\norder to manage the demands and the vicissitudes of\r\nglobalization and interdependence. As emphasized in a\r\nstatement recently issued by 16 Heads of State or\r\nGovernment, including the President of Indonesia, nations\r\nshould rise from their immediate concerns, focus on their\r\ncommon long-term interests and break new ground.\r\nConstructive initiatives are needed, and multilateralism\r\nhas to be reasserted and strengthened.\r\nNot even global cooperation, however, can meet the\r\nneeds and expectations of people without a stronger\r\nUnited Nations to give coherence to such cooperation.\r\nWorld governance, therefore, in order to be effective and\r\nacceptable to all, must be fashioned with the United\r\nNations as its principal mechanism and source of\r\nlegitimacy. The revitalization of this international\r\ninstitution through a comprehensive process of\r\nrestructuring and democratization of its major organs and\r\nfunctions has therefore become imperative.\r\nIt is of pivotal importance that the General\r\nAssembly, the highest deliberative and decision-making\r\norgan within the United Nations system, should function\r\neffectively. Indeed, strengthening the role of the General\r\nAssembly is a basic premise of the current process of\r\nUnited Nations reform and revitalization.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nJust as crucial is the reform of the Security Council so\r\nas to allow it to reflect contemporary realities and to\r\naccommodate the interests and concerns of developing\r\ncountries, which comprise the overwhelming majority of the\r\nOrganization. It is an anachronism and a gross anomaly that\r\nEurope is overrepresented, Asia underrepresented and\r\nAfrica and Latin America not represented at all on the\r\nCouncil’s roster of permanent members. In our view, new\r\npermanent members should be chosen on the basis not only\r\nof equitable geographic representation, but also of such\r\ncriteria as political, economic and demographic weight,\r\ntheir capability and proven track record of contributing to\r\nthe promotion of peace, security and development, both\r\nregionally and globally, and their commitment to assuming\r\nresponsibilities inherent to permanent membership.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council is now being\r\nrevitalized so that it will have a more dynamic relationship\r\nwith the General Assembly and other United Nations\r\nbodies. Yet, regrettably, it is still unable effectively to fulfil\r\nits crucial role, notably in helping United Nations Members\r\nadjust to the complex demands of globalization. The\r\nreforms and adjustments that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil is undergoing should be further strengthened to\r\nenhance its cooperation not only with other United Nations\r\nbodies but also with such important international agencies\r\nas the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nAll these efforts to revitalize, reform and democratize\r\nthe United Nations, however, will come to naught if in the\r\nend the United Nations is paralysed by financial insolvency.\r\nIf the current financial plight of the United Nations\r\ncontinues — and it will continue as long as certain major\r\nMember States refuse to remit their legally-obligated\r\ncontributions — there is a real danger that peacekeeping\r\noperations will collapse and many endeavours to maintain\r\npeace and security will be compromised. The very\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations itself could be severely\r\nundermined and the purposes of the reform process\r\nseriously jeopardized. No organization can be reformed by\r\nstarving it. Ironically, the countries that are pressing the\r\nhardest for cutbacks and reforms have themselves refused\r\nto finance the new austerity budget. For more than five\r\ndecades the United Nations and related institutions have\r\nbeen engaged in an immense array of activities that touch\r\nevery aspect of people’s lives all over the world. If those\r\nvital statistics, too, must be terminated because of the\r\nOrganization’s insolvency, that would constitute an\r\nenormous human tragedy.\r\nNuclear arsenals of enormously destructive power\r\ncontinue to pose a threat to all life on Earth. We believe\r\nthat the time has come for the Conference on\r\nDisarmament to establish a special committee for\r\nnegotiations on a programme of nuclear disarmament and\r\nthe ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons within a\r\ndefinite time-frame. In this regard, it is my hope that the\r\nrecent Advisory Opinion of the International Court of\r\nJustice on the illegality of the threat or use of nuclear\r\nweapons will serve as a catalyst towards this end.\r\nThe 10 countries of South-East Asia recently made\r\na substantive contribution to the cause of nuclear\r\ndisarmament. During the historic Bangkok summit of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the\r\nseven ASEAN leaders, together with the leaders of Laos,\r\nCambodia and Myanmar, signed the Treaty on the South-\r\nEast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. ASEAN is now\r\nworking for the Treaty’s early entry into force. We hope\r\nthat the nuclear Powers will soon endorse the Treaty by\r\nacceding to its Protocol. Thus, with the conclusion of\r\nTreaties for nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia\r\nand Africa, in addition to the Antarctic, Rarotonga and\r\nTlatelolco Treaties, a large segment of the southern\r\nhemisphere should become free of the nuclear menace. As\r\nfor chemical weapons, I am pleased to inform the General\r\nAssembly that Indonesia is now at the final stage of the\r\nprocess of ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nAnother positive development was the signing a few\r\ndays ago of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) after two and a half years of arduous negotiations\r\nin the Conference on Disarmament. Indeed, for the past\r\nthree decades, the international community unceasingly\r\nstressed the need for such a treaty in an endeavour to\r\nstem the horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. The Treaty outlaws nuclear-test explosions by\r\nall States in all environments for all time, ensures that the\r\nban is effective and verifiable and provides new ground\r\nfor the realization of the objectives set by the 1995\r\nReview and Extension Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nHaving become a reality through broad\r\ncompromises, however, the Treaty is still a far cry from\r\nthe CTBT long-envisioned by the international\r\ncommunity. It still allows the most sophisticated form of\r\nnuclear-weapon testing: simulation. In a strict sense,\r\ntherefore, it is not truly comprehensive, nor does it\r\ndirectly address the issue of nuclear disarmament. But it\r\ndoes limit the nuclear-arms race by making it more\r\ndifficult for countries to develop or improve their\r\narsenals. Moreover, humankind cannot afford to dispense\r\nwith the CTBT, imperfect as it may be. Our collective\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nexperience in the disarmament endeavour has been that, if\r\nwe pass over an existing opportunity in favour of a better\r\none that is yet to be, we suffer a costly delay and possibly\r\nan irretrievable setback. Having signed the Treaty on that\r\nbasis, Indonesia fervently hopes that it will eventually be\r\nsupported by the entire membership and thereby become an\r\neffective instrument to enable us to move towards the total\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nFocal points of conflict still persist in many parts of\r\nthe globe. In the Middle East, the peace process is on the\r\nverge of collapse as a highly volatile and explosive\r\nsituation in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories threatens\r\nonce more to engulf the region in all-too-familiar violence\r\nand bloodshed, which we had hoped had become part of the\r\npast. Israel’s provocative action of opening a new entrance\r\nto the tunnel along the Western Wall of the Al-Aqsa\r\nMosque has triggered a violent confrontation, resulting in\r\ndeath and injuries to scores of civilians. Further aggravating\r\nthe situation is the unprecedented armed clash between the\r\nIsraeli army and the Palestinian police. These are but the\r\nlatest manifestations of a rapid deterioration of the situation\r\ndue to Israel’s reneging on its previous commitments and\r\nits blatant backtracking on its obligations under the 1993\r\nDeclaration of Principles and subsequent agreements.\r\nIsrael must be prevailed upon to honour the\r\nDeclaration of Principles and its subsequent agreements and\r\nto resume negotiations in earnest on the remaining issues\r\nand the final status of the occupied territories, including\r\nJerusalem. Once again, we emphasize that progress on the\r\nIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks of the\r\nnegotiations, attended by unconditional withdrawal of Israel\r\nfrom the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon,\r\nconstitutes a conditio sine qua non for comprehensive and\r\nlasting peace in the region.\r\nThe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, made\r\npossible by the cessation of hostilities as a result of the\r\nDayton and Paris peace Agreements, have brought the\r\ncountry nearer to reconciliation and paved the way for the\r\ncreation of durable national institutions.\r\nHowever, we are concerned that, especially in the\r\nSerb-held areas, the results of the election may lead to the\r\nlegitimizing of ethnic separation. It is therefore incumbent\r\nupon the international community to ensure the unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a\r\nmulticultural, multi-ethnic and multireligious society. For\r\nthe peace Agreement to be implementable, obstructions to\r\nfreedom of movement must be removed and refugees\r\nallowed freely to return to their homes. Bosnian Serb\r\nleaders must yield their illicit control over segments of\r\nthe population and territory of the country. The parties to\r\nthe peace Agreement must ensure that those indicted by\r\nthe International Tribunal are brought to justice.\r\nIn the Gulf region, we have recently witnessed\r\nunilateral military action by extraregional Powers\r\ninterfering with the internal affairs of a Member State of\r\nthe United Nations. My delegation wishes to reiterate its\r\nfirm commitment to the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of States, in this case Iraq. Actions that are\r\ninconsistent with these basic norms and principles of\r\ninter-State relations, which are enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter, are clearly unacceptable. I should also\r\nlike to seize this occasion to urge Iraq to comply fully\r\nwith all relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nEarlier this month, almost a quarter of a century of\r\nconflict in the southern Philippines came to a peaceful\r\nend with the signing of a peace agreement between the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of the Philippines and the\r\nMoro National Liberation Front, with Indonesia serving\r\nas facilitator on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference Ministerial Committee of the Six. This\r\npositive development, which will bring peace and\r\nprosperity to the southern Philippines, also constitutes\r\nanother important step towards the realization of a\r\npolitically stable, socially cohesive and economically\r\nprogressive South-East Asia that is increasingly able to\r\ndeal with its own problems in its own way.\r\nWe are now living in an era of globalization and\r\ninterdependence, an era replete with challenges but also\r\nfull of promise. How it came about is no mystery. It had\r\nbeen creeping up on us for quite some time, the\r\nconsequence of rapid advances in science and technology,\r\nparticularly in communications and transport. The end of\r\nthe cold war and the dismantling of the barriers of bloc\r\npolitics and ideological contention unleashed the full force\r\nof globalization. Since then, global trade and production\r\nhave been boosted to new heights while goods, people\r\nand capital are moving from one country to another more\r\nfreely than ever. Globalization has thus raised the hopes\r\nof humankind with visions of a new world of\r\nopportunities and more equitable prosperity.\r\nThese hopes are not without foundation. In a global\r\neconomy that is gradually recovering from recession, the\r\ndeveloped countries, according to the 1996 Economic and\r\nSocial Survey, have shown average gross-national-product\r\ngrowth rates of two per cent. The developing countries\r\nhave registered a significant 6 per cent growth while the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\neconomic dynamos of East and South-East Asia have been\r\ncredited with a stunning 8 per cent growth. These are the\r\ntrade-driven economies that have benefited most from\r\nglobalization.\r\nYet, the apprehensions about globalization are equally\r\njustified. In an external environment over which developing\r\ncountries have very little control, globalization could widen\r\nthe prosperity gap between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries. The fact that globalization can also\r\nlead to disaster was demonstrated not too long ago when\r\nthe global operations of financial markets led to instability\r\nand volatility that sent shock waves through the monetary\r\nsystems of developing countries. In their efforts to integrate\r\nthemselves into the global economy, many developing\r\ncountries have found it necessary to make structural\r\nadjustments that too often entail exorbitant social and\r\nhuman costs. Moreover, globalization has not mitigated and\r\nmay have, on the contrary, exacerbated the inequities and\r\nimbalances in international economic relations. Bereft of a\r\nfavourable external environment for their national\r\ndevelopment efforts, many developing countries continue to\r\nlanguish in poverty, backwardness, stagnation and even\r\nnegative economic growth. Every year, 13 to 18 million\r\npeople, mostly children in developing countries, die from\r\nhunger and poverty-related causes. Meanwhile, the\r\ndeveloping countries remain marginalized from the\r\ninternational decision-making processes that would fashion\r\nglobal solutions to the global economic problems that afflict\r\nthem.\r\nThe poignant experience of the past three and a half\r\ndecades teaches us that these problems cannot be solved\r\nthrough palliatives and piecemeal reforms. Since the major\r\nproblems of development are global in nature, they can\r\nonly be effectively dealt with through a new global\r\npartnership for development involving all countries, of both\r\nthe developed North and the developing South, on the basis\r\nof mutual interest and equitable sharing of benefits and\r\nresponsibility.\r\nIt has been more than two years since the successful\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations, but the promise of an equitable, transparent\r\nand rule-based multilateral trading system, as embodied in\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), has yet to be\r\nrealized. Moreover, we are alarmed at the tendency of some\r\ndeveloped countries to resort to a new form of\r\nprotectionism in the guise of linking labour standards and\r\nother social and environmental concerns to trade. Such\r\nefforts will not only harm the developing countries, but will\r\nalso ultimately debilitate the WTO itself. We therefore call\r\nupon all trading partners to refrain from overloading the\r\nagenda of the first Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in\r\nSingapore this coming December with issues extraneous\r\nto trade. Let us together nurture the WTO as the guardian\r\nof a predictable, non-discriminatory multilateral trading\r\nsystem and the guarantor of the rights of the weaker\r\ntrading partner against unilateral and arbitrary actions by\r\nthe strong.\r\nIn this context, we share the concern expressed by\r\nthe international community at the practice of some\r\ncountries of promulgating national laws with\r\nextraterritorial application that adversely impact on the\r\nlegitimate interests of other countries. We cannot accept\r\nthe imposition of the law of the strong in place of\r\ndialogue and negotiation. No one country, no matter how\r\npowerful, should be allowed unilaterally to regulate the\r\nlives of other sovereign countries.\r\nThe biggest single deterrent to development in many\r\nof the world’s poorest countries is the crushing effect of\r\ntheir debt burdens. Indonesia has long advocated a set of\r\nprinciples for managing the debt problem, calling for a\r\n“once-and-for-all” settlement of the debt problems of\r\ndeveloping countries, including multilateral debts, as well\r\nas the cancellation of the debts of the most severely\r\naffected, low-income developing countries. In this context,\r\nwe welcome and support the joint proposal of the World\r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which\r\noffers effective alternatives for reducing the overall debt\r\nburdens of heavily indebted poor countries to sustainable\r\nlevels. While this initiative could be further refined, it is\r\nIndonesia’s fervent hope that, at the forthcoming meetings\r\nof the World Bank and the IMF, this proposal will finally\r\nreceive the support that it needs and deserves from the\r\ndeveloped countries. In this context, I am encouraged by\r\nthe developments at the IMF meetings in Washington\r\ntoday.\r\nSocial development and social justice remain elusive\r\ndreams for millions of impoverished people throughout\r\nthe world. Indonesia shares that dream and abides by the\r\ncommitments it assumed at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing, both of which were\r\nheld last year. We have indeed dedicated ...\r\nMr. Turnquest (Bahamas), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe have, indeed, dedicated ourselves to the\r\nproposition that people should not only be the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nbeneficiaries of development but should also be given every\r\nopportunity to become the authors of their own\r\ndevelopment. At the same time we should address, through\r\nconcrete and concerted international action, the problem of\r\nthe global trade in illicit drugs and other forms of\r\ntransnational crime. Above all, we must continue to address\r\nthe problems of poverty and underdevelopment, and we\r\nmust commit ourselves fully to genuine partnership.\r\nThis century that is about to end will perhaps be\r\nremembered for both the cruelty of its wars and the\r\ntremendous achievements that it has seen in science and\r\ntechnology — although it is not for these achievements that\r\nwe should be proud of it. To my mind, what makes this\r\ncentury special is the fact that during this time the human\r\nrace truly began to nurture the idea that poverty is not an\r\ninevitable part of the human condition, but that it can be\r\nconquered and wiped off the face of the Earth. We have the\r\nnatural resources and the mental and organizational capacity\r\nto succeed at that task. The question has always been\r\nwhether we have the political will to do it, and whether we\r\nare concerned and enlightened enough to form an equitable\r\nglobal partnership for development — for a concerted\r\nstruggle against poverty that will give a deeper and brighter\r\nmeaning to globalization and interdependence. The answer,\r\nI believe, is largely in the hands of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Benin, His Excellency\r\nMr. Pierre Osho.\r\nMr. Osho (Benin) (interpretation from French): Like\r\nthe speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum, I wish\r\nto extend to you, Sir, the warm and sincere congratulations\r\nof the delegation of Benin to the President on his\r\nunanimous selection to preside over the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. This choice\r\nconstitutes clear recognition of his exceptional personal\r\nqualities and his wealth of experience as a seasoned\r\ndiplomat, and it is a collective tribute to his beautiful\r\ncountry, Malaysia, whose dynamism and outstanding\r\neconomic success over the past few years I salute. From the\r\nrostrum of this Assembly, I should like to make a\r\ncontribution to this important session by expressing a\r\nmessage of peace, solidarity, faith and hope from the\r\npeople and the Government of Benin.\r\nA year ago, in this very Hall, in commemoration of its\r\nfiftieth anniversary, the United Nations hosted the greatest\r\ngathering of Heads of State in history. In this setting they\r\ncarried out a critical, objective and unsparing assessment of\r\nthe 50 years of the Organization’s existence, a period\r\nduring which international cooperation made it possible to\r\nachieve significant progress on each of the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter. In the Declaration they adopted,\r\nthe Heads of State and Government solemnly reaffirmed\r\ntheir dedication to the great ideals of peace, development\r\nand democracy inscribed in the founding texts of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nGiven this commitment by world leaders on the\r\nthreshold of a new millennium, the imperative of peace\r\nmust, more than ever, remain the ultimate goal of the\r\ninternational community as a whole. This is all the more\r\nurgent because, despite the end of the cold war, the peace\r\nand security of nations seem far from being fully assured.\r\nIndeed, in many respects, on the political and security\r\nlevel the international situation remains worrying,\r\nespecially on the African continent, where the course of\r\nhistory too often bears the imprint of tragic events to\r\nwhich the international community cannot remain\r\nindifferent.\r\nThe resurgence of conflicts which, for the most part,\r\nno longer take place between States but within nations, is\r\na challenge for which the Organization must adopt new\r\nmethods and machinery for intervention and settlement.\r\nThis means, therefore, that to be able to promote\r\nharmonious relations among the peoples of the world and\r\nto guarantee a lasting peace, our shared Organization\r\nmust strengthen its capabilities and its means in conflict\r\nprevention, peacekeeping and the consolidation of peace.\r\nIt cannot be stressed enough that, despite the difficulties,\r\ninadequacies and gaps that reduce or restrict the scope\r\nand effectiveness of its actions, the United Nations\r\nrepresents, embodies and remains — today and, doubtless,\r\nfor a long time to come — the body that can best express\r\nand bring to a successful conclusion the will of Member\r\nStates to work for the consolidation of peace and the\r\npursuit of economic and social progress.\r\nDespite the new international situation that promotes\r\nless aggressive, less suspicious and less tense relations\r\nbetween States, the political instability that continues to\r\nexist in certain parts of Africa, and the conflicts that\r\ndevelop there, have become significant barriers to the\r\neconomic recovery and social cohesion of the continent.\r\nIn this context, I wish to refer to the very worrying\r\nsituation in Burundi, where the unjust system of socio-\r\nethnic relations, military intransigence and political\r\nintolerance pointlessly prolong the suffering and division\r\nof a people. It is deplorable that on 25 July 1996 a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nmilitary coup ended, by force, Burundi’s constitutional,\r\ndemocratic and legal institutions.\r\nMy country, Benin, welcomes the strong and\r\ncourageous reaction of the countries of the subregion and\r\nencourages their efforts for a peaceful, just and lasting\r\nsettlement of the crisis in Burundi.\r\nBenin supports the efforts of the Heads of State of\r\ncountries of the Great Lakes region and of the Organization\r\nof African Unity to make the new authorities in Burundi\r\nquickly embark on negotiations and abide by decisions\r\nwhich should result from constructive and sound concerted\r\naction on the part of the healthy forces of this battered\r\npeople. The various protagonists must understand that only\r\na new political agreement, based on ordinary common\r\nsense, with respect for the intangible principles of\r\ndemocracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms, will\r\ncontribute to an acceptable solution to all.\r\nRegarding the situation in Liberia, the summit meeting\r\nof the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), held on 17\r\nAugust 1996, took important decisions to extend the Abuja\r\nAgreements of 1995, which are rightly considered to be the\r\nappropriate legal framework for a definitive settlement of\r\nthe conflict. This last Abuja summit also drew up a new\r\ntimetable for the implementation of the peace process, and\r\ndefined the modalities and stages to lead to democratic\r\nelections. Benin urgently demands that the Liberian factions\r\ntake advantage of this last opportunity and strictly abide by\r\nthe Abuja decisions, in order to speed up the return of their\r\ncountry to normality.\r\nMy country also invites the international community\r\nto support the efforts of ECOWAS by stepping up its\r\nfinancial and logistical assistance for the successful\r\nimplementation of the Abuja decisions.\r\nThe most important thing for a nation in crisis is the\r\nsearch for compromise to settle internal contradictions, no\r\nmatter how serious they are. This truth has been tried and\r\ntested elsewhere, in Mozambique for example, and\r\nrecently in Angola, the results of which we note with\r\nsatisfaction. Hence the appeal which I am renewing here,\r\nbefore this Assembly, for sincere dialogue in Rwanda,\r\nSomalia, the Sudan, Sierra Leone, the Middle East — in\r\na word, wherever passions continue at the end of the\r\ntwentieth century to cloud reason and block the genuine\r\nstruggle for development and democracy.\r\nEveryone agrees that peace, if it is to be genuine and\r\nlasting, must be based on general and complete\r\ndisarmament under international control. Here, I should\r\nlike to say how gratified Benin is at the signature of the\r\nPelindaba Treaty for the establishment of an African\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nThe Review and Extension Conference of the Parties\r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), held from 17 April to 12 May 1995,\r\ndecided to renew the Treaty indefinitely, thus opening the\r\nway to better prospects in the area of nuclear\r\ndisarmament. Benin, which has worked for this, believes\r\nin the strengthening of the provisions of the Treaty, in\r\nparticular regarding the verification regime, in order to\r\nmake it a genuine international instrument for effective\r\nnuclear disarmament and a solid basis for more fruitful\r\ninternational cooperation in the area of the use of nuclear\r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes.\r\nWhile the commitment to non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament has been gaining ground throughout the\r\nglobe, the resumption or continuation of nuclear tests\r\npainfully reminded us of the dangers and horrors which\r\nhaunted the collective psyche of nations during the cold-\r\nwar period. This is why Benin can only welcome the\r\npositive decision taken by France and recently by the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China to put an end to their nuclear\r\ntesting programmes.\r\nThe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty during the present session will most certainly mark\r\na major stage in the achievement of an objective which is\r\ndecisive, even vital, for the international community: that\r\nof disarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nAs we can read in the Declaration on the Occasion\r\nof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\n“action to ensure peace, security and stability in the\r\nworld will be futile unless the economic and social\r\nneeds of people are addressed.” (resolution 50/6, para.\r\n1)\r\nThis means that peace comes to nothing if the imperative\r\nof development is not guaranteed. Here, it is important to\r\nemphasize that many countries in Africa have made\r\nconsiderable progress in the key areas of protecting mothers\r\nand their children, of health, of nutrition and of education,\r\nbut, from one end of the continent to the other, gains\r\ncontinue to be drastically limited as a result of endemic\r\npoverty and economic regression.\r\nRecent developments in the global economy and the\r\nserious obstacles encountered by the efforts of the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least-developed\r\ncountries, are a cause of profound concern for us as\r\nAfricans.\r\nThe accelerated globalization of the rules and practices\r\nof the system of market economies has led to the\r\nemergence of a new economic order within which Africa,\r\nfor the most part, remains marginalized. The agreements of\r\nthe Uruguay Round concluded in 1994, the rapid\r\nredefinition of economic groupings in the developed\r\ncountries, and the ever more important role of private\r\ncapital in the world economy, have created a new\r\ninternational environment in which the interests of Africa\r\ndo not seem to have been taken into account, or in which\r\nthey are even threatened or compromised.\r\nWhile it is true that socio-economic development in\r\nAfrica is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and\r\nGovernments of the African countries themselves, it none\r\nthe less remains true that the international community, in\r\nparticular its most developed and industrialized members,\r\nmust do their part, a part commensurate with their true\r\nmeans, in the development process of a continent involved\r\nin a dual economic and political transition.\r\nAt a time when one has reason to fear the resurgence\r\nof national selfishness, the temptations of protectionism and\r\nof isolationism, the international community should provide\r\na clear response, a concrete solution that can be rapidly\r\napplied to the problems experienced by the developing\r\nworld, in particular Africa. These well-known problems\r\ninclude the burden of foreign debt, the alarming reduction\r\nin capital flows, the trend toward a decline in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, the weak rate of investment, the\r\ncontinued imbalance in the terms of trade — despite the\r\ndevaluation of the CFA Franc in January 1994 —\r\nprotectionism on export markets, continued weak\r\ncommodities prices, and so on.\r\nWe have every right to be pleased that over the last\r\nfive years, the struggle to eradicate poverty has been a\r\nprominent issue in negotiations and the drafting of\r\ndeclarations and programmes of action adopted by\r\nsummits and conferences organized under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAs we approach the end of the International Year for\r\nthe Eradication of Poverty and the beginning next year,\r\n1997, of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty, new national and international efforts must be\r\nmade to mobilize the vast resources needed to eliminate\r\npoverty.\r\nIn addition, as the decisions and recommendations of\r\nthe Second United Nations Conference on Human\r\nSettlements (Habitat II) are implemented, they will be\r\ntangible assets for present and future generations in the\r\nprocess of building a more human and better society\r\nthrough exercise of the right to adequate housing for all.\r\nEnvironmental protection is essential if we are to\r\npromote sustainable development. Faced with the threat\r\nto mankind posed by the rise in sea levels, global\r\nwarming, creeping desertification and the disappearance\r\nof biological diversity, Benin attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to implementation of all the agreements\r\nreached in Rio and, here, renews its commitment to doing\r\nall it can to ensure the success of the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly planned for June 1997 to\r\nstrengthen implementation of the decisions and\r\nrecommendations of the Earth Summit contained in\r\nAgenda 21. In accordance with the commitments made at\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment in June 1992 in Rio, by the end of the year\r\nBenin will have adopted its own national Agenda 21 and,\r\nat the same time, will begin drawing up local\r\nAgendas 21.\r\nIn the context of the effective implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Convention to Control\r\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa, the\r\nGovernment of Benin held a national forum from 20 to\r\n22 August 1996 which was the starting point for the\r\nprocess of drawing up its national programme of action to\r\ncombat desertification through a partnership of\r\nGovernment, local populations, non-governmental\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\norganizations, development associations, the private sector\r\nand development partners.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank the\r\ninterim secretariat of the Convention and, above all, the\r\nGovernment of Germany and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, whose technical and financial\r\nsupport proved decisive in the holding of this successful\r\nforum.\r\nIt is regrettable that five years after it was launched,\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s has not had the expected impact on the\r\ndevelopment of Africa even though the priorities our States\r\nopted for were largely in line with its objectives, including\r\nin the area of democratic and macroeconomic reforms.\r\nThis is why Benin welcomes the launching by the\r\nSecretary-General on 15 March 1996 of the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa, an initiative that\r\ncomplements the New Agenda and provides it with new\r\nimpetus. I should like here to reaffirm Benin’s adherence to\r\nthis Initiative whose objectives fit perfectly with those of\r\nour national development plans. Implementation of the\r\npriority actions of the Initiative require the mobilization of\r\nAfricans themselves, bodies of the United Nations system\r\nand Africa’s development partners to ensure ambitious,\r\nconcerted and coordinated action designed to lead to\r\ntangible results in Africa.\r\nWe applaud the initiatives of the United Nations\r\nsystem which has long been working for the development\r\nof Africa, as well as the actions of all partners for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa, including France and Japan, which\r\nhave made the development and economic recovery of\r\nAfrica a priority.\r\nWe appeal to all Member States diligently to\r\nimplement the results of the mid-term review of United\r\nNations New Agenda in order to accelerate the process of\r\nstrengthening the effective integration of Africa into the\r\ninternational trading system, help Africa diversify its\r\neconomy and encourage direct foreign investment.\r\nAlong the same lines, The Agenda for Development,\r\nwhich Benin actively helped to draft, should be effectively\r\nimplemented to achieve the development objectives of\r\ndeveloping countries, the least-developed countries in\r\nparticular.\r\nMassive and persistent human rights violations are\r\ntoday both source and consequence of ethnic, racial and\r\nreligious tensions which continue to persist in certain\r\nparts of the globe, particularly on our continent, Africa.\r\nThe Government of Benin considers that all States,\r\nwhatever their political system, their economic level and\r\ntheir culture, have a duty to promote, protect and respect\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard,\r\nBenin reaffirms its deep commitment to respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, whose\r\npromotion and protection are a legitimate concern of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nFor our part, we in Benin have continued to strive to\r\nconsolidate our new democratic experience which has\r\nbeen in place since the historic National Conference of\r\nActive Forces of the Nation in February 1990.\r\nI know that all members have been following with\r\ninterest, and are well informed about, the deep-seated\r\nqualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I\r\nwish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank\r\neveryone for the genuine interest with which they have\r\nfollowed our major political event: the recent presidential\r\nelection in March 1996, in which we could see a peaceful\r\nand orderly democratic transfer of power, without\r\nviolence or bloodshed, which was totally in keeping with\r\nthe rule of constitutional law in force since December\r\n1990. The generally correct and normal conduct of the\r\nballot, the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our\r\npolitical classes, the courageous and responsible attitude\r\nof the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken\r\ncontinually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which\r\ndemonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable\r\ncommitment to building a truly democratic society in the\r\nRepublic of Benin.\r\nTo complete its programme of building a State based\r\non the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all\r\ncitizens of Benin would enjoy a certain minimum\r\nstandard of living, the Government of Benin wishes to\r\nbenefit further from the support and assistance of the\r\nentire international community. We are well aware of the\r\nfact that merely going through the motions of an election\r\nis not enough to install and guarantee lasting democracy\r\nin a country.\r\nFor democracy to have real meaning and for a\r\npeople to fully enjoy the freedom and salvation it brings,\r\nit must be expressed both on the national and\r\ninternational levels. This means that democracy must\r\nalso underlie and govern the organization and conduct of\r\ninternational relations. The world, so long divided by\r\nEast-West antagonism and by North-South imbalances,\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\ncan and must conceive and implement new, democratic\r\nrelations among States. Here it is no exaggeration to say\r\nthat the renewal of the United Nations begun thanks to the\r\ncourageous, tenacious and fruitful actions of Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali must be resolutely sustained and developed\r\nto guarantee the conditions necessary for the harmonious\r\npursuit of the process of democratization in international\r\nsociety on the eve of the twenty-first century. The\r\ndelegation of Benin is convinced that our present\r\ndeliberations on all issues of reform of the Organization\r\nwill be guided by our shared determination to take\r\nconcerted, specific and realistic measures which, better than\r\nin the past, respond to the great stakes and challenges\r\nemerging on the horizon of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Czech Republic, His Excellency Mr. Josef Zieleniec.\r\nMr. Zieleniec (Czech Republic): Let me congratulate\r\nAmbassador Razali on his election to the office of President\r\nof the fifty-first session of the General Assembly and wish\r\nhim all the best in that challenging post. I would also like\r\nto thank the outgoing President, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral, for the outstanding manner in which he conducted\r\nthe work of the previous session.\r\nA year ago, many world leaders gathered here to\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nand, in particular, to discuss its future prospects. No one\r\nquestioned its importance as a worldwide forum for dealing\r\nwith important global problems. Based on the principle of\r\nuniversality, it should be open to all those who are willing\r\nand ready to participate in this endeavour.\r\nBut as it enters the second half-century of its\r\nexistence, the United Nations faces increasing, ever more\r\ncomplex and often even conflicting demands. Its response\r\nhas often been to try to do everything, eventually watering\r\ndown its energies and drive, thus contributing to a\r\nperception of declining efficiency. It should in fact focus\r\nonly on what it does best: maintaining international peace\r\nand security, promoting respect for human rights, providing\r\ndevelopment assistance and alleviating human suffering.\r\nWe therefore believe that a critical stage in its reform\r\nshould consist of setting out clear-cut priorities for United\r\nNations action. There are areas where the United Nations\r\nholds a competitive advantage, where it can act more\r\nefficiently than individual States or regional organizations,\r\nand where it has proven its ability to achieve more cost-\r\neffective and rapid results than other entities.\r\nReform is no longer a subject for discussion. Action\r\nis needed. Significant steps in the right direction have, of\r\ncourse, already been taken. We have noted with\r\nsatisfaction the gradual downsizing of the Secretariat in\r\nthe past several years and the adoption of a no-growth\r\nbudget for the current period. Similar efforts by\r\nspecialized agencies have furthermore included moves\r\ntowards their better coordination. We welcome the\r\nestablishment of an Efficiency Board within the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nThough reform is well under way, the current system\r\nis still hindered by overlapping mandates and duplication\r\nin the work of various United Nations bodies and\r\nspecialized agencies. Departments within secretariats\r\nsuffer from insufficient coordination and oversight\r\nmechanisms, unclear priorities and bureaucratic\r\nprocedures. Intense reflection on these matters is taking\r\nplace in various United Nations bodies. The Open-ended\r\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations System has discussed rationalizing the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s methods and organization of its\r\nwork, streamlining its agenda and reshaping its subsidiary\r\nmachinery, as well as reforming the structures and\r\nfunctioning of the Secretariat. We hope that some of these\r\nideas will mature enough to be presented as formal\r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly.\r\nThe financial situation of the United Nations\r\ncontinues to be critical, in spite of a reduction in\r\npeacekeeping activities. In our view, there are two main\r\ncauses of this situation: the present method of assessing\r\ncontributions and arrears.\r\nOn the first point, we believe that a new scale of\r\nassessments should be developed that would equitably\r\nreflect the economic circumstances of individual Member\r\nStates and their capacity to pay, based primarily on gross\r\nnational product (GNP) indicators. On the second point,\r\nit is essential that Member States fulfil their financial\r\nobligations in full, on time and without conditions.\r\nCertain incentives and disincentives should be adopted to\r\nencourage Member States to honour their financial\r\ncommitments. These measures, however, should not be\r\napplied to Members unable to pay for reasons beyond\r\ntheir control.\r\nThe Czech Republic fully associates itself with the\r\nEuropean Union’s package of financial proposals. I recall\r\nalso that our share of peacekeeping operations has not\r\nbeen determined yet. We take this issue very seriously\r\nand have made certain specific proposals to resolve it.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nSecurity Council reform has attracted extremely wide\r\nattention. As I mentioned in 1995, we support an increase\r\nin both permanent and non-permanent seats while insisting\r\non safeguarding rapid and effective Council action. Yet the\r\nmore members it has, the more its effectiveness will be\r\nhindered. In our view, therefore, only a modest expansion\r\nis feasible. We oppose new categories of membership.\r\nThe criteria for new permanent members should\r\ninclude their level of commitment to maintaining peace, to\r\npromoting development and to meeting their financial\r\nobligations to the United Nations. We believe Germany and\r\nJapan are suitable candidates, and support an expanded\r\nrepresentation of Africa, Latin America and Asia.\r\nThe second aspect of Security Council reform relates\r\nto its working methods. Several proposals have been\r\nsubmitted, including the Czech one, on a broader\r\ninterpretation of Article 31 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe proposals submitted include a number of points\r\nacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Member States.\r\nWe regret that the Working Group on the Security Council\r\nhas not yet reached consensus on any of them. We believe\r\nthat issues not requiring amendments to the Charter should\r\nbe resolved separately from those that would. We will\r\npursue our efforts in this respect and strive for some\r\nagreement next year.\r\nHaving been elected to the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and having assumed the post of its Vice-President,\r\nwe have taken on a fair share of responsibility for its work.\r\nWe strongly support reform efforts to restructure the\r\nCouncil and to enhance its efficiency and its coordinating\r\nrole. It should more adequately reflect the new world\r\neconomic and social situation. We believe that the\r\nCouncil’s position within the United Nations system should\r\nbe strengthened and its procedures streamlined. It should\r\nprovide policy guidance for development activities and\r\nbecome the supreme steering and coordinating body for all\r\nUnited Nations-based programmes that fall under its\r\npurview.\r\nRestructuring its functional commissions is a key\r\naspect of its reform. Regional economic commissions\r\nshould play a more visible role. Upgrading development\r\ncooperation with Bretton Woods institutions and the World\r\nTrade Organization is another challenge for the Economic\r\nand Social Council. To reduce duplication with the General\r\nAssembly, the Council should pass on to the Assembly only\r\nthose issues that it does not have the power to decide by\r\nitself. On the other hand, the General Assembly should\r\nstrike from its agenda those items that are fully within the\r\nCouncil’s authority.\r\nAlthough the Czech Republic’s two-year term on the\r\nSecurity Council expired at the end of 1995, we continue\r\nto pay attention to the conflicts and other events that\r\nendanger world peace and security.\r\nThe Dayton peace process gave a chance to the\r\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the other\r\ncountries involved. The September 1996 elections\r\nconstituted a milestone on the road to a lasting peace in\r\nthe Balkans. The Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe performed its election task in an\r\noutstanding manner. We applaud all those who\r\nparticipated in those elections.\r\nOn the other hand, we cannot ignore the fact that the\r\nelection results reconfirmed ethnic divisions in the\r\ncountry. It will not be easy for the parties to overcome\r\nthis problem. The international community should\r\ntherefore remain alert and continue in its peaceful\r\nengagement by committing the necessary troops and by\r\nexerting political pressure on all the parties to keep up the\r\nmomentum of the Dayton peace process. Local elections,\r\nto be held in November, are the next step in this process.\r\nIt is important that all planned political institutions be\r\nformed and start functioning as soon as possible.\r\nAnother area of deep interest to us is the Middle\r\nEast. As a participant in the multilateral talks on peace\r\nand economic cooperation in the Middle East and as one\r\nof the donor States in the area, we have consistently\r\nvoiced our full support for the continuation of the peace\r\nprocess based on a just and comprehensive solution of the\r\nissues. We do so again today with renewed urgency in\r\nview of the recent tragic events in Jerusalem.\r\nSecurity and stability in the Gulf region are\r\nimportant to the Czech Republic. We support all efforts\r\nto solve the tense situation concerning Iraq. Iraq must\r\ncomply unconditionally with all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions in order for sanctions to be lifted and for Iraq\r\nto return to the international community. At the same\r\ntime, the territorial integrity of Iraq must be preserved.\r\nWe look forward to a peaceful resolution of the Iraqi\r\nissue. For humanitarian reasons we hope that Security\r\nCouncil resolution 986 (1995) is implemented as soon as\r\nconditions permit.\r\nDespite geographical distance, we are deeply\r\nconcerned by conflicts in African countries, such as\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nAngola, Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda and Burundi. My\r\ncountry supports United Nations efforts to rid these\r\ncountries of war and suffering, which, besides engendering\r\nviolence, further widen the gap between developed\r\ncountries and these often desperately poor countries.\r\nThe Czech Republic intends to contribute to\r\ninternational stability and economic development.\r\nDomestically, we laid the foundations for this policy by\r\nstrengthening our democratic institutions and by reforming\r\nour economy. Internationally, this effort was endorsed last\r\nDecember when the Czech Republic was admitted to the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD). For my Government, OECD membership amounts\r\nalso to a serious commitment to share the knowledge and\r\nexperience of the Czech people with other countries and to\r\nprovide development assistance.\r\nSolid domestic results are also a precondition for\r\nmembership in the European Union and in the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These regional\r\narrangements are vital for Europe’s security structure.\r\nThrough membership in NATO, the Czech Republic intends\r\nto contribute to Europe’s security and stability. The\r\ndecision on our membership will be made by NATO\r\nmembers and by our country. Russia’s participation in\r\ndiscussions on European security is, of course, critical, and\r\nwe understand the need for a strategic partnership between\r\nNATO and the Russian Federation. These discussions,\r\nhowever, should not precondition the process of NATO\r\nenlargement.\r\nPeacekeeping is an important tool in the hands of the\r\nSecurity Council. However, it has its limits, in so far as\r\nhostilities often occur within States. These limits are\r\ndictated by the principles of impartiality, the non-use of\r\nforce — except in self-defence — and consent of the\r\nparties. Following United Nations experiences in Somalia,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and, most recently, in Liberia,\r\nunwarranted enthusiasm concerning peacekeepers has\r\nevaporated.\r\nThe Czech Republic has been actively participating in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. We support the establishment\r\nof stand-by arrangements and intend to participate in the\r\nsystem aimed at expanding United Nations capacities to\r\ndeploy its forces. My country’s participation in the\r\nImplementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nis our current major effort devoted to peace. The United\r\nNations does not have peace-enforcement instruments of its\r\nown, but regional arrangements are often useful in\r\nenforcing peace. Our IFOR experience only confirms this.\r\nLast year we signed the Convention on the Safety of\r\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel, and we\r\nanticipate its early ratification. We hope that it will enter\r\ninto force soon.\r\nThe fifth Review Conference of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) reconfirmed\r\nthe elimination of nuclear weapons as its ultimate goal.\r\nConcluding the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nrepresents a significant step in this direction, and we\r\nintend to sign the Treaty very shortly. It is disturbing\r\nhowever, that the Conference on Disarmament did not\r\nreach consensus on this question and that the Treaty was\r\nnot adopted unanimously. Every effort should be made to\r\nachieve universality of NPT membership. Perhaps the\r\nmost important task is the implementation of Article VI\r\nof the Treaty. The role of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament in this process is irreplaceable and will take\r\non even more importance, as the Conference is expected\r\nto deal with another growing problem that we want to\r\nhelp resolve — the elimination of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines.\r\nMatters of security have long ceased to be only\r\nmatters of armies and weapons. The devastating social\r\ndamage done by drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking\r\nthreaten the entire international community. Close\r\ninternational cooperation in tackling the drug menace\r\nshould be our response to this dangerous challenge.\r\nInternational terrorism is another source of great\r\nconcern. The international community must stand united\r\nto suppress it. It is the responsibility of each State to fight\r\nterrorism and to strictly apply and abide by all\r\ninternational instruments in this field. We appeal to States\r\nthat have not ratified the appropriate conventions to do so\r\nwithout delay and to implement them.\r\nThe Czech Government attaches great importance to\r\nthe promotion of human rights and in particular to United\r\nNations activities in this field. An environment that\r\nupholds human rights is our best protection as individuals\r\nand as a society. We defend human rights because it is in\r\nour own best interest. This year the Czech Republic has\r\nbeen elected to the United Nations Commission on\r\nHuman Rights. As a member of the Commission, we\r\nintend to contribute actively to its work and to meet the\r\nobjectives of the international community in this field.\r\nPresident Havel is one of the 16 Heads of State or\r\nGovernment who have recently issued a statement on\r\nreviving multilateralism. The statement voices deep\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nconcern over the lack of progress, both in pace and in\r\nscope, of multilateral renewal. Nations must either move\r\nforward to reform and strengthen the United Nations\r\nsystem, or we risk facing a weakened solidarity, more\r\nunilateralism and perhaps conflict and overt disregard of\r\ninternational law and human values. Multilateral diplomacy\r\ngoes well beyond the United Nations itself. Regional\r\ncooperation is crucial to strengthening global cooperation.\r\nWithout a stronger United Nations, however, other forms of\r\ninternational cooperation will lose coherence.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Yemen,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdulkarim Al-Eryany.\r\nMr. Al-Eryany (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt is a pleasure for me to warmly congratulate Mr. Razali\r\non his election to the presidency of the fifty-first session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are sure that his extensive\r\nexperience and political sophistication will make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the success of its work. I should\r\nlike also to express my thanks and appreciation to his\r\npredecessor for his judicious management of the work of\r\nthe General Assembly during its last session.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express once\r\nmore my country’s appreciation of the role played by the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and of his\r\nsincere, invaluable efforts to strengthen the role of the\r\nOrganization in keeping abreast of international events and\r\ndevelopments to the benefit of all humanity and in order to\r\npreserve international peace and security. On behalf of\r\nYemen, I would also like to express my country’s support\r\nfor the re-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a\r\nsecond term as Secretary-General so he can continue the\r\ncomprehensive restructuring of the United Nations, which\r\nwill enable it to play a significant and fundamental role\r\nresponsive to the demands of the twenty-first century.\r\nAs this session is being held, new and dangerous\r\ndevelopments are taking place, threatening peace and\r\nsecurity in the Middle East. The situation in Jerusalem and\r\nother parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has\r\nexploded as a result of the aggressive unjustified actions\r\nand harsh practices undertaken by the Israeli authorities\r\nagainst the Palestinian people, and their continued attempts\r\nto change the character of Holy Al-Quds Al-Sharif. The\r\nmost recent of these attempts was Israel’s opening of a\r\ntunnel linking Al-Borac Square and Al-Mujahidin Street\r\nnear Bab Al-Asbat, threatening the integrity of Al-Haram\r\nAl-Sharif and other Islamic monuments. During the last few\r\ndays, the Israeli army and police force have used various\r\nkinds of weapons and live ammunition against unarmed\r\nPalestinian protesters. These clashes have caused the\r\ndeath or injury of hundreds of innocent Palestinians.\r\nWe strongly condemn and denounce the actions and\r\npractices of the Israeli military forces and their repeated\r\nacts of aggression against Palestinian officials and citizens\r\nin Arab Al-Quds and other Palestinian towns, which have\r\nled to the death and injury of hundreds of people. The\r\nterrorism and oppression carried out by the Israeli\r\noccupying authority constitute a gross violation of human\r\nrights, legitimate international resolutions and the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention, which applies to occupied territories.\r\nThis critical development can only exacerbate the\r\nsituation and return the region to a cycle of tension and\r\nviolence. It threatens peace and security not only in the\r\nMiddle East region but in the whole world.\r\nThis year, the Republic of Yemen celebrated the\r\nsixth anniversary of its unification, achieved after\r\nsuccessfully overcoming all the difficulties and challenges\r\nin the way of unity and development. These celebrations\r\ncoincided with preparations for voter registration for the\r\nsecond parliamentary elections since the reunification of\r\nour country, which are to be held in April 1997\r\nreinforcing democracy in our country. Our democratic\r\napproach is demonstrated by our political pluralism, and\r\nour respect for human rights and freedom of the press,\r\nand will enable us to achieve qualitative changes in the\r\neconomic, social and political life of Yemeni citizens.\r\nToday the Republic of Yemen is enjoying stability,\r\na democratic process and economic reforms, which must\r\nenjoy the encouragement and support of the international\r\ncommunity since this democratic process will contribute\r\nto the strengthening of security and stability at the local\r\nand regional levels.\r\nAt the same time, our people are in the midst of a\r\ndifficult and important battle for social and economic\r\ndevelopment and modernization and for the elimination of\r\nbackwardness. Some of the most serious problems we\r\nface as a developing country are inflation, the increase in\r\nthe rates of population growth and their effects on the\r\ngrowth rate of the national economy. In order to deal with\r\nthat, the Government has adopted a programme of\r\neconomic, financial and administrative reforms in\r\ncooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development\r\nwith the aim of correcting economic, financial and\r\nstructural imbalances. This has been done to achieve\r\nbalance and stability in the economy as a whole and to\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nactivate the role of the private sector on the basis of a\r\nmarket economy and free competition, while taking into\r\naccount the importance of improving basic essential social\r\nservices, building a modern State and improving the\r\nstandard of living of citizens.\r\nEfforts by the Yemeni Government to implement this\r\nprogramme have yielded improvements and have had\r\nnotable success, especially in preventing the collapse of the\r\nlocal currency, reducing the rate of inflation and achieving\r\na positive growth rate. However, it has proved difficult to\r\nalleviate suffering in the social sphere. These difficulties\r\nhave been compounded by the disastrous floods which\r\nplagued Yemen last June, causing extensive, grave losses of\r\nlife and property. These affected some parts of the\r\ninfrastructure and harmed many people. Agricultural land\r\nwas eroded and livestock was destroyed. Houses, roads,\r\nbridges, health centres, sources of drinking water and\r\nschools in many areas of the Republic of Yemen were all\r\ndestroyed. These losses and damages were a major disaster\r\nand economic setback for Yemen.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to renew my call\r\nfor international and humanitarian organizations and\r\nfraternal and friendly Governments to provide help and\r\nsupport to overcome the disastrous effects of the floods. I\r\nwould also like to thank all those organizations and\r\nGovernments that have responded and offered support for\r\nand solidarity with the people of Yemen in their ordeal.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, in the framework of its\r\npolitical orientation, is pursuing a foreign policy based on\r\nmutual respect and the common interests of States. It\r\ntherefore stresses the importance of maintaining security,\r\nstability and cooperation among all States in the region. In\r\nthis regard, demarcation of the border between our country\r\nand the fraternal Sultanate of Oman has been definitively\r\nconcluded through a dialogue based upon mutual interests,\r\nequitable treatment and respect for the rights of both\r\ncountries. This achievement represents a significant positive\r\nstep that will serve security and stability in the region and\r\ndeepen trust between the two countries. Similarly, our\r\ncountry is working with the same sincerity and credibility\r\nto settle the issue of the border with the fraternal Kingdom\r\nof Saudi Arabia on the basis of mutual interests and in the\r\nlight of the Taif Agreement and the contents of the\r\nmemorandum of understanding signed by the two countries\r\non 26 February 1995 in the Holy City of Mecca.\r\nPursuant to this, joint committees have been formed to\r\ndiscuss the border issue, its demarcation, the development\r\nof all aspects of cultural, trade and economic relations and\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the two fraternal\r\ncountries.\r\nMoreover, a security agreement was signed on 27\r\nJuly 1996 that emphasized the concerns of both countries\r\nfor their joint security and to combat terrorism, exchange\r\nsecurity information and strengthen cooperation between\r\ntheir institutions, thus giving concrete form to the spirit of\r\nthe 1934 Taif Treaty and the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding signed on 26 February 1995. An agreement\r\non technical, investment, trade and economic cooperation\r\nwas also signed.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has shown a sincere desire\r\nand strong political will and has made continuous efforts\r\nto address the matter of the Eritrean occupation in\r\nmid-December 1995 of the Yemeni island of Hanish\r\nal-Kabir in the Red Sea. While negotiations were taking\r\nplace between the two countries aimed at reaching a\r\npeaceful settlement that would respect legal, historical and\r\ngeographical rights, our country did not opt for the use of\r\nforce. From the very first day, we stressed the necessity\r\nof using peaceful means, dialogue through mediators and\r\ninternational arbitration in order to spare the two\r\nneighbouring peoples the scourges of war and conflict, in\r\nkeeping with its belief in the principles and purposes of\r\nthe United Nations and its commitment to the provisions\r\nof the Charter. Accordingly, an agreement of principles\r\nbetween Yemen and Eritrea was officially signed in Paris\r\non 21 May 1996. This was the fruit of French, Egyptian\r\nand Ethiopian mediation efforts and of the support of our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. This\r\nagreement was a sound basis on which to settle peacefully\r\nthe dispute between the two countries regarding issues of\r\nterritorial sovereignty and maritime borders. On this basis,\r\ndiscussions have begun on special arbitration measures\r\nand the mechanism to be used with a view to starting the\r\nprocess as soon as possible. It is unfortunate that, despite\r\nall these procedures, Eritrea took new action on the island\r\nof Hanish af-Saghir on 10 August 1996. This act violated\r\nthe agreement of principles and created an atmosphere of\r\ntension and conflict in the region, threatening stability,\r\nsecurity and the safety of international shipping in the\r\nregion.\r\nNow that Eritrea has withdrawn its forces from the\r\nisland of Hanish af-Saghir and the crisis has passed, we\r\nwould like to express our thanks and appreciation for the\r\nrole played and efforts made by France and its special\r\nenvoy, and the positions of the Secretary-General and the\r\nPresident and members of the Security Council, and to all\r\nthose fraternal and friendly States that declared their\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nsupport for the principles agreed upon for resolving the\r\nconflict peacefully through arbitration. Finally, my country\r\nwould like to stress that a peaceful settlement is the proper\r\nway to improve relations between Yemen and Eritrea and\r\nto promote the trust necessary to creating an atmosphere\r\nconducive to the development of relations between the two\r\ncountries and the peoples of Yemen and Eritrea.\r\nThe civil war in Somalia has gone beyond the bounds\r\nof reason and, as our country is a neighbour of fraternal\r\nSomalia, we have found ourselves shouldering the burden\r\nof receiving and housing tens of thousands of refugees. We\r\nhave also cooperated with the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and non-governmental\r\norganizations in sheltering and feeding the Somali refugees,\r\nalthough this is a heavy burden on our country and\r\ncompounds its existing economic and social ills.\r\nWe are deeply disturbed by the continuing\r\nfragmentation, fighting and uncertainty in Somalia. The\r\nRepublic of Yemen considers that the responsibility for\r\nsolving the refugee problem, which is a social and\r\neconomic burden of significant proportions, and the solution\r\nof the Somali problem lie with the Somalis themselves. On\r\nthat basis, we urge the Somali leadership once again to\r\ndemonstrate greater political will and a genuine desire to\r\nreach a final settlement for peace and stability in their\r\ncountry and to engage in dialogue in order to save their\r\npeople, rebuild their country and give the refugees the\r\nopportunity to return to their homes and resettle. In order\r\nto facilitate this, Yemen has received a number of Somali\r\nleaders and made every effort to assist the Somalis\r\nthemselves to reach a national accord acceptable to all. We\r\nhope these efforts will be successful. The achievement of\r\nnational reconciliation in Somalia and the improvement of\r\nsecurity and stability in that country and the entire Horn of\r\nAfrica are at the forefront of our concerns, embodying our\r\nhistorical and strategic relationships, which are inextricably\r\nintertwined with all the States of the region.\r\nIn view of the Republic of Yemen’s positive support\r\nfor the peace process in the Middle East, which began with\r\nthe Madrid Conference in October 1991, guaranteeing a just\r\nand comprehensive peace on the basis of legitimate\r\ninternational resolutions, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and\r\nsubsequent agreements and protocols in this regard, and on\r\nthe basis of the principle of land for peace and guarantees\r\nof complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab\r\nterritories, we once again emphasize the necessity for a\r\nlasting, just and comprehensive peace as the basis for\r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity in the region. Only this can\r\nensure that the root causes of violence and extremism will\r\nbe destroyed and that the values of tolerance, peaceful\r\ncoexistence and civilized cooperation among peoples will\r\nbe promoted.\r\nAccordingly, we would like to express our concern\r\nabout the resumption of the Israeli policy of settlement on\r\nPalestinian land, especially around the city of Al-Quds\r\nAl-Sharif. The Israelis are establishing settlements,\r\ndestroying Palestinian houses, building bypass roads for\r\nIsraeli settlers, continuing the blockade of Palestinian\r\nlands and refusing to redeploy Israeli forces out of\r\nHebron. These Israeli practices constitute blatant\r\nviolations of agreements and pledges made between Israel\r\nand the Palestinian Authority and can only exacerbate\r\ntensions and return the peace process to its starting point,\r\npossibly even derailing the entire process.\r\nWe therefore stress the importance of making rapid\r\nprogress towards a final settlement leading to restoration\r\nof the Palestinians’ legitimate rights, particularly the\r\nrights to self-determination and to establish an\r\nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital, in\r\naccordance with relevant international resolutions and the\r\nbasic principles underlying the Madrid Conference.\r\nNegotiations on the basis of those principles and with all\r\nparties respecting their commitments should be conducted\r\non all tracks.\r\nThe peace process is currently facing risks and\r\nchallenges that are preventing it from achieving its aims.\r\nIsrael is deliberately dragging its feet and is persistent in\r\nits procrastination over negotiations with the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic on the basis of the agreements reached by both\r\nparties under the previous Israeli Government. Among the\r\nmost important of these was the obligation to withdraw\r\nfully from the occupied Syrian Golan and southern\r\nLebanon in accordance with relevant international\r\nresolutions and the principle of “land for peace”. We\r\nstress the need for Israel to respect the sovereignty and\r\nindependence of fraternal Lebanon, release Lebanese\r\nprisoners and detainees from Israeli concentration camps\r\nand acknowledge its responsibility to compensate\r\nLebanon for the losses it has sustained as a result of the\r\ncontinuing Israeli acts of aggression against its land and\r\npeople.\r\nA just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East, together with security and stability in the\r\nregion, can be achieved only if every State of the region\r\nfulfils its obligations equally and through the\r\nestablishment of a nuclear-, biological- and chemical-\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nweapon-free zone in the region. Israel must ratify the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\r\nsubmit its nuclear installations to the international\r\ninspection regime as a step towards establishing a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East and freeing the area\r\nfrom the threat of all weapons of mass destruction. In this\r\ncontext, we would like to express our satisfaction at the\r\nsigning of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at\r\nthe beginning of this session. Yemen will sign the Treaty\r\ntoday.\r\nWhile Yemen stresses the importance of Iraq’s total\r\ncompliance with resolutions of the international community\r\nand its continuing cooperation with the United Nations, we\r\nwould also stress the need to preserve the unity, territorial\r\nsovereignty and integrity of Iraq. We also express our great\r\nconcern about and condemnation of any action in this\r\nregard affecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nIraq and appeal for the alleviation of the suffering of the\r\nIraqi people. We therefore welcome the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding signed in May 1996 between Iraq and the\r\nUnited Nations on the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 986 (1995), providing for the sale of petroleum\r\nfor the purchase of food as a first step towards alleviating\r\nthe terrible suffering of the fraternal Iraqi people.\r\nWe call upon the international community and the\r\nSecurity Council to pursue the lifting of the air blockade\r\nand other measures imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\npursuant to Security Council resolutions and to respond to\r\nthe resolutions and proposals of regional organizations. The\r\nmost recent of these was the initiative put forward at the\r\nemergency Arab summit held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June\r\n1996 in order to resolve the conflict between the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya and the three countries concerned.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen renews its call to the fraternal\r\ncountries of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United\r\nArab Emirates to continue a direct dialogue aimed at\r\nreaching a peaceful settlement of the issue of the three\r\nislands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of good neighbourliness and respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States in the region,\r\nand to resort to international arbitration in a manner that\r\nwill satisfy both parties.\r\nOur country also emphasizes its solidarity with\r\nfraternal Bahrain and expresses its complete support for the\r\nmeasures it has taken to ensure its security and stability.\r\nThe tragic situation of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina has preoccupied the Yemeni people. The\r\nRepublic of Yemen therefore welcomes the Agreements\r\nthat the parties involved in the conflict reached last\r\nNovember in Dayton and Paris in order to bring peace to\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and to express its satisfaction\r\nwith the contents of the Agreements, which stressed the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. On this occasion, we wish to\r\nregister our appreciation of the efforts made by the United\r\nStates of America and the States of the European Union\r\nto bring about these Agreements. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to provide every possible support\r\nto the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their plans\r\nfor the development and reconstruction of their country.\r\nWe would also stress the need for every party to\r\nsurrender all war criminals to the International Tribunal\r\nin The Hague so that they may be brought to account for\r\ntheir heinous crimes against humanity in violation of\r\ninternational law, human rights and international\r\nagreements.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, in view of its geographical\r\nposition on the Indian Ocean, places particular importance\r\non any effort made to strengthen cooperation between the\r\nOcean’s littoral States. Accordingly, our country took part\r\nin the most recent meeting, held in Mauritius, to complete\r\nthe drafting of the constitution and platform of action for\r\nthe planned Indian Ocean rim initiative.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our satisfaction\r\nwith the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian\r\nOcean to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean\r\nas a Zone of Peace, free of nuclear weapons. We call\r\nupon the permanent members of the Security Council and\r\nmaritime users of the Indian Ocean to participate in the\r\nwork of the Committee in order to strengthen security,\r\npeace, stability and cooperation in the region in\r\naccordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our hope that\r\nthe work of this session will enjoy every success,\r\nstrengthening the United Nations and its bodies and\r\nenabling them to achieve their goals and the ideals\r\nembodied in the Charter in a manner appropriate to the\r\nspirit of the age and international changes.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, His Excellency\r\nMr. Roberto Robaina González.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nMr. Robaina González (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): A year ago, from this same rostrum, I began my\r\nstatement by reading some 10 hair-raising news items of\r\nthe moment from the international press, on bellicose\r\nconflicts, violence and death in the cities and deadly\r\nepidemics claiming new victims. Intending to do this again\r\ntoday, I found that the situation remains the same, or is\r\nperhaps even worse. Unfortunately, the world wasted\r\nanother 12 months without doing anything to stop such\r\ncatastrophic events.\r\nAs if it were necessary to illustrate this with specific\r\nfacts, even as we gathered here we once again witnessed\r\nthe bloodshed of the heroic Palestinian people. First and\r\nforemost, I denounce the new Israeli aggression and the\r\npolicy of hegemony that defends these acts, and I express\r\nsupport for our Palestinian brothers in their struggle for\r\ntheir legitimate right to finally have an independent state,\r\nwith Jerusalem its capital.\r\nAlso about a year ago, the Prime Minister of\r\nMalaysia, the country of the President of the General\r\nAssembly, very rightly stated that the United Nations\r\nshould support the collective needs of peoples and nations\r\nin order to serve humanity as a whole, and that it was\r\ntherefore necessary to correct the trend of making them an\r\ninstrument of the wealthy and the powerful. Today it must\r\nbe recognized that we are meeting again without having\r\nremoved that danger.\r\nHence, in expressing my Government’s satisfaction at\r\nhaving President Razali lead us in our work, I cannot but\r\nexpress confidence that his diplomatic professionalism, his\r\npersonal achievements and his long and proven experience\r\nin the work of this Organization will give him strength in\r\nleading us in a remarkably difficult and complex session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nFar from being more democratic and universal, the\r\nOrganization in which we come together today is tending\r\nto tighten more and more the exclusive circle of those who\r\ngovern it. The just demands heard from this rostrum are\r\nnow sounding the alarm at the march of ideas being\r\npromoted mainly in our host country.\r\nJust a few weeks ago, the Chairman of the United\r\nStates Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued an\r\nultimatum for the United Nations to carry out reforms in\r\naccordance with the prescriptions of that country or else\r\nface the consequences. His articles in renowned\r\npublications question precisely the principles on which this\r\ninstitution is founded, particularly the principle of\r\nsovereign equality of States.\r\nFor this influential United States politician and those\r\nwho identify themselves with his primitive views, there is\r\nonly one argument: some States deserve more privileges\r\nthan others. In this way they try to make a dead letter of\r\nthe principle of sovereign equality of States, the\r\ncornerstone of the Charter adopted over 50 years ago in\r\nSan Francisco.\r\nBut there is more: the Government of the United\r\nStates of America, which owes the United Nations the\r\nshameful amount of over $1.5 billion, assumes, with no\r\nembarrassment whatsoever, the right to determine\r\nunilaterally who can or cannot be the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations and to declare how an Organization\r\ndeliberately deprived of the resources required for the\r\nfulfilment of its functions should or should not be\r\nmanaged.\r\nEighty per cent of the work of the United Nations\r\nsystem is devoted to assisting the developing countries\r\nand to strengthening their ability to help themselves. This\r\nendeavour includes the aspiration to receive fair treatment\r\nin international economic relations; to try to save children\r\nfrom starvation and disease; to promote emergency\r\nassistance to refugees and disaster victims; to attempt to\r\ncombat crime, drug addiction and disease; to promote\r\neducation and the development of human resources; and\r\nto tackle the enormous task of halting or slowing the\r\nprogressive ecological deterioration of our planet.\r\nThese are precisely the functions that the notorious\r\nUnited States Senator is trying to abolish, and it is\r\nbecause of the existence of those programmes that the\r\nmanagerial approach of the Secretary-General is so\r\nfiercely attacked.\r\nThat position of the planet’s most powerful country\r\nis not aimed against one person; rather, using the question\r\nof the Organization’s efficiency as a pretext, it stands\r\nagainst the United Nations mandate to attend to the needs\r\nof the great majority of mankind. It is a new and gross\r\nattempt to impose on the community of nations the will\r\nof a single State in the management of the multilateral\r\nforum of cooperation that should be the most\r\nrepresentative and democratic one in the world.\r\nWe should ask ourselves if we, the members of this\r\nAssembly, can passively accept the threat posed by this\r\nunilateral imposition. It is fitting to recall what Harry\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nTruman said of the Charter of the United Nations at the\r\nSan Francisco Conference in 1945:\r\n“If we fail to use it, we shall betray all those\r\nwho have died in order that we might meet here in\r\nfreedom and safety to create it.\r\n“If we seek to use it selfishly — for the\r\nadvantage of any one nation or any small group of\r\nnations — we shall be equally guilty of that betrayal.”\r\n(Documents of the United Nations Conference on\r\nInternational Organization, San Francisco, 1945,\r\nvol. 1, p. 687)\r\nFurther comment is unnecessary; subsequent history\r\nhas been quite eloquent enough. But the most dangerous\r\nthing, as has often been said, is that the United Nations is\r\nmerely the reflection of the world in which we live. This\r\ndomineering unilateralism shows up even more crudely in\r\nthe daily conduct of international relations. In a world in\r\nwhich relations of respect, good-neighbourliness and\r\ncooperation among the peoples and Governments should be\r\nfostered every day, the fact is that one Power, resting on its\r\nunquestionable economic, military and technological might,\r\nseeks to impose rules and norms of conduct on the rest of\r\nthe world, thus undermining the sovereign rights of each\r\nand every one of our nations.\r\nWhat political, legal or moral reason underlies and\r\nlegitimizes the missile attack against the Republic of Iraq\r\nby the United States Armed Forces just a few days ago?\r\nWhat principles or claims can be used to cover up the\r\nunilateral and unjustified use of force? The Security\r\nCouncil did not yield to that unilateral aggression, but it has\r\nnot been able to formulate a clear position on the matter\r\nbecause of its well-known structural and procedural\r\ndeficiencies and also because of the tolerance and impunity\r\nwith which the international community has recently\r\naccepted the haughty arrogance of a Government that\r\nassumes the right to punish sovereign nations at its whim\r\nunder spurious pretexts.\r\nThere is no justification for trampling the territorial\r\nintegrity of a full-fledged Member of this Organization, and\r\neven less for that action to be taken by a single\r\nGovernment, nor for threatening the peace and security of\r\na region inhabited by tens of millions of persons. And all\r\nthis has taken place while the political experts of the\r\naggressor country could not agree on which was its\r\nstrongest motivation: the wretched oil interests or the frenzy\r\nof the ongoing carnival-like electoral campaign in the\r\nUnited States.\r\nIt is incredible that world politics can be paralysed,\r\nthat foreign ministries postpone decisions and that\r\nGovernments advance or delay responses to national or\r\ninternational dilemmas, thinking only of their\r\nrepercussions in that North American simulacrum of\r\ndemocracy. Anything can happen, and no country, legal\r\nprecept or moral principle seems to be safe. Fortunately,\r\nthe super-elections are held only every four years,\r\nbecause if they took place annually, like the sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly, living on this planet would be true\r\nmadness.\r\nThe Helms-Burton Act, aimed against everyone’s\r\nsovereignty and against Cuba, a sovereign State, was\r\nconceived as an additional effort to subdue our people\r\nthrough hunger and poverty. It is an eloquent example of\r\nthe absurd will to impose imperial designs on sovereign\r\nand independent countries in the conduct of their own\r\ninternational and trade relations. For that reason, it has\r\nbeen unanimously rejected by the international\r\ncommunity. That law, ignoring the General Assembly\r\nresolutions on the issue, is intended to strengthen further\r\nthe blockade against our country.\r\nFor a century — and especially during the last 37\r\nyears — the Cuban people have had to face the\r\nhegemonic vocation of successive United States\r\nGovernments. The extraterritorial ambitions of our\r\nneighbour, its attempts to question the sovereign decisions\r\nof another State and its violation of the universally\r\nrecognized principles of international trade are realities\r\nwith which Cuba has been familiar for a long time.\r\nWhen we denounced the crime that was about to\r\ntake place, it was neither to frighten nor to play with\r\nanyone. The Helms-Burton Act, the most sophisticated\r\nbungle of the economic war against Cuba, attacks many\r\ncountries and compels them to experience in their own\r\nsovereignty what we Cubans have been facing for a long\r\ntime. The world can now better understand what so many\r\nyears of continuous offences and extraterritorial acts have\r\nmeant for my homeland.\r\nAnother instance of unipolarity and of the attempt to\r\ndictate the conduct of sovereign States is the law known\r\nas D’Amato-Kennedy, which has also received universal\r\nrepudiation. It repeats the philosophy of imposition and\r\nratifies the tendency to apply United States law beyond its\r\nborders. The argument for this is the alleged war against\r\nterrorism, when, in fact, the United States was the main\r\npromoter of terrorism in its dirty wars in Nicaragua, El\r\nSalvador, Angola and South Africa, against the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nPalestinian patriots and in many other countries — the\r\nUnited States has always supported the bloodiest regimes\r\nthat have ever existed in this world.\r\nThere are just causes and unjust causes. No one will\r\never have the right to kill innocent people, regardless of the\r\nobjectives being pursued. This does not negate any people’s\r\nright to use weapons against its oppressors: to fight cleanly,\r\nyes; to kill innocents, never. A State cannot be allowed to\r\narrogate to itself the right to accuse, condemn and sanction\r\nother nations and to impose by force an illegitimate crusade\r\nthat often serves to disguise the real terrorists.\r\nCuba — which has been the victim of many terrorist\r\nactions and has for many years faced repeated attempts on\r\nthe lives of its political leaders, as well as sabotage,\r\nbiological warfare, the destruction of a passenger plane in\r\nflight and the hijacking of aircraft, and which suffers even\r\ntoday from armed infiltrations and which has been, above\r\nall, the victim of brutal economic terrorism — expects a\r\njoint and conscious effort from the international community\r\nto address the terrorism that has its origins in Langley,\r\nVirginia — that is to say, at the Central Intelligence\r\nAgency — and later spreads to many countries of the\r\nworld.\r\nDrug trafficking, in our opinion, should be dealt with\r\nin the same manner. The drug issue should not be\r\ntransformed into an instrument of pressure against\r\nunderdeveloped countries, many of which do not have\r\nsufficient resources to tackle this scourge. This problem has\r\ntaken on global dimensions and can be confronted only by\r\nsharing responsibilities and using the mechanisms offered\r\nby the United Nations.\r\nThe policy of conferring arbitrary certifications is\r\nunacceptable, and even more so is its use as a pretext to\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of sovereign nations. The\r\ncountry whose enormous rates of consumption have become\r\nthe main market for and driving force behind this criminal\r\nindustry, the country in whose territory the greatest profits\r\nof this business are generated, does not have the moral\r\nauthority to assign responsibility to or demand it from\r\nothers. What would happen if the world, truly concerned by\r\nthe scourge of drugs, were to decertify unanimously the\r\ngreatest drug consumer? To put it another way, people who\r\nlive in glass houses should not throw stones, and he who\r\nhas a beam in his eye should not be so concerned about the\r\nmote in another’s.\r\nNo one can disregard the immense influence of the\r\nUnited States in the so-called post-cold-war period, but\r\nmankind would be making a mistake if it were to look\r\nwith indifference upon the currents of thought within that\r\ncountry that entertain the possibility of governing the rest\r\nof the world or of acting with utter disregard for the\r\nrights and interests of other peoples. We are facing a\r\nKing Kong escaped from his cage, destroying and\r\ncrushing everything around him, aimlessly and out of\r\ncontrol.\r\nWe are not trying to convince this forum that the\r\nUnited States is the source of all the evils of the planet,\r\nbut it would be a mistake to ignore reality and not to take\r\ntimely preventive actions — preferably collective ones —\r\nto admonish to sanity the persons charged with guiding\r\nthat country politically, to do so with a minimum of\r\nresponsibility and to understand that the power of any\r\nnation, important as it might be, has its limits.\r\nThe world is more plagued by uncertainty today than\r\nwhen the new world order was demagogically proclaimed.\r\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, the numbers of\r\narmed conflicts between States, ethnic groups and\r\nreligions have increased. What we see everywhere is not\r\na new order but, rather, a disquieting world in perfect\r\ndisorder. The social and economic consequences of these\r\nconflicts have no parallel in contemporary history, but we\r\ncannot simply pretend that military imposition, coercion\r\nand sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the\r\nnumerous humanitarian problems of the world.\r\nInequalities, rampant underdevelopment,\r\nglobalization and the interdependence that is increasingly\r\nturning into the worst form of dependency should\r\ndisappear so that these new conflicts may, in turn, be\r\neradicated for ever from this world, which, based on\r\ninjustice, is becoming increasingly ungovernable.\r\nEconomic models based on neoliberal philosophy\r\nhave spread throughout much of the third world with the\r\nsupport of the international financial institutions. Although\r\nthese models have generated deceptive, apparently\r\nattractive macroeconomic indicators, in practice they go\r\nhand in hand with an increase in poverty, marginalization,\r\nenvironmental degradation, disease, ignorance, social\r\nconflict, a loss of national resources and sovereignty —\r\nin short, with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nThis neoliberal school of thought is based on\r\nartificial paradigms that should be unmasked. It is false\r\nthat the market, with its magical invisible hand, is the\r\ndefinitive solution for the immense disruptions affecting\r\nthe international economy and that it is the miraculous\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nremedy that would liberate many countries, home to the\r\nvast majority of the earth’s population, from\r\nunderdevelopment and poverty.\r\nIt is false that absolute privatization, which can benefit\r\nonly the few, brings well-being to the legions of the poor\r\nand the wretched living in the third world.\r\nIt is false that geography determines the economic\r\npower of peoples.\r\nIt is false that genetics determines which human\r\nbeings are born to be poor and wretched and which are\r\nborn under the shining star of wealth and extravagance.\r\nIt is false that the State or Government is the main\r\nsource of corruption and inefficiency and should renounce\r\nresponsibility for welfare, health and education, leaving\r\nthese obligations mainly in private hands whose motivations\r\nwill always be limited and discriminatory and are frequently\r\nbased on greed.\r\nIt is false that the poor, the oppressed and the\r\nexploited should have a lesser role in ultra-modern\r\nsocieties.\r\nIt is false that social justice and equity always have to\r\nbe sacrificed for the sake of commercial efficiency.\r\nIt is false that the total removal of protection for\r\nnational industries in the developing countries will yield\r\nhigher productivity, wealth, employment and well-being for\r\ntheir peoples.\r\nIt is false that the sovereignty of nations is an\r\noutmoded principle of international coexistence and that\r\nGovernments and countries are ready to abandon it because\r\nof the strength of transnational capital and the social-\r\npolitical models exported by the North.\r\nFinally, it is false that the neoliberal models that have\r\nbeen sold to us will raise the indicators or levels of human\r\ndevelopment set as objectives by the United Nations.\r\nOne should check the statistics and compare annual\r\nreports, not just between one country and another, but also\r\nbetween indicators for the third world from one year to the\r\nnext in areas such as infant mortality, poverty, education,\r\nlife expectancy, access to drinking water, human\r\nsettlements, schooling for children, and doctors per number\r\nof inhabitants.\r\nAll these falsities, many of them recorded in United\r\nNations documents, hide the bankruptcy of development\r\nprospects for most of the poor countries, which is already\r\nthreatening world stability and aggravating the ecological\r\ndeterioration we all recognized several years ago at the\r\nhistoric Rio Conference. The poor are already falling into\r\nthe immense and ever wider chasm separating them from\r\nthe rich, who continue to grow disproportionately and\r\nirresponsibly without realizing that sooner or later their\r\nown weight will also drag them down into the same pit.\r\nAnd, in this aberrant context, what are we to say\r\nabout the arms race? The rivalry between the big Powers\r\nand the arms race have supposedly disappeared. Why,\r\nthen, in spite of the adoption of international instruments\r\nsupposedly to that end, is there such resistance to real\r\nnuclear disarmament that will free humanity for ever from\r\nthat scourge? Who is responsible for the fact that the\r\nrecently adopted Treaty to ban all nuclear tests does not\r\ncover simulated laboratory tests in which new lethal\r\nweapons will be perfected by those who monopolize\r\nthem, or any commitment to the destruction of arsenals?\r\nUnless we discover life in other galaxies, where will the\r\nenemies endangering the big Powers come from?\r\nFifty-one years after the creation of the United\r\nNations, instead of seeing wealth and development extend\r\nfrom the North to the South, we see the growing threat of\r\nunderdevelopment moving inexorably from the South to\r\nthe North.\r\nIt is said that hunger and poverty are on the rise. In\r\nfact, what has also happened is that wealth is more and\r\nmore concentrated, increasingly exclusive and limited,\r\nwhile walls higher than the one that fell in Berlin are\r\nbeing built.\r\nLet us be frank: the North is not as rich as it seems,\r\nnor is the South as poor as they want to make it. Almost\r\nall the wealth of the North comes from the wealth and\r\nresources of the South. And all the hunger and poverty of\r\nthe South is nothing other than the legacy of over 500\r\nyears of exploitation and disregard for our human rights.\r\nIf we cannot reverse this situation collectively, by\r\nsharing the burden and improving living conditions in the\r\ndeveloping countries, no one will be able to stop the\r\nwaves of migrants attracted by the siren’s song of wealthy\r\nand opulent societies.\r\nThe United Nations has a vast arsenal of documents,\r\nresolutions and initiatives conceived for those purposes\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nbut never implemented. Soon it will be too late. Today we\r\ncan still act.\r\nWhile all this is happening, the blockade of Cuba\r\ncontinues. With the Helms-Burton Act, it has become even\r\nclearer that it is not just an embargo, because in the last\r\nfew months, the United States, through its words and deeds,\r\nhas sent the world sure signals that what is really being\r\nwaged against my country is a long and dirty economic war\r\nfor total control over our sovereignty and our markets.\r\nThe criminal blockade, as part of its frightening\r\nnetwork of measures created over 35 years, has now a\r\nDraconian law that publicly calls for a world crusade to\r\nchange forcibly the Cuban constitutional order and undo a\r\nrevolution defended by our people at the cost of their lives.\r\nWhat have we come to when United States diplomats,\r\non the ugliest mission since the Viet Nam war, tell the\r\nworld that they are granting it a few months’ sovereignty\r\nbefore trampling upon it if the world does not join their\r\nwar on Cuba?\r\nI am fulfilling the mandate bestowed on me by the\r\nfree people of Cuba to proclaim in front of the\r\ninternational community of nations that we will persevere\r\nin our efforts to defend our social, political and economic\r\nactions aimed at ensuring equality, justice and well-being\r\nfor all Cubans.\r\nOur own experience is the best contribution we can\r\nmake as a nation towards meeting the enormous\r\nchallenges facing humanity, as has been shown by Cuba’s\r\neconomic, political and social achievements in the last\r\nyear. A country that has overcome a serious economic\r\ncrisis, that maintains its governability, that grows and\r\ndevelops with the solidarity of many, that expands its\r\nrelations throughout the world and that grows stronger —\r\nthis is a country with a future.\r\nThe socialism we have chosen for our homeland is\r\nour only emancipatory, moral and ethical alternative, with\r\nroots firmly planted in the history of our nation. It is a\r\npath that we chose in freedom and sovereignty, a path\r\nthat we shall not renounce and that no one imposed on us.\r\nWe wish to live in harmony with all the countries of\r\nthe world, including the United States. Cuba wants and\r\nneeds peace. But let us be clear: Cuba is not and never\r\nwill be willing to sacrifice, under pressure from anyone\r\nor in exchange for anything, the independence,\r\nsovereignty and self-determination that it has achieved\r\nand defended at such a high price.\r\nToday, in that blue Caribbean that shelters us, we\r\nCubans will continue with our heads held high, with our\r\nfeet on the ground and with our eyes on the future. Thus\r\ndo we defend our choice: to live in the free and sovereign\r\nhomeland dreamed of by our founding fathers and\r\nachieved by our fathers and grandfathers.\r\nLet there be no doubt. We shall overcome.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
