(Malaysia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Nsanze (Burundi),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: The first speaker is the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Albania,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tritan Shehu, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Shehu (Albania) (interpretation from French):\r\nLet me begin by expressing my warmest congratulations to\r\nMr. Razali Ismail on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as well as my best wishes for his\r\nsuccess. I am pleased also to take this occasion to convey\r\nmy sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral for the excellent manner in which he\r\nguided the proceedings of the Assembly during the previous\r\nsession. We wish also to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ninvaluable contribution and his tireless efforts in effectively\r\nsteering the Organization.\r\nDespite many difficulties and financial problems, the\r\nUnited Nations is striving to play its irreplaceable role in\r\nthe service of peace and security through peacekeeping\r\noperations and the promotion of international cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations Blue Helmets have already become\r\nsymbols of hope in the major areas of conflict throughout\r\nthe world. The Albanian Government sincerely hopes that\r\na lasting peace will be established in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Burundi, Liberia,\r\nand everywhere else.\r\nThe United Nations is undergoing the most severe\r\nfinancial crisis in its history. This year alone, the\r\nOrganization ran out of money in its regular budget three\r\ntimes and was therefore forced to borrow funds from its\r\npeacekeeping operations budget. The tasks of today and\r\nthe challenges of tomorrow require a general reform of\r\nthe entire United Nations system. Albania has actively\r\nparticipated in the debate on the preparatory process to\r\nreform the Security Council within the framework of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. Albania is in favour of increasing the\r\nsize of the Council by two permanent seats: Germany and\r\nJapan. We also believe that options should be considered\r\nthat relate to a broader representation of Member States,\r\nin order to make the Council more efficient and better\r\nable to fulfil its mandate.\r\nRevitalization of the Economic and Social Council\r\nmust be part of the reform process. We all firmly believe\r\nthat as long as wide economic gaps exist between North\r\nand South, and East and West, several peoples and\r\ncountries will face key problems related to their survival,\r\nand risks of tension, conflicts and regional hostility will\r\nprevail. For this reason, reform of the Security Council\r\nwill not aid the cause of global peace and stability if it is\r\nnot accompanied by an equally effective reform of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nAfter a long 50 years of communist rule, Albania has\r\nnow been a democracy for five years. During this period of\r\ndemocratic reform, it has had to face innumerable major\r\nproblems, including its communist heritage, with its\r\nassociated spirit of class struggle; and its extreme poverty\r\nand strict isolation. The country’s transition was rendered\r\nyet more difficult by the situation in the region, which was\r\nweighted down by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and\r\nthe related application of the sanctions regime for several\r\nyears. Nonetheless, Albania has been able to evolve from\r\na one-party to a multiple-party system; from repression to\r\nthe establishment of a State based on the rule of law and on\r\nrespect for human rights and minorities; from a highly\r\ncentralized and depressed economy to a growing, free-\r\nmarket economy; and from isolationism to openness to\r\nEuro-Atlantic integration.\r\nAlbania’s gross domestic product has increased\r\nannually, from 11 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent in 1996.\r\nInflation fell 400 per cent in 1992 and now stands at 7.5\r\nper cent in 1996. Our national currency’s exchange rate has\r\ngained some stability, and our foreign debt has been paid.\r\nAlthough five years ago the economy was totally\r\ncentralized, privatization is now proceeding rapidly in all\r\nthe major economic sectors; at present 75 per cent of\r\noverall production comes from the private sector. The\r\nunemployment rate has dropped from 39 per cent in 1992\r\nto 12 per cent in 1996. Within four years, Albania was able\r\nto completely liberalize prices.\r\nClearly, transforming a centralized economy into a\r\nmarket economy is difficult and sometimes painful,\r\nespecially for certain economic sectors and for certain\r\nsegments of the population. I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to again sincerely thank the European Union,\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nWorld Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment, the International Monetary Fund and a\r\nnumber of United Nations specialized agencies for the\r\nvaluable assistance they have provided to my country\r\nduring this period of transition. We are confident that these\r\ninstitutions will continue to help Albania.\r\nOver the past four years, Albania’s prestige in the\r\ninternational arena has increased considerably, giving proof\r\nof its priority Euro-Atlantic orientation. Albania is already\r\na member of the Council of Europe and an active\r\nparticipant in the Partnership for Peace, and is working for\r\nits full integration into the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization and the European Union. In this regard\r\nAlbania highly appreciates the support of the member\r\nStates of the European Union and is convinced that the time\r\nhas come to accelerate the process of Albania’s\r\nintegration. We also welcome the current progress being\r\nmade in solidifying our relations with the United States,\r\nwhich the Albanians consider to be the champion of\r\ndemocracy and freedom. We are confident that these\r\nrelations, which are of great importance to Albania, will\r\ncontinue to develop.\r\nAlbania’s regional policy is based on a desire to\r\npromote peace and stability in the Balkans. Given the\r\ngeo-strategic position of Albania, the deteriorating\r\nsituation of those Albanians living in exile in other\r\nBalkan countries, and the prolonged crisis in the former\r\nYugoslavia, the Albanian Government’s significant\r\ncontribution to regional peace and stability demonstrates\r\nits willingness to establish regional cooperation in line\r\nwith Euro-Atlantic trends. Determined to continue this\r\npolicy and to increase its contribution, Albania hosted the\r\nfirst Conference of South-Balkans Defence Ministers,\r\nwhich served as a first step leading to the Conference of\r\nthe Ministers for Foreign Affairs, held in Sofia some\r\nmonths later. As part of this contribution, my country has\r\njust established a peacekeeping unit, now serving in\r\nZadar, Croatia within the framework of the\r\nImplementation Force (IFOR).\r\nThe Albanian Government continues to believe that\r\nthe question of the Balkans requires greater attention by\r\nthe international community and by the United Nations in\r\nparticular. The bitter history of the region and the\r\nprolonged conflict of recent years have proved clearly that\r\nthe threat of war always looms large in countries where\r\nultra-nationalism and chauvinism hold sway. We all are\r\naware of the importance of the Dayton Agreement in\r\nresolving the conflict in the Balkans. We have always\r\nstressed the importance of identifying the major cause of\r\nthat conflict: Serb ultra-nationalism.\r\nWhile making a serious effort to assist in the\r\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Albania wishes once\r\nagain to draw the attention of the United Nations to the\r\nserious problem of Kosovo. In the 1980s, Kosovo —\r\nmore than 90 per cent of whose population consists of\r\nAlbanians who have lived on their own territory for\r\nthousands of years — was the first to speak of the danger\r\nthat Serb ultra-nationalism posed to the territories of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. National chauvinism; ethnic\r\nintolerance; racial, economic and religious discrimination;\r\n“ethnic cleansing”; and acts of violence and repression\r\nagainst an entire population — characteristic features of\r\nSerb policy — were demonstrated for the first time in\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nKosovo. In fact, the crisis in the former Yugoslavia began\r\nin Kosovo, though at that time the international community\r\npaid scant attention to what the Albanians were saying. It\r\nwas not until the crisis became a bloody conflict in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina that proper attention was paid.\r\nThe Kosovo issue must be duly examined and treated\r\nin the spirit of the Dayton Agreement. It is now considered\r\none of the serious international issues that must be resolved,\r\nand it has been the subject of several documents and\r\ndecisions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe and of the United Nations. However, the situation\r\nin Kosovo is still tense and volatile. The fact that up to\r\nnow an armed conflict between the Albanians living in\r\nKosovo and the Serbs has been avoided — or rather,\r\nresisted — is primarily the result of the peaceful policy\r\npursued by the legitimate political representatives of the\r\npeople of Kosovo, and of the foreign policy of the Albanian\r\nGovernment.\r\nWe believe that Kosovo deserves a status that reflects\r\nthe political will of its people as well as the international\r\ninstruments relating to the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination. The agreement on education in Kosovo,\r\nrecently reached by representatives of Kosovo and\r\nBelgrade, is a promising step towards further efforts fully\r\nto guarantee the Kosovo Albanians basic freedoms and\r\nhuman and national rights. The Government of the Republic\r\nof Albania believes that through constructive dialogue, in\r\nthe presence of a credible international third party, a\r\nsolution to this acute problem can be found.\r\nWe thank the General Assembly for its consideration\r\nof the situation in Kosovo, particularly through its\r\nresolutions 49/204 of 23 December 1994 and 50/190 of 22\r\nDecember 1995. We would like to take this opportunity to\r\nappeal once again to the international community to\r\ncontinue its efforts until this issue is definitively resolved.\r\nAlbania’s foreign policy is characterized by efforts to\r\nestablish good relations with its neighbours. Albania has\r\nalways been in favour of peace, stability, and economic and\r\ncultural cooperation with its neighbouring countries.\r\nAlbania and Greece have been able to establish good\r\nrelations, which are expanding and strengthening. The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Albania and the Albanian\r\npeople are grateful to the Government and the people of\r\nGreece for having supported us during our difficult period\r\nof transition. The current positive developments in\r\nAlbanian-Greek relations show, to our great pleasure, that\r\nin bilateral relations all problems can be solved\r\nsatisfactorily and within a reasonable time-frame if there is\r\npolitical good will and a serious commitment by both\r\nsides. The friendly relations between our two countries\r\nare concrete testimony of the achievements of both the\r\nGreek and the Albanian Governments. Good relations\r\nbetween two neighbouring countries such as Albania and\r\nGreece show that the existence of national minorities in\r\nneighbouring countries can serve as a bridge of friendship\r\nand become a connective link between countries. The\r\nrecognition and equal treatment of national minorities,\r\ncoupled with respect for the independence, sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of each State, are essential\r\nelements in such relations.\r\nThe Albanian Government has taken steps to show\r\nits interest in establishing mutually beneficial relations\r\nwith the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nAlbania was among the first countries to officially\r\nrecognize that State, while at the same time assuring it of\r\nour readiness to work with it to establish stronger\r\nrelations in all fields, independently of the problems\r\nrelating to the situation and the position of those\r\nAlbanians living in that State. My country believes that\r\nthe normalization and improvement of relations with\r\nSerbia and Montenegro depends on Belgrade taking\r\ncertain steps, such as respecting the Dayton Agreement,\r\ntaking concrete measures to put an end to the violence\r\nagainst and the suppression of the rights of the Albanians\r\nin Kosovo, and making a serious commitment to a\r\npeaceful solution to the Kosovo question.\r\nAlbania attaches particular importance to its relations\r\nwith its western neighbour, Italy. This ancient relationship\r\nhas lasted as long as our peoples have lived in the\r\nMediterranean. In the framework of the European Union,\r\nItaly has been one of the main donors to Albania. We are\r\nvery grateful to the Italian Government and people for the\r\ntremendous assistance they have given our country during\r\nthis difficult period of transition, and for the spirit of\r\ngood will that has always prevailed in our relations. We\r\nbelieve these things provide a solid basis for further\r\npositive developments in the future.\r\nBefore concluding my address before the Assembly,\r\nallow me to assure members, on behalf of the Albanian\r\nGovernment, of our continued support for the activities of\r\nthe United Nations. We will continue to contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of the Organization and of its irreplaceable\r\nrole in the service of peace, security, progress and\r\ndemocracy throughout the world. My small country,\r\nAlbania, will always be committed to contribute actively\r\nto all the work of the Organization.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey,\r\nHer Excellency Ms. Tansu Çiller.\r\nMs. Çiller (Turkey): I should like to congratulate\r\nwarmly Mr. Razali on his election to the high office of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. I am confident that\r\nunder his wise and able guidance our deliberations will be\r\nmost successful. I should also like to thank His Excellency\r\nMr. Do Amaral for his most valuable contribution to the\r\nwork of the previous session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe have just left behind 50 years in the life of this\r\nuniversal Organization, which was founded with the ideal\r\nof serving and guiding humankind in its common quest to\r\nmake the world a better place to live. The commemoration\r\nlast year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nmarked an important milestone in our journey. Yet we find\r\nthat our common pursuit of a new and more promising\r\norder of international relations is far from its goal. The new\r\nexpectations and hopes that the end of the cold-war era\r\ninstilled in us all have, unfortunately, been short-lived.\r\nIndeed, such dark forces as extreme ethnic nationalism,\r\naggression, hegemonistic tendencies, intolerance, racism,\r\nxenophobia and terrorism have been unleashed to wreak\r\nhavoc on a global scale. At the same time, economic, social\r\nand environmental problems, as well as risks in the military\r\nsecurity realm, have assumed global proportions.\r\nNo country can claim to be immune from any of the\r\nproblems we are facing today, which need common\r\nsolutions. In fact, there is an emerging consensus that more\r\nthan ever, our common problems require global solutions,\r\nwhich must be formulated in a spirit of solidarity and\r\ncooperation. This spirit can find concrete expression only\r\nwithin this Organization, which continues to be the only\r\nglobal forum for collective cooperation and effective\r\ninternational action. Therefore, it is our duty to generations\r\nto come to refashion this institution so as to further\r\nstrengthen it and equip it with the means to meet the\r\nchallenge of the new era that begins with the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nAs we embark on the second half-century of our\r\nOrganization, it is high time that the international\r\ncommunity reassess the ways and means by which it can\r\ngive a new impetus to the efforts aimed at building a better\r\nand more secure future for all humankind. Substantial work\r\nto this end has already been carried out within the United\r\nNations system. In particular, the series of major\r\nconferences on basic issues of common concern laid the\r\ngroundwork for future action. The chain of these\r\nconferences, which began with the 1990 World Summit\r\nfor Children and ended with the Conference on Human\r\nSettlements in Istanbul this past June, has covered\r\nvirtually every aspect of human interest. The declarations\r\nand programmes of action they adopted will serve as our\r\nroad map in our efforts to achieve their final objectives.\r\nIt was a distinct privilege for Turkey to host, in\r\nIstanbul this year, the last major international conference\r\nof the century, Habitat II. That conference played an\r\ninstrumental role in creating a greater awareness that\r\nadequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements\r\nin a rapidly urbanizing and globalizing world are the\r\ncommon challenges before us. The Istanbul Declaration\r\nand the Habitat Agenda will be our guiding instruments\r\nto meet these challenges. We attach great importance to\r\nthe follow-up of that successful conference.\r\nAlthough criticized at times for its limitations, the\r\nUnited Nations has nevertheless played a crucial role in\r\nthe search for global solutions to the problems\r\nencountered in every field of human endeavour. Yet the\r\nchallenges that it will face in the twenty-first century will\r\nprobably be far greater and more formidable than ever\r\nbefore, and the United Nations, therefore, has to promptly\r\nadapt to changing times. For this reason, we support the\r\nongoing reform process within the United Nations. In this\r\nrespect, streamlining, rationalizing, revitalizing and\r\nrestructuring the United Nations system and its work are\r\nthe widely accepted components needed to bring about a\r\nmore effective, responsive, representative, democratic and\r\naccountable world Organization. These modifications,\r\nwhich are currently under intense consideration at various\r\nlevels, will, to a large extent, determine the effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations in the years to come.\r\nSince January 1994, the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and\r\nother matters has been formulating a set of guidelines for\r\nthe ongoing reform process. The general issue before us\r\nhere is the enhancement of the representative character of\r\nthe Security Council and the democratization of its\r\nmethod of work. Strongly in favour of a comprehensive\r\nreform, Turkey last year formally introduced a proposal\r\nfor the enlargement of the Security Council. As the\r\nrepresentative character of the Council has, despite minor\r\nadjustments, eroded steadily, we believe that a Council\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nwith at least 25 members would be more representative and\r\nthus more effective. We hold the view that the Council\r\nshould be enlarged by 10 additional non-permanent\r\nmembers and that the proposed new additional seats should\r\nrotate among a predetermined list of about 30 to 40\r\ncountries. These countries should be selected within the\r\ngeographical groups according to a set of objective criteria\r\nthat can be modified, of course, in time. The list would\r\nconsequently be flexible and updated after a certain period\r\nof time to conform to arising new conditions.\r\nAs regards to its working methods and procedures, the\r\nCouncil has already taken some important steps. There is,\r\nhowever, a widespread belief that these steps fall short of\r\nthe legitimate expectations of the great majority of the\r\nMember States. Hence, more work needs to be done in this\r\nsphere, especially on questions on which important\r\ndifferences still exist.\r\nOn the other hand, the Open-ended High-level\r\nWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nSystem is in the process of formulating recommendations\r\nfor reform, with the General Assembly and the Secretariat\r\nas its main areas of interest. Turkey favours the\r\ncontinuation of the mandate of the Working Group to\r\nenable it to complete its work.\r\nThe challenges and risks we face in the military\r\nsecurity field call for measures that are broad in scope and\r\napplication. This feature alone underscores the unique\r\nmandate and authority of the United Nations to address\r\nthese challenges in their global dimensions. Arms control\r\nand disarmament — focusing distinctly and with a sense of\r\nurgency on measures and regimes destined to curb the\r\nalarming trends in the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and in the technologies for their means of\r\ndelivery — must remain high on our agenda.\r\nTurkey, as a Member State of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, is pleased to have joined the overwhelming\r\nmajority of nations in the efforts to conclude and adopt the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Treaty,\r\nwhich I signed on 24 September, constitutes an\r\nindispensable step towards the eventual goal of a world free\r\nof nuclear weapons.\r\nAccumulation of conventional weapons beyond\r\nlegitimate defense needs is inherently destabilizing.\r\nDevising responsible policies to be globally adhered to in\r\narms transfers, with due regard to the impact of such\r\ntransfers on regional and international stability, is not a\r\nlesser priority. We must ensure that the United Nations\r\nRegister of Conventional Arms becomes a more effective\r\ntool for monitoring and for transparency in transfers. On\r\na parallel track, the international community must\r\nvigorously pursue a more concerted effort to eradicate\r\nillicit arms trafficking, not solely as an arms and export-\r\ncontrol measure, but more importantly as a key\r\ncomponent in the international fight against terrorism.\r\nOne of the most daunting tasks before the United\r\nNations is to foster greater international solidarity and\r\nconcerted action against terrorism. We should not shy\r\naway from the responsibility to meet this challenge head-\r\non, because terrorism not only poses a threat to\r\ninternational peace and stability, but also violates the most\r\nfundamental human right of all: the very right to live.\r\nInternational cooperation is imperative if we choose to\r\nlive free of fear. The United Nations has to play a central\r\nrole in this respect. General Assembly resolutions on\r\nhuman rights and terrorism and a Declaration on\r\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism are\r\nsignificant milestones, paving the way for effective\r\ninternational cooperation to eradicate this common enemy.\r\nIn combating terrorism, we should not lose sight of the\r\nfact that what is equally important is to fight against, and\r\nnot to condone, the countries that are behind it.\r\nTransnational organized crime, with its connections to\r\ndrug trafficking and terrorist organizations, also poses a\r\nserious threat to the stability of our societies. We will\r\ncontinue to vigorously support international cooperation\r\nto combat this evil.\r\nIn 1995, we also celebrated the United Nations Year\r\nfor Tolerance. A culture of tolerance — which is vital for\r\nconsolidating democracy and preventing ethnic conflicts,\r\nracist tendencies and xenophobia — has been promoted\r\nthrough various international and regional activities under\r\nthe umbrella of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Current\r\ndevelopments unmistakably demonstrate how crucial it is\r\nto keep this precious concept alive within society and in\r\nbilateral, regional and international relations. We attach\r\ngreat importance to the follow-up of the Year and will\r\npresent a draft resolution under the relevant agenda item\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nLocated on the fault line of several regions fraught\r\nwith conflicts and instability, Turkey naturally is seriously\r\nconcerned by developments on its periphery that threaten\r\nregional and international peace and security. We have\r\nbeen playing a crucial role in the efforts to find lasting\r\nand just solutions to the current problems. We are also\r\nactively taking part in various United Nations initiatives,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nincluding peacekeeping operations and preventive\r\ndiplomacy activities.\r\nTurning to one of the questions that is high on our\r\nagenda, our fundamental policy towards Iraq continues to\r\nbe our commitment to the territorial integrity, sovereignty\r\nand independence of that country. The full compliance by\r\nIraq with all of its obligations under international law and\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions remains vital for the\r\nreturn to normalcy in the region. Our main objective here\r\nis the restoration of peace, stability and security on our\r\nborders, as well as in the region as a whole. We are closely\r\nfollowing the recent developments in northern Iraq, which\r\nmay further aggravate the already delicate situation in the\r\nregion. To bring durable calm to the area, all segments of\r\nthe local population — Kurds, Turkomans in particular,\r\nsince they have not been mentioned up to this point to the\r\nextent that they deserve; Arabs; Assyrians; and others —\r\nshould fully participate in any local administrative\r\narrangement, and their rights should be guaranteed.\r\nNorthern Iraq should not be permitted to serve as an area\r\nthat poses a threat to the security of the neighbouring\r\ncountries. Turkey will not tolerate terrorist elements using\r\nnorthern Iraq to stage terrorist acts against its territory. We\r\nare determined to take all necessary measures to protect our\r\nlegitimate security interests and to deny terrorist elements\r\nthe possibility of launching terrorist operations against our\r\npopulation from northern Iraq.\r\nWe have fulfilled our responsibilities emanating from\r\nthe sanctions regime against Iraq, despite the extreme\r\neconomic burden this has entailed for our country. More\r\nthan six years after the sanctions’ inception, Turkey is now\r\nat the forefront of the countries that have been directly and\r\nmost adversely affected by the sanctions regime. In fact, the\r\nheavy toll we have been required to pay has long exceeded\r\nour ability to sustain the financial strain on our economy,\r\nnor can we pay it any longer. Security Council resolution\r\n986 (1995), when implemented, will alleviate the suffering\r\nof the Iraqi people while also bringing limited relief for\r\nTurkey. However, this relief can in no way be\r\ncommensurate with our losses. Consequently, we have\r\napplied to the United Nations Sanctions Committee with a\r\nview to obtaining further appropriate compensation within\r\nthe framework of the sanctions regime. In this context, I\r\nwish to reiterate that we attach great importance to the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995)\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nIn the wider context of the Middle East, we are\r\nconcerned about what we hope will be only a temporary\r\nimpasse in the Middle East peace process. As a devoted\r\nsupporter of the peace process, which we regard as the\r\nonly viable alternative for the region, we desire to see it\r\npick up its momentum. This indisputably requires the\r\nparties to live up to their commitments.\r\nAs we underlined in our statement before the\r\nSecurity Council on 27 September, any action that may\r\nadversely affect the peace process should be avoided. The\r\nIsraeli decision to open an entrance to a tunnel in the\r\nvicinity of the Mosque and the chain of reactions it\r\nprovoked are of that nature. We are deeply saddened by\r\nthe high number of casualties. We call on both sides to\r\nexercise utmost restraint and to prevent further violence.\r\nWe urge the Israeli Government to review its decision\r\nand to refrain from any action that can be construed as\r\nprovocation and from resorting to the use of force. We\r\nwelcome Security Council resolution 1073 (1996). We\r\nexpect President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to\r\nmeet immediately to find a way out of this crisis.\r\nOne of the main obstacles blocking the path to a\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East continues to be\r\nterrorism. It must be eliminated if the quest for a lasting\r\npeace and stability is to prevail. We advocate and stand\r\nready to take part in enhanced cooperation on the\r\nbilateral, regional and international levels. Similarly, we\r\nexpect all countries to do their share to this very end. It\r\nis with this understanding that we participated in the\r\nsummit of Sharm el-Sheikh, convened to demonstrate the\r\nresolve of the international community to fight against\r\nterrorism on a united front. The eventual success of the\r\npeace process will also hinge on our collective ability to\r\npromote mutually beneficial economic cooperation and\r\ninterdependence among the countries of the Middle East.\r\nAs a Balkan country, we firmly believe that peace,\r\njustice and legitimacy in the Balkans remain vital for\r\ninternational peace and stability. We hold the view that\r\nany cooperative scheme in the Balkans should include all\r\nand exclude none. We were profoundly distressed for a\r\nlong time that, during the disintegration of the former\r\nYugoslavia, lack of resolute international intervention at\r\nthe very outset of the aggression and war led to\r\nbloodshed and atrocities unparalleled in recent history.\r\nThe developments that took place prior to the Dayton\r\npeace Agreement proved once again that turning a blind\r\neye to aggression only further aggravates crisis situations,\r\ncausing untold human suffering and making it all the\r\nmore difficult to find solutions.\r\nWe are actively participating in the implementation\r\nof both the military and civilian aspects of the Dayton\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\npeace Agreement, and in the international efforts to\r\nreconstruct and rehabilitate Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\r\nare also conducting, together with the United States, a joint\r\nprogramme to train and equip the army of the Federation of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina in order to provide the Federation\r\nwith the means to preserve its territorial integrity and to\r\nensure military parity.\r\nWe welcome the recently held elections in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. We consider the realization of these elections,\r\ndespite existing hardships, an important development for\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina’s future. We hope that this\r\ndevelopment will lead to the creation of a positive political\r\nclimate conducive to the attainment of lasting peace and\r\nstability and to the establishment of the constitutional,\r\nlegislative, administrative and security structures of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. We urge the international community to\r\nremain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\r\nto remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of that country; to\r\nensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their\r\nhomes; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of\r\nindicted war criminals; to prevent any negative outside\r\ninterference that could potentially impede the process of\r\npeaceful and democratic reintegration; and to make\r\navailable the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation of Bosnia.\r\nTurkey enjoys good-neighbourly relations with the\r\nBalkan countries. However, a number of issues between\r\nTurkey and Greece, mostly related to the Aegean, remain\r\nunresolved. We have always advocated that disputes should\r\nbe settled by peaceful means and through dialogue and\r\nconstructive negotiations. Consequently, we have made\r\nseveral appeals to Greece to seek an overall solution to all\r\nthe existing issues that stand between us. However, this\r\ndoes not mean that we would accept any fait accompli. We\r\nstill expect Greece to give these appeals the full\r\nconsideration and positive response they deserve. We would\r\nlike to hope that the new Greek Government, emerging\r\nfrom the recent elections, will adopt a more forthcoming\r\nstance in this regard. Unfortunately, the recent statement of\r\nthe Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, from this very\r\nrostrum on 27 September, does not bode well. Distortion\r\nand misrepresentation of the established facts, as well as\r\nunfounded and unjustified allegations, will not serve the\r\ncreation of the climate of confidence and friendship we\r\nwish to see in our bilateral relations.\r\nIn Cyprus, in the period that has elapsed since the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly, regrettably no noticeable\r\ndevelopments have taken place towards a comprehensive\r\nsettlement. It has not been possible to resume the direct\r\ntalks between the two sides under the mission of good\r\noffices of the United Nations Secretary-General, due to\r\nthe negative stance of the Greek Cypriots. The Greek\r\nCypriot side continues not to acknowledge that, in the\r\npast, the United Nations negotiating process and direct\r\ndialogue between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot\r\nleaders not only served to establish the key parameters of\r\na final settlement — which are already on the table —\r\nbut also played an important role in defusing tensions\r\nbetween the two communities. It is all too evident that\r\nattempts to derail the United Nations negotiating process\r\ncan only further complicate the already difficult road to\r\na just solution.\r\nThe recent regrettable events in and around the\r\nbuffer zone and, especially the slaying of a Turkish\r\nCypriot soldier, have proven once again what the lack of\r\ndialogue as well as inflammatory rhetoric and provocation\r\ncan lead to. I hope that the Greek Cypriot side will not\r\nfail this time to draw the necessary conclusions. It is\r\nevident that the need to reduce tensions and build up\r\nconfidence on the island makes the resumption of the\r\ndirect talks, without any precondition, all the more urgent.\r\nThe Turkish Cypriot side has already made public its\r\nreadiness to this end. Turkey is committed to supporting\r\nthe renewed efforts of the United Nations and expects the\r\nsame constructive approach from Greece and the Greek\r\nCypriot side.\r\nPeace and legitimacy are yet to be restored in\r\nanother area of conflagration: the Caucasus. Indeed, this\r\nregion continues to be wracked by various conflicts, that\r\ncause immense human anguish and threaten peace,\r\nsecurity and stability. Turkey has close bonds with the\r\ncountries of the region and attaches utmost importance to\r\nthe preservation of regional peace and stability. The\r\nongoing occupation of more than one fifth of the territory\r\nof Azerbaijan by Armenian forces continues to be a\r\nsource of grave concern for Turkey. More than one\r\nmillion Azeris are still displaced in their own country and\r\nliving in unacceptable conditions.\r\nThey should not be permitted to endure another\r\nbitter winter in such conditions. Turkey has been striving\r\nto help bring about a peaceful and just settlement of the\r\ndispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We will\r\ncontinue to contribute to the efforts of the Minsk Group\r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope with a view to establishing peace, security and\r\nstability in the region. We earnestly believe that all\r\ncountries in the region have much to gain from the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nrestoration of peace and legitimacy in the Caucasus. The\r\nattainment of a just peace will pave the way for a climate\r\nof cooperation to serve the common prosperity of all the\r\ncountries of the region.\r\nThe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, also continues to\r\nbe a source of distress. We attach the utmost importance to\r\nthe preservation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and\r\nunity of Georgia and firmly believe that the international\r\ncommunity should deploy all efforts to bring about a just\r\nsolution to the conflict on that basis. To this end, we fully\r\nsupport the United Nations-sponsored peace talks between\r\nthe parties and stand ready to contribute to those efforts.\r\nOne of the important aspects of the economic\r\ndevelopment of the Caucasus and Central Asia is the\r\nexportation of their natural resources, for which Turkey is\r\nin a position to provide easy access to world markets. I can\r\nmention here Turkey’s proposed Baku-Ceyhan oil-pipeline\r\nproject and natural-gas pipeline projects, which will serve\r\nthe common interests and welfare of the entire region.\r\nAfghanistan is yet another conflict area where the\r\ninternational community has been unable to help bring\r\nabout a just and lasting solution. Our close ties with that\r\ncountry are deeply rooted in history and we are troubled by\r\nthe tragic consequences of the ongoing conflict. We are all\r\ntoo aware of the possibility of a spillover effect of the\r\nconflict in the region. We believe that this terrible conflict\r\nmay be brought to an end and peace restored through direct\r\nnegotiations between the fighting groups and the formation\r\nof a broad-based Government with the participation of all\r\nparties. Turkey is anxious to see, as soon as possible, the\r\nsigning of a ceasefire agreement and the beginning of peace\r\nnegotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. We\r\nwill be pleased to host a meeting for such negotiations and\r\nwill continue to support fully the efforts of the United\r\nNations Special Mission to mediate a settlement respecting\r\nthe territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nAs an extension of its geography and against the\r\nbackdrop of its history, Turkey finds itself at the\r\nmultidirectional crossroads of several continents and\r\ndifferent cultures. It acts as an important bridge between\r\nEast and West, combining the values of the East with the\r\nideals and institutions of the West in a unique synthesis.\r\nStrong historical, cultural and fraternal ties exist between\r\nTurkey and the countries of the Balkans, the Caucasus,\r\nCentral Asia and the Middle East. We spare no effort in\r\ncontributing to the resolution of conflicts and preventing\r\nnew ones from erupting, strengthening regional and\r\ninternational cooperation and promoting tolerance and\r\ndialogue. This is the very core and essence of the basic\r\nprinciples that define our foreign policy. We shall\r\ncontinue to place our assets at the disposal and service of\r\nregional and global peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nIn this context, I wish to underline the eminent role\r\nplayed by Turkey in such regional cooperation schemes\r\nas the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization, as well as its active\r\nparticipation in cooperation in the Mediterranean basin.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our sincere desire\r\nto see the fifty-first session of the General Assembly\r\nbecome an important milestone on the road to the third\r\nmillennium. We have to gather our strength, pool our\r\nresources and ignite our imagination to build, collectively,\r\na better world. National interests and objectives will\r\nsurely remain at the core of our policies. However, on the\r\neve of a new millennium, the time has certainly come to\r\ntake a broader view and to replace rivalry with\r\ncooperation, intolerance with tolerance and confrontation\r\nwith dialogue and conciliation. We should at all costs\r\navoid faits accomplis and double standards in\r\ninternational relations. A revitalized and reinvigorated\r\nUnited Nations entering its second half-century can make\r\na significant contribution to assisting us all to attain our\r\nhighest goals and aspirations. Let us not forget, however,\r\nthat the task of shaping a better future is entirely in our\r\nhands, for we are the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, the Honourable\r\nAlexander Downer.\r\nMr. Downer (Australia): I should like to extend\r\nwarm congratulations to Mr. Razali on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. As a close neighbour\r\nof Malaysia, Australia will confidently rely on his\r\nexperience and sound judgement as he presides over this\r\nimportant session of the Assembly.\r\nI feel greatly honoured to be leading for the first\r\ntime the Australian delegation to a session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nA year ago, when the Assembly adopted the\r\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, it made an important promise: to\r\ngive to the twenty-first century a United Nations that\r\nwould serve effectively the peoples in whose name it was\r\nestablished. We must keep that promise, but to do so we\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nwill need a clear view of contemporary circumstances and\r\nof those which we can see unfolding into the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe landscape that was revealed at the end of the cold\r\nwar, just a little over five years ago, has many new\r\nfeatures, some of which are still not clear. What is clear,\r\nhowever, is that we face new challenges and that we have\r\nnew opportunities that few of us would have imagined five\r\nyears ago.\r\nThe most compelling of these opportunities is to take\r\nfuture steps in nuclear-arms control and disarmament. The\r\npossibility of taking such steps is surely a principal\r\noutcome of the end of the cold war. This was firmly\r\nunderlined last Tuesday when, in a single day, 67 countries\r\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. That\r\nnumber, only a week later, is now nearly 100. But beyond\r\nthis achievement lies another major opportunity, which is\r\nto turn our national and international attention to enhancing\r\nhuman security in all its aspects.\r\nOur dynamic times have presented us with new\r\nproblems. Such problems include the major non-military\r\nthreats to security: the clandestine arms trade, the narcotics\r\ntrade, HIV/AIDS, the need to stabilize the rate of growth of\r\nthe world’s population and major threats to the\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe elemental characteristics of such non-military\r\nthreats to security are that they cannot be defeated by\r\nweapons. They cross state boundaries and they can affect\r\nwhole populations. These characteristics lead to one central\r\nconclusion, that is, action on these problems must be the\r\nsubject of international cooperation.\r\nMultilateral cooperation can, does and must take many\r\nforms. But the role of the United Nations is unique because\r\nof its universality and because of the rules we find in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIt is for these reasons — the nature of the\r\nopportunities we have before us, the problems we face and\r\nthe unique role and capability of the United Nations — that\r\nwe must keep last year’s promise of a United Nations fit\r\nfor the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nAustralia’s particular commitment to the United\r\nNations is founded on the belief, articulated as far back as\r\nthe 1950s by the then Foreign Minister, Richard Casey, that\r\nthe United Nations represents the practical effort of the\r\nGovernments and peoples of the world to attain the high\r\ngoals to which they are pledged through the United\r\nNations Charter: international peace and security and the\r\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples.\r\nAustralia has contributed readily to achieving those\r\ngoals. Whether by paying its financial contributions in full\r\nand on time, by providing personnel to peacekeeping\r\noperations or through its contributions to development\r\nprogrammes, Australia has been determined to see the\r\nUnited Nations succeed. I commit Australia today to\r\ncontinuing such involvement in the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAt present, a window of opportunity in arms control\r\nand disarmament is open to us. If we do not take it soon,\r\nit will close. Large and sophisticated nuclear and\r\nconventional arsenals continue to exist. In a number of\r\nregions, suspicions remain close to the surface. The risks\r\nof the spread of weapons of mass destruction have, in\r\ncertain respects, increased.\r\nIn Australia’s view, two tasks are fundamental: first,\r\nbuilding and strengthening international institutions and\r\ninstruments; and secondly, developing new thinking in\r\narms control and disarmament so as to push the\r\ninternational agenda forward in constructive and realistic\r\nways.\r\nTo achieve progress with institutions and\r\ninstruments, Members of the United Nations need to work\r\ntogether on at least six priorities. These priorities for\r\ninternational cooperation are to make the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its enhanced\r\nreview process operate more effectively; to strengthen the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; to\r\nachieve an early start for the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons; to reach early\r\nagreement on effective verification machinery for the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention; to pursue the goal of a\r\nglobal ban on anti-personnel landmines in conjunction\r\nwith a global approach to the problem of demining; and\r\nto achieve a ban on the production of fissile materials for\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nAs we pursue these priorities in the multilateral\r\nsystem, we should keep firmly in mind that progress in\r\nregional security, particularly in regions of weapons-\r\nproliferation concern, will make a crucial contribution.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is of\r\ncourse the immediate priority. Its adoption by the General\r\nAssembly and its opening for signature on 24 September\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nwere major milestones for the international community. The\r\nTreaty is a product of our times. It flows from a long and\r\ncommonly held global concern. Its death was something the\r\ninternational community simply could not allow.\r\nAustralia was therefore prepared to take the lead in\r\nbringing the Treaty to the General Assembly. The\r\noverwhelming support for the resolution demonstrated the\r\nstrength of international feeling against nuclear testing. This\r\nTreaty was wanted and needed, but it has also helped\r\nchange the international climate. We can now reasonably\r\nhope and expect that nuclear testing will not be part of the\r\nfuture to be faced by succeeding generations. In a world\r\nwith a mixed history on controlling the development and\r\nspread of destructive weaponry, that is something of which\r\nwe can all be proud.\r\nThe Treaty must become universal. We urge all those\r\ncountries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the\r\nTreaty as soon as possible so that it can be fully\r\nimplemented as quickly as possible. There is no merit in\r\nthe argument that says that, because there is more to be\r\ndone in nuclear-arms control and disarmament, we should\r\nin some way scorn or reject a Treaty that bans all nuclear\r\nexplosions forever. This ban has intrinsic value. We must\r\nnow keep up the positive momentum generated by the\r\nadoption of the Treaty.\r\nThis brings me to the second task: developing new\r\nideas. Because building institutions and strengthening\r\ninternational instruments will not be enough, the\r\ninternational community must also develop imaginative new\r\nways of guiding the world into the next century.\r\nThe Australian Government established the Canberra\r\nCommission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons to\r\naddress the questions of whether a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nworld is feasible and, if so, the measures which could be\r\ntaken to attain that objective. I am delighted to confirm that\r\nthe Commission has more than met Australia’s\r\nexpectations. Its report will make a major contribution to\r\ninternational thinking and discussion on nuclear\r\ndisarmament. The Australian Government will take it\r\nforward by circulating it today in this Hall, will present it\r\nto the Secretary-General tomorrow and introduce it to the\r\nConference on Disarmament in January.\r\nThe Canberra Commission report recommends a\r\npolitical commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. That is the first and central\r\nrequirement. The report then sets out six immediate steps:\r\ntaking nuclear forces off alert; removal of warheads from\r\ndelivery vehicles; ending the deployment of non-strategic\r\nnuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; initiating\r\nnegotiations further to reduce United States and Russian\r\nnuclear arsenals; and an agreement among the nuclear-\r\nweapon States on reciprocal no-first-use undertakings and\r\nof a non-use undertaking by them in relation to the\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States.\r\nThe Commission also recommends three reinforcing\r\nsteps: action to prevent further horizontal proliferation;\r\ndeveloping verification arrangements for a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world; and the cessation of the production of\r\nfissile material for nuclear-explosive purposes. The\r\nCommission placed particular emphasis on the importance\r\nof effective verification in the achievement and\r\nmaintenance of a nuclear-weapons-free world.\r\nHaving at last, after 33 years, met the challenge of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the\r\ninternational community must now push on with further\r\npractical and realistic measures on nuclear-arms control\r\nand disarmament.\r\nAs already indicated, one such measure is the\r\nnegotiation of a convention under which it would be\r\nagreed that there will be no further manufacturing of\r\nweapons-grade fissile material. This convention should be\r\nsought now.\r\nAny discussion of arms control and disarmament in\r\ntoday’s world that failed to address the question of\r\nlandmines would be sadly incomplete. These hideous and\r\ndiabolically inexpensive weapons must be banned.\r\nAustralia will support efforts that will be made at this\r\nsession of the Assembly to take the next step towards the\r\nnegotiation of an international convention to that effect.\r\nBut in the meantime, there are in excess of 100\r\nmillion of these maiming weapons distributed in the soil\r\nof too many countries. Demining must proceed at a far\r\nfaster rate than has been the case in the past. There have\r\nbeen technological barriers to increasing that rate and\r\nAustralia has therefore proposed that a technology\r\nworking group be established among interested and\r\ncapable countries with the purpose of designing the\r\nequipment required for demining on a far larger and\r\nquicker scale.\r\nIf there is any doubt about the need for this action,\r\nI would place on record here that, if the current rate of\r\ndemining in Cambodia were to be maintained, that\r\ncountry, which has struggled so hard to repair itself,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nwould not be free of these mines for a further 130 years.\r\nThis must be unacceptable to all. That is why the\r\nAustralian Government recently committed $12 million to\r\npractical demining initiatives in the war-ravaged fields\r\nwithin our own region.\r\nSecurity Council reform is another vitally important\r\nitem on the peace-and-security agenda. The three key issues\r\nto be tackled are expansion, transparency and the\r\neffectiveness of sanctions regimes.\r\nThere is now a general acceptance that the Security\r\nCouncil must be expanded and modernized if it is to\r\nmanage international peace and security more effectively.\r\nAlthough Australia wants to avoid making the Council too\r\nunwieldy, there can be little doubt that its membership\r\nneeds to reflect better current geopolitical and economic\r\ncircumstances. Expanding the membership is an important\r\nelement in achieving this and Australia believes that an\r\nexpansion up to a total Council membership of 25 States\r\nwould be reasonable.\r\nThis brings me to the more contentious point of\r\npermanent as against non-permanent membership. Australia\r\nhas made clear that it supports the claims of Japan and\r\nGermany to permanent membership. This is the very least\r\nthe United Nations can do to acknowledge their major-\r\nPower status and the financial contribution they are making\r\nto the Organization.\r\nAustralia also advocates permanent seats on the\r\nCouncil for underrepresented regions. As to how that is to\r\nbe achieved, we remain flexible. Whether those seats are\r\nfilled by a single member or rotate among leading Member\r\nStates agreed on by regional groupings needs to be\r\ndiscussed further, primarily by those regions concerned. We\r\nalso see scope for an increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent members of the Council, again in the\r\ninterests of ensuring greater balance in representation.\r\nI turn now to the need for greater transparency in\r\nSecurity Council processes. Consultative mechanisms have\r\nimproved in recent times, notably between the Secretariat\r\nand troop-contributing countries, but more needs to be\r\ndone. Australia is committed to trying to improve the way\r\nin which the Security Council interacts with non-members\r\nso that the Council’s activities become more responsive to\r\nthe United Nations as a whole.\r\nMore needs to be done, too, to build the Council’s\r\nrelationship with regional organizations. Good progress has\r\nbeen recorded to date, but United Nations and regional\r\norganizations should meet regularly in order to develop\r\nfurther the appropriate division of responsibilities.\r\nThe Council also has an important role to play in\r\npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and enhancing the effectiveness of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime.\r\nAustralia wants to see improvements in the\r\neffectiveness of United Nations sanctions because we\r\nrecognize that the Security Council’s use of collective\r\nsanctions continues to be an important and, at times,\r\ncontentious enforcement measure. The effectiveness of\r\nsanctions regimes could be improved in three ways:\r\nclearer drafting of Security Council resolutions; providing\r\nspecific objectives and realistic time-frames; and through\r\nrelevant sanctions committees providing clear\r\ninterpretative guidance on implementation. These are\r\nchanges that are essential for the Security Council’s\r\ndynamism. We need to press ahead with them to ensure\r\nthat the Council reflects modern-day circumstances and\r\nrealities.\r\nOur contemporary circumstances have opened up\r\nnew needs and prospects for peacekeeping and preventive\r\ndiplomacy. Initial post-cold-war hopes about the\r\ncapabilities of the Security Council have been tempered.\r\nIt has become clear that many conflicts are intractable.\r\nExperience has taught us that it is difficult to reach\r\nagreement on suitable approaches and to find enough\r\nresources, particularly in the area of peacekeeping.\r\nThe Security Council must be realistic in the\r\nimplementation of its Charter responsibilities. It must\r\nresist pressure to embark on missions before it has\r\ncompleted adequate preparations, developed a focused\r\nsense of the mission’s goals and agreed on a clearly\r\narticulated mandate.\r\nAt this very moment, the United Nations is\r\nconfronted with major challenges in such diverse\r\nsituations as those in Cyprus, Burundi and Liberia.\r\nAustralia has been contributing personnel to the United\r\nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, for example, for\r\nover 20 years and has been saddened by the recent\r\nincidents of violence there. The time has come to resolve\r\nthat situation, which requires the assistance of all parties.\r\nOne very important area of reform for United\r\nNations peacekeeping is to establish an enhanced rapid-\r\nreaction capability. There have been many proposals on\r\nthis issue, but the Australian Government believes that the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nCanadian study, Towards a Rapid Reaction Capability for\r\nthe United Nations, contains some commendable\r\nrecommendations, including the development of a\r\ndeployable, operational-level headquarters to strengthen\r\nplanning for operations.\r\nAustralia welcomes recent moves by the Department\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations to begin implementing\r\nmeasures aimed at improving United Nations rapid-reaction\r\ncapability, but in taking these measures forward, the United\r\nNations should consult adequately with all Member States.\r\nAustralia is also keen to see the United Nations\r\ndevelop the preventive-diplomacy agenda and it welcomes\r\nthe greater resources the Secretariat now devotes to such\r\nactivity. The Security Council, the General Assembly and\r\nthe good offices of the Secretary-General, as well as\r\nregional arrangements and agencies, have important roles to\r\nplay in preventive diplomacy. Australia supports greater use\r\nof Chapter VI of the Charter on the pacific settlement of\r\ndisputes. Article 33 is particularly important. The Security\r\nCouncil can use it to undertake a leadership role by calling\r\non disputing parties to seek a solution using negotiation,\r\nmediation and other peaceful means.\r\nAs I indicated at the beginning of this statement, one\r\nof the chief results of the end of the cold war must surely\r\nbe an increase in our ability to turn away from military\r\nconcerns and to give a greater degree of attention to threats\r\nto the security of individuals, as distinct from those threats\r\nto the security of States that have dominated our thinking\r\nin the past, important and basic though they have been and\r\nremain.\r\nIn today’s world and in the world we see unfolding\r\ninto the twenty-first century, the security of far too many\r\npeople is threatened in ways no less immediate than the\r\nthreat of the gun. I have in mind narcotics, HIV/AIDS and\r\nmajor threats to the environment. These threats cannot be\r\ndealt with effectively by States acting alone. Sometimes\r\nthey require new international law, but more specifically\r\nthey require political will to defeat them and to foster\r\ncooperation among nations to ensure maximum\r\neffectiveness of action.\r\nThe United Nations is the ideal environment in which\r\nto develop such cooperation. It is here that the world is\r\nrepresented. We have here a tradition of debate, of\r\ndiscussion, of identification of problems and of consensus.\r\nWe have the ability to make law when it is necessary.\r\nAbove all, we have pledged ourselves to defending and\r\nproviding a decent standard of living to the peoples we\r\nrepresent.\r\nThere is also a regional role and, in that context,\r\nAustralia was pleased to have promoted the concept of a\r\nregional HIV/AIDS ministers’ meeting at the Post-\r\nMinisterial Conference of this year’s session of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations.\r\nAs we move towards the twenty-first century, it will\r\nbe crucial to the execution of that responsibility to ensure\r\nthat we have a healthy United Nations that is devoted to\r\ninternational cooperation aimed at defeating the major\r\nnon-military threats to the security of the human family.\r\nThese threats are tragically evident to us today. They will\r\nonly become larger if we do not agree, now, to begin\r\ncooperative action to defeat them. History will surely\r\njudge our generation harshly if, having identified the\r\nproblems of human security, we fail for lack of will to\r\naddress their solutions.\r\nAnother great requirement of our times is the\r\neconomic needs of people and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment. Much has been done through the United\r\nNations and its agencies to advance the development\r\ncause. They have been pivotal to the emergence of a\r\nmultilateral approach in which institutions with special\r\ncompetencies such as the specialized agencies, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank,\r\ntogether with policy deliberative bodies such as the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social Council,\r\nhave complementary roles to play.\r\nDevelopment is about more than just economic\r\ngrowth, however. There is also the need for internal\r\nstability, sound environmental management, a vigorous\r\ncivil society and a lively democracy. The United Nations\r\nis uniquely placed to build consensus on how to advance\r\nthese various elements of the development agenda.\r\nIn this context, Australia welcomes the constructive\r\noutcomes achieved at the ninth session of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) held in Midrand, South Africa, earlier this\r\nyear. The decisions taken there should help developing\r\ncountries benefit from the opportunities of economic\r\nglobalization.\r\nWe also underline the importance of encouraging\r\ninvestment and technology transfers and providing trade\r\nopportunities to stimulate economic development. Such\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\ndevelopment is the only enduring foundation for\r\nindependence and economic and social well-being.\r\nIt is in Africa that these development challenges are\r\nmost stark. Rich in promise yet wearied by emergencies,\r\nAfrica stands today at a decisive juncture in its history.\r\nAfrican leaders seized the moment with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity’s 1995 Cairo Agenda for\r\nAction, in which they called for immediate action to\r\nimplement the development strategies for which an\r\ninternational consensus now exists. The United Nations\r\nresponded this year with the launch of a 10-year,\r\n$25 billion United Nations System-wide Special Initiative\r\nfor Africa.\r\nThe Australian Government welcomes the Special\r\nInitiative as a concrete demonstration of the international\r\ncommunity’s concern with Africa. The international\r\ncommunity cannot allow disease, poverty, war and\r\nunderdevelopment to become entrenched in the 53\r\nnations — almost one-third of United Nations Member\r\nStates — that make up the African continent.\r\nThe world must continue to seek ways to break the\r\npoverty cycle in Africa so that its potential for economic\r\ndevelopment is realized. Sustainable economic development\r\nis essential to overcome poverty, disease and conflict.\r\nThe United Nations system needs to give greater focus\r\nand impetus to the development effort in Africa.\r\nI now turn to the issue of human rights. Human rights\r\nare important in international relations for two main\r\nreasons: first, political instability and major conflict can\r\nresult where human rights are breached or are under threat;\r\nand secondly, the freedom and dignity of individuals is, in\r\nitself, of fundamental value to the world community.\r\nThe Australian Government aims for practical\r\noutcomes that will improve the lives of individual men,\r\nwomen and children. We recognize the importance of\r\ndialogue and cooperation, based on mutual respect. In\r\naddition to public and private diplomacy, Australia’s\r\napproach to the improvement of human rights also\r\nencompasses development cooperation.\r\nAustralia strongly supports the development of strong\r\nand independent national human rights institutions. For\r\nexample, Australia provided financial support for a\r\nworkshop of Asia-Pacific national human rights institutions,\r\nwhich agreed to establish an informal forum to work for the\r\nstrengthening and further development of such institutions\r\nin the region. Australia has also provided financial\r\nsupport to the United Nations for the creation of a\r\nposition of special adviser to the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights on national human\r\nrights institutions.\r\nFinally, it is important to address the issue of reform\r\nof the United Nations. Much work still needs to be done\r\nto bring about greater efficiency and effectiveness in the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies.\r\nWhile Australia applauds the dedication and hard\r\nwork of the General Assembly Working Groups that were\r\nset up in 1995, Member States must not lose sight of the\r\nfact that to achieve real change, the Groups have to come\r\nup with realistic and achievable recommendations. Those\r\nrecommendations must in turn lead to practical and\r\nmeasurable outcomes.\r\nIt is important that the work of the groups be\r\nfocused and that their momentum be restored so that early\r\nand positive outcomes can be achieved. We must all\r\ncommit ourselves to this end and to bringing about\r\nstructured change within the United Nations.\r\nIt is also crucial that the financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations be repaired. Australia believes that all\r\nMembers should pay their contributions in full and on\r\ntime. We therefore welcome recent moves by some\r\ncountries to pay their arrears.\r\nIt is time to establish a revised scale of assessed\r\ncontributions that more fairly reflects what Governments\r\ncan pay. The current minimum payment is too high for\r\nmany small-economy countries, and Australia would like\r\nto see it reduced or even removed.\r\nThese are the reforms that Australia believes are\r\nnecessary to equip the United Nations for its role in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIt is in this overall context that Australia is deeply\r\ncommitted to contributing to the United Nations goal of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security in an active\r\nway. Serving a term as a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council during 1997-1998 would enable\r\nAustralia to make a substantive contribution to that goal\r\nand to work for a more effective, modernized and\r\ntransparent Council. That is why we have asked for the\r\nsupport of Member States at the elections to be held a\r\nfew weeks from now.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nLet me conclude by summing up what I have said\r\ntoday. The United Nations is unique and needed, but it\r\nmust pursue, and work on the basis of, a relevant Agenda.\r\nThis is the central point. The United Nations must be put\r\nto work on the agenda of the twenty-first century.\r\nMuch work needs to be done to tackle the key\r\nchallenges that face the United Nations. Only a sustained,\r\ncooperative effort among all Member States will bring\r\nsuccess. Australia will make that effort.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nTunisia, His Excellency Mr. Habib Ben Yahia.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me first of all to convey to Mr. Razali Ismail my\r\nsincere and heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of his\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that thanks to his wise\r\nand able leadership and his extensive experience in the field\r\nof international relations, the proceedings of our session\r\nwill be successful.\r\nMalaysia’s presidency of the General Assembly is\r\nclear testimony to the respect that Mr. Razali’s country\r\nenjoys within the international community, which\r\nappreciates the great and efficient role played by Malaysia\r\nat the regional and international levels in order to\r\nstrengthen and consolidate relations among nations on the\r\nbasis of peace, justice and cooperation. I take this\r\nopportunity to pay tribute to the excellent relations of\r\nfriendship and fruitful cooperation that exist between our\r\ntwo countries.\r\nI should like also to convey my sincere thanks to\r\nMr. Razali’s predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for his\r\nvaluable efforts during his presidency of the fiftieth session\r\nof the General Assembly. I wish to mention in particular\r\nhis contribution to helping advance the process of reform of\r\nthe United Nations, in order to make it more efficient in the\r\nlight of the changes the world is witnessing.\r\nI should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali and to convey to him our appreciation and\r\nsupport for his continued selfless dedication as head of the\r\nSecretariat of the United Nations. My delegation also\r\nappreciates his courageous initiatives, especially his Special\r\nInitiative for Africa, as well as his constructive proposals\r\nwithin the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. Tunisia, which supports the renewal of\r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali’s mandate, stresses the importance of\r\ncontinuing the reform process undertaken in recent years.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, the international\r\ncommunity has entered a new era of international\r\nrelations that aims to reject the use of force and violence\r\nas a means of settling conflicts, and to put an end to the\r\narms race. This trend favours the logic of wisdom and\r\nmoderation by resorting to peaceful means and preventive\r\ndiplomacy, which offer possibilities for dialogue,\r\nconcertation and negotiation to resolve conflicts, disputes\r\nand crises, however complex they may be.\r\nWe welcome this emerging trend in international\r\nrelations, which is a consecration of the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations as enunciated in its\r\nCharter. This trend must be strengthened and consolidated\r\nin order to eliminate sources of tension and defuse\r\nconflicts before they break out.\r\nThe international community welcomed with\r\nenthusiasm the start of the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast. This raised hopes of seeing the parties arrive at a\r\ntrue, comprehensive, just and honourable peace, thus\r\nputting an end to a cruel conflict that has lasted for\r\nalmost half a century, during which time the peoples of\r\nthe region have experienced the horrors of war,\r\ndestruction, exodus and occupation. This peace settlement\r\nshould be based on international law and United Nations\r\nresolutions, in particular Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and on the principle\r\nof the exchange of land for peace.\r\nThe Madrid Conference and the ensuing intensive\r\nnegotiations, which resulted in the Oslo, Washington and\r\nCairo agreements, led us to believe that the new peace\r\nprocess was finally on the right track. However, the\r\nagenda of the new Israeli Government has dashed the\r\nhopes of the peoples of the region. This agenda has\r\nindeed blocked the peace process on all tracks. An\r\nincrease in Israeli pressures and provocations, which aim\r\nultimately at imposing the policy of the fait accompli, has\r\nhindered the Palestinian people’s progress towards\r\nachieving their legitimate right to self-determination and\r\nto create their own independent State.\r\nThe bloody events triggered by the opening of a\r\ntunnel under the Holy Mosque of Al-Aqsa emphasize the\r\nneed for decisive international action to bring the Israeli\r\nGovernment to abide by the agreements concluded with\r\nthe Palestinian Authority and to comply with international\r\nlaw regarding the settlement of the question of Palestine.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nTunisia is concerned by the stagnation of the peace\r\nprocess and its negative effects on building the future of the\r\nregion on the basis of peace, security, stability and\r\ncooperation among its peoples. Tunisia considers that Israel\r\nmust re-evaluate its present policy and commit itself to\r\nrespecting the principles of the peace process and to\r\nimplementing the agreements already signed.\r\nWe also call upon the international community,\r\nparticularly the sponsors of the peace process, to spare no\r\neffort in facilitating the resumption of the peace\r\nnegotiations as soon as possible in order to avoid any risk\r\nof failure, which could affect the credibility of this process\r\nand lead to the return of confrontation and the escalation of\r\nviolence, extremism and terrorism. We believe that\r\nconfidence-building, good faith and a sincere commitment\r\nto a peaceful solution are necessary to advance this process.\r\nThe commitment of all parties to achieving a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace is essential to ensuring the\r\nsecurity and stability of the States of the region as well as\r\nthe coexistence of their peoples.\r\nAs stated by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on\r\nmany occasions, Tunisia is committed to following the\r\nsame approach it has taken since the beginning of the peace\r\nprocess, by establishing a close link between each step\r\ntowards normalization and the progress achieved by the\r\nnegotiations on all tracks.\r\nThe establishment of peace in the Middle East depends\r\non the maintenance of security and stability in the Gulf\r\nregion. Tunisia, which is deeply concerned by recent\r\ndevelopments in that region, calls upon all parties to show\r\nrestraint, avoid any escalation and remain committed to\r\ninternational legality and to the implementation of all\r\nUnited Nations resolutions. Tunisia also reiterates its\r\ncommitment to respect the sovereignty of all States in the\r\nregion as well as their territorial integrity and inviolability.\r\nWe also call for an end to the suffering that the Iraqi\r\npeople have been experiencing for several years, and we\r\nhope that recent developments in the region will not\r\naggravate this situation.\r\nTunisia believes that the time has come to lift the\r\nembargo imposed on the Libyan people in view of the\r\nnumerous positive initiatives taken by Libya, the League of\r\nArab States and the Organization of African Unity, all of\r\nwhich aim at reaching a peaceful and just solution and at\r\nputting an end to the suffering of the brotherly Libyan\r\npeople within the framework of international legality.\r\nDevoted to peace and a staunch supporter of just\r\ncauses, Tunisia reiterates its solidarity with the United\r\nArab Emirates and its full support for that country’s\r\nendeavour to recover through peaceful means, which\r\ninclude appealing to the International Court of Justice, the\r\nislands of Great Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.\r\nTurning to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nTunisia expresses its satisfaction at the return of peace to\r\nthis country, and hopes that the recent elections will mark\r\nthe beginning of a new era in which concord,\r\nunderstanding and common action will prevail, thus\r\nallowing the establishment of the foundations of the\r\nBosnian State.\r\nWe note that today the international community is\r\ngiving priority to disarmament as the best means of\r\nensuring and consolidating international security.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in this regard,\r\nespecially in the area of controlling the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, in particular chemical and\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nTunisia welcomes the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nand its opening for signature. We hope that all Member\r\nStates will adhere to this Treaty, in order to ensure its\r\nuniversal application. The Treaty’s conclusion, as well as\r\nthe anticipated strengthening of the Biological Weapons\r\nConvention, due to be reviewed soon in order to provide\r\nit with a verification mechanism, will no doubt\r\nconsolidate the progress made thus far in the field of\r\ndisarmament.\r\nWhile expressing our appreciation for the declaration\r\nof Africa as a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, we hope that\r\nour continent will be relieved of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We also reiterate our call to free the Middle\r\nEast from all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nWhile emphasizing the necessity of introducing\r\nefficient measures for ensuring a total ban of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, we believe that it is also essential to\r\ntackle the issue of conventional weapons, particularly the\r\nquestion of the accumulation and illegal trade in light\r\nweapons. This problem is not only serious but is growing\r\nmore so every day, since these are the most commonly\r\nused weapons in current conflicts and recent terrorist\r\noperations.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nIn addition to its contribution to disarmament efforts,\r\nTunisia has always supported United Nations peacekeeping\r\nefforts around the world. From the early 1960s on, it has\r\ntaken part in United Nations operations in many African\r\ncountries, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nConvinced of the importance of these operations in\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, Tunisia called\r\non member States of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) to create special units within their armed forces for\r\nparticipation when necessary in peacekeeping operations on\r\nthe African continent.\r\nWhile welcoming the decision of the United Nations\r\non establishing a system of standby forces to act to\r\nintervene rapidly and efficiently in peacekeeping operations,\r\nTunisia solemnly declares its readiness today to participate\r\nin that system, thus confirming our commitment to the\r\nOrganization and to its role in the maintenance of world\r\npeace and security.\r\nIntolerance, racism, organized crime, the illegal arms\r\nand drug trades, the illegal traffic in human beings,\r\nterrorism and extremism in all its forms are all phenomena\r\nthat have taken on a transnational dimension. The\r\ninternational community should ensure that appropriate\r\nsolutions are found by means of a global approach based on\r\nthe definition and implementation of international\r\ncooperation strategies in order to contain and eradicate\r\nthese scourges.\r\nOn many occasions and before various international\r\nand regional forums, my country has called the international\r\ncommunity’s attention to the dangers of re-emergent\r\nterrorism and extremism, which threaten the stability and\r\nsecurity of States as well as the safety of individuals. In\r\nthis vein, Tunisia called for the conduct of a comprehensive\r\nand thorough re-evaluation of the attitudes of all parties to\r\nthese scourges through the establishment of international\r\nrules of conduct with the aim of fighting all illegal\r\nactivities, particularly those related to terrorism, in order to\r\nfind efficient and lasting remedies to these problems and to\r\neliminate their deep-rooted causes.\r\nTunisia notes with satisfaction the increasing\r\nawareness of the need for the international community to\r\njoin efforts in order to fight terrorism. We hope that the\r\nUnited Nations will adopt mandatory measures that would\r\naddress this phenomenon by criminalizing all terrorist acts.\r\nWe also hope that all member States will revise and adapt\r\ntheir relevant legislation to these measures.\r\nTunisia’s steadfast efforts to consolidate the\r\nfoundations of the country’s political institutions and the\r\nrule of law and to promote and protect human rights in\r\ntheir global dimension flow from a civilized, irreversible\r\nchoice made in accordance with universal values.\r\nEager to ensure respect for human dignity and to\r\nencourage ongoing development efforts to secure the\r\nwell-being of all citizens, Tunisia has been able to\r\nreconcile, in a balanced manner, economic growth with\r\nthe preservation of political, economic and social rights,\r\nthe requisite foundations of democracy.\r\nTunisia will continue to advance the causes of\r\nhuman rights in the world and to support the United\r\nNations Voluntary Fund for technical assistance in the\r\nfield of human rights, as well as the Programme of\r\nAction for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights\r\nEducation.\r\nWe are persuaded that the dissemination of the\r\nculture of human rights will come to fruition only with\r\nthe promotion of tolerance, which is an essential civilized\r\nvalue upon which are based all religions and human-rights\r\nideals.\r\nTunisia placed particular emphasis on tolerance in\r\nthe reform of its education system, since it is convinced\r\nthat global change, the progress of civilization and\r\nculture, as well as economic and social growth, will be\r\nfirmly established only when coming generations are\r\nwell-prepared and when the values of peace, democracy\r\nand goodness are complemented by a culture of tolerance.\r\nEconomic globalization has opened new perspectives\r\nfor international cooperation for development. But it has\r\nalso had a negative impact on the economies of numerous\r\ndeveloping countries that have been swept up in it\r\nwithout adequately preparing their economic and social\r\nstructures.\r\nIn the new era, Tunisia has focused on setting up a\r\ncomprehensive and multidimensional development\r\nstrategy designed to assist the disadvantaged in society\r\nand based on a broadened concept of human rights.\r\nTunisia’s policy in this regard was based on a\r\ndevelopment approach aimed at providing equal\r\nopportunities to all levels of society and ensuring the\r\nwell-being of all its citizens.\r\nThe human dimension for which Tunisia has opted\r\nin defining its development policies has led to a deeper\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nspirit of solidarity within the population towards the\r\nunderprivileged and vulnerable sectors and to granting them\r\nthe highest priority. In order to achieve these objectives,\r\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali took the initiative of\r\nestablishing an anti-poverty programme — the National\r\nSolidarity Fund — aimed at eradicating pockets of poverty\r\nand ensuring harmonious development for all social sectors.\r\nThe debt burden in the third world is a very serious\r\nproblem that cannot be overlooked, since it constitutes the\r\nmain obstacle to their efforts to achieve a regular\r\ndevelopment pattern, free from any shortcomings or failure.\r\nWhile we welcome the Group of Seven’s economic\r\ncommuniqué on the issue of debt, we also stress the need\r\nto take appropriate measures to alleviate the debt burden of\r\nmiddle-income countries.\r\nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\r\nand the World Trade Organization should implement the\r\ncommitments undertaken by the international community in\r\nthe framework of the major conferences held during the\r\npast five years. To this end, they need to mobilize the\r\nresources required to fund the programmes adopted by\r\nthese conferences in the quest for sustainable development.\r\nWe welcome the process of reform initiated by the\r\nUnited Nations with the aim of adjusting to the emerging\r\ninternational environment, improving its functions and\r\nassuming its responsibilities as the institution best able to\r\nmaintain peace and security, on the one hand, and to pursue\r\nand support efforts on behalf of the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the developing countries, on the other.\r\nTo this end, it is equally important to continue the\r\nprocess of reform of the Organization with the aim of\r\nrationalizing and strengthening its role as the central pillar\r\nof international cooperation for achieving objectives and\r\nimplementing programmes agreed upon by the international\r\ncommunity, on the basis of priorities set by Governments\r\nseeking to eradicate poverty and to support employment and\r\nhousing programmes, as well as those that provide basic\r\nservices in the education and health sectors and offer\r\nprotection to women, children and the socially\r\nunderprivileged.\r\nThese objectives can be attained only through the use\r\nof jointly agreed criteria based on transparency and\r\ndemocracy in international relations, and by rejecting any\r\npolicy that involves a double standard.\r\nIn order to preserve the prestige and credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations, it is necessary to implement the resolutions\r\nthe Organization adopts and to follow up on the\r\ncommitments entered into by States.\r\nWe would also like to underline the extreme\r\nimportance we attach to the restructuring of the Security\r\nCouncil, so as to enable this eminent body to play its key\r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, while taking into consideration the need for an\r\nequitable geographical representation based on new geo-\r\npolitical realities. I should like to recall in this respect that\r\nTunisia supports granting Japan and Germany the status\r\nof permanent members of the Security Council, owing to\r\nthe political and economic standing of both countries.\r\nIn accordance with the consensus reached at the\r\nthirtieth Organization of African Unity summit meeting,\r\nheld in Tunis, we reaffirm Africa’s right to at least two\r\npermanent seats on the Security Council that would rotate\r\namong all African States.\r\nTunisia supports any initiative that takes into account\r\nthese principles, and it expresses its appreciation for the\r\ninitiatives and ideas presented by some States, in\r\nparticular friendly neighbouring Italy, in order to achieve\r\na comprehensive vision regarding reform of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nFinally, we believe that the success of our\r\nOrganization depends on the determination of all Member\r\nStates to act in conformity with the purposes and\r\nprinciples set out in the Charter, as well as on sincere\r\npolitical will, in order to allow our Organization to fulfil\r\nthe aspirations and hopes of our peoples, who provide it\r\nthe indispensable support it needs to guarantee its\r\ncontinued vitality, its renewed capacity and its durability.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nHonduras, His Excellency Mr. Delmer Urbizo Panting.\r\nMr. Urbizo (Honduras) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Once again the United Nations General\r\nAssembly is meeting to take stock of the global situation\r\nand of the role that the Organization plays in that context.\r\nI am confident that the experience, talent and diplomatic\r\nskills of our President, His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail,\r\nwill play a decisive role in this complex undertaking. I\r\nwish him every success in his sensitive work.\r\nI wish also to express my delegation’s gratitude for\r\nthe excellent job done by Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, in the course of\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nthe last General Assembly session, which commemorated\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this Organization.\r\nMy country has been observing very closely the\r\nadministrative activities of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his\r\ncapacity as Secretary-General, and we feel bound to express\r\nour recognition of the poise with which he has guided the\r\nUnited Nations during these difficult times for the\r\nOrganization and for the whole world. His undeniable\r\nqualities of statesmanship have averted crises, and his\r\nstrength of character has succeeded in upholding the ideals\r\non which this Organization is founded. I wish to convey to\r\nhim, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Government,\r\nmy sincere respect and admiration.\r\nHonduras reiterates its conviction that international\r\nconflicts must be settled by peaceful and diplomatic means.\r\nFor this reason, we recognize the importance and value of\r\nthe 1995 Dayton peace agreement, the 1996 Paris\r\nagreements and the subsequent international agreements and\r\ncommitments for which the international community\r\nprepared the way. These have led to a cessation of\r\nhostilities, the resumption of political talks, international\r\nrecognition between Belgrade and Zagreb, and the\r\nestablishment of relations between the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia and The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia.\r\nIn the Americas, Haiti is an example of the results that\r\ncan be achieved through concerted action and political will\r\non the part of the international community in establishing,\r\nthrough the United Nations, operations designed to achieve,\r\nmaintain and consolidate peace. My country wishes to\r\nexpress its satisfaction at having taken part in those\r\noperations, as well as in those carried out in Western\r\nSahara.\r\nIn the same vein, we cannot overlook the problems of\r\nthe subregion. Honduras has always viewed with concern\r\nthe problems besetting its sister republics in Central\r\nAmerica. For this reason, we acknowledge and support all\r\nefforts in this regard, in particular the agreements reached\r\nbetween the Government of Guatemala and the URNG.\r\nAt the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly,\r\nmy country secured unanimous support in this body to\r\noccupy a seat in the Security Council as a non-permanent\r\nmember. We believe that we have fully lived up to the trust\r\nvested in us, since we have worked in the Council in strict\r\nadherence to the principles and norms of international law\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and in keeping\r\nwith the foreign policy pursued by the President of the\r\nRepublic, Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina.\r\nThroughout our first term of presidency of the\r\nCouncil, in July last year, we succeeded in maintaining\r\nthe necessary equanimity and balance to steer the work\r\nand the debates on the various issues brought before the\r\npresidency of the Council. These included humanitarian\r\noperations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda and\r\nBurundi, as well as peace operations in Haiti, Angola and\r\nLiberia.\r\nTomorrow we will assume the presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council for the second time, and we shall work\r\nin the same spirit of cooperation and with genuine resolve\r\nto help bring about solutions to problems that arise in the\r\narea of international peace and security.\r\nCentral America has now returned to the world\r\nscene with a new, integrational approach that promotes\r\njoint action and allows it to speed up its development\r\nprocess. Our approach, grounded in history, tradition,\r\nsolidarity and, above all, our awareness of a shared\r\ndestiny, has made it possible for us to pool our efforts in\r\nseeking to achieve a higher level of economic\r\ndevelopment in all areas.\r\nIn the framework of the integration process in our\r\nsubregion, since 1986 we have held a series of\r\npresidential summits, the first six of which were highly\r\npolitical in nature, fulfilling the purpose of securing peace\r\nand democratization in the region. The following ones,\r\nfocusing on economic topics, led to the formation of the\r\nCentral American Integration System (SICA) and defined\r\nour current agenda: alliance for sustainable development.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank this\r\nAssembly for the support it gave our System last year by\r\ngranting it the status of observer, which will make it\r\npossible to achieve greater cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations System and the Central American\r\nIntegration System.\r\nAs we stand on the threshold of a new millennium,\r\nmy Government is strongly committed to the\r\nresponsibilities imposed by the world around us. In this\r\nrespect, Honduras is in favour of greater democratization\r\nof the principal organs of the United Nations. We take the\r\nview that an increase in the number of permanent and\r\nnon-permanent Members of the Security Council should\r\nbe carried out in accordance with the principles of\r\nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\ndistribution, and that it should reflect the expansion in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations in recent decades so as\r\nto transform the Security Council into a more democratic\r\nand representative organ, that would thus be a more\r\ncredible and effective instrument in fulfilling its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity without affecting its efficiency or the speed of its\r\ndecision-making processes. Genuine democratization and\r\nreal representativity in the Security Council should be the\r\nprincipal basis for the expansion of twenty-first-century\r\nworld government.\r\nWe would all like to see a more competent, responsive\r\nand responsible United Nations. We should all like it to be\r\nbetter administered and more consolidated and to yield\r\ntangible results. To this end, it is essential to undertake\r\nmeaningful reform in order to enhance its efficiency and to\r\nensure that the United Nations can have a secure financial\r\nfooting, robust administration and structural capacity, and\r\na clear sense of purpose in tackling its tasks.\r\nThe General Assembly should play the role now\r\nplayed by costly world conferences, and it should be the\r\nforum for sustained thematic debates on important and\r\ntopical issues held at regular intervals. At the same time,\r\nthe traditional agenda of the Assembly should be cut back\r\nradically. Recurring items should be considered less\r\nfrequently. We should impose a time limit on our\r\nstatements, and we need to reform the structure of the\r\ncommittees and auxiliary bodies so as to avoid overlapping\r\nand duplication.\r\nMy country, Honduras, is continuing to work\r\nvigorously to strengthen, among other things, its democratic\r\nsystem of government, to bolster judicial power, to organize\r\nthe national police under civilian rule, to modernize the\r\nState, in addition to striving to create a new frame of\r\nreference to promote development on the basis of full\r\nparticipation by all sectors of society.\r\nHonduras, like all other developing countries, is deeply\r\ncommitted to processes designed to combat poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of its\r\npeoples and resources in order to attain speedy, fair and\r\nsustained growth, working jointly to enhance the effect of\r\nnational efforts through solidarity, cooperation and mutual\r\nconfidence.\r\nHowever, there are still many economic and financial\r\nobligations that need to be met in the short- and medium-\r\nterm. International cooperation is steadily declining, and\r\npoverty indicators are becoming worse.\r\nWe wish to see a world where countries, mindful of\r\ntheir diversity, act together to attain common goals, a\r\nworld in which peace, security and dignity will be the\r\ncommon heritage of all peoples, a world in which the\r\nadvances of science will serve to benefit humankind and,\r\nin short, a world in which existing resources are used\r\nrationally in order to meet everyone’s needs. This is our\r\nunderstanding of what, in essence, North-South\r\ncooperation should mean.\r\nAs the United Nations enters its second half-century,\r\nwe have an opportunity to work towards the objective of\r\nits Charter — world cooperation in deterring and halting\r\naggression — and to foster peaceful, productive and\r\nsustainable human progress. In this respect, “An Agenda\r\nfor Development” offers a unique opportunity to make the\r\nissue of economic and social development a central\r\npriority of the multilateral system. Promotion of sustained\r\neconomic growth and eradication of poverty in the\r\ndeveloping countries, as well as the legitimate leadership\r\nthat the United Nations should show in this field, must\r\nalso be key objectives of the Agenda.\r\nMy country hopes that the negotiations on the\r\nAgenda for Development being held by the Ad Hoc\r\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on\r\nAn Agenda for Development will conclude promptly and\r\nsuccessfully in the course of the fifty-first session of the\r\nAssembly. The completion of this work will be a point of\r\ndeparture because it will give rise to firm commitments\r\nand mark the beginning of the task of putting the actions\r\nagreed upon into practice.\r\nHonduras, as a peace-loving country, reaffirms its\r\ntotal support for the principles and objectives seeking the\r\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons and to establish\r\na universal, verifiable, multilateral and effective\r\nmachinery that will help to promote nuclear disarmament\r\nand to prevent proliferation of such weapons in all its\r\naspects.\r\nConsistent with these principles, I am pleased to\r\nannounce that Honduras has signed the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at this session of the General\r\nAssembly, and I would venture to appeal to all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to sign it as soon as\r\npossible. We would also urge all States possessing\r\nnuclear weapons to take resolute steps to reduce them\r\nwith a view to their elimination.\r\nThe existence of landmines and other undetonated\r\nexplosive devices in various regions of the world is a\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\ntremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to the\r\nsecurity, health and survival of the local population where\r\nthese deadly devices have been scattered. These devices\r\nprevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to their\r\nhomes in the States affected by this ongoing menace and\r\nimpede humanitarian operations and programmes, national\r\nreconstruction and economic development activities and\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nFor this reason, we urge Member States, particularly\r\nthose that have the capacity to do so, to lend their\r\nassistance to the affected countries, including those of the\r\nCentral American region, with a view to establishing and\r\nrefining national mine-clearance mechanisms. We also\r\nappeal to the international community finally to agree on\r\nthe total prohibition of the production, exportation, sale and\r\nuse of anti-personnel mines.\r\nMy delegation wishes once again to place on record its\r\ninterest in seeing the Republic of China in Taiwan admitted\r\nas a Member of the United Nations. At this moment in\r\ntime, when democratic systems of government and the rule\r\nof law are gaining ground in most of the nations that make\r\nup this Organization, it seems contradictory to continue\r\nexcluding the Republic of China in Taiwan from\r\nparticipation. This is a country which struggled\r\ndeterminedly for democracy and succeeded in establishing\r\nit this year with the election of a Government by the direct\r\nvote of the majority of its people. This is a nation that\r\nrespects human rights, possesses one of the strongest\r\neconomies on earth and has been constantly struggling to\r\neradicate poverty, and whose population of 21 million\r\npeople enjoys an enviable cultural level. In short, the\r\nRepublic of China in Taiwan fully meets the requirements\r\nestablished in the Charter for membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nFor the developing countries, its participation in the\r\nvarious international forums would be extremely beneficial,\r\nsince we would be able to draw on its valuable experience\r\nin cooperation programmes, as demonstrated when it\r\noccupied a seat in this General Assembly from the day it\r\nsigned the Charter until 1971.\r\nIn this respect, my Government supports the resolution\r\nadopted on 19 July 1996 by the European Parliament\r\nentitled the “Role of Taiwan in International\r\nOrganizations”, which explicitly states its support for the\r\nidea that the Republic of China in Taiwan should have a\r\ngreater level of recognition and representation in\r\ninternational agencies. It also urges the United Nations to\r\nestablish a working group to study the possibility of its\r\nparticipation in the activities of the United Nations and its\r\ninternational agencies.\r\nThe problem of drug production is not as severe in\r\nthe Central American region as it is elsewhere, although\r\nour countries are not unaffected by drug use. For this\r\nreason, on 21 June, the Ministers of the Interior of our\r\nregion agreed to develop a plan of cooperation to fight\r\nthis evil. In this regard, we support the initiative of\r\nconvening a special session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly in 1998 in order to strengthen the international\r\nstrategy to combat narcotic drugs.\r\nWith a view to beginning to address the problem of\r\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations\r\nsystem, 1996 could be a year of meditation and reflection.\r\nCalls have been made for a redefinition of the purposes\r\nof the Organization and, in particular, of the tasks of the\r\nSecurity Council. In order to achieve this important task,\r\nwe must work on the basis of a shared and balanced\r\nvision of the future of the Organization. The construction\r\nof a culture of international peace, security and prosperity\r\nshould be the ultimate goal in this redefinition of tasks.\r\nThis is something that the United Nations must\r\naccomplish in response to the needs of our peoples.\r\nAs we approach the end of the century and the\r\nmillennium, the globality of economies and the grouping\r\nof countries into systems of integration are becoming\r\nirreversible facts. One consequence of this will be the\r\nresurgence of mega-States in which smaller States will\r\nremain submerged. We are concerned for the future of\r\nweaker and less developed nations which, like ours,\r\nrequire great external and internal efforts to retain the\r\nidentity that distinguishes them from the rest of the world.\r\nThe right of peoples to decide their own destiny on\r\nthe basis of sovereignty is enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. This right must be observed in the new\r\nworld order if we wish to preserve, as is our duty, peace\r\nand cultural plurality among nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nAmbassador, Permanent Representative and Head of\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Rwanda, His Excellency,\r\nMr. Gideon Kayinamura.\r\nMr. Kayinamura (Rwanda): Permit me to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his unanimous election\r\nto preside over this session. His election is a reaffirmation\r\nby the United Nations Member States of the confidence\r\nthat they have placed in him and in the Government of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nMalaysia. In this regard, I should like to assure him of the\r\ncooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Rwanda in\r\nour shared desire to galvanize the community of nations in\r\ntheir common resolve to fulfil the objectives of the United\r\nNations Charter. I should like to take this opportunity to\r\npay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral, for presiding over the fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly in a most efficient and able manner.\r\nThe session over which Mr. Razali is presiding will be\r\naddressing a considerable agenda of more than 155 items,\r\nwhich, when put together, will contribute to world peace,\r\nsecurity and stability. The United Nations is the most\r\nappropriate forum to discuss these and other related matters\r\nof global peace, development and international cooperation.\r\nThe agenda before us therefore seeks to address the\r\nimplementation of the objectives of the Charter, as\r\nenshrined in Article 1.\r\nAs we move towards the twenty-first century, it is our\r\nindividual and collective responsibility to re-examine the\r\nextent to which our countries have or have not contributed\r\nto the attainment of these objectives. The United Nations\r\nAgenda for Peace and its valuable initiatives on\r\npeacekeeping, human rights and other development-related\r\nissues — collective security, terrorism, denuclearization,\r\nconflict prevention and resolution — will be discussed\r\nduring the session. Rwanda would like to join its voice to\r\nthose of the delegations that spoke from this rostrum and\r\nwho called for world peace, security and the development\r\nof developing countries.\r\nStatements have been made from this rostrum in\r\nconnection with what some have described as the ghastly\r\nevents that took place in Rwanda in 1994. Many, perhaps\r\ninadvertently and in a simplistic manner, have described the\r\nevents of 1994 in Rwanda as a conflict, a crisis, ghastly\r\nevents or as gross violations of human rights. There was\r\ngenocide in Rwanda, nothing else but a genocide. It was\r\nnot a tribal or ethnic conflict, as it is often referred to.\r\nBetween April and July 1994 more than one million\r\nRwandans were butchered in a systematic and planned\r\nmanner. This carnage was carried out in only 98 days. The\r\ndevastating effects of the aftermath of the Rwandan\r\ngenocide are still with us, and we live with them. Rwanda’s\r\npopulation now consists of 70 per cent women, 60 per cent\r\nof whom are widows, and we have 400,000 orphans in the\r\ncountry.\r\nThe perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide are still at\r\nlarge in some capitals. Far from feeling remorse, they pride\r\nthemselves in their unfinished agenda. Their army, militia\r\nand political leadership are in military and refugee camps\r\nwithin walking distance of the Rwanda-Zaire border. They\r\nhave recently stepped up infiltrations into Rwanda in\r\norder to kill the remaining survivors of genocide.\r\nWe call upon the international community to exert\r\npressure on the Government of Zaire to relocate the\r\nrefugees away from its borders with Rwanda, in\r\nconformity with the 1951 Geneva convention (relating to\r\nthe Status of Refugees).\r\nThe withdrawal of United Nations peacekeeping\r\ntroops in April 1994, at the height of the execution of the\r\ngenocidal agenda, was not helpful. For us in Rwanda, it\r\nremains, and will continue to remain, a reminder of the\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations to ensure that this\r\ndoes not reoccur anywhere else. More importantly, it\r\npoints to the need for the United Nations to support\r\nRwanda in its efforts to rebuild its socio-economic\r\ninfrastructure. This is critical. There can be no sustainable\r\npeace without reconstruction and development. The recent\r\nhigh-level symposium on conflicts in Africa, which was\r\nheld in Tokyo this month, on 9 and 10 September, came\r\nto the same conclusion.\r\nAllow me to put on record my Government’s\r\nappreciation of the efforts made by those countries,\r\ninstitutions and humanitarian agencies that helped and\r\ncontinue to assist Rwanda in the various sectoral\r\nrehabilitation programmes. We are equally grateful to\r\nthose who have shown their disposition to do so in the\r\nnear future.\r\nThe recently concluded round table conference,\r\nwhich was organized with the support of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), has been\r\nhelpful. We are grateful for the commitments that were\r\nmade. This will go a long way in assisting Rwanda to\r\nconsolidate and build on the achievements of the past two\r\nyears.\r\nThe Government of National Unity of Rwanda,\r\nunder the leadership of His Excellency President Pasteur\r\nBizimungu, has made significant strides to return the\r\ncountry to normalcy. Tremendous achievements have\r\nbeen made, including the gradual and steady rehabilitation\r\nof the security structure, the judiciary, the legislature and\r\nthe economy. The sound macroeconomic policies that\r\nhave been adopted have contributed, in less than two\r\nyears, to a reduction in inflation from 60 per cent in 1994\r\nto 10 per cent in 1996. This will drop to 5 per cent by the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nend of 1997. Agricultural production has reached 70 per\r\ncent of the pre-war level, and we have recorded impressive\r\nlevels of food production.\r\nWe are also pleased to inform the international\r\ncommunity that more than 2.2 million refugees have now\r\nreturned to Rwanda. All Rwandan refugees originally based\r\nin Burundi have been repatriated and successfully resettled\r\nin their own communities without incident. This is\r\nsufficient proof that Rwandan refugees in other\r\nneighbouring countries, apart from being the hostages of\r\ngenocidal leaders in the refugee camps, have no other\r\nreasons to remain.\r\nThese achievements have been made in spite of some\r\ncritical factors that the international community could help\r\nRwanda overcome if we are to maintain the pace of our\r\ncontinuing progress towards stability, durable peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe crippling debt burden has hamstrung all social\r\nsectors, especially the most vulnerable groups. Children,\r\nwomen, widows and the elderly are among the most\r\naffected. Rwanda’s debt stock at the end of 1995 stood at\r\na staggering high of $1 billion, or 91 per cent of the gross\r\ndomestic product (GDP). Most of this, 84 per cent, is owed\r\nto multilateral institutions; 13 per cent is bilateral; and the\r\nremaining 3 per cent is on account of suppliers’ credits.\r\nGiven the magnitude of this suffocating debt, the\r\nGovernment cannot rebuild its shattered socio-economic\r\ninfrastructure in the aftermath of genocide. We therefore\r\nurge the international community, and especially the\r\nmultilateral financial and development institutions, to cancel\r\nimmediately Rwanda’s debt. Short of new resources in the\r\nform of a Marshall Plan, this cancellation would greatly\r\ncontribute to Rwanda’s recovery and sustainable growth.\r\nWe know very well that where there has been a significant\r\ninfusion of financial resources in post-war periods, peace\r\nand stability have been achieved and sustained.\r\nThe question of conflicts and insecurity in the Great\r\nLakes region has been mentioned by many speakers. The\r\nsituation in Burundi is cause for concern to many,\r\nespecially the countries of the region. I should like in this\r\nregard to commend the efforts of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, the leaders of the region and all those who\r\nare involved in the search for a durable solution.\r\nRegional instability has been complicated by the\r\nsystematic persecution of Kinyarwanda-speaking Zaireans.\r\nThis process was stepped up this year with the massacre of\r\nseveral North Kivu region Zaireans of Rwandese culture;\r\nothers were forced to flee to Rwanda and Uganda. This\r\npersecution has recently been extended to the South Kivu\r\nregion of Zaire, where, again, Kinyarwanda-speaking\r\nZaireans have been subjected to brutal attacks by Zairean\r\nforces, along with former Rwanda Government soldiers\r\nand interahamwe militias, who did not finish but exported\r\ntheir genocidal and “ethnic cleansing” agenda.\r\nSurvivors of these attacks — predominantly women\r\nand children, as men and boys are either killed or\r\nimprisoned — have been forced to seek refuge in\r\nRwanda. It is the responsibility of the Government of\r\nZaire to unconditionally repatriate its nationals who are\r\ncurrently living in refugee camps in Rwanda. We call\r\nupon the international community to prevail upon the\r\nGovernment of Zaire so as to stop the systematic “ethnic\r\ncleansing” currently taking place in eastern Zaire. We\r\nfurther call upon the Government of Zaire to cease\r\nimmediately its military aggression which has recently\r\nbeen directed against Rwandan territory.\r\nWe would like to pay tribute to Mwalimu Julius\r\nNyerere, former President of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania, for his unequivocal and genuine search for\r\nsolutions, not only for Burundi, but also within the wider\r\ncontext of the Great Lakes region.\r\nThe problem is not the lack of solutions. What is\r\nlacking is the decisiveness to implement commitments\r\nvoluntarily entered into. That is what should be addressed.\r\nIn the case of the Great Lakes region, former Presidents\r\nJulius Nyerere of Tanzania, Jimmy Carter of the United\r\nStates of America and General Touré of Mali successfully\r\nmanaged to get the Heads of State and Government to\r\nagree and sign solemn declarations on the modalities for\r\nsolving the problems of the region.\r\nAt this session, we will be considering the\r\nre-election of the Secretary-General. My Government’s\r\nposition has been clear since Yaoundé, during the summit\r\nof the Organization of African Unity. We are not\r\nsupportive of the re-election of the incumbent. Doing so\r\nwould reward his failure to use the instruments of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter in order to come to the rescue of\r\nRwandans during the genocide. Above all, it would be\r\nagainst the collective conscience of the Rwandan people\r\nto support the candidacy of the incumbent. But beyond\r\nthese moral grounds, we believe that the election of a\r\ncontested Secretary-General is not in the interest of the\r\nUnited Nations. It would jeopardize the functioning of an\r\ninstitution that needs to be strengthened.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Ambassador,\r\nPermanent Representative and Chairman of the delegation\r\nof the Republic of Estonia, Mr. Trivimi Velliste.\r\nMr. Velliste (Estonia): Let me begin by congratulating\r\nMr. Razali Ismail on his assumption of the office of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nI am confident that his valuable guidance will lead to the\r\nsuccessful outcome of this session. He has the assurance of\r\nour full support.\r\nAs an introduction, let me recall that this September\r\nmarks the fifth anniversary of Estonia’s return to the\r\ninternational scene. It was five years ago that the Estonian\r\nblue, black and white tricolour was hoisted in front of this\r\nforum. That moment was equal in historic and emotional\r\nsignificance to the one 70 years earlier, in September 1921\r\nin Geneva, when Estonia was welcomed as a new member\r\nof the League of Nations — an international organization\r\nwhose history has taught the world many lessons.\r\nThe cold war is over. Nevertheless, the international\r\ncommunity continues to seek further guarantees of a more\r\nsecure future for our children and grandchildren. In this\r\nrespect, Estonia would like to express satisfaction at the\r\nrecent overwhelming support for the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the General Assembly.\r\nThe signing ceremony at the United Nations on 24\r\nSeptember was an important milestone, a result of\r\ncontinued negotiations and at the same time a sign of hope\r\nfor the future. We firmly believe that the Treaty can make\r\nan important contribution to preventing the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and promoting international security. The\r\nUnited Nations must now give a clear response to people\r\nwho want to live in a world free of any threats of nuclear\r\nweapons and other means of mass destruction.\r\nOur world is facing new challenges. These new\r\nchallenges require a renewed United Nations. At the last\r\nsession, considerable efforts were made to reform the\r\nOrganization. This work will continue during the current\r\nsession. In fact, one of the principal goals of the session\r\nahead of us will be to increase the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations. Estonia welcomes the progress made in this\r\narea. There are still a number of ways by which the United\r\nNations can further improve its performance. We attach\r\nparticular importance to the review of the working methods\r\nof the functional commissions and expert groups and bodies\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, as well as to better\r\ncoordination between the work of the Second and Third\r\nCommittees.\r\nEstonia is looking forward to active participation in\r\nUnited Nations-reform working groups. We attach\r\nspecific importance to the financial reform of the\r\nOrganization. Estonia is supportive of the view that the\r\nUnited Nations should be put on a sounder financial\r\nfooting. Member States should make every effort to fulfil\r\ntheir obligation to pay their arrears without any\r\nconditions. At the same time, we share the understanding\r\nthat the United Nations scale of assessments should be\r\nrevised. The new scale of assessments must be fair and\r\nmore transparent. It should also better reflect the\r\nfundamental principle of capacity to pay. We hope that\r\nthe High-level Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nFinancial Situation of the United Nations will achieve a\r\ncomprehensive and consensus solution to the current\r\nfinancial difficulties of the Organization.\r\nThe reform of the Organization will also include\r\nchanges in the composition and working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council. We welcome the decision by the\r\nGeneral Assembly mandating the relevant Open-ended\r\nWorking Group to submit a report to the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. At the same time, we\r\nhope that, along the lines of the mandate of the Working\r\nGroup, Member States can bring about a resolution to the\r\nlong-standing discussions on Security Council\r\nenlargement.\r\nPeacekeeping continues to be one of the important\r\nactivities of the Organization. Recent years have seen a\r\nchanging role for United Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nToday they have grown into manifold and diversified\r\ntypes of action. A new challenge for United Nations\r\npeacekeepers is dealing with internal conflicts throughout\r\nthe world. In this respect, I would like to reiterate that\r\nregional peacekeeping efforts that are conducted under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations must remain under\r\nstringent United Nations control.\r\nEstonia is continuing to take part in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping. This autumn we will increase our\r\ncontribution to the United Nations peacekeeping forces by\r\noffering a company to the United Nations Interim Force\r\nin Lebanon (UNIFIL). The company will be deployed in\r\nthe Norwegian battalion. The deployment is part of a joint\r\nproject to develop a Baltic peacekeeping battalion. That\r\nbattalion will be the contribution of the Baltic States to\r\nthe strengthening of United Nations peacekeeping\r\ncapacities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nall of the Governments that have contributed to this\r\ncommon Baltic project.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 September 1996\r\nDuring the past year Estonia has taken further steps\r\ntowards the implementation and follow-up of the major\r\nUnited Nations Conferences — Rio, Vienna, Cairo,\r\nCopenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul. To this end, a special\r\ninter-ministerial commission has been established in\r\nEstonia. Since the critical areas of concern of many of the\r\nconferences overlap, we are also looking forward to a better\r\ncoordination of their outcomes.\r\nLast year important work was done by the Preparatory\r\nCommittee on the Establishment of an International\r\nCriminal Court in elaborating the text of a statute for such\r\na court. We welcome that work and look forward to further\r\nprogress during the fifty-first session.\r\nFailure to respect human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms is a major cause of conflict. Many intra-State\r\nconflicts arise from the denial of basic human rights. The\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights made it clear\r\nthat the promotion and protection of all human rights is a\r\nduty for all States. Estonia reaffirms its continued\r\ncommitment to human rights. In spite of the hardships of\r\ninstitutional and economic transition, we have been able to\r\nmake democracy a way of life. Human rights for all\r\nresidents of Estonia is an inextricable part of Estonian\r\ndemocracy.\r\nWe continue to place particular importance upon the\r\nwork of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr.\r\nJosé Ayala Lasso, the Centre for Human Rights and United\r\nNations human rights machinery in general. A transparent\r\nfunctioning of this machinery should rely on impartial\r\nreporting and disregard politically motivated allegations.\r\nFailure to do so would seriously damage the credibility of\r\nthe Organization. Owing to very recent memories, this\r\nissue is of special importance to Estonia. This is also one\r\nof the reasons why Estonia lists among its priorities issues\r\nregarding indigenous peoples and human rights.\r\nEstonia believes that it is essential to secure\r\nadequate financing for the office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights. At the same time, we would like to point\r\nout that various regional organizations that focus on\r\nhuman rights issue periodic reports regarding such\r\nmatters. In order to avoid duplication and to make\r\neffective use of resources, the United Nations human\r\nrights machinery should rely on the extensive expertise of\r\nregional organizations, including the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\r\nCouncil of Europe. Those two organizations foster the\r\nbasic foundations of security and stability in Europe. The\r\nUnited Nations should further enhance its ties with them,\r\nespecially with the Council of Europe, the established\r\nstronghold of human rights on the European continent and\r\na symbol of cooperation between nations striving for an\r\nopen and mutually beneficial dialogue. Estonia, the\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Council of Europe, is pursuing\r\npolicies of positive engagement in relations with all\r\ncountries, including our eastern neighbour. In this respect,\r\nit is our sincere hope that the Russian Federation will\r\nreciprocate our efforts.\r\nIn conclusion, let me underline our commitment to\r\ncontribute, together with all Member States, to the\r\nestablishment of a world community in which individuals\r\nand States may live in peace and understanding. Let me\r\nexpress our sincere hope for a better world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI would like to note that, thanks to the praiseworthy\r\npunctuality of delegations, we have saved time, even\r\nthough the list of speakers for this meeting was longer\r\nthan usual: we have heard seven speakers instead of six.\r\nThus, we can see that punctuality and the brevity of\r\nstatements really do pay off.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
