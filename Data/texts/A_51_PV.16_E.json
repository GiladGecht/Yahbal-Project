(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call first on the Minister of State and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Romania, His Excellency\r\nMr. Teodor Viorel Melescanu.\r\nMr. Melescanu (Romania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the particular pleasure of congratulating\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly and of expressing our\r\nsatisfaction at seeing in such a high position the\r\nrepresentative of a country and a region so widely\r\nappreciated for their traditions and dynamism. I am\r\nconvinced that your experience and your qualities as an\r\neminent diplomat will facilitate the proceedings and the\r\nsuccessful outcome of this session. I would like also to\r\nexpress our thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral of Portugal, for the able manner in which he\r\ndirected the previous session of the General Assembly.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express our high\r\nappreciation for the remarkable activity carried out with\r\nsuch dedication since 1992 by the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to the benefit of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Assembly has gathered again not only to review\r\nrecent regional and world developments or to survey last\r\nyear’s results, but also to discuss especially the prospects\r\nand challenges we are facing at the threshold of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nWe are essentially called upon to reflect and act\r\njointly on establishing an international system that can\r\nguarantee security, stability, progress and prosperity for\r\nall. The United Nations is certainly the pillar of such a\r\nsystem. The conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty, which we have just signed, is proof of\r\nthis. We are among those who consider that we now have\r\na historic opportunity to insure world security and\r\nstability through the establishment of democratic\r\ninstitutions, sustainable development, respect for human\r\nrights and social justice. This requires better international\r\ncooperation and a new spirit of partnership among all\r\ncountries.\r\nRomania intends to contribute to this common effort\r\nthrough consolidation of its achievements in the building\r\nof a new democratic society based on the rule of law,\r\nrespect for human rights and a market economy, with a\r\nview to establishing itself as a stabilizing factor in the\r\nregion.\r\nIn referring to some of the significant events of the\r\npast year, I will recall that our macro-economic policy\r\nand the progress we have made in the establishment of\r\ninstitutions adapted to a market economy have led to a\r\nsteady improvement of economic performance. The\r\nprivate sector has become preponderant in our gross\r\ndomestic product. In order to overcome the difficulties of\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\ntransition and to prepare for integration into the European\r\nUnion, Romania has received substantial assistance from\r\nthe European Union and its members. The United States\r\nhas granted Romania permanent most favoured nation\r\nstatus. My country has become a full member of the\r\nCentral European Initiative and next year will become part\r\nof the Central European free trade agreement. The signing\r\nof a Treaty of Understanding, Cooperation and Good-\r\nNeighbourliness between Romania and Hungary was a\r\nsignificant event not only for our historic reconciliation, but\r\nalso for stability in Central Europe.\r\nI would also like to take note of my country’s active\r\nparticipation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s\r\nPartnership for Peace programme and in the Implementation\r\nForces operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These\r\nstrengthen our belief that a favourable decision will be\r\ntaken on our integration into the Atlantic Alliance.\r\nAt the subregional level, Romania supported the\r\nmeasures aimed at the advancement of the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation and of the process of stability and\r\ngood-neighbourly relations in south-east Europe, which is\r\nalso the subject of initiatives by the European Union and\r\nthe United States. Aware of the importance of the\r\ndemocratization process, the Romanian Government has\r\ndecided to host the third International Conference on New\r\nor Restored Democracies in Bucharest in early September\r\n1997.\r\nAll these developments and initiatives testify to my\r\ncountry’s willingness to act as a credible and responsible\r\npartner in international affairs and as a stabilizing factor\r\nand source of security in Europe and the world.\r\nOn the occasion of the commemorative meeting held\r\non the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into\r\nforce of the Charter of United Nations, numerous heads of\r\nState — including the President of Romania — pointed out\r\nthat the Organization can and should play a greater role in\r\ninternational relations in order to respond more effectively\r\nto global challenges. It is becoming increasingly evident\r\nthat we are at a point in history when numerous problems\r\nhave to be reconsidered from a global perspective if we are\r\nto forge a common vision wherein the individual is the\r\nfocus of our policies. The main problem to be solved at the\r\ndawn of the third millennium is finding the appropriate\r\nsynthesis between the general aspiration to universality and\r\nthe individual aspiration to identity.\r\nThe series of major global conferences organized by\r\nthe United Nations over these past five years have led to a\r\nnew integrated concept of sustainable development\r\nfocused on the human being.\r\nNow that we are in the process of revitalizing,\r\nstrengthening and reforming the United Nations system,\r\nincluding a limited enlargement of the Security Council,\r\nwe consider it timely and useful to capitalize on these\r\nachievements. It would also be desirable to agree on an\r\nintegrated common vision of development and on a list of\r\npriorities that would inspire and guide the general process\r\nof renewal of the United Nations. By acting in this way,\r\nwe will be able to facilitate our current objective, as long\r\nas the working groups established by the General\r\nAssembly hasten their achievement of balanced and\r\nrealistic results.\r\nAlong with the other Member States, Romania also\r\nconsiders that the moment has come to proceed to an\r\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council,\r\nboth in the category of permanent members — for which\r\nGermany and Japan are preeminently qualified by their\r\nimportance in international affairs — as in the category of\r\nnon-permanent members. This should be done through an\r\nagreed formula, based on proposals already put forward,\r\nsuch as the Italian, which represents a good basis for\r\nensuring that an increased number of States — including\r\nthose of central and eastern Europe — be represented in\r\nthe Council. In short, a special meeting of the General\r\nAssembly should be called on the results of the reform of\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nHaving made these general remarks, I would like to\r\nmake a few comments on particular issues of our agenda.\r\nFirst, with regard to crisis and conflict management,\r\nit is clearly and primarily the responsibility of the parties\r\ndirectly involved to put an end to conflict and to restore\r\npeace and security. We underscore the importance we\r\nattach to dialogue as a means of reaching negotiated\r\nsolutions by the parties directly concerned.\r\nWe will contribute to the establishment of normal\r\nrelations and the full implementation of the Dayton\r\nAgreement among the countries of the former Yugoslavia,\r\nincluding the lifting of the sanctions against the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. We welcomed with interest the\r\ninitiatives on the economic reconstruction of the region\r\nand are fully prepared to take an active part in this\r\nprocess, including through joint cooperation projects with\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nWe express our deep concern over the recent\r\nworrying developments in the Middle East peace process\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nwhich are the object of Security Council resolution 1073\r\n(1996). We welcome the United States initiative aimed at\r\nthe resumption of negotiations between the parties on the\r\nbasis of the principles agreed upon in Madrid and Oslo, as\r\nthey represent the only way to build a just and lasting\r\npeace. Romania recognizes the necessity of strengthening\r\nregional economic cooperation in support of the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East and is actively involved in the\r\nmultilateral working groups.\r\nWe are still concerned about the ongoing, complex\r\nand uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic\r\nof Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an\r\nunconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from\r\nthe Transdniester region.\r\nWe accord due attention to all initiatives aimed at any\r\nprocess that could lead to a lasting peace in the Korean\r\npeninsula and in other regions of tension and conflict.\r\nAs the main guarantor of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the United Nations should participate more\r\nactively in the prevention and management of crises by\r\nemploying flexible peace instruments, including preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peace-keeping operations. The experience\r\ngained by contributing States — including Romania,\r\nparticularly as a result of its significant participation in the\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping Mission in Angola —\r\nhighlights the necessity of increasing rapid-reaction capacity\r\nby improving the standby system and other measures aimed\r\nat the rapid deployment of new peace-keeping operations\r\nand the efficient management of current ones.\r\nWith regard to sanctions, Romania, which has been\r\ndeeply affected by the strict implementation of economic\r\nsanctions, especially in the case of the former Yugoslavia,\r\nbelieves that the United Nations should play a larger role in\r\nthe process of compensating third countries so that the\r\nefficiency and credibility of Security Council actions in this\r\narea can be preserved.\r\nSecondly, I would like to make some comments in\r\nconnection with non-proliferation, arms control and\r\ndisarmament. As a party to the process since its inception,\r\nRomania welcomed with satisfaction the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. This major step\r\nrepresents a crucial stage in the fulfilment of one of the\r\nmain objectives in the implementation of relevant\r\nobligations of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones in South-East Asia, the Pacific and Africa is\r\naimed at the same objective.\r\nRomania will continue to contribute to the promotion\r\nof the review process of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, both before the next\r\nReview Conference in the year 2000, the preparatory\r\ncommittee of which will convene in 1997. We will also\r\ngive equal attention to the speedy commencement of\r\nnegotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile\r\nmaterials, as well as to the implementation of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\r\nand Toxin Weapons and On Their Destruction and the\r\nestablishment of an efficient verification mechanism.\r\nWe again invite all States to consider establishing a\r\ncode of conduct for conventional arms transfers which\r\nwill increase transparency and confidence among States\r\nin that field.\r\nRomania supports all efforts leading to the total ban\r\nof anti-personnel mines. To this end, in 1995, the\r\nRomanian Government declared a moratorium, which will\r\nbe extended this year, and has begun the ratification\r\nprocedures of the additional Protocols to the Convention\r\non Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\r\nConventional Weapons.\r\nMy third and last thought relates to the economic\r\nand social areas, where we believe there are good\r\nprospects for the adoption of the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. Romania endorses the idea that the United\r\nNations can and should contribute to implementing a new\r\nglobal partnership for development among developing\r\ncountries, developed countries and multilateral\r\ninstitutions. We noted with interest the inclusion of this\r\nconcept in the economic communiqué adopted at the\r\nrecent Group of Seven summit meeting in Lyon, as well\r\nas the recognition of the fact that the new partnership\r\nshould be beneficial to all and based on a spirit of\r\nsolidarity that will distribute responsibility among all\r\npartners.\r\nWithin this framework, the United Nations and its\r\ninstitutions should pursue reform and adjustment efforts\r\nwith a view to improving their performance in the\r\nbuilding of consensus in the area of development. We\r\nwelcome the results of the ninth session of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development in\r\nMidrand as an essential step in its renewal. The session\r\npaved the way for the reform of its intergovernmental\r\nstructure, and the reorientation of its priorities in order to\r\ndevelop cooperation with the World Trade Organization\r\nand the Bretton Woods financial institutions. This will\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nlead to the integration of developing countries and countries\r\nin transition into the global commercial and financial\r\nsystem.\r\nWe also note the measures recently taken to strengthen\r\nthe Economic and Social Council’s central role in\r\nestablishing and coordinating joint policies, as well as the\r\ninitiatives of the Economic Commission for Europe and\r\nother regional Commissions in redefining their priorities.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council has the\r\nresponsibility to ensure the follow-up to the major\r\ninternational conferences. We will work together in\r\npreparing the 1997 special session of the General Assembly\r\nin order to improve the implementation of agreements\r\nreached on environmental protection at the Rio Conference\r\nand at the Vienna regional conference on the review of the\r\nSocial Summit in Copenhagen. It is worth mentioning that\r\na subregional conference recently held in Bucharest\r\nprovided a useful evaluation of the implementation of the\r\nBeijing Platform for Action on the status of women in\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe.\r\nWe support the United Nations fight against the abuse\r\nof drugs and illicit drug trafficking, including all forms of\r\nrelated crimes. We intend to participate in the preparations\r\nof the 1998 special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to this scourge.\r\nThe international community must also be mobilized\r\nto confront the rapid rise in transnational organized crime\r\nand terrorism. We encourage more active participation on\r\nthe part of the United Nations. In this respect, we welcome\r\nthe proposal put forward here last week by President\r\nKwasniewski of Poland.\r\nDevelopment assistance requires a new and better\r\nresponse from the international community in the promotion\r\nof our common objective of sustainable and socially\r\nequitable growth focused on the human being and on the\r\nprotection of the environment. Aid flows should be more\r\nefficient and directed towards the countries in real need.\r\nRomania maintains good cooperation with the United\r\nNations Development Programme and its resident\r\nrepresentative in Bucharest, other funds and development\r\nprogrammes — including the United Nations Population\r\nFund and the United Nations Children’s Fund — and with\r\nthe specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nWe insure that the assistance we receive is used for\r\nstructural reforms, and macroeconomic stabilization and that\r\nit likewise contributes to the creation of favourable\r\nconditions for the expansion of a dynamic and\r\ncompetitive private sector.\r\nFinally, I wish to reaffirm my country’s deep\r\ncommitment to the universal nature of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, the promotion and observance of\r\nwhich represent a priority for the United Nations.\r\nIn view of this premise, the Romanian Government\r\ncondemns any form of discrimination and intolerance,\r\nespecially aggressive nationalism, and intends to\r\nguarantee the free and equal exercise of human rights,\r\nincluding the rights of women, children and persons\r\nbelonging to national minorities. We support the efforts\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as overall\r\ncoordinator of the specialized bodies within the United\r\nNations system in improving the efficiency of the Centre\r\nfor Human Rights.\r\nThe best guarantee for the observance of human\r\nrights lies in developing democracy. This component of\r\nthe “democracy-development-peace” triad brings me to a\r\nfinal reflection about the United Nations contribution to\r\nthe process of worldwide democratization. By convening\r\nin Bucharest, in September 1997, the third International\r\nConference on New or Restored Democracies, we wish to\r\ncontinue the dialogue and the sharing of experience in\r\nbuilding democratic societies by contributing the\r\nexperiences of Romania, a country in Central Europe that\r\nis reviving, irreversibly, its best democratic traditions after\r\nso many years of dictatorship.\r\nI wish to assure the Assembly that my country will\r\ndo its best, in concert with all interested countries, to\r\nenable the United Nations — the guarantor of peace and\r\ninternational legality — to respond more efficiently to the\r\nproblems we all share.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Somsavat Lengsavad.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)\r\n(spoke in Laotian; interpretation from French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): At the outset, I wish to\r\nexpress my pleasure at seeing you, Sir, assume the\r\npresidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your election to this very responsible post\r\nattests to the important role of your country, Malaysia, a\r\ncountry with which the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic has excellent relations of friendship and\r\ncooperation in many areas. Aware of your outstanding\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\ncompetence and your qualities as an experienced diplomat,\r\nI am convinced that this session’s proceedings will be\r\ncrowned with brilliant success.\r\nI also wish on this occasion to express my sincere\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nfor the outstanding work he has accomplished during his\r\nfive years in office in the service of the nations and peoples\r\nof the world.\r\nThe strengthening of cooperation for development\r\namong peoples that we have seen in recent years reflects\r\nthe general trend throughout the world. In various regions,\r\nhowever, we must sadly note the persistence of complex\r\nsituations and tensions arising from bloody ethnic conflicts\r\nand religious differences.\r\nEven more serious, we are witnessing interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of States. Hegemonic policies are\r\ntargeted against small States through arbitrary economic\r\nblockades, which constitute new forms of racism and\r\nslavery. This threatens and could destroy harmonious\r\ncoexistence among States and peoples. The entire\r\ninternational community must work even harder to find\r\nways and means to solve these problems as soon as\r\npossible. This is no easy task. We must all be patient and\r\nresolute. If we work together, keeping equity and justice in\r\nour sights as we have done many times, we believe that we\r\ncan reach our ultimate goals.\r\nIn Europe, the Dayton Peace Agreement signed on 14\r\nDecember 1995 to address the problems of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and the recent ensuing elections, marked an\r\nimportant stage in the search for a solution to the\r\ndistressing and destructive conflict in that country. We\r\nappeal to all parties concerned to show maximum restraint\r\nand objectivity in their sincere and rigorous implementation\r\nof the commitments made, in order to restore peace,\r\nstability and cooperation in that region.\r\nIn South Africa, under the resolute guidance of\r\nPresident Mandela, the South African people are trying to\r\novercome the aftermath of apartheid and rebuild the\r\nbeloved country. We pay tribute to the new South African\r\nauthorities for their determination and courage, and hope\r\nthat South Africa and its courageous people will enjoy\r\nevery success in these difficult undertakings.\r\nIn the countries of the Caribbean, economic\r\ncooperation and cultural and other relations have continued\r\nto develop in accordance with the current international\r\nclimate, thereby enhancing peace and security in that part\r\nof the world. Given this logical course of events, we hope\r\nthat the United States of America will adopt a more\r\nreasonable position in its efforts to solve the ongoing\r\nproblem with the Republic of Cuba through sincere\r\ndialogue in order to respond to the legitimate interests of\r\nthe two peoples and help promote understanding between\r\nthe two countries.\r\nIn the Middle East, following the establishment of\r\nthe Palestinian Authority in accordance with the\r\nWashington peace accord signed in 1993, the peace\r\nprocess was a source of great hope. But recently it has\r\nrun into difficulties. Events last week in Jerusalem further\r\ncompound the situation. We are deeply concerned at the\r\nsituation and the Government of Laos hopes that the\r\ncoming meeting between leaders of the parties to the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict will help normalize the\r\nsituation so that the commitments they made can be\r\nrespected in the interest of peace and cooperation in the\r\nregion and throughout the world.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula, the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States are rightly\r\ncontinuing to implement agreements reached, thereby\r\nhelping consolidate peace in the region. We welcome this\r\nsituation, and the Government and the people of Laos\r\nexpress their full support for the deep-seated aspirations\r\nof the Korean people for a situation in which a new war\r\nbecomes impossible and the peaceful reunification of\r\nKorea can take place on the basis of dialogue and new,\r\nsuitable mechanisms that can turn aims into reality.\r\nIn South-East Asia, a movement towards peace and\r\ncooperation has gathered strength. Recently, in Malaysia,\r\nrepresentatives of the countries of the region discussed a\r\nplanned railroad from Asia to Europe, from Singapore\r\ntowards China via Laos. This project would enhance\r\ncooperation in the region. With this in mind, the countries\r\nof the region are trying to work together to solve their\r\nproblems by peaceful means in accordance with regional\r\nrealities. By remaining true to their policies of peaceful\r\ncoexistence and security in the interests of development,\r\nthese countries, including the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, have signed a treaty on the establishment of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free-zone in South-East Asia. This\r\nhistoric event is their major contribution. The Government\r\nof the Lao People’s Democratic Republic believes that the\r\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nby the fiftieth session of the General Assembly is a sign\r\nof the immeasurable success of efforts made by the\r\ninternational community to bring about the gradual\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons throughout the world.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nIn the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the\r\neconomic reform that began in 1986 has borne its first\r\nfruits for our people. Average annual economic growth over\r\nthe past five years, from 1991 to 1995, stands at\r\napproximately 6.4 per cent. The inflation rate is generally\r\nstable, thereby helping gradually to raise the living\r\nstandards of the multi-ethnic Lao populations. What we\r\nhave accomplished has helped maintain political stability\r\nand social harmony. This was why, during its congress last\r\nMarch, the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party gave an\r\nexhaustive account of socio-economic development and\r\ndecided to continue reform unremittingly on the basis of a\r\nmarket economy. It also decided to aim for average annual\r\nnational economic growth of 8 to 8.5 per cent and a per\r\ncapita income of $500 per year by the year 2000. Currently,\r\nour Government is encouraging the various economic\r\nsectors to develop and is helping foreigners invest in the\r\npotential of the country with a view to laying down\r\nmaterial and technical foundations that can help the country\r\nsay goodbye to underdevelopment by the year 2020. This\r\nis a major and arduous task which the Government will\r\nwork hard to fulfil.\r\nIn its foreign relations, the Government of the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic intends to continue its policy\r\nof peace, independence, friendship and cooperation with all\r\ncountries and international and non-governmental\r\norganizations. For now, it will focus its efforts on preparing\r\nthe conditions necessary for us to be able to join the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1997.\r\nThis will enable the country to develop along the general\r\nlines of other countries in the region and throughout the\r\nworld. We are pleased that Cambodia and Myanmar have\r\nindicated that they too wish to join ASEAN.\r\nPositive developments are taking place in the\r\ninternational economic situation. Some countries are\r\nshowing signs of progress. However, there have been no\r\nindications that the world economy will make a speedy and\r\nlasting recovery. Increased interdependence and\r\nglobalization in the international economy have both\r\nprovided new opportunities and caused new tensions and\r\nimbalances, and have, in particular, increased the\r\nmarginalization of developing countries. The entire\r\ninternational community must act together to ensure that\r\nthere will be a more favourable and more equitable\r\ninternational economic environment in which developing\r\ncountries can effectively wage their struggle against poverty\r\nin order to achieve progress throughout their societies.\r\nThe right to decent housing for all is essential in\r\nguaranteeing stability and sound development in the socio-\r\neconomic sphere. We are therefore pleased to note the\r\naccomplishments of the United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Settlements, held in June at Istanbul. The Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic is also pleased to note the\r\npositive results achieved at the ninth United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development, which took place\r\nlast May in Midrand, South Africa.\r\nRecently, the World Congress against Commercial\r\nSexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm,\r\nSweden, seriously considered the troubling situation in\r\nwhich every year, more than a million children throughout\r\nthe world are victims of abusers of all sorts, and\r\npresented various measures to the international\r\ncommunity to combat this new danger which threatens the\r\nfuture of the new generation. The Lao Government\r\nsupports these efforts and is determined to implement\r\nthem in every manner possible.\r\nThe problem of drug abuse continues to weigh\r\nheavily on the international community. Because of its\r\nglobalization, this problem can be solved only through\r\neffective international cooperation founded on the\r\nprinciple of shared responsibility. In recent years, the\r\nGovernment of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has\r\nformulated a comprehensive programme for drug control\r\nthrough the year 2000, which consists in a gradual\r\nreduction in poppy cultivation through the implementation\r\nof integrated rural development projects. Given the\r\nseriousness of drugs in our society, we have recently\r\namended our penal code and laid down more severe\r\nsentences for such offenses. We have achieved a certain\r\nnumber of satisfying results in implementing this\r\nprogramme, although a great deal remains to be done.\r\nWith the cooperation and assistance of friendly countries\r\nand international and non-governmental organizations, we\r\nhope to be able to make even greater progress in the\r\nfuture, which will contribute to the international\r\ncommunity’s effort to eradicate this scourge from the face\r\nof the Earth.\r\nThe environment is one of the issues to which the\r\ninternational community attaches great importance.\r\nDeveloped and developing countries alike have a\r\nsovereign, sacred right to exploit their natural resources.\r\nIn exercising this fundamental right, sustained, economic\r\ngrowth must go hand in hand with environment\r\nprotection, and vice versa. Environmental protection\r\nshould in no way imply a rejection of economic\r\ndevelopment out of fear of damaging the environment. As\r\nthe two pillars of lasting development in all countries,\r\nthese concepts must be mutually reinforcing. It would be\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nunwise, in our view, to emphasize one at the expense of the\r\nother. Only equal regard for these two aspects will\r\nguarantee the success of any development effort.\r\nWe live in a complex and still uncertain world. In this\r\ncontext, nations and peoples throughout the world accord\r\ngreat importance to the United Nations, the only universal\r\nmultilateral forum for the consideration of world problems.\r\nIn order to ensure that it can discharge its great duties, the\r\ninstitution needs to adapt itself to new world realities. In\r\nthis vein, it is essential to affirm the role of the General\r\nAssembly, where all States are represented, as the United\r\nNations system’s principal organ for deliberation and\r\ndecision-making. As for the Security Council, the Lao\r\ndelegation believes that it should be restructured and made\r\nmore democratic, and that there should be a limited\r\nexpansion in the number of its permanent and non-\r\npermanent members according to equitable geographic\r\ndistribution and taking into account the relative importance\r\nof the various countries. In an effort to achieve this goal,\r\ncertain countries, such as Japan, Germany and India in\r\nparticular, should become permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council would thus be in a\r\nposition to meet the legitimate aspirations of Member\r\nStates, and particularly of the developing countries, which\r\nconstitute the vast majority of nations on our planet. In this\r\nvein, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, in cooperation\r\nwith other delegations, will spare no effort to positively\r\ncontribute to the current efforts to strengthen our universal\r\nOrganization.\r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Prince Albert, Crown\r\nPrince of the Principality of Monaco\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert,\r\nCrown Prince of the Principality of Monaco.\r\nHis Serene Highness, Crown Prince Albert, Crown\r\nPrince of the Principality of Monaco, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nHis Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert, Crown Prince of\r\nthe Principality of Monaco, to the United Nations and in\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nPrince Albert (interpretation from French): It is a\r\ngreat pleasure for me, at this fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to congratulate you on your election.\r\nYour wealth of experience in international affairs, your\r\nprofessional skills and your great diplomatic qualities are,\r\nfor me and my country, a guarantee that our work will be\r\nsuccessful. I would like to include in these very sincere\r\ncongratulations the other officers of the Assembly, whom\r\nwe have just elected. I wish them all every success in the\r\nimportant and delicate tasks that lie ahead.\r\nI should also like express our gratitude to and\r\nadmiration for the President of the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, whose very successful term of office\r\nhas just come to an end. He did sterling work in ensuring\r\nthe prestige of the numerous and highly symbolic events\r\nthat marked the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization.\r\nHe gave great impetus to the extensive discussions within\r\nthe General Assembly on strengthening the United\r\nNations system and on the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on the and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the\r\nCouncil. Suggestions were made by the delegation of\r\nMonaco with regard, notably, to the increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil. They appear in annex 11 of the report of the\r\nworking group established to that end.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his efforts to make our\r\nOrganization less costly and more effective. In a\r\nparticularly difficult political and economic situation, he\r\nhas never failed in the mission we entrusted to him five\r\nyears ago.\r\nI referred just now to the difficulties of our times.\r\nThese are major difficulties and often seem\r\ninsurmountable, at least in the short term.\r\nMany factors, sometimes very different but broadly\r\nconnected, exacerbate these difficulties. The major world\r\nconferences on population and development, on social\r\ndevelopment and on human settlements clearly brought\r\nthese factors to light.\r\nIf the sustainable and harmonious development we\r\naspire to is to apply to all human beings, we must also try\r\nto preserve the resources of our planet so that future\r\ngenerations do not find themselves totally destitute one\r\nday. In a vital area for us, the Principality of Monaco has\r\nbeen striving for nearly a century to promote the\r\npreservation of oceans and seas and the priceless\r\nresources they provide, through studies and research, but\r\nalso by taking specific national and international\r\ninitiatives. Accordingly, Monaco ratified the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and intends in\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\n1998 to play an active role, commensurate with our size\r\nand resources, during the International Year of the Ocean.\r\nThe General Assembly, five years after the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development,\r\nwisely decided pursuant to resolution 50/113 to hold a\r\nspecial session to consider and review the implementation\r\nof Agenda 21. This will be an extremely important session.\r\nWe hope it will give us an opportunity to reinforce the\r\nobjectives spelt out at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco is pleased to host next\r\nyear’s seventh session of the High-Level Advisory Board\r\non Sustainable Development and then the International\r\nWhaling Commission.\r\nMy country is thus showing our interest in the\r\ninternational cooperation which is essential if we are to\r\naddress the confrontation between legitimate economic\r\ndevelopment and protection of the environment and the\r\nnon-renewal natural resources of our planet.\r\nOther major concerns which seriously impede\r\ndevelopment remain. No continent is spared the tensions\r\nfelt around the world, which pose a serious threat.\r\nOur Organization does not always have the means\r\nneeded to face up to these challenges and to the most\r\nalarming situations. Nevertheless, we welcomed the\r\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nwhich is finally open for signature and which I will have\r\nthe honour to sign during this session on behalf of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco.\r\nMr. Urbizo Panting (Honduras), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nMight I refer here to the major role played by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency which so ably and so\r\ncarefully monitors compliance with the safeguards\r\nagreements concluded in the framework of the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco has ratified. Together with this, the\r\nAgency very scrupulously seeks to apply, sometimes in\r\nvery delicate circumstances, the decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil in this respect. Its responsibilities in the field of\r\ndisarmament are very substantial. Monaco is therefore\r\nparticularly proud to be the home of the Marine\r\nEnvironment Laboratory, which functions with the\r\nassistance of the United Nations Environment Programme\r\nand the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation has been following very closely\r\nthe follow-up to resolution 50/75, of which our\r\nPrincipality was one of the sponsors, and which the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted on 12 December 1995.\r\nThe strengthening of security and cooperation in the\r\nMediterranean is of concern to us, as it is of concern to\r\nneighbouring friendly countries on both sides of the Sea.\r\nThe Secretary-General has embarked on valuable\r\nconsultations in this respect, and for this we thank him\r\nvery sincerely.\r\nWhen wars break out, once the weapons have fallen\r\nsilent, the painful aftermath remains, including millions of\r\nlandmines, which have a devastating, extremely deadly\r\neffect, scattered in fields and under roads and have a\r\nmassive impact on civilian populations, primarily on\r\nchildren. At the human level, the proliferation of these\r\ndevices causes serious, often incurable, mutilation and\r\nmajor material damage. The Security Council’s 15 August\r\n1996 discussions on demining in the context of peace-\r\nkeeping operations highlighted, if there were any need to\r\ndo so, the importance that the United Nations and the\r\nmajor Powers attach to this question. His Serene\r\nHighness, the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, my father, is\r\nno less mindful of this. He has requested his Government\r\nto provide regular financial assistance to demining\r\noperations by contributing to the fund set up by the\r\nUnited Nations for that purpose. Without offering an\r\nimmediate, complete solution, a moratorium — or, even\r\nbetter, cessation — on the production and export of these\r\nanti-personnel landmines would give us some hope.\r\nThis year saw the holding of the twenty-sixth\r\nOlympic Games. Men and women from 197 countries and\r\nterritories, from very different backgrounds, came together\r\nand tested their strength. They fought peacefully and, with\r\nmutual respect and esteem, created imperishable bonds. I\r\nwas there as Chairman of the Monaco Olympic\r\nCommittee and as a member of the International Olympic\r\nCommittee, and I can attest to the unique spirit which\r\nevery four years brings together the world’s best athletes.\r\nI wish to pay tribute to them. They are an irreplaceable\r\nexample for the young people of our nations. I think it is\r\nright, here, to echo the appeal made by many\r\norganizations that there be more women representing their\r\ncountries at the Olympic Games, and that traditions,\r\nhowever worthy of respect, do not become discrimination\r\nagainst women in the area of sport.\r\nThe cooperation that has grown up between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Olympic Movement, which share\r\nlofty universal principles and values, gives me great hope.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nOur General Assembly regularly bolsters this cooperation\r\nin its resolutions, and I hope that the same will happen this\r\nyear.\r\nThese athletic, dynamic and devoted young people\r\noften work as volunteers for the United Nations and non-\r\ngovernmental humanitarian organizations, and they deserve\r\nour heartfelt gratitude.\r\nI wish too to recall the World Programme of Action\r\nfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, adopted last year\r\nby the General Assembly in resolution 50/81. We must take\r\naccount of its recommendations in every area, particularly\r\nthose of education, employment, health, the environment,\r\nand ensuring full, effective participation of women in the\r\nlife of society and in the decision-making process.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco, which ratified the\r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\r\nof Racial Discrimination and is a party to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child, is very concerned by\r\ncontemporary forms of racism and marginalization. We\r\nencourage the efforts of the United Nations and the Special\r\nRapporteur on this subject.\r\nWe are also seriously alarmed by the development and\r\nscale of child prostitution and the trade in young girls and\r\nboys. An important initiative was taken last August by a\r\nnon-governmental organization, End Child Prostitution in\r\nAsian Tourism, with the assistance of the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Sweden.\r\nWe must all heed the work of the world Congress\r\nagainst Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. I am\r\nsure that the conclusions and recommendations of this\r\nCongress, in the form of an agenda for action, will raise\r\nour consciousness about the seriousness of the situation by\r\nencouraging States to adopt the necessary national and\r\ninternational measures.\r\nBy participating in the Congress, Monaco showed its\r\ncommitment to a world policy to combat the commercial\r\nsexual exploitation of children. On the national level, this\r\nis taking the form of unreserved support for humanitarian\r\nassociations and non-governmental organizations that are\r\nactive in this area and, in particular for their efforts to\r\nsensitize others to this scourge, to prevent it and to\r\nrehabilitate its victims. We are also introducing a legislative\r\ninitiative which should lead to a change in Monaco’s penal\r\ncode before the end of the year, with the introduction a new\r\ncrime: the sexual exploitation of children for the satisfaction\r\nof the vices of others, whether these events occur in the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco or outside our national territory.\r\nOnce this law is in effect, any person apprehended in\r\nMonaco who has committed, in any place whatsoever,\r\nacts that can be qualified as crimes or attacks against\r\ndecency or morality according to the laws of Monaco as\r\nregards minors, can be prosecuted and tried.\r\nI would add that the international community must\r\nalso think about strengthening international legal\r\nprotections in this area, in so far as existing texts,\r\nincluding the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child,\r\nparticularly its articles 19 and 21, often remain\r\ninoperative because they are difficult to apply.\r\nSimilarly, the 1926 Slavery Convention, the 1956\r\nSupplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery,\r\nand the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nTraffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the\r\nProstitution of Others, which are very general in scope,\r\ndo not provide sufficiently effective, speedy recourse in\r\nthis particular area, where emergency action is necessary.\r\nThe strengthening of this protection in the form of\r\na multilateral instrument, for instance, could permit\r\njudicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for\r\nthe illicit commerce in children and their commercial\r\nsexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against\r\nhumanity, that is, that they be considered indefensible\r\nunder the Convention on the Non-applicability of\r\nStatutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against\r\nHumanity of 26 November 1968. Article 1 of that\r\nConvention should thus be modified appropriately. Like\r\nthose stipulated in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention\r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, these acts\r\nshould not meet with a refusal to extradite. The law, and\r\ninternational law, should be fully capable of protecting\r\nthese weak, destitute beings, while leaving no chance of\r\nimpunity for the perpetrators of these vile crimes.\r\nIn addition to strengthening legal protections, we\r\nshould also give some thought to the steps needed to\r\nrehabilitate these young victims, as broadly emphasized\r\nby the Stockholm Congress; without such rehabilitation,\r\nthat these children would fall back into prostitution circles\r\nmight prove inevitable.\r\nAlthough some of the behaviours I have just\r\nmentioned are intolerable and unacceptable, I wish now\r\nto speak of the United Nations Year for Tolerance, which\r\nended in December 1995. Adopted in December 1993\r\nthanks to a welcome initiative by the General Conference\r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, and supported by a unanimous resolution of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nthe General Assembly, this manifestation of faith in\r\nhumankind, concluded with a Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction that were designed to inspire not only high-level\r\npoliticians, but each of us in our daily lives.\r\nIn keeping with General Assembly resolution 49/213,\r\nthe Follow-Up Plan of Action for the United Nations Year\r\nfor Tolerance, accompanied by the Declaration of Principles\r\nthat preceded it and that inspires it (A/51/201), is before\r\nthis year’s session of the General Assembly. It invites us to\r\nmake a common effort to combat political and social\r\nfactors which often seem to be at the origin of intolerance\r\nand hatred.\r\nThis invitation should receive the proper response, for\r\nit could contribute to providing solutions to the tensions\r\nthat persist in the world, some of which, as we know, are\r\nextremely disquieting.\r\nThroughout history, the most important moments of\r\nprogress have certainly occurred during periods of real and\r\nprofound tolerance. Such tolerance favoured thought, the\r\narts, the sciences, the sharing of knowledge and values. It\r\nbuilt civilizations and enabled them to draw together and\r\nmutually enrich one another in an exceptional way.\r\nWhile many today are convinced that history probably\r\nhas no meaning, it remains none the less a fragile and\r\nprecious commodity, largely fashioned by the commitments\r\nand the will of man.\r\nOn 8 January next year we shall commemorate the\r\nseven-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of my\r\nfamily’s dynasty in Monaco. In celebration of that event,\r\nmany cultural and artistic events, some on an international\r\nscale, will take place throughout 1997. This will be our way\r\nof paying a tribute to our past as well as of expressing our\r\nconfidence and faith in the future and destiny, not only of\r\nour country, but of mankind.\r\nOn that note, I should like to conclude my statement\r\nby thanking the President very much for having allowed me\r\nto speak.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank His\r\nSerene Highness Crown Prince Albert, Crown Prince of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert,\r\nCrown Prince of the Principality of Monaco, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mendsaikhany\r\nEnkhsaikhan, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Mongolia\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Mendsaikhany Enkhsaikhan, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMongolia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia,\r\nMr. Mendsaikhany Enkhsaikhan, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): At the outset, I wish\r\nto extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency\r\nMr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia on his unanimous election\r\nto the high post of the presidency of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to express my appreciation\r\nto His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral for his excellent\r\nstewardship of the historic fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe current session is being held at a time when the\r\ncontours of a new international system are still being\r\nshaped. The twentieth century has witnessed the\r\ngeneration of enormous wealth. However, its distribution\r\namong regions, individual States and groups within States\r\nremains uneven. Scientific and technological\r\ndevelopments have led to great strides in the advancement\r\nof human society while they have posed potentially\r\ndisruptive threats to its survival. Trends towards\r\nglobalization and integration are accompanied by the\r\nforces of fragmentation and marginalization. The winds of\r\nsweeping democratic change have touched the greater part\r\nof the family of nations. By and large, the world today\r\nfinds itself at a momentous juncture, at a time of both\r\nopportunities and challenges.\r\nToday no country can afford to stay aloof from the\r\ntremendous transformations that are going on. In\r\nMongolia, this year ushered in a new era. As a result of\r\ngeneral elections held last summer, State power has been\r\npeacefully transferred to democratic political forces for\r\nthe first time in 75 years. This marks the logical\r\nculmination of the 1990 democratic revolution and lays a\r\nsolid foundation for stable democratic development. It is\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nalso a result of the simultaneous pursuit of both political\r\nand economic reforms.\r\nThe reform process is complex, time-consuming and\r\nchallenging. Mongolia is not alone in facing the challenges\r\ninherent in laying the foundations of an open, democratic,\r\njust and humane society and in creating conditions for\r\naccelerated social and economic development. Like many\r\nother developing countries undergoing fundamental\r\nchanges, Mongolia is faced with a host of problems: a low\r\nlevel of development, poverty, unemployment, an external\r\ndebt burden and an underdeveloped national economic\r\nstructure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market. In\r\nspite of those hardships, the Government of Mongolia is\r\ndetermined to undertake decisive measures to speed up the\r\nreform process.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia, while preserving the\r\ncontinuity of its multipillared foreign policy, is resolved to\r\npursue an active, balanced foreign policy based on national\r\ninterests. Mongolia will continue its strong support for the\r\nmultifaceted activities of the United Nations as one of the\r\nmain pillars of its foreign policy.\r\nA few days ago the international community witnessed\r\na landmark event designed to attain the goal of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. I refer to the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nThis morning I had the privilege of signing the Treaty on\r\nbehalf of Mongolia. It is of paramount importance, in our\r\nview, that all the declared nuclear Powers and threshold\r\nStates accede to the Treaty so that the many years of hard\r\nwork that went into it may yield tangible results. With a\r\nview to contributing to an effective implementation of this\r\nimportant Treaty, Mongolia will actively participate in its\r\ninternational monitoring system.\r\nWe believe that the creation of more nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones in different regions of the world will contribute\r\nto the strengthening of regional and international peace and\r\nsecurity. Therefore, we commend and support the\r\nDeclarations of Africa and South-East Asia as nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones. In 1992, Mongolia declared its territory\r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone, and I am pleased to note here\r\nthat the nuclear-weapon States, along with other countries,\r\nhave welcomed and supported our initiative. Mongolia\r\nintends to formalize and upgrade the status of the zone to\r\nthe international level. In a broader context, it is essential\r\nto provide assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States against\r\nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, in the form of\r\nan international instrument.\r\nThe advisory opinion of the International Court of\r\nJustice on the illegality of the use or threat of use of\r\nnuclear weapons, as well as the important\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Canberra\r\nCommission, could serve as a sound basis in further\r\nnegotiations on non-proliferation and nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nWhile expressing Mongolia’s satisfaction with the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention that will soon come into\r\nforce, I should like to stress the importance of its\r\nratification by States with substantial arsenals of chemical\r\nweapons so that the Convention can be more effective in\r\neliminating this type of weapon of mass destruction.\r\nTurning to regional issues, I should like to underline\r\nin particular our deep concern over the uncertain\r\nsituations in the Balkans and on the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe recent events in the Middle East are adversely\r\naffecting the peace process that is under way. We believe\r\nthat the parties concerned should exercise utmost restraint\r\nand resolve the problems by political negotiation, as\r\nenvisaged in the Madrid and Oslo agreements.\r\nThe peaceful advancement of the human family and\r\nits safety can no longer be assured in a world\r\ncharacterized by abject poverty, external debt burdens, a\r\ngrowing technological and economic gap between the rich\r\nand the poor, widespread hunger and malnutrition,\r\nincreasing violence and discrimination, crimes and drug\r\nuse. It would probably be axiomatic to say that no one\r\ncan ensure his or her own security at the expense of\r\nothers. However, merely acknowledging this fact can\r\nhardly help solve the problem. There must be real\r\ndetermination and political will, coupled with collective\r\naction, to face the challenges ahead.\r\nThe recent international conferences on children, the\r\nenvironment, human rights, population, social\r\ndevelopment and human settlements organized under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations have forged a clear vision\r\nand a forward-looking strategy for our common and\r\nconcerted action toward the betterment of the human\r\ncondition. Mongolia holds the view that this new\r\nframework for international development cooperation\r\nshould find its due reflection in the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, which would ensure their integrated and\r\ncomprehensive implementation and follow-up. Vital, in\r\nthis regard, is a coherent coordination of the policies and\r\nactivities of the various entities of the United Nations\r\nsystem and those of the Bretton Woods institutions at the\r\nglobal and national levels.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe implementation of the decisions of the\r\naforementioned conferences requires genuine political\r\ncommitment on the part of the international community and\r\nits individual members to substantially increase the\r\nresources for sustainable human development. We believe\r\nthat mobilization of added financial resources can be made\r\npossible by reducing global military spending and capturing\r\nthe resultant peace dividend for human priority needs. Our\r\ncommon and shared future calls for the donor countries that\r\nhave not yet done so to honour their long-standing\r\ncommitment to the 0.7 per cent target.\r\nWe welcome and support the World Trade\r\nOrganization as a multilateral forum for defining an\r\ninternational trade policy aimed at coordinating and\r\npromoting the interests of countries with different levels of\r\ndevelopment. Mongolia will join this Organization shortly,\r\nwhich will allow it a greater involvement in world trade\r\nand economic integration. Likewise, Mongolia will actively\r\nendeavour to secure its proper place in the Asia-Pacific\r\nintegration, a region characterized by high economic\r\ndevelopment and overall political stability.\r\nHandicapped by their geographical location, the land-\r\nlocked developing countries face particular difficulties in\r\ntheir development efforts. Owing to their disadvantaged\r\nposition, they risk being further isolated and marginalized\r\nfrom the globalization process. In this connection, I wish to\r\nemphasize the practical importance of implementing the\r\nGlobal Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation\r\nBetween Land-locked and Transit-developing Countries and\r\nthe Donor Community, endorsed by the General Assembly\r\nat its last session.\r\nSouth-South cooperation has become a potential\r\ninstrument for accelerating the effective integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the global economy. I believe that\r\nthe conference on finance, trade and investment to be held\r\nin Costa Rica next January will help to further enhance\r\nSouth-South cooperation by identifying its future priorities.\r\nWith the acceleration of scientific and technological\r\nprogress, the question of protecting the environment from\r\nmercantile human activities is acquiring an ever-increasing\r\nimportance. Effective international cooperation aimed at\r\noffsetting the adverse effects of industrialization on\r\ncountries, especially in environmentally sensitive regions;\r\npreserving their unique nature and ecosystems; shielding\r\nthem from natural disasters; and mitigating the damage\r\ninflicted is the order of the day. Furthermore, this requires\r\nan allocation of additional resources and their effective\r\nutilization. Elaboration of a national strategy for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, in line with the Earth Summit Declaration\r\nand Agenda 21, is well under way in my country.\r\nMongolia attaches particular importance to the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly scheduled for 1997 to\r\nreview the implementation of Agenda 21. In preparation\r\nfor that session, a study could be conducted on the root\r\ncauses of the considerable increase in natural disasters\r\nover recent years, as noted in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization.\r\nToday, it is vital to foster respect for and compliance\r\nwith the norms of international law. In this regard,\r\nMongolia welcomes the establishment of the International\r\nSeabed Authority and supports the creation of an\r\ninternational criminal court. We believe that the\r\ninternational community should elaborate the guiding\r\nprinciples of conducting international negotiations — the\r\nmain instrument of bilateral and international diplomacy.\r\nMongolia fully shares the view that the United\r\nNations should be restructured, its activities modified and\r\ndemocratized, and its effectiveness and efficiency\r\nimproved along the lines of the objectives set forth in the\r\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary\r\nof the United Nations. I hope that the ongoing\r\ndeliberations in the high-level Working Groups of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will result in the adoption of specific\r\naction-oriented recommendations that will make the\r\nUnited Nations better equipped, financed and structured\r\nto serve the ideals enshrined in the Charter.\r\nSecurity Council reform should be intensified\r\nthrough the introduction of greater transparency in its\r\nactivities and the democratization of its working methods.\r\nThe expansion of its composition must ensure the fair and\r\nequitable representation of various regions and groups of\r\nStates as well as its increased effectiveness and\r\nefficiency. It goes without saying that, in the final\r\nanalysis, this world Organization can be only as good as\r\nits Member States allow it to be.\r\nLess than four years separate us from the next\r\nmillennium. The time has come for resolute action. The\r\ntime has come to collectively undertake radical changes.\r\nThe time has come to fulfil the dreams of our forefathers\r\nto build a better future for our children.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMongolia for the statement he has just made.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nMr. Mendsaikhany Enkhsaikhan, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Destin-Arsène Tsaty-\r\nBoungou, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and\r\nFrancophonie of the Congo.\r\nMr. Tsaty-Boungou (Congo) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The delegation of the Republic of the Congo\r\nwishes to express to the President its warmest\r\ncongratulations on his election to lead the fifty-first session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nMy country is particularly pleased by this choice, as\r\nit attests to the international community’s recognition of the\r\nconstant and active commitment of his country to ensuring\r\nthe triumph of the ideals of peace sought by the United\r\nNations. I have no doubt that under his guidance this\r\nsession will help humankind take new strides towards peace\r\nand progress.\r\nTo his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral, I would like to express our great appreciation\r\nfor all he did in spite of the trying international conditions,\r\nwhich were continually complicated by human actions.\r\nFinally, from this rostrum, my delegation wishes to\r\nwelcome the tremendous efforts of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali over the past five years. All his\r\nwork has contributed greatly to the specific efforts of\r\nMember States to ensure that our universal institution is\r\nbetter able to meet the many challenges of our times and\r\nmore likely to avail itself of the many opportunities of the\r\ncoming century to ensure that humanity will prosper.\r\nThe idea of humankind prospering leads me to wonder\r\nwhether such a phenomenon can become universal at a time\r\nwhen, despite the efforts of the United Nations there are so\r\nmany differences between nations around the world, so\r\nmany contradictions and conflicting interests between rich\r\nand poor countries and, in Africa in particular, between\r\nthose who wield political power and those who seek it,\r\nfrequently using armed force.\r\nHowever, it must be emphasized that far from being\r\nthe by-product of a sombre period in the history of\r\nhumankind, the United Nations remains after more than half\r\na century, the best instrument for achieving and\r\nconsolidating peace, for the progress of humankind and for\r\npreserving diversity around the globe. It also remains a\r\nplace of legal equality between nations and a crucible of\r\nthe ideals of humanism in which the interests and the\r\ndestinies of all continents and all peoples should be fused\r\nbut not confused.\r\nThis being said, the vision of the founding fathers of\r\nthe United Nations is yet to become a reality. This is\r\npossible only if Member States are truly committed to\r\nstriving for such ideals. Is it Utopian for the increasingly\r\nfragile nations to do this when they are trying to find\r\ntheir own equilibrium? Unfortunately, it is very tempting\r\nto say yes, as our world is increasingly divided between\r\nthose who have knowledge and wealth and those who are\r\nsinking in ignorance, disease, war and poverty.\r\nIn saying this to this Assembly, I, who come from\r\na continent on the brink of oblivion, am not telling\r\nanyone anything new. I beg the Assembly’s indulgence to\r\nrepeat the same prayer, the same cry of distress, already\r\nvoiced here, now and in the past, by our eminent\r\npredecessors.\r\nThey have said many times, more eloquently than I\r\ncan, that Africa, 51 years later, is an ailing continent at\r\nwhose bedside the commonly held notion of international\r\nsolidarity should be translated into resolutions and quickly\r\nfollowed by actions. The wealthiest countries will then\r\nhave helped thousands of human beings to join the\r\nmodern era through scientific and technological progress.\r\nThis is a major challenge that calls for foresight,\r\nhumanism and the mobilization of the richest countries if\r\nour world is to be in a better position to deal peacefully\r\nwith the stakes of the future in the North and the South.\r\nIn this connection, the process of the democratization\r\nand economic integration of Africa should be further\r\nencouraged and supported by the international community.\r\nThis is the basis for liberating all the creative African\r\nforces that used to be held in check by dictatorial regimes\r\nthat were not well disposed to fostering intellectual\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe end of dictatorial regimes in certain African\r\ncountries and the spread of the democratization process in\r\nAfrica does not automatically mean the establishment of\r\ntruly democratic institutions, as the democrats in countries\r\nwith democratic systems may have wished.\r\nCaught between seeking its future and reconciling\r\nthe present with its past, Africa must, with universal\r\nsupport, find modern institutional means of curbing the\r\npolitical tension that frequently results from tribalistic or\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nclannish view of power, which in turn results in the civil\r\nwars that so hamper the continent in its march towards\r\npeace.\r\nSeen in this way, democratic pluralism should be a\r\nmeasure of our march towards progress and, at this stage,\r\nmake peace the stabilizing and constant factor of\r\ndemocratic institutions. It should also, and above all, ensure\r\nthat peace is a decisive factor in human development in\r\nAfrica.\r\nOur continent can no longer take democracy to mean\r\nthe mechanical imposition of some model of democratic\r\ninstitutions while forgetting our historical baggage or giving\r\nin to the temptation to undo with the stroke of a pen the\r\nbases of our social and cultural values.\r\nIt was by seeking a true balance between peace and\r\ndemocratic institutions that the President of the Republic of\r\nthe Congo was able to restore peace in our country after\r\ntwo years of civil war, following the democratic elections\r\nthat brought him to power. By this same philosophy, having\r\nintegrated members of the major opposing political party\r\ninto the Government of the Republic, Mr. Pascal Lissouba\r\nsupports the idea of a necessary period of democratic\r\ntransition. This period is one of adapting the various\r\npolitical actors to the needs of the democratic regime,\r\nparticularly to the principle of political change-over with\r\nthe preservation of our values based upon sharing, solidarity\r\nand respect for authority.\r\nWe are convinced that an approach based on the\r\nconcept of participatory democracy will make it possible to\r\nreduce the sources of conflict between those who have been\r\nelected by the people and those who have lost in\r\ndemocratic elections without affecting in the least the rules\r\nof the democratic regime, particularly the principles of\r\nequality, liberty and the right of the people to choose their\r\nmain leaders.\r\nWe think that African democracy, freed from the\r\ndangers of political individualism, the temptations of power\r\nfor oneself and the torments of tribalism, even with the\r\nlegacy of political systems of the past, can become a factor\r\nfor pacification, a fairer distribution of the fruits of\r\ncollective efforts and social and economic progress.\r\nIn this vision, the present weakness of our political\r\nsystems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic\r\ntransition to a modern developed Africa only if the\r\ninternational community fully realizes that democracy\r\ncannot prosper in poor countries, where politics were for so\r\nlong the road to social success, without exposing our\r\ncitizens to the political games of those for whom the\r\nadvent of democracy and its attendant competitive\r\nelections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy\r\nin society thanks to the exercise of political power. The\r\nvarious civil wars that repeatedly cast a shadow over our\r\ncontinent are sad testimony to this reality.\r\nTherefore, assistance to promote economic\r\ndevelopment in African countries that are committed to\r\nthe democratization of their institutions will result in the\r\nemergence of new political classes that are protected from\r\nneed and that will be more likely to regard politics as a\r\nmeans of governing a community of men and women\r\nwho are bound by a territory and a common destiny than\r\nas the only means to get ahead in an economically poor\r\nenvironment.\r\nAs the Assembly can imagine, the economic\r\ndevelopment of Africa is a decisive factor for stability,\r\ndevelopment, pacification and democratization. The\r\ncurrent world economic situation is clear evidence that\r\nglobalization is inevitable. However, globalization could\r\nalso have serious drawbacks if measures are not adopted\r\nto rectify fundamental imbalances. Increased competition\r\nmeans poor countries, particularly those in the sub-\r\nSaharan region, will risk losing more market shares and\r\nwill be increasingly marginalized.\r\nIf it is first and foremost up to the African countries\r\nto demonstrate that their marginalization is determined\r\nonly by fate and that their current situation is merely one\r\nof those tragic aftermaths with which history has\r\nfrequently sprinkled the course of human events, then it\r\nis also up to the international community as a whole, in\r\nactive solidarity, to make a special commitment to\r\nsupporting the efforts of the African countries to deal\r\nwith the challenges before them.\r\nThis is why I must emphasize the role of\r\ninternational cooperation and, particularly, the importance\r\nof official development assistance for our countries. This\r\nassistance, important in principle, should be enhanced\r\nwith action, in accordance with commitments that were\r\nentered into, in order to meet the needs of the poorest\r\npopulations and to make Governments better able to meet\r\ntheir obligations. Unfortunately, the decrease in such aid\r\nruns counter to this view.\r\nMy country is pleased to note the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Initiative to help Africa, which\r\nreinforces the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. The mid-term review\r\nfalls far short of our expectations, however. The Congo\r\nsupports the recommendations emerging from that\r\nassessment and hopes that the international community will\r\ndo its utmost to respect its commitments towards Africa.\r\nEarlier I mentioned the tragedies of the African\r\npeoples caused by civil war. My country, the Congo, which\r\nsince March 1995 has presided over the Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee of the United Nations on Security Questions in\r\nCentral Africa, would like to say how pleased it is to note\r\nthat in Angola, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nparties are endeavouring to implement the peace agreements\r\nand are thus enjoying the support of the international\r\ncommunity. We must welcome the efforts of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to settle the\r\nLiberian conflict, and we are pleased to note the signing of\r\nthe new peace Agreement, which, in the light of current\r\npolitical developments in that country, gives us reasons for\r\nhope.\r\nHowever, we are deeply concerned by the situation in\r\nsome other parts of the world. The recent, spiralling acts of\r\nviolence in the Middle East and the number of civilian\r\ncasualties have weighed heavily on the peace process. The\r\nRepublic of the Congo emphasizes the importance of an\r\nearly resumption of dialogue, with a view to continuing the\r\npeace process in the Middle East.\r\nThe Republic of the Congo welcomes progress in\r\nnuclear disarmament, particularly the opening for signature\r\nlast 24 September of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT). This historic act strengthens the extension\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) and will promote international relations based upon\r\npeaceful coexistence and trust between States. This is the\r\ncourse of action chosen by African countries in the\r\nPelindaba Treaty, which makes Africa a nuclear-free zone.\r\nWe must express our deep concern over the situations\r\nin Africa in which peace is threatened daily, both within\r\nnational borders and between States. By establishing the\r\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\r\nQuestions in Central Africa, the General Assembly has\r\nestablished a cooperative framework that will enable\r\n11 States from Central Africa to engage in dialogue in\r\norder to build confidence among themselves and establish\r\ntheir own machinery to facilitate the prevention,\r\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts in the subregion.\r\nThe first summit of the Heads of State and Government,\r\nheld on 8 July 1996 in Yaoundé, Cameroon, led to the\r\nsigning of a non-aggression pact.\r\nWe want to express our sincere thanks to the\r\ncountries, particularly Japan, that have contributed to the\r\nspecial trust fund to implement the Committee’s\r\nprogramme. That fund made it possible to hold in\r\nYaoundé, under the auspices of the United Nations, a\r\nseminar for training specialized units of peace operations.\r\nI would also like to express the Committee’s thanks\r\nto President Julius Nyerere for his role in finding a\r\npeaceful solution to the Burundi crisis. The Government\r\nof the Congo calls upon all parties to the conflict in\r\nBurundi, a fraternal country and a member of the\r\nAdvisory Committee, to regain control of the situation\r\nand to create through dialogue conditions for a return to\r\npeace and national reconciliation.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to mention some\r\nrecent developments in the economic and political\r\nsituation in my country. Since the National Forum for the\r\nCulture of Peace organized with the support of United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) in Brazzaville in December 1995 and the\r\nsigning of a peace pact among the various political\r\nparties, we are more than ever determined to address the\r\nmost crucial issues before our country, namely,\r\nconsolidating peace and combating poverty.\r\nAt the initiative of His Excellency President Pascal\r\nLissouba, all the Congolese political forces have signed\r\na framework agreement on census-taking with a view to\r\nprepare the second presidential election of our democratic\r\nera. The recently appointed Government is endeavouring\r\nto organize these elections in transparency, peace and\r\nrespect for deadlines. In order to meet its commitments\r\nthe Government of Congo will be able to count on the\r\nUnited Nations, friendly countries and all those who\r\npromote the consolidation of democracy in Africa.\r\nThe signing on 20 June of a strengthened structural\r\nadjustment mechanism with the International Monetary\r\nFund ensures that our people will support an economic\r\nand social recovery programme despite the many\r\nsacrifices it will entail. These efforts will be pursued with\r\nthe same commitment in the hope that our country will\r\nreceive the support of the international community at the\r\nround table of donor countries to be held at Geneva in\r\nNovember.\r\nCongo, freed from the burdens that have delayed its\r\ndevelopment for so long and mortgaged its future, will\r\nfinally be able to offer its people the peace and progress\r\nfor which they have been waiting so long.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLebanon, His Excellency Mr. Fares Bouez.\r\nMr. Bouez (Lebanon) (interpretation from Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, allow me to congratulate Ambassador Razali on\r\nhis election as President of this session of the General\r\nAssembly and to wish him success in his noble task of\r\nenhancing and strengthening the role of the United Nations.\r\nI would also like to express our thanks and appreciation to\r\nthe former President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his efforts during his\r\npresidency.\r\nHalf a century has elapsed since the birth of the\r\nUnited Nations. Mankind wanted the United Nations to be\r\na bastion of justice, peace and human rights. It is meant to\r\nbe an authority where problems are solved and truth upheld,\r\nwhere mankind can find an organization to defend its rights\r\nwhen they are usurped and stand by its side when it is\r\nthreatened. In founding the United Nations, mankind\r\nwanted to put an end to wars and usher in an era of peace,\r\nof respect for the principle of State sovereignty and of\r\nsafeguarding peoples’ independence and their right to self-\r\ndetermination and to the fulfilment of their aspirations.\r\nWith the telecommunications revolution and the fall of\r\npolitical, economic, demographic, cultural and security\r\nboundaries and barriers, States and their peoples need an\r\neffective machinery for consultation and constructive\r\ndialogue. The scientific and technological revolution has\r\nincreased our need for a greater synergy to face the\r\ncomplex problems of our time and to bridge the gap\r\nbetween the countries and nations of the world so as to\r\nenable them to implement jointly subregional and\r\ninterregional projects that none can do alone.\r\nThe world population explosion and the concomitant\r\necological degradation have made the environment\r\nincapable of meeting rising demand. Competition for\r\nnatural resources and for the protection of vital interests\r\nhave risen sharply.\r\nThe increased number and growing sophistication of\r\nlethal nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons of\r\nmass destruction and the further development of their\r\nintercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of\r\nannihilation for many countries and peoples, especially\r\nwhen some of the countries which possess them lack even\r\nminimal credibility.\r\nSome societies are overwhelmed by the degree of\r\nsophistication of the media, by its role and by the speed\r\nwith which political, economic, social, cultural and\r\nscientific news flows through it. These societies may not\r\nbe ready to assimilate and absorb this flow of\r\ninformation, so they react by isolating themselves, by\r\nwithdrawing into seclusion, or by hiding behind the veil\r\nof tradition to protect their identity. This manifests itself\r\nin the extremism and fundamentalism these societies use\r\nto shield themselves from what is often perceived as a\r\nthreat to their identity.\r\nThese and other problems and challenges require\r\ninvigorating the United Nations machinery and renewing\r\nconfidence in its credibility, justice and efficiency, to free\r\nits decisions from hegemony, eliminate its imbalances and\r\nbring consistency to the standards it uses for the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions. We must do this if we\r\nwant the United Nations to remain a valuable global\r\nauthority and the alternative to destructive and violent\r\nconfrontation.\r\nThe world has witnessed a succession of local and\r\nregional crises. Lebanon, which has suffered immensely,\r\nplagued by the wars of others on its soil, follows with\r\nconcern the developments in different parts of the world.\r\nThe crisis over the sovereignty of the United Arab\r\nEmirates on the Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\r\nMusa islands has not yet been settled. We hope referring\r\nthe case to the International Court of Justice will result in\r\na settlement reaffirming the United Arab Emirates claim\r\nof sovereignty.\r\nWe also support arbitration of the case of the\r\nGreater and Lesser Hanish islands between Yemen and\r\nEritrea; both parties have agreed to such arbitration.\r\nSupport for the unity, security and stability of\r\nLiberia and Angola remains a primary objective to put an\r\nend to the suffering of their peoples.\r\nLebanon likewise supports the Republic of Cyprus\r\nin its efforts to build unity and sovereignty over all its\r\nterritory to put an end to the suffering of its people and\r\nto the effects of the problem on the Government of\r\nCyprus with respect to the reunification of the island.\r\nLebanon has been following with grave concern the\r\nrecent deterioration of the situation in Iraq and the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, who still lack food and other\r\nbasic needs. We do not believe that the recent events\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nrepresent the best way to address the Iraqi problem. We call\r\nrather for the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 986 (1995), and for a commitment to the unity\r\nand sovereignty of Iraq, which would guarantee the\r\ninviolability of the geopolitical map of the Middle East. If\r\na breach were to be opened in Iraq, the consequences\r\nwould definitely extend to other extremely sensitive\r\nregions, which would further complicate the situation. Our\r\nsupport of the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait over all\r\nits territory prompts us to appeal for a permanent guarantee\r\nof its sovereignty and security so that we can turn the page\r\non this bitter chapter of history once and for all.\r\nThe credibility enjoyed by international law is based\r\non its ability to find just and complete solutions to\r\nimportant questions. This is the mission of the United\r\nNations and it therefore should be spared from having to\r\nintervene in less important crises.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations is still called into\r\nquestion and this, in turn, undermines the role of the\r\nOrganization in the field of the non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) has been extended despite the reservations\r\nexpressed by some States, including Lebanon, on the\r\ncircumstances of its extension, including Israel’s refusal to\r\nbecome a party to it. Israel is allowed to maintain a\r\nformidable nuclear arsenal in one of the most sensitive and\r\nvolatile regions of the world without any safeguards or\r\ncontrols; this poses a threat to all the peoples of the region.\r\nThe cessation of nuclear testing has been presented as an\r\nalternative to the NPT. Despite the many promises made\r\nprior to the extension of the NPT that Israel would\r\nultimately accede to it, this has yet to happen. Using double\r\nstandards in dealing with States can only create imbalances,\r\nwhich in turn increases the number of exceptions to the\r\nrule. The effectiveness of the Organization depends on the\r\nequal treatment of all States, and the United Nations\r\nremains the means to implement such policies.\r\nIn this context, Lebanon enthusiastically supports\r\nenhancing the functioning and management of the\r\nOrganization in all areas, particularly with regard to the\r\nscope of representation of the world’s peoples and the\r\ncountries in the Security Council. Recent changes and new\r\nrequirements demand more realistic geographic and\r\nnumerical representation in that body. We need to eliminate\r\nthe perception of hegemony that some have developed\r\nabout the role and decision-making power of the Council,\r\nwhich they seem to believe has been seized by certain\r\nmajor Powers. Lebanon believes that all proposals in this\r\nregard must be carefully studied, particularly those that are\r\ncompatible with the approach I have outlined and that\r\nenjoy broad support among States. I am thinking in\r\nparticular of the proposals of the non-aligned countries\r\nand of Italy.\r\nIn recent years, and despite the many difficult\r\ncircumstances that have accompanied his years in office,\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\r\nmade commendable efforts to further global peace,\r\nsecurity and stability. He has worked to solve problems\r\nof social and economic development as well as those of\r\nhealth in many parts of the world. Furthermore, he has\r\nundertaken numerous reforms within the Organization.\r\nHis term has been distinguished by dynamism towards the\r\nachievement of the Organization’s primary goals. Despite\r\nthe obstacles, his accomplishments are many and the\r\nworld bears witness to them. This continued course, as\r\nseen in a renewed mandate, would be a basic guarantee\r\nof the stability of United Nations policies. Lebanon\r\nbelieves that the renewal of the Secretary-General’s\r\nmandate would make it possible to complete many\r\nprojects and measures undertaken during his first term.\r\nWe therefore call upon States to support his bid for a\r\nrenewed, strengthened mandate.\r\nWe would have very much liked our participation in\r\nthis session, several years following the Madrid\r\nconference, to be an occasion for gratitude for the\r\nrestoration of peace in the Middle East. We had hoped to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the countries, peoples and\r\norganizations which have tried to bring about this peace.\r\nFive years have passed since the Madrid peace\r\nconference, not counting the preparatory year. At the\r\ntime, we welcomed the initiative and believed in the\r\nsponsorship and the subject matter of the conference. The\r\nsponsors were two influential Powers, and the substance\r\nwas geared towards the achievement of a comprehensive,\r\njust and lasting peace on the basis of the implementation\r\nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973),\r\nand with regard to Lebanon, Security Council resolution\r\n425 (1978), as well as the principle of land for peace. We\r\naccepted the invitation and thought that the others who\r\naccepted it had also agreed to its substance, and that the\r\nonly pending issues would be implementation, scheduling\r\nand mechanisms.\r\nBut years have passed, and instead of moving\r\nforward towards implementation, Israel has reneged on its\r\ncommitments and has tried to move away from what was\r\nalready done. As soon as the new Israeli Government was\r\nin power, it adopted its manifesto: “The four No’s” — no\r\nto the withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan; no to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nthe withdrawal from the occupied West Bank; no to the\r\nsettlement of the question of Jerusalem; and no to\r\nrecognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people\r\nin a State of their own.\r\nTo the contrary, the principle of land for peace has\r\nbeen replaced by the principle of peace for security,\r\nmeaning refraining from waging a new war. Instead of\r\nfulfilling commitments, formulas must be changed. Instead\r\nof Madrid, there is the unknown. Instead of putting an end\r\nto settlements, settlements are being expanded. A tunnel is\r\nnow being built under the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in a clear act\r\nof provocation to the people’s sensitivities.\r\nWe were asked to shake hands, to offer recognition\r\nand to normalize relations without knowing what will\r\nhappen to our rights. We, the victims of aggression, are\r\nasked to give security guarantees to the aggressor. Those\r\nwho do not possess weapons are asked to give assurances\r\nto those who have one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the\r\nworld and who could not be convinced to accede to the\r\nNPT when other countries have been forced to accept its\r\nindefinite extension.\r\nSince the new Israeli Government came to power, it\r\nhas backed away from the peace process, although\r\noccasional misleading steps are made. The new Government\r\nof Israel has resorted to a meaningless media campaign to\r\ndisguise its rejection of peace. We first heard the “Lebanon\r\nfirst” slogan, but this too was void of any meaning except\r\nas an attempt at isolation and to serve the purposes of the\r\nmedia campaign. We then heard of the meeting between the\r\nPalestinian and Israeli presidents. Once again, the occasion\r\nwas exploited, but meaning remained absent.\r\nIt has become clear that the objective of the Israeli\r\nGovernment was to numb world public opinion and undo\r\nwhat was agreed upon at the peace conference and the\r\nensuing negotiations. It is perfectly clear that Israel does\r\nnot have a policy for peace. It only has a policy of\r\nchanging formulas, a policy of threats and challenges, a\r\npolicy that Israel can use to further its expansionist and\r\nsettlement schemes.\r\nJust as the world was on the verge of believing that\r\npeace had become possible in the Middle East region, here\r\nwe are facing the unknown, facing the worst.\r\nSome States in the region wanted to precipitate the\r\nearlier optimism by moving to normalize relations. Now\r\nthey bear the burden of Israeli logic. Now the peoples of\r\nthe region have been thrust back into an era of inevitable\r\nconfrontation, violence, and resistance. No sooner had the\r\ndevelopment plans of the Middle East region been put\r\ninto place and the world was showing interest in a future\r\nof peace than mistrust and pessimism returned to prevail.\r\nNo sooner had the historic opportunity for the realization\r\nof a great dream begun to crystallize than this opportunity\r\nstarted to fade, leaving the peoples of the region with\r\nonly one alternative — to confront occupation, arbitrary\r\nrule and obstinacy — since all international peace efforts\r\nare failing. Today’s violence in Palestine and in southern\r\nLebanon is a direct result of the negative positions of the\r\nIsraeli Government. It presages dire consequences should\r\nthe peace process collapse.\r\nSince the Madrid Conference, the United States has\r\ntried, through two successive presidencies, to push the\r\npeace process forward towards settlement. In order to do\r\nso, the United States requested that the peace process be\r\ntaken out of the context of the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council and be confined to the mechanisms\r\ndefined at Madrid. The United States sought to reassure\r\nIsrael by all military, material and economic means\r\navailable, even to the detriment of the Arabs, with the\r\nidea of reviving the confidence of the Israelis. Then the\r\nUnited States imposed concepts to increase guarantees\r\ngiven to Israel to consolidate the peace process, which\r\nwere provisionally accepted, despite the fact that they\r\nwere unsound. Today, these efforts are threatened by the\r\nparty that benefited from them in the first place.\r\nToday, the President of the United States will try to\r\nbring together the parties concerned, pursuing his\r\nresponsibility to salvage the peace. Israel will continue\r\nto manoeuvre, and will exploit the occasion provided by\r\nUnited States presidential elections to undermine the steps\r\nthat were already in place. They will foil the efforts of\r\nthe United States, which we supported even though these\r\ncalled for a continued and somewhat iniquitous tolerance\r\nof Israel, despite the fact that Israel’s excesses had always\r\nbeen covered by assurances for the sake of peace.\r\nWe must return to the foundations of peace as\r\nannounced at Madrid, resume the negotiations from where\r\nthey were interrupted and realize that the opportunity for\r\npeace which had started to crystallize still presents a\r\nhistoric opportunity. It must be recognized that what was\r\nachieved at Madrid is the only foundation acceptable to\r\nthe people of the region. If peace is ever to be salvaged\r\nin the Middle East, this is the only way to achieve it.\r\nLebanon has for many years suffered the aftermath\r\nand consequences of the Middle East crisis and has paid\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\na heavy toll. Today, through domestic political measures,\r\nsecurity, development and economic achievements, Lebanon\r\nis once again proving that it can confront difficulties and\r\nface challenges. Lebanon is showing that its national unity,\r\nthe restoration of full sovereignty over its territory and\r\nrespect for its independence are inevitably more solidly\r\ninherent in its existence than some might believe.\r\nIn the future, if peace is safeguarded, Lebanon will\r\nprove that its history is larger than its geographical borders\r\nand that its role by far exceeds its size. When Lebanon\r\nregains its sovereignty over all of its territories now under\r\nIsraeli occupation, when the United Nations has restored its\r\ncredibility by implementing Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978) on an equal footing with resolutions\r\nrelating to other parts of the world, when Lebanese citizens\r\nare released from Israeli detention camps where they are\r\nimprisoned with only minimal human rights, then and only\r\nthen will the bleeding stop and the wound heal.\r\nThe Middle East is tired of being an active volcano\r\nthreatening world peace. We have for too long been robbed\r\nof peace to the detriment of the entire world. Opportunities\r\nwill not forever remain for those seeking peace. The peace\r\nwhich we sought and for which we have long appealed is\r\nthreatened today. The failure of our endeavours to achieve\r\npeace will close the door to any new attempt in the\r\nforeseeable future. If reviving peace is a difficult job, the\r\nramifications of failure will be even more difficult for the\r\nwhole world.\r\nThe days when problems were confined to national\r\nboundaries are well over, and so are the days when\r\nboundaries were walls keeping crises contained. We hope\r\nthat peace is still possible. But it must be a just peace, not\r\na despoiling one; a real peace, not a theatrical one; an\r\nequitable peace not an iniquitous one. It must be a peace\r\nthat calms rather than one that fans the anger of peoples.\r\nMay God forever guide the steps of those who seek\r\nand work for peace, and inspire those who still oppose it.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nOman, His Excellency Mr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin\r\nAbdulla.\r\nMr. Abdulla (Oman) (interpretation from Arabic): At\r\nthe outset and on behalf of my delegation, allow me to\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. Oman has\r\nlong enjoyed close friendly relations with his country,\r\nMalaysia, and we are confident that given his leadership\r\nand vast diplomatic experience our deliberations will\r\nreach a meaningful and successful conclusion, to which\r\nend we shall cooperate in every way.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay special\r\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral,\r\nthe representative of the fraternal country of Portugal, for\r\nthe exemplary manner in which he steered the work of\r\nthe previous session.\r\nWe also wish to convey our sincere thanks and\r\nappreciation for the unwavering support of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has enhanced\r\nand reinvigorated the role of the United Nations in all\r\nareas of interest, in spite of the problems and obstacles\r\nfaced by the international Organization as a result of its\r\nrecent financial crisis.\r\nOur celebration last year of the fiftieth anniversary,\r\nthe Nations golden jubilee, offered us a unique\r\nopportunity to review and contemplate the tremendous\r\nand substantial achievements of this body over the past\r\nfive decades, during which this international Organization\r\nhas made vigorous efforts to save the international\r\ncommunity from the scourge of war and to alleviate the\r\nsufferings of vulnerable peoples throughout the world. We\r\nare fully confident of the United Nations capability to\r\ndischarge the responsibilities entrusted to it in future by\r\nthe international community.\r\nAlthough the world widely considers the Middle\r\nEast to be a region of great significance, a comprehensive\r\npeace has not yet been achieved there. The international\r\ncommunity witnessed an important breakthrough with the\r\nconvening of the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference aimed\r\nat reaching a comprehensive and peaceful solution to this\r\nissue. Since then, concerted and positive steps have been\r\ntaken to achieve that long-awaited objective, such as the\r\nsigning of many agreements and conventions between the\r\nmain parties to the conflict, particularly on the\r\nPalestinian-Israeli and Jordanian-Israeli tracks. Such steps\r\nhave made the peace process in the Middle East more\r\ndeep-rooted and irrevocable.\r\nAll these attempts have been made through the\r\ncourageous and strenuous efforts of the concerned parties\r\nin the Middle East, with the help of international support\r\nand assistance. My country’s contribution has included\r\nsupport and encouragement of these steps through its\r\ncontacts with the concerned parties at the bilateral and\r\nmultilateral levels of the peace negotiations, notably the\r\nagreement to establish commercial ties with Israel and\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nother accords with the Palestinian Authority, as well as the\r\nagreement reached by the group of founder countries to\r\nestablish a Middle East research centre for water\r\ndesalination.\r\nBecause of the procrastination and hesitation of the\r\nnewly elected Government of Israel fully to implement all\r\nprevious agreements, the peace process in the Middle East\r\nrequires, now more than ever before, the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe peace process in the Middle East is a mutual\r\nresponsibility of and full partnership between the Arab\r\ncountries and Israel. In a partnership, every party must reap\r\nthe fruits of peace or bear the risks and losses. Proceeding\r\nfrom this understanding, all parties must be treated on an\r\nequal footing. Furthermore, my country sees no justification\r\nfor Israel’s continued blockading of the Palestinian cities,\r\nboth from the humanitarian point of view and because it\r\nundermines all relations between the Palestinian people and\r\ntheir Israeli counterparts, as was recently seen in the bloody\r\nconfrontations that occurred in Al-Quds following the\r\nopening of a tunnel by the Israeli Government at an Islamic\r\nholy site. Moreover, the expansion of hostilities at the\r\nexpense of the peace negotiations will serve no one but the\r\nenemies of peace and the supporters of confrontation and\r\nanimosity.\r\nGiven such unacceptable measures, my country’s\r\nefforts to promote the principles of confidence-building and\r\nmutual cooperation in this area will be hampered and\r\ndelayed. We call upon the Government of Israel to close\r\nthe tunnel. At the same time, we hope that the summit to\r\nbe hosted today by President Clinton in Washington will be\r\nsuccessful.\r\nMy country calls upon Israel to assume its primary\r\nresponsibility for revitalizing the peace process by resuming\r\nthe peace negotiations and taking credible steps towards the\r\ntangible and practical implementation of all agreements\r\nreached in this regard. It also hopes that the progress\r\nachieved at the Madrid Peace Conference will have a\r\npositive impact on all tracks, including the Syrian-Israeli\r\nand Lebanese-Israeli tracks. We believe that it is high time\r\nfor the concerned parties to capitalize on the lessons of the\r\npast and work together in order to restore the momentum\r\nof peace and achieve a comprehensive settlement of this\r\nissue. In order to preserve the momentum of the peace\r\nprocess, my country will stand ready to extend every\r\npossible assistance and to take positive steps to enhance the\r\npeace process in the Middle East.\r\nMy country expresses its satisfaction with the\r\nsituation in Iraq in the aftermath of the recent events and\r\ndevelopments in the north of the country, which raised\r\ntensions and nearly destabilized the region again. We call\r\nupon all concerned parties to abide by international law\r\nand to focus on the implementation of the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions on Iraq, as well as to resume\r\nand activate the negotiations between the conflicting\r\nparties, in order to maintain the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq.\r\nOn the other hand, we welcome the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding signed between Iraq and the United\r\nN a t i o n s , a l l o w i n g I r a q t o i m p l e m e n t\r\nresolution 986 (1995). In our view, if implemented, that\r\nresolution will help alleviate the suffering of the brotherly\r\npeople of Iraq. While drawing the international\r\ncommunity’s attention to the irrelevant linkage between\r\nthe implementation of the aforementioned resolution and\r\nrecent events in northern Iraq, and to the humanitarian\r\nappeals inside the country, we call on Iraq to cooperate\r\nfully with the United Nations in a manner that guarantees\r\nthe effective and swift implementation of this resolution.\r\nIraq is also requested to cooperate with the United\r\nNations in implementing other international resolutions on\r\nthe release of Kuwaiti detainees and properties and the\r\nnationals of other countries detained in Iraq, in the hope\r\nthat Iraq’s full compliance and further cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission on Iraq will pave\r\nthe way for the possible lifting of the international\r\nembargo and the restoration of peace and stability in the\r\nregion.\r\nWith regard to the question of disarmament, the\r\nUnited Nations has played an important role in diffusing\r\nthe threat of weapons of mass destruction and promoting\r\nan equitable balance between the regional Powers. My\r\ncountry has participated in the Commission on\r\nDisarmament’s meetings on regional security as part of an\r\ninternational effort to reactivate peace negotiations in the\r\nMiddle East. While actively supporting the Commission,\r\nthe Sultanate of Oman would point out that such efforts\r\nalone cannot guarantee equitable security in the region if\r\nthey are not paired with other effective and practical\r\nmeasures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction there\r\nand to promote comprehensive and unconditional\r\nacceptance of international monitoring and inspection of\r\nall activities related to this matter.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman was also among the first\r\ncountries to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and the first\r\ncountry in the Middle East to ratify it. This is a clear\r\nindication of my country’s distinctive role in enhancing\r\nsecurity and stability in the region and throughout the\r\nworld. Similarly, it is a great honour for me to announce to\r\nthis international forum the Sultanate’s decision to accede\r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT), in the hope that other countries that have not yet\r\ndone so will follow the same course before the end of the\r\nyear so as to ensure the Treaty’s universality and to secure\r\na world free of all weapons of mass destruction in which\r\nall mankind can live in peace, love and prosperity. My\r\ncountry, like many others, voted in favour of this Treaty\r\nand, while we salute all who contributed to this major\r\nachievement, we call on the United Nations not to stop\r\nhere, but to continue its efforts to free the world once and\r\nfor all from all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We call upon the nuclear-weapon States in\r\nparticular to implement time-bound programmes in order to\r\nachieve this noble objective as soon as possible.\r\nWe would like to express our deep concern and regret\r\nvis-à-vis terrorist acts that target the lives of innocent\r\npeople — including children, women and the elderly — and\r\nviolate their legitimate right to live in peace and prosperity.\r\nThe international community should take immediate and\r\ncollective action to combat this phenomenon. We support\r\nall sincere and faithful efforts to convene an international\r\nconference to address and eliminate this problem and\r\nrelated aspects and to ensure that the perpetrators of such\r\nterrorist acts do not go unprosecuted and are brought to\r\njustice.\r\nThe Dayton Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nsigned a year ago, has proved to be the optimal solution for\r\nputting an end to that tragic four-year war, which killed,\r\nwounded or displaced many Bosnians. My country\r\nwelcomes this historic Agreement and made every possible\r\neffort as a Security Council member and at regional and\r\ninternational forums to put an end to the suffering of the\r\nBosnian people and the atrocities committed against them\r\nand to restore security, stability and prosperity to all the\r\npeoples of the Balkans. We hope that the results of the\r\nelections held recently in Bosnia will pave the way for a\r\nbetter and prosperous future in which the people of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina can live in peace, tranquillity and\r\ncooperation.\r\nEffective participation in international and regional\r\nconferences on environmental issues is one of the ways in\r\nwhich the Sultanate of Oman is helping to improve and\r\ncoordinate its environmental policies. My country has\r\nplayed an active role in many of these conferences and\r\nhas hosted some as a contribution to increasing public\r\nawareness at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels. We are fully convinced that, through concerted\r\nefforts, the international community can preserve the\r\nenvironment and the world’s ecosystems. We emphasize\r\nthe need for all countries to participate effectively in the\r\ninternational agreements and conventions aimed at\r\nconserving the ecological system, preventing\r\nenvironmental degradation, enhancing international\r\nscientific exchange and creating an international\r\ninformation network.\r\nIn Oman, we focus consistently on the development\r\nof human resources, the improvement of our technical and\r\nvocational education, the encouragement of the private\r\nsector and economic diversification. Our fifth\r\ndevelopment plan, initiated at the beginning of this year,\r\nhas several objectives, including the improvement of\r\ntechnical and vocational education in Oman, the\r\nencouragement of the private sector and economic\r\ndiversification and the establishment of an economic\r\nbalance conducive to foreign investment. We have also\r\nupdated our tax systems in accordance with an equation\r\nthat would establish a level playing field for foreign\r\ninvestments. A financial centre has recently been\r\nestablished in Muscat to deal with the activities of foreign\r\ntrade and investments in Oman. The commercial and\r\nregional economic groups have had a major impact on\r\ninternational efforts to expand the range of mutual\r\neconomic interests and influence the free flow of trade\r\nand investment throughout the world. In this context, my\r\ncountry has participated with its sister countries of the\r\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in exploring every\r\npossible means to promote and expand free trade and\r\ninvestment among these countries or between any other\r\ninternational groups.\r\nMy country has also participated actively in\r\nfounding a new economic group of the littoral States of\r\nthe Indian Ocean, including several African countries, to\r\ntrigger commercial activity among these countries,\r\ndevelop economic cooperation and maximize\r\nopportunities for the present and future investment and\r\nexploitation of their natural and human resources in the\r\nbest interests of their peoples. We are confident that the\r\nestablishment of such a new economic group, which\r\nembraces many countries with deep-rooted historic and\r\ncultural ties, will ultimately enhance cooperation between\r\nits member States and affect other economic factors, such\r\nas raw materials, human resources and energy.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nHere I would like to talk about Africa. A number of\r\nAfrican countries are still suffering from the aftermath of\r\nthe cold war, which resulted in internal political turmoil and\r\ncrisis, leading to a decline in gross national products.\r\nAfrica’s role is indispensable. We have to help it assume its\r\nnatural place on the international scene. We therefore call\r\nupon the United Nations and the international community\r\nto continue to extend assistance to Africa through further\r\ncooperation with all its regional organizations.\r\nTechnological progress has greatly speeded\r\ncommunications between countries and economic\r\nadvancement. My country welcomes the outcome of the\r\nsummit of industrial countries held last June in Lyon,\r\nFrance, at which these countries reaffirmed their solidarity\r\nwith the international community’s efforts to solve the\r\nproblems and reduce the burdens associated with\r\nglobalization. Similarly, the developing countries should\r\nbenefit from the outcome of the Uruguay Round.\r\nThe developing countries are pushing to adopt market-\r\neconomy policies and undertaking further structural\r\neconomic reforms in support of free trade and investment.\r\nThey are also looking forward to the capital flows and\r\ntechnology transfers that can help strengthen their economic\r\nand social development, improve the quality of their\r\nproductivity and upgrade their services. This in turn will\r\nenable these countries to increase their development, widen\r\ntheir markets and enhance the international competitiveness\r\nof developing countries, creating a more independent world\r\nin which stability and prosperity will prevail.\r\nMy Government has already requested full\r\nmembership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). We\r\nhave been following its work for a year now. Our accession\r\nto WTO membership would be a big step for us. It would\r\nenhance our development, promote our services and\r\nupgrade our productivity standards to the fullest level\r\npossible. To that end, we must guarantee a reasonable\r\nbalance between our national interests and regional and\r\ninternational benefits. In this context, the Sultanate of\r\nOman, as a developing country, has been looking forward\r\nto receiving the global support and assistance which, under\r\nthe generalized system of preferences, the international\r\ncommunity extends to developing countries to help them\r\naddress the challenges posed by economic reforms and\r\nstructural adjustment. In both the short and long terms, the\r\ninternational community should continue to enhance this\r\nsystem.\r\nAs can be seen in its national legislation and norms,\r\nsuch as the national law of commercial signs and the\r\npatenting system which governs new inventions within the\r\ncountries of the GCC, Oman has played a commendable\r\nrole in protecting intellectual property. Furthermore, a law\r\nto protect copyrights and publications has been enacted\r\nin the general context of updating and improving the\r\nlegislation and norms of trade and investment in Oman.\r\nGiven Oman’s support of the principles embodied in the\r\nnew global trend to protect intellectual property rights and\r\nits desire fully to participate and cooperate in this regard,\r\nmy Government has decided to accede to the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organization.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, we are\r\nprompted by hope to continue to work and cooperate\r\ncollectively in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity to enhance life for the current and future\r\ngenerations. Such an objective cannot be achieved without\r\nthe firm commitment of the international community to\r\nreviewing and adopting clear economic guidelines for an\r\nurgent and serious approach to the establishment of a\r\npermanent, effective economic mechanism to deal with\r\nthis matter for the benefit of all of mankind. The United\r\nNations should assume the primary responsibility of\r\naddressing these great challenges and discharge in an\r\neffective manner the global duties entrusted to it by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe appreciate the complexity of the task of\r\nreforming the United Nations and its organs, but we also\r\nbelieve that it can be accomplished through the\r\nestablishment of dynamic and cost-effective mechanisms\r\nfor achieving selected goals and meeting the urgent needs\r\nof future development plans.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s medium-term\r\nproposals for an objective strategy for the programmes of\r\nthe future work of the United Nations. In this connection,\r\nwe express our concern regarding the deterioration of the\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. We urge\r\nMember States to fulfil their financial obligations and\r\nthus enable the United Nations to carry out its functions\r\neffectively. We would also emphasize the responsibility\r\nof the Security Council — its permanent members in\r\nparticular — to their financial commitments to\r\npeacekeeping operations, in coordination with the various\r\nregional and international bodies of the United Nations,\r\nwhich collectively endeavour to secure appropriate\r\nsolutions to international conflicts. We call on the\r\ninternational community to accelerate its efforts to review\r\nand reform the administrative organs of the United\r\nNations in a manner that conforms to the global\r\naspirations and expectations of the forthcoming century.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCoopera t ion of Burundi , His Exce l lency\r\nMr. Luc Rukingama.\r\nMr. Rukingama (Burundi) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The Burundi delegation, which I have the honour\r\nof leading at the current session of this General Assembly,\r\nwould like to begin by taking this opportunity to present the\r\nfriendly greetings of the Government and people of\r\nBurundi.\r\nBurundi attaches overwhelming importance to the\r\nnoble ideals of justice, peace and security which the United\r\nNations has defended and pursued. This is why, even\r\nduring the acute crisis that has rocked our country these\r\npast three years, we have always tried to participate as\r\nactively as possible in these proceedings. We offer well-\r\ndeserved thanks for the Organization’s tireless efforts to put\r\nan end to the fratricidal war we have been experiencing\r\nsince 21 October 1993.\r\nOur delegation welcomes the fitting choice of a\r\nworthy son of Malaysia to act as President of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly of our Organization. We\r\nare convinced that his intellectual and moral qualities,\r\ntogether with his thorough knowledge of the concerns of\r\nthe world today, are undeniable assets in ensuring the\r\nsuccess of our work.\r\nHe can count on the full support and readiness of my\r\ncountry, which has a Vice-President on the Bureau, and we\r\nwill make our modest contribution to ensuring the success\r\nof the work of the President.\r\nWe also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal,\r\nfor the competence and clear-sightedness with which he\r\nconducted the proceedings of the previous session, when\r\nthe United Nations was commemorating its fiftieth\r\nanniversary.\r\nFinally, we wish to express our appreciation for the\r\nrole that His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, has played\r\nthroughout the world during his term of office to promote\r\npeace, cooperation and development. We particularly\r\nremember the important appeal for peace and national\r\nreconciliation he addressed to the people of Burundi and\r\nAfrica during his visit to Bujumbura in July 1995.\r\nDespite the crisis in my country, we believe that this\r\nmessage will finally be heeded by those who opted for\r\nviolence to satisfy their ambitions.\r\nAs members know, the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time when my\r\ncountry, Burundi, is suffering the deepest crisis of its\r\nhistory. The end of the cold war certainly made it\r\npossible for the international community to free itself\r\nfrom the ideological shackles and other constraints\r\nimposed on it by East-West antagonisms. The United\r\nNations has thus been able to focus on its fundamental\r\nobjectives and effectively respond to some of the\r\nproblems the rivalry between super-Powers had long\r\nmade it impossible to solve.\r\nHowever, we cannot but note, not without bitterness,\r\nthat in the post-cold-war period, new, more complex\r\nconflicts have broken out, mostly within countries, that\r\nhave caused serious humanitarian problems. That,\r\nunfortunately, is the case in my country. For three years,\r\nBurundi has been in the grip of widespread massacres and\r\nacts of genocide.\r\nSince October 1993, Burundi has been increasingly\r\nmired in a tragedy from which it seems unable to escape.\r\nThe consensus Government established in October 1994\r\nin the context of implementation of the Convention on\r\nGovernance of 10 September 1994, after lengthy\r\nnegotiations among political parties, has been\r\ncharacterized by suspicion and a lack of trust at the\r\nhighest echelons of State and a serious lack of will to\r\nrestore peace.\r\nThe complicity of the previous administration with\r\narmed groups, massive human rights violations, duplicity\r\nat the top of the State administration and the absence of\r\nleadership have led to denunciation of the Convention on\r\nGovernance and a breakdown in institutions. With a view\r\nto avoiding implosion in the face of the threat of renewed\r\ngenocide, and lacking a credible alternative, the active\r\nforces of the nation requested His Excellency President\r\nBuyoya to take on the burden of responsibility of putting\r\nBurundi back on track.\r\nThe new administration has decided that its priority\r\nis to put an end to massacres and slaughter, to restore\r\npeace and security for all, to end impunity, to reintegrate\r\ndisplaced persons and reconstruct the country.\r\nThe government of public salvation was inaugurated\r\non 2 August 1996. This is a broad-based team that\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nreflects the various ethnic components and political trends.\r\nAll regions of the country have been represented.\r\nThe Government wants to promote solidarity and unity\r\nto ensure the success of its transitional programme, which\r\nwill last three years. Its plan of action was made public\r\nrecently by the Prime Minister, His Excellency\r\nMr. Pascal Firmin Ndimira. Its aim is to make good the\r\ncommitment entered into by the Head of State to bring\r\nBurundi back to the path of peace, security and prosperity\r\nby means of dialogue and national debate.\r\nThe changes in Burundi since 25 July 1996 have been\r\nwelcomed by the population of Burundi as a rescue\r\noperation. The messages of support from all quarters and\r\nthe spontaneous demonstrations throughout the country\r\nwere visible signs of the support of the people of Burundi\r\nfor the new administration, which has come to the\r\nassistance of a country that was on the brink.\r\nHowever, some countries, particularly our neighbours,\r\nwere slow to realize the need, if we were to avoid genocide\r\nin Burundi and maintain the sovereignty of the country, to\r\nestablish an administration that would bring people together\r\nin the quest for security, not of one ethnic group to the\r\ndetriment of others, but of all.\r\nThis was therefore not an attempt to undermine\r\ndemocracy, as some claim. The Government wants, instead,\r\nto end the massacre of innocent populations battling with\r\nthe various armed factions within the country and outside,\r\nfrom the capital to the heart of Burundi, to restore peace\r\nand security for all and create conditions conducive to\r\ncomprehensive democratization based on national realities.\r\nThe efforts being undertaken by the new\r\nadministration to restore peace and organize dialogue and\r\nnational debate have been hampered by the economic\r\nsanctions against Burundi. I am duty-bound to draw the\r\nattention of representatives here to the damaging effects of\r\nthe economic blockade imposed on my country at the\r\nSecond Arusha Regional Summit on Burundi on\r\n31 July 1996. The international community must not, one\r\nday, say that it did not know. The countries of our\r\nsubregion were more than anyone else aware of the chaotic\r\nand complicated situation in Burundi before 25 July 1996.\r\nThey also knew of the almost total institutional paralysis as\r\na result of the crisis. Every day they see my country’s\r\ncontinuous struggle to restore peace and security despite the\r\nhost of difficulties before us.\r\nWe therefore see the embargo imposed on Burundi\r\nas unfriendly, unjust and illegal. It violates international\r\npublic law and the international accords and conventions\r\nthat our countries have ratified. The embargo, which is\r\nreally a total economic blockade against my country,\r\nconstitutes a dangerous precedent, violating Article 1,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nregarding the right of peoples to self-determination and\r\nthe sovereignty and equality of States.\r\nThis blockade flouts the principle of non-interference\r\nin the internal affairs of other States as stipulated in\r\nArticle III, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Declaration of\r\n24 October 1970 adopted by the General Assembly on the\r\nduty of States to refrain from interfering in the domestic\r\naffairs of other States.\r\nThe nature of the sanctions adopted flies in the face\r\nof the principle of the non-use of force and the peaceful\r\nsettlement of international disputes in accordance with the\r\nDeclaration of 24 October 1970 adopted by the General\r\nAssembly. We know that States are prohibited from using\r\nforce against another State, even in the case of damages\r\ncaused by the latter.\r\nIn the case of Burundi, there was no damage to any\r\nof our neighbours. However, our access to the sea, our\r\nright of transit and our freedom of trade have been taken\r\naway. The illegality of the embargo is obvious, since\r\ninternational and regional treaties recognizing Member\r\nStates’ freedom of transit have been violated.\r\nThese instruments include the Marrakesh Agreement\r\nestablishing the World Trade Organization, the treaty on\r\nthe Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa, the\r\nConvention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States, not\r\nto mention the charters and agreements of neighbouring\r\ncountries, such as the Economic Community of the Great\r\nLakes Countries and the preferential trade area.\r\nWhat is worse — and we would emphasize this here\r\nbefore the General Assembly — the sanctions imposed\r\nare hindering the action of our Government, weakening\r\nthe chances for peace and working in favour of the\r\nextremist militias and armed bands, which feel\r\nencouraged by them. At this very moment, the latter are\r\nusing the embargo to intensify their acts of violence and\r\ndestruction in the country.\r\nThe embargo imposed on Burundi has had\r\ncatastrophic consequences on people who, as a result, find\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nthemselves deprived of urgently needed medications,\r\nvaccines, diagnostic materials and surgical instruments.\r\nToday, children, women and the elderly are dying.\r\nThe vaccination rate, which, because of three years of\r\nwar, has fallen from 80 per cent to 30 per cent among\r\nchildren under five years of age, may soon reach zero if\r\nnothing is done to improve the situation in the meantime.\r\nThat will necessarily have an impact on the most vulnerable\r\nmembers of the population. Further, the population of\r\nBurundi is at risk of widespread famine, which will have\r\nunfortunate consequences for the inhabitants of\r\nneighbouring countries. It will have a greater impact on the\r\nmost vulnerable, namely, displaced persons, the homeless\r\nand the repatriated, which latter group has already been\r\nliving for three years now in inhuman conditions. Nearly\r\n80 per cent of them are children, women and the elderly.\r\nLastly, owing to lack of fuel and non-availability of\r\neducational materials, a large number of pupils and students\r\nmay leave school. The drop-out rate is already 18 per cent\r\nfor secondary education, 21 per cent for technical training\r\nand 20 per cent for university studies.\r\nAs for the economic aspects of the embargo, I would\r\npoint out that Burundi lives essentially on agriculture and\r\nanimal husbandry. There will be a sharp decline in our\r\nharvest if fertilizers, concentrates and veterinary\r\npharmaceuticals continue to be held by embargo in the\r\nports of neighbouring countries. The result will obviously\r\nbe widespread famine.\r\nThe few industries still operating are gradually\r\nshutting down owing to lack of raw materials. State\r\nrevenues are at a dangerously low level because of our\r\ninability to export and import. That will lead to\r\nunemployment or inability to pay workers in both the\r\npublic and private sectors and foment social unrest that will\r\nincrease insecurity and destabilize the country. Overall, the\r\nsituation will favour the retaking of territory and strengthen\r\nthe armed actions of rebel groups and other outlaw bands\r\nagainst the peaceful population, with the risk of widespread\r\ncivil war.\r\nThis apocalyptic prospect can and must be avoided.\r\nThe neighbouring countries behind the embargo had\r\ndemanded that the new regime end its suspension of the\r\nNational Assembly and political parties and commit itself\r\nto dialogue with the armed groups, points that are priorities\r\nof the new regime’s programme made public on\r\n25 July 1996. Decree Number 100-023 of\r\n13 September 1996 has just reinstated Parliament, the\r\npolitical parties and political associations.\r\nFurthermore, the Government of Burundi has just\r\nreiterated its solemn commitment to engage in dialogue\r\nand to discuss all the country’s fundamental questions\r\nwith all interested political partners, including armed\r\ngroups. We renew that commitment here before the\r\nAssembly.\r\nThat measure, which is already a priority of the new\r\nregime, was the latest recommendation of the Arusha\r\nSummit Meeting on 31 July 1996. Now that my\r\nGovernment has responded positively and promptly to the\r\nconditions fixed by its neighbours, we invite them to take\r\nall appropriate steps to lift the embargo immediately so as\r\nto alleviate the indescribable suffering of the people of\r\nBurundi and to enable dialogue — which is also hindered\r\nby the embargo — to take place by opening lines of\r\ncommunication, both on the ground and in the air, and by\r\nfulfilling their commitments.\r\nMy country, Burundi, seeks to play an active and\r\nconstructive role in the development of peaceful, friendly\r\nand mutually beneficial relations with countries of the\r\nregion and the rest of the world. In return, we require of\r\nour partners that they refrain from threat or use of force\r\nor from any other action incompatible with the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nBecause of the war and the embargo, my country\r\ncontinues to suffer from a very critical economic\r\nsituation. It is land-locked and therefore must rely on its\r\nneighbours for the transit of its exports and imports. For\r\nthat reason, we attach great importance to the policy of\r\ngood-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other States.\r\nMy Government is perfectly well aware of the\r\nconcerns of the international community over the crisis in\r\nBurundi. We express our gratitude to all our bilateral and\r\nmultilateral partners that have given us their support,\r\nsolidarity and understanding in this difficult period.\r\nHowever, we remain convinced that the imposition\r\nof conditions about the pace and the way to resolve the\r\ncurrent conflict cannot benefit the people of Burundi. We\r\nare determined to find lasting and definitive solutions to\r\nthe evil that is eroding Burundi, but such complex\r\nproblems cannot be resolved by precipitate action or by\r\nholding a knife to our throats.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe political situation in the Great Lakes region\r\ncontinues to be cause for concern. This geographical area\r\nholds the sad world record for number of refugees.\r\nFollowing the genocide carried out in Rwanda in April\r\n1994, several hundreds of thousands of persons sought\r\nasylum in neighbouring countries, particularly in Zaire and\r\nTanzania.\r\nFollowing the crisis of October 1993, those countries\r\nalso contained tens of thousands of Burundi’s citizens, who\r\nswelled the ranks of those gone into exile. In\r\nFebruary 1995 an international Conference about this thorny\r\nquestion was held in Bujumbura, under the auspices of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\r\nNations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nThe decisions and recommendations made at that time have\r\nremained virtually a dead letter. However, we have noted\r\nthe voluntary and peaceful repatriation of a large number of\r\nRwandan refugees who had sought asylum in Burundi.\r\nThe OAU and the United Nations, through the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,\r\nshould step up their initiatives designed to encourage all\r\npersons who wish to return to their countries once the\r\nconditions of peace and security have been met. The\r\nauthorities of the countries concerned must, of course, play\r\na primary role. The Government of Burundi, for its part, is\r\nprepared to welcome at any time all of our nationals who\r\nwish to return to their respective homes. To that end, it is\r\nnow organizing and doing all it can to bring about the rapid\r\nrestoration of a climate of peace, understanding and\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nWe encourage all efforts being made by neighbouring\r\ncountries, by friendly countries, the Organization of African\r\nUnity, the European Union and the United Nations on\r\nbehalf of this troubled region and to return the situation as\r\na whole to normal.\r\nAt the same time, we draw the attention of the\r\ninternational community to other scourges and other\r\nphenomena that are rife in this geographical area. I am\r\nreferring to the trafficking in and proliferation of weapons\r\nand the training of militias and armed groups that foment\r\nterrorism and threaten the security of our fellow citizens\r\nfrom certain neighbouring countries.\r\nWe note the spread of the ideology of genocide,\r\nhatred, violence and marginalization made manifest in\r\nintolerance and ethnic fundamentalism. The pernicious ideas\r\npropagated by the champions of those ideologies will, in\r\nthe long term, generate social upheavals with political and\r\nethnic roots that will in turn cause enormous human and\r\nmaterial damage. The genocide in Rwanda, the massacres\r\nperpetrated in Burundi since the October 1993 crisis, the\r\nkillings we have witnessed in South Kivu, in particular in\r\nthe Massissi region and very recently in the region of\r\nUvira, are the best example of this threat to peace and\r\nsecurity in our subregion.\r\nThe international community must mobilize to\r\ncombat such inhuman and degrading acts, whose\r\nphilosophy is so strangely reminiscent of notorious\r\nHitlerite nazism.\r\nWith regard to the other conflicts with which Africa\r\nis beset, the Government of Burundi welcomes the\r\npositive developments in the situation in Somalia and in\r\nLiberia. It appreciates the decisive role played by the\r\nOAU, the United Nations and subregional organizations\r\nin helping to sort out differences and commit the parties\r\nto disputes to a process of peace and reconciliation.\r\nIn that connection, my Government welcomes the\r\nestablishment by the OAU of a Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. African leaders\r\nhave thereby demonstrated their determination to become\r\nmore involved in solving problems on their own\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our thanks to the\r\nEuropean Union, the United Nations and other bilateral\r\npartners for the political, material and financial support\r\ngiven that initiative. To that end, Burundi is convinced of\r\nthe overriding importance of preventive diplomacy and\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation.\r\nThe United Nations has two main priorities, namely,\r\nthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.\r\nTheir success entails a determined struggle against\r\nterrorism and organized crime as well as the elimination\r\nof the nuclear threat. Burundi therefore supports the\r\norganization of an international criminal tribunal.\r\nBurundi’s representative to the United Nations has\r\njust signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nMy Government warmly welcomes that noble decision by\r\nthe General Assembly of our Organization. It is a signally\r\nimportant step towards the establishment of a world of\r\npeace free from the threat of meaningless death caused by\r\nman himself.\r\nThe Government of Burundi is also concerned about\r\nother contemporary scourges, such as the trafficking in\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nand the distribution and consumption of drugs and other\r\npsychotropic substances. They are a grave danger,\r\nespecially for our young people who are our future. Apart\r\nfrom their deleterious effects on health, they are a\r\nformidable weapon in the hands of the supporters of\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nFor that reason, we wholeheartedly support efforts\r\nbeing made within the framework of international\r\ncooperation to eradicate that disaster confronting humanity.\r\nWe emphasize this fact, for armed groups that are\r\norganized to rob, rape, burn and kill sate themselves with\r\nthese harmful substances to kill in cold blood, without\r\nremorse and without pity.\r\nSeveral delegations have recognized the fact that many\r\nAfrican Governments are increasingly committed to\r\nshouldering their responsibilities for the development of\r\ntheir continent. It has been noted, in particular, that over the\r\npast two years the average growth rate in gross domestic\r\nproduct has reached 5 per cent. Those efforts deserve encouragement.\r\nNevertheless, the burden of external debt continues to\r\nweigh heavily on many of our countries and often\r\nundermines their development efforts. That is why the\r\nGovernment of Burundi pleads for the substantial easing of\r\nexternal debt in order to give every chance to programmes\r\naimed at improving the living standard of our people.\r\nI should like to join other eminent heads of delegation\r\nwho have spoken earlier in announcing that my\r\nGovernment shares the hope that our Organization will be\r\nreformed and made into an efficient and effective\r\ninstrument better able to respond to the purposes and\r\nprinciples assigned it by its founding fathers. The United\r\nNations must adapt its structures and working methods to\r\nthe current and future concerns of our planet and all\r\nhumankind.\r\nWe view with special attention the ongoing\r\ndiscussions on restructuring the Security Council to allow\r\nfor more equitable representation in that body, to increase\r\nits membership and to achieve its general democratization.\r\nGiven their political and economic advantages, Germany\r\nand Japan have legitimate aspirations for permanent seats\r\nin the Security Council, as does Italy. Since none of the\r\nproposals before us commands general support, it is just as\r\nlegitimate to take into account the cogent suggestion put\r\nforward by Italy for a possible rotation of permanent seats\r\namong States of respective regions. We believe that Africa,\r\nAsia and Latin America should have at least two permanent\r\nseats per region in that lofty, decision-making body of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy country, Burundi, wishes to reaffirm its total\r\ncommitment to and unswerving support for the noble\r\nideas upheld by the Organization. We hope that the\r\nUnited Nations will continue to move forward in the\r\nstruggle against racism, intolerance, xenophobia, terrorism\r\nand child prostitution. It is our ardent desire to see this\r\nvast home of mankind promote and further promulgate\r\nthe values of peace, freedom and mutual respect and\r\nfraternity among men in order to stave off for all time the\r\nspectre of war, hunger and famine in the world, through\r\na more generous and more committed international\r\ncooperation. All countries of the world, rich and poor,\r\nsmall and large, are urged to join forces to meet that\r\nchallenge: the challenge of building a better future in a\r\nmore just, more peaceful, more human world.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
