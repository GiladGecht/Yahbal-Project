(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker this afternoon is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi, on whom\r\nI now call.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): It gives me great pleasure to extend to you,\r\nSir, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab\r\nEmirates, our congratulations on your election as President\r\nof this session of the General Assembly. Your election is\r\nindeed an expression of the international community’s faith\r\nin your competence and vast diplomatic expertise, and of\r\nthe high esteem in which we hold your friendly country,\r\nMalaysia. At the same time, allow me to thank sincerely\r\nyour predecessor, who so ably led the deliberations of the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a\r\nwarm tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the positive and important role he has\r\nplayed in the past few years. My country supports his\r\nre-election for a second term and appreciates his efforts to\r\nenhance the role of the Organization in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe fifty-first session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly is being held amid new international\r\ncircumstances and developments that have both positively\r\nand negatively affected the global scene. Despite the\r\nrelative optimism that has permeated international\r\nrelations, threats to peace and security and to economic,\r\nsocial and human development worldwide still remain.\r\nThe present détente in regional and international relations\r\ndoes not necessarily mean that the international climate\r\nhas become more harmonious or homogenous. The\r\nsecurity and political independence of small States is still\r\nthreatened by the ambitions of States aspiring to spread\r\ntheir hegemony and expand at the expense of their\r\nneighbours.\r\nThe political situation in the Arabian Gulf region\r\nduring the past two decades has made us increasingly\r\nconvinced of the importance of rebuilding confidence\r\namong the countries of the region. This confidence must\r\nbe anchored in the principles of full and mutual respect\r\nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, and of\r\nrefraining from the threat or use of force. Every State has\r\nthe right to choose its political, economic and social\r\nsystem, to preserve its natural resources and to resort to\r\npeaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes\r\nwithin the context of bilateral, regional and international\r\ninitiatives and endeavours.\r\nWe also support the peaceful efforts currently under\r\nway to complete the demarcation of borders among the\r\nStates of the region in order to enhance the national\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nsovereignty of each State. This will contribute to the\r\nachievement of lasting peace, security and stability in the\r\nregion.\r\nInspired by our tradition, our history and our\r\ncommitment to peace, we in the United Arab Emirates\r\nfirmly believe that the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe principles of international law are the proper means of\r\nsettling disputes among nations.\r\nTwenty-five years have passed since the occupation by\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran of our three islands, Greater\r\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. These are Arab islands,\r\nboth in their history and in their origin. They are the pillars\r\nof our national sovereignty, territorial integrity and overall\r\ninalienable national rights. Since the beginning of the\r\nconflict, the United Arab Emirates has called on the Iranian\r\nGovernment to end its occupation of the islands and to\r\nenter into bilateral negotiations or seek the arbitration of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Referring the case to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice will ensure that each State has\r\na chance to submit the relevant legal and historical\r\ndocuments and evidence to support its claim of sovereignty\r\nover the three islands.\r\nDespite our declared peaceful intentions, the mediation\r\nefforts of some friendly countries and the good offices of\r\nthe Secretary-General, the Iranian Government rejected our\r\npeaceful endeavours. It has established and equipped\r\nfacilities on the three islands whose features are not\r\nexclusively civilian. It has built an electrical power plant on\r\nGreater Tunb; and an airport, a refrigeration plant and a\r\nfish-processing plant on Abu Musa. Moreover, Iranian\r\nnationals, mostly from the military, have been settled on the\r\nislands. We view this as a clear act of provocation aimed\r\nat changing the demographic character of the islands and\r\nimposing a new fait accompli. Through these acts and by\r\nignoring the repercussions of such a policy on the peace\r\nand security of the region and on international navigation,\r\nIran has consolidated its illegitimate occupation.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to heed the\r\nrepeated, serious and sincere appeals made by the United\r\nArab Emirates, the Gulf Co-operation Council, the Arab\r\nStates of the Gulf, the last Arab Summit meeting, the\r\nCouncil of the League of Arab States and the States parties\r\nto the Damascus Declaration to settle the dispute through\r\npeaceful means. This violates not only our country’s\r\nnational sovereignty, but also international law and all the\r\ninternational principles, norms and practices governing\r\nrelations among States, particularly among neighbouring\r\nStates.\r\nWe therefore call on the Government of Iran to\r\ndismantle all the illegitimately established civilian and\r\nmilitary facilities on our three islands. We also call upon\r\nIran to respond to the peace initiatives we have advanced\r\nand which are supported by sisterly and friendly peace-\r\nloving countries; to enter into unconditional bilateral\r\nnegotiations conducive to a peaceful settlement of the\r\ndispute; or to refer the case to the International Court of\r\nJustice.\r\nSecurity, stability and sustainable development are\r\nurgent needs of societies all over the globe. My country,\r\nwhich has always supported the inalienable rights of\r\npeoples to resist occupation and aggression, condemns all\r\nforms of terrorism and the acts of subversion and\r\nsabotage facing the international community today. In this\r\nconnection, we agree with and support all the measures\r\ntaken by the State of Bahrain to preserve its security, its\r\nnational sovereignty and its political independence.\r\nIn this context, we reiterate our full support for the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia in its fight against terrorism in\r\nall its forms and manifestations, and against all threats to\r\nits national security. We believe that the member States\r\nof the Gulf Co-operation Council are bound by the\r\nthreads of a common destiny defined by the requirements\r\nof peace and security of the whole region. Terrorism\r\ndefies all international norms and practices and runs\r\ncounter to religious and cultural beliefs, which are the\r\npillars of stability and prosperity for all societies. It must\r\ntherefore be addressed in an international context.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has followed with grave\r\nconcern the recent developments in Iraq. We reaffirm the\r\nimportance we attach to preserving Iraq’s national\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We oppose any\r\ninterference in its internal affairs and the establishment by\r\nneighbouring States of safety zones on its territory. In the\r\nsame context, we support all the measures taken by the\r\nState of Kuwait to preserve its sovereignty, security and\r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nThe escalating human suffering of the Iraqi people\r\nand the spread of disease and malnutrition call for the\r\nimmediate and full implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 986 (1995). However, the ultimate\r\nresponsibility for the alleviation of the suffering of the\r\nIraqi people rests solely with the Government of Iraq.\r\nThis can be realized only when the Iraqi Government\r\ncomplies fully with its international obligations under the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Those obligations\r\ninclude the release of all Kuwaitis and other nationals\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nimprisoned or detained by Iraq and the return of all Kuwaiti\r\nproperty still in its possession.\r\nMy country supported the Agreement on Principles\r\nconcluded between the Republic of Yemen and Eritrea on\r\nthe Hanish archipelago. We renew our call to the two\r\nGovernments to commit to the principle of peaceful\r\nsettlement through international arbitration so that peace\r\nand security can prevail in this region. We take this\r\nopportunity to express our appreciation to the Government\r\nof France for its mediation efforts.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomed the peace\r\nnegotiations in the Middle East, beginning with the Madrid\r\nConference through the subsequent agreements relative to\r\nthe question of Palestine. We are disappointed by the\r\nposition of the Israeli Government, which has not honoured\r\nthe commitments entered into by its predecessor. The Israeli\r\nGovernment has refused to withdraw from the city of\r\nHebron, and has embarked on an expansion of its\r\nillegitimate settlement activities. More recently, it opened\r\na tunnel adjacent to Al-Haram al-Sharif, the Noble\r\nSanctuary, which threatens the structures of the Al-Aqsa\r\nMosque and alters the demographic character and legal\r\nstatus of the city of Jerusalem. This is an act of provocation\r\nthat will arouse the feelings of Arabs and Muslims, and will\r\nobstruct the achievement of a just, comprehensive and\r\nlasting peace settlement to the Middle East problem and the\r\nPalestinian question.\r\nAt the Security Council meeting held last week, the\r\ninternational community reaffirmed its solidarity with the\r\nPalestinian people, its support of the peace process, and its\r\nopposition to all the measures recently taken by the Israeli\r\nGovernment. The United Arab Emirates condemns all the\r\nacts of violence recently committed by the Israeli occupying\r\nauthorities against the Palestinian people, which resulted in\r\nfiring at and thus the martyrdom of many Palestinians, in\r\naddition to the injuries sustained by many more. We call on\r\nthe Israeli Government to put an end to its barbaric\r\npractices, which run counter to the most basic norms of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nThe Arab parties are determined to pursue the peace\r\nprocess as an objective and a strategic option to which there\r\nis no alternative. This calls for a reciprocal commitment by\r\nthe Israeli side, without any further delay or procrastination.\r\nThis commitment must be proven by the actual,\r\nunconditional implementation of all relevant agreements\r\nthus far concluded, to enable the Palestinian people to\r\nexercise their legitimate rights, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination and to the establishment of their own\r\nindependent State, with Jerusalem as its capital. It must\r\nalso include full Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan\r\nto the 4 June 1967 line, and from southern Lebanon and\r\nthe western Bekaa, to the internationally recognized\r\nb o r d e r s , p u r s u a n t t o S e c u r i t y C o u n c i l\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and\r\nthe principle of land for peace. These measures will\r\nguarantee balanced and equitable security for all the\r\nStates of the region, and realize their peoples’ aspirations\r\nfor a new era of comprehensive economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe fully subscribe to the international call for a\r\nregional and international nuclear-test ban, and for the\r\nestablishment of international zones free of all weapons\r\nof mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. These\r\nweapons pose a grave danger to our health, our\r\nenvironment and our natural resources. I recently had the\r\nhonour to sign, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, thus\r\nenhancing its universality. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity and the relevant international bodies to spare\r\nno effort to make the Middle East and the Arab Gulf\r\nregion a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\r\nincluding nuclear weapons. The international community\r\nmust call on Israel to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to comply with the\r\ninternational safeguards regime of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nDespite the efforts and good offices of the League of\r\nArab States and the United Nations to save Somalia from\r\nits predicament, the civil war there continues unabated,\r\nand the deteriorating humanitarian situation is cause for\r\ngrave concern. We therefore appeal to the rival Somali\r\nfaction leaders to shoulder their responsibility and bring\r\nthis tragic bloodshed to an end. They must set aside their\r\ndifferences and form a national Government representing\r\nall the factions of the Somali people, a Government that\r\ncan restore to Somalia its national unity, territorial\r\nintegrity, security and stability.\r\nPolitical developments in the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina testify to the importance that the\r\ninternational community attaches to the Dayton Peace\r\nAgreement, with a view to restoring normal conditions in\r\nthe Republic. My country supported that Agreement. We\r\nconsider it the first constructive step on the road to a just\r\nand permanent settlement of the Balkan problem. We\r\nwelcome the results of the recent elections in the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia Herzegovina. We hope that these\r\nelections will safeguard the territorial integrity of the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nRepublic and contribute to the establishment of democratic\r\ninstitutions. We also hope that they will help restore normal\r\nrelations among the Bosnian people and pave the way for\r\nreconstruction, following the war’s devastation. Peace,\r\nsecurity and stability can then return to this tormented\r\nregion. We take this opportunity to stress the importance of\r\nbringing to justice war criminals who have committed\r\nheinous crimes against humanity and humanitarian\r\ninternational law in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe tragic events, raging wars and civil strife, and\r\nuntold human suffering of the peoples of some African\r\ncountries, are cause for grave concern. In view of the\r\nhistoric relations that bind our countries together, we\r\nreiterate our support for the efforts of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity in cooperation with the United Nations to\r\ncontain the conflicts by peaceful means so that their\r\npeoples’ aspirations to peace, security, stability and\r\ndevelopment may be realized.\r\nThe economic and social gap between the nations of\r\nthe world is still wide in spite of positive political and\r\neconomic developments on the regional and international\r\nscene, the creation of economic blocs, and free trade in the\r\nworld. This has led to the exacerbation of poverty, illiteracy\r\nand disease in many developing countries. Those countries\r\nare already ailing under the heavy burden of debt and debt-\r\nservicing, and are suffering from the deterioration of living\r\nstandards and dwindling development assistance from\r\ndeveloped countries, in addition to trade barriers adversely\r\naffecting their economies.\r\nThe world conferences held over the past five years\r\nachieved important results, and their recommendations have\r\nbecome important strategies aimed at creating an equitable\r\nand prosperous international environment. The international\r\ncommunity, which is still plagued by persistent violence,\r\norganized crime, drugs and terrorism, must translate these\r\nrecommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable\r\neconomic and social development and the free flow of trade\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries.\r\nWe firmly believe that this Organization still\r\nrepresents mankind’s conscience in the face of lingering\r\nworld problems. To enhance its role under the Charter, the\r\ninternational community needs to provide the necessary\r\npolitical, financial and moral support to the Organization.\r\nWe must undertake major structural reforms, enlarge the\r\nSecurity Council membership in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographic distribution, and improve\r\nthe functioning of the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the specialized agencies, so that they\r\ncan respond adequately to current regional and\r\ninternational developments.\r\nI would also like to stress the importance of\r\ncooperation, consultation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. These\r\norganizations can assist the United Nations to arrive at a\r\nbetter understanding of regional problems that can affect\r\npeace, security and sustainable development.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that our aspirations will find\r\nproper expression in the commitment by the States of the\r\nworld to the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of international law. We look forward to the\r\nrealization of the noble objectives of this Organization.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is His Excellency\r\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire and former President of the General Assembly,\r\non whom I now call.\r\nMr. Essy (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): My delegation and I are pleased, Sir, to see you\r\npresiding over the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your great experience of multilateral\r\ndiplomacy, along with the apt initiatives which your great\r\ncountry, Malaysia, and you yourself have taken in many\r\nfocal areas of international relations make you the right\r\nperson to guide us and to ensure the success of this\r\nimportant session.\r\nI extend my sincere congratulations to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for\r\nthe outstanding work he did in heading the General\r\nAssembly at a difficult time, marked by a financial crisis\r\nunprecedented in the history of our Organization. Thanks\r\nto his abilities and diplomacy, he helped to preserve the\r\nfounding roles of this institution, namely the maintenance\r\nof peace and of economic and social development, and to\r\nguide it towards new areas. We are particularly grateful\r\nto him for his excellent work at the last session, which\r\nmarked the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization.\r\nThe delegation of Côte d’Ivoire would also like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the active and\r\ndetermined part that he has always played in heading the\r\nSecretariat, particularly in the areas of peacekeeping and\r\neconomic and social development. Accordingly, the Côte\r\nd’Ivoire endorses the Declaration of African Heads of\r\nState or Government, who, at the thirty-second Summit of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, held at Yaoundé,\r\nreaffirmed Africa’s right to a second term and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nrecommended the candidature of Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali.\r\nNearly a year ago, on 22 October 1995, a Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting of the General Assembly took\r\nplace, involving 129 Heads of State or Government who\r\nhad come here solemnly to reconfirm their belief in the\r\nideals of the Charter of the United Nations, namely peace,\r\ndevelopment, international cooperation, equality and justice,\r\nand also to demonstrate their commitment to the reform and\r\nmodernization of our Organization so that it can take up the\r\nchallenges of the future. In the Declaration on the Occasion\r\nof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, adopted\r\non 24 October last, we committed ourselves to assuring that\r\nwe:\r\n“will give to the twenty-first century a United Nations\r\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively\r\nthe peoples in whose name it was established.”\r\n(resolution 50/6)\r\nEncouraged by Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral\r\nover the past year, the General Assembly and the\r\nSecretariat have advanced on the path of reform for the\r\nUnited Nations and clarification of its objectives and\r\nmissions. The open-ended working groups of the General\r\nAssembly responsible for examining “An Agenda for\r\nPeace”, the Agenda for Development, Security Council\r\nreform, the financial situation of the United Nations, and\r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system, have\r\nsufficiently progressed in their considerations to allow the\r\ngreatest hopes as to the restructuring of our Organization,\r\nits revitalization with an eye to greater effectiveness\r\nadapted to contemporary needs and challenges.\r\nI would add that after a decade of study and reflection\r\non United Nations reform, it is now imperative to proceed\r\nwith such reform so that we can focus on what constitutes\r\nthe raison d’être of our Organization: its essential missions,\r\nnamely, the maintenance of peace and security, the\r\npromotion of economic and social development, the\r\nstruggle against poverty, humanitarian assistance, the\r\nprotection of human rights and democracy, the protection\r\nof the environment, dialogue among cultures and respect for\r\ndiversity.\r\nConcomitant with this progress by Member State\r\ntowards reform, there has been an equally commendable\r\neffort by the Secretariat to correct the Organization’s\r\ndisfunctions, particularly those relating to fragmentation\r\nwithin the United Nations system and the inadequacy of\r\ncertain coordinating mechanisms, as well as, in some cases,\r\nthe absence of a rational division of labour, which has led\r\nto overlapping and duplication.\r\nI would particularly like to mention, among other\r\nthings, the progress that has been made towards the\r\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in\r\nthe economic, social and related fields pursuant to\r\nresolution 50/227. On the basis of that resolution, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council will carry out its work\r\nwithin a rationalized framework that should enable it to\r\nattain the objectives assigned to it under the Charter. Its\r\nworking methods will also be adapted to the necessity of\r\nbetter time management and greater budgetary savings,\r\noperating on the basis of a rational reduction in the many\r\noutputs of this body, with a view to assuring greater\r\neffectiveness. Thanks to this resolution, we should be able\r\nslowly to move away from the heavy and spendthrift\r\nbureaucracy associated with our Organization.\r\nIt is in this spirit that, in anticipation, the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) was able to\r\nreform its working methods, redeploy its people in the\r\nfield and develop its activities thanks to a fruitful\r\npartnership within and beyond the United Nations system,\r\nnotably with representatives of civil society. This truly\r\nremarkable transformation of UNDP over the past two\r\nyears has enabled it to regain a central role in operational\r\nactivities for development on all continents, particularly\r\nin Africa, where it is steering the United Nations System-\r\nwide Special Initiative for Africa.\r\nReform is an act of the will that plays itself out over\r\ntime. It must be carried out from the inside and under the\r\nimpetus of Member States. In this regard, we may\r\nwelcome the evaluation of the Efficiency Board chaired\r\nby Under-Secretary-General Joseph Connor, whose work\r\nis highly encouraging as to the rational management of\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nThus, all the sectors where overlapping and\r\nduplication were most obvious have now been singled out\r\nwith a view to proper management that will generate\r\nsubstantial economies in the budgetary performance of the\r\nSecretariat. Here we would like to say how pleased we\r\nare that the Secretary-General was able to hold the United\r\nNations budget for 1996-1997 within the strict limits\r\ndefined by the General Assembly. The $150 million in\r\nsavings are the result of a set of measures aimed at\r\nrationalizing and maximizing the cost-effectiveness ratio\r\nof the work of the Secretariat, as can be seen in the first\r\nreport of the United Nations Efficiency Board, which was\r\nmade public last month.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe new spirit of budgetary strictness and\r\nadministrative efficiency that is becoming prevalent within\r\nthe Secretariat and among those in charge of the agencies\r\nand programmes of the United Nations system seems to\r\nhave given us a new awareness of the need for self-\r\nexamination and for concrete responses to the needs of\r\nMember States.\r\nWith close links between thinking and operational\r\nactivities, and with an increasing presence on the ground,\r\nthe United Nations will be closer to the people, and thus\r\nbetter able to take into account their needs in a number of\r\nareas, such as employment, education, health, humanitarian\r\nassistance and environment.\r\nSpecifically on the question of humanitarian\r\nassistance, we should highlight the remarkable way in\r\nwhich the United Nations has adapted in dealing with the\r\nrefugee problems resulting from internal conflicts in various\r\nparts of the world. There are millions of displaced persons,\r\nand this situation is without precedent since 1945. The\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs, the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have been\r\nparticularly effective in this area.\r\nI think these examples are enough to rehabilitate the\r\nUnited Nations in the minds of some. If we were to believe\r\nits detractors, our Organization would be bureaucratic,\r\nbehind the times, ineffective and yet extravagant. While\r\nsome of these criticisms were perhaps justified to some\r\nextent in the past, today we can say that our Organization\r\nis moving resolutely towards reform and a structural and\r\nfunctional transformation that started a decade ago.\r\nLast year in San Francisco, 50 years after the founding\r\nof the United Nations, the international community\r\nreaffirmed at the highest level of leadership the relevance\r\nto today’s world of the Charter and its purposes and\r\nprinciples. Through this important act, the international\r\ncommunity enshrined its commitment to attaining the\r\nobjectives set out in the Charter. The Declaration of\r\n24 October 1995 also confirmed the essential tasks of the\r\nUnited Nations for the year 2000: promoting peace,\r\ndevelopment, equality, justice and understanding among\r\npeoples. It also gave a special place to the advancement of\r\nwomen and the protection of children.\r\nIn order to carry out these tasks, in the last few years\r\nMember States have worked out careful strategies through\r\nthe cycle, ending this year, of thematic conferences that\r\nbegan in New York in 1990 with the World Summit for\r\nChildren, continued in Rio with the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, in Vienna\r\nwith the World Conference on Human Rights, in Cairo\r\nwith the International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment, in Copenhagen with the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, in Beijing with the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women and in Istanbul with the Second\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements\r\n(Habitat II). In this connection, we should also emphasize\r\nthe importance of the upcoming World Food Summit, to\r\nbe held under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome in\r\nNovember 1996. Complementing these initiatives, the\r\nAgenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development\r\nprovide an appropriate framework for thinking about the\r\nimportant interrelationship and interaction between peace\r\nand development.\r\nAlong the same lines, and without being exhaustive\r\nin my list, I would like to recall the progress made last\r\nyear in the areas of peace and disarmament with the\r\nsigning on 24 September 1996 of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The establishment of new\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia, the South\r\nPacific and Africa, and measures relating to nuclear safety\r\nand security are also positive achievements in this area.\r\nIn conflict prevention, on the initiative of Canada\r\nand the Netherlands excellent progress has been made in\r\ndeveloping the rapid-reaction capability of the United\r\nNations to respond to threats to peace and security. Other\r\ninitiatives from various sources also bear witness to the\r\ngrowing concern over preventing conflicts and acting in\r\nadvance, particularly in the area of development, so as to\r\ncreate conditions for consolidating social peace in\r\nMember States.\r\nWith regard to human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, I would underline the specific, dynamic and\r\npublicly visible results of some recent United Nations\r\ndecisions, such as the establishment of a High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, the establishment and\r\neffective functioning of International Tribunals to\r\nprosecute and judge persons accused of serious violations\r\nof human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,\r\nand measures taken, or scheduled to be taken, in\r\ncombating terrorism and organized crime.\r\nFor these reasons, I think we can say that the United\r\nNations is now a much more coherent instrument vis-à-vis\r\nits objectives, its missions and its strategies. However, we\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nmust complete the renewal that is now under way. I have\r\nalready stressed that the Secretariat’s efforts to adapt,\r\ncarried out through austerity measures, are healthy, but the\r\ndividends should be used to strengthen operational activities\r\nfor development.\r\nThe other central organs — the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council —\r\nmust make continued, deeper-going transformations to\r\nupdate their structures, their functioning and their working\r\nmethods and adapt them to special circumstances that are\r\nunlike the post-world-conflict circumstances of 1945.\r\nIn this connection, and with particular regard to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I should say, as I did when I presided\r\nover the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, that\r\nthis body, within the context of the institutional balances\r\nprovided for in the Charter, should continue to play its full\r\npart in the reform process under way. The General\r\nAssembly, because of its unique form of legitimacy, is still\r\nthe best guarantor of the common interests of the Member\r\nStates.\r\nAs this fifty-first session begins, we find ourselves at\r\na crossroads. Last October we resoundingly reaffirmed the\r\nirreplaceable nature of the United Nations. Today, showing\r\npolitical will and above all a spirit of solidarity, we must\r\nnow translate that commitment into action. Without this\r\nreaffirmation of solidarity, the values on which the\r\ninternational community rests will become rather\r\nmeaningless. Our Organization must tirelessly continue to\r\nseek ways of strengthening this solidarity. We do not see it\r\nas much as we would like to, and the frustration of\r\ndeveloping countries is growing because of situations in\r\nwhich international cooperation targets are simply\r\ndisregarded and many promises remain unkept.\r\nIt is one thing to establish aid programmes and time-\r\nframes, but it is another to move ahead and actually do\r\nwhat the international community has committed itself to\r\ndo. Of course, the United Nations is often judged by\r\ninternational public opinion on the basis of its ability to\r\nconsolidate peace. But its credibility also depends on its\r\nability to act firmly in order to fill the increasingly wide\r\ngap between the rich and the developing countries.\r\nIt is high time that development aid found its place in\r\nan effort to mobilize, in which the actors, the industrialized\r\ncountries and the developing countries all get their fair\r\nshare. One cannot talk simultaneously about the existence\r\nof universal values, such as democracy or human rights,\r\nand still feel satisfied with a situation in which poverty and\r\nthe AIDS epidemic are steadily gaining ground, thus\r\nexacerbating the divisions within the international\r\ncommunity and thwarting national efforts.\r\nIn this context, the effort to combat AIDS must be\r\na subject of particular concern because of its devastating\r\nworld-wide effects, especially in developing countries,\r\nwhere 90 per cent of HIV-positive individuals are\r\nlocated — 60 per cent in Africa alone — but which do\r\nnot have the resources to deal with this pandemic. On the\r\nquestion of access to medicines, particularly anti-\r\nretrovirus agents, it seems unacceptable to us that such\r\npreventive medicines are available to only 10 per cent of\r\nthose suffering from AIDS/HIV.\r\nHowever, also within the context of international\r\ncooperation to combat AIDS, we welcome some strong\r\naction that has been taken. For example, we welcome the\r\nEconomic and Social Council resolution making the\r\nquestion of AIDS as one of the topics for its 1997 high-\r\nlevel segment. We would also place great hope in the\r\ncommitments made to provide the Secretariat with an\r\nappropriate structure and relevant resources to support the\r\nUnited Nations AIDS Programme.\r\nI would like to speak more about Africa, as many\r\nrepresentatives already have, because the picture painted\r\nis often very far from the reality. There is little in\r\ncommon between the usual cliches about the wretched\r\nsituation in Africa and the velvet revolution which our\r\ncountries are engaged in carrying out. We have suffered\r\nfrom the scourge of the economic crisis which has spared\r\nno continent. We have suffered from the globalization of\r\nthe economy, in which we have been marginalized. We in\r\nAfrica are now beginning to reverse this trend. All the\r\nspecialists agree that Africa has set forth on the path to\r\neconomic recovery, with an average growth rate last year\r\nof 5 per cent.\r\nFor my own country, Côte d’Ivoire, I can say that\r\nafter the l980s, which were marked by a difficult\r\neconomic and financial crisis, the Government adopted a\r\ncoherent economic policy, backed by thorough sectoral\r\nstrategies to obtain viable, strong, self-sustaining growth.\r\nStabilization and adjustment programmes begun in 1993\r\nenabled the Côte d’Ivoire to meet the conditions in 1994\r\nfor a recovery with greater diversification in our\r\neconomy, greater weight being given to the private sector\r\nand careful management of public finances, and a re-\r\ncentering of State control in the areas of regulation\r\nmonitoring and in the environment of economic activities.\r\nThis policy enabled us to achieve a 7-per-cent growth rate\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nin 1995, and suggests that we can achieve double-digit\r\ngrowth in 1998, which is the goal of President\r\nHenri Konan-Bédié, whose plan is to make Côte d’Ivoire a\r\ntruly industrialized nation.\r\nAlong with efforts to win the fight for development,\r\nAfrican countries have also committed themselves to\r\ndemocratization, as can be seen, inter alia, in the\r\norganization of multi-party elections, the establishment of\r\nthe rule of law and the emergence of a responsible civil\r\nsociety. Backed up by true legitimacy, political leaders are\r\nabout to succeed in building modern States with the\r\nprimary purpose of ensuring national cohesion and progress.\r\nThe advances that we see here and there on our\r\ncontinent must be backed up by more sustained action by\r\nthe industrialized countries. Time is running out, and we\r\nmust move quickly from speeches, promises and good\r\nintentions to concrete action. The adoption of the Agenda\r\nfor Development ought, therefore, to be an opportunity for\r\nre-thinking the philosophy underlying development\r\nassistance, its mechanisms and its modalities, so that socio-\r\neconomic activities can be placed at the centre of the work\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Assistant Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency Abdul-\r\nRahman Mansouri.\r\nMr. Mansouri (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): It gives me pleasure, as we begin the work of this\r\nsession, to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation\r\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, our sincerest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. Your\r\nassumption of that important position reflects the\r\nappreciation of Member States both of your personal\r\nqualities and of the positive role your country plays in the\r\ninternational arena. We wish you success in fulfilling your\r\nmission and assure you of our readiness and desire to\r\ncooperate with you fully in achieving the objectives of this\r\nsession.\r\nI wish also to take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his\r\neffective guidance of the affairs of the General Assembly\r\nlast session, which witnessed the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of our Organization.\r\nI would also like to convey my sincere appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, who manages the affairs of this international\r\nOrganization with exceptional ability and competence in\r\na rapidly changing world. In order to deal with increasing\r\nexpectations regarding the present and future role of the\r\nUnited Nations, we consider that a renewal of his tenure\r\nwill provide him the opportunity to complete ongoing\r\nplans and efforts to reform the United Nations and to\r\nrestore its constructive role in the international arena.\r\nA year has passed since we celebrated the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations. That celebration,\r\nattended by many world leaders, gave us a valuable\r\nopportunity to recall the importance of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and in enhancing international legitimacy. It also\r\nprovided us with an opportunity to review the\r\nOrganization’s accomplishments and challenges over the\r\npast 50 years.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly marks\r\nthe beginning of a new era for the United Nations, which\r\nwe hope will witness a consolidation of its role on the\r\ninternational scene to the benefit of Member States and in\r\naccordance with the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter. It is our firm belief that this international forum\r\ncan play an extremely important and effective role in\r\nmanaging crises, in averting wars and conflicts, and in\r\nproviding the means for international cooperation. This\r\nobliges us to be more persistent than ever before in\r\nsupporting this institution and enhancing its constructive\r\nrole.\r\nThe changes which have occurred in the world over\r\nthe past decade are so dramatic that they have created a\r\nnew international reality with a host of new challenges.\r\nThese developments offer new opportunities to bolster the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations for the benefit of\r\nstrengthening international legitimacy including justice\r\nand equality among nations, the rejection of the use of\r\nforce in the settlement of conflicts, the preservation of the\r\ndignity of mankind, and providing security and prosperity\r\nfor all. We should also recall the fact, to which many\r\nworld leaders referred during the fiftieth anniversary\r\ncelebrations, that the ability of this international\r\nOrganization to resolve global problems, crises and\r\nconflicts depends greatly on the political will of Member\r\nStates to abide by the principles of the United Nations. It\r\nis our hope that the future will witness greater\r\ndetermination by Member States to ensure the\r\nachievement of the objectives upon which the future of\r\nour Organization depends, a future which is also ours.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is fully cognizant of the\r\nimportance of reforming United Nations bodies so that they\r\nmay fulfil their prescribed roles and deal effectively with\r\nthe global changes we have witnessed in recent years.\r\nAmong these bodies, the Security Council, as the principal\r\norgan directly concerned with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, remains the focus for\r\nreform. My country’s view was and remains that any\r\nchanges to the structure of the Security Council should be\r\ngeared towards enhancing its ability to accomplish its role\r\neffectively as stipulated in the Charter and to refrain from\r\nany action that would limit its effectiveness in fulfilling its\r\npurposes.\r\nArab leaders, at their summit meeting in Cairo last\r\nJune, expressed their firm commitment to continue the\r\npeace process which they regard as an irreversible strategic\r\ngoal. The Cairo meeting reaffirmed that the realization of\r\na just and comprehensive peace within the realm of\r\ninternational legitimacy presupposes a serious and\r\nunequivocal commitment by Israel to abide by the\r\nprinciples of the Madrid Peace Conference and Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978),\r\nas well as by the land-for-peace formula. The Arab leaders\r\nalso reaffirmed that any breach by Israel of these principles\r\nand agreed-upon commitments and agreements, or any\r\ndelay in their implementation, would result in a setback to\r\nthe peace process, with all its dangerous consequences.\r\nWe view with great concern the Israeli Government’s\r\nfailure to demonstrate a degree of seriousness and\r\ncommitment to the peace process comparable to that\r\ndemonstrated by the Arab States. Since assuming office, the\r\nGovernment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has\r\ncontinued to issue statements and undertake actions that do\r\nnot serve the cause of peace. In contrast to the Arab States’\r\ncommitment to the Madrid principles, to Security Council\r\nresolutions and to the land-for-peace formula, the\r\nstatements made by the Israeli Government indicate an\r\ninsistence on consolidating of its occupation of Arab lands;\r\nmaintaining its annexation of East Jerusalem; and delaying\r\nthe agreed-upon redeployment of its troops from Al-Khalil.\r\nWe are also concerned by the Israeli Government’s\r\ncontinued closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,\r\ntogether with its proclaimed rejection of withdrawing from\r\nthe Syrian Golan Heights. Recently, the Israeli authorities\r\nopened a tunnel under the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This was a\r\nflagrant infringement upon the Islamic sanctuaries and a\r\nclear violation of binding international resolutions on the\r\nstatus of Jerusalem. We welcome Security Council\r\nresolution 1073 (1996), which the Council issued after the\r\nevents that resulted from the Israeli measures. We hope that\r\nthe summit conference sponsored by the President of the\r\nUnited States of America will help with the\r\nimplementation of that Security Council resolution and\r\ngive momentum to the peace process on the basis of that\r\nresolution and in accordance with its principles.\r\nStatements by the Israeli Prime Minister that Israel\r\nis prepared to resume negotiations without preconditions\r\nare no more than an attempt to distance himself from the\r\nMadrid-based principles and fundamentals of the peace\r\nprocess, in particular the land-for-peace formula. Such a\r\nposition can only mark a serious setback. Hence, we call\r\nupon the United States of America and the Russian\r\nFederation, as the co-sponsors of the Madrid Peace\r\nConference, to do their utmost to continue the peace\r\nprocess on all tracks in order to reach the desired results.\r\nIn this context we value the positive and constructive\r\npositions on this matter reflected in the Florence\r\nstatement of the European Union and the Lyon statement\r\nof the Group of Seven. Furthermore, we reiterate our call\r\nto all parties concerned to fulfil their commitments to\r\nprovide economic assistance to the Palestinian people.\r\nWhile we call upon members of the international\r\ncommunity to increase their economic assistance to the\r\nPalestinian Authority, we should remember the need to\r\ndeal with actions undertaken by the Israeli Government\r\nwhich might prevent the Palestinians from benefiting from\r\nthis aid. Moreover, any efforts to achieve regional\r\ncooperation will be meaningless and ineffective unless\r\naccompanied by tangible progress in the peace process on\r\nall its tracks.\r\nWe are greatly concerned about the issue of\r\nJerusalem — Al-Quds Al-Sharif — which is at the heart\r\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict and is of utmost concern to\r\nthe Arab and Muslim world. The manner in which this\r\nissue is dealt with could determine the future of the peace\r\nprocess. We regret to see the Israeli authorities continue\r\ntheir measures aimed at changing the demographic\r\ncomposition and creating new realities in the status of\r\nJerusalem with the intention of prejudicing the\r\nnegotiations on the final status of the city. We believe\r\nthat in any settlement of this issue Israel must take into\r\nconsideration internationally binding resolutions legality,\r\nin particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\r\nwhich calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied Arab\r\nterri tories, and 252 (1968) pertaining to\r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif. We also believe that any settlement\r\nshould take into account the importance of the repatriation\r\nof Palestinian refugees and the release of Palestinian\r\nprisoners who have been detained in violation of the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nDeclaration of Principles, international law and the Geneva\r\nConventions.\r\nThe honourable and firm stand taken by the\r\ninternational community following the brutal Iraqi\r\naggression against the State of Kuwait in 1990, including\r\nthe adoption of a series of historic Security Council\r\nresolutions to repel the aggression and restore to the State\r\nof Kuwait its legitimacy and sovereignty, constitutes the\r\nkind of firmness we hope the United Nations will always\r\ndemonstrate. The position of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\r\non this issue is unwavering, and is based on two\r\nfundamental principles. So long as the Iraqi Government\r\nhas not fully complied with the internationally binding\r\ndemands set out in Council resolutions, the problem will\r\nnot be solved and the suffering of the Iraqi people will not\r\nbe mitigated. This is a matter of deep concern for all of us.\r\nWe believe that recent developments in northern Iraq\r\ncould have adverse effects on the unity, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, since certain neighbouring\r\ncountries have in various ways attempted to interfere in the\r\nKurdish conflict. In the light of these realities, we have to\r\nbe very careful lest the situation lead to a collapse of the\r\ninternational coalition which is responsible for full\r\nimplementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions,\r\nthe foremost of which relate to the release and repatriation\r\nof all prisoners of war and detainees from Kuwait and other\r\ncountries, the return of stolen assets, compliance with the\r\nmechanism for compensation, and full cooperation with the\r\nefforts of the United Nations Special Commission to\r\noversee the elimination of Iraq’s weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. These are the objectives the international\r\ncoalition should strive to fulfil, bearing in mind the need to\r\navoid any measures that might damage the unity,\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.\r\nMr. Agathocleous (Cyprus), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy\r\nMosques expressed great interest in efforts to eliminate all\r\nweapons of mass destruction from the Middle East,\r\nincluding those aimed at keeping that sensitive part of the\r\nworld free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. In\r\nthis perspective, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia actively\r\nparticipated in the Review and Extension Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) held in New York last year, and welcomed\r\nthe efforts that have led to an agreement on the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe believe in the need to make the NPT more\r\neffective and universal through the activation of the\r\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency. We also see a need to adopt measures and\r\ncriteria that would enhance all aspects of the process of\r\ndismantling weapons of mass destruction in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 1 (I), which addresses,\r\ninter alia, the issue of eliminating all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. In this respect, we urge all States that have\r\nnot yet become parties to the Treaty to take the necessary\r\nsteps to do so, thus contributing to the maintenance of\r\nworld peace and stability.\r\nThe occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of\r\nthree islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates —\r\nAbu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb — is a source\r\nof great concern, not only to the United Arab Emirates,\r\nbut also to the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\n(GCC) as a whole, which desire the best possible\r\nrelations with their neighbour, Iran. We have repeatedly\r\nurged the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to the call\r\nof the United Arab Emirates to settle this long-standing\r\nproblem peacefully through serious bilateral negotiations.\r\nConsequently, we reiterate our call upon the Government\r\nof Iran to cease imposing a status quo by force and to\r\nhalt preparations for unilateral construction on any of the\r\nthree islands. Furthermore, we also call upon the\r\nGovernment of Iran to initiate efforts to resolve this\r\ndispute peacefully in accordance with the norms and\r\nprinciples of international law, including the referral of\r\nthis matter to the International Court of Justice. In view\r\nof the persistence of the conflict, the Security Council\r\nshould place this issue on its agenda.\r\nBased on the determination of the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia to maintain the security and stability of the\r\nArabian Gulf region, we support the wise actions of the\r\nState of Bahrain to foster its security and stability. These\r\nactions were approved and supported by the GCC and the\r\nLeague of Arab States, since the security of the State of\r\nBahrain is part and parcel of the security of the\r\nGCC States.\r\nNearly 10 months have passed since the signing of\r\nthe Dayton Agreement, which brought an end to the\r\nviolence and destruction that accompanied the Serb\r\naggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. This\r\nAgreement did not materialize until the international\r\ncommunity expressed sufficient will and firmness to stem\r\nthe Serb aggression. We hope that the recent elections\r\nwill mark a new beginning and a new future of peace,\r\nstability and economic development for the country.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nNonetheless, we must point out that the peace in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina will remain fragile until it takes root. The\r\nreconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the\r\ninternational support necessary to help it address the\r\nproblems resulting from years of war should be viewed as\r\nconditions of peace without which the goals of the Dayton\r\nAgreement can never be realized. It is also important to\r\nemphasize the need to apprehend and bring to justice the\r\nperpetrators of crimes against humanity and to ban them\r\nfrom any political office in the future. Their apprehension\r\nis an international responsibility that should not be taken\r\nlightly. It is also incumbent upon the international\r\ncommunity to confront any attempt to divide the country\r\nalong ethnic or religious lines.\r\nHelping Bosnia and Herzegovina set out on the road\r\nto peace early this year was the first of a series of positive\r\ndevelopments in many troubled areas of the world. We\r\nhope that the recent announcement of an agreement\r\nbetween the Government of the Philippines and the Moro\r\nNational Liberation Front will mark the end of\r\nconfrontation between the Philippine authorities and their\r\nMuslim minority after a long period of tension and conflict.\r\nAs for the conflict in Chechnya, we hope the current\r\ntruce and reports of the Russian Government’s intention to\r\nwithdraw its forces from the area will pave the way for a\r\nresolution of this crisis.\r\nUnfortunately, the statuses of other conflicts have not\r\nchanged. The Pakistani-Indian dispute over Jammu and\r\nKashmir is still tense and complicated. There is no\r\nalternative to following the peaceful path based on the\r\nresolutions of the United Nations guaranteeing the people\r\nof Jammu and Kashmir the exercise of their right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nThe situation in Somalia remains desperate. The\r\ncountry is awaiting a decision by the clan leaders on a\r\nprocess to save the country and its people. We urge all\r\nfactions to put aside their differences and shoulder their\r\nnational responsibilities by forming a national authority\r\nrepresenting the different factions of the Somali people in\r\norder to restore unity, stability and security to that country.\r\nIn Afghanistan — in spite of all the sincere efforts of\r\nthe United Nations and all the good offices of the\r\nGovernment of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to\r\nachieve national reconciliation in that country — the\r\nfighting still rages between the different factions as a result\r\nof disagreements between their leaders. This has prevented\r\nthe country from enjoying the fruits of its victory against\r\nforeign occupation.\r\nThe issue of international terrorism was the main\r\ntopic throughout last year. Many conferences and\r\nworkshops addressed ways and means of confronting this\r\ngrowing phenomenon, which has become a source of\r\ngrave concern for the international community. The\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, recognizing the need to\r\nconfront and address this serious phenomenon, has voiced\r\nits support for all international efforts to confront this\r\nproblem. This position was illustrated collectively in the\r\nstatement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\nfollowing its last session. The GCC States have\r\nemphasized that extremism, violence and terrorism are\r\nglobal phenomena that are not limited to a specific people\r\nor region and have unambiguously denounced and\r\ncondemned all forms of violence and terrorism. They also\r\nexpressed their support for all international efforts aimed\r\nat preventing and combating terrorism, including denying\r\nsafe haven to terrorists anywhere and making efforts to\r\napprehend, convict and severely punish those involved in\r\nsuch crimes.\r\nA cursory review of world economic problems and\r\nthe role of the United Nations in overseeing international\r\neconomic cooperation shows that the success of the\r\nUnited Nations in dealing with economic issues and\r\npromoting international development has also been tied to\r\nthe commitment of Member States to the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nAlthough the international community has succeeded,\r\nby dint of serious negotiations, in resolving many difficult\r\nproblems and has achieved important results in many\r\nsensitive areas through the establishment of the World\r\nTrade Organization, we are still concerned by the\r\ncontinuing practice of trade protectionism, which runs\r\ncounter to our belief in the importance of allowing market\r\nforces to play their natural role in economic affairs. It is\r\nalso necessary to free international trade from certain\r\nrestrictions, such as that of using the pretext of protecting\r\nthe environment as a justification for protectionist\r\nmeasures. Such restrictions undermine the economies of\r\ndeveloping nations and have a negative impact on their\r\ndevelopment, which is the cornerstone of their peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThe Secretary-General has taken a commendable\r\ninitiative in this direction with his “An Agenda for\r\nDevelopment”, which, given concerted effort, could\r\nbecome a realistic tool for enhancing global economic and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nsocial development. Here, the developed countries in\r\nparticular bear a special responsibility for building fruitful\r\ncooperation to the benefit all countries, rich and poor. We\r\nbelieve that an increase in the amount of assistance\r\nprovided by developed to developing countries is a\r\ncornerstone of such hoped-for cooperation.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a founding Member of\r\nthe international Organization and a signatory of the San\r\nFrancisco Charter, is eager to have the United Nations\r\ncontinue to play its leadership role in strengthening\r\ncollective security. It reaffirms its responsibilities as a\r\nfounding Member of the Organization. This reaffirmation\r\nwas reiterated in a speech by the Custodian of the Two\r\nHoly Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz, which was\r\ndelivered on his behalf by His Royal Highness Prince\r\nSultan Bin Abdul-Aziz, Second Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Defence and Aviation, on the occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Today, the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia takes this opportunity to\r\nreconfirm its continued commitment to achieving the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter. It will spare no\r\neffort to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations in\r\norder to achieve justice and to promote security, stability\r\nand prosperity throughout our troubled world.\r\nThe Holy Koran provides us with guidance to lead us\r\ntowards creative actions, as exemplified in the following\r\nverse:\r\n“And say: Work righteousness.\r\nSoon will God observe your work,\r\nAnd His Apostle, and the Believers.\u0027”\r\n(The Holy Koran, IX:105)\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mauritania,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Lemrabott Sidi Mahmoud Ould Cheikh\r\nAhmed.\r\nMr. Lemrabott (Mauritania)(interpretation from\r\nArabic): I should like to convey to the President, on behalf\r\nof my delegation, my warm congratulations on his election\r\nto the presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are convinced that his personal qualities,\r\nexperience and great skill are our best guarantee for the\r\nsuccess of this session and will enable us to achieve\r\npositive results.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour gratitude and esteem to Mr. Freitas do Amaral,\r\nPresident of the fiftieth session, who so ably guided the\r\nwork of the Assembly last year.\r\nI should also like once again to extend our entire\r\nconfidence to our brother, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and\r\nto express to him our thanks for the great efforts he has\r\ntirelessly expended since shouldering his heavy\r\nresponsibilities in strengthening the universality and\r\ncredibility of the United Nations and enhancing its\r\ncapacity to play its rightful role, notwithstanding\r\nparticularly difficult international circumstances.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that, as the Organization\r\nenters into its second 50 years of life, substantial progress\r\nis being made on the road to peace throughout the world.\r\nThus, East-West confrontation, more commonly\r\nknown as the cold war, has ended and the spectre of the\r\nbalance of terror has disappeared, giving way to dialogue\r\nand cooperation in the establishment and maintenance of\r\nworld peace and security. Other important steps have also\r\nbeen taken towards decolonization, the eradication of\r\nracial discrimination and the full exercise by peoples of\r\ntheir right to self-determination.\r\nWe must, however, note that these achievements,\r\nvaluable as they are, have not contributed significantly to\r\nimproving the situation in many parts of the world where,\r\nin some countries, there are still hotbeds of tension and\r\nbloody wars. Nor have they sufficed to eliminate the\r\npoverty and underdevelopment that are still the daily lot\r\nof a large proportion of the inhabitants of our planet.\r\nThus, developing countries continue to suffer the\r\ncombined effects of the world economic crisis and the\r\nongoing deterioration of terms of trade and to bear the\r\nburden of an external debt that exhausts their resources at\r\nthe very time that official development assistance is\r\nconstantly decreasing.\r\nThe past year has seen no important improvement in\r\nthe world economic situation. That conclusion is\r\nunavoidable, since the current economic crisis has as its\r\nbasis the inequity inherent in the world economy, an\r\ninequity whose major consequences are macroeconomic\r\nimbalance, unfair terms of trade and inequality in the\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\nIn this framework, the African continent is obviously\r\nthe hardest hit by the negative effects of the deterioration\r\nin economic conditions owing to the burden of its\r\nexternal debt and the fall in the prices of the raw\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nmaterials that make up the principal source of income for\r\nmost African countries.\r\nThe Sahel region is among those on our continent that\r\nis suffering the most from this situation, especially given\r\nthe chronic drought from which it has suffered for over\r\nthree decades and that has weakened and sometimes\r\ndestroyed the economies of its component countries.\r\nHowever, we are gratified by the increased interest\r\nshown in recent years with regard to African development\r\nand we welcome the System-wide Special Initiative for\r\nAfrica launched by the Secretary-General, which we would\r\nlike to see implemented as soon as possible.\r\nThe consolidation of democracy and the construction\r\nof a State based on the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights are positive results of the activities of the\r\ninternational community, as reflected in the resolutions of\r\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as\r\nin the decisions and recommendations handed down by\r\nseveral conferences organized under United Nations\r\nauspices or with its support. This confirms the importance\r\nof the collective effort of the United Nations and should\r\nencourage the Organization to continue its pursuit of the\r\nnoble objectives of mankind.\r\nIn that connection, and in order to enable the United\r\nNations to strengthen such action, it is particularly urgent\r\nand essential to work on the restructuring of its organs, the\r\nrationalization of its working methods and the improvement\r\nin its performance.\r\nTo that end, my country supports the proposals\r\ndesigned to give renewed dynamism to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, to end duplication in its subsidiary bodies\r\nand to improve its rules of operation. We also support\r\nproposals aimed at enlarging representation in the Security\r\nCouncil in keeping with the requirements of democracy,\r\ntransparency and equity.\r\nWe also believe that the principle of equality among\r\nMember States should be the basis for any action\r\nundertaken to restructure the Security Council, which,\r\naccording to Article 24 of the United Nations Charter, acts\r\non behalf of all Member States. This means that the\r\nCouncil has an obligation to reflect the universal character\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAllow me to say a word about the democratic process\r\nin Mauritania, the first phase of which began 10 years ago\r\nin 1986 with the first local elections and was followed by\r\nthe adoption of the 1991 Constitution. Pluralistic, multi-\r\nparty presidential and parliamentary elections followed in\r\n1992 and the second round of local elections in 1994.\r\nThis process is being strengthened once again by the\r\nholding on 11 October of the second round of legislative\r\nelections in a free and transparent climate. Two hundred\r\nand sixty-nine candidates, most from 13 political parties,\r\nwill appeal to the voters for the 79 seats of the National\r\nAssembly. All provisions have been made to ensure that\r\nthis election takes place under the best conditions.\r\nWith this new achievement, the Mauritanian people\r\nwill confirm that it has become, as stated by His\r\nExcellency President Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya,\r\n“the source of sovereignty and legality” and the master of\r\nits own destiny and affairs.\r\nHaving won the struggle for democracy and\r\nachieved the institution of the rule of law and the\r\nguarantee of all individual and collective rights,\r\nMauritania is engaged in another, equally determined\r\nstruggle against economic and social underdevelopment.\r\nIn this regard, many economic reform programmes have\r\nbeen implemented since 1985 within the framework of a\r\nliberal policy incorporating all development dimensions\r\nand designed to raise the living standards of citizens and\r\nmaking basic services available to them.\r\nThese reforms have allowed us to reinvigorate public\r\nfinances, overcome inflation and restore continued\r\ngrowth. Many projects have also been carried out in the\r\nareas of communications, transportation infrastructure,\r\nvillage electrification, expanded water-supply networks\r\nand increased health-care coverage. Let me express our\r\nappreciation to all of the brotherly and friendly countries,\r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations that have\r\nsupported my country’s efforts towards these goals and\r\nthank them for the aid they have provided and continue\r\nto provide.\r\nStrengthening democracy and economic and social\r\ndevelopment requires the consolidation of peace and\r\nsecurity both for States and individuals. We must\r\ntherefore note the striking paradox, despite the end of the\r\ncold war and new hopes for peace and justice, of the\r\nre-emergence of terrorism, instability and the proliferation\r\nof hotbeds of tension around the world.\r\nThe Middle East is one region where, unfortunately,\r\nthis paradox is most alarming. My country, renewing its\r\nfull support for the peace process, remains convinced that\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\n425 (1978) and the principle of “land for peace”, adopted\r\nat the Madrid Conference, remain the bases for any\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in that region.\r\nWe also believe that there can be no real solution to\r\nthe Middle East problem as long as Israel has not\r\nwithdrawn from all the occupied Palestinian territories,\r\nincluding the Holy Arab City of Al-Quds, the Golan and\r\nsouthern Lebanon.\r\nWe had therefore welcomed the new era that seemed\r\nto have emerged with the signing on 13 September 1993 of\r\nthe Declaration of Principles on the autonomy of Gaza and\r\nJericho and other positive advances that followed,\r\nespecially the 1994 Cairo agreement, the peace Agreement\r\nbetween Israel and Jordan, and the Taba Agreement on the\r\nimplementation of the second phase of the Declaration of\r\nPrinciples, signed in Washington on 28 September 1995.\r\nWe had hoped that the Palestinian people will soon see the\r\nend of its tragedy by recovering its legitimate right to self-\r\ndetermination and to establish its independent State on its\r\nterritory.\r\nOn this basis, and in order to ensure the continuation\r\nof the peace process, the concluded Agreements must be\r\nimplemented and commitments undertaken must be\r\nhonoured. Negotiations must resume among all the\r\nconcerned parties on the basis of the principles arrived at\r\nand accepted by all and in accordance with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. My country also insists on the\r\nneed to lift the embargo imposed on the brotherly\r\nPalestinian people, the devastating consequences of which\r\non the fledgling Palestinian economy and the repercussions\r\nof which on security in the Palestinian territories could\r\nendanger the peace process.\r\nFinally, we invite the two sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess to assume fully their responsibilities in order to\r\nallow the people of the region to recover their legitimate\r\nrights and to open a new chapter in the history of this\r\nsubregion, so that its potential can be put to the service of\r\neconomic development and social advancement.\r\nNearby, the aftermath of the Gulf War continues to\r\nraise obstacles to the normalization of the situation in that\r\nregion. In this regard, my country has always affirmed and\r\nwishes to reaffirm today its dedication to respect for\r\ninternational legality and the United Nations resolutions\r\npertaining to the Gulf War and its consequences. We\r\nreiterate our rejection of any threat to the independence of\r\nKuwait and its territorial integrity and we call for the\r\nsettlement of the question of Kuwaiti prisoners.\r\nWe also reaffirm our consistent position of rejecting\r\nany action threatening the unity of fraternal Iraq and the\r\nintegrity of its territory. We call for the lifting of the\r\nembargo imposed on the Iraqi people, which is subjecting\r\nthem to famine and disease. In this regard, my country\r\nwishes to see implemented, as soon as possible, Security\r\nCouncil resolution 986 (1995) on the issue of oil for food.\r\nWe also wish to express our rejection of the plan being\r\nentertained by some of Iraq’s neighbours to create a safe\r\narea in northern Iraq, in contradiction to their declared\r\ndedication to territorial integrity and unity and in violation\r\nof the principles and rules of international law and the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nMy country believes that the United Arab Emirates\r\nhas the inalienable right to recover its full and complete\r\nsovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb\r\nand Lesser Tunb. We reiterate our support for the United\r\nArab Emirates in its endeavours to recover its rights by\r\nall available means.\r\nIn the Arab Maghreb, the question of Western\r\nSahara is a consistent source of great concern because of\r\nits threat to stability and security in the subregion. My\r\ncountry also believes that the United Nations, and the\r\nSecurity Council in particular, should, now more than\r\never, assume its full responsibility for the implementation\r\nof the settlement plan, in keeping with resolutions adopted\r\nto that end on the holding of a free and impartial\r\nreferendum that will make it possible to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive and definitive solution to the question of\r\nWestern Sahara and to ensure security and stability in the\r\nregion. For our part, we continue to be prepared to\r\ncontribute positively to the achievement of that aim.\r\nWith regard to the embargo that for several years\r\nhas affected the Libyan people, my country wishes to see\r\ngreater receptivity to Libya’s obvious willingness to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations and other concerned\r\nparties, in seeking a solution to the crisis between it and\r\ncertain western countries. We call for the lifting of this\r\nembargo — which is hurting the Libyan people and all\r\nthe peoples of the Maghreb — and hope that the proposal\r\nof the League of Arab States, which enjoys broad support,\r\nwill open up new opportunities to put an end to it.\r\nWith regard to security and stability, Africa\r\ncontinues to face major problems. Conflicts are spreading\r\ndeath, famine and epidemic throughout the continent. In\r\nSomalia, the war continues to leave a train of death and\r\ndestruction and the international community, despite the\r\nsolidarity it has shown in the past through its\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\ninvolvement, no longer evinces much interest in a situation\r\nthat is threatening the Somali people. We hope the Somali\r\npeople will overcome their differences and find a way to\r\nconduct a constructive dialogue.\r\nIn Liberia, we hope that the peace process will\r\ncontinue, in keeping with the Abuja Agreement, and we\r\nreiterate our support for the decisions taken by the\r\nministerial ad hoc Committee of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) at its seventh session\r\nand the decisions and recommendations of the last two\r\nsummits of the Organization of African Unity and\r\nECOWAS on Liberia, so that peace and harmony may\r\nreturn to that fraternal country.\r\nWe hope that our Rwandan and Burundian brothers\r\nwill, in their countries, resolve their conflicts and seek\r\ndialogue and understanding in solving their problems. We\r\nalso hope that they will be able to face the challenges of\r\ndevelopment and devote to it the energies now being\r\ndevoted to their differences.\r\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, my country\r\nexpresses satisfaction at the important advances made along\r\nthe road to peace, especially the recent democratic\r\nelections. We reaffirm also the need to continue\r\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement and to see the\r\ninternational community exert the necessary effort for the\r\nreconstruction of that country, whose infrastructure has\r\nbeen destroyed and whose people have suffered the most\r\nhorrifying forms of aggression.\r\nThe United Nations must adapt to the world as it is\r\nand to the changes it undergoes. The Islamic Republic of\r\nMauritania wishes to reiterate its willingness and\r\ncommitment to work in concert with other Member States\r\ntowards the realization of the noble goals of our\r\nOrganization, in particular the consolidation of peace and\r\nsecurity in the world.\r\nAt a time when most third-world countries are facing\r\nenormous challenges that hamper their advance towards\r\ngreater progress and prosperity, and while our planet is\r\nfacing environmental challenges that threaten the future of\r\nall life on Earth, considerable resources are being devoted\r\nto the production, refinement and acquisition of weapons of\r\nmass destruction of all kinds, while official development\r\nassistance continues to decline.\r\nIn this respect we hope that the recent Treaty\r\nprohibiting nuclear tests will be one important step along\r\nthe way to complete and general disarmament, the only way\r\nto free up the necessary resources for the development of\r\nthe third world.\r\nToday, more than half a century after the creation of\r\nour Organization, we must be fully aware of our common\r\ndestiny. We must dedicate ourselves to promoting\r\nmutually advantageous international cooperation and\r\nbringing about effective solidarity equal to the challenges\r\nwe face to ensure a better future for all humankind.\r\nMy country, as in the past, will continue to work\r\ntowards the strengthening of friendly and brotherly\r\nrelations among all peoples and nations in the pursuit of\r\nthe noble ideals aspired to by the founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nForeign Trade of Jamaica, His Excellency Mr. Seymour\r\nMullings.\r\nMr. Mullings (Jamaica): May I, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Jamaica, convey to Mr. Razali Ismail our\r\nwarmest congratulations on his election as President of\r\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. In so\r\ndoing we pay tribute to his country, Malaysia, which is\r\nlinked to Jamaica by close ties of friendship and\r\ncollaboration and which continues to play a prominent\r\nrole in international affairs. I would assure him of the full\r\nsupport and cooperation of the Jamaican delegation in the\r\ndeliberations on the many important issues before us.\r\nI should like to congratulate your predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for the able\r\nmanner in which he guided the work of the fiftieth\r\nsession. Let me also express appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring\r\nefforts to promote peace and development.\r\nThere are many who, with good reason, approach\r\nthis fifty-first session with a sense of despair and deep\r\nconcern about the future of the United Nations and the\r\nvital mission that it must undertake on behalf of the\r\npeoples of the world. They look back at the promises and\r\nthe pledges made during the fiftieth anniversary\r\ncelebrations and try to reconcile these lofty messages with\r\nthe continuing crisis being faced by this body and the\r\ndifficulties confronting the multilateral system.\r\nRather than dwelling on the missed opportunities and\r\nthe difficulties that have confronted us, my delegation\r\nwould wish for this Assembly to recognize the imperative\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nneed for effective global action in the pursuit of the goals\r\nof international peace and security, economic and social\r\nwell-being, and justice for all. In so doing, we must all\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the principles on which the\r\nUnited Nations is based. Our Prime Minister, P. J.\r\nPatterson, and other world leaders joined in renewing the\r\ncollective commitment to these principles at last year’s\r\nSpecial Commemorative Meeting.\r\nThe fundamental goal of the United Nations is the\r\nachievement and preservation of international peace and\r\nsecurity. We have witnessed in recent times the end of the\r\ncold war and the dramatic reduction in East-West tensions.\r\nAt the same time, we have witnessed the tragic emergence\r\nof horrific levels of ethnic tension, regional instability and\r\nintra-State upheavals, which have threatened international\r\npeace and security. These have severely tested the mettle of\r\nthe United Nations system and the community of nations as\r\na whole.\r\nThe challenges to peacemakers and peacekeepers in\r\nthis period have been many. We must, today, recognize the\r\nsuccesses that have been achieved through combined\r\nmultilateral and regional action in the spirit of the Charter.\r\nA functioning multilateral system should work effectively\r\nto restrain aggression and the exercise of military power.\r\nWe must resist tendencies towards unilateralism which are\r\nunhealthy and negative signs for the international system.\r\nWe must insist that the established mechanisms for conflict\r\nresolution and decision-making in relation to issues of\r\nmultilateral security are upheld.\r\nJamaica and sister nations of the Caribbean joined the\r\ninternational community in mounting a United Nations\r\nMission in Haiti that brought an end to the wanton violence\r\nand the tragedies at sea that characterized the period of\r\nmilitary dictatorship in that country.\r\nThe return of democracy has brought renewed hope,\r\nopportunity and optimism to the people of Haiti. These\r\nsentiments can be sustained only if we continue to help the\r\nGovernment and people of Haiti to overcome the obstacles\r\nthat still confront them in this quest. It is important that the\r\nUnited Nations Support Mission in Haiti be given the\r\nmeans necessary to enable it to meet its objectives. It is\r\neven more critical that the international community commit\r\nitself to providing the technical and financial resources\r\nnecessary to assist Haiti to achieve economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe nations of the Caribbean seek to maintain a\r\nclimate free of tension and confrontation. We seek the\r\nnormalization of relations, which will reduce the\r\natmosphere of uncertainty and the dangers of\r\nconfrontation in the region. We seek this in an\r\natmosphere of respect for sovereign rights and a\r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. We\r\nreject the extra-territorial application of national\r\nlegislation, which is inconsistent with international law.\r\nWithin the wider Caribbean, we continue to pursue\r\nthe goal of regional integration through the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) and the Association of\r\nCaribbean States. It is our objective to achieve the\r\ncreation of a Caribbean zone of peace and cooperation.\r\nWe are united by a common determination to remove the\r\nbarriers that divide us and to protect the precious natural\r\nheritage that we share. For this we have to engage the\r\nactive participation of all countries in the region.\r\nWe wish to commend the efforts of African\r\nGovernments and the Organization of African Unity to\r\novercome the grave difficulties that Africa has been\r\nexperiencing. We particularly welcome the initiative for\r\na conference on peace, security and stability in the\r\nAfrican Great Lakes region. We can only hope that,\r\nthrough a comprehensive approach, lasting solutions can\r\nbe found to the situations in Burundi and Rwanda. We\r\nreiterate our strong support for the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to implement the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\nand the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica.\r\nWe are encouraged by recent events in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, which have paved the way for elections in\r\nthat country, and look forward to the restoration of\r\nstability and a harmonious relationship among its people.\r\nWe support the position that the Middle East peace\r\nprocess should be consolidated and proceed on the basis\r\nof the principles already agreed and accepted by all\r\nparties. There should be no turning back. Peace is\r\nattainable if the parties approach negotiations in a spirit\r\nof accommodation and compromise, and recognize their\r\ncommon interest in ensuring stability and mutual respect\r\nfor each other’s rights. We hope that the talks, which\r\nbegin today at the invitation of President Clinton, will\r\nlead to a speedy agreement among the parties.\r\nWhile the United Nations must focus critical\r\nattention on the crises caused by conflict and violent\r\nconfrontation, it must never lose sight of the root cause of\r\ninstability and tension — poverty, deprivation, hunger\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nand disease. It is in the depth of human misery that the\r\nswords of anger and division are most quickly unsheathed.\r\nA commitment to the goals of peace and security is\r\nmeaningless without a commitment to fostering sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development, and to\r\nwaging war on poverty and human misery.\r\nThe emerging global economic environment gives us\r\ncause for both optimism and grave anxiety. Phenomenal\r\neconomic growth in a few countries is contrasted with\r\ndecline and stagnation in the majority. An increasingly\r\naffluent world coexists with a huge and marginalized\r\nunderclass. This polarization is reflected both internally and\r\nexternally.\r\nA failure to address inequities can and will inevitably\r\nlead to what the 1996 Human Development Report so\r\ngraphically describes on page 8 as\r\n“a world gargantuan in its excesses and grotesque in\r\nits human and economic inequalities.”\r\nFor many low-income countries that lack adequate\r\naccess to development capital and other resources, official\r\ndevelopment assistance remains a critical but diminishing\r\nsource of support. Moreover, the problem of external debt\r\nis also a burden for many of these countries. Agreed\r\narrangements have proved inadequate in alleviating debt\r\nburdens, and alternate strategies still have to be found.\r\nIt is against this background that Jamaica continues to\r\ninsist that achieving sustained economic growth and\r\nsustainable development must remain a priority objective of\r\nthe global agenda. In the series of global conferences\r\nending recently with the Second United Nations Conference\r\non Human Settlements (Habitat II), Governments\r\ndemonstrated their ability to collaborate in analyzing socio-\r\neconomic and environmental problems.\r\nTaken together, these conferences represent deliberate\r\nefforts to define a framework for development cooperation\r\nand multilateral commitments. These global forums have\r\nraised the level of awareness of development issues. We\r\nshould now not allow inertia to take over. It is essential,\r\ntherefore, that we honour the commitments and meet the\r\ninternationally agreed targets emanating from these\r\nconferences. Their success depends on political will and the\r\nprovision of adequate resources to ensure follow-up and\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe 1997 special session devoted to the assessment\r\nand review of the implementation of Agenda 21 and the\r\nresults of the 1992 United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development in Rio will provide an\r\nideal opportunity for the international community to\r\nassess progress in carrying out the agreed commitments.\r\nFor small island developing countries, the review\r\nprocess is of great significance, and we hope it will\r\nprovide the momentum fully to implement the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nGovernments, including my own, have created their\r\nown framework for implementation at the national level.\r\nJamaica has embraced the concept of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, and our policies have been oriented towards\r\nachieving these goals.\r\nThe main challenge faced by small island developing\r\nStates is to find the resources to develop a programme\r\nthat is designed to reduce the vulnerability of their\r\neconomies and generate economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. This envisages a systematic approach to the\r\ncategorization of island developing countries by\r\nspecialization or socio-economic performance.\r\nThe Uruguay Round agreements, on which the\r\nWorld Trade Organization is founded, provide the\r\nframework for a liberalized multilateral trading system.\r\nMany developing countries are unlikely to benefit in\r\nthe short term from the Uruguay Round agreements.\r\nStructurally weak and vulnerable developing countries\r\nrequire favourable arrangements and equitable terms and\r\nconditions to enable them to make the necessary\r\nadjustments to participate successfully in world trade.\r\nFree trade must never be viewed as an end in itself;\r\nit must be a vehicle for development. It is for this reason\r\nthat the World Trade Organization recognizes the need for\r\nspecial and differential treatment for developing countries\r\nand waivers for special trading regimes. This must be\r\nrespected in both letter and spirit.\r\nWe are of the firm view that no action should be\r\ntaken to erode our vital interests or remove equitable and\r\nlong-standing arrangements that affect the very economic\r\nsurvival of some developing countries. In this context, I\r\nrefer to the current action by a coalition of powerful\r\nspecial interests with respect to the special terms enjoyed\r\nby a number of developing countries through their\r\narrangements with the European Union. It has been made\r\nabundantly clear that the removal of preferences would\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nhave a serious negative impact on the economies of\r\nJamaica and other Caribbean countries.\r\nMy delegation therefore calls upon those who would\r\nseek to use the World Trade Organization as an instrument\r\nto attack the very foundation of the economies of small\r\ndeveloping States to desist from this course of action. The\r\nthoughtless assault upon the Lomé Banana Protocol is of\r\ngreat concern to my country and to sister Caribbean banana\r\nproducers, which stand to suffer economic devastation if the\r\nselfish acts of these powerful interests are allowed to\r\nsucceed.\r\nThe trend towards globalization is irreversible, but not\r\nall of us are capable of making the adjustments necessary\r\nin the short term to cope with its consequences. The United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\r\nhas an important role to play in assisting developing\r\ncountries to meet the challenges brought about by\r\nglobalization and liberalization and to facilitate their\r\nintegration in the world trading system. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the renewed vigour of this body, as exemplified\r\nat the ninth session of UNCTAD, where Governments\r\nreaffirmed the relevance of UNCTAD’s mandate as the\r\nfocal point for dealing with trade and related development\r\nissues.\r\nIt is necessary to examine and assess the United\r\nNations system and its capacity to respond to political and\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. The United Nations must begin\r\nto link peace-keeping and peacemaking in a more coherent\r\nand consistent manner. We note the work in this regard\r\ntaking place in the Assembly’s Informal Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on an Agenda for Peace. We recognize the\r\nneed for a rapidly deployable unit and support the efforts to\r\nput this in place.\r\nAn important step was taken in the field of\r\ndisarmament recently with the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Jamaica\r\nregards the CTBT as an incremental step and looks forward\r\nto the next stage, which is the adoption of a programme to\r\nachieve the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament.\r\nThose States with nuclear capabilities have a responsibility\r\nto carry out their obligations in good faith not only in\r\nregard to nuclear testing, but also with respect to non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nThe problem of drug abuse and illicit traffic in\r\nnarcotics continues to pose a serious threat to society. The\r\nextent of drug abuse and drug trafficking shows that it\r\ntranscends national and geographic boundaries. National\r\ncommitment and international cooperation are therefore\r\nrequired to address this problem. It is against this\r\nbackground that Jamaica strongly supports the convening\r\nof a special session of the General Assembly in 1998 to\r\naddress the illicit trafficking in and use of drugs. At the\r\nsame time, we must recognize the impact of related\r\ncriminal activity, which is spawned by the illicit drug\r\ntrade. Of particular concern is the nexus between drug\r\ntrafficking and trafficking in arms and high-powered\r\nweapons. We urge those States that are producers of these\r\narms to be more vigilant in enforcing control over their\r\ndistribution and illegal export.\r\nSince we met last year, significant developments\r\nhave occurred with regard to the implementation of the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. With the completion\r\nof elections to the various institutions of the authority, the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority is now operational. We\r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Mr. Satya Nandan on his\r\nelection and express our confidence that his leadership\r\nand guidance will enable the Authority to discharge its\r\nmandate. It is vital that adequate resources be provided in\r\norder to ensure that the Authority becomes firmly\r\nestablished.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to welcome the\r\nhistoric election on 1 August of the members of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. We look\r\nforward to the inauguration of the Tribunal in its host city\r\nof Hamburg later this month. This will be another\r\nlandmark in the process of the implementation of the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nWe should note the tremendous achievements of the\r\nUnited Nations in the progressive development of\r\ninternational law. A significant number of instruments\r\nhave been concluded that provide the legal underpinnings\r\nof the multilateral system. It is a dynamic process which\r\nis helping to bring more order to international relations.\r\nThe creation of an international criminal court is among\r\nthe latest initiatives on which substantive work has been\r\ndone. Jamaican experts have participated actively in the\r\nprogressive development of international law. We are\r\nready to contribute further to the machinery of the\r\ninternational legal system.\r\nTo respond to a multitude of challenges, the United\r\nNations needs to be renewed and revitalized. There is a\r\nstrongly shared perception that we must proceed\r\nexpeditiously with the task of bringing about the much-\r\nneeded reform of the United Nations system in the\r\ncollective interest. The initiative to restructure and\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nimprove performance, productivity and the cost-\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations system is an important\r\none. The adoption of resolution 50/227 — which contains\r\nfurther measures for the restructuring and revitalization of\r\nthe United Nations system in the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields — is evidence of the efforts to improve the\r\noperational aspects of the work of the system. Jamaica is\r\ncommitted to working with other Member States throughout\r\nthis session of the General Assembly to continue the\r\nprocess of strengthening the Organization.\r\nThe persistence of disputes and conflicts suggests the\r\nneed for strengthening the United Nations machinery for\r\ndealing with these problems. The Security Council, which\r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations holds the mandate\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, has\r\nan important and strategic role to play in the process. As\r\nwe all know, aspects of its composition and role are\r\ncurrently under review. Certainly, it is acknowledged that\r\nwe should be moving in the direction of greater\r\ndemocratization and increased participation by Member\r\nStates in critical decisions affecting the international\r\ncommunity. The expansion of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations and the significant changes in the political\r\nand economic conditions in Member States must surely be\r\nimportant factors in determining changes in the composition\r\nof the Council and the status of its members.\r\nJamaica is not committed to any rigid formula for\r\nchange, but whatever formula is arrived at should satisfy\r\nthe need for democratic participation consistent with the\r\nsovereign equality of States and with the equitable\r\ndistribution of seats. The need for reform should be\r\nmatched by increased political will to use the machinery of\r\nthe United Nations for the peaceful settlement of disputes\r\nand to cooperate with conciliation efforts under the auspices\r\nof the Secretary-General.\r\nReform must not be for its own sake. The purpose of\r\nreform must be to strengthen the capacity to deliver\r\nresponsive and responsible leadership on questions of peace\r\nand security, socio-economic development, human rights\r\nand environmental protection.\r\nWe understand and support the need for reform of the\r\nadministrative and management process in the system, but\r\nwhat we cannot accept are unilateral actions to force reform\r\nby withholding assessed contributions to the United\r\nNations. This has brought the Organization to the brink of\r\ninsolvency and is hampering the very efforts being made\r\nfor reform and restructuring. More critical are the serious\r\nconsequences for the development programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe current crisis will not be resolved until Member\r\nStates pay their arrears and assessed contributions\r\npromptly and without conditions. At the same time, we\r\nrecognize the need to examine carefully the existing\r\nformula for contributions. The establishment of any new\r\nformula must be based on the principles of equity and the\r\ncapacity of Member States to pay.\r\nThe agenda of issues before us at this session shows\r\nthat there is a great deal to be done. In many areas, we\r\nhave made progress, even if it has been slow. It is\r\nessential that we continue to make the effort, through\r\ndiscussion, debate and negotiation, to find solutions that\r\nremove from our world the threats of war and conflict\r\nand the pain of poverty and misery. Through our joint\r\nefforts we can make progress, reach compromises and\r\narrive at solutions that will make our world safer and give\r\neach and every one of us a greater stake in the future.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nSecretary of the General People’s Committee for Foreign\r\nLiaison and International Cooperation of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, His Excellency Mr. Omar Mustafa Muntasser.\r\nMr. Muntasser (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): It gives me great pleasure to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election as President\r\nof this session of the General Assembly. His assumption\r\nof that high post is a tribute to him personally and to his\r\ncountry, Malaysia, with which my country has good\r\nrelations and close ties enhanced by bonds of friendship\r\nand cooperation. My delegation is confident that his\r\npolitical experience and diplomatic skill will help us in\r\nachieving a successful session. He has taken over the\r\npresidency from his predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Diego Freitas do Amaral of Portugal. I should like to\r\ntake this opportunity to express our gratitude to him for\r\nthe way he conducted the affairs of the fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has shown great skill in\r\nconducting the affairs of the Organization by virtue of his\r\nlong experience, his wide knowledge of world affairs and\r\nhis grasp of the substance of regional conflicts. That is\r\nwhy he enjoys our full support in continuing at the helm\r\nof the Organization. Since he enjoys worldwide support,\r\nas expressed by several regional organizations, we are\r\nconfident that the Assembly will support his reelection to\r\nthe post of Secretary-General of the Organization so that\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nhe may continue the process he started in the field of\r\nrestructuring and strengthening the United Nations and\r\nenhancing its role to enable it fully to shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities in realizing the purposes of the Charter,\r\nnamely, the establishment of peace, justice and equality and\r\nthe promotion of development.\r\nThis session is convened in the aftermath of important\r\nevents and in the midst of vast developments. The Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women achieved good results.\r\nAttempts are being made to overcome economic difficulties,\r\npromote development, and eliminate phenomena that\r\nthreaten the environment.\r\nIt is a good omen that this session is starting at a time\r\nwhen optimism is rising as a result of the progress achieved\r\nin settling the dispute in the Balkans. But if satisfaction at\r\nsuch happy developments has been widespread, concern has\r\ndeepened over the persistence of chronic disturbances and\r\nthe eruption of destructive civil wars. To confront these\r\nevents, which threaten international peace and security, the\r\ninternational community must exert greater effort to contain\r\nsuch disturbances and wars.\r\nIn this context, it is essential to remove the obstacles\r\nhampering the implementation of peace agreements in\r\nAngola and Liberia. A definitive solution must be\r\nimplemented for the ethnic disputes in Rwanda and\r\nBurundi. The brotherly people of Somalia continue to suffer\r\nfrom long-standing problems. They expect our support for\r\na reconciliation that would meet the needs of all Somalis\r\nand respond to their hopes and aspirations. An end should\r\nbe put to the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq by\r\nlifting the sanctions, maintaining the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq and desisting from premeditated attempts\r\nto impinge on its sovereignty and its freedom in decision-\r\nmaking.\r\nMy country is extremely concerned at the latest\r\ndevelopments in Iraq. The United States aggression against\r\nIraq is a violation of its sovereignty and an interference in\r\nits internal affairs. We have confirmed and confirm again\r\ntoday that Iraq has the right to territorial integrity and to\r\nexercise sovereignty over its entire territory. For the United\r\nStates of America to consider that Iraq’s exercise of its\r\nsovereign rights constitutes aggression, at a time when Iraq\r\nis being subjected to United States aggression, is reverse\r\nlogic that must be denounced and condemned by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe conflict in the Middle East, with the question of\r\nPalestine at its core, has been among the priority issues at\r\nthe United Nations for more than half a century. Now,\r\ndespite all the talk about the peace process, the fact\r\nremains that the Palestinian people continue to be\r\ndisplaced from their homeland. Those who remain are\r\noppressed by the Israelis by collective siege and random\r\ndeportation, in total disregard of international\r\ndenunciation of such practices and in complete defiance\r\nof the international will, which supports the legitimate\r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people and calls for respect for\r\ninternational decisions calling for the full realization of all\r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people, in particular their\r\nright to return to their homeland and their right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nAs we have seen ever since the usurpation of the\r\nland of Palestine by the Israelis, the fact is that\r\noccupation and expansion have always been a constant\r\npolicy to realize israeli ambitions. Their settlement\r\nactivities increase daily. Their jails are filled with\r\nthousands of prisoners. Houses are demolished for no\r\nreason. Rash Israeli statements that the Palestinians have\r\nno right to a State of their own are often repeated, along\r\nwith acts of aggression against southern Lebanon. The\r\nIsraelis are also perpetuating their occupation of the\r\nSyrian Golan. They persevere in the judaization of\r\nJerusalem, including their designs to demolish the most\r\nimportant Islamic shrine, namely, the Holy Al-Aqsa\r\nMosque.\r\nThese Israeli actions prove that the Israelis do not\r\nwant peace. Their joining the so-called peace process is\r\nnothing more than a smoke screen to hide their attempts\r\nto impose their will on the Arab nation and make it bow\r\nin submission, thus setting a seal on their occupation and\r\ntheir sense of superiority.\r\nMy country has publicly declared that the current\r\nso-called peace arrangements will not lead to a genuine\r\nand lasting solution. Events have proved the validity of\r\nour analysis and the depth of our vision. Just, true and\r\ncomprehensive peace will not be achieved so long as the\r\nIsraelis are shedding the blood of the Palestinian people.\r\nPeace will not be sustainable under the shadow of Israel’s\r\nnuclear terrorism and its obstinate denial of the legitimate\r\nrights of the Palestinian people. Peace can come only\r\nthrough the return of the Palestinians to their homeland\r\nand the establishment of an independent, democratic State\r\nin Palestine, with Holy Jerusalem as its capital and where\r\nPalestinian Arabs and Jews would live on an equal\r\nfooting — similar to what has happened in South Africa.\r\nAnything other than that solution would ignore historical\r\nfacts and lack realism, and would only lead to more\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nbloodshed and keep the area as a pocket of tension where\r\nnobody enjoys peace or security.\r\nFive years ago, three western countries — the United\r\nStates of America, Britain and France — accused Libyan\r\ncitizens of involvement in the Pan American flight 103\r\naccident and the incident involving the French union de\r\ntranports aérens (UTA) flight 772. Despite the fact that\r\nthose who unleashed those accusations never submitted any\r\nproof or evidence to support their claims, my country has\r\ndeclared its readiness to uncover all the facts related to the\r\ntwo incidents. We started an investigation of those whom\r\nthe American and the British authorities claim are involved\r\nin the Pan American flight 103 incident.\r\nMy country has also called on the authorities in these\r\ncountries to assist with the investigation. Instead of\r\nresponding to this request, which falls within the legal\r\nframework of the dispute, the three countries have fully\r\npoliticized the problem, resorted to the Security Council\r\nand imposed Council resolution 731 (1992). Despite all this,\r\nand out of our keen desire to settle all aspects of the\r\ndispute, the Jamahiriya announced its acceptance of that\r\nresolution and took practical measures in response to it.\r\nThe Jamahiriya has condemned international terrorism\r\nin all its forms and has declared its commitment to any\r\nmeasures to be decided by the international community to\r\ncombat terrorism. Libya’s vehement determination to secure\r\nthe total eradication of terrorism is reflected in the civilized\r\nproposal contained in document A/46/840, which calls for\r\nthe convening of a special session of the General Assembly\r\nto study the causes and dimensions of this phenomenon and\r\ndevise the means that would eliminate it.\r\nThe Jamahiriya has also cooperated with the\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom in uncovering the\r\nelements accused by Britain of involvement in terrorist acts.\r\nIn the statement, circulated in document S/1995/973 of 20\r\nNovember 1995, the British informed the Security Council\r\nthat Libya’s answers to their queries about the relationship\r\nwith the provisional Irish Republic Army were satisfactory\r\nand conformed with their expectations.\r\nFurthermore, Libya has cooperated with the French\r\ninvestigating magistrate who visited Libya during the period\r\n5 to 16 July 1996. During that visit, the Libyan authorities\r\nprovided him with all the facilities he needed to conclude\r\nhis mission. Later, French statements paid tribute to the\r\npositive cooperation of the Libyan authorities with the\r\nFrench magistrate.\r\nThe Jamahiriya has proposed several solutions for\r\nthe trial of the two Libyans suspected of involvement in\r\nthe United States plane’s accident. It has proposed that\r\nthe two stand trial before a court whose venue should be\r\nagreed upon. Libya has also proposed recourse to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice after the United States and\r\nBritain refused to apply the Montreal Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil\r\nAviation of 1971, despite the fact that both countries are\r\nparties to the Convention. Libya has also accepted the\r\nproposal submitted by the League of Arab States, which\r\ncalls for trying the two suspects at the headquarters of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice in The Hague, before\r\nScottish judges and under Scottish law.\r\nThese proposed solutions which were either\r\nsubmitted or accepted by the Jamahiriya have been\r\nconfirmed on more than one occasion and before several\r\nforums, including this Assembly. This is a sufficient\r\nresponse to those who claim that Libya refuses to permit\r\nthe trial of the two suspects, and especially to President\r\nClinton, who said in his statement on 23 September that\r\nLibya refuses to surrender the persons responsible for the\r\nexplosion of Pan American flight 103. Libya has no\r\nobjection to the two suspects standing trial. The only\r\nthing that Libya wants is to guarantee them a neutral and\r\nfair trial, free from any media or political influences. We\r\nask this especially because officials in both Britain and\r\nthe United States, in their statements, have claimed that\r\nthe two Libyan citizens are guilty and should be punished,\r\nindicating that a conviction is pre-ordained before any\r\ninvestigation and before any court appearance.\r\nThe Jamahiriya’s handling of the dispute has been\r\nwidely supported internationally and by Arab and African\r\ncountries. The Organization of the Islamic Conference has\r\ndeclared its solidarity with our position. The Movement\r\nof Non-Aligned Countries supported it at Jakarta and\r\nreaffirmed that support at Cartagena. It was also strongly\r\nsupported by the Arab Summit at Cairo. The Organization\r\nof African Unity has repeatedly supported it, from the\r\n1993 Cairo Summit through the latest Summit at\r\nYaoundé.\r\nWhen the three countries were confronted by these\r\npositions, which confirmed the firm conviction that Libya\r\nhas indeed responded to the requirements of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, they started to drag other issues far\r\nremoved from the dispute and its context. Both Britain\r\nand the United States are trying to evade responsibility\r\nfor fabricating the problem. They have been attempting to\r\ndepict the dispute as one between Libya and the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\ninternational community. Is this not a reversal of the facts?\r\nHow can the dispute be one between Libya and the\r\ninternational community, when international support is\r\nincreasing daily for the Libyan position? This support is\r\nembodied in the support of regional and international\r\norganizations, the population of whose members exceeds\r\ntwo thirds of the world’s population.\r\nThose two Governments have now come up with a\r\nnew lie. They say that Libya is defying international\r\nlegality. The facts totally refute this. Libya is one of the\r\ncountries most committed to international law. Proof of this\r\nis its implementation of the verdict of the International\r\nCourt of Justice in its territorial dispute with Chad, even\r\nthough this was not in our favour. Furthermore, officials in\r\nthose two countries claim that Libya is not a peace-loving\r\nState. This is another lie. The Jamahiriya is a peace-loving\r\ncountry. It believes in peace and practices it. Its role in the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States has been\r\nembodied in its active role in trying to achieve\r\nreconciliation between Sudan and Uganda. It has also been\r\nreflected in its successful efforts at reconciling the\r\nPhilippines and the Moro National Liberation Front.\r\nRaising what has become known as the Lockerbie\r\ncrisis falls within the context of these false allegations and\r\nfabricated accusations. It confirms a fact that we have\r\nstated right from the beginning: that this is a premeditated,\r\nfabricated problem aimed at punishing the Libyan people\r\nfor certain principles in which they believe and certain\r\npositions they defend. It is as if those who created this\r\ncrisis were not content with the difficulties and pains which\r\nthe Libyan people have already suffered at the hands of the\r\ncolonialists and the fascists who, on our territory, fought a\r\nwar that killed and displaced hundreds of thousands of\r\nLibyans, and planted in their farms and under their homes\r\nmillions of land mines which still kill innocent people and\r\nimpede Libya’s efforts to protect the environment, combat\r\ndesertification, and expand in the fields of economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\nIf the aim behind the fabrication of the crisis was not\r\nto punish us for certain principles we uphold and certain\r\npositions we defend, why did the two countries refuse from\r\nthe start to apply the relevant international convention —\r\nthe Montreal Convention? Why did they drag the Security\r\nCouncil into this legal problem, which has nothing\r\nwhatsoever to do with its functions? Why did they hasten\r\nto impose sanctions on us only two months after the start\r\nof this crisis? How did these countries accord themselves\r\nthe right to participate in the voting on Security Council\r\nresolution 731 (1992), in contravention of Article 27 (3) of\r\nthe Charter? Why do the British and American\r\nGovernments reject any initiative to settle the dispute by\r\ndialogue and negotiation? What is the justification for\r\ntheir intransigence in rejecting the proposal of the League\r\nof Arab States that was accepted by Libya? Why do these\r\nStates insist on accusing our citizens when new facts have\r\nbeen uncovered and published in several books and\r\nnewspapers refuting their claims and confirming that the\r\nincident was planned by professional intelligence services\r\nto coverup certain suspicious activities? Also, why did\r\nthese States push the Security Council to adopt a double\r\nstandard, imposing sanctions on Libya under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter when it did not threaten anybody or in any\r\nway compromise international peace and security. At the\r\nsame time, these countries prevented the Security Council\r\nfrom applying the same Chapter to a major power that\r\nsent hundreds of its war planes to attack our country and\r\nbomb our cities while their residents lay sleeping in their\r\nbeds? This same big Power still practises State terrorism\r\nagainst us, freezing our financial assets and imposing\r\nunilateral sanctions on us, refusing to respond to General\r\nAssembly resolution 41/38, which calls on it to\r\ncompensate our people for the losses they suffered as a\r\nresult of its brutal aggression against us in April 1986.\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has sought to settle the\r\ndispute. All it has asked for is that it be settled in\r\naccordance with the principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the rules of international law. My\r\ncountry is satisfied because its handling of this crisis was\r\nsupported by most countries of the world. And here I\r\nwould like to pay tribute to the members of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nLeague of Arab States for their appreciation of our\r\nposition and their understanding of our earnestness in\r\nseeking a quick and just solution. In particular, we would\r\nlike to thank members of the Security Council who\r\nappreciated our response, tried to do us justice and sought\r\nto lift the unjust sanctions imposed on us.\r\nThe magnitude of the suffering of the Libyan people\r\nunder the sanctions has been detailed in document\r\nS/1996/717. Suffice it to say that the sanctions have so\r\nfar resulted in the deaths of 3,340 persons in road\r\naccidents. More than 12,000 persons have suffered serious\r\npermanent injuries because of these accidents. Moreover,\r\nthe sanctions have cost more than $18 billion in material\r\nlosses.\r\nThere is no excuse for condoning such injustice, and\r\nthe continuation of this injustice is wrong. Most countries\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nof the world have repeated their calls for an accelerated\r\nsolution of the Lockerbie crisis, in accordance with\r\ninternational laws and conventions. The Jamahiriya has\r\naccepted that. The obstacle lies in the blind intransigence\r\nand illogical demands of the American and British\r\nGovernments. Should the two Governments persist in their\r\nuncompromising positions, refuse to settle the dispute in a\r\nspirit of justice and fairness, and relieve the suffering our\r\npeople have endured for more than four years, the only\r\nthing left to the Libyan people would be to appeal to those\r\nin this forum with clean consciences to intensify their\r\nefforts in order to expose the unjust practices exercised by\r\nthe United States and Britain to extend the duration of the\r\nblockade imposed on a small people. Members of this\r\nAssembly should implement the decisions taken by the\r\nHeads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement in Cartagena, by the Arab Heads of State at the\r\nCairo summit and by the African Heads of State in the\r\nYaoundé summit not to continue compliance with the\r\nsanctions resolutions. They should also consider possible\r\nways of sparing the Libyan people more losses if the\r\nwestern countries persist in rejecting initiatives for a\r\npeaceful solution.\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the establishment of security and the\r\nenhancement of cooperation in the Mediterranean region. It\r\nreaffirms its conviction that stability in this area will be\r\nrealized only through an end to military exercises in the\r\nMediterranean, the closure of foreign military bases, the\r\nwithdrawal of foreign fleets and the development of a\r\nsound formula, refuting the policy of exclusion, that would\r\nenable the Mediterranean countries to contribute to the\r\nenhancement of their security and the promotion of\r\ncooperation. By virtue of its distinct location in that region\r\nand the stability it enjoys, the Jamahiriya can play an\r\nimportant role in strengthening security in the\r\nMediterranean by reducing migration from the southern\r\ncoastal States to the North and the elimination of\r\ndestructive movements that exploit and have been\r\nrepudiated by Islam for undermining the stability of a\r\nnumber of littoral countries of the Mediterranean. The\r\nJamahiriya would be able to play a bigger role in these\r\nfields if the sanctions imposed on it were lifted and external\r\nattempts to undermine its security and stability were to\r\nstop.\r\nMy country supports the non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons as a prelude to prohibiting and destroying all\r\nweapons of mass destruction. We welcome the international\r\ntreaties and conventions concluded with a view to\r\ncontrolling these destructive weapons and their ultimate\r\nelimination. In particular, my country welcomes the\r\nconclusion of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\r\nTreaty. However, we believe that other measures should\r\nbe taken to guarantee the total eradication of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, including a timetable for the destruction\r\nof these weapons. It is necessary to take drastic and\r\npunitive measures with regard to a major nuclear power\r\nthat transported nuclear material to its own territory and\r\nstill procrastinates in disposing of it under international\r\nsupervision. It is also highly important to formulate an\r\ninternational instrument guaranteeing the security and\r\nsafety of non-nuclear States. The Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty recently approved by the General\r\nAssembly falls short of the aspirations of the peoples of\r\nthe world to a total ban on all nuclear tests. As\r\nformulated, the Treaty merely perpetuates the status quo.\r\nIt could even pre-empt efforts aimed at achieving a world\r\ntotally free from nuclear terror. In the context of other\r\nsteps that should be taken to eliminate nuclear weapons,\r\nit is essential to take serious international measures to\r\nguarantee the universality of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nThe Jamahiriya has a special interest in this question\r\nbecause the region in which we live is greatly threatened\r\nby the fact that the Israelis possess terrifying nuclear\r\nweapons with over 200 nuclear warheads. They also have\r\nnuclear facilities that they refuse to place under\r\ninternational control. What adds to our concern is the fact\r\nthat, in addition to the Israeli nuclear terror which\r\nthreatens the lives of the residents of Arab cities and\r\nvillages every day, a major nuclear Power not only turns\r\na blind eye to this terror, but even works to develop and\r\nenhance it. This same major Power threatens any Arab\r\ncountry, even if it was merely building a pharmaceutical\r\nproduct factory under the pretext of saving the world\r\nfrom chemical weapons.\r\nThe existence of the Israeli nuclear arsenal cannot be\r\ntaken lightly or condoned. If the international community\r\nis truly keen to ensure the security and stability of our\r\nregion, it should take measures to guarantee Israel’s\r\naccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and the placing of their nuclear\r\nfacilities under the International Atomic Energy Agency’s\r\nsafeguards system. There must also be a timetable for\r\ndismantling their nuclear stockpiles. Should the failure to\r\nforce Israel to do that continue, it would be legitimate for\r\nthe countries in the area to acquire, in self-defence, means\r\nto guarantee their safety and enable them to face the\r\nIsraeli nuclear threat to their very existence.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe world has witnessed colossal changes. If we are\r\nto adapt to these changes, we must restructure the United\r\nNations to make it better able to respond to international\r\nneeds and to meet the interests and wishes of Member\r\nStates.\r\nMy country has followed the negotiations aimed at\r\nstrengthening the United Nations system and at reforming\r\nthe Security Council. We believe that this process, pursued\r\nby Member States for some time now, should be\r\naccelerated and concluded, resulting in measures that could\r\nenhance the powers of the General Assembly, including on\r\nmatters of international peace and security.\r\nWe urge that the negotiations lead to steps that would\r\nenable the Security Council better to carry out its mandate,\r\nin conformity with the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter. Any increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil should be based not on a selective approach, but on\r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States and\r\nequitable geographic distribution, taking into consideration\r\nthe interests of the developing countries that constitute the\r\nmajority of United Nations Member States. The veto\r\nprivilege, which has become the focus of interest of most\r\ncountries, should be at the core of the reform process.\r\nThere is no longer any justification for maintaining this\r\nprivilege. The new international arena needs a democratic\r\nSecurity Council, not one in which the few enjoy\r\ndiscriminatory rights. My country, which has been in the\r\nforefront of those calling for the abrogation of the veto\r\npower, once again urges that the measures aimed at\r\nreforming the Security Council include arrangements\r\nultimately leading to the elimination of this privilege, which\r\ncontradicts the principle of sovereign equality of States and\r\nalso runs counter to democracy. Preserving it would impede\r\nthe Organizations’s efforts to maintain and preserve\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe world cannot be secure until its economic\r\nproblems and development are addressed. Looking at the\r\ninternational scene, we find that the economies and level of\r\ngrowth of most developing countries continue to languish.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to state that these conditions may\r\ndeteriorate further if effective measures are not taken to\r\nreverse them. The Charter of the United Nations is\r\nanchored on two basic pillars: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and international\r\ncooperation for economic and social development. The\r\nclose connection between the two pillars requires the United\r\nNations to strive to achieve both equally.\r\nWe believe that no sound international economic\r\nenvironment can be possible without a true world\r\npartnership for development. This requires that North-\r\nSouth dialogue be resumed and that the developing\r\ncountries be enabled to participate effectively in making\r\ndecisions affecting international economic conditions. In\r\nthis context, commitments for promoting development in\r\ndeveloping countries should be undertaken in a realistic\r\nmanner that would end trade protectionism against the\r\nexports of developing countries, lift restrictions on the\r\ntransfer of technology to them and ensure the payment of\r\nremunerative prices for their commodities.\r\nIt is essential that special priority be given to the\r\neconomic situation in Africa and to the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s. The western countries have a moral\r\nduty to help end underdevelopment in Africa, given the\r\ncontinent’s suffering under colonialism, when its wealth\r\nwas plundered by these countries, which stole its natural\r\nresources and denied it opportunities for development and\r\nprogress.\r\nAs part of the efforts of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\nin the areas of economic development, environmental\r\nprotection, expansion of agrarian reform and the provision\r\nof drinking water, the Libyan people, in the midst of their\r\njoy at the start of the twenty-eighth year of the 1\r\nSeptember revolution, have celebrated the conclusion of\r\nthe second phase of the Great Man-Made River Project,\r\nwhose waters have reached the city of Tripoli, where\r\nthere is a dense population and arable land. The Libyan\r\npeople have realized this achievement despite the ongoing\r\nembargo and the coercive economic practices imposed on\r\nit for over a decade. These measures were recently\r\ntightened by a law whose provisions are applicable to the\r\ncompanies of States that deal with us. This constitutes a\r\nflagrant violation of the purposes of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and an intentional disregard for the rules\r\nof international law. It is also a clear contradiction of the\r\nAgreement establishing the World Trade Organization.\r\nMy country has followed with keen interest the\r\nreactions of anger and denunciation following the\r\nenactment of that law. We would like to express our\r\nsatisfaction at the inclusion of an item on this matter on\r\nthe General Assembly’s agenda for this session. We hope\r\nthat member States will discuss this question, study it\r\ncarefully and ultimately adopt a measure to thwart this\r\nlaw, through which the United States of America is\r\nattempting to impose its laws on the international\r\ncommunity. This Assembly should take the necessary\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\neffective measures to end all coercive economic\r\narrangements being imposed on a number of developing\r\ncountries, in implementation of the General Assembly\r\nresolutions prohibiting any country from enacting extra-\r\nterritorial laws or resorting to coercive measures to force\r\nanother country to relinquish the exercise of its sovereign\r\nrights.\r\nThe next century is but a few years away. Before it\r\nbegins, all the members of the international community\r\nshould use the remaining time to eliminate all remnants of\r\nrecent decades, which were characterized by tension and\r\nconfrontation. As we enter the third millennium, we should\r\nlive in a world governed by a system based on justice,\r\nequality and respect for the political and economic choices\r\nof peoples. Such a system should embody full commitment\r\nto international law and the principles and purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations. It must protect and enhance human rights\r\nand strengthen efforts aimed at eradicating poverty,\r\nsuffering, discord, conflicts, disputes and wars. It should be\r\na system in which no country can aspire to hegemony or\r\nabuse its influence, a system that supports the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. It should give all peoples the\r\nopportunity to look to the future with optimism.\r\nThe United Nations remains the most valid forum and\r\nthe best tool for building a world consensus in this respect.\r\nLet us reform and strengthen this Organization so that it\r\nwill be able to meet these requirements, all of which\r\nemanate from its aims and purposes — the establishment of\r\npeace and security, and the promotion of economic and\r\nsocial development in the interests of progress, welfare and\r\nprosperity for future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vahan Papazian.\r\nMr. Papazian (Armenia): At the outset, I would like\r\nto congratulate the President on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nGiven his talent and experience, I am confident that he will\r\nguide this session to a successful completion of the noble\r\nmission entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nI would also like to express my appreciation and\r\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas Do Amaral,\r\nfor his outstanding leadership in accomplishing the tasks of\r\nthe last session.\r\nThe end of the cold war has given a decisive\r\nimpetus to globalization by offering former socialist\r\neconomies the opportunity to assume their rightful place\r\nin the world economy. The challenges posed by extremely\r\nrapid transformation are nowhere more graphically\r\ndepicted than in the current transition of the countries of\r\nEastern and Central Europe and in the former Union of\r\nSoviet Socialist Republics.\r\nIn addition to severe economic and social problems\r\nresulting from the extraordinary changes buffeting the\r\ncountry, the transition process in Armenia has been\r\nexacerbated by the transport and energy blockade by\r\nneighbouring Azerbaijan, the devastation caused by the\r\nmassive earthquake of 1988, the conflict between\r\nNagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijan and the presence of\r\nmore than 300,000 refugees.\r\nDespite such serious circumstances, economic\r\nreforms begun after the declaration of independence in\r\n1991 have been continued and expanded over the past\r\nyear. Having achieved a fair degree of economic stability,\r\nthe Government of Armenia has designed a medium-term\r\neconomic programme for 1996-1998. Armenia’s medium-\r\nterm policy objectives are to maintain financial stability\r\nand establish the institutions and mechanisms of a market\r\neconomy by the end of the programme period in order to\r\nlay the foundation for sustainable growth and a viable\r\nbalance of payments. Consistent with this strategy, the\r\nmain macroeconomic objectives of the programme are to\r\nraise the economic growth rate from 5 per cent in 1995\r\nto 7 per cent in 1998; to lower inflation to 8 per cent by\r\nthe end of 1998; and to narrow the current account deficit\r\nfrom 26 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1995\r\nto 12 per cent in 1998. To cope with the social pressures\r\ninvolved in the transition process, the reorientation of\r\nsocial expenditures towards the most vulnerable remains\r\na high-priority task. The programme lays emphasis on\r\nimproving the targeting of the social safety net and\r\nintensifying efforts to rationalize social expenditures.\r\nWhile each country is responsible for its own\r\neconomic policies for development, in accordance with its\r\nspecific situation and conditions, the reactivation of\r\neconomic growth and development in all countries\r\nrequires a concerted effort of the international community.\r\nHere, particular attention should be given to the needs of\r\nthe countries with economies in transition, without this\r\naffecting development assistance to the developing\r\ncountries.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThe completion of the transition process, the\r\nintegration of these countries into the world economy and\r\ntheir effective involvement in the multilateral institutions\r\nwill have a positive impact not only on these countries\r\nthemselves, but also on the global economy.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, it is the\r\ncollective responsibility of the international community to\r\nensure that, within the multidimensional and integrated\r\ncharacter of its mandate, the United Nations system is\r\nequipped to show leadership in the fulfilment of the\r\ncommitments made to international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative for Africa exemplifies the system’s\r\ncommitment to collaborative action and its renewed\r\ncommitment to supporting Africa’s development. Launched\r\nlast March by the Secretary-General, this Initiative is the\r\nlargest coordinated action in the history of the United\r\nNations. While it is clear that the implementation of the\r\nInitiative will be led at the country level by Governments,\r\nthe United Nations agencies will hold themselves mutually\r\naccountable for achieving this Initiative’s goals.\r\nThe United Nations, in cooperation with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, other bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem, including its specialized agencies, and the World\r\nTrade Organization, has a key role in fostering greater\r\ncoherence, complementarity and coordination in global\r\neconomic policy-making. The General Assembly should\r\nexert greater policy leadership on development issues\r\ninasmuch as the Charter of the United Nations provides the\r\nAssembly with broad mandates concerning these issues. In\r\naccordance with relevant provisions of the Charter, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council must continue to strengthen\r\nits role as the central mechanism for coordinating the\r\npolicies and activities of the United Nations, its specialized\r\nagencies and funds in the economic, social and related\r\nfields. It should provide overall guidance and coordination\r\nto the United Nations development system. The Council\r\nmust also promote a coordinated follow-up to the outcomes\r\nof major international conferences.\r\nRecommendations adopted by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council at its 1996 substantive session on\r\nstrengthening collaboration between the United Nations and\r\nBretton Woods institutions and on new arrangements for\r\nconsultations with non-governmental organizations\r\nrepresented a great step forward.\r\nModern democracy is the political counterpart of the\r\nmarket economic system, and the two go hand in hand.\r\nThe success of a democracy requires informed and civil\r\ndiscourse and respect for the rule of law and the\r\ndemocratic process, including the expression of the public\r\nwill through free and fair elections.\r\nThe recent, vigorously contested presidential election\r\nsignalled the vitality of the democratic process in\r\nArmenia. President Levon Ter-Petrossian’s re-election\r\ndemonstrates the will of the people in support of the\r\npolicies pursued thus far by the Government, based on a\r\nclear programme and an achievable plan of development.\r\nDevelopment cannot be attained in the absence of\r\nrespect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nArmenia strongly supports the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights in his efforts to restructure the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights. The Member States must continue\r\nworking towards better coordination within the Centre and\r\nconsolidation of human-rights functions within the United\r\nNations system.\r\nArmenia considers self-determination in its multitude\r\nof manifestations to be an inalienable human right. In this\r\nlight, the Nagorny Karabakh conflict continues to concern\r\nthe Government of Armenia and its peaceful resolution\r\nremains Armenia’s top foreign-policy priority. A few\r\nmonths ago, on 12 May, we marked the second\r\nanniversary of the cease-fire in the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nconflict. At the same time, the parties to the conflict\r\nreleased all prisoners of war and hostages identified by\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross. We\r\nconsider these developments encouraging and conducive\r\nto the overall peace process and to the establishment of a\r\nfavourable atmosphere for negotiations.\r\nNegotiations among the parties within the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) Minsk Group on a political agreement continued\r\nduring the past year. We believe that the signing of the\r\nagreement provides the best hope for consolidating the\r\ncease-fire and making the peace process irreversible. The\r\nelements of the political agreement, and most importantly\r\nthe security provisions for Nagorny Karabakh, will\r\neventually comprise an inseparable part of any settlement,\r\nregardless of the ultimate status of Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nAlso this year, the parties took an extra step to\r\nestablish a second negotiating track through immediate\r\nand direct contacts, as mandated by the December 1995\r\nmeeting of the OSCE Council of Ministers in Budapest.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nThus far, several rounds of talks have taken place between\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan in which general aspects of key\r\nissues have been discussed. We are hopeful that the\r\nrepresentative of Nagorny Karabakh will join in upcoming\r\nrounds, for we strongly believe that no final solution can be\r\nachieved without Karabakh’s direct participation in the\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThe peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict\r\nremains Armenia’s first priority. Armenia is committed to\r\nthe talks on both tracks and will remain constructively\r\nengaged in both processes. We believe that these two tracks\r\ncompliment each other and that any progress we make on\r\neither can only positively impact the other, ultimately\r\nleading to a breakthrough.\r\nDuring the past five years, Armenia has experienced\r\nfirst hand how war, armed conflict and regional instability\r\nin general can hamper economic progress and development.\r\nThus, I would like to reiterate Armenia’s commitment to\r\nmaintaining the existing cease-fire, while eagerly searching\r\nfor a solution based on good will, mutual compromise and\r\nunderstanding.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nposes a serious threat to both global and regional security\r\nand stability. The adoption last month by the General\r\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nrepresented the international community’s determination to\r\nbring to a completion one of the most sought after non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament measures in the history of\r\nthis Organization. It gave me much satisfaction to sign the\r\nTreaty earlier today on behalf of the Government and\r\npeople of Armenia.\r\nVirtually all States Members of the United Nations\r\nfavour an increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, reflecting the radical changes in the world and the\r\nincrease in the Organization’s overall membership.\r\nHowever, during the discussions in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group, wide support has been expressed for the\r\nview that, if there is no agreement on other categories of\r\nmembership, expansion should take place, for the time\r\nbeing, in the non-permanent category alone. Armenia\r\nfavours an increase in the non-permanent membership of\r\nthe Council that would incorporate the interests of all the\r\nregional Groups and correspond to the principle of equitable\r\ngeographic distribution.\r\nIn order to carry out its activities, the United Nations\r\nneeds financial means. The financing of the Organization is\r\nthe collective responsibility of all Member States and\r\nArmenia is not indifferent to the financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that Armenia\r\nwill do its best to fulfil its financial obligations. However,\r\nthere is an urgent need to adopt a global package of\r\nmeasures to solve the grave financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations. These measures should contemplate,\r\ninter alia, review of the scale of assessments so that it\r\nwould reflect as accurately as possible the principle of\r\ncapacity to pay.\r\nAllow me to conclude by wishing the General\r\nAssembly every success in the demanding work it faces\r\nduring this session, and by pledging Armenia’s most\r\nactive and effective cooperation with the delegations of\r\nother States.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate for this meeting.\r\nA number of delegations have asked to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply. I remind members that\r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to\r\n10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes\r\nfor the second, and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Abolhassani Shahreza (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): Today the Foreign Minister of the United Arab\r\nEmirates levelled a number of baseless allegations and\r\nraised unacceptable claims against the territorial integrity\r\nof my country. These claims have no historical or legal\r\nfoundation. We have made our position in this regard\r\nvery clear on previous occasions. Moreover, we do not\r\nreally see any genuine usefulness in a rhetorical approach\r\nto this issue, whether in the General Assembly or in other\r\ninternational gatherings. Indeed, these considerations will\r\nmake my remarks very brief.\r\nAs noted before, we are against any measure which\r\ncould cause instability in the Persian Gulf region. The\r\npeople of the region are still suffering from the\r\nconsequences of the wars and miscalculations of the\r\nrecent past. While fully aware of the sensitivity of the\r\nPersian Gulf region, the Islamic Republic of Iran is\r\ncommitted to respect and maintain peace, security and\r\ntranquillity in that region.\r\nTherefore, we believe that the misunderstandings that\r\nhave arisen in bilateral relations can be addressed with\r\ngood will. We continue to be determined to maintain and\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\npromote brotherly and good-neighbourly relations between\r\nthe two countries. We are, fortunately, backed by a history\r\nof cordial and friendly relations with the United Arab\r\nEmirates. We are confident that the existing\r\nmisunderstanding will be resolved in our bilateral talks in\r\na neighbourly atmosphere.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the readiness of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, put forth in the statement today, to\r\nengage in bilateral discussions without any preconditions by\r\neither side.\r\nMr. Gnehm (United States of America): The\r\nstatement made today by the Head of the delegation of the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya is yet another example of Libya’s\r\nconstant campaign to try to turn its international obligations\r\ninto an issue between States. This is not an issue between\r\nStates. Nor, as it was just alleged, has the Security Council\r\nadopted a so-called double standard with respect to Libya.\r\nWhat it has adopted is a principled stand against States\r\nwhich sponsor terrorism. The issue is Libyan failure to\r\ncomply with international obligations imposed on Libya by\r\nthe Security Council. Those obligations are clear. Those\r\nobligations have not changed. So-called compromises\r\noffered by Libya are unacceptable. There can be no\r\nnegotiation between Libya and the Security Council on the\r\nfulfilment of Chapter VII obligations.\r\nLibya’s refusal to meet the requirements of the\r\nSecurity Council shows the measure of its regard for the\r\nUnited Nations. Evasion of these requirements will not\r\nbring a solution to the problem between Libya and the\r\nworld of nations. The Government of Libya knows what\r\nneeds to be done to bring an end to sanctions: full\r\ncompliance with the relevant resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil. The sooner it does this, the better for all.\r\nThe Head of the delegation of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya raised the subject of United States law related\r\nto sanctions on Libya. A preference to act multilaterally and\r\nfor consultation with other Governments is built into our\r\nlaw. In implementing it, the Administration of the United\r\nStates of America will be mindful of our international\r\nobligations. This act is designed to deter, not to punish, and\r\nto help guard the international system from the threat posed\r\nby Libyan support for terrorism.\r\nMr. Hollis (United Kingdom): In his speech, the head\r\nof the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya referred to\r\nthe bombings of Pan American flight 103 and UTA flight\r\n772 — terrorist incidents in which 441 people from 27\r\nseparate States Members of the United Nations were\r\nmurdered.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to re-state my\r\nGovernment’s position. Libya is once again trying to\r\ncloud the issue at hand. This is not about a dispute\r\nbetween the Libyan Government and a number of\r\ncountries. It is about the need for the international\r\ncommunity to respond to acts of international terrorism,\r\nand about the consistent failure of the Libyan Government\r\nto comply fully with Security Council resolutions 731\r\n(1992), 748 (1992) and 883 (1993).\r\nCompliance with Security Council resolutions under\r\nChapter VII is an obligation of all States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. The United Kingdom seeks no more, and\r\nno less, than that Libya demonstrate its respect for the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community by\r\ncomplying fully with the relevant resolutions. It is not for\r\nLibya to try to negotiate with the Security Council about\r\nits obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter. These\r\nobligations are clearly set out in the resolutions. So-called\r\ncompromises offered by the Libyans, and referred to in\r\nthe Libyan representative’s speech, are not acceptable.\r\nIt is for the Security Council — not for the Libyan\r\nGovernment — to decide on measures necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It is for\r\nthe Libyan Government to abide by these decisions —\r\npromptly and in full.\r\nMs. Gazeau-Secret (France) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The French delegation feels that it must set out\r\nsome facts and clarify certain points in connection with\r\nthe statement made by the Libyan Foreign Minister,\r\nMr. Omar Mustafa Muntasser.\r\nThe attack on UTA flight 772 and the attack against\r\nPan American flight 103 at Lockerbie are not disputes\r\nbetween Libya and three Member States. Rather, they are\r\na dispute between Libya and the Security Council.\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992) and\r\n843 (1993) describe what the Council expects of the\r\nLibyan authorities.\r\nThe proposal made by the League of Arab States,\r\nwhich was mentioned by the Libyan Foreign Minister, is\r\nnot an appropriate response to the requirements of the\r\nSecurity Council in connection with the terrorist act\r\nperpetrated against Pan American flight 103.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nAs regards UTA flight 772, the French delegation\r\nconfirms that the visit to Tripoli by the French magistrate\r\nin charge of the investigation of 5-16 July 1996 went\r\nsmoothly. The magistrate stated he was satisfied with the\r\ncooperation of the Libyan authorities during his visit there.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the results of the visit will make\r\nit possible to make progress in implementing the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, and that the Libyan authorities will\r\ncontinue their efforts to act in accordance with all their\r\nobligations in connection with both UTA flight 772 and Pan\r\nAm flight 103. Only the fulfilment of their obligations will\r\nmake it possible for the sanctions imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil to be lifted.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): In responding to the statement by the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the 25-\r\nyear-long Iranian occupation of the three islands — Greater\r\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — which belong to the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, I wish to state that since its\r\nestablishment my country has pursued a policy based on\r\npeaceful coexistence, good neighbourliness, rejection of the\r\nuse or threat of use of force and resort to peaceful means\r\nin the settlement of disputes, in keeping with the holy\r\nprinciples of Islam, as well as the principles enshrined in\r\nthe United Nations Charter and other international\r\ninstruments.\r\nMy country has always rejected the Iranian occupation\r\nof the three islands. We have called on the Iranian\r\nGovernment to resolve the dispute over the islands through\r\nbilateral negotiations or mediation by the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has responded to all the\r\ngood offices of many friendly and brotherly countries in an\r\nattempt to resolve the dispute peacefully. The latest instance\r\nwas our response to an invitation to participate in a group\r\nof experts in Qatar in 1995, in order to agree on an agenda\r\nfor bilateral negotiations between the two countries to\r\nresolve the dispute on the three islands peacefully.\r\nHowever, the Iranian Government insisted on secondary\r\nissues, unrelated to the question, thus showing a lack of\r\nseriousness and readiness to tackle the issue on a bilateral\r\nlevel.\r\nHistorical facts contradict the Iranian Government’s\r\nclaims. Indeed, they raise the question of how these three\r\nislands can be Iranian when the Iranian Government itself\r\nresorted to an attempt to purchase them or rent them as far\r\nback as 1929. They then proceeded to occupy the three\r\nislands in 1971.\r\nIn his statement on 23 September 1996, the Foreign\r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Iran said:\r\n“the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to\r\narticulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed\r\nat fostering greater regional confidence; enhancing\r\nrespect for principles of international law; bringing\r\nabout transparency in armaments and reduction of\r\nmilitary spending; creating zones free from weapons\r\nof mass destruction; strengthening peace and security\r\nthrough persistent endeavours to encourage and\r\nfacilitate understanding and conciliation; and\r\nconsolidating economic cooperation.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fifty-first Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 4th meeting, p. 28)\r\nThis statement contradicts Iranian behaviour. In\r\nrecent years, there has been an attempt to promote and\r\nstrengthen military control over the three islands,\r\nincluding the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction\r\nand the entrenchment of the occupation of the three\r\nislands. This belies any claims to transparency in\r\narmaments or to conciliation and cooperation. The United\r\nArab Emirates Government hopes that this declaration of\r\nposition by the Iranian Foreign Minister in his statement\r\nto the General Assembly will be translated into reality,\r\nparticularly, as it relates to the three islands, through a\r\nreview by Iran of its unacceptable policies in the light of\r\ncurrent regional and international developments and in\r\nresponse to our initiatives calling for unconditional\r\nbilateral negotiations or resort to the International Court\r\nof Justice to reach a just settlement ending Iranian\r\noccupation of our three islands and achieving the\r\naspirations of peoples of the region to a new era of\r\nbilateral and collective relations in the interest of\r\neconomic and social development, as well as regional and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Muntasser (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): I wish to comment on the\r\nstatements made by the representatives of the United\r\nStates of America and the United Kingdom.\r\nWe have become accustomed to this kind of talk from\r\nthe representative of the United States of America. This\r\nis not the first time, following a Libyan statement, that we\r\nhave heard the same old story: that the dispute between\r\nLibya and the United States is a dispute between Libya\r\nand the Security Council.\r\nI will not go on at length at this late hour. I would\r\nonly like to reconfirm to the Assembly that Libya has\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 October 1996\r\nresponded in time to the Security Council resolutions, and\r\nin particular resolution 731 (1992), whose provisions have\r\nbeen implemented. We have denounced terrorism and have\r\ncooperated with the United Kingdom on the issues on\r\nwhich our cooperation was requested, in particular with\r\nregard to the Irish Republican Army. We have also\r\ncooperated with France. As the Assembly heard from the\r\nrepresentative of France a while ago, there was a visit to\r\nLibya by a magistrate, who made contacts and carried out\r\nan investigation. The representative of France declared, as\r\ndid the representative of the United Kingdom last year, that\r\nLibya has cooperated in that regard.\r\nWith regard to the dispute between Libya and the\r\nSecurity Council, I would like to note that the League of\r\nArab States decision, which has been supported and\r\naccepted by Libya, has also been supported and accepted by\r\nmany international organizations, such as the Organization\r\nof African Unity, which has more than 50 members. The\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, with a membership of over 100,\r\nhas also supported that decision. It has also been supported\r\nby the Organization of the Islamic Conference, with more\r\nthan 50 members. The whole world, even some Security\r\nCouncil members, support the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya’s\r\nposition.\r\nWhat remains to be done in implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 731 (1992) is to deport the\r\ndetainees, or the accused, and Libya rejects that notion.\r\nWe have contributed as much as we can to all attempts to\r\nfind a peaceful resolution to the dispute. We have\r\naccepted the League of Arab States proposal to have the\r\naccused tried in a neutral setting before the International\r\nCourt of Justice and by Scottish judges in accordance\r\nwith Scottish laws. All these proposals have been rejected\r\nby those two countries. We absolutely cannot deport our\r\ncitizens in violation of our national laws. We do not have\r\nextradition treaties with those two countries. We are\r\nprepared to have the accused tried in a neutral setting, not\r\nin the atmosphere prevailing in the United States and the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\nAll that has been said by the representatives of the\r\nUnited States and of the United Kingdom is but an\r\nattempt to avoid the facts. This is not an international\r\ndispute. As the Libyan Foreign Minister made clear, such\r\na position is contrary to fact. How could this be an\r\ninternational dispute when Libya’s position enjoys\r\ninternational support from countries representing more\r\nthan two thirds of the world’s population?\r\nI shall not go into the details, but I would like to\r\nstate to the representative of the United States that a law\r\nsuch as the D’Amato law is not at all helpful. Suffice it\r\nto recall what the representative of France said here; all\r\nof us know that she was referring to the D’Amato law.\r\nThe United States of America wants to impose its\r\nnational laws on other countries; it wants its national laws\r\nto transcend its national boundaries; it wants them applied\r\nto other countries. Suffice it to recall what the French\r\nAmbassador and many other speakers have said, and the\r\ndisapproval of the news media. I do not wish to respond\r\nto the representative of France, because the response is\r\ncontained in her own statement. And I would like to\r\nthank France for that.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n30\r\n"
