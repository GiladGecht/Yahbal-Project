(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency Mr. Domingo\r\nSiazon, Jr., Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Siazon (Philippines): On behalf of my delegation,\r\nSir, I take pleasure in extending to you our heartfelt\r\nfelicitations on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We in the\r\nPhilippines and in the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) derive special gratification from\r\ncongratulating you, a citizen of an ASEAN country, on this\r\ngreat honour.\r\nThe Philippines pays tribute to Secretary-General\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, who has led our Organization in the\r\nmost difficult circumstances.\r\nI must beg your indulgence, Mr. President, and that of\r\nour colleagues to speak briefly about recent events in my\r\ncountry, developments which we consider historic, opening\r\na bright new chapter in the history of the Philippines.\r\nExactly a month ago, on 2 September, the Philippine\r\nGovernment and the Moro National Liberation Front\r\n(MNLF), which had waged a rebellion for more than a\r\nquarter of a century, signed an agreement ending the\r\nconflict in Mindanao and establishing a zone of peace and\r\ndevelopment in that island-region.\r\nOn 9 September, Professor Nur Misuari, leader of\r\nthe MNLF, ran for and was elected to the office of\r\nGovernor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim\r\nMindanao, which is, by virtue of a plebiscite, composed\r\nof four provinces in which Muslim Filipinos are in the\r\nmajority.\r\nAt the same time, in accordance with the 2\r\nSeptember agreement, the Southern Philippines Council\r\nfor Peace and Development is being organized under the\r\nleadership of the MNLF to help promote peace and\r\ndevelopment in 14 provinces and nine cities in the\r\nsouthern Philippines. Thus has the Philippines opted for\r\nnational reconciliation as the only true road to peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nHere, I pay tribute and give thanks to the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and to the\r\nOIC’s Committee of Six on the Situation of the Muslims\r\nin the Southern Philippines, under the wise and vigorous\r\nleadership of Indonesia and with the especially active\r\ninvolvement of Libya, for guiding us along that road\r\ntowards the goal which we have now achieved.\r\nI mention this because I know that what is\r\nessentially a domestic development in the Philippines\r\nfinds resonance in other places and in the world at large.\r\nWe all know only too well that conflicts arising\r\nfrom ethnic and cultural differences are not unique to the\r\nPhilippines. But just as the Mindanao conflict was not\r\nunique, neither was the process of reconciliation that\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nended it. We consider the settlement in Mindanao a\r\nreflection of the salutary trend towards peace and\r\nreconciliation in the world, as well as a modest contribution\r\nto it.\r\nIn South Africa, the racist abomination that was\r\napartheid has been abolished, and a multiracial Government\r\nbased on the rule of the majority and the rights of the\r\nminority has been put in place, lending new stability to\r\nsouthern Africa.\r\nIn the Middle East, nations in contention agreed to\r\ntake the road of peace. Regrettably, recent events have\r\nshown that the road is still strewn with obstacles. We retain\r\nthe faith that these obstacles are surmountable with good\r\nwill and a firm conviction that peace must not be destroyed\r\nagain in a land so revered by people of many faiths. Our\r\nmost fervent prayers go to the leaders and nations involved\r\nthat they may soon return to the path of mutual\r\nunderstanding, reconciliation, justice and peace, for both the\r\nPalestinian and the Israeli peoples.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, we can at least hope that\r\nthe Dayton accords, as well as the 14 September and\r\nsubsequent elections, will put behind us the singular horror\r\nof “ethnic cleansing” and lead to a situation where different\r\nethnic groups can live once again in peace and tolerance.\r\nIn this hemisphere, the Government of Guatemala and\r\narmed dissidents have achieved an accord of security and\r\njustice.\r\nIn our own region of South-East Asia, we look\r\nforward to the completion of a new Constitution by\r\nMyanmar that will provide a place in the nation’s political\r\nlife for the nationalities that have for so long been in\r\nrebellion and for political groups of many persuasions.\r\nUnfortunately, inter-ethnic conflicts in far too many\r\nplaces continue to inflict suffering on innocent people —\r\nnotably, for example, in Rwanda and Burundi.\r\nAround the world, simmering beneath the surface, are\r\ngrievances arising from growing disparities in economic\r\nwell-being and social status within States and nations.\r\nHowever, on a global scale, there is a clear trend towards\r\nreconciliation and tolerance. As it is within nations, so is it\r\nbetween nations. We may be witnessing a new era, one not\r\nonly of relative peace but also of close cooperation in\r\ndealing with the global challenges of today.\r\nThe cold war has ended, and with it the deadly\r\nreality of armed confrontation between nuclear-armed\r\nblocs.\r\nEven the old North-South economic divide is being\r\nsubsumed in a new global trading regime and in regional\r\neconomic arrangements, such as the Asia-Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation, in which the interests of both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries are taken into\r\naccount. These developments in reconciliation and\r\ncooperation give us hope that mankind can find the will\r\nto work together in meeting the old and new challenges\r\nthat confront the world as a whole.\r\nI see six major challenges that are central to the\r\nfuture welfare and the very survival of mankind.\r\nThe first has to do with the surfeit of weapons that\r\ncontinues to plague the world, particularly the continued\r\ndeployment and development of nuclear arms and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction, the expanding volume of\r\nthe traffic in conventional arms and the continued\r\nproduction and persistent use of especially injurious\r\ndevices of war.\r\nThe second lies in the potential for conflict over\r\nmaritime jurisdictions and resources and the need for\r\nstable maritime regimes. Another is mankind’s continuing\r\nassault on the environment, putting into question the\r\nsustainability of the world’s development. Yet another\r\nchallenge is the need to maintain the momentum of the\r\nliberalization of international trade while cushioning\r\nweaker nations and vulnerable sectors of society from its\r\nundesirable effects. The fifth challenge is the necessity of\r\nensuring human welfare and dignity within the nation-\r\nState and within society. The sixth and last is the growing\r\nmenace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror,\r\ndeadly weapons, illicit drugs, indentured labour, and the\r\nbodies of our women and children across international\r\nborders.\r\nWe have made significant progress in the control of\r\narms; but the world remains a dangerous place, and much\r\nwork remains to be done. We have extended indefinitely\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). Many of us have signed the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that the General Assembly\r\nadopted last month. But we should not stop there, for\r\nthese are but steps on the road towards complete nuclear\r\ndisarmament. We continue to call upon the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to take seriously their commitment under\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nArticle VI of the NPT to negotiate in good faith the\r\nabolition of nuclear weapons.\r\nTowards this end, the Philippines once more joins the\r\ncall for the parties to the NPT to draw up an international\r\nconvention prohibiting the use and threat of use of nuclear\r\nweapons. As another step, we reiterate the call for the\r\nconclusion of an international convention against the\r\nproduction and stockpiling of fissile materials.\r\nSir, last December in Bangkok, your Prime Minister\r\nand my President, together with the Heads of Government\r\nof the eight other countries of South-East Asia, signed the\r\nSouth east Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. We\r\nurge the nuclear-weapon States to commit themselves to\r\nrespect this Treaty’s provisions by adhering to its protocol.\r\nTogether with the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of\r\nTlatelolco), the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty\r\n(Treaty of Rarotonga), the Pelindaba Text of the African\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, and that for Antarctica,\r\nthe South-East Asian Treaty is a major step towards a\r\nsouthern hemisphere free of nuclear weapons. We support\r\nthe political linkage among these nuclear-free zones, as was\r\nrecently proposed.\r\nOf particular concern to us is the unacceptably large\r\nnumber of innocent persons, including a disproportionate\r\nnumber of young children, killed or maimed by landmines.\r\nThe Philippines has ratified the Convention and its Protocol\r\nrestricting the use of excessively injurious weapons,\r\nlandmines, booby traps and similar devices. We have joined\r\nthe move towards a global ban on anti-personnel mines.\r\nIn this spirit, President Ramos while on a visit last\r\nDecember to Cambodia, a country ravaged by landmines,\r\nordered the immediate destruction of the Claymore mines\r\nwhich were then still in the inventory of the armed forces\r\nof the Philippines. Compliance with the President’s\r\ninstructions has been completed.\r\nAnother potential threat to global and regional peace\r\nand security has been the developing scramble for\r\njurisdiction, resources and strategic position in the world’s\r\noceans. This has been strongly evident in the situation in\r\nthe South China Sea, which for the most part is surrounded\r\nby South-East Asian States.\r\nFortunately, the international community has had the\r\ncollective wisdom to agree on a set of rules, primarily in\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to\r\ngovern the use of the sea. Not least, the Convention\r\nsubjects maritime jurisdictions to the rule of law, defining\r\nthe nature and limits of those jurisdictions and providing\r\nthe legal framework for their establishment and for\r\nnegotiating settlements where they overlap.\r\nThe world is threatened not only by weapons of war\r\nand by disputes over territory, but also by mankind’s\r\nassault on the world’s fragile environment. The\r\nPhilippines is firmly committed to the protection of the\r\nenvironment within its national jurisdiction.\r\nEnvironmental protection is a vital consideration in the\r\napproval of major development projects. We shall\r\nconserve the ecological integrity of the Philippines\r\nexclusive economic zone as well as of its internal waters.\r\nAs an archipelagic country whose exclusive economic\r\nzone extends to a portion of the South China Sea, the\r\nPhilippines places particular importance on preserving the\r\necological integrity of that body of water, and would\r\nwelcome the sharing of knowledge and experience gained\r\nfrom efforts to protect the environment in similar bodies\r\nof water elsewhere in the world.\r\nA potential threat to the environment arises from the\r\ngrowing use of nuclear energy in the generation of\r\nelectricity. This growth has been particularly rapid in East\r\nAsia, producing nuclear waste with corresponding\r\nrapidity. While nuclear power is relatively clean as a\r\nsource of energy, accidents in the operation of nuclear\r\nplants and in the disposal of nuclear waste can cause\r\ndevastation for the environment as well as for human\r\nlives. Equally damaging is the reckless manner in which\r\ndecommissioned nuclear power plants and nuclear-\r\npowered vessels are discarded. It is time for the\r\ninternational community to address this burgeoning\r\nproblem with the seriousness and urgency that it deserves.\r\nLast May, President Ramos proposed the possible\r\norganization of ASIATOM, an international body to look\r\ninto this concern in East Asia and to devise measures to\r\ndeal with it.\r\nAlong with the breakup of empires, the dissolution\r\nof hostile alliances, and the spread of the spirit of\r\nreconciliation within and between nations, one salutary\r\nglobal development in recent years has been the\r\nestablishment of an international trading regime based on\r\nthe increasingly free exchange of goods and services. This\r\ndevelopment was made possible by the embrace by nearly\r\nall the world of market forces as the most efficient way\r\nof creating wealth for the world’s people.\r\nThe efficacy of this principle of international\r\neconomic relations has been demonstrated in South-East\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nAsia, where countries have opened up their markets to one\r\nanother, through the Free Trade Area of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations, and to the world for the benefit\r\nof all. Next month the Philippines will have the honour of\r\nhosting the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council (APEC), including an informal\r\nmeeting of leaders of the 18 participating economies on the\r\nPacific rim.\r\nAt that meeting, we will consolidate plans of\r\nindividual APEC economies into a coherent Manila action\r\nplan for APEC that will free up and ease trade, and that\r\nwill attain the target set for free trade by the year 2010 for\r\nthe developed participants and by 2020 for the developing\r\neconomies. The plan includes ways of engaging in\r\neconomic and technical cooperation, particularly in order to\r\nhelp the less developed economies to adjust to the free-\r\ntrade regime envisioned in APEC.\r\nA few weeks after the APEC meeting, the first\r\nMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization, to be\r\nheld in Singapore, will review the implementation of the\r\nUruguay Round agreements and seek to develop a work\r\nprogramme to sustain the momentum of global trade\r\nliberalization through further negotiations on specific\r\nsectors.\r\nThe Philippines is strongly committed to the opening\r\nup of its economy. In affirming this basic policy of our\r\ncountry, we must ask our economic partners, particularly\r\nthe developed ones, to desist from circumventing their own\r\ncommitments to a free international trading regime by\r\nproviding subsidies to their uncompetitive sectors and by\r\nextending them protection in the guise of labour rights or\r\nenvironmental conservation. We must reject this kind of\r\ntactic.\r\nWe must also urge that the subject and object of\r\ndevelopment — human beings, their welfare and dignity —\r\nnot be overlooked. We also believe that the status of\r\nwomen is central to both economic growth and human\r\ndevelopment. The Philippines therefore calls upon all of us\r\nto carry out effectively and in full the Platform of Action\r\nadopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women and to\r\ndevote adequate resources to make this possible.\r\nIn accordance with our convictions on the status and\r\nrights of women, validated at the Beijing conference, the\r\nPhilippines has actively pressed for international action to\r\ncombat those scourges that plague the human race: violence\r\nagainst women and trafficking in women and children.\r\nBecause of the international dimension of these blights on\r\nthe human condition, the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community must keep them high on the\r\ninternational agenda until the human race is freed of\r\nthem. The Philippines and other countries similarly\r\nsituated have a special concern for women migrant\r\nworkers because of their peculiar vulnerability to violence\r\nand abuse.\r\nThe Philippines’ stand on the rights of women and\r\nchildren rests on our people’s deep conviction of the\r\ninherent sacredness of the rights of all human persons,\r\nfamilies and communities everywhere on this planet —\r\ntheir rights to freedom, dignity, participation in their own\r\ngovernance and to development.\r\nOur lives, our well-being and our rights are\r\nconstantly threatened by the activities of transnational\r\ncriminal gangs. Some of these gangs traffic in drugs.\r\nSome steal and smuggle cars. Some deal in the illicit\r\nbuying and selling of arms. Others engage in terror for a\r\nvariety of causes. Still others traffic in women, children,\r\nor people eager for work.\r\nThe Philippines is prepared to consider the draft\r\nconvention proposed by Poland on measures to combat\r\norganized crime. We commend Poland for this timely\r\ninitiative.\r\nThe United Nations is the keystone of mankind’s\r\nefforts on behalf of disarmament, the rule of law in the\r\nworld’s oceans, the preservation of the Earth and its\r\nenvironment, economic and social development, the fight\r\nagainst organized crime, and the protection of human\r\nrights. Because of its central and growing importance in\r\nhuman affairs, the Philippines firmly believes that the\r\nUnited Nations must be constantly renewed and\r\ninvigorated to enable it to respond to the challenges that\r\nface each generation.\r\nThe Philippines favours the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council’s permanent membership through the\r\naddition of countries that are politically and economically\r\nable and willing to assume the responsibilities of such\r\nmembership. At the same time, we believe in greater\r\nrepresentation on the basis of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution. The various innovative proposals now on the\r\ntable deserve close examination. But the issue of\r\nmembership cannot be considered in isolation; it has to be\r\naddressed in the context of reform of the Security\r\nCouncil — reform towards greater transparency and\r\ndemocracy of its working methods and reform towards a\r\nmore balanced relationship with the General Assembly,\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nwhich must retain pre-eminence in the affairs of the United\r\nNations.\r\nHowever, no structural changes in the United Nations\r\nwill be effective unless it is assured of the necessary flow\r\nof financial resources. Our Organization, no matter how\r\nmuch reform takes place, can function effectively only if it\r\nknows with reasonable certainty whether and when it can\r\npay its staff and meet the other obligations arising from\r\noperations that, after all, are mandated, often unanimously,\r\nby the Member States themselves.\r\nSimple mathematical calculations will demonstrate that\r\nthe financial crisis of the United Nations cannot be eased\r\nunless we all comply with the financial obligations that we\r\nfreely undertook. We must pay our dues in full, on time\r\nand without conditions. Specifically, the United Nations can\r\nrest on fairly stable financial foundations if all of us pay\r\nour contributions to the regular budget for each year by the\r\nend of January of that year.\r\nThe Philippines favours a revision of the scale of\r\nassessments for United Nations contributions so as to\r\nreflect current political and economic circumstances.\r\nHowever, logic and consistency dictate that similar\r\nadjustments be made in the shares of the countries affected\r\nin the capitalization of the international financial\r\ninstitutions, including the World Bank and regional\r\ndevelopment banks such as the Asian Development Bank.\r\nThe world’s peace, stability and progress, and the\r\nwelfare and dignity of its inhabitants, depend in large\r\nmeasure on the United Nations — not on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral or the Secretariat alone. Although their role is\r\ncrucial, they depend above all on us, the Member States,\r\nwhich, together with our peoples, make up the United\r\nNations. We are the United Nations. Let us make it work.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and International Cooperation of Kenya, His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka.\r\nMr. Musyoka (Kenya): On behalf of the Government\r\nof Kenya, I should like to convey to you, Sir, my sincere\r\ncongratulations and best wishes on your unanimous election\r\nas President of this session of the Assembly. Your election\r\nto this high office is a fitting testimony to Malaysia’s\r\ncommitment to, and support for, the United Nations. Your\r\ncountry has been an ardent champion of the cause of\r\ndeveloping countries. I am confident that your sterling\r\nqualities and versatile diplomatic capabilities will steer this\r\nOrganization to greater heights.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who presided over the last\r\nsession with great skill and dedication.\r\nIn the same vein, allow me to reiterate my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for the\r\nable manner in which he has borne the mantle of this\r\nOrganization. We wish to commend him for his\r\nachievements during the last five years, despite the many\r\nobstacles that the Organization has faced.\r\nMr. Baumanis (Latvia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nSince its inception, the General Assembly has\r\nprovided Member States with the opportunity to exchange\r\nviews on issues of common concern to the international\r\ncommunity, with a view to securing a stable and peaceful\r\nworld. To this end, I wish to assure you, Sir, of Kenya’s\r\ncommitment and determination to work together with\r\nother Member States in order to realize the Organization’s\r\nideals and objectives. We believe that the success of the\r\nUnited Nations depends on the collective resolve of its\r\nMembers.\r\nThe international community still faces a number of\r\nconflicts that are of great concern, as they continue to\r\nundermine international peace and security. We are\r\npainfully reminded by history that good and evil coexist,\r\nand that without societal restraints, humanity is in eternal\r\ndanger. As we approach the twenty-first century, and with\r\nthe cold war behind us, the international community now\r\nfaces numerous new and complex challenges posed by\r\nglobalization, fragmentation, democratization and\r\nmarginalization. There is a need to redesign the\r\ninternational order to meet these challenges. In this\r\nregard, we welcome the recent initiatives by the\r\nOrganization to strengthen its conflict-prevention\r\nmechanisms and to promote preventive diplomacy and\r\nconfidence-building measures.\r\nThe scourge of armed conflicts in certain parts of\r\nAfrica constitutes one of the most urgent socio-political\r\nproblems facing the continent, resulting in a serious threat\r\nto security, social cohesion and economic progress. These\r\nconflicts have posed serious challenges primarily due to\r\nthe complexities associated with their internal character.\r\nInter- and intra-State conflicts have led to a multitude of\r\nproblems, including loss of life, destruction of property,\r\npoverty, ethnic tensions and underdevelopment in the\r\ncountries where they occur.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nThese conflicts have been compounded by natural\r\ncalamities resulting in a large number of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons. We wish to reiterate our call to the\r\ninternational community to increase its support in\r\nalleviating the suffering of these people.\r\nSince the inception of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) in 1963, we have witnessed no less than 20\r\nfull-fledged civil wars on the African continent. Over the\r\nyears, some of these wars have been resolved, while others\r\nhave intensified. We are pleased that peace has been\r\nachieved in most parts of Africa. Sadly, however, there are\r\nstill some intractable conflicts going on, notably in Burundi,\r\nthe Sudan, Somalia and Liberia.\r\nThe conflict in Burundi, with its accompanying ethnic\r\ncharacter, is of great concern to Kenya and the countries of\r\nthe subregion. The recent coup d’etat in that country, which\r\noverthrew a constitutionally established Government, has\r\ncompounded the political crisis. It negates the efforts of the\r\nOAU to bring to an end the era of military coups which\r\nhave bedeviled the continent and remains an obstacle to\r\nAfrica’s quest for peace and stability.\r\nIn their efforts to find a lasting political settlement, the\r\ncountries of the subregion — Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania,\r\nUganda, Zaire and Kenya — held a series of meetings\r\nculminating in the imposition of sanctions against that\r\nsisterly country. These sanctions are aimed at putting\r\npressure on the new regime to restore a democratically\r\nelected Assembly, unban political parties and enter into\r\nunconditional negotiations with all parties to the conflict.\r\nWhile we welcome the recent Security Council\r\nresolution on Burundi, we appeal to the Council to take\r\nmore decisive steps to ensure that the leaders in Burundi\r\ncomply with the peace initiative of the second regional\r\nsummit on Burundi held in Arusha. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation wishes to take this opportunity to commend the\r\nefforts of Julius Nyerere, former President of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, who continues to facilitate the peace\r\nprocess in Burundi. We take this opportunity to urge the\r\ninternational community to render support to these\r\nmeasures and initiatives.\r\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be worrisome.\r\nThe prolonged nature of this conflict, with its\r\naccompanying negative effects on the neighbouring\r\ncountries, remains a matter of great concern to my country.\r\nIt is now time for the international community to bring\r\npressure to bear on the Somali faction leaders to come to\r\nthe negotiating table and reach agreement that will, once\r\nand for all, relieve the agony and suffering of the Somali\r\npeople. Kenya will continue to provide its cooperation\r\nand support.\r\nWith respect to the search for a durable peace in the\r\nSudan, Kenya, as the Chairman of the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Drought and Development (IGADD)\r\nsubcommittee on the peace initiative on Sudan, is working\r\ntogether with the other member States to find appropriate\r\nremedies to the conflict. While there are no easy solutions\r\nto this conflict, the countries of the region, which remain\r\nseized of the matter, are hopeful that, through preventive\r\ndiplomacy, there will soon be an end to the atrocities and\r\nthat peace will be restored in the Sudan as well.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express the\r\nappreciation of my Government for the confidence the\r\nOAU has bestowed upon my country by endorsing Kenya\r\nas the sole candidate for the non-permanent seat in the\r\nSecurity Council allocated to Africa for the period\r\n1997-1998 at the elections to be held later this year. The\r\nelection of Kenya to the Council will provide us with the\r\nopportunity to contribute even further to the continued\r\nsearch for international peace and security.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nis a collective responsibility of us all. It was with this in\r\nmind that the General Assembly at its fiftieth session\r\nurged the Conference on Disarmament to conclude the\r\nnegotiations for a comprehensive and truly verifiable\r\ntreaty banning all nuclear testing. It was also with this\r\nunderstanding and expectation that Kenya and other\r\nAfrican countries affirmed their commitment to outlawing\r\nnuclear testing and the possession of nuclear weapons on\r\nthe African continent. Towards this end, the Pelindaba\r\nTreaty was signed in Cairo on 11 April 1996, declaring\r\nAfrica a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. We commend\r\nsimilar efforts that have been undertaken to declare other\r\nregions nuclear-free zones.\r\nKenya reaffirms its commitment to total nuclear\r\ndisarmament. There is no longer any justification for the\r\npossession of nuclear weapons nor for their testing. We\r\nmust work towards the achievement of the goal of\r\ncomplete elimination of all nuclear weapons within a\r\ngiven time-frame. Kenya therefore welcomes the recent\r\nconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty as an important step in this direction.\r\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play in\r\nconsensus- building in international economic cooperation.\r\nKenya is confident that the Organization will continue to\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nuphold its principles of universality, sovereignty and\r\nmultilateralism in its decisions and operational activities.\r\nWe are of the view that the United Nations should be\r\nstrengthened in order effectively to carry out its mandate\r\nand follow-up on the programmes of action that have been\r\nagreed upon at the various international conferences. The\r\ncontinuum of global conferences in recent years has\r\nenabled us to create a new vision of cooperation towards\r\nglobal development needs. Indeed, the most recent of these,\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\r\n(Habitat II), which took place in Istanbul, Turkey, endorsed\r\nthe need for quick action in addressing the dual objectives\r\nof adequate shelter for all and sustainable human\r\nsettlements. To realize these objectives, the Conference\r\ncalled for new and additional resources and for the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations Centre for Human\r\nSettlements in order for it effectively to carry out its\r\nmandate. In this context, Kenya believes that, for this to\r\nbecome a reality, international commitment is imperative.\r\nWe also view the World Food Summit to be held in\r\nRome this year as a major United Nations conference that\r\nwill address itself to the primary needs of mankind by\r\nensuring food security and sustainable development. We\r\nexpect the international community to render appropriate\r\nsupport in order to realize these objectives.\r\nWhile most developing countries continue in their\r\nstrenuous economic reform efforts, the question of the debt\r\nburden and debt servicing remains a major obstacle. Kenya\r\ncalls for an early consensus on debt relief, reduction and\r\npossible cancellation. It is expected that the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions will quickly conclude their consultations on the\r\nsteps to be taken to address the debt problem of developing\r\ncountries. These should include additional innovative\r\nmeasures that would provide social safety nets to vulnerable\r\ngroups, particularly children, women and the poor.\r\nMy own country, Kenya, under the leadership of\r\nPresident Daniel arap Moi, has undertaken far-reaching\r\npolitical and economic reforms. These reforms have been\r\nundertaken at painful costs and with adverse effects on the\r\npopulation. However, after suffering a decline in economic\r\ngrowth as a result of the stringent reform measures, our\r\neconomy is now on the path of recovery and has registered\r\na growth rate of between 5 and 6 per cent this year. The\r\nKenyan economy is now totally liberalized. All foreign\r\nexchange restrictions have been abolished, making Kenya\r\none of the most attractive investment destinations anywhere\r\nin the world. In order to achieve higher growth and to\r\nmaintain the development momentum, Kenya appeals for\r\nthe continued commitment, understanding and support of\r\nour development partners.\r\nWe are also committed to regional integration and\r\nthe widening of economic space, designed to integrate\r\nnational economies into formal groupings, centring on\r\ntrading blocs. The inauguration of the East African\r\nCooperation in Arusha early this year by the three Heads\r\nof State of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, marks an\r\nimportant milestone in our efforts towards political and\r\nsocio-economic integration. This arrangement, which\r\nbrings together a population of over 70 million people,\r\nhas created vast opportunities for investment in our\r\nsubregion. It also constitutes an important building block\r\ntowards the realization of the African economic\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe have also recently revitalized IGADD and\r\nexpanded its mandate to focus on issues of development\r\nand conflict prevention, management and resolution. The\r\nrevitalized IGADD will require full support from our\r\ndevelopment partners for a speedy implementation of the\r\nregional initiatives. In the wider subregion, the Common\r\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa continues to be\r\nthe main vehicle for regional integration in eastern and\r\nsouthern Africa.\r\nKenya’s greatest asset is its environment. The herds\r\nof wildlife which migrate through the plains, the\r\nmysterious forests, the snow-peaked mountains, the\r\nancient lakes and the extraordinary landscapes of the\r\nGreat Rift Valley have attracted generations of visitors\r\nand have become to many a symbol of the beauty and\r\npurity of the African continent. Throughout the world,\r\nspace is being taken up for development purposes by\r\nexpanding populations. Inappropriate land practices run\r\ncounter to the conservation of natural resources. Precious\r\nspecies are becoming either endangered or indeed extinct.\r\nIn Kenya, our policies have been designed to\r\npreserve the environment as a common heritage for\r\nmankind. We have resisted all pressures against\r\nconservation and have created a sanctuary for a great\r\nvariety of biodiversity in all its grandeur. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment of Kenya has recently initiated major\r\ninnovative steps that will ensure the protection of the\r\necosystem for the enjoyment of future generations. These\r\ninclude public awareness, environmental education, and,\r\nmost importantly, the Great Rift Valley Conservancy\r\nProgramme, which will ensure integrated utilization of\r\nland. We wish to appeal to the international community\r\nto make available the necessary resources to augment\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nsuch efforts, in order to realize the objective of sustainable\r\ndevelopment as called for in Agenda 21.\r\nIn the face of the complex nature of emerging\r\nproblems in the world today, the demands on the United\r\nNations continue to increase as Member States expect more\r\nand more from it. The pressures of facilitating conflict\r\nresolution and peacekeeping, promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment and combating social problems associated with\r\npoverty, disease and famine, have made the demands even\r\nmore urgent.\r\nWe therefore welcome efforts to reform the United\r\nNations so that it can serve the interests of Member States\r\nmore effectively. However, as the United Nations continues\r\nin its reform endeavours, the General Assembly must be\r\ngiven greater visibility and authority. The Security Council\r\nmust be reformed to reflect the principles of democracy,\r\ntransparency and equitable representation. My delegation\r\nwishes to urge Member States to exercise greater flexibility\r\non the various innovative positions with regard to reform of\r\nthe Security Council in order to reach an early consensus.\r\nSimilarly, in undertaking financial reforms, bold and\r\npractical measures are necessary to ensure adequate and\r\npredictable resources. The obligation of Member States to\r\npay their assessed contributions for the regular and\r\npeacekeeping budgets, in full, on time and without\r\nconditions, cannot be overemphasized.\r\nWe wish to underscore that reform cannot be an end\r\nin itself but must be seen as a necessary tool for enabling\r\nthe Organization to achieve its objectives in a more\r\nefficient and cost-effective manner.\r\nWe welcome the recent arrangements to establish\r\nNairobi as the location of one of the four United Nations\r\nCentres — the only one in the whole of the developing\r\nworld. We regret, however, that the two United Nations\r\nprogrammes with their Headquarters in Nairobi continue to\r\nsuffer from lack of adequate funding and capacity\r\nunderutilization, despite their enormous potential.\r\nThe recent tendency to locate environment-related\r\nsecretariats away from Nairobi has had a negative effect on\r\nthe strengthening of the Centre and should be discouraged.\r\nWe are convinced that institutional linkage is a vital\r\ncomponent for the enhancement of efficiency and capacity-\r\nutilization of the limited resources. In this respect, Kenya\r\nwishes to record its appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor holding the meeting of the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination in Nairobi in April 1996 — a first for the\r\ndeveloping world. We in Africa were particularly proud to\r\nhost that high-level meeting, which took place\r\nimmediately after the Secretary-General launched the\r\nUnited Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa.\r\nFinally, we wish to take this opportunity to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, for initiating far-reaching reforms within the\r\nUnited Nations system since his assumption of the high\r\noffice of chief executive of the Organization. My\r\ndelegation wishes to express its satisfaction at his untiring\r\nefforts to steer the Organization to greater heights as we\r\nmove into the next century.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nMr. Farouk Al-Shara’.\r\nMr. Al-Shara’ (Syrian Arab Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): It is my pleasure to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession, and to congratulate his friendly country,\r\nMalaysia, on his election to that high international post.\r\nWe are confident that his political experience and\r\ndiplomatic skill will lead to the success of this session’s\r\ndeliberations. May I also extend our thanks to his\r\npredecessor for conducting the work of the fiftieth session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nOn this occasion, we should like to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts to\r\nenhance the role of the United Nations, and our concern\r\nthat his international standing, and his mandate under the\r\nCharter be respected. We also believe that the common\r\ninterest of Member States requires the support of his\r\ncandidature for a second term.\r\nWe live in a region which, because of the injustice,\r\noccupation and aggression it has witnessed for decades,\r\nhas had more than its share of victims of wars and\r\nviolence. It was impossible to envisage a solution to end\r\nsuch tragedies and to respond to the aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the region as long as the Arab-Israeli conflict\r\ncontinued to prevail in the absence of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace.\r\nMany people do not know how many international\r\nendeavours were made, how many meetings were\r\nconvened, how many parties contributed, how many\r\nletters were sent and assurances given before agreement\r\nwas reached between the parties on the foundations and\r\nrules that made up the terms of reference of the Madrid\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nPeace Conference. It is now five years since the Madrid\r\nConference was convened and, in turn, bilateral negotiations\r\nset up. Those negotiations survived various periods of\r\ntension, interruption, set-back — and progress. They\r\ngenerated thousands of pages of records. Both Syria and\r\nIsrael agreed on Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan back to\r\nthe boundary of 4 June 1967. Negotiations then proceeded\r\nto the other elements of peace — all under the supervision\r\nof the United States of America, and with its participation.\r\nNow, after all those international efforts, which were\r\nunprecedented in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a\r\nnew Government has taken office in Israel. It has set itself\r\nthe opposite course to that of its predecessor, and has\r\ndeclared “no” three times: no to withdrawal from the\r\nGolan; no to withdrawal from occupied Palestinian lands;\r\nand no to a Palestinian State.\r\nTo anyone who has followed the declarations and\r\npractices of the Israeli Government since it assumed power,\r\nit is clear that it has not wasted a single opportunity to\r\nunderline its insistence on changing the foundations and\r\nrules of the peace process, to attempt to demolish all the\r\nachievements of the past five years and to call for a return\r\nto negotiations from square one, without preconditions —\r\nin other words, without the Madrid terms of reference, in\r\naccordance with the “peace for peace” formula, with the\r\nobjective of imposing its fait accompli on the Arabs.\r\nPresident Hafez Al-Assad has said:\r\n“If this is what the Israeli Prime Minister has in\r\nmind, why should Syria want peace? If peace does not\r\nreturn the land to its rightful owners, why should we\r\ncall for it? Can any thinking person in this world\r\nexpect Syria to establish peace with the Israeli\r\nGovernment while Syrian land remains in Israeli\r\nhands? That is why I say that if Netanyahu stays that\r\ncourse, I do not believe there is any window for a just\r\nand comprehensive peace in the region.”\r\nOne of the dilemmas facing the Middle East peace\r\nprocess is that certain Israeli leaders are encouraging, rather\r\nthan discouraging, extremism in Israeli society. They are\r\nthe ones who add fuel to the fire whenever a better climate\r\nfor the achievement of peace begins to develop. There are\r\nmany examples of such an attitude, which we do not have\r\ntime to provide today. It is sufficient to recall that in the\r\naftermath of the Hebron massacre voices were raised\r\neverywhere, even in Israel itself, calling for the Jewish\r\nsettlers, who number less than 400, to move from the heart\r\nof Hebron, which is home to more than 120,000\r\nPalestinians. However, the Israeli Government refused to\r\nwithdraw from Hebron, portraying such a move as the\r\nultimate painful concession.\r\nThe bloody confrontations that broke out following\r\nthe opening of the tunnel that Israel dug under the wall of\r\nthe Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as previous deliberate Israeli\r\nprovocations and the unjustified escalation of tensions\r\nagainst Syria and Lebanon over the past few weeks, all\r\nconfirm that the Israeli Government did not take office in\r\norder to resume peace negotiations on the basis of\r\ninternational legitimacy, the Madrid terms of reference\r\nand the “land-for-peace” formula, but rather in order to\r\nlaunch new negotiations with no terms of reference,\r\nentrenching a fait accompli.\r\nDuring his European tour, Prime Minister Netanyahu\r\nannounced that his decision to open the tunnel was\r\ndesigned merely to ease the movement of tourists and\r\nspare them a walk of a few dozen extra metres. Imagine\r\nhow guilty those tourists would feel if they believed that,\r\nin order to secure their comfort, the Israeli authorities\r\nkilled about 80 Palestinians, caused the deaths of 15\r\nIsraelis, and wounded more than a thousand people. They\r\nwould not, of course, believe it; we do not believe it —\r\nand neither does the head of the Israeli Government, who\r\nrevealed his true expansionist intentions when he later\r\nclaimed that the tunnel had been there for two thousand\r\nyears, and arrogantly declared that it would remain open\r\nfor ever.\r\nPerhaps the huge number of innocent victims who\r\nfell in Jerusalem and in the towns of the West Bank and\r\nGaza have hastened the unmasking of such deceit. In this\r\nway the Israeli Government appears to public opinion as\r\nit truly is: neither desirous of a just peace nor keen to\r\npursue it. This was reflected in the statements made by\r\nmany Foreign Ministers in the Security Council, where\r\nIsrael appeared totally isolated, besieged on all sides by\r\nstatements deploring and denouncing its action, with the\r\nvoices that usually volunteer to defend it dying away.\r\nThe Israeli Government’s fuelling of extremism did\r\nnot stop there. General Sharon, the Israeli Minister for\r\nInfrastructure, issued a decision last week allocating three\r\nnew sites on the occupied Syrian Golan for building 600\r\nhousing units. Perhaps a large segment of international\r\npublic opinion and some politicians are not aware that\r\nwithout the financial aid and huge governmental subsidies\r\ngiven to Jewish settlers, they would not settle in the\r\nGolan, especially as they are well aware that the Golan is\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nSyrian territory, which they will have to leave sooner or\r\nlater.\r\nGiven my comments, it might be concluded that the\r\nIsraeli Government has no strategy for peace but has, it\r\nseems, chosen the path of confrontation. The path of\r\nconfrontation, however, is very costly for several reasons.\r\nFirst, Israel can start a war whenever it chooses, but cannot\r\nend it when it chooses. Israel might wreak considerable\r\ndestruction here and there, but it can never destroy the will\r\nof a nation that has deep roots of civilization which spread\r\nall over the world. Many Israelis may be unaware that all\r\nthe wars they have fought between October 1973 and April\r\n1996 have gained them nothing except human and political\r\nlosses and further international condemnation.\r\nSecondly, the path of confrontation is very costly\r\nbecause the international community rejects war and\r\naggression and calls for the achievement of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. Israel knows that\r\nthe Arabs have opted for peace as their strategic option,\r\nincluding at the summit level. In taking this stand they have\r\nbeen supported by the summit of the States of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, the summit of the European Union and\r\nthe summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries, all\r\nof which have stressed the need to adhere to the\r\nfoundations of the peace process, relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions and the “land-for-peace” formula, as well as\r\nrespect by the parties for the agreements and commitments\r\nreached so far.\r\nGiven these facts, it would be unacceptable if peace\r\nwere not also a strategic option for Israel — indeed, it\r\nwould be a real catastrophe. The achievement of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace, to which the peoples of the region\r\nand the world aspire, requires Israel’s withdrawal from all\r\noccupied Arab land, pursuant to Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nSyria reaffirms its attachment to the unity of both the\r\nterritory and the people of Iraq. Syria rejects any attempt to\r\nviolate the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq’s territory\r\nor to interfere in its internal affairs, including the attempt\r\nto establish a so-called security zone in northern Iraq. Syria\r\nalso calls for an end to the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi\r\npeople, and for a continuation of the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including a solution to the\r\nissue of Kuwaiti detainees.\r\nWith regard to the Lockerbie crisis, Syria expresses its\r\nconcern for the human and material harm that has been\r\ndone to the brotherly people of Libya as a result of the\r\ncontinuing coercive measures imposed on them by the\r\nSecurity Council. Syria reaffirms the statement made in\r\nthe final declaration on the issue of the recent Arab\r\nsummit, and calls for a response to the initiative\r\nsubmitted by the Arab League for solving this crisis.\r\nSyria hopes that the United Arab Emirates and the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran can find a peaceful solution to\r\nthe crisis over the three islands in a way that will\r\npreserve good-neighbourly relations and contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of security and stability in the region.\r\nSyria expresses its support for the principles agreed\r\nupon by the Governments of Yemen and Eritrea for a\r\nsolution to their conflict through international arbitration.\r\nOur position flows from our desire for good-neighbourly\r\nrelations between them and our belief in the importance\r\nof re-establishing security and stability in the Red Sea\r\nregion.\r\nSyria also expresses its concern at the continuing\r\ndeterioration of the situation in Somalia and reiterates the\r\ncall of the Arab summit to the leaders of the Somali\r\nfactions to achieve national reconciliation and to work\r\ntowards the establishment of a national authority\r\nrepresenting our brothers, the Somali people, as a whole.\r\nWith regard to Korea, Syria expresses its support for\r\nmeasures that would guarantee peace and stability in the\r\nKorean peninsula and for the aspirations of the Korean\r\npeople to reunification.\r\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations provided an important\r\nopportunity for us to forge a common vision of the future\r\nof international relations. On that occasion, we said that\r\nthe crisis facing the United Nations does not arise from\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter, but rather from\r\nthe United Nations decision-making mechanism and the\r\nselective way in which decisions are implemented. We\r\nalso observed that the Organization’s serious financial\r\ncrisis is, in fact, merely the reflection of a political crisis\r\nthat essentially revolves around the identity of the United\r\nNations and its role in the post-cold-war era.\r\nIn the light of those comments, the obvious question\r\nis: Will it be possible to introduce meaningful reforms\r\ninto the structure of the United Nations that are\r\nacceptable and satisfactory to Member States? That is the\r\ntrue challenge, requiring that we all strive to strengthen\r\ndialogue and international cooperation. This will ensure\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nthat reforms take place which fulfil, in substance and in\r\nform, the aspirations of Member States.\r\nToday, as we stand on the threshold of the next\r\ncentury, we are all faced with serious challenges that\r\nrequire us to create an environment that will allow future\r\ngenerations to live in peace, security and cooperation within\r\na system of international relations free from violence and\r\nconfrontation. That is the hope of our peoples. This is what\r\nwe must endeavour to achieve as we look forward to a\r\nbetter future, one both more just and more humane that will\r\nbenefit all mankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Bulgaria, Mr. Georgi Pirinski.\r\nMr. Pirinksi (Bulgaria): A year ago this month, the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted by acclamation the Declaration\r\non the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United\r\nNations. Thus, the special commemorative session of the\r\nAssembly, attended by 128 Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, solemnly reaffirmed our commitment to the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. As Ambassador\r\nButler of Australia, the Chairman of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee, stated, that Declaration must serve as a set of\r\nguidelines for cooperation amongst all nations in the years\r\nahead.\r\nThe fiftieth session, so ably presided over by\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, took the initial\r\nstep towards translating these new guidelines into practical\r\naction aimed at the twenty-first century. In congratulating\r\nMr. Razali Ismail upon his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, I wish him every\r\nsuccess in his highly responsible mission to carry further\r\nthe new tasks and endeavours of the Organization in the\r\ncourse of this session.\r\nLast year’s Declaration spelt out four main areas for\r\naction in fulfilment of the mission of the United Nations in\r\nthe coming decades: peace, development, equality and\r\njustice. The world of the twenty-first century will confront\r\ntwo great opposing forces: globalization and fragmentation.\r\nBulgaria, as an active member of the international\r\ncommunity, has felt both the new opportunities and the new\r\nrisks. In developing its policies and responses, Bulgaria has\r\nproceeded on the basis of its European identity, particularly\r\nits association with and prospective membership of the\r\nEuropean Union. I would therefore like to state that we\r\nshare in and attach importance to the European Union\r\nmemorandum to this session and to the statement delivered\r\nby Mr. Dick Spring on behalf of the Union.\r\nWith the transition from the post-war bipolar system\r\nto a world of multi-centrism, the regional format will\r\nacquire ever-growing importance. This has been our\r\nexperience in the Balkans, at least, a region which has\r\nsustained the full blast of the forces of both globalization\r\nand disastrous fragmentation.\r\nIn line with its consistently maintained positions,\r\nBulgaria welcomed from the outset the Dayton and Paris\r\nagreements. We provided observers as well as police\r\npersonnel to the international missions in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. The recent elections in that country,\r\nnotwithstanding their deficiencies and problems, represent\r\na vitally important step forward. They opened the way for\r\nyesterday’s welcome and important Security Council\r\nresolution to lift the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia.\r\nAt the same time, even during the active phase of\r\nthe conflict, we have worked for the promotion of the\r\npositive trends of good-neighbourliness throughout the\r\nregion. At last year’s fiftieth session, the Prime Minister\r\nof Bulgaria highlighted this priority feature of Bulgaria’s\r\nforeign policy, favouring comprehensive regional\r\ncooperation. In particular he stated our intention to\r\nconvene a meeting of Central and South-East European\r\nStates in order to examine a broad range of issues\r\nconcerning long-term stability, security and cooperation\r\nthroughout the region.\r\nToday, it is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that\r\nsuch a meeting took place in Sofia on 6 and 7 July 1996\r\nat foreign ministerial level. At that meeting, seven\r\ncountries — Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,\r\nGreece, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia — adopted a\r\ncomprehensive document, the Sofia Declaration on Good-\r\nNeighbourly Relations, Stability, Security and\r\nCooperation in the Balkans.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe text of the Declaration was duly circulated as an\r\nofficial document of the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council. The Declaration was fully supported by\r\nall participants in the broader format of the Sofia\r\nministerial meeting, including representatives from\r\nCroatia, Slovenia, Italy, Hungary, and the five Contact\r\nGroup countries — Germany, France, the Russian\r\nFederation, the United Kingdom and the United States of\r\nAmerica; Ireland, which holds the presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union; representatives of countries chairing the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Central European Initiative, Black Sea\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nEconomic Cooperation; and high-level representatives from\r\nthe United Nations, the European Commission, the Council\r\nof Europe, the United Nations Economic Commission for\r\nEurope, the World Bank and the European Bank for\r\nReconstruction and Development. The High Representative,\r\nMr. Carl Bildt, was also present, took part in the meeting\r\nand made a valuable contribution to its success.\r\nI should like to outline very briefly the main spheres\r\nof activity launched at the meeting in Sofia in July. In the\r\nfirst area — enhancing regional peace and stability, and\r\nbuilding confidence and good-neighbourliness — the point\r\nof departure was for the countries in the region to reaffirm\r\ntheir allegiance to the fundamental principles of inter-State\r\nrelations as spelt out by the Charter, as well as in Helsinki\r\nand Paris.\r\nIn line with these principles, Bulgaria has been\r\nactively promoting confidence-building with all its\r\nneighbours and has already concluded agreements to this\r\neffect with Turkey, Greece and Romania. We stand ready\r\nto enter into such agreements with our other neighbours, as\r\nwell as on a multilateral regional basis.\r\nAnother important step in this direction will be the\r\nconvening in Sofia of a meeting of Ministers of Defence as\r\nprovided for in the Declaration of the Balkan countries.\r\nThis meeting should contribute significantly towards\r\nstrengthening security, enhancing confidence and\r\nconsidering future arms-control measures in the region.\r\nRecent regional multilateral cooperation in South-East\r\nEurope has focused on infrastructure development and\r\nupgrading as important factors for economic growth and\r\nregional stability. There is an emerging consensus that it\r\nshould be oriented towards upgrading and linking local\r\ninfrastructures with trans-European ones, as well as with\r\nthose in other adjacent areas — the eastern Mediterranean,\r\nnorthern Africa and across the Black Sea and into Asia.\r\nTransport infrastructure development is the subject of local\r\ncooperation between Albania, the Republic of Macedonia\r\nand Bulgaria, with direct financial and technical assistance\r\nbeing provided by the United States of America; a\r\nquadrilateral agreement has recently been signed with\r\nregard to this matter. It is also the subject of trilateral\r\ncooperation between Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. An\r\nimportant contribution to the cause of good-neighbourliness\r\nand infrastructure development are the Bulgarian-Greek\r\ncross-border cooperation and water-sharing agreements,\r\nwhich recently entered into force and will be submitted to\r\nthe OSCE under the Pact on Stability in Europe.\r\nFurthermore, in accordance with the agreement\r\nbetween the Balkan countries, the Bulgarian Government\r\nbegan preliminary consultations towards setting up a\r\ntransregional information and contacts centre for\r\ninfrastructure development. We expect further\r\ncontributions to be made to the positive developments in\r\nthis field from the forthcoming meeting of Ministers of\r\nTransportation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nand Central European Initiative partner countries in Sofia\r\nin November 1996.\r\nTogether with its neighbours in South-East Europe,\r\nBulgaria is building regional cooperation on the basis of\r\nthe rule of law and full respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, including those of persons\r\nbelonging to different national, ethnic, religious and\r\ncultural minorities. The countries from the region once\r\nagain reaffirmed their commitment to these principles and\r\nvalues. They also adopted specific guidelines in the\r\nvarious areas of cultural contacts and cooperation through\r\nexchanges and joint programmes. These should add to\r\nexisting bilateral or multilateral programmes that promote\r\nbetter mutual understanding and the overcoming of\r\nnegative stereotypes inherited from the past.\r\nJoint action in the field of crime prevention and the\r\nelimination of international terrorism envisages closer\r\ncooperation between central, regional and border\r\nauthorities through efficient communications and\r\nexchange of information; a commitment to accede to all\r\nrelevant international conventions that prevent and punish\r\ninternational crime and terrorism; joining and participation\r\nin specialized regional forums for discussing the problems\r\nof illicit drug-trafficking, organized crime and regional\r\nanti-terrorist cooperation; and the elaboration of a regional\r\nprogramme to combat organized crime. This already\r\nrepresents a tangible contribution to the implementation\r\nat the regional level of a zero-tolerance approach to\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Sofia Declaration thus set out both the\r\nframework and the terms of reference for comprehensive\r\nregional cooperation. To this end, follow-up activities are\r\nbeing elaborated in all areas and we hope that all States\r\nfrom the region will take part at the next ministerial\r\nmeeting in Greece in 1997.\r\nProposals on cooperation in South-East Europe have\r\nalso come from outside the region. The Florence\r\nconference of the Peace Implementation Council last June\r\nidentified the three initiatives fostering such cooperation:\r\nthe Balkan conference initiated by the Bulgarian\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nGovernment, the stability process under the terms of the\r\nRoyaumont declaration of 12 December 1995 and the\r\nSouth-East Europe cooperation initiative of the United\r\nStates Government. There is important potential for\r\ninteraction between the three initiatives, with the process\r\nlaunched in Sofia serving as a comprehensive basis which\r\ncould link up with the other two initiatives in specific areas\r\nof common interest.\r\nThis regional endeavour represents an integral building\r\nblock in the development of an all-European system of\r\nsecurity and cooperation. We expect the Lisbon OSCE\r\nsummit in December 1996 to address in a comprehensive\r\nmanner this set of issues and provide guidelines for future\r\naction at both the European and regional levels. Various\r\nbodies and agencies of the United Nations system, such as\r\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Environment Programme, the Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs, the United Nations Crime Prevention and\r\nCriminal Justice Branch and other bodies could also be\r\nhighly effective in encouraging and promoting at the\r\nregional level the ideas and initiatives that I have outlined.\r\nI would like to state Bulgaria’s position on some\r\nUnited Nations-led and other major endeavours at the\r\nglobal level. We fully share the view that the recent\r\nconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nis an achievement of truly historic proportions. In pursuit of\r\nBulgaria’s long-standing policies in favour of nuclear arms\r\ncontrol and disarmament, I had the honour to sign this\r\nTreaty on the very first day it was opened for signature. For\r\nBulgaria, a convention on the ban on the production of\r\nfissionable material for military purposes would be the next\r\nlogical stage in the work of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, in which Bulgaria is an active participant.\r\nFrom the point of view of global as well as regional\r\nsecurity, another priority task is the early entry into force\r\nand implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nAs for the Biological Weapons Convention, Bulgaria is\r\nfully in favour of upgrading its control and verification\r\nmechanism and is ready to contribute to this end at the\r\nforthcoming Review Conference and thereafter.\r\nBulgaria took an active part in the Review Conference\r\nof the States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or\r\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons\r\nWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to\r\nHave Indiscriminate Effects, and its Protocol II. During the\r\nnegotiations, we made special efforts to take into\r\nconsideration the new technical requirements on mines as\r\nan absolute prerequisite for the purposes of mine-\r\nclearance and the normal conduct of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Furthermore,\r\nby a decision taken on 2 May 1996, the Bulgarian\r\nGovernment imposed a three-year ban on exports of anti-\r\npersonnel mines. Bulgaria, which currently hold the\r\nchairmanship of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, attaches particular importance, together\r\nwith the other United Nations Member States, to the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the review of\r\nthe follow-up process to the United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.\r\nIn October 1995, Sofia hosted the third Ministerial\r\nConference on Environment for Europe. The Conference\r\nprovided further impetus to the Environmental Action\r\nProgramme for Central and Eastern Europe. The\r\nministerial declaration adopted is an important document\r\nin the field of environmental protection in Europe and a\r\nfurther step towards implementing the global concept of\r\nsustainability.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed rapid changes in\r\nthe world economy, changes that can be described by the\r\ngeneral trends of liberalization and globalization, both of\r\nwhich are important factors for development. I am happy\r\nto inform this Assembly that, after long years of\r\nstrenuous negotiations, today, 2 October 1996, Bulgaria\r\nis becoming a member of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO). By joining WTO, Bulgaria shall become fully\r\nintegrated into the world trading system which is essential\r\nfor us to be able to achieve stable economic growth.\r\nBearing in mind the new challenges in the social and\r\neconomic areas in today’s multipolar and interdependent\r\nworld, my country supports the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to enhance and streamline United Nations\r\nactivities in this field.\r\nBulgaria is a party to all major international human-\r\nrights instruments. We believe that international\r\ncooperation in the field of human rights is essential for\r\ntheir implementation. It should be conducted in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of international law, such as the sovereign\r\nequality, political independence and the territorial integrity\r\nof States. We are in favour of constructive and open\r\ndialogue on even sensitive issues related to human rights\r\nin individual States. This approach is not directed against\r\nany country. The situations in different parts of the world\r\nshould be examined in a way that takes into account the\r\nspecific characteristics of individual countries in a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\ncomprehensive context and be aimed above all at\r\nencouraging positive developments and tendencies.\r\nTransnational crime and international terrorism are\r\nincreasingly emerging, as stated by many speakers in this\r\nforum, as one of the major security challenges facing the\r\ninternational community today. They directly affect\r\ndevelopment and quality of life and erode the very\r\nfoundations of democratic society. It has become more than\r\nobvious that these challenges cannot be addressed\r\neffectively by national institutions alone. Today, there is a\r\npressing need to develop new cooperation in the field of\r\ncrime prevention and criminal justice. Such cooperation\r\ncould also include more information sharing, including\r\ninputs from intelligence sources.\r\nAt this session, the General Assembly must carefully\r\nexamine all valuable ideas and proposals in this field put\r\nforward by preceding speakers. My country will readily\r\nsupport the efforts of the international community aimed at\r\nthe elaboration, on a global level, of efficient measures to\r\ncombat crime and to eliminate international terrorism.\r\nAllow me to digress for a moment from the prepared\r\ntext of my speech in order to share with the Assembly a\r\nmost regrettable and tragic piece of news concerning a\r\npolitical assassination which took place just over 24 hours\r\nago in Sofia. The target was a former Prime Minister of\r\nBulgaria, Mr. Andrei Lukanov. I would like to inform the\r\nAssembly that Mr. Lukanov was one of the principal and\r\npersonal driving forces behind the democratic changes that\r\ntook place in Bulgaria after 1989. He staked his personal\r\nefforts and future on the successful introduction into\r\nBulgarian society of the values of democracy, the\r\npromotion of human rights and economic reform. He was\r\nalso well-known within the United Nations family, in\r\nparticular in Geneva, having been an active promoter of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\nsince its early years and having promoted Bulgaria’s\r\nparticipation in the world trading system and the General\r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. In an ironic twist of fate,\r\ntoday marks, as I said, Bulgaria’s accession to WTO.\r\nThe Bulgarian Parliament adopted a declaration on this\r\noccasion several hours ago. It firmly declares the will of all\r\npolitical forces in Bulgaria — Mr. Lukanov having been an\r\nactive member of Parliament for the last seven years — not\r\nto permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the\r\npath towards economic and political reform or to infringe\r\non the peaceful and lawful process of political and public\r\nlife, including the forthcoming presidential elections at the\r\nend of this month.\r\nI have instructed my Mission to transmit the text of\r\nthis declaration, with a short covering note, to you,\r\nMr. President, the Secretary-General and Member States.\r\nI invite all of you to share our feelings of support and\r\nsympathy for the family of Mr. Lukanov and to send\r\nmessages of support to the Bulgarian Parliament. I invite\r\nthe Assembly, at this point in time, without rising, to\r\nshare a minute of silence in remembrance of\r\nMr. Lukanov.\r\nImprovements in the effectiveness and functioning of\r\nthe principal organs, a better balance in their authority\r\nand the streamlining of the subsidiary machinery are\r\nimportant conditions for the reform of the United Nations.\r\nThe issue of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council is a key\r\ncomponent of this process. We share the view that some\r\nMember States — developed, for instance Germany and\r\nJapan, and developing alike — are able to assume the\r\nresponsibility of permanent membership. A number of\r\nproposals for the reform of the Security Council have\r\nalready been put on the table and should be examined\r\nwith due attention. In this respect, I would like to mention\r\nthe valuable ideas presented by Minister Lamberto Dini\r\nof Italy just a few days ago. One of the major\r\ndevelopments over the past several years has been the fact\r\nthat the number of States in the Eastern European Group\r\nhas almost doubled. We reiterate our conviction that such\r\na rise in membership requires one additional non-\r\npermanent seat to be allocated to this Group. Some\r\nBalkan countries have already indicated their willingness\r\nto apply for non-permanent membership in the Security\r\nCouncil. With its consistent regional policies of good-\r\nneighbourliness and cooperation in South-East Europe, as\r\nwell as in the broader United Nations framework,\r\nBulgaria is equally justified in seeking membership on the\r\nCouncil in the years to come.\r\nIt would be remiss of me, however, not to mention\r\nsome serious flaws in the United Nations peacemaking\r\nmachinery. The question of finding an adequate solution\r\nto the complicated problems arising for third countries as\r\na result of United Nations Security Council-imposed\r\nsanctions is one of them. At its fiftieth session the\r\nGeneral Assembly once again expressed concern at the\r\npersisting special economic problems confronting States\r\naffected by sanctions implementation. It also renewed its\r\ninvitation to the international financial institutions to\r\ncontinue to pay special attention to these problems and\r\ntheir adverse social impact, and to consider ways and\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nmeans for mobilizing and providing resources on\r\nappropriate terms for mitigating the negative impact of the\r\nsanctions on those States. The Assembly also renewed its\r\nrequest to the competent organs, programmes and\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations to take into\r\nconsideration the special needs of the affected States and to\r\nconsider providing assistance to them from their special\r\nprogramme resources.\r\nRegrettably, few are the practical steps in\r\nimplementing these recommendations. These problems,\r\nsince they are long-lasting, will continue to exert their\r\nnegative impact long after the lifting of sanctions. It would\r\nbe highly counterproductive if the peacemaking essence of\r\nsanctions were to be distorted by major economic\r\ndislocation in affected third States. Being among the\r\ncountries suffering most from the implementation of\r\nsanctions, at this session Bulgaria will again submit a draft\r\nresolution on the subject and I invite all Member States to\r\ngive it their unanimous and firm support.\r\nThe proceedings of the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly provide new, important opportunities to\r\ncontinue on the path of reform and increased efficiency.\r\nThey open up new opportunities to render support to those\r\ntrends in the modern world, our global village and each of\r\nits neighbourhoods, making for societies with greater\r\nsecurity and promise in which our children can look\r\nforward to a more fulfilling life. Bulgaria is firmly\r\ncommitted to contributing actively and in a constructive\r\nspirit to the accomplishment of this new mission of the\r\nworld Organization.\r\nThe President: I share in the shock and sorrow over\r\nthe loss of a great Bulgarian leader and nationalist.\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet\r\nNam, His Excellency Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Manh Cam (Viet Nam) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist\r\nRepublic of Viet Nam, I would like to congratulate you\r\nwarmly, Sir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. We are truly proud that\r\nyou, an experienced representative of Malaysia, a member\r\ncountry of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), have been elected to this important position. We\r\nare confident that, under your guidance, our session will\r\nachieve many fine results.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to express our high\r\nappreciation of the performance of your predecessor,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral. We also hold in high\r\nregard the dynamism and perseverance of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the service of our\r\ncommon cause.\r\nLast year at this time, we had the opportunity to take\r\na retrospective look at the world’s development over the\r\npast half-century and the role played by the United\r\nNations in this long journey. One year later, the world\r\nlandscape is still full of contrasts, interwoven with factors\r\nand trends of hope and with events and tendencies that\r\ngive rise to the concerns of the international community\r\nat this end of the twentieth century.\r\nIn a world of teeming changes, what emerges as\r\ninvariable are the legitimate aspiration and vigorous\r\ndetermination of nations to achieve peace and\r\ndevelopment based on equality, democracy, respect for\r\nthe independence and sovereignty of each country and the\r\nidentity of each nation. In this grand endeavour, peoples\r\nturn to the United Nations for timely support and fruitful\r\nassistance because the Organization, having waded\r\nthrough the vicissitudes of a half-century of history, has\r\nbeen daily affirming its crucial role for the world as a\r\nwhole. Today’s challenge for our world Organization is\r\nhow to reform and adapt itself to the new international\r\ncircumstances in order to meet the expectations of the\r\npeoples.\r\nAs the system of international relations in the post-\r\ncold-war era takes shape, we can already see its trend\r\ntowards diversification and multicentrism. In this context,\r\nmultilateral institutions and mechanisms, especially the\r\nUnited Nations, have assumed an ever-more essential role.\r\nHowever, there are various ways of interpreting the role\r\nof our Organization today. As regards the vast majority of\r\nthe Member countries, the United Nations, in its capacity\r\nas a centre for harmonizing inter-State relations, should\r\nplay a fundamental role in firmly defending international\r\nlaw and in encouraging States’ strict and consistent\r\nrespect for and observation of the United Nations Charter.\r\nIn this spirit, the United Nations must use its weight and\r\nresponsibility to stem the practices — such as coercion\r\nand imposition, arbitrary embargo and sanctions that bring\r\nsuffering to innocent people, and flagrant interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of States, in violation of their\r\nindependence and sovereignty — that run counter to the\r\ncurrent general trends.\r\nTo play its role adequately, the United Nations must\r\nreform itself so as to increase the representativeness of its\r\ninstitutional organs and to democratize and ensure greater\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\ntransparency in our Organization’s working procedures and\r\nmethods. The cornerstones of the democratization of the\r\nUnited Nations system are the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and the enhancement of the role of the General\r\nAssembly. This is a complex and difficult task which\r\nrequires utmost perseverance. The expansion of the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council and the\r\ndemocratization of its decision-making procedures constitute\r\nan urgent demand of the international community. At the\r\nsame time, the authority and role of the General Assembly,\r\nthe broadest and most representative body, must be\r\nstrengthened in response to the legitimate appeal of us all.\r\nCertainly, the reform must be undertaken on the basis of\r\nthe agreed principles, particularly that of consensus,\r\nreflecting to the fullest extent the views and aspirations of\r\nthe majority of the member countries and ensuring the\r\ninterests of the different regions.\r\nIf in today’s world democracy in a society means the\r\nactive participation of its citizens, democracy in\r\ninternational relations requires the active participation of all\r\ncountries, large or small, rich or poor. Only an increasingly\r\ndemocratized United Nations can enjoy the prestige and\r\nconfidence necessary for playing its role in harmonizing the\r\nactions of States on the basis of international law, as all\r\ndesire it to. Let us build upon the momentum gathered at\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations so that on\r\nentering the twenty-first century, the United Nations can\r\ntruly serve as an example of democratization in the world’s\r\npolitical life.\r\nThe wise way to achieve the common objectives of\r\nnational independence, peace and development is that of\r\ncooperation in the spirit of equality, mutual respect and\r\nmutual benefit. The globalization of the world economy, the\r\nliberalization of trade and investment and the dizzying\r\nadvances of science and technology now present every State\r\nwith both unprecedented opportunities and imposing\r\nchallenges. It is no mere coincidence that the recent summit\r\nof the seven major industrialized countries, the G-7, in\r\nLyons, focused on the theme of globalization.\r\nHowever, the developing countries, and especially the\r\nunderdeveloped ones, are approaching this trial that is so\r\nvital for their development and prosperity poorly equipped\r\nand in extremely difficult conditions. Therefore, it is\r\nincumbent upon the international community and in\r\nparticular the developed countries, to give the required\r\nattention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial\r\nequation, because it is impossible to accept, in the context\r\nof interdependence, a world in which affluence is\r\nconcentrated in a small number of countries while the\r\nmajority of countries continue to struggle against\r\nincreasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the\r\npoor grows inexorably wider.\r\nGiven its strength and prestige, the United Nations\r\nis able to and needs to play a useful role in this process.\r\nIn implementing the Agenda for Development, our\r\nOrganization should concentrate first on the regions in\r\ndifficulty and on the essential issues. With its financial\r\nresources and groups of experts, the United Nations\r\nsystem can assist the countries of the South to overcome\r\ntheir disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts\r\nfor timely regional and global integration, in the context\r\nof an economic, trade, scientific and technological race on\r\na global scale.\r\nIn Viet Nam, for instance, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) is carrying out projects\r\nto assist us in our integration into the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). UNDP is also\r\nplaying an active and effective role to facilitate the\r\nestablishment of a framework for cooperation among the\r\ncountries along the Mekong. UNDP is currently working\r\non a national capacity-building project so that Viet Nam\r\ncan be prepared to participate more effectively in the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in the near future.\r\nSuch practical bilateral and multilateral development\r\nprojects are to be welcomed.\r\nHowever, we are now facing a glaring paradox: the\r\nneed for international cooperation for development\r\ncontinues to grow, while the available means become ever\r\nmore scarce and natural resources more depleted. In the\r\nfierce competition for development, States must\r\nconcentrate their resources on domestic needs in order to\r\nrestructure their economies and solve the pressing social\r\nproblems, thus enhancing their internal strength. That is\r\nquite understandable.\r\nNevertheless, in the current context of increasing\r\ninterdependence among States, international cooperation,\r\nespecially the flow of capital and technology transfer\r\nfrom the developed to the developing countries is\r\nindispensable, and it is also necessary and beneficial for\r\nthe sustainable development of the developed countries\r\nthemselves. Moreover, today, when urgent global issues\r\nare strengthening links between all States, a danger to one\r\nnation may also affect others, and the stability and\r\nprosperity enjoyed by one society may contribute to an\r\nenvironment favourable for the stability and prosperity of\r\nother societies.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nHunger, illness, social injustice and other phenomena\r\nare all potential threats to the security of each country and\r\nthe stability of the world as a whole. Allocating of\r\nresources to support the development of developing\r\ncountries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and\r\nmultilateral international cooperation for development are\r\nwise investments for peace and for the shared future of all\r\nof our societies.\r\nThe United Nations is not immune to this discrepancy\r\nbetween resources and the needs for development\r\nassistance. Today, the resources available to the United\r\nNations are not increasing; on the contrary, they are\r\nshrinking or being overextended. This worrisome situation\r\ncalls for the attention and responsibility of all Member\r\nStates, especially of the major Powers and developed\r\ncountries that possess greater resources and potential. The\r\nmeasure to be taken immediately, in the unanimous view of\r\nMember States, is for every State to fulfil its financial\r\nobligations. Moreover, all initiatives to provide\r\nsupplementary resources for the United Nations should be\r\nencouraged. Recently, scholars and renowned personalities\r\nhave advanced numerous interesting proposals in this\r\nregard. We are of the view that the General Assembly\r\nshould assign the Working Group on the Financial Situation\r\nof the United Nations and other relevant working groups\r\nthe task of seriously studying these proposals in order to\r\nexplore all possible ways of providing the United Nations\r\nwith the resources necessary to actively assist in\r\ndevelopment for all — first and foremost, that of the\r\nunderdeveloped countries.\r\nThe United Nations has a rather weighty responsibility\r\nregarding the demands of development. Its role in the\r\nglobalization process is therefore no less crucial. Since the\r\nbeginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated\r\nand organized a number of world summit conferences on a\r\nset of global issues ranging from environment to social\r\ndevelopment, from population to human rights, from\r\nwomen to children — and coming up we have the World\r\nFood Summit, the aim of which is to find and implement\r\ncoordinated measures at all levels — national, regional, and\r\ninternational — to solve problems of importance for the\r\nfuture of all nations.\r\nIf in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the\r\nparticipation of the majority of countries is somewhat\r\nlimited or even indirect, through an intermediary\r\nmechanism, in the resolution of the global issues for\r\ndevelopment the United Nations has been able to mobilize\r\nthe direct participation of all countries, big and small, rich\r\nand poor, developed and developing, because these are not\r\njust “to whom it may concern” issues. In this manner, the\r\nUnited Nations can succeed in its efforts to emerge from\r\na mere reactive role to crises and conflicts and play a\r\nproactive role in preventing such conflicts and crises.\r\nClearly, the resolution of global issues is always broadly\r\ndemocratic in nature.\r\nFor all these reasons, we hold that the United\r\nNations should further strengthen its role of assistance\r\nand coordination in this essential field and continue to\r\nadvance the implementation of programmes of action\r\nalready adopted. It is evident that no organization can\r\nreplace the United Nations in this vital role. In fulfilling\r\nthis role, the United Nations will see its prestige enhanced\r\nand its image brought closer to the life of each nation and\r\neach human being.\r\nThe year 1996 will go down in the history of Viet\r\nNam as the beginning of a new stage of development of\r\nour country. Last June, the Eighth Congress of the\r\nCommunist Party of Viet Nam was successfully\r\nconcluded. The special significance of this historic event\r\nis that, based on the successes achieved over the last 10\r\nyears of renewal, reform and national revival, the\r\nCongress decided to lead the country into a new phase of\r\nindustrialization and modernization, with a view to\r\ndoubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross\r\ndomestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam\r\ninto an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years.\r\nAt the same time, we have reaffirmed the pursuit of\r\nour foreign policy of independence and sovereignty,\r\nopenness, the diversification and multilateralism of our\r\ninternational relations, and regional and international\r\nintegration. It is because of this direction that the foreign\r\npolicy of Viet Nam has achieved and continues to achieve\r\noutstanding results, assisting in the work of nation-\r\nbuilding and development in a practical way, and\r\neffectively contributing to the resolution of international\r\nproblems.\r\nViet Nam has established diplomatic relations with\r\nover 160 countries, including all the major Powers and\r\nthe most prominent world political-economic centres. Viet\r\nNam has commercial relations with more than 100\r\ncountries and investment ties with over 50 countries and\r\nterritories. In addition to expanding its relations with\r\ncountries of all continents, last year as a full member of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations, one of the\r\nmost dynamic and successful of regional organizations,\r\nViet Nam actively contributed to regional and world\r\ncooperation and development.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nWe are participating more actively in the work of\r\ninternational organizations, especially those of the United\r\nNations system, as well regional organizations. This year,\r\nViet Nam begins its term as a member of the UNICEF\r\nExecutive Board, and will present its candidature for a seat\r\non the Economic and Social Council at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We hope to receive the support of\r\nMember countries of the United Nations to be able to\r\ncontribute our share to the work of that important body,\r\ndeveloping and coordinating policies of economic and\r\nsocial development and cooperation. We are currently\r\npreparing for the successful organization of the upcoming\r\nseventh Francophone summit to be held in November 1997\r\nat Hanoi. As regards broader integration, Viet Nam is also\r\nactively preparing to participate soon in other international\r\norganizations, such as the World Trade Organization and\r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.\r\nAs a new member of the Conference on Disarmament,\r\nViet Nam played an active part in the negotiations on the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which it recently\r\nsigned. By signing that Treaty, Vietnam joined in the broad\r\nappeal of the international community that all States refrain\r\nfrom all nuclear testing, regardless of the form, strictly\r\nobserve the ban on all nuclear-tests and undertake concrete\r\nsteps and measures towards the total elimination of all\r\nnuclear weapons. Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate with\r\nall countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty,\r\ncontributing to a cleaner environment, to greater confidence\r\nand to consolidation of international security, aimed at a\r\nmore secure and healthy world. At the same time, we hold\r\nthat the verification activities of the Treaty implementation\r\nprocess must be carried out in a fair and impartial manner,\r\nwith strict respect for the sovereignty of States. In this\r\nspirit, we view that the proposal for a programme of action\r\nfor the elimination of nuclear weapons submitted recently\r\nat the Conference on Disarmament by 28 States, including\r\nViet Nam, deserves serious consideration.\r\nTo achieve the objective and sincere desire to build a\r\nViet Nam with a prosperous people, a strong nation and a\r\njust and civilized society, we are determined to bring into\r\nfull play the achievements of the reform and renewal\r\nprocess and equip ourselves with the internal strength\r\nneeded to move forward steadily on the path of integration.\r\nOn the basis of our current international relations, we will\r\nstrengthen our cooperation with other countries and\r\ninternational and regional organizations; we will enhance\r\nproductivity; we will consolidate the peaceful environment\r\nand create international conditions still more favourable, in\r\nthe service of the prosperity of our nation as well as for the\r\nprosperity of the region and the world.\r\nAt the threshold of the third millennium, all nation-\r\nStates are subject to strong pressures of both opportunity\r\nand challenge. The vast ability of mankind in this age,\r\ntogether with the extraordinary advances in science and\r\ntechnology, offers us hope for development and prosperity\r\nfor all nations. Yet the poverty that afflicts more than one\r\nfifth of the world population and the gap between the rich\r\nand the poor raise concerns. The opportunities seem great\r\nbut the challenges are acutely felt. To begin the twenty-\r\nfirst century with more hope than anxiety, it will be\r\nimportant for us first to enhance our sense of\r\nresponsibility and broaden our overall long-term interests:\r\nthose of peace and development. There is no doubt that\r\nthe United Nations, the Organization to which we all\r\nbelong, will contribute actively towards achieving that\r\nend.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Belarus (His Excellency Mr. Uladzimir\r\nSyanko).\r\nMr. Syanko (Belarus): Allow me first of all to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the post of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession.\r\nGeneral debates over a number of years have already\r\nclearly indicated that virtually all Member States consider\r\nit of vital importance to transform the United Nations into\r\nan Organization with enhanced potential in the service of\r\npeace and security in the world.\r\nBelarus advocates a pragmatic approach to the\r\nreform of the United Nations based on a realistic\r\nassessment of the Organization’s ability to enhance the\r\npractical efficiency of the entire United Nations system\r\nalong the strategic lines of its activities. One of these is\r\npeacemaking, which in the aftermath of the cold war\r\nacquired new substance and quality.\r\nMr. Baumanis (Latvia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe New Testament reads,\r\n“Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be\r\ncalled children of God.” (Matthew, 5:9)\r\nToday’s efforts by the United Nations to maintain\r\npeace are noble indeed. Belarus supports actions to\r\nfurther perfect peacekeeping operations as an important\r\npractical instrument at the disposal of the United Nations.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nA crystal-clear understanding of peacekeeping operations as\r\na specific means used in conflict settlement, aimed at\r\nmaintaining peace rather than imposing it and at preventing\r\nhighly explosive situations from emerging, is a sure\r\nguarantee that such operations will be successfully\r\nimplemented.\r\nWe note with satisfaction a substantive breakthrough\r\nin the peaceful settlement of the conflict in the former\r\nYugoslavia. Belarus emphasizes the key significance of\r\nrestoring close economic, scientific and cultural ties\r\nbetween the States of the region for the normalization of\r\nthe situation in the Balkans. That is why we support the\r\nidea of making the decision of lifting the economic and\r\ntrade embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\na permanent one.\r\nBelarus attaches great significance to the process of a\r\npeaceful settlement in the Middle East, based on respect for\r\nthe right of all States of the region to live in peace within\r\ninternationally recognized borders.\r\nAs regards the ways and means to further perfect the\r\nSecurity Council’s activities, Belarus would like to\r\nemphasize the principle of balanced representation for all\r\nregional groups of Member States, in particular the Eastern\r\nEuropean group, in a renewed and expanded Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nGiven their particular significance, concerted\r\ninternational efforts in the field of disarmament are required\r\nin shaping the global security system that would befit the\r\ntwenty-first century. We consider it a great privilege and\r\nhonour that our practical actions and initiatives in this\r\ndomain have been recognized and supported through the\r\nelection of a representative of Belarus to the post of\r\nChairman of the First Committee at the current session.\r\nThis year has been marked by momentous events in\r\nBelarus. Very shortly the last nuclear missile will leave the\r\nterritory of our Republic, thus making the entire territory of\r\nCentral Europe, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone. This brings into particular prominence\r\nthe initiative put forward by Alyaksandr Lukashenka,\r\nPresident of Belarus, to establish a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone in Central and Eastern Europe.\r\nEfforts aimed at setting up and consolidating nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones in various regions of the world are\r\ngaining momentum. Hence, we consider it illogical for\r\nEurope to remain the only continent where no practical\r\nsteps have been taken in this direction. We strongly believe\r\nthat setting up a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central and\r\nEastern Europe would further enhance the spirit of trust,\r\nmutual respect and partnership in that part of the\r\nEuropean continent and would serve as a solid\r\ncontribution by the European nations to nuclear non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nIn the search for an efficient arms control regime,\r\nthe delegation of Belarus intends to initiate further\r\nconsideration at this session of the General Assembly of\r\nthe item on prohibition of the development and\r\nmanufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction\r\nand new systems of such weapons. Ecologically safe\r\ndestruction of weapons, conversion of military enterprises,\r\nlegal aspects of the transfer of sensitive advanced\r\ntechnology and of their impact on the development of\r\nscience and technology stand high on the list of our\r\npriorities.\r\nFrom this lofty rostrum I am proud to say that,\r\ndespite the formidable economic, social and financial\r\nconstraints we have had to overcome, Belarus has\r\ncompletely fulfilled all its obligations under the Treaty on\r\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe. Equally significant\r\nis the fact that Belarus submitted to the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations in July 1996 its ratification\r\ninstruments on joining the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention.\r\nLocated in the geographical centre of Europe, my\r\ncountry has set itself the goal of preventing dangerous\r\ntensions from evolving in the region which, more often\r\nthan any other part of the planet, has been a seat of world\r\nwars, in order to help prevent the emergence of new lines\r\nof separation, curtains, walls and other constructions that\r\nseemed gone for ever.\r\nFrom that perspective, we must bring to the\r\nAssembly’s attention the concern of the Belarusian people\r\nregarding the eventual rapid expansion of North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the deployment of its\r\nmilitary infrastructure in close proximity to our borders.\r\nIt is worth noting that a considerable part of the\r\npopulation of Belarus no longer considers NATO a hostile\r\norganization. Yet, being realistic, we must admit that\r\nmuch more time is needed to transform that attitude into\r\na sympathetic stance. It would be appropriate to expect\r\nthat such large and drastic transformations in the\r\nEuropean security system to evolve gradually.\r\nIn these new circumstances, the role of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\n(OSCE) acquires new significance. In all confidence, we\r\npin our hopes on the forthcoming OSCE summit in Lisbon.\r\nThe results of the summit, I am convinced, will prove to be\r\na solid basis for enhancing coordination between the United\r\nNations and the OSCE, as well as for better distributing\r\nbetween them the functions of ensuring regional security in\r\nEurope in order to help create a comprehensive security\r\nmodel for Europe in the twenty-first century and to further\r\nthe efforts towards concerted actions by European States\r\naimed at strengthening stability on the continent.\r\nGlobalization of the world economy made it possible\r\nfor the States to considerably expand their markets, as well\r\nas the flow of goods, services, finance and technologies, to\r\nadjust economic relations and to improve the economic and\r\nsocial well-being of their populations. At the same time, the\r\nremoval of trade and other economic barriers exposed the\r\nvulnerability of countries with less-developed economies.\r\nMany of those countries find it difficult to keep pace with\r\nthe rapid transformations now under way and to break the\r\nvicious circle of backward development.\r\nThat is why the countries with economies in transition,\r\nBelarus included, have every reason to expect that special\r\nmeasures will be taken by the United Nations in order to\r\nfacilitate their integration into the world economic and trade\r\nsystems and to help them join existing and emerging\r\nmultilateral economic institutions and mechanisms.\r\nWe reiterate our intention to host an international\r\nconference on the sustainable development of countries with\r\neconomies in transition, to be convened in Minsk in May\r\n1997. I am convinced that the results of the conference will\r\nprove a valuable contribution to the five-year review of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, at the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly next June.\r\nThe activities of the United Nations in the social and\r\nenvironmental fields have a particular significance for\r\nBelarus. The problems in these areas are extremely acute\r\ndue to the negative impact of a number of factors that\r\nemerged in the course of complex economic\r\ntransformations. The leadership of Belarus is undertaking\r\nconsiderable efforts to improve the quality of life of its\r\ncitizens. At the same time, we are not always able to\r\nresolve acute social problems by our own means alone.\r\nDecisions adopted at six world summits, held in Rio de\r\nJaneiro, Vienna, Copenhagen, Beijing, Cairo and Istanbul,\r\nhave prompted the needed and long-overdue adoption of a\r\nglobal programme of assistance to the countries that have\r\nembarked on the road of market reforms.\r\nThe problem of refugees, displaced persons and\r\nrepatriates is also very acute today. Our Republic\r\nwelcomes the results of the Geneva regional conference\r\non refugees, displaced persons, other forms of forced\r\nmovements and repatriates in the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS). I believe that the establishment,\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees, of a permanent regional centre on migratory\r\nproblems and refugees for the countries of Eastern Europe\r\ncould make a considerable contribution to the process of\r\ncomplete and effective implementation of those decisions.\r\nWe propose that such a centre be headquartered in Minsk.\r\nTaking urgent measures to combat terrorism, illicit\r\ndrug trafficking and organized crime is yet another\r\ndemand of the moment. Proceeding from this premise, we\r\nwelcome the initiative announced from this rostrum by\r\nPoland to introduce a draft United Nations framework\r\nconvention against organized crime.\r\nOur Republic does not possess nuclear energy, but\r\nmore than any other State in the world it is interested in\r\nthe implementation of effective preventive measures in\r\nthe field of nuclear safety that would make it impossible\r\nfor new Chernobyls to occur in the future. Belarus is in\r\nfavour of the comprehensive strengthening of the nuclear-\r\nsafety regime, including development and adoption of the\r\nappropriate international convention with concrete and\r\nstrong commitments under international control. The\r\ninitiative to establish a global fund for environmental\r\nprotection deserves most serious consideration. My\r\ncountry is grateful to the United Nations for its valuable\r\nefforts in coordinating, initiating and discussing\r\nChernobyl-related issues. This is extremely important to\r\nus. At the same time Belarus is deeply concerned over the\r\nfact that, alongside the ongoing discussion related to the\r\nclosure of the Chernobyl reactor, the problem of\r\nmitigating the medical and environmental after-effects of\r\nthe Chernobyl catastrophe — the main burden of which\r\nhas been borne by our young State — are being pushed\r\naside.\r\nWe are deeply concerned over the financial situation\r\nof the Organization. Admitting that Belarus now finds\r\nitself among the States with the biggest debts to the\r\nUnited Nations, we cannot but underscore that this\r\nsituation has emerged as a result of objective financial\r\nand economic difficulties experienced by Belarus at this\r\ncomplex stage of its development, as well as of the unjust\r\ndistribution of United Nations expenses among the\r\nMember States. Excessive rates of assessment for the\r\nUnited Nations regular budget and for peacekeeping\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\noperations has now resulted in one of the founding States\r\nof the United Nations being unable, for objective reasons,\r\nto fulfil its financial obligations to the Organization. In\r\nview of this, we support all-round measures aimed at\r\nreforming the entire financial system of the United Nations\r\nand the search for fair forms of financial cooperation\r\nbetween the Organization and the Member States, in\r\nparticular those whose arrears have accumulated due to a\r\nnumber of reasons beyond their control.\r\nFinally, the wide-scale reforming of the United\r\nNations system coincides with the democratic\r\ntransformations taking place in a number of States, Belarus\r\nbeing one of them. Given that the reforms now under way\r\nare of immediate concern to each and every citizen of our\r\ncountry, we are fully aware of their significance at this\r\ncrucial juncture in the development of international\r\nrelations. Comprehension of the importance of that factor\r\nenabled Belarus to secure public law and order, stability\r\nand peace in its territory. Yet sometimes it is not so easy\r\nfor the major political actors to achieve a coordinated\r\napproach to tackling the intricate problems facing Belarus\r\nat this transitional juncture in its history. Thus, it has\r\nbecome of vital importance today to find an efficient\r\nbalance between the legislative, the executive and the\r\njudicial branches of power and to ensure their stable\r\ninteraction. This is precisely the purpose of the upcoming\r\npopular referendum in Belarus, which is being held at the\r\ninitiative of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has also\r\nbreathed new life into its ideals and strengthened our belief\r\nthat the United Nations is a unique and genuinely integral\r\npart of international life. I am convinced that the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly can and must become a\r\nstarting point for effectively reforming the United Nations,\r\nwhich will be possible only through the joint efforts of all\r\nMember States of the Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Luis Valencia Rodríguez, Chairman of the delegation\r\nof Ecuador.\r\nMr. Valencia Rodríguez (Ecuador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I wish to extend to President Razali Ismail\r\nEcuador’s warm congratulations on his election, which is a\r\ntribute to his valuable contributions to the work of our\r\nworld Organization in his capacity as Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Malaysia. I wish also to convey our\r\nthanks to Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session, for the fruitful\r\nwork he accomplished.\r\nI wish to express to the delegation of Bulgaria the\r\nheartfelt condolences of the Government of Ecuador for\r\nthe irreparable loss it has suffered with the killing of\r\nformer Prime Minister Lukanov. Our condolences go also\r\nto the family and friends of that eminent man.\r\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, we\r\nremain immersed in a process of profound change on the\r\ninternational scene, resulting from the end of the\r\nideological confrontation between East and West. We are\r\nseeing the emergence of new opportunities for peace-\r\nbuilding, for the strengthening of development, for the\r\ndiffusion of democracy and for stepped-up international\r\ncooperation, especially politically. Ecuador believes that\r\nwe should take maximum advantage of these positive\r\nfactors and use them as a basis on which to devise the\r\nmost ambitious programme possible for the coming years,\r\nwith the goal of a world of equity and justice, a world in\r\nwhich future generations can live well, in secure\r\nconditions, at peace with themselves and with the\r\nenvironment on which their very survival depends.\r\nIn these circumstances, the essential objective of our\r\nOrganization, as established in the Charter, remains the\r\nsame: the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nTo attain this objective, it is imperative that all Member\r\nStates reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter. Most fundamentally, this means\r\nbanning the threat or use of force against the territorial\r\nintegrity or the political independence of any State, as\r\nwell as the obligation to settle international disputes\r\nexclusively by peaceful means. The larger goal of\r\ninternational security should be seen as embracing the\r\npolitical, economic and social conditions in which all\r\nnations develop.\r\nWhile the danger of worldwide nuclear destruction\r\nhas receded, Ecuador continues to maintain that\r\npreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is not an\r\nend in itself, but an intermediate step towards the ultimate\r\nobjective of totally banning and completely destroying all\r\nnuclear weapons. Ecuador regrets that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament was unable to adopt by consensus the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). It takes\r\nthe view, however, that the text supported by most States,\r\nwhich has been endorsed by the General Assembly and\r\nopened for signature by States, is an important step\r\ntowards that objective. Ecuador has signed that\r\ninstrument. Although it is not the ideal instrument for\r\nwhich the Conference on Disarmament was striving, it\r\nwould be a mistake to start this long and arduous process\r\nall over again. Ecuador will also continue to work for\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament, which will eliminate\r\nonce and for all the grave danger inherent in weapons of\r\nmass destruction and end the squandering of scarce national\r\nresources on weapons.\r\nEcuador voted in favour of resolution 49/75 K, by\r\nwhich the General Assembly requested the International\r\nCourt of Justice to issue an Advisory Opinion as to whether\r\ninternational law authorizes the threat or use of nuclear\r\nweapons in any circumstances. We welcome the Court’s\r\nunanimous finding that\r\n“There is in neither customary nor conventional\r\ninternational law any specific authorization of the\r\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons.”\r\nThe finding also states that\r\n“A threat or use of force by means of nuclear\r\nweapons that is contrary to Article 2, paragraph 4, of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and that fails to meet all\r\nthe requirements of Article 51, is unlawful.”\r\nIn its finding, the Court also expresses the view that\r\n“There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and\r\nbring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear\r\ndisarmament in all its aspects under strict and\r\neffective international control.”\r\nThe Government of Ecuador believes that the General\r\nAssembly should endorse these views, which form a basis\r\nfor the continued work of the international community to\r\nbring about the definitive banning of nuclear weapons.\r\nTerrorism in all its forms and manifestations;\r\norganized international crime; and the production,\r\nconsumption and trafficking of all illicit drugs continue to\r\npose grave threats that undermine international stability and\r\nthe security and well-being of society in general. To\r\neradicate these evils, we need a coordinated and persistent\r\ninternational effort in which all States should be involved,\r\nin accordance with their capacity and with their degree of\r\nresponsibility. In this regard, Ecuador is complying\r\nappropriately with its obligations.\r\nWe are currently experiencing the rapid globalization\r\nand interdependence of the world economy, which requires\r\nthe adoption of rational domestic policies and a favourable\r\ninternational economic environment. At present, the\r\npromotion of economic development is reflected in the\r\nliberalization of trade agreements and the establishment of\r\nan open multilateral commercial system. This new state\r\nof affairs has favourable effects; however, in certain\r\ncircumstances, it produces adverse consequences. For that\r\nreason it is imperative that policies and the international\r\nenvironment be structured so as to derive maximum\r\nbenefit from these trends and minimize the negative\r\neffects. Ecuador is mindful of this situation, but would\r\nalso like to stress the need, as expressed by the Heads of\r\nState and Government in the Declaration on the Occasion\r\nof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, to\r\n“Invigorate the dialogue and partnership between all\r\ncountries in order to secure the existence of a\r\nfavourable political and economic environment for\r\nthe promotion of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment based on the imperatives of mutual\r\nbenefit and interest and genuine interdependence,\r\nwhile recognizing that each country is ultimately\r\nresponsible for its own development”. (resolution\r\n50/6, para. 8)\r\nIn this regard, direct foreign investment in developing\r\ncountries is particular important because it accelerates the\r\neconomic process to the benefit of both the investors and\r\nof the recipient economies.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to be an\r\nimportant catalyst in support of the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the developing countries and of the\r\ndisadvantaged and marginalized sectors. The world\r\nOrganization has sponsored global conferences to address\r\nvital problems related to the environment, population,\r\nsocial development, crime, the advancement of women,\r\nthe protection of the family, human settlements, trade and\r\ndevelopment, and public administration. The\r\nrecommendations and initiatives adopted at those\r\nconferences have set genuine priorities for the\r\ninternational community in the promotion of development.\r\nNevertheless, what has been achieved to date in many of\r\nthese fields is still uneven and insufficient. Therefore,\r\nEcuador reaffirms that, in order to effectively implement\r\nthese decisions, there needs to be a rapid mobilization of\r\nthe resources for development, as well as a more efficient\r\nuse of those resources. Without such an international\r\ncommitment, all the conferences’ recommendations and\r\nother similar pronouncements will only enlarge the\r\noverloaded archives of our foreign ministries. Given the\r\npersistence of such environmental problems as the lack of\r\ndrinking water, threats to biological diversity, the\r\ndepletion of the ozone layer, the warming of the\r\natmosphere, the diminishing soil productivity,\r\ndesertification and diminishing food security,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nGovernments of both industrialized and developing\r\ncountries must take joint, concerted action.\r\nEcuador, faithful to its democratic traditions, has\r\nrecently provided an example of a transparent electoral\r\nprocess and of respect for the popular will. As a result,\r\nPresident Abdalá Bucaram was elected to lead the country,\r\nand for the first time in Ecuadorian history, a woman, Mrs.\r\nRosalía Arteaga, has been elected Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic. The new Administration’s first and principal\r\nactions are focused on social policies, especially on\r\ncombating poverty and on a wide-ranging national\r\nprogramme of low-cost housing.\r\nGiven its faith in the will of the people, Ecuador\r\nwelcomes the growing trend towards democratization: more\r\nand more countries have adopted multi-party systems,\r\norganized free and fair elections and begun to transform\r\nthemselves into more open and participative societies.\r\nHowever, Ecuador also believes that this process does not\r\nhappen spontaneously but requires the understanding and\r\nsupport of the international community so as to create and\r\nsustain conditions conducive to such changes. In other\r\nwords, democracy and hunger are antithetical elements that\r\ncannot exist together.\r\nThe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action —\r\nwhich is steadily gaining practical force and\r\neffectiveness — reaffirm the solemn commitment of all\r\nStates to promote and protect all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. The interrelationship between human\r\nrights, democracy and development articulated in that\r\nDeclaration and Programme, calls for a comprehensive and\r\nglobal approach to ensure the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nIn the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations, the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment reaffirmed that all human rights are universal,\r\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. They made a\r\ncommitment, among other things, to protect all human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms; to strengthen laws,\r\npolicies and programmes to secure the full and equal\r\nparticipation of women in all spheres of political, civil,\r\neconomic, social and cultural life; to promote and protect\r\nthe rights of the child; to ensure protection of the rights of\r\npeople who are particularly vulnerable, including young\r\npeople, the disabled, the elderly and migrant workers; and\r\nto promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations.\r\nEcuador considers that human rights has become one of the\r\nmost important spheres of United Nations action. It\r\nsupports the work of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights in his efforts to carry\r\nout this broad and important programme of activities.\r\nIt should be recalled that economic and social\r\nproblems are not restricted to the most disadvantaged\r\ncountries. A number of societies are seriously threatened\r\nby increasing external debt, the instability of the\r\ninternational financial system, persistent unemployment,\r\nintractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of\r\ncrime and corruption. The inequality gap between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries remains unacceptably\r\nlarge and continues to widen. More than 1 billion people\r\nlack drinking water, and 1.7 billion do not have access to\r\nproper health facilities. This means that poverty continues\r\nto affect more than one fifth of the world’s population.\r\nHunger, malnutrition, health problems, a total lack of\r\nhousing, limited access to education and other public\r\nservices and resources, social exclusion, alienation and\r\nviolence are only a few of the many factors associated\r\nwith poverty. The fight against this scourge is one of the\r\ngreatest challenges that the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies must face in close cooperation with\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole. Since 1990, commitments have\r\nbeen made and goals established, with a view to\r\nachieving the overall objective of eradicating poverty in\r\npartnership with all the actors associated with\r\ndevelopment. In this context, and from this lofty rostrum,\r\nEcuador would like to issue an urgent appeal to all\r\nMember States to intensify international cooperation, in\r\nits many aspects, in order to fight vigorously together to\r\nensure that these commitments and goals have practical\r\nand effective application. We must remember that poverty\r\nis not only a malady which destroys the societies directly\r\naffected, it is also a corrosive contagion that prevents\r\ninternational relations from developing on a basis of\r\njustice and equity.\r\nEcuador is a multi-ethnic country with sizeable and\r\nimportant indigenous groups and significant black\r\nminorities. For this reason, it considers that the\r\nInternational Decade of the World’s Indigenous People,\r\ndeclared by this General Assembly, establishes a\r\nprogramme of action that will restore the rights of those\r\npeoples, which have systematically been victims of a long\r\nhistorical process of exclusion and discrimination. We\r\nbelieve it is incumbent on the entire international\r\ncommunity to build universal understanding of the fact\r\nthat protecting those populations also means preserving\r\nthe cultural heritage of humankind. Ecuador trusts that it\r\ncan rely on international cooperation in order to\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nappropriately fulfil its obligation in this respect, in\r\ncoordination with its national programmes.\r\nThe founders of the United Nations must have realized\r\nthat they could not foresee exactly what the world would be\r\nlike 50 years hence. On the other hand, they established\r\nbasic objectives and principles and incorporated them in a\r\nCharter that is sufficiently flexible to enable the\r\nOrganization to serve its peaceful objectives and to evolve\r\nin response to new challenges. This is why the Charter, and\r\nits purposes and principles, has endured. However, today’s\r\nchanged circumstances, which determine the functioning of\r\nthe United Nations, demand a modification in the structure\r\nand the operational practices of our Organization. It is\r\nnecessary, among other things, to increase the United\r\nNations capacity to prevent conflicts through preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We need better\r\nways and means to respond to the challenges of emergency\r\nsituations. And, along with all of this, it is essential to fully\r\ncarry out the work of economic and social development.\r\nThe General Assembly must be revitalized as the pre-\r\neminent organ in which all Member States exercise on an\r\nequal footing their rights and duties as set forth in the\r\nCharter. Equitable representation in the Security Council\r\nmust be assured, and its size must be in proportion with the\r\nnumber of Member States. It must cease being an elitist\r\norgan with antidemocratic privileges, and the efficiency and\r\ntransparency of its work must be enhanced. The Economic\r\nand Social Council must regain its essential original\r\nfunctions as set out in the Charter: primarily, to promote\r\nwell-being and to improve living standards for all the\r\ninhabitants of the Earth. The current financial crisis is\r\nseriously affecting the United Nations ability to fulfil the\r\nlofty objectives set forth in the Charter. The greatest\r\ndebtors should set an example of their readiness to fulfil\r\ntheir obligations. Only if there is a general willingness to\r\nprovide the United Nations with the resources it needs, as\r\nwell as the necessary political support, will it be possible\r\nfor the global Organization to live up to the trust and hopes\r\nthat humankind has vested in it.\r\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that since the\r\nlast session, as regards the peacemaking process being\r\ncarried out pursuant to the Itamaraty Declaration between\r\nEcuador and Peru, and with the participation of the\r\nguarantor countries — Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the\r\nUnited States — several meetings have taken place at both\r\nthe diplomatic and military levels. At these there has been\r\nsignificant progress, progress that my delegation regards as\r\nconducive to finalizing the procedures for discussions on\r\nthe substance of the border dispute between the two\r\ncountries. The Government of Ecuador will continue to\r\nwork towards the achievement of the ultimate goal, which\r\nis no less than a fair, definitive and honourable solution\r\nto the problem.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on\r\nMr. Dioncounda Traore, Minister of State and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Mali and for Malians living abroad.\r\nMr. Traore (Mali) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me to begin by expressing, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Mali, heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to the President on his election to lead the\r\nfifty-first regular session of the General Assembly. His\r\nelection reflects the trust and esteem he enjoys in this\r\nOrganization because of his great diplomatic skills and his\r\nvast experience of international relations. While this is an\r\nhonour for him, it also honours his country, Malaysia, a\r\nfriend of my country’s and one that plays an important\r\nrole in international affairs, particularly within the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\nI am therefore convinced that the President will\r\nconduct the business of the fifty-first session in a\r\ncompetent and well-advised manner. He can certainly\r\ncount on the support of the Republic of Mali to contribute\r\nto the success of his mission. Allow me also to thank his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for the\r\noutstanding work he accomplished during his term of\r\noffice. Finally, I should like, on behalf of my delegation,\r\nto pay well-deserved homage to the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ncourageous action and tireless efforts for peace and\r\nunderstanding among peoples.\r\nThe end of the cold war gave the peoples of the\r\nworld cause to hope for the advent of a new era marked\r\nby the promotion of more stable and balanced\r\ninternational relations. To this end, the international\r\ncommunity must mobilize to find just and lasting\r\nsolutions to the many hotbeds of tension and conflict that\r\njeopardize international peace and security.\r\nIn this respect, Mali welcomes the qualitative\r\ndevelopment of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe welcome the holding of elections on 14 September,\r\nwhich marked a decisive stage for the future of the\r\ncountry. We exhort the international community to work\r\nto preserve and consolidate this newly restored peace.\r\nWe likewise welcome the possibilities that arose at\r\nthe latest Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) summit in Liberia for a settlement based on\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nnational reconciliation and the restoration of democratically\r\nelected institutions. Mali has worked steadfastly to find a\r\nsolution to the crisis in Liberia and is prepared to make\r\navailable a battalion to the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG).\r\nLikewise, Mali supports the efforts undertaken by the\r\ninternational community to assist the people of Burundi to\r\nestablish a lasting peace and national reconciliation. Mali\r\nalso supports United Nations efforts to establish a just and\r\nlasting peace in Angola.\r\nThe international community must do everything\r\npossible in Somalia to help bring about reconciliation and\r\nthe establishment of national institutions that are supported\r\nand trusted by all Somalis.\r\nRecent developments on the question of Western\r\nSahara require that our Organization work even more\r\nintensively towards the holding of a referendum, in keeping\r\nwith the relevant resolutions adopted on the matter.\r\nMali has always reaffirmed its support for\r\ninternational law and is concerned at the continued\r\nsanctions imposed on Libya, which have compounded the\r\nsufferings of the Libyan people, with whom my country\r\nreiterates it solidarity.\r\nLike other countries in the international community,\r\nMali is seriously concerned over recent developments in the\r\nsituation in the Middle East. My country remains convinced\r\nthat in order to settle the Israeli-Arab conflict, there is no\r\nalternative to the possibilities offered by the Madrid Peace\r\nConference. Mali therefore calls for the continuation of the\r\npeace process and for compliance with the commitments\r\npreviously undertaken.\r\nTo promote more stable and balanced international\r\nrelations, the present mechanisms for the consolidation of\r\npeace need to be strengthened; but we also need to find\r\nnew tools. The Agenda for Peace opens new possibilities in\r\nthis area.\r\nAccordingly, Mali welcomed the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a historic stage\r\nin the strengthening of general and complete disarmament.\r\nWe likewise welcomed the adoption on 11 April 1996 of\r\nthe Pelindaba Treaty, which made Africa a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone. My country also hopes that further progress\r\nmight be made to eliminate anti-personnel mines.\r\nMali has demonstrated its commitment to\r\nstrengthening the process of general and complete\r\ndisarmament through specific national and international\r\ninitiatives. Accordingly, in 1994, the President of the\r\nRepublic of Mali, His Excellency Mr. Alpha Oumar\r\nKonaré, requested and obtained special assistance from\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations to establish\r\na consultative mission responsible for studying ways and\r\nmeans to stem the proliferation of small arms in the\r\nSahelo-Saharan region. Indeed, our countries, which are\r\nnot arms producers, have become lucrative markets for\r\nthe war industry. Where did these weapons come from?\r\nWhat are their transit points? An answer to these\r\nquestions, in my delegation’s view, would make it\r\npossible to find ways and means to guarantee that the\r\npeople of the affected countries enjoy a safe environment\r\nconducive to pursuing development.\r\nBesides the support of other countries in the Sahelo-\r\nSaharan region, Mali’s initiative was also backed by other\r\nregions during the forty-ninth and fiftieth sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, namely through the adoption of\r\nresolutions 49/75 G and 50/70 H. Mali’s initiative helped\r\ngive rise to our Organization’s now-famous concept of\r\nmicro-disarmament, which seeks to draw the attention of\r\nthe international community to the disastrous\r\nconsequences of small weapons, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping countries, where they are used mostly to fuel\r\nconflicts.\r\nA better-structured and more united international\r\norder seems today to be the very precondition for\r\ninternational peace and security. Development is one of\r\nthe major challenges that our Organization must meet\r\ntoday. As Pope Paul VI has stressed,\r\n“Development is another word for peace.”\r\nThus, in order to establish the basis for a lasting peace,\r\nthe problems of poverty, destitution and social\r\nmarginalization must therefore be given priority at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI should like in this respect to stress the great\r\nimportance Mali attaches to the drafting of an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, the indispensable counterpart to the Agenda\r\nfor Peace. This entails the organization of international\r\ncooperation for development on a new basis, an area in\r\nwhich my country is working with resolve. The role of\r\nthe United Nations system in the development process\r\nalso must be strengthened.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nIn this connection, the Agenda for Development —\r\nwhich my delegation hopes will be adopted at this session\r\nof the General Assembly — will make it possible to\r\nrefocus the world’s attention on cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, particularly by encouraging new, more\r\ncomplete and more effective approaches to development. It\r\ncould also provide a way to strengthen coordination within\r\nthe United Nations system, particularly by recognizing the\r\nOrganization as a network of institutions responsible for the\r\neconomic and social development of the Member States.\r\nIn this respect, because of the persistent foreign-debt\r\ncrisis of the countries of the South and the dwindling of\r\nofficial development assistance, the question of\r\ndevelopment financing requires special attention.\r\nThe Agenda for Development should likewise take\r\ninto account the recommendations contained in the Plans of\r\nAction adopted by the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro; the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nheld in Cairo; the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nheld in Copenhagen; the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, held in Beijing; and the second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements, held in Istanbul.\r\nThe Agenda for Development clearly must give special\r\nattention to Africa. The socio-economic situation of our\r\ncontinent is indeed of great concern. Africa, which is\r\nconfronting all kinds of epidemic and endemic diseases —\r\nincluding malaria and AIDS — has only one doctor for\r\nevery 18,000 people, as compared to one doctor for fewer\r\nthan 400 people in developed countries. More than 80\r\nmillion school-age African children do not have access to\r\nprimary or secondary education. More than one third of\r\nAfrica’s population suffers from famine, and more than 23\r\nmillion children are malnourished. Finally, Africa is reeling\r\nfrom an external debt that in 1995 was estimated to be\r\n$322 billion, the debt servicing of which absorbs more than\r\none third of its export earnings.\r\nGiven this situation, in an increasingly interdependent\r\nworld, the international community must show solidarity\r\nwith Africa. That is why a solidarity pact between Africa\r\nand the rest of the international community was sealed with\r\nthe adoption of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. As we know, under\r\nthe terms of this New Agenda, Africa solemnly reaffirms\r\nthat Africans themselves are primarily responsible for the\r\neconomic and social development of the continent, while\r\nthe international community undertakes to support Africa’s\r\nefforts in attaining its development objectives.\r\nCommendable efforts have been made by African\r\ncountries in implementing this New Agenda. In the\r\npolitical and economic spheres, in particular, these have\r\nbeen achieved by consolidating the democratic process, by\r\npromoting investments and by taking account of\r\nenvironmental and population problems in development\r\npolicies. Mali has thus established a policy for economic\r\nrecovery and improved public financing. Macro-economic\r\ngoals, on the whole, have been attained.\r\nA broad range of structural measures has been\r\nimplemented through price liberalization; privatization;\r\nthe elimination or restructuring of many public\r\nenterprises; and the reform of the agricultural sector, with\r\na view to reducing costs and to increasing and\r\ndiversifying production. These tangible results enabled\r\nMali in February 1996 to conclude a new three-year\r\nagreement for the period 1996-1998 in the framework of\r\nthe Reinforced Structural Adjustment Facility.\r\nMindful of the need to accompany the promotion of\r\neconomic growth with resolute efforts in the social\r\ndomain to improve significantly the living standards of\r\npeoples and to reduce poverty permanently, my\r\nGovernment has expanded social services. In addition,\r\npriority in socio-economic development programmes has\r\nbeen given to women.\r\nSince 26 March 1991, Mali has continued its steady\r\nprogress towards consolidating its regained peace and\r\nbuilding a State based on the rule of law. The qualitative\r\ndevelopments that have taken place in Mali’s northern\r\nregions show clearly the determination of Mali’s young\r\ndemocracy to tackle and resolve all problems in a\r\nconcerted and peaceful way, with the active participation\r\nof all players and with scrupulous respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe organization of the “Flame of Peace” ceremony\r\nwas an eloquent illustration of this. It was a symbolic\r\nceremony to destroy the stockpiles of several thousand\r\nweapons that were surrendered by ex-combatants of the\r\nMouvement et Fronts Unis de l’Azawad and the\r\nMouvement Patriotique Malien Ganda Koy. It took place\r\non 27 March 1996 in Timbuktu under the presidency of\r\nthe Head of State of Mali, His Excellency Mr. Alpha\r\nOumar Konaré, and in the presence of the President of\r\nthe Republic of Ghana, the current President of ECOWAS\r\nand several ministerial delegations of Mali’s neighbouring\r\ncountries. The United Nations, which contributed to the\r\npeace efforts through the Department of Political Affairs\r\nand the United Nations Development Programme as well\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nas to the small-arms collection process, was also\r\nrepresented by an important delegation.\r\nDuring that ceremony the Mouvement et Fronts Unis\r\nde l’Azawad and the Mouvement Patriotique Malien Ganda\r\nKoy issued a joint declaration under which they\r\n“solemnly and irreversibly proclaim the dissolution of\r\ntheir respective movements and fronts”.\r\nThese positive developments in northern Mali mean\r\nthat real prospects now exist for integration and socio-\r\neconomic development in the region. We therefore appeal\r\nto the international community to support the efforts of the\r\nGovernment of Mali to consolidate democracy in the\r\ncountry; to continue to strengthen the peace that has been\r\nestablished with the participation of the country’s various\r\ncommunities; and to show its solidarity concretely, by\r\nproviding the necessary humanitarian assistance to meet the\r\nneeds of returning refugees and to help promote their\r\nreintegration.\r\nIt is thus important to undertake urgent work to\r\ndevelop the regions concerned by, inter alia, reintegrating\r\ndisplaced peoples, restoring our administration, boosting\r\nagricultural production and improving the functioning of\r\npublic services, in particular in the areas of education,\r\nhealth and justice.\r\nI take this opportunity to urgently appeal to Mali’s\r\ndevelopment partners quickly and effectively to implement\r\nthis programme, which, in the long run, aims at\r\ndevelopment within a State based on a strengthened rule of\r\nlaw and on democracy and human rights. Respect for the\r\nrule of law is of major importance to Mali’s Third\r\nRepublic, which makes the promotion and defence of\r\nhuman rights one of its priorities.\r\nIn this connection I should also note the\r\ninstitutionalization, which has now been going on for two\r\nyears, of the Space for Democratic Discourse, which\r\nenables individuals, civil society and political parties to\r\nmake direct and public appeals to the Government on 10\r\nDecember every year with regard to the respect of human\r\nrights in Mali. We likewise have institutionalized a\r\nchildren’s parliament, which provides a forum for the free\r\nexpression of Mali’s children to assist the public authorities\r\nin implementing the national plan of action for the survival,\r\ndevelopment and protection of children.\r\nMali — one of the six countries that initiated the\r\nWorld Summit for Children in 1990 — welcomed the\r\ncommemorative meeting held on 30 September 1996 to\r\nreview the progress made and to give thought to the\r\nadditional steps that need to be taken on behalf of\r\nchildren.\r\nThe consolidation of Mali’s young democracy\r\nrequires also the harmonious organization of relations\r\nbetween civilians and the military. With the support of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Government of Mali held a seminar\r\non this subject last July. A code of good conduct is being\r\ndrafted in this connection.\r\nI should like to underscore here, simply but\r\nforcefully, the importance Mali attaches to human rights,\r\nin particular the rights of women and children. We are\r\nconvinced that the role played by our Organization must\r\nbe backed up by concrete actions that stress the right to\r\neducation, health and life.\r\nThe international economic situation clearly shows\r\nthat the gap between developed and developing countries\r\nis widening. By generating an increase in inequalities and\r\nin the risk of social upheavals, this imbalance is making\r\nthe future of the world increasingly uncertain. Given the\r\nsituation, the international community must find adequate\r\nsolutions.\r\nIt is imperative that we find an answer to the\r\nexternal debt problem of the countries of the South. In\r\nspite of the progress made in this area, relief measures for\r\ndebt servicing remain insufficient. My delegation\r\ntherefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing\r\ndiscussions at the current meetings of the World Bank\r\nand the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a\r\nspecial fund aimed at considerably reducing the\r\nmultilateral debt of poor countries under structural\r\nadjustment result in a successful outcome.\r\nMy delegation deeply appreciates the important\r\nextension of $500 million, intended to reduce the debt of\r\nAfrican countries, made by the Group of Seven major\r\nindustrialized countries last June at their summit meeting\r\nin Lyons. This is an encouraging sign and an example to\r\nfollow.\r\nIt is just as important to support the efforts of the\r\nAfrican countries to diversify their economies and the\r\nrange of their commodities. It is also necessary to reverse\r\nthe current trend towards disinvestment and dwindling\r\nfinancial resources destined for Africa.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nWe should facilitate the access of African products to\r\nworld markets, particularly by lifting the tariff and non-\r\ntariff barriers that affect its finished, semi-finished and\r\nmanufactured goods. They should also receive preferential\r\ntreatment, as provided in the Final Act of the Uruguay\r\nRound concluded in Marrakesh.\r\nFinally, the international community should give its\r\nfull support to the Secretary-General’s United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa so that it does not\r\nsuffer the same fate as the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction for African Economic Recovery and Development.\r\nIn addition to the critical economic and social situation\r\nin Africa, there is the problem of the least developed\r\ncountries. For this reason, my country appeals to the\r\ninternational community to implement urgently the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s.\r\nMali also welcomes the proclamation of 1996 as the\r\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty. We hope\r\nthat the international community will achieve the goals of\r\nthe first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty.\r\nMy country hopes that the next World Food Summit,\r\nto be held in November in Rome, will make it possible for\r\nthe international community to reaffirm its commitment to\r\nensuring that poverty-eradication strategies are fully\r\nintegrated into all United Nations initiatives.\r\nMali has signed and ratified most international\r\narrangements regarding the environment and therefore\r\nwelcomes the convening of a special session devoted to a\r\nreview of the progress made by Agenda 21. Mali intends to\r\ncontinue to work towards the elaboration of the United\r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification in those\r\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, particularly in Africa. Mali is therefore\r\npleased at how fast the necessary ratification of 50 Member\r\nStates was achieved. My delegation is nevertheless\r\nconcerned about the deadlock on the question of a world\r\nmechanism. Mali believes that the mechanism should serve\r\nas a data bank and a supplier of the resources necessary to\r\nimplement national plans to combat desertification.\r\nOur Organization faces new challenges, both in the\r\nconsolidation of peace and in economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Its role is constantly growing, and increasing\r\nnumbers of voices throughout the world appeal to it. In\r\norder to meet the challenges of the day, our Organization\r\nmust have a sound and adequate financial basis. It must\r\nalso carry out the necessary reforms so that it can be\r\nmore effective and thus meet the aspirations of peoples\r\nfor security, justice and development. Accordingly, these\r\nreforms must apply to the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and the Secretariat, but particularly to the\r\nspecialized and development agencies responsible for\r\nelaborating and implementing development programmes.\r\nThis is an ambitious challenge, and Africa must\r\ncontribute significantly to efforts in that direction. The\r\ninternational community must renew its trust in Africa by\r\ngiving a second term of office to the Head of our\r\nOrganization, in keeping with past practice.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention of\r\nall members to document A/INF/51/3, which contains a\r\ntentative programme of work and schedule of plenary\r\nmeetings for the month of October and for the beginning\r\nof November.\r\nI should like to point out that this schedule was\r\nprepared to facilitate the organization of the work of\r\ndelegations and to help ensure that the relevant\r\ndocumentation is ready for the discussion of the\r\nrespective items. The lists of speakers for all the items\r\nlisted in document A/INF/51/3 are now open.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 18th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 2 October 1996\r\nI will, in due course, announce the dates for the\r\nconsideration of other agenda items as well as keep the\r\nAssembly informed of any additions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
