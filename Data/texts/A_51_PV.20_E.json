(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear a\r\nstatement by Her Excellency Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime\r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\r\nMrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPrime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, and to invite her to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMrs. Bhutto (Pakistan): On behalf of 130 million\r\nPakistanis, please accept, Sir, greetings on assuming the\r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly.\r\nI come to address the Assembly in the twilight of the\r\ntwentieth century, where we seem to be, in the words of\r\nCharles Dickens, at “the best of times” and at “the worst of\r\ntimes”. A century now comes to a close which witnessed\r\ntwo world wars, a Holocaust, hunger, hopelessness and the\r\nspectre of nuclear annihilation.\r\nBut there is another twentieth century that we should\r\nremember. The candle flickers on a century that brought\r\nmankind a technological and information revolution\r\nbeyond our wildest dreams; a century of breakthroughs in\r\nmedicine and health, in communication, in energy, in\r\ntransportation and in agriculture; a century that witnessed\r\nthe triumph of liberty over authoritarianism, the triumph\r\nof the free market over government control. One historian\r\nhas called the twentieth century the age of extremes.\r\nTested time and again, the world survived.\r\nI come before this Assembly, at this time of\r\ntransition from one century to the next — from the\r\nsecond millennium to the third — to speak of history, of\r\njustice and of morality. Today, the United Nations stands\r\nat the crossroads, not just of the calendar, but of the\r\ndirection of the community of nations.\r\nWe confront three simultaneous challenges. The first\r\none is the proliferation of conflicts, disputes and tensions\r\namong and within nations, and the accompanying rise of\r\nnational, ethnic and religious prejudice, intolerance and\r\narrogance. The second challenge is the persistent spread\r\nof poverty. The third challenge is the growing sense of\r\nalienation, the loss of people’s hope and confidence that\r\nthe world’s Governments will address successfully the\r\nmultifaceted problems inherent in the new technological\r\nera. The manner in which we address these problems will\r\ndetermine the quality of life that we bequeath our\r\nchildren.\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nWe remain deeply concerned at the conflicts and\r\ndisputes in many parts of the world — in Bosnia, in\r\nChechnya and in Azerbaijan. Our confidence in our ability\r\nto resolve conflicts has been visibly shaken after the\r\nexperiences of Somalia, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan,\r\nLiberia, Rwanda and Burundi.\r\nWe hope that the Middle East peace process,\r\nwelcomed by the world, will not be reversed and that all\r\nparties will honour their obligations under the agreements\r\nsigned.\r\nThe success of the Dayton Agreement and the\r\nrestoration of peace and justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nwill be an acid test of the world community’s will to\r\nprevent aggression and genocide in the future.\r\nYet there is another place on Earth where there is a\r\ntest of strength between the principles of law and freedom\r\nand the force of aggression and foreign occupation. After\r\nthe creation of the United Nations, the people of Jammu\r\nand Kashmir were among the first to have their right to\r\nself-determination recognized by the Security Council. I\r\nshould like to quote the words of the Security Council\r\nitself:\r\n“the final disposition of the State of Jammu and\r\nKashmir will be made in accordance with the will of\r\nthe people expressed through the democratic method\r\nof a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations.” (Security Council\r\nresolution 122 (1957), second preambular paragraph)\r\nAfter 50 years, the Kashmiri people still await the\r\nfulfilment of this resolution, of this commitment, of this\r\npromise.\r\nThe great African-American poet Langston Hughes\r\nasked fundamental questions about liberty. He asked:\r\n“What happens to a dream deferred?\r\nDoes it dry up\r\nlike a raisin in the sun?\r\nOr fester like a sore —\r\nAnd then run? (...)\r\nMaybe it just sags\r\nlike a heavy load.\r\nOr does it explode?”\r\nIn 1989, as the winds of freedom swept across the\r\nglobe, blowing away dictatorship, domination and\r\noccupation, a new generation of Kashmiris rose to demand\r\ntheir right to self-determination, a right that had passed\r\nfrom father to son, from mother to daughter — a torch\r\nrekindled from generation to generation. To suppress the\r\nbrave Kashmiri youth, India sent in 600,000 military and\r\nparamilitary forces. The tools of murder, torture, rape,\r\npersecution, arson, incarceration and assassination\r\nattempts were ruthlessly used. But as the Nobel Peace\r\nLaureate Martin Luther King said,\r\n“Freedom is never voluntarily given by the\r\noppressor. It must be demanded by the oppressed.”\r\nForty thousand Kashmiris have given their lives in\r\nopposing this oppression during the last seven years\r\nalone. India has recruited and trained renegades to subvert\r\nthe Kashmiri movement, to create dissension and to\r\ntarnish the image of the struggle for freedom. Under\r\nmounting international pressure, India sought this\r\nSeptember to divert world opinion by organizing a sham\r\nelection. Those very people who claim to be front-runners\r\nin the elections cannot even enter the valley without\r\narmed escorts, much less muster popular support.\r\nThis is what the world’s media had to say. The Arab\r\nNews of 8 September 1996 reported that its correspondent\r\nvisited Baramula that morning and saw the entire town\r\ndeserted. Not a single person was visible on the streets,\r\nwhich were being heavily patrolled. The New York Times\r\nof 7 September 1996 reported that while India hopes that\r\nthe elections will blunt the guerrillas’ appeal, there are\r\nmany in Srinagar who say New Delhi is chasing an\r\nillusion. The Economic Times, an Indian publication, of\r\n17 September 1996 reported that a number of booths in\r\nAnantnag and Pulwama recorded single-digit voting, even\r\nas late as 3 p.m. The Statesman, another Indian\r\npublication, reported on 22 September 1996 that Srinagar\r\nput up a stiff resistance to elections that day, and that\r\npolling was held in a curfew-like atmosphere on deserted\r\nstreets. According to the Voice of America’s broadcast of\r\n27 September 1996, United States Senator Tom Harkin\r\nsaid that these elections were fraudulent and would not be\r\nconsidered to reflect the legitimate aspirations of the\r\nKashmiri masses.\r\nThe Chairman of the Kashmir All Parties Hurriyat\r\nConference, Mir Umar Farooq, declared that such\r\nelections cannot be a substitute for the Kashmiris’ right to\r\nself-determination.\r\nThe United Nations Security Council declared in\r\nresolution 122 (1957) that the organization of such\r\nelections does not “constitute a disposition of the State”\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\n(resolution 122 (1957), operative para. 1) in terms of the\r\nplebiscite to be held under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. This was confirmed by a recent study by the\r\nInternational Commission of Jurists.\r\nI should like India to remember the words of the\r\nFrenchman André Breton, who said:\r\n“There is nothing with which it is so dangerous to\r\ntake liberties as liberty itself.”\r\nSo I stand before the United Nations General\r\nAssembly and urge “to thine own self be true”, to thine\r\nown Charter be true; and to thine own resolutions be true.\r\nIndia may argue that the Security Council resolutions\r\nthat guaranteed a plebiscite to Jammu and Kashmir are old,\r\nbut there is no statute of limitations on United Nations\r\nresolutions. Occupation, repression and annexation cannot\r\nnullify the actions of the Security Council itself. The\r\nresolutions of this body cannot be applied selectively only\r\nwhen politically expedient.\r\nPakistan calls on the United Nations to implement its\r\nown Security Council resolutions 47 (1948), 51 (1948), 80\r\n(1950), 96 (1951), 98 (1952) and 122 (1957) — seven\r\nspecific and binding resolutions guaranteeing self-\r\ndetermination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nKashmir is the core issue that divides India and\r\nPakistan. I had proposed a meaningful dialogue to the new\r\nIndian Prime Minister on his assumption of office, and was\r\nencouraged by his positive response. Unfortunately, the new\r\nGovernment persisted with the strategy of a sham election\r\nin occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nThe Kashmir dispute has led to four direct or indirect\r\nwars between India and Pakistan between 1947 and 1971.\r\nIndia has the third-largest army in the world today, almost\r\nall of which is deployed against my country Pakistan.\r\nSouth Asia lacks a regional security system. We in\r\nPakistan have made several proposals for conventional arms\r\ncontrol: first, the negotiation of a mutually agreed ratio of\r\nforces; secondly, measures to prevent the possibility of a\r\nsurprise attack; and thirdly, the adoption of agreed\r\nprinciples for conventional arms control in South Asia.\r\nOver the past 30 years, Pakistan has formulated a\r\nseries of proposals to contain proliferation of nuclear and\r\nmissile technology in South Asia. All along, India argued\r\nthat it opposed bilateral or regional measures and would\r\naccept only a global non-proliferation policy. The\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is exactly the\r\nkind of global measure for non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament that India had been championing for 40\r\nyears. Yet, unfortunately, India chose to veto the Treaty\r\nin the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, and it\r\nopposed the Treaty at the United Nations General\r\nAssembly just last month. So now the world can see the\r\nreality.\r\nLet me state that just as we are prepared to sign any\r\nand all nuclear treaties if India simultaneously signs with\r\nus, any step in nuclear escalation by our neighbour will\r\nfind a response from us to preserve our national security.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to propose to\r\nthis Assembly that it endorse the convening of a\r\nmultilateral dialogue for peace and security in South Asia,\r\nwith the participation not only of Pakistan and India, but\r\nof the five permanent members of the Security Council\r\nand other major Powers, such as Germany and Japan.\r\nThis multilateral conference could cover three critical\r\nareas: first, the resolution of the Kashmir dispute and\r\nother bilateral problems between India and Pakistan;\r\nsecondly, the promotion of conventional arms control and\r\nconfidence-building measures; and thirdly, measures to\r\npromote nuclear restraint and avert the danger of a\r\nnuclear-arms race in South Asia. I believe that such\r\nmultilateral talks offer a framework for genuine\r\nnegotiations that can lead to a resolution of disputes, avert\r\nthe nuclear threat and promote prosperity in South Asia.\r\nI hope this proposal will receive the support of this\r\nAssembly and of India.\r\nA clear distinction has been made by the United\r\nNations between terrorism and the legitimate struggle for\r\nnational liberation. We in Pakistan will always be at the\r\nforefront of the effort to combat terrorism because we\r\nhave frequently been victims of these crimes from across\r\nour own borders. This year alone we faced a series of\r\ncross-border terrorist attacks, but, by the grace of God,\r\nwe were successful in arresting different rings of cross-\r\nborder terrorists.\r\nHowever, I should like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress deep concern, on behalf of one billion peace-\r\nloving Muslims, at the propaganda from certain quarters.\r\nSome quarters are trying to present terrorism as peculiar\r\nto the followers of Islam; this is wrong. There is no place\r\nin Islam for acts of terrorism. However, let us\r\nacknowledge that in the post-cold-war period we are\r\nwitnessing the rise of extremist fringe groups in the East\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nand in the West. Whether it be Hindu fundamentalism,\r\nIslamic militancy, Judaic extremism, Le Pen’s racism in\r\nFrance, or the Oklahoma bombing in America, a number of\r\nyouth are turning to acts of violence. We who believe in\r\nthe policies of moderation, accommodation and tolerance\r\nmust unite against this new threat of violence and terror.\r\nInternational mechanisms and systems to check the agents\r\nof terror need strengthening, and we must condemn\r\nterrorists and extremists with one voice, irrespective of their\r\nrace, religion or creed.\r\nPakistan is the second-largest Muslim country in the\r\nworld. It is a democracy, and the Government I lead is\r\ndetermined to turn Pakistan into a fortress of enlightenment,\r\nemancipation and social advancement. This is no easy task\r\ngiven our recent history. The Afghan war led to the\r\nproliferation of arms and militancy in our region, and to the\r\nrise of ethnic, sectarian and separatist forces in the country.\r\nIt spawned a drug culture and failed to equip our youth for\r\nemployment in the modern world.\r\nToday we face, along with other countries of the\r\nworld, the dangers of debt, deficit and demography. I am\r\nproud to say that we in Pakistan have brought down our\r\npopulation growth rate from 3.1 per cent to 2.9 per cent.\r\nWe hope to reduce it further, to 2.6 per cent. In the last\r\nthree years, we have brought down our deficit by three\r\npoints, and a billion dollars of debt has been retired.\r\nHowever, the cost has been heavy.\r\nEach year we have had to present a harsh budget to\r\npull our country out of the quicksand of debt, deficit and\r\ndemography. This year alone, out of new budgetary\r\nmeasures of PRs. 40 billion, PRs. 22 billion went to debt\r\nservicing. The example of Pakistan shows why increasing\r\nnumbers of the world’s population live in poverty and\r\nsqualor, without access to clean drinking water, sanitation,\r\nschools or hospitals.\r\nThese bleak realities of debt servicing breed a despair\r\nand frustration that often manifest as random violence and\r\nterrorism. Despite this grinding poverty, the aspirations of\r\nthe marginalized keep rising due to the communications\r\nrevolution sweeping the world.\r\nThe world needs to devise a system under which\r\nGovernments adopting international standards of trade and\r\nhuman values get proportionate relief in their debt.\r\nShrinking aid flows have forced countries such as Pakistan\r\nto borrow capital at commercial interest rates. Indeed, debt\r\nservicing now accounts for 47 per cent of our budget. The\r\nnegative impact of such reverse transfers needs to be\r\nredressed.\r\nSimilarly, it is time to renew and implement the\r\npledge of the developed nations to devote at least 0.7 per\r\ncent of their gross national products for assistance to the\r\ndeveloping countries. Even this target has now dwindled\r\nto a level of 0.3 per cent of the gross national product of\r\nthe developed world.\r\nWe in Pakistan, committed to the dream of our\r\nfounding fathers, have chosen the path of a federal\r\nparliamentary democracy wedded to the concept of social\r\nequality. Under a democratic Government, Pakistan has\r\nplayed a responsible role in combating terrorism and\r\nnarcotics, promoting the rights of women and children,\r\nand working on non-proliferation issues such as the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We have done\r\nthis while confronting the forces of ethnicity,\r\nsectarianism, separatism and militancy that were tearing\r\nat our social fabric. Those who sought to undermine our\r\ncountry’s unity by undermining peace in our port city of\r\nKarachi have been defeated.\r\nWe have a clear agenda as we move towards the\r\ntwenty-first century: a Pakistan dedicated to the rule of\r\nlaw and to safeguarding the rights of its women, children\r\nand minorities; a Pakistan providing equal opportunity for\r\nthe advancement of its citizens by investing in health and\r\nin education; a Pakistan that has already attracted over\r\n$22 billion in investment pledges.\r\nI speak to you, Mr. President, in the twilight of a\r\ncentury that awaits the dawn of a fresh one. As I speak,\r\nI dream of a third millennium in which the gap between\r\nrich and poor evaporates; in which illiteracy, hunger,\r\nmalnutrition and disease are at long last conquered; in\r\nwhich every child is planned, wanted, nurtured and\r\nsupported; and in which the birth of a girl is welcomed\r\nwith the same joy as that of a boy. I dream of a\r\nmillennium of tolerance and pluralism, in which people\r\nrespect other people, nations respect other nations, and\r\nreligions respect other religions.\r\nThat is the third millennium I see for my country\r\nand others — for all children. Let the United Nations be\r\nthe infrastructure for making this dream into a reality.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Pakistan for the statement she has just made.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nMrs. Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, Constitutional President\r\nof the Dominican Republic, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nConstitutional President of the Dominican Republic, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Fernández Reyna (Dominican Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): The Dominican Republic was\r\namong the countries that founded the United Nations. But\r\nthis is only the third time, in 51 years, that its Head of\r\nState has come to address the General Assembly. Perhaps\r\nthe reason for this noticeable absence of our country during\r\nthe many years that this great annual event has been held\r\nis that following the Second World War, the international\r\nsystem revolved around super-Power rivalry, giving rise to\r\nthe cold war. In context, it is probable that our leaders felt\r\nthat their presence here would have been merely symbolic,\r\nwith no real importance.\r\nThat this may have been the case in the past, but the\r\nworld has changed. From the dramatic transformations in\r\nthe geopolitical environment, a multi-polar international\r\nsystem has emerged, in which the economy matters more\r\nthan ideologies and military conflicts. This reorganization\r\nof the international system on the basis of strategic\r\neconomic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific\r\nand technological revolution, a revolution of knowledge that\r\nspread across the planet and brought about the most\r\nprofound change ever experienced in the history of\r\nhumankind, turning the world into one large neighbourhood.\r\nIn the new international order that arose following the\r\ncold war, the Dominican Republic could not remain\r\nisolated. That is why we are here today: to proclaim to the\r\nworld that the Dominican Republic is now actively joining\r\nthe group of nations represented in this multilateral\r\nOrganization, so that, through international contacts and\r\nexchange, it can contribute to forging a better future for\r\nhumanity and, accordingly, a more promising future for\r\nDominicans.\r\nTo ensure our participation in the various forums of\r\nthe United Nations forums, exercising all the rights that\r\nhave been bestowed upon us, we proceeded, first, to pay\r\nour financial debts in full. To the Dominican Republic,\r\nthe payment of our arrears is evidence of our confidence\r\nand faith in the capability of the United Nations to play\r\na role in the international arena to guarantee international\r\npeace and security as well as respect for human dignity\r\nand fundamental human rights.\r\nNevertheless, just as we understand that the world\r\nhas changed, that there is a new international agenda\r\ngoverned by the common concerns of all peoples over\r\nenvironment preservation, population growth, respect for\r\nhuman rights, strengthening of democratic systems,\r\nrecognition of women’s rights, and the social and\r\neconomic development of nations, we also understand that\r\nthis Organization must be renewed and readapted to the\r\nnew world circumstances.\r\nLatin America and Africa do not have permanent\r\nrepresentatives on the Security Council, and Asia has only\r\none. This means that there is uneven representation in that\r\nimportant body, which is incomprehensible in an\r\nOrganization whose Members enjoy equal footing, on the\r\nprinciple that they are all sovereign States. It is our\r\nhumble suggestion that the Security Council should be\r\nextended to enable Asia, Africa and Latin America to\r\nhave two permanent seats on that body and that the\r\nnumber of non-permanent representatives be increased to\r\ndemocratize the decision-making machinery in that forum\r\nfor peace.\r\nIn one of his most frequently-cited works on the\r\nCaribbean, entitled El Caribe, Frontera Imperial, the\r\nformer Dominican President and author, Juan Bosch,\r\nwrote as follows:\r\n“The history of the Caribbean is the history of\r\nthe struggle of empires against the peoples of the\r\nregion in order to rob them of their rich lands. It is\r\nalso the history of the struggle of empires against\r\none another to rob the possessions each one had\r\nconquered. Lastly, it is the history of the peoples of\r\nthe Caribbean to free themselves from their imperial\r\nmasters.”\r\nThis direct contact with the major Powers over the\r\ncourse of five centuries, a product of these confrontations,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nhas marked the Caribbean, perhaps forever, with a\r\nparticular stamp of fragmented histories, and different\r\ncultures and languages. Yet we are always seeking unity\r\nwithin diversity.\r\nRecent years have brought greater understanding and\r\ncloser bonds between us, based on the understanding that\r\nwe have a common destiny. As proof of this, our country\r\nis a founding member of the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates (ACS), an organization bringing together nations that\r\nare very different both in ethnic terms and in development\r\nlevels, and thus reflecting the richness and variety of our\r\nregion.\r\nWe would be pleased to see formal contact with and\r\nbacking from the United Nations for that recently created\r\nbody, in support of the efforts we have made to strengthen\r\nour relations and to work for our peoples’ development.\r\nSimilarly, we have been participating in the Caribbean\r\nForum of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States,\r\nwhich is made up of Caribbean countries that benefit from\r\nthe Fourth Lomé Convention. This forum has carried out a\r\nseries of regional projects financed with European Union\r\nresources.\r\nAs an observer, and aspiring full-fledged member, of\r\nthe Caribbean Community and Common Market\r\n(CARICOM), we view with great interest the widening and\r\ndeepening relationship between the United Nations and\r\nCARICOM. We urge that the necessary steps are be taken\r\nto intensify the cooperation and coordination between the\r\ntwo institutions, which would enable us to achieve our\r\ncommon goals.\r\nThe countries of the Caribbean are facing the\r\nchallenges of current circumstances, as the advantages of\r\naccess to markets are being eroded because of the\r\nimplementation of World Trade Organization agreements,\r\nthe effects of a single European market, the consolidation\r\nof the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\r\nand the movement towards reciprocity and similar trends.\r\nOur participation in preferential access schemes\r\ndepends on the observance of established standards with\r\nregard to workers’ rights, human rights, intellectual\r\nproperty rights, the environment and civil liberty — matters\r\nthat go beyond economic considerations.\r\nWe have gained certain advantages from preferential\r\ntrading with the United States and the European Union, as\r\na result of greater prosperity that led to an increase in\r\nimport demand from those countries and an increase in\r\ntourism in the Caribbean. By contrast, we must endure the\r\ncomplications of the new rules and harmonization\r\nstandards that have come into force. We have not yet\r\ntaken full advantage of the benefits deriving from such\r\nconcessional agreements as the Fourth Lomé Convention,\r\nthe Generalized System of Preferences, and the Caribbean\r\nBasin initiative.\r\nOur high dependence on foreign trade, the shortage\r\nin the supply of goods and services and unsuitable\r\nmarketing methods constitute elements of vulnerability\r\nthat affect, to a greater or lesser extent, all the countries\r\nof the region. We must overcome these limitations and\r\ndefine areas in which we can be competitive.\r\nStrengthening cooperation is one way to support the\r\nCaribbean integration process and rectify such\r\nweaknesses.\r\nWhen referring to the Caribbean, let us not forget\r\nthe situation in Haiti, the country with which we share the\r\nisland of Hispaniola. We view with sympathy the process\r\nof democratization that is unfolding in that country, and\r\nwe appeal to the international community to do its utmost\r\nto assist in the huge task faced by the children of the\r\ncountry of Toussaint L’Ouverture in constructing a better\r\nfuture for their countrymen.\r\nOne of the first foreign-policy actions of our\r\nGovernment was to encourage a cooperative and friendly\r\nrelationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti,\r\nand we put in place the Joint Bilateral Commission. After\r\na fruitful meeting, which took place a few day ago in\r\nPort-au-Prince, that Commission agreed to a series of\r\ntechnical exchange agreements in the fields of tourism,\r\nagriculture, trade and investment, sports and border and\r\nimmigration matters. Furthermore, we defined the\r\nconditions for joint strategies to take advantage of funds\r\nprovided by multinational sources, such as those granted\r\nby the European Union under the terms of the Fourth\r\nLomé Convention.\r\nI would now like to direct the attention of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to a subject that just a few years ago\r\nwas on the front pages of all the newspapers of the world\r\nand that, even though it still has a considerable impact on\r\nthe effectiveness of development policies, has vanished\r\nfrom the world’s attention: the problem of foreign debt.\r\nThe countries of the region have carried out a series of\r\nadjustment programmes in an attempt to regain external\r\nfinancial solvency. Nonetheless, there are still\r\nconsiderable imbalances as a result of the burden of debt\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nservicing, without a corresponding recovery in the terms of\r\nexchange that would allow us to create greater resources\r\nthrough our exports.\r\nIn the case of the Dominican Republic, foreign debt\r\nincreased 13-fold between 1964 and 1994. Today, thanks to\r\nour extraordinary efforts, our country is now current with\r\nits international creditors, which means that we are eligible\r\nfor further external financing. However, being current with\r\nour payments to international credit organizations has meant\r\nthat our Government has incurred greater social debts to the\r\nDominican people. There are fewer resources to invest in\r\neducation, health, housing and social security and,\r\nultimately, to deal with the critical situation of poverty that\r\naffects most of our people.\r\nIn its 51 years of existence, the United Nations has\r\nmade extraordinary efforts to eradicate bellicose conflicts in\r\ndifferent parts of the world and to contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and international security. But great\r\nhuman sacrifice is inherent in the theatre of war, and our\r\nimpoverished neighbourhoods have adopted the names of\r\nwar-torn places, symbolizing the extent of their fight\r\nagainst misery. In the Dominican Republic the poor and\r\nmarginalized neighbourhoods have adopted such names as\r\nViet Nam, Katanga and Cambodia; none of them, of course,\r\nis called Sweden, Japan or Germany. This means that this\r\ninternational Organization’s new role is to guarantee\r\ninternational peace and security through mechanisms to\r\npromote the economic and social development of the less\r\nfortunate nations.\r\nFor this reason, with respect to debt, our country\r\nbelieves that multilateral organizations that provide\r\ndevelopment assistance and the donor Governments,\r\ntogether with the debtors, must find more lasting solutions\r\nto the burden of foreign debt servicing, so that we can\r\nrelease resources that can immediately be used to fight\r\npoverty and to stop the deterioration of the environment.\r\nWe have made progress in that regard, and it is fair to\r\nrecognize that the G-7, the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nWorld Bank and the regional banks for development\r\nassistance, such as the Inter-American Development Bank,\r\nhave consistently designed and implemented important\r\nmechanisms to alleviate the foreign-debt burden, among\r\nwhich the so-called Brady plan and the G-7 programmes\r\nfor the reduction of bilateral debt stand out.\r\nHowever, in the near future we will need to review\r\nsome of the sacred principles prevalent in the international\r\nfinancial community now for many years, such as those\r\nrelated to the Paris Club cut-off date and the impossibility\r\nof debt restructuring with multilateral organizations. This\r\naffects especially the so-called least developed countries,\r\nwhich could receive preferential treatment in this regard.\r\nThe Dominican Republic therefore urges all interested\r\nparties to move forward to enable the underdeveloped\r\ncountries to implement viable programmes against poverty\r\nand marginalization, within a financially sustainable\r\ncontext.\r\nIn addition to the fight against poverty, at this stage\r\nof reforming the international system it is important to\r\ntake all appropriate measures to fight terrorism and illegal\r\ndrug trafficking, scourges that deeply affect the normal\r\ndevelopment of mankind. Recently, international drug\r\ncartels have tried to use Caribbean routes to carry out\r\ntheir illegal operations. The Dominican Republic has been\r\ntaking all possible measures to prevent the use of its\r\nterritory as a medium for drug trafficking and drug use.\r\nFor Dominicans, drug use and trafficking are a national\r\nsecurity problem, which we will fight with the necessary\r\nforce to eliminate an evil that has become the great\r\nplague of mankind at the end of the twentieth century.\r\nIn expressing its willingness to play a more active\r\nrole in the international system, the Dominican Republic\r\nalso expresses its concern at the many unresolved\r\nconflicts in different parts of the world. We advocate a\r\ndefinitive and peaceful resolution of the conflict in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina; of the search for peace in Middle East\r\nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization; of cooperation and assistance\r\nwith regard to situations such as those of Somalia,\r\nBurundi and Liberia. As to the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan, we believe that due to its location in the centre\r\nof East Asia, its security and stability bear a close relation\r\nwith the peace and prosperity of that region, and we\r\ntherefore encourage both the sides along the Taiwan Strait\r\nto resume constructive dialogue with a view to achieving\r\nmutual cooperation and understanding. We believe that\r\nthe parallel participation of both sides in the United\r\nNations would be conducive to maintaining peace.\r\nWe stand at the threshold of a new century and a\r\nnew millennium, which will bring new challenges as well\r\nas new opportunities for human progress, and an\r\nOrganization such as the United Nations has always\r\nserved to stimulate the noblest of human aspirations. The\r\nDominican Republic, trusting in God and in the creative\r\ncapacity of its people, aspires to be a spokesman and an\r\ninstrument for channelling the ideals of justice, peace,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\ndemocracy and prosperity, which inspire the civilized\r\nnations of the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Constitutional President of the\r\nDominican Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, Constitutional President\r\nof the Dominican Republic, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of State,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and for Senegalese\r\nliving abroad, His Excellency Mr. Moustapha Niasse.\r\nMr. Niasse (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nYour noteworthy election, Sir, to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session is an eloquent\r\nand solemn tribute from the Members of our Organization\r\nto your great country, Malaysia. Your intellectual and moral\r\nqualities, your faith in the United Nations and your vast\r\nexperience in international relations guarantee, in our view,\r\nsuccess in the work of this session. For all these reasons,\r\nSenegal, which enjoys a strong relationship of friendship\r\nand cooperation with your country, is happy to convey to\r\nyou, through me, warm congratulations. We assure you of\r\nour full support in the achievement of the lofty mission\r\nentrusted to you.\r\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral, I wish to express our profound gratitude\r\nfor the effectiveness, competence and the commitment with\r\nwhich he discharged his mandate during a historic and\r\nparticularly productive session.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at this\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali is an ardent champion of peace and\r\ncooperation among peoples, and his commendable work for\r\nthe United Nations should be emphasized today, to\r\nencourage perseverance along this path. Moreover, the\r\nAfrican Heads of State recently adopted at Yaoundé a\r\nstatement recommending his re-election to a second term of\r\noffice as United Nations Secretary-General.\r\nMr. Fernández Estigarribia (Paraguay), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe international climate today strikes us as one of\r\nthose special situations that should awaken our\r\nconsciences, inviting us to enhance our efforts and clarity\r\nof vision to ensure humanity a future of peace, solidarity\r\nand cooperation.\r\nIndeed, we are meeting at a time conducive to major\r\nchanges in the life of our Organization. The most striking\r\nillustration of our common desire for reform was\r\nexpressed here last year, during the solemn\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. It was in that spirit that during the\r\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly some\r\nof the most authoritative voices in the world — those of\r\n128 Heads of State and Government — forcefully\r\nreaffirmed their profound faith in the United Nations, its\r\nprinciples and objectives.\r\nFurthermore, these leaders unanimously called for\r\nin-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first\r\ncentury with a restructured, reinvigorated Organization,\r\nequipped with the necessary human, material and financial\r\nresources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission\r\nof an Organization that harmonizes the complementary\r\nefforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in\r\na context of freedom and active solidarity.\r\nGuaranteeing peace and collective security;\r\ndeveloping friendly relations among nations based on\r\nshared values; promoting respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms; and developing varied forms of\r\ncooperation in the economic, social, cultural and\r\nhumanitarian fields — these were the dreams of those\r\nwho, 50 years ago, created the United Nations. They are\r\nstill today the foundation, the moral basis and the\r\njustification for the objectives we must continue to pursue\r\nin these final years of the twentieth century, a century\r\nthat, despite two world wars, was one of prodigious\r\ndiscoveries — a century that saw man walk on the moon,\r\nexplore the environs of Mars and make significant\r\nprogress in combating disease.\r\nHowever, we must agree that today’s world is not\r\nthe world of 50 years ago. This one presents new and\r\nwidespread dangers but also offers different possibilities.\r\nWe must therefore close ranks, minimize our differences\r\nand combine our efforts, as peoples, nations, States and\r\ncommunities.\r\nToday, all nations face an enormous paradox: on the\r\none hand, countries have never been closer to one another\r\ndue to the increasing globalization of technology; on the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nother hand, the fragmentation of nationalities has triggered\r\nthe resurgence of new forms of confrontation and conflict,\r\nas well as misunderstandings and serious delays in the\r\nevolution of continents.\r\nDuring the cold-war period, it was generally\r\nconsidered that the main threats to peace would come from\r\nwars between States, and the greatest fear was that a\r\nnuclear conflict would break out and devastate the planet.\r\nThe end of the cold war gave rise to a sense of trust\r\nin the advent of a world free from the spectre of a nuclear\r\ncataclysm, which we welcomed with optimism. We shared\r\nthe belief that the many regional conflicts could be resolved\r\nquickly once they were no longer fuelled by unbridled\r\nmilitary assistance and by positions of continual escalation\r\nin both hemispheres.\r\nToday, unfortunately, we are forced to recognize that\r\nthe state of the world for the most part belies these\r\noptimistic visions; many old conflicts continue to resist the\r\ninternational community’s attempts to settle them.\r\nPernicious and persistent intra-State conflicts have broken\r\nout. The conflicts in Africa and in the former Yugoslavia\r\nillustrate this situation.\r\nIndeed, from Angola to Somalia, from Burundi and\r\nRwanda to Liberia, Africa is beset by conflicts whose\r\nnature, as we are forced to recognize, prevents the proper\r\nand effective implementation of the solutions proposed.\r\nIt is true that significant progress has been made in\r\nsome of these conflicts, particularly in Angola and to a\r\nlesser extent in Rwanda. We need to continue our efforts in\r\nthis direction.\r\nIn other conflicts, the road to peace remains uncertain.\r\nIn Liberia, the situation is extremely murky due to the\r\ndifficulty of managing conflicts between rival factions,\r\ndespite the initiatives of the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the African\r\ncountries in the area.\r\nHowever, we must not become discouraged. At the\r\nrecent Ministerial meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, the member\r\ncountries of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) took some courageous decisions. These,\r\nwe hope, will create new conditions conducive to the\r\nnormalization of the situation in that country through the\r\norganization of free and democratic elections, with the full\r\nsupport of the entire international community.\r\nTurning to Burundi, it is clear that the measures\r\nprescribed by the United Nations and by the OAU have\r\nnot managed to end the bloodshed, nor did they prevent\r\nthe military coup de force of 25 July last. This is\r\nregrettable and we must take action.\r\nHowever, we must not lose faith. Given this new\r\nsituation, Senegal, like the African countries of the Great\r\nLakes region, calls for the restoration of constitutional\r\norder and reaffirms its conviction that any solution to the\r\ncrisis in Burundi requires the initiation — despite any\r\nfeelings of resentment — of a free and transparent\r\ndialogue in good faith between the various parties to the\r\nconflict.\r\nIn Europe, the former Socialist Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia represented, before it was torn apart, a\r\nsuccessful example of a pluralistic and harmonious ethnic\r\nand religious coexistence, which was the pride of the\r\nworld. It was in the name of these values that, from the\r\nbeginning of the conflict, Senegal rejected any notion of\r\npartitioning Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that is why it\r\nwelcomed with great hope the signing of the Dayton\r\nAgreement. It is in this spirit that the momentum for\r\npeace of this Agreement must be consolidated.\r\nIn this regard, the smooth conduct of the elections of\r\n14 September was an important step. The prosecution,\r\narrest and sentencing of war criminals by the international\r\ncriminal Tribunal remains a major test for the\r\ninternational community. More than that, is it a matter of\r\nproving that our community is able to implement Security\r\nCouncil decisions.\r\nAgainst this background, Senegal, my country, will\r\ncontinue, as it has in the past, to do what it can within the\r\nframework of the Contact Group of the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference (OIC) to bring about the advent of\r\na Bosnia and Herzegovina at peace with itself, so that the\r\nseeds of peace and stability can finally bear fruit in this\r\nwar-torn land and throughout the rest of the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nExactly one year ago we welcomed with relief the\r\nsigning of the Washington and Taba agreements —\r\nimportant milestones for the establishment of peace and\r\nreconciliation between the peoples of the Middle East.\r\nThe door thus opened must never close again. Today,\r\nregrettably, doubts and the fear of returning to a past\r\nmarked by war and hatred are beginning to resurface. Let\r\nus put an end to these threats while there is still time.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nWhile my country has always believed, and continues\r\nto believe, that some realities are inescapable — the\r\nexistence of Israel is one of them — it is also of the\r\nopinion that the security of that State can, in the long term,\r\nbe assured only in the framework of respect for, and\r\nimplementation of, the current peace process, which should\r\nlead to the definitive creation of a sovereign and\r\nindependent Palestinian state, a fully-fledged member of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is therefore up to the new Israeli Government,\r\nelected in May 1996, to make decisive efforts so that the\r\nflame of peace, ignited just recently with such courage and\r\nclear-sightedness, continues to inspire the leaders and\r\npeoples of Israel and Palestine towards a Middle East that\r\nbuilds its future on a spirit of solidarity, cooperation and\r\nfriendship.\r\nGiven the changes in the world since the fall of the\r\nBerlin Wall and given the new types of conflicts, which\r\nrequire a new approach to the management of our collective\r\nsecurity system, our Organization, the United Nations, must\r\nbe understood, supported and strengthened.\r\nIncreasingly, the United Nations has been called on to\r\ncreate a new generation of peacekeeping operations. The\r\nBlue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who\r\nprovide political, economic, social and humanitarian\r\nassistance, thus contributing to the stabilization of situations\r\nand conflicts as well as to the search for a political\r\nsettlement to conflicts through national reconciliation\r\nwhenever necessary.\r\nAccordingly, my country, Senegal, will continue to\r\ntake part with resolve in this noble mission in the service\r\nof peace, with the conviction that has always inspired our\r\ninternational policy. This same desire prompted its\r\nparticipation, with 36 other countries, in the standby forces\r\nsystem initiated recently by the Secretary-General, as well\r\nas its commitment to the establishment of an early warning\r\nand rapid reaction system.\r\nGuided by these same principles, Senegal continues to\r\nmake a modest contribution to the attainment of the goal of\r\ncomprehensive and effective disarmament. Senegal’s recent\r\nadmission to the Conference on Disarmament, when that\r\nbody was expanded, attests to its will to work together with\r\nall peace-loving nations to build a better future in a world\r\nfree from weapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn this respect, I wish to welcome warmly the\r\nagreement concluded here on the indefinite extension of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\r\nparticularly since it meets the concerns of all Member\r\nStates of our Organization, specifically the African States.\r\nIn a spirit of remarkable unanimity, African States signed\r\nin Cairo last March the Pelindaba agreement on the\r\ndenuclearization of the continent.\r\nIn the same spirit, the international community\r\nrecently took an important step to halt the nuclear arms\r\nrace with the adoption by the General Assembly on 10\r\nSeptember 1996 of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty, which my country has just signed on 26\r\nSeptember 1996, here in New York.\r\nHowever, it is a fact that at a time when the\r\ninternational community faces new challenges stemming\r\nfrom the end of the cold war, our Organization will\r\nincreasingly be asked to play a more central role in world\r\naffairs. Naturally this means that meaningful\r\nimprovements must be made in the work of the\r\nOrganization; most importantly, the principle of\r\nuniversality should be implemented methodically and\r\neffectively. Accordingly, the restructuring and\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council must remain a\r\npriority goal. This central body of the United Nations\r\nmust reflect in its decision-making process the concerns\r\nof the entire membership of our Organization. Its reform\r\nmust lead to increased transparency and a better\r\nrepresentation by all regions of the world.\r\nGuided by the ideal of the universality of the United\r\nNations, Senegal supports the request of the Republic of\r\nChina to be admitted to membership in our Organization,\r\nand, generally speaking, to membership in the specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations system. It is inarguable, in\r\nour opinion, that that State, in view of its socio-economic\r\nperformance, its development level, its commitment to\r\ndemocratic values and its behaviour in international\r\naffairs meets all the criteria and conditions set forth by\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations for admission to\r\nmembership. This admission to membership, should it\r\noccur, would make an important contribution to\r\nstabilizing international relations in that part of Asia and\r\nwould allow for an unprecedented economic, technical\r\nand cultural cooperation among the countries of South-\r\nEast Asia and Africa. Its admission would in no way\r\njeopardize the efforts made by the international\r\ncommunity for peace and development in the world.\r\nThe values of peace, freedom and economic and\r\nsocial justice, which 50 years ago inspired the creation of\r\nour Organization, must now more than ever remain the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nbasis of our common action towards a life of dignity for all.\r\nThe post-cold-war experience has taught us once again that\r\nthe many facets of underdevelopment remain a serious\r\nthreat to international peace and security.\r\nNow that globalization and interdependence are\r\nphenomena recognized by all, we must understand that the\r\ndestiny of humankind is one and indivisible. This obvious\r\ntruth must persuade us to seek, in a spirit of solidarity, joint\r\nsolutions to the persistent problems of underdevelopment.\r\nThe series of major world conferences set to conclude next\r\nNovember with the World Food Summit — a positive\r\ninitiative welcomed by my country — is an encouraging\r\nsign of the international community’s resolve to meet these\r\nchallenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world,\r\non the basis of a comprehensive, integrated approach to\r\nhuman development.\r\nWe need now to maintain and strengthen that spirit by\r\nmobilizing additional financial resources, without which the\r\ncommitments undertaken will remain a dead letter, which\r\nwould betray the legitimate hopes to which they gave rise.\r\nWe must find an early and comprehensive solution to the\r\nsevere debt crisis. The components of the problem are fairly\r\nclear today. The sustained structural-adjustment efforts\r\nmade by our country will remain futile and ineffective if\r\nexternal factors such as the debt burden and the\r\ndeterioration of the terms of trade continue seriously to\r\nhinder our development prospects.\r\nThe Agenda for Development gives us a new\r\nopportunity to reaffirm our commitment to world peace and\r\nstability by defining a comprehensive framework for action\r\nbased on economic justice, social well-being, the protection\r\nof human rights and the preservation of the environment.\r\nThe development of Africa, and I cannot\r\noveremphasize this point, is the primary responsibility of\r\nthe Africans themselves. That is why in many African\r\ncountries today Governments continue with determination\r\nto carry out bold and difficult reforms, reflected, inter alia,\r\nin the improved and more rational use of public funds, in\r\nthe opening of our economies to international trade and in\r\nthe creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise\r\nand to the transparent management of public affairs with,\r\nmost importantly, all sectors of society participating in the\r\nwork of national development, in the interests of all. In this\r\nregard, we must pay tribute to the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund for the assistance and support they have extended to\r\nour countries. For these ongoing efforts to be successful,\r\nthey must be supported by increased official development\r\nassistance, substantial debt relief and by the lifting of\r\nbarriers and other protectionist measures. These three\r\nareas require dynamic action on the part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nSenegal is firmly convinced that we can combat\r\nAfrican pessimism if we are resolved jointly to promote\r\na mutually beneficial partnership for the recovery of an\r\nAfrica with enormous potential, which, if tapped, would\r\noffer our partners real opportunities. It was this\r\nconviction, let us recall, that prompted the Head of State\r\nof Senegal, His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf, to take the\r\ninitiative during his first term of office as Acting\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity, to request\r\nthe convening for the first time of a special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to discuss the economic situation in\r\nAfrica. That is the light in which my country sees the two\r\ninitiatives devoted to Africa: the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and\r\nthe Special Initiative for Africa, launched by the\r\nSecretary-General in March 1996.\r\nFurthermore, we noted that the mid-term review of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica at this session gave a very frank assessment of\r\nwhat must be done to make this project a genuine\r\nframework for multilateral cooperation and a source of\r\ninspiration for a fruitful partnership for development.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to touch on the United\r\nNations financial crisis, which has become a source of\r\nmajor concern for all our States. Since the causes of the\r\nsituation have been discussed at length in this very Hall,\r\nI do not believe it is necessary to recall them. However,\r\none thing is very clear. At a time when our Organization\r\nis committed on several fronts, both to restoring peace\r\nand to strengthening its role as the primary framework\r\nand instrument for the advent of the new world order, its\r\nfinancial stability is essential to enable us jointly to meet\r\nthe major challenges ahead.\r\nTherefore, my country, Senegal, would like once\r\nagain to appeal to all Member States regularly to meet\r\ntheir financial obligations. In this regard, it is essential\r\nthat the credibility of the United Nations not be impugned\r\nat a time when, individually and collectively, we have\r\nsuch high hopes for the future of humankind.\r\nOnce again, the effectiveness of the United Nations\r\nwill depend upon our common resolve to harmonize our\r\nown interests to achieve our shared goals in strict\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\naccordance with the fundamental principles of the San\r\nFrancisco Charter.\r\nAs our President, His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf,\r\nhas said repeatedly, Senegal will continue, as it has in the\r\npast, to work tirelessly for the attainment of the ideals of\r\npeace, justice and solidarity, and to reaffirm and seek\r\ncompliance with all the principles on which a true\r\ninternational community, sharing a common destiny, is\r\nbased.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Israel, Mr. David Levy.\r\nMr. Levy (Israel) (interpretation from French): Allow\r\nme first, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his\r\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. I\r\nwould also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral, for the outstanding manner in which he carried\r\nout his duties.\r\nThe succession of Governments, which is a defining\r\nprinciple of Israeli democracy, has recently brought to\r\npower a new Government in Israel. A section of the\r\ninternational community has deemed this democratic Israeli\r\nchoice impertinent, suggesting that it would work against\r\nregional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like to\r\nmake a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest for\r\npeace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekers\r\non one side and mischief-makers and people who reject\r\npeace on the other. In Israel, those on the left and right\r\nconverge in their quest for peace, their sensibilities and\r\ndifferences notwithstanding.\r\nI wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arab\r\npeace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regarding\r\nthe practice of peace in Israel and to show that the new\r\nmajority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achieve\r\npeace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a founding\r\nlandmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. The\r\nMadrid Conference, to which I had the honour of\r\ncontributing, also bears the special stamp of the pioneers of\r\npeace, to whose achievements the new majority in Israel are\r\nthe direct heirs.\r\nThe firm commitment of the Netanyahu Government\r\nwith respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to the\r\npeace process, which our immediate neighbours, Egypt and\r\nJordan, helped to shape. However, my Government’s swift\r\nengagement in the peace process has been minimized,\r\nreduced and distorted. The meetings that the Prime\r\nMinister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel\r\nand I have had with the Chairman of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority have been met with sarcasm and given only\r\nsecondary importance. Those meetings dealt precisely\r\nwith the substance and the content of peace. They\r\ninitiated the ways and means necessary for the\r\nachievement of peace. They amplified the resonance of\r\nthe Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinian\r\nrecognition to new sections of society and Israeli political\r\nclasses. It is Israel’s determination to reach peace\r\naccording to the policies and fundamental guidelines of\r\nthe new Government.\r\nOn its road to peace, the Government of Israel is\r\nguided by several principles, which I would like to\r\nexpound. For us, security is neither an obsession nor a\r\nblind belief. It touches upon our very existence in a\r\nregion where, unfortunately, threats and instability still\r\nrage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architecture\r\nof peace. It cannot, under any circumstances, tag along\r\nbehind a process in which terrorism and violence have not\r\nyet spoken their last word.\r\nNegotiations themselves, through their joint creative\r\nenergies, allow us to control the dangers and drifts. The\r\nbattle against terrorism and its infrastructures and its\r\nsources of financing and assistance is not only for us to\r\nfight. We solemnly call upon the United Nations\r\nrelentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. It\r\nis imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peace\r\nprocess free from violence.\r\nI have just returned from the Washington summit,\r\nheld at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf of\r\nthe Government and the people of Israel, I wish, from this\r\nrostrum, to thank the President and the Secretary of State\r\nof the United States for their exemplary contribution to\r\npeace by bringing the parties together and for their\r\nprofound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.\r\nIn this respect the role and contribution of the United\r\nStates remain of great importance.\r\nOn Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams will\r\nconvene again in an attempt to resolve their differences in\r\nrespect of the various agreements. We are responsible to\r\nour people and to our whole region in this matter. We\r\nmust therefore display good faith and mutual\r\nunderstanding in order to fulfil our mission, and to send\r\nout the message of stable peace and lasting security.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nThe Washington summit reconfirmed the principles\r\nand guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myself\r\nwholeheartedly with President Clinton’s statement that face-\r\nto-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are the\r\nkey to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and the\r\nrenunciation of violence: these represent the very basis of\r\nmutual efforts for peace.\r\nThe choice is in our hands. Will we opt for\r\ncooperation, progress, real peace and security? Or will we\r\nrevert to the dark days of conflict, confrontation and\r\nviolence, thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part,\r\nIsrael has chosen hope.\r\nAnother major principle in our search for peace is the\r\nwill of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.\r\nRegional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peace\r\nand stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economic\r\nhegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation of\r\nregional cooperation. This is a basic principle of\r\nnormalization. Peace and normalization are one and\r\nindivisible. Consequently, if we are to follow the logic of\r\npeace and dialogue, we cannot risk having normalization\r\ntaken hostage and brought to a halt.\r\nIsrael makes no secret that normalization of its\r\nrelations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.\r\nThis means comprehensive political and economic relations,\r\nand the broadest possible intellectual, cultural and spiritual\r\nacceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as a\r\nbody foreign to the region. Normalization must erase\r\nforever the residue of this ideological negation.\r\nNormalization is the indispensable cement for keeping\r\ntogether the edifice of peace.\r\nOne of our immediate goals is the resumption of\r\nnegotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madrid\r\nprinciples, which inaugurated the dialogue between the two\r\ncountries. We recognize Syria’s important role in the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace in our region. From this\r\nrostrum, we call upon President Al-Assad to resume\r\nnegotiations.\r\nAs to Lebanon, we have no territorial disputes with\r\nLebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanon\r\ncan be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence and\r\nthe building of peace.\r\nEgypt and its President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, are our\r\npartners in peace. They are the authors and actors that have\r\nalways been engaged in all stages of the peace process.\r\nJordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in the\r\nbuilding of peace in our region. A man of peace and\r\ndialogue, His Majesty King Hussein has actively\r\nsupported the peace process and has provided a vital\r\nguarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyed\r\nhis complete support.\r\nOn the long path to peace, the country of Morocco,\r\nthe country of my birth and family roots, has always\r\nwalked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arab\r\nreconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty King\r\nHassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-\r\nIsraeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue his\r\nessential role and breathe into peace the remarkable\r\ninspiration of his solidarity.\r\nI would like to pay tribute also to the active support\r\nof Tunisia. Oman, Qatar and, more recently, Mauritania\r\nhave all helped to consolidate peace efforts.\r\nThe peace process has benefitted from the\r\nconsiderable support of the co-sponsors, the United States\r\nand Russia, and from the active and positive contribution\r\nof the European Union and Norway and of Powers such\r\nas Japan and Canada.\r\nOnce again, I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel’s\r\nirreversible commitment and determination to pursue the\r\npath of peace.\r\nSince the dawn of history our region has been a\r\nmeeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures, a\r\nvibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At the\r\ncrossroads of continents and countries, the Middle East\r\nmust, in times of peace, discover again the genius of this\r\nplace and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabs\r\nand Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom to\r\nregenerate their vocation as the promoters of life and\r\nhumanity.\r\nThrough international cooperation, Israel is sharing\r\nwith young countries from Africa to Asia, from Latin\r\nAmerica to China, its achievements and assets in the\r\nfields of agriculture, health and science.\r\nWe hope that the day will come when a regional\r\nsecurity system will be established in the Middle East to\r\nprovide a cooperative multilateral response to all security\r\nproblems. The advantage of this regional approach is that\r\nit is based on direct negotiations between the States of the\r\nregion. The first stage is to build confidence, and\r\nthereafter we must put arms control and disarmament\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nmechanisms into place. For this reason, Israel welcomed the\r\nestablishment of the Arms Control and Regional Security\r\nWorking Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hope\r\nthat in the future this framework will encompass all States\r\nof the Middle East.\r\nIsrael’s position is defined by a dual mandate: to set\r\nambitious objectives, and to pursue them pragmatically and\r\nrealistically. After peace and reconciliation have been\r\nestablished among all the States of the region, Israel will\r\nendeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free of\r\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as\r\nballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected to\r\nrigorous verification.\r\nNegotiations to establish such a zone will commence\r\nfollowing the signing of bilateral peace accords between\r\nIsrael and all the countries of the region. In the meantime\r\nIsrael will implement confidence-building measures that\r\nwill increase openness and transparency and, thereby, make\r\na contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armed\r\nconflict.\r\nWe generally prefer regional security arrangements.\r\nHowever, Israel is in favour of the implementation of\r\ncertain aspects of international mechanisms for arms control\r\nand disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly, Israel\r\nsigned the Convention on conventional weapons and\r\nadopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export of\r\nanti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treaty\r\nagainst the use of chemical weapons and now the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel will\r\nconsider ratification of that Treaty depending upon\r\ndevelopments in the region, particularly the adoption of that\r\nTreaty by the major countries.\r\nIsrael has thus demonstrated its determination to be\r\ninvolved, whenever possible, in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to prevent the spread of\r\nconventional and non-conventional weapons.\r\nIsrael strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledged\r\nmember of the family of nations represented in this\r\nOrganization. We note with regret and deep disappointment\r\nthat the question of our membership in a regional group has\r\nstill not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the right\r\navailable to all States Members of the United Nations to\r\nparticipate on an equal footing in all its activities. This\r\nimpairs the principle of equality among sovereign nations\r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that this\r\ninjustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be able\r\nto act within this Organization on the same footing as all\r\nother Member States.\r\nIt is with the subject of Jerusalem, whose very name\r\nis invoked in so many prayers for peace, that I wish to\r\nconclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three great\r\nreligions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting and\r\nensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expression\r\nfor all believers. It is an entirely shared religious reality\r\nto which Israel has made a profound contribution.\r\nJerusalem, the horizon of our dreams and prayers,\r\nhas throughout our exile and dispersions constituted the\r\nsummit of our collective being. Capital of Israel, both in\r\nancient and modern times, never has Jerusalem been the\r\ncapital of any country other than Israel.\r\nRarely if ever has any sovereign State been denied\r\nthe right to freely determine its capital. Israel, the people\r\nof peace restored to sovereignty after 2,000 years of exile,\r\nhas returned to the city of peace, Yerushalayim:\r\nJerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswerving\r\ndevotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm of\r\npeace: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”. We shall\r\ntirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call next on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Tourism and International Transport of\r\nBarbados, Her Excellency The Honourable Billie Miller.\r\nMs. Miller (Barbados): It is my pleasure to\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. The Barbados delegation shares fully the\r\nconfidence expressed in his leadership and assures him of\r\nits cooperation in the work of this Assembly.\r\nLet me also warmly commend his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his\r\noutstanding stewardship of the fiftieth session, including\r\nthe Special Commemorative Meeting on the occasion of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. That\r\ncelebration, which brought together 128 Heads of State or\r\nGovernment, stands as a fitting memorial to the historic\r\nevent.\r\nMy country’s knowledge of and appreciation for the\r\nUnited Nations system has deepened since we had the\r\nhonour to host the United Nations Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates in 1994. The Barbados Declaration and Programme\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nof Action outlined the way forward for the relationship\r\nbetween small island developing States and the international\r\ncommunity. The Barbados Conference was the first and to\r\ndate the only follow-up Global Conference to the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development,\r\nbecause it was recognized that small island developing\r\nStates have a critical role to play in sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBarbados and other members of the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States will unremittingly pursue the follow-up to the\r\nProgramme of Action because our survival depends on it.\r\nWe have, however, been disappointed to note that so much\r\nof the promise of the Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States\r\nhas as yet gone unfulfilled, and we will engage the\r\ninternational community further to ensure that our concerns\r\nare addressed.\r\nBarbados welcomes the coming into force of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the\r\nestablishment of the International Seabed Authority and the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. This new\r\nregime for the world’s oceans is of particular interest to us\r\nand to small island developing States in general, because of\r\nthe critical link between the maritime environment and our\r\nland mass. Small island developing States are in some ways\r\njust coastal zones, and as such have a particularly intimate\r\nrelationship with the oceans, upon which we depend for\r\nfood and which are pivotal to our tourism industry.\r\nIt is in this context that we view with apprehension the\r\nuse of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear\r\nand other hazardous materials. While we understand the\r\nneeds of countries to dispose of and reprocess waste\r\nmaterials, and we recognize their right to do so under Law\r\nof the Sea, International Maritime Organization and\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency regulations, we fear\r\nthe consequences of accidents for an environment which is\r\nso highly fragile. The Caribbean presents a unique\r\ncombination of factors which demand that it be treated with\r\nspecial care: large numbers of small island developing\r\nStates, a semi-enclosed sea subject to violent seasonal\r\nstorms, and the presence of one of the most intensively\r\nused shipping passages, the Panama Canal. The Heads of\r\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community have repeatedly\r\ndeclared their opposition to the use of the Caribbean Sea\r\nfor trans-shipment of nuclear materials. We look forward to\r\ndeepened dialogue with flag States and other concerned\r\nStates and organizations to ensure that we are all aware of\r\nwhat is being shipped, when and where, and how best to\r\nmanage it.\r\nThe vulnerability of Caribbean micro-States is\r\nfurther increased by narco-trafficking. This illicit trade\r\nthreatens the very existence of our democracies, a point\r\nthat was reinforced earlier this year when the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme held a\r\nconference in Barbados on drug enforcement and\r\nrehabilitation cooperation in the Caribbean.\r\nRegional cooperation is the responsible and effective\r\nmeans for implementing international agreements dealing\r\nwith this matter. The response of the international\r\ncommunity to our peculiar set of problems has been\r\nencouraging, but it must continue to be upgraded. We\r\nsuffer not so much because we are major end-users, but\r\nbecause of our strategic location in this traffic. We will\r\ncontinue in our efforts, with the limited resources we\r\nhave at our disposal, to ensure that the drug traffic does\r\nnot undermine the foundations of our democracies. We\r\nwill not stand accused of not cooperating with our\r\npartners, but neither will we allow our hard-fought\r\nsovereignty to be sacrificed in the tug-of-war between the\r\nmoral and societal imperative to curtail demand and the\r\nneed to reduce supply.\r\nAs we herald the International Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty, this delegation is appalled that in\r\n1996, despite the advances in technology and the new\r\nwealth being generated by the forces of globalization,\r\nmillions of children still do not have access to the most\r\nbasic necessities.\r\nJust as we argued at the Second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) that\r\nhumankind has a right to housing, Barbados fully supports\r\nthe notion that individuals have a right to adequate\r\nnourishment. We look forward to the World Food Summit\r\nlater this year in Rome as being the catalyst for major\r\nchange towards alleviating hunger.\r\nWomen are among the most impoverished groups in\r\nour societies, and gender equality is a major vehicle for\r\nachieving sustainable human development. Although\r\nBarbados ranks high on the human development index,\r\nparticularly as it relates to gender equality, the Beijing\r\nPlatform for Action remains for us a critical policy and\r\naction framework.\r\nThe landmark fiftieth session was an occasion for\r\nsolemn reflection on the mission and performance of the\r\nUnited Nations and for a constructive assessment of the\r\nchallenges which confront the Organization in the post-\r\ncold-war world. Member States have left no doubt about\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nthe critical role that the United Nations must continue to\r\nplay in fostering global peace and security and promoting\r\nsustainable development. They have recognized that,\r\nnotwithstanding its shortcomings, this Organization remains\r\nthe only universal mechanism which offers the hope of\r\nachieving the goals for humanity enshrined in its Charter.\r\nThe task with which we have been charged is to revitalize\r\nthe United Nations and to strengthen its capacity to meet\r\nthe new demands of rapid global change. My delegation\r\ntherefore attaches the greatest importance to the Working\r\nGroups established by the General Assembly to advance the\r\nreform process, in order to make the world a more peaceful\r\nplace and to improve the Organization’s effectiveness in\r\npromoting economic and social development.\r\nReform is now the order of the day. No country or\r\ninstitution can neglect the reality of globalization or the\r\ntechnological revolution that drives this process. It poses\r\nmajor challenges for countries and societies, particularly\r\nsmall developing countries. We recognize only too well our\r\nown vulnerability to marginalization, stemming from\r\nintense global competition and reform of major global\r\ninstitutions, including the United Nations. Barbados\r\ntherefore follows with special interest the consultations\r\ntaking place in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. The question of equitable\r\nrepresentation of small States is of particular concern, and\r\nwe are studying closely those proposals which take this\r\nconcept into account. At the same time, we note with\r\nsatisfaction the broad convergence of views on enlargement\r\nof the Council, and the importance being given to measures\r\nto improve its working methods and procedures, to enhance\r\nits democratic and representative character, and to foster\r\ngreater transparency.\r\nWe also recognize the important consultations which\r\nare proceeding in the other Working Groups. When this\r\ntask is successfully completed, we envisage a United\r\nNations restructured and re-energized, to accelerate\r\neconomic and social development in a world where absolute\r\npoverty still afflicts over one billion people who exist on\r\nless than one dollar a day.\r\nCommitment to reform notwithstanding, the capacity\r\nof the Organization to support this global agenda is being\r\nhampered by recurring financial crises. The United Nations\r\nnow finds itself at the crossroads. In April 1996, the\r\nSecretary-General cautioned that the United Nations was on\r\nthe brink of financial disaster. Regrettably, this outlook has\r\nnot markedly improved to date. Given this prospect, it is\r\nclear that resolute action to address this crisis can no\r\nlonger be postponed if the integrity of the Organization\r\nand the viability of its mandates are to be preserved. In\r\nour view, we have debated far too long obligations which\r\nare so clearly spelt out in the United Nations Charter.\r\nBarbados holds firmly to the position advanced by\r\nthe Group of 77 and China that the crisis derives\r\nessentially from the Organization’s cash flow problem,\r\ncreated by the failure of major Member States to pay their\r\ncontributions in full and on time. More generally, we\r\nsupport the principle of periodic review of the scale of\r\nassessments, designed to ensure the long-term financial\r\nviability of the United Nations, based on the principle of\r\ncapacity to pay; but we do not believe that this should be\r\nlinked conditionally to the issue of arrears as we search\r\nfor a solution to the present crisis.\r\nThis Assembly will once again review the many\r\nunresolved problems which dominate the global political\r\nscene. The world still awaits the dawn of the new era of\r\npeace envisaged at the end of the cold war. As a small\r\ndeveloping country, Barbados is ever conscious of the\r\npeaceful domestic climate it has enjoyed since\r\nindependence in 1966, which has fostered its economic\r\nand social development. We therefore share the anguish\r\nof the international community for those countries where\r\ninternal strife and regional conflict, and their attendant\r\nhuman suffering, continue to deny economic and social\r\nprogress to millions of their people.\r\nMy delegation therefore welcomes the peace process\r\nwhich is being implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nunder the Dayton accords. Though still fragile, this\r\nAgreement, we think, offers the best prospects for peace\r\nso far, and we hope for an end to a conflict which has\r\nthreatened the very credibility of the United Nations. We\r\nhope that the recent elections will be a further major step\r\nin the building of the confidence and trust so crucial to\r\nlong-term reconciliation.\r\nRecent outbreaks of violence in the Middle East\r\nhave renewed our anxieties about peace in that region.\r\nThe international community yearns for the day when a\r\nfull and lasting peace is consolidated in this entire region,\r\nbringing to an end the long cycle of violence. We urge all\r\nthe parties to re-embark on this journey and redouble their\r\nefforts to recapture the momentum of the peace process,\r\nwhich has so far brokered agreements between Israel and\r\nEgypt, Jordan and Palestine.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nIn Africa, a number of countries remain locked in\r\nprolonged conflict, which has smothered the democratic\r\nprocess and stalled the development effort. We urge the\r\ninternational community to do all it can to stem the\r\nexplosive situation in the Great Lakes region. Without\r\npeace there can be no development, and without\r\ndevelopment there can be no lasting peace. We therefore\r\nhope for an early breakthrough for peace in affected\r\ncountries, not only in Africa but also in other regions of the\r\nworld, so that the urgent task of development can be\r\nresumed.\r\nIn our own hemisphere, the situation in Haiti continues\r\nto be of special concern to countries of the Latin American\r\nand Caribbean region. Thanks to the resolve of the Haitian\r\npeople and the support of the international community, a\r\nviable political and development infrastructure has begun to\r\ntake root. It holds the promise of nurturing the still-fragile\r\ndemocracy and accelerating economic and social progress\r\nwhich has eluded the majority of the Haitian people for too\r\nlong. Speaking on behalf of member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community during consideration of this question\r\nat the fiftieth session, Barbados cautioned that the road\r\nahead for Haiti would be long and difficult, that progress\r\nwould be uneven, and that sustained support from the\r\ninternational community would continue to be crucial.\r\nWe believe that this view is still valid. My delegation\r\ntherefore welcomes the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1063 (1996) of 28 June 1996, which established\r\nthe United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until 30\r\nNovember 1996. It will provide continuing support to\r\nsecure and maintain a stable environment that will buttress\r\nthe democratic and development process. However, come\r\nnext month, the international community cannot wash its\r\nhands of Haiti, declare victory and leave. As recent events\r\nhave shown, stability, to say nothing of democracy, remains\r\na fragile sapling that will continue to require care and\r\nprotection. We urge that Haitians, who were among the first\r\nin this hemisphere to attempt to define their own post-\r\ncolonial political system, not be forgotten in the post-cold-\r\nwar world.\r\nDeveloping countries look to a reformed United\r\nNations to play a major role in shaping the global society\r\nof the twenty-first century. It must build on the\r\nconsiderable policy consensus that already exists on the\r\nbroad priorities of its agenda, including the link between\r\npeace and development, poverty eradication, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, social justice and democracy, issues of\r\ngovernance, and women. It must continue to nurture the\r\nparticipatory impulse of civil society, which has emerged as\r\na major influence on the work of the Organization and on\r\nnational public policy. It must propel this heightened\r\nconcern with the human condition in all its dimensions to\r\nthe top of the global agenda.\r\nBarbados shares these priorities for full human\r\ndevelopment by fostering the empowerment of all its\r\npeople as it expands its economic and social development.\r\nAt the same time, it has taken steps to review and deepen\r\nits democratic and human rights traditions through the\r\nestablishment of Commissions on Social Justice and\r\nReform of the Constitution, respectively. These inquiries\r\nwill assess the extent to which the promise of a good and\r\njust society has been fulfilled after 30 years of\r\nindependence. They reflect the fact that we assign the\r\nhighest priority to social policy and to the cause of human\r\nrights and democracy.\r\nThe United Nations faces many challenges, but these\r\nare not insurmountable if we renew our faith in its\r\nmission. Barbados believes that this Organization is still\r\nour best hope for fostering peace and social justice and\r\nfor coordinating the management of global problems.\r\nGiven the agenda before us, we believe this is a time for\r\nmore, not less, intensive global cooperation —\r\ncooperation that only the United Nations can foster. We\r\nremain committed to its principles and will do our part to\r\nhelp fulfil the promise of the Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain,\r\nShaikh Mohamed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa.\r\nShaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset, I have the pleasure of extending to\r\nMr. Razali Ismail and to his friendly country, Malaysia,\r\nmy sincere congratulations on his election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. I wish him\r\nsuccess in conducting the proceedings of the session and\r\nassure him of my delegation’s readiness to cooperate fully\r\nwith him in achieving our Organization’s objectives and\r\npurposes.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express my thanks and\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral, for his sincere efforts in guiding the proceedings\r\nof the previous session.\r\nIt is also my pleasure to express my country’s\r\ngratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless and dedicated\r\nefforts to enhance the Organization’s role and standing\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nand to further the Charter’s objectives, especially those\r\nrelated to the maintenance of world peace and security. I\r\nhope that he will continue to hold this important position\r\nand to do this good work.\r\nThis session convenes a year after the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, which was celebrated in\r\nthe middle of a decade that has, from the start, witnessed\r\nrapid changes and diverse trends arising from the remnants\r\nof the cooperation and cold-war conflict that have marked\r\nhalf a century.\r\nThe international community has dealt with the\r\nchallenges this historic burden with a twofold response.\r\nFirst, it has sought to reform and develop the United\r\nNations system so as to enable it to fulfil its role in the\r\nlight of these changes. Secondly, it has made concerted\r\nefforts by convening world conferences to deal with critical\r\nissues relating to the future of mankind, such as the\r\nenvironment, development, population, trade, social\r\ndevelopment, women and children. Despite these efforts,\r\nwhich have continued for several years, this twofold\r\nresponse has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills\r\nthat have slowed the progress and political, economic and\r\nsocial development of the human race.\r\nGiven the way the United Nations was established and\r\nthe manner in which the international system has evolved\r\nsince the 1940s, this phenomenon should not come as a\r\nsurprise. The international community has been unable to\r\nabsorb the intense impact of the major transformations of\r\nthe present decade, which have relied heavily on the\r\nfoundations and parameters of the current system of\r\ninternational relations. This means that the international\r\ncommunity still needs some time — not necessarily a\r\nlittle — in which to fathom the similarities and diversities\r\nof national interests that influence the contemporary\r\ninternational political system.\r\nIn order to be able to understand these political\r\nramifications in their historical context, we must consider\r\nthis phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and\r\ninflexibility that characterize the structure of the\r\ncontemporary system of international relations. That is\r\nbecause the crisis afflicting current international political\r\nrelations has been caused largely by the persistence of\r\ncomplex political and historical dilemmas that have\r\ncontinued to interact within a system of international\r\nrelations based on visions formulated by the allies before\r\nthe end of the Second World War.\r\nThe Powers that are influential in the international\r\narena presently appear to be reviewing the basis on which\r\nthe present international system was founded, with a view\r\nto reconfiguring, rather than abolishing, current and future\r\nglobal imperatives. The underlying purpose of the system\r\nthat emerged in the 1940s was fundamentally to address\r\nregional and international security problems in all their\r\npolitical and economic dimensions. It is a fact that the\r\nAllied Powers formulated their vision in the 1940s on the\r\npremise that security and stability in the regional context\r\nwere basically associated with the creation of a number of\r\ninternational institutions, most notably the United Nations,\r\nits specialized agencies and the financial institutions that\r\ncame into being as a result of agreements reached at a\r\nnumber of historic conferences.\r\nDespite this association and the new intellectual,\r\npolitical and economic trends brought about by the\r\nchanges, the structural notions of the international system\r\nhave not developed in tandem with the requirements of\r\nhuman development, as manifested by the\r\ncommunications revolution, the exchange of ideas, the\r\nflow of information and the technological applications\r\nthat have influenced international relations in various\r\nways.\r\nThe historical concept of the link between national\r\nand regional security could serve as an appropriate\r\nstarting point for a comprehensive review and redefinition\r\nof the question of security in all its aspects. In spite of\r\nthe importance of the administrative and financial reform\r\nof the United Nations, its specialized agencies and other\r\norgans, the influential Powers have not given the question\r\nof collective security adequate attention with a view to\r\ndeveloping ways and means to preserve international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe international community truly must expand the\r\nscope of the principle of collective security if States are\r\nto be free from the fear of strategic threats to their\r\nnational and regional security. It is my conviction that the\r\nSecurity Council, as the sensory nerve-centre of the\r\nUnited Nations, in addressing the questions of world\r\nsecurity, should be guided by certain collective security\r\nprinciples that could be activated in the current\r\ncircumstances. Furthermore, it is possible to increase the\r\nuse of practical preventive diplomacy to prevent the\r\neruption of conflicts by containment and by speedily\r\neliminating their causes.\r\nIn view of the importance now being attached to the\r\nquestion of collective security, thought should be given to\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nthe development of mechanisms for maintaining relations\r\nbetween the Security Council and regional organizations, in\r\naccordance with United Nations purposes and principles.\r\nThis is relevant to some particularly important regions of\r\nthe world, such as the Arabian Gulf region, which is\r\nafflicted by tensions that threaten the established\r\nfundamentals of the region’s security.\r\nTo insure the region’s security and stability, it is\r\nimperative that relations among all States of the region be\r\nbased on the principles of good-neighbourliness, mutual\r\nrespect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and\r\nrecognition of every State’s national sovereignty. The\r\nterritorial and border claims that are currently being made\r\nin the Arabian Gulf region, and are aimed at changing\r\nestablished and traditionally accepted boundaries, upset the\r\nsecurity and stability of the region. We believe that the\r\noptimal and most judicious course for avoiding that\r\nprospect is to respect the status quo, refrain from any\r\nclaims — total or partial — and to settle any consequential\r\ndifferences by peaceful means acceptable to the parties to\r\nthe dispute.\r\nWith regard to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait,\r\nthe State of Bahrain, being keen to maintain security and\r\nstability in the Gulf region, stresses the need for Iraq to\r\nmeet fully the requirements of international legality and\r\nfulfil its obligations under the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, including the release of Kuwaiti and other\r\nprisoners of war.\r\nWhile it asserts that care should be given to ensuring\r\nthe unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq,\r\nBahrain welcomes the signing of the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding between Iraq and the United Nations and\r\ncalls for the accelerated implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 986 (1995) on the issue of “oil for food”, an\r\nessential step towards alleviating the suffering of the\r\nbrotherly Iraqi people.\r\nOn another matter, the continued occupation by the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran of the three islands of Greater\r\nTunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — all of which belong\r\nto the United Arab Emirates — is a cause of concern for\r\nBahrain and other member States of the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, in view of the serious ramifications for the\r\nsecurity and stability of the region and good-neighbourly\r\nrelations among its States.\r\nThe State of Bahrain therefore calls upon the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran to respond urgently to the appeals of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates to solve the question of these islands\r\nthrough serious bilateral talks and other means available\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes through\r\nreconciliation among States.\r\nEconomic security is also fundamental to a world of\r\nsecurity and peace. In recent years, significant\r\ndevelopments have taken place in the sphere of\r\ninternational economic relations as a result of the\r\ninterdependence that has come to characterize the world\r\neconomy, especially since the establishment of the World\r\nTrade Organization. Over the past four decades, the\r\nUnited Nations has addressed development problems,\r\nissued a number of declarations and formulated a number\r\nof strategies in this respect, but the desired results have\r\nbeen elusive.\r\nWe believe that development challenges to any\r\ncountry can be met only by taking into account the global\r\neconomic system as a solution that involves the\r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive framework combining\r\ninternational and local efforts, with a view to improving\r\nthe performance of the economy in a favourable\r\nenvironment wherein local and regional circumstances and\r\nthe priorities and special conditions of each individual\r\nState are taken into consideration.\r\nThe topic of the ninth session of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development, held this year in\r\nSouth Africa, was the promotion of sustainable growth\r\nand development in the context of the globalization and\r\nliberalization of the world economy. This reflects a global\r\ninterest in addressing the shortcomings of the world\r\neconomy. In this connection, we would like to emphasize\r\nthe importance of the role of the Organization in the\r\nenhancement of solidarity and interdependence for the\r\nsake of promoting development in all countries.\r\nWith regard to the Second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements, held at Istanbul this\r\nyear, it is our hope that the principles, commitments and\r\nplan of action of the Conference will be implemented. It\r\nis also our hope that the World Food Summit, to be held\r\nin November in Rome, will make recommendations to\r\nensure and enhance world food security.\r\nEnvironmental problems continue to be a cause of\r\nconcern for the human race in view of their potential\r\nthreat to our planet. Agenda 21, adopted at the United\r\nNations Conference of Environment and Development, is\r\na framework for the protection of the environment.\r\nPersuaded that collective action is important for the\r\nprotection of the environment, the State of Bahrain has\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\npaid special attention to the issue of the environment.\r\nAccordingly, an Emir’s decree approving Bahrain’s\r\naccession to the Convention on Biological Diversity and\r\nanother on environmental law were issued. The latter\r\nestablishes an environmental body that can exercise all\r\nauthorities with respect to environmental planning and\r\npolicies and the supervision of their implementation.\r\nThe third element, in our view, is social security,\r\nwithout which societies would be unable to sustain human\r\nprogress or protect national security. As far as the people\r\nare concerned, it is an important precondition for the\r\nachievement and preservation of peace and security within\r\nand among States. This fact was stressed by the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen last\r\nyear.\r\nResponsibility for social development is based on two\r\npivotal factors: national responsibility and collective\r\ncommitment, as reflected in the combined efforts of the\r\ninternational community. In this connection, it must be\r\nmentioned that the ability of societies to effect social\r\ndevelopment is fundamentally connected to the objectives\r\nof economic progress and comprehensive development in\r\nall their human dimensions. Any international commitment\r\nto preserve the stability and security of societies within the\r\nframework of economic and social development should take\r\ninto consideration the cultural content of social development\r\nand the various national factors.\r\nThe State of Bahrain — in the light of its conviction\r\nthat peace in the region is a strategic alternative that must\r\ninevitably be based on justice, the restoration of rights and\r\nthe prevalence of security — follows closely and with deep\r\nconcern the new developments in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess. Peace is the only course that can lead to\r\nreconstruction, prosperity and the well-being of the peoples\r\nof the region. It can end the cycle of violence and war\r\nwhich the region has suffered for so long.\r\nThe progress achieved in the context of the Madrid\r\nConference, whose underlying principles were the\r\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\r\naccordance with international legality and the principle of\r\n“land for peace”, should continue without regression. We\r\nmust build on it.\r\nThe State of Bahrain views with deep concern the\r\nserious events that have taken place in the past few days as\r\na result of the policies of the present Israeli Government.\r\nThese are manifest in its perpetuation of the occupation and\r\nits refusal to honour the agreements made and to withdraw\r\nfrom occupied Arab territories in Palestine, the Syrian\r\nGolan Heights and southern Lebanon, as provided for in\r\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions, in\r\nparticular resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\r\n(1978), as well as in the Madrid terms of reference,\r\nwhose underlying principle is “land for peace”.\r\nWe call upon the international community, in\r\nparticular the two sponsors of the peace process, and the\r\nStates of the European Community to persuade Israel to\r\nend its repressive practices against the Palestinian people\r\nand to resume negotiations on the final status of the\r\nPalestinian territories in accordance with the agreements\r\nconcluded between the two parties. They should also\r\nstress the necessity of resuming negotiations on the Syrian\r\nand Lebanese tracks. These negotiations should aim at\r\nachieving just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\r\nregion and at insuring the attainment by the Palestinian\r\npeople of their legitimate rights. These include their right\r\nto establish their own independent State, with Jerusalem\r\nas its capital, and the complete withdrawal of Israel from\r\nall Arab territories, including the occupied Syrian Golan\r\nHeights up to the boundaries of 4 June 1967 and occupied\r\nsouthern Lebanon.\r\nWithout doubt, in violating the principles upon\r\nwhich the peace process is based, reneging on the\r\nagreements and commitments reached within the\r\nframework of this process and procrastinating in the\r\nimplementation thereof, Israel will drastically set back the\r\npeace process and lead the region back into a new cycle\r\nof tension and violence.\r\nIt is regrettable that Israel continues periodically to\r\nact repressively against the Palestinian people and\r\nrepeatedly to violate the sanctity of Islamic holy places.\r\nWe denounce the Israeli authorities’ opening of a tunnel\r\nbeneath Islamic archaeological sites. This is calculated to\r\njudaize and efface the Islamic features of the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories. This act has caused indignation and\r\nanger in the occupied Palestinian territories in particular\r\nand in the Islamic world in general. It is a hostile act\r\ndirected against the holy Islamic sites and a provocation\r\nagainst the sentiments of Arabs and Muslims.\r\nIn condemning Israeli practices and repressive\r\nactions, which have resulted in scores of deaths and\r\nhundreds of injuries, we demand that Israel end these\r\npractices and forswear its plans to change the Arab and\r\nIslamic character of the city of Jerusalem or to violate the\r\nsanctity of the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to urge and pressure the Israeli\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nGovernment to renounce political policies of expansion and\r\nsettlement in Arab territories and to comply with the\r\nrequirements of peace and security in the region.\r\nWe consider the conclusion of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to be one of the most important\r\nissues in the field of disarmament. We look forward to the\r\nday when we can feel secure because all nuclear tests have\r\nbeen ended and all nuclear weapons eliminated. Bahrain\r\ntherefore signed the Treaty last week because it considers\r\nit a step in the right direction of eliminating these weapons.\r\nThe elimination of all weapons of mass destruction is\r\nbound to enhance confidence and security at both the\r\ninternational and regional levels. We have supported the\r\ninitiatives seeking to make the Middle East, including the\r\nArabian Gulf region, a zone free of nuclear weapons and\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Bahrain has done so in the\r\ndeep conviction that the security and stability of the region\r\nshould be maintained, that the region should be saved from\r\nthe calamity of these weapons of mass destruction and that\r\nthe States of the region should be able to implement\r\ndevelopment projects and raise the standard of living of\r\ntheir peoples. In this connection, I would like to applaud\r\nthe signing of the Pelindaba Treaty in Cairo on 11 April\r\n1996, which established Africa as a Nuclear-Weapon-Free\r\nZone.\r\nTerrorism in all forms is a global phenomenon whose\r\nthreat today is not confined to a particular people or region,\r\nbut endangers security and peace in numerous countries.\r\nBahrain has repeatedly denounced and deplored this\r\ndangerous phenomenon in more than one international\r\nforum. Its eradication requires cooperation and the\r\ncoordination of efforts. Bahrain now calls for concerted\r\nefforts for the implementation of the Declaration on\r\nMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism, adopted at\r\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It also\r\ncalls for cooperation in the identification of terrorist\r\nactivities, their prosecution, the adoption of deterrent\r\nmeasures and preventing terrorist organizations from using\r\nthe territories, information media and facilities available by\r\nvirtue of the respect given to civil liberties in certain\r\ncountries, in order to mount hostile activities against other\r\ncountries.\r\nThe State of Bahrain would like to express its\r\ngratitude and appreciation to the sisterly and friendly States\r\nthat lent their support at a time when it was the target of\r\nforeign-aided terrorist acts aimed at disturbing the security\r\nand stability enjoyed by our State and other Arabian Gulf\r\nStates. The events witnessed in the State of Bahrain and\r\nother States in the region and throughout the world\r\ndemonstrate the extent of the danger of terrorism and how\r\nfar the terrorist elements can go in manipulating laws and\r\ninternational human-rights principles to serve their own\r\nsubversive and terrorist ends.\r\nThe fighting in Somalia and Afghanistan has brought\r\ndevastation and destruction to the peoples of the two\r\ncountries. With a view to sparing the lives of innocent\r\npeople, we appeal anew to all parties to the conflict in\r\neach of the two Islamic countries to embark on a serious\r\ndialogue to reach a political settlement of their\r\ndifferences.\r\nWe welcome the outcome of the elections that took\r\nplace in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of\r\nthe Peace Agreement signed in Paris as a result of\r\nnegotiations held in Dayton in 1995.\r\nWe support all efforts to restore peace and stability\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, urge respect for the\r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that\r\ncountry and emphasize the necessity of economic\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation as a means to buttress\r\nthe peace process.\r\nWith regard to the question of Cyprus, we call upon\r\nthe United Nations to continue its contacts with the\r\nparties concerned so that direct talks can be resumed with\r\na view to reaching a final settlement.\r\nThe question of the development and reform of the\r\nUnited Nations is in the forefront of issues that have\r\ncaptured the attention of Member States. Extensive\r\ndiscussions on this matter have taken place over the past\r\nfew years, especially in relation to the question of\r\nequitable representation on the Security Council. It is our\r\nview that the reform of the Security Council is not only\r\na matter of institutional dimensions and ramifications, but\r\nthat it also constitutes a challenge that the international\r\ncommunity should address thoughtfully.\r\nThe State of Bahrain has consistently supported the\r\nSecurity Council and its role in and contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It has\r\nalso joined the international community in the\r\nimplementation of resolutions relevant to international\r\nlegality and related commitments. Bahrain is the host\r\ncountry for the Field Office of the Special Commission\r\nestablished under Security Council resolution 687 (1991)\r\nand has provided the Office with all the facilities needed\r\nfor the successful performance of its duties. In this\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nrespect, the State of Bahrain wishes to recall with\r\nappreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization, submitted to the General\r\nAssembly at its current session, in which he praises the\r\nsupport given by the Government of Bahrain to the\r\nactivities and work of the Office.\r\nSince it joined this Organization, the State of Bahrain\r\nhas always adhered to the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and therefore looks forward\r\nto playing a more active role in this regard. The nomination\r\nof Bahrain to Security Council membership for the period\r\n1998-1999 — which received the unanimous endorsement\r\nof the Group of Asian States, the League of Arab States\r\nand the Gulf Cooperation Council and the support of other\r\nMember States — is a confirmation of its standing as a\r\npeace-loving State and an indication that it wishes to play\r\na more active role in the maintenance of world peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe characteristic distinction of the late twentieth\r\ncentury is that relations among nations are based on\r\ninterrelated, mutual and diverse interests in various political,\r\neconomic and social fields. This interrelatedness of interests\r\nhas formed a sort of common culture among nations and\r\nhas created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideas\r\nand the tools of knowledge, thus enabling cultural and\r\nintellectual interaction among peoples of the world and\r\nenhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of world\r\npeace and security, an objective which the United Nations\r\nhas sought to achieve over the past five decades.\r\nIn view of this fact, it behooves us to lend the\r\nOrganization support and encouragement so that it may be\r\nable to play its role in a civilized world and carry out its\r\nnoble tasks of ensuring the achievement of world security,\r\nprosperity and peace.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina\r\nFaso, His Excellency Mr. Ablassé Ouédraogo.\r\nMr. Ouédraogo (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Like some others present here, I too have had the\r\nopportunity to visit Malaysia. Malaysia is a great country,\r\nboth in size and because of its outstanding successes in\r\nmany areas. But it is a great country above all because of\r\nthe quality of the women and men who govern it and who\r\nrepresent it on the international scene. Ambassador Razali\r\nIsmail is without doubt one of its most eminent\r\nrepresentatives. I am therefore convinced that he will\r\npreside over the work of our 51-year-old Organization with\r\ngreat cheer and efficiency. I convey to him and to all the\r\nelected members of the Bureau my congratulations and\r\nbest wishes for success.\r\nI would also like to congratulate his predecessor,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, whose personal qualities\r\nand wealth of experience guided the work of the historic\r\nfiftieth session in an exemplary manner. We wish to\r\nconvey our great gratitude to him.\r\nFinally, I pay well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his outstanding\r\nefforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations and\r\nfor the talent and tenacity with which he has guided the\r\nOrganization in these difficult times.\r\nIn July 1996, the Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity adopted\r\nin Yaoundé, Cameroon, a declaration expressing its\r\nappreciation for and stressing the work done by\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the helm of the United\r\nNations. According to tradition and the rules of fairness,\r\nAfrica is entitled to a second mandate, which we hope\r\nwill come about.\r\nThe current trends on the international scene are\r\ndisquieting. The sovereign equality of States and the\r\nprinciple of free trade are being damaged by unilateral\r\nmeasures, despite the fact that the General Assembly of\r\nthe United Nations has reaffirmed these principles and the\r\nstrict respect that should be accorded to them. Moreover,\r\nwe are facing a financial crisis that is essentially caused\r\nby the default on payments of assessed contributions due\r\nto the Organization. The overwhelming majority of\r\nspeakers who have preceded me have said that this\r\npractice is unacceptable, particularly on the part of those\r\nwho have the capacity to pay.\r\nThe procedures and decision-making process of the\r\nSecurity Council are still fairly opaque, despite some\r\nminor openings. The geographical origins of the\r\npermanent members run counter to the principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution. The cause of this is\r\nhistorical, but this perception is now more widespread and\r\nstark, 51 years after the creation of the Organization. Yet\r\ntoday, through the deliberations and decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council, a veritable body of substantive\r\ninternational law, armed with sanctions and strewn with\r\nad hoc tribunals, is emerging. After 51 years, the General\r\nAssembly, the pedestal and guarantor of this structure,\r\nfinds itself stripped of its powers and even of its\r\nfunctions.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nWe cannot compare the General Assembly to the\r\nSecurity Council but recent developments in these two\r\nbodies have accentuated their differences instead of\r\nemphasizing their complementarity, which is not a healthy\r\nsituation. Ironically, this situation coincides with the\r\nvehement, ongoing clamour for transparency and democracy\r\neverywhere. The reform of the United Nations system is\r\nunderstood in various ways and we have yet to find the\r\nformula that can be supported by everyone. Difficulties\r\narise from the demands of some and the reluctance of\r\nothers. Clearly, reform must be a joint effort or it will not\r\ncome about. We are concerned because all of these\r\ncombined factors might encourage the disturbing trends to\r\nwhich I referred earlier.\r\nIndeed, the financial situation of the United Nations is\r\ncentral to the significance and future of our Organization.\r\nAn institution, a community of men and women, can be\r\ncreated by force — can, for a time, be maintained by\r\nforce — but it is not force that makes them last. The idea\r\nof leadership is based on the ability to take decisions as\r\nwell as on moral authority. Moral authority is based on the\r\nability to convince the majority in a lasting and complete\r\nway. To be followed without conviction is to run the risk\r\nof abandonment as soon as short cuts can be safely taken.\r\nThe joint aspiration of the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations was, is and must remain that of following\r\na common path beneficial to all. It is no coincidence that in\r\nthe Charter, drafted at the end of a conflict in which\r\nPowers imposed themselves on other Powers, spirit and\r\nletter came together so that States large and small could\r\nfeel involved as much in the responsibilities and decision-\r\nmaking as in the outcome. Hence the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of States, who assumed that, regardless\r\nof their size or importance, each should participate to the\r\nbest of its ability in the functioning of the Organization\r\nbecause, in this way, each worked equally to attain the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. Nor is it a\r\ncoincidence that those which bore a greater burden in this\r\nrespect were given a privilege in the Security Council,\r\nthough it was to be exercised on behalf of all and for the\r\nbenefit of all.\r\nWhat is happening nowadays? The United Nations is\r\nunique. It is political. Its role and its objectives are very\r\nspecial. How can we, therefore, try to see it as a company\r\nwhose shareholders want to move it in a particular direction\r\non the basis of the number of shares they hold? How could\r\nwe continue to call ourselves United Nations? The United\r\nNations has charge over destinies and people. It is also an\r\ninstitution that must be managed, but one in which\r\neveryone has a place.\r\nI have dwelt at length on this point because Burkina\r\nFaso is a community of men that understands, appreciates\r\nand supports the fact that the United Nations is\r\nirreplaceable. It is an instrument which has no equal and\r\nwe desire a world of fraternity and progress.\r\nAfrica is fighting for its development, although beset\r\nby crises and conflicts, such as those in Liberia and\r\nBurundi. In Liberia, after the events of April 1996, the\r\nsummit meeting of the Committee of Nine and a certain\r\nopen-mindedness on the part of faction leaders calmed the\r\nsituation, permitted the nomination of a new Head of\r\nState in the person of Ms. Ruth Perry, opened up\r\nprospects for the holding of elections. We encourage this\r\ntrend.\r\nIn Burundi, a military coup d’état swept away\r\ncivilian rule, but the fraternal States of the subregion\r\nrejected fait accompli by ordering sanctions. We are\r\ntherefore concerned by the situation in that country, which\r\nhas already been traumatized by numerous ethnic\r\nconflicts. The international community should pay heed\r\nto that and provide resources.\r\nTurning to the subject of Taiwan, Burkina Faso\r\nwould refer to the principle of universality in the matter\r\nof representation of 22 million people. We hope that an\r\nad hoc committee will be established.\r\nPoverty is on the rise. It is the result of the policies\r\nof the countries that control the markets. Poverty is also\r\nthe consequence of unequal distribution among the\r\ndeveloping countries. In all cases, statements on both\r\nsides very often sound like incantations crashing against\r\nthe wall of cold implacable reality. The idea of\r\nglobalization, paradoxically, goes hand in hand with that\r\nof fragmentation, both political and economic. The world\r\nconferences held over the past six years have promoted\r\nthe concept of partnership. We still need to give that\r\nconcept real content and weight. Unfortunately, we still\r\npossess neither of these despite real efforts by some\r\npartners of the North. Invective, tirades of complaint and\r\nexhortations have not advanced the debate nor brought us\r\ncloser to the right solutions.\r\nFrom 16 to 20 September 1996, we held the mid-\r\nterm review of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. We thank\r\nAmbassador Owada and his country, Japan, for their\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\ninterest in the development of Africa. However, we must\r\nacknowledge that the results of our negotiations with our\r\nother partners continue to fall short of our expectations,\r\nneeds and priorities, although Africa has largely met its\r\ncommitments. The same goes for the mid-term review\r\nundertaken by the United Nations Children’s Fund on the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Children. Increased\r\nresources are necessary and expected.\r\nSelf-control is the beginning of wisdom, but it is not\r\nenough without an enabling environment. From the\r\ndiscussions in the Uruguay Round to the creation of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization, this point is constantly being\r\nborne out. Solidarity, the key word, must prevail and guide\r\nour actions if we want a global village, not just a series\r\nof enclaves that are more or less fortunate and in the long\r\nrun condemned to mutual destruction.\r\nMultilaterlism could prevent that fate, especially\r\nsince we are now seeing that the State is surrendering\r\ncontrol over certain elements of its sovereignty.\r\nEverywhere, structures and organizations with varying\r\ndegrees of legality are transcending States and\r\nestablishing transnational networks and relations. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that we keep pace with these trends\r\nand adapt now and in the future our special instrument,\r\nour common instrument: the United Nations at the service\r\nof peoples. Political will is what will make the difference.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
