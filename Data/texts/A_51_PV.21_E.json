(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Slovakia, His Excellency Mr. Pavol Hamžík.\r\nMr. Hamžík (Slovakia): I would like to express my\r\nsincere congratulations, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency, and my best wishes for success in the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish also to thank your predecessor, Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral, for his leadership and his personal\r\ncontribution to the positive achievements of last year’s\r\nsession.\r\nLast year we commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations. That was a good opportunity not only\r\nfor historical reflection and drawing lessons from the past,\r\nbut also for setting out new priorities and tasks for the\r\nyears to come. It is obvious that the United Nations, if it is\r\nto meet expectations, has to adapt itself to meet new\r\nchallenges. Slovakia supports all efforts that will contribute\r\nto the enhancement of democracy, transparency and\r\nefficiency in the work of the United Nations.\r\nThe need for the reform of the United Nations is also\r\nconfirmed by its current difficult financial situation. This\r\nstate of affairs can be resolved only if all Member States\r\nmeet their financial obligations in a timely manner and\r\npay their arrears, and if a new formula for determining a\r\nmore adequate scale of assessments based on a country’s\r\ncapacity to pay is adopted. In this context, Slovakia\r\nappreciates the European Union proposal for the financial\r\nreform of the United Nations and welcomes an open and\r\npragmatic discussion in this regard.\r\nLet me stress that Slovakia, which has paid its\r\ncontributions to the United Nations regular budget in full\r\nand on time, is also ready to bear its fair share of\r\nresponsibilities in financing United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations. Now, more than three years after our\r\nadmission to United Nations membership, it is high time\r\nSlovakia was fairly allocated to an appropriate group for\r\nthe financing of United Nations peace-keeping. Bearing\r\nin mind the available economic data and comparing them\r\nwith those of several other countries of the Central\r\nEuropean region, we are fully convinced that Slovakia\r\nshould be allocated to Group C, and we see no\r\ncompelling reason for further postponing this decision. Of\r\ncourse, such a decision would be without prejudice to a\r\ncomprehensive review process of the method to be\r\napplied for the apportionment of the expenses of United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations. But the contributions\r\nof any Member State for 1993-1997 should be assessed\r\nonly on the basis of the scheme applicable in that period.\r\nIn the context of United Nations institutional reform,\r\ngreat attention is focused on the Security Council.\r\nSlovakia supports Security Council reform and is of the\r\nopinion that the expansion of its membership should\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nreflect the principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation. The membership of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States has recently more than doubled, and this\r\nfact should be duly taken into account in the Security\r\nCouncil reform process. Countries able to bear global\r\nresponsibility should be granted the status they deserve in\r\nthe Security Council. On the other hand, expansion of the\r\nmembership should hamper neither the efficiency nor the\r\ndecision-making process of the Security Council, so the\r\nincrease should be a rather limited one.\r\nSeveral inspiring proposals have been submitted to the\r\nUnited Nations. Slovakia is of the opinion that we should\r\nlook for the positive elements contained in those proposals\r\nand make maximum efforts aimed at reaching a generally\r\nacceptable solution. Practice has shown that an increased\r\nrole for small and medium-sized countries in the Security\r\nCouncil can contribute favourably to the effective\r\nimplementation of its decisions, thus improving the\r\nauthority and the democratic character of that body.\r\nSlovakia actively supports the United Nations efforts\r\nto maintain and strengthen international peace and security.\r\nAfter three years of difficult negotiations, the Slovak\r\nRepublic has finally become a full-fledged member of the\r\nConference on Disarmament, thus filling the vacancy\r\ncaused by the dissolution of the former Czechoslovakia.\r\nSlovakia, as a country using nuclear power solely for\r\npeaceful purposes, unequivocally supports all steps which\r\nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and create\r\nconditions for their eventual elimination. Therefore, we\r\nwelcomed last year’s decision of the fifth Review\r\nConference to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This September we voted\r\nfor the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty. Last Monday I had the honour to sign it on behalf\r\nof the Slovak Republic. We hope that it will soon enter into\r\nforce and become law in international relations, thus\r\nmaking the world safer.\r\nThe world community is also paying close attention to\r\nanother important disarmament agreement — namely, the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention. Slovakia has already\r\nratified this important instrument and supports a speedy\r\nresumption of the ratification process so that it can enter\r\ninto force.\r\nWe consider the problem posed by anti-personnel\r\nlandmines a serious one. We therefore welcome initiatives\r\naimed at a ban on the use, stockpiling, production and\r\ntransfer of this kind of weapon. For our part, we have\r\nalready unilaterally declared a moratorium on the export\r\nof these devices, which cause casualties mostly among the\r\ninnocent civilian population.\r\nPeace-keeping operations continue to be a major part\r\nof United Nations activities. Slovakia sees their further\r\ndevelopment through the enhancement of elements of\r\npreventive diplomacy, with a significant strengthening of\r\ntheir humanitarian dimension and a broader incorporation\r\nof civilian components at all stages. Practical evidence of\r\nSlovakia’s efforts to implement the basic United Nations\r\ngoals is our participation in the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja\r\nand Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and the United Nations\r\nAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).\r\nSlovakia, as a troop-contributing country,\r\nunderstands the significance of appropriate protection for\r\nUnited Nations personnel. Therefore, we have already\r\nratified the Convention on the Safety of United Nations\r\nand Associated Personnel. The brave men and women in\r\nblue helmets deserve stronger protection. We call upon all\r\nother States which have not yet become parties to the\r\nConvention to ratify it as soon as possible.\r\nThe European continent was the theatre of two world\r\nwars in the past. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to\r\npay great attention to the issues of security and peace in\r\nthis part of the world. Underestimating the gravity of the\r\nsituation caused an immense human tragedy for millions\r\nof innocent people in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia. The Dayton Agreements, and above all their\r\nsuccessful implementation, represent a turning point\r\ntowards a peaceful settlement of this traumatic conflict,\r\nnot only for its direct participants but also in a global\r\ncontext. The international community also plays an\r\nirreplaceable role in this process through United Nations\r\nmechanisms. Slovakia is ready to get fully involved in the\r\nreconstruction of the destroyed economies of the countries\r\nof the region. We welcome Security Council resolution\r\n1074 (1996), adopted just two days ago.\r\nMaintaining peace and security in other parts of the\r\nworld is of no lesser importance. Preserving the\r\ncontinuity of the peace process in the Middle East is an\r\nimportant part of that. We must not allow the peace\r\nprocess to end and the results achieved so far to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\nWe observe with concern the growth of instability\r\nand the spread of conflicts on the African continent.\r\nSlovakia supports all efforts by the United Nations, the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nOrganization of African Unity and other organizations\r\ninvolved in the search for peaceful solutions for eliminating\r\ncrises and violence.\r\nSlovakia supports the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\nto achieve a durable solution to the question of Cyprus that\r\nwill guarantee respect for the sovereignty, independence,\r\nterritorial integrity and unity of the country, in compliance\r\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions. My country is\r\nprepared to continue its mission of good offices by\r\norganizing meetings of the political party leaders of both\r\nCypriot communities.\r\nAs far as humanitarian assistance is concerned, we\r\nemphasize the need for the efficient mutual cooperation of\r\nall involved entities, together with a strengthening of the\r\ncoordinating role of the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs. Early warning as one element of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and the rapid reaction of the international\r\ncommunity in response to an emerging crisis situation are\r\nfactors which significantly affect overall results. The role of\r\nthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs in the\r\nreconstruction of territories suffering from military\r\nconflicts, including in demining, is important.\r\nInternational conflicts and internal strife are not the\r\nonly threats to international security and the stability of\r\nStates. Increasingly, acts of terrorism and organized\r\ntransnational criminal activities undermine democratic\r\nsocieties and become their joint enemies. We strongly\r\nsupport international cooperation aimed at their suppression\r\nand elimination. We will study with interest several timely\r\ninitiatives put forward during this General Assembly\r\nsession, such as the initiatives of Poland, the United\r\nKingdom and the United States. We are convinced that\r\ngranting observer status to INTERPOL in the General\r\nAssembly will have a positive impact on the activities of\r\nboth organizations in this field and will enable closer\r\ncooperation.\r\nHuman rights will undoubtedly continue to be high on\r\nthe United Nations agenda. Full respect for human rights is\r\na prerequisite for freedom, justice, stability and peace. We\r\ncommend the efforts to increase the efficiency of the\r\nUnited Nations human rights programmes, the work of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and his policy goal\r\nof transforming the Centre for Human Rights into an\r\noverall coordinator of human rights policy and action within\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nIn less than four years of statehood, Slovakia has\r\nestablished a system of democratic institutions. All\r\ncommitments under the relevant human rights instruments\r\nhave been incorporated into its legislation. Our country\r\nrespects the rule of law and guarantees all citizens within\r\nits jurisdiction respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, including for the individual rights of persons\r\nbelonging to national or ethnic minorities.\r\nWe have established an inter-ministerial coordinating\r\ncommittee for women’s issues as an advisory body to the\r\nSlovak Government. It is designed to initiate and monitor\r\nthe implementation of the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen.\r\nFamily issues are very closely interlinked with the\r\nrights of women and the rights of the child. In today’s\r\nworld, the family requires better protection and\r\npromotion. A strong family is a basis for a sound society.\r\nAn international centre for family studies has been\r\nestablished in the Slovak capital. We are interested in\r\nsigning a memorandum of understanding between the\r\nGovernment of the Slovak Republic and the United\r\nNations on the promotion of family issues through the\r\nBratislava International Centre for Family Studies and the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nSustainable economic and social development is a\r\nsine qua non for full enjoyment of human rights and the\r\ndecent life of mankind on all parts of the globe. We\r\nwelcome the new, integrated and comprehensive focus of\r\nthe United Nations on these issues, as reflected in the\r\nseries of United Nations conferences and summits held\r\nduring the term of office of the current Secretary-General.\r\nHe deserves his share of credit for their success. Now and\r\nin the years to come, we have to concentrate on the\r\nimplementation and review of the recommendations,\r\nconclusions and plans of actions adopted in Rio, Vienna,\r\nCairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul. We consider the\r\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly\r\nin 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 a\r\ntimely course of action. As a new member of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development we will pay\r\nspecial attention to these activities.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council should play a key\r\nrole in fostering international activities for sustainable\r\neconomic and social development; its coordinating role is\r\nneeded. We support efforts to enhance the efficiency of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and to streamline its\r\nprocedures. Its sessions should be more focused on\r\ntopical issues. The relationship with its functional\r\ncommittees requires further reflection and improvements.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nUnnecessary duplication in the work of the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council should be\r\navoided. The consideration of economic issues in the\r\nSecond Committee and social ones in the Third Committee\r\nseems nowadays an increasingly artificial separation. As\r\nthese issues are interlinked, it would only benefit us to find\r\na proper remedy for this artificial separation. This may\r\nrequire a new redistribution of responsibilities among the\r\nMain Committees.\r\nA close interconnection between environmental issues\r\nand economic development is reflected in the process of\r\neconomic transformation in Slovakia. Economic\r\ndevelopment in Slovakia has reached a new level, and the\r\nfoundations for the transition to a market economy are now\r\nfirmly laid. This can be seen in the positive economic\r\nresults achieved in 1995, when Slovakia ranked second\r\namong the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, with a\r\nreal annual gross domestic product growth of 7.4 per cent.\r\nThe Slovak economy is closely linked with the\r\ndevelopment of regional and world economies. As a\r\nfounding country of the World Trade Organization,\r\nSlovakia is actively participating in the ongoing integration\r\nprocess and the formation of a new trade system on the\r\nregional and multilateral levels. In this context, the\r\ncooperation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement\r\ncountries may be an example worth following in the\r\nintegration of countries into the multilateral trade system\r\nand global economy. We see the Central European Free\r\nTrade Agreement not only as a vehicle to promote trade\r\nbetween its partners, but also as a step on the road to full\r\nintegration into the European Union in the future, which is\r\none of our foreign-policy priorities, together with\r\nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) and in the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development.\r\nWe welcome the positive results of the ninth session\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), which stressed the need for the\r\nimprovement of cooperation with the WTO and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. The reform of its intergovernmental\r\nstructure, the focus on a smaller number of priorities with\r\na view to integrating developing countries into the\r\ninternational trade system, should lead to a renewal of the\r\nstatus of UNCTAD in the global economy.\r\nThe forthcoming Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in\r\nSingapore will be a good opportunity to further strengthen\r\nthe Organization’s regulatory role. Slovakia also places\r\nparticular importance on cooperation with other United\r\nNations agencies. We are interested in actively\r\ncontributing to the improvement of their functioning.\r\nI am convinced that the United Nations will prove\r\nits viability in the future, as it has so far, and confirm its\r\nunique role in the community of nations. The Slovak\r\nRepublic is prepared to do its utmost for this goal.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister of the Solomon Islands, His Excellency\r\nthe Honourable Danny Philip.\r\nMr. Philip (Solomon Islands): As we begin the\r\nsecond half of the United Nations first century, we are\r\npresided over by a diplomat whose distinguished career\r\nhas included service in four of the world’s five great\r\nregions. He has demonstrated skill and ready humour in\r\nhis work as the Permanent Representative of Malaysia. I\r\nnote with some amazement his most recent achievement:\r\ngetting this Assembly to begin each meeting promptly on\r\nschedule. This bodes well for our efforts here.\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal presided over the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly with the intellect\r\nand distinction characteristic of his career as a\r\nparliamentarian and teacher of law. We are in his debt.\r\nLast year, I saluted the Secretary-General, as well as\r\nthe women and men of the Secretariat, the specialized\r\nagencies and other bodies of the United Nations for their\r\nextraordinary work during this difficult time in the\r\nOrganization’s history. The Solomon Islands applauds\r\nthem all. It is difficult to persevere in the face of harsh\r\nand unjustified criticism and insufficient financial\r\nresources while engaged in the complex task of\r\nrevitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of a\r\nworld in rapid transformation.\r\nThis morning, on behalf of the Solomon Islands, I\r\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT). I was especially pleased to do so because\r\nnuclear-weapons testing and disarmament are critical\r\nissues for the people of my country. During the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, the Solomon Islands\r\nworked with its sister States of the South Pacific Forum\r\nand the Pacific basin for the adoption of resolution 50/70\r\nA on nuclear testing. Noting the international alarm over\r\nrecent nuclear tests and the potential negative effects of\r\nunderground nuclear testing on health and the\r\nenvironment, the General Assembly deplored all nuclear\r\ntesting and called for its immediate cessation.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nThe islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean were the\r\nsites of nuclear tests for 50 years. Peoples were displaced\r\nand fragile environments destroyed. We welcome the end\r\nof the nuclear-weapons tests, but when will the States who\r\nconducted them accept their responsibility for providing\r\nlong-term damage assessments and aid for resettlement and\r\nthe restoration of economic productivity?\r\nSolomon Islands also welcomes the signature of\r\nTonga, as well as the signature and ratification by the\r\nRepublic of Vanuatu, of the South Pacific Nuclear Free\r\nZone Treaty and the signing of its Protocols by France, the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.\r\nLast November, the judges of the International Court\r\nof Justice heard two weeks of argument to assist them in\r\nrendering the Advisory Opinion requested by the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session on the question: Is the\r\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstances\r\npermitted under international law? The Solomon Islands\r\nworked closely with the Marshall Islands and Western\r\nSamoa in developing and presenting to the Court, in\r\ncooperation with other States, the case that the use of even\r\nthe smallest nuclear weapon would violate international\r\nlaw, particularly humanitarian law. The landmark Opinion\r\nrendered by the Court on 8 July largely supported our\r\nposition. Regrettably, the nuclear Powers that argued\r\nagainst us at the International Court of Justice see it\r\notherwise. We look forward to the debate on the Advisory\r\nOpinion, which is on the agenda thanks to the initiative of\r\nMalaysia.\r\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the creation of\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zones in Africa and South-East Asia,\r\nthe finding of the International Court of Justice, the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of the CTBT — whatever its\r\nshortcomings — and the report of the Canberra\r\nCommission indicate that a momentum exists for\r\nestablishing targets and timetables for the elimination of all\r\nnuclear weapons. Although the majority of States support\r\nthis, such States have no forum in which they can develop\r\ntheir ideas and formulate a strategy. Solomon Islands\r\nproposes the creation of a forum of non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates. Committed to the elimination of nuclear weapons,\r\nthe forum would seek agreement on a unified approach to\r\nthe full implementation of article VI of the NPT and\r\nmonitor progress towards that end. Moreover, the forum\r\nwould work to give effect to arrangements such as the\r\nsouthern hemisphere nuclear-weapon-free zone and linked\r\nregional nuclear-weapon-free zones that could evolve into\r\na global nuclear-weapon-free system.\r\nSolomon Islands endorses the statement made here\r\nlast week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nMarshall Islands on behalf of the South Pacific Forum.\r\nSolomon Islands, a member of the South Pacific Forum\r\nministerial committee on New Caledonia, welcomes the\r\nprogress facilitated by France and the relevant parties in\r\nimplementing the Matignon Accords.\r\nFor the small island States of the Pacific, the\r\nenvironment, development and international trade are\r\nmatters of critical concern. The development of\r\ncomprehensive arrangements for the sustainable\r\nmanagement of our region’s fisheries is urgently needed.\r\nSolomon Islands will soon sign and ratify the Agreement\r\nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly to be\r\nconvened in 1997 to review Agenda 21 is also of great\r\nimportance to Solomon Islands. We seek practical ways\r\nto improve ongoing regional efforts to meet the Agenda’s\r\ngoals.\r\nThe second assessment report of the\r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a call to\r\nthe international community to speed up negotiations,\r\nrecognizing that such a global problem demands a\r\ncollective solution. Solomon Islands continues to support\r\nthe Alliance of Small Island States Protocol to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. If\r\nlower greenhouse gas emissions are not achieved soon,\r\nthe very survival of small island developing States will be\r\nthreatened. Moreover, the sustainable management and\r\nconservation of our forests are essential for the biological\r\ndiversity and economy of the country.\r\nIn the Pacific, where healthy coral reefs are essential\r\nfor effective coastal zone management, we are\r\ncollaborating in the international coral reef initiative and\r\nwill take part in our region’s Year of the Coral Reef in\r\n1997. As valuable as these efforts are, what remains to be\r\ndone is formidable. The recent report to the United\r\nNations Commission on Sustainable Development on\r\nactivities to implement the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction in the Pacific region shows the range and\r\nmagnitude of the problems the citizens of the small island\r\ndeveloping States face.\r\nThe future of the Solomon Islands must depend on\r\na people-centred development strategy that uses a bottom-\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nup and top-down process of decision-making. With a\r\npopulation of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic\r\nand linguistic origins, 80 per cent of whom live in rural\r\nsettings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600\r\nkilometres of ocean, no other system is workable. A major\r\nchange in our system of provincial government is designed\r\nto maximize rural community participation in planning and\r\ndecision-making. Overseas development assistance could,\r\ntherefore, be directed to where it is most needed. We are\r\nfostering public health, literacy and electrification. That is\r\nwhy the recent completion of our first solar-powered village\r\nis important for us. In implementing the Habitat Agenda,\r\nwe are encouraging self-reliance in village development.\r\nSolar and other renewable energy resources, such as water\r\nand wind, will further our economic, education and health\r\ndevelopment plans.\r\nSeveral weeks ago, the Internet reached the Solomon\r\nIslands. Personal computers in a growing number of our\r\nsecondary schools and the possibility of lap-top computers\r\nin the hands of teachers and students give new hope for my\r\ncountry’s future. We are now using the World Wide Web\r\nto introduce the country to potential investors and tourists.\r\nPeace in our region is essential for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Solomon Islands encourages the efforts of\r\nPapua New Guinea to resolve its Bougainville crisis\r\nthrough constructive dialogue with all the parties concerned.\r\nThe confidence-building measures have reduced the tension\r\nacross the border between Papua New Guinea and Solomon\r\nIslands.\r\nSolomon Islands, which patiently follows the debates\r\non reforming the United Nations, recognizes the difficulties\r\ninherent in making the Organization more effective. We\r\nsupport an increase in the non-permanent membership of\r\nthe Security Council on a regional basis and thank Italy for\r\nits valuable proposal. If the number of permanent members\r\nis also to be enlarged, the responsibilities of permanent\r\nmembership and the criteria for the use of the veto must be\r\nestablished and made transparent.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary Declaration called for the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, the\r\nuniversal organ of the States Members of the United\r\nNations. Proposals have been put forward and debated.\r\nCalls for reducing the length of the agenda continue to echo\r\nthrough these halls. Yet, in the past few weeks, we have\r\nseen how vital the General Assembly can become when a\r\ndelegation skilfully and vigorously presses forward with a\r\ngreat issue and effectively marshals the support of many\r\nMember States. I refer to the extraordinary work of\r\nAmbassador Richard Butler and his Australian colleagues\r\nin mobilizing overwhelming support for the adoption of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\r\nWhen the will and commitment are present, the General\r\nAssembly can act with brilliant effectiveness, winning the\r\napplause of a world hungry for security, peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\nSuch an achievement need not be rare. As the\r\nuniversal organ of the Member States, the General\r\nAssembly should be a force for democracy, transparency\r\nand universality. For example, the Charter permits the\r\nGeneral Assembly a much larger role in the selection of\r\nthe Secretary-General than it has exercised in the past.\r\nConfronted as we are with public action in this matter by\r\none of the great Powers, should we not now seek to make\r\nthe process truly democratic and open? Can we afford to\r\nleave this essential issue to last-minute bargaining behind\r\nclosed doors? Twenty-five years ago, the General\r\nAssembly at its twenty-sixth session adopted resolution\r\n2837 (XXVI), which recognized the unquestionable value\r\nof the general debate and said that it should continue to\r\nbe held every year and that the time devoted to it should\r\nbe utilized to the maximum.\r\nThe general debate offers a glimpse of how Member\r\nStates see the state of the world and the United Nations.\r\nListening to the statements in this great Hall, one is\r\nstruck by the spectrum of ideas and opinions they present.\r\nDiscussion would enhance their value for us, but we have\r\nnot established appropriate venues at which the views\r\noffered here could be thoroughly explored. Can we afford\r\nto deny ourselves the benefit of engaging our colleagues\r\nintellectually?\r\nTo move the General Assembly towards universality,\r\nSolomon Islands believes that substantially reducing the\r\nfloor rate in the scale of assessments, as has been\r\nproposed, would not only enable several countries in our\r\nregion to seek membership of the United Nations but\r\nwould help many developing countries to pay their annual\r\nassessments in full and on time.\r\nTwo themes have clearly emerged in our general\r\ndebate: Whatever its weaknesses, the United Nations is\r\nindispensable; but without sufficient resources and a\r\ndecisive commitment to true multilateralism, the\r\nOrganization cannot fulfil its obligations to the peoples of\r\nthe world. Solomon Islands and the other small island\r\ndeveloping States need this Organization. Whether the\r\nissue is investment, law enforcement, trade embargoes,\r\nfishing rights, hazardous waste dumping, natural disasters,\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nautonomy, independence or any combination of these, the\r\npeople of the small islands turn to the United Nations for\r\nsupport.\r\nWe and others spoke out on behalf of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan, which, barred from the United Nations\r\nand seeking unification with the People’s Republic of\r\nChina, is attempting to enlarge its contribution to the\r\ndeveloping world through this Organization. Solomon\r\nIslands hopes that unification negotiations based on the\r\nproposals each party has put forward can begin in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nThe United Nations is dealing with important issues:\r\nthe Agenda for Development, the programmes of action\r\napproved at the world conferences, technical assistance, the\r\nSecretary-General’s preventive diplomacy, the evolving\r\ninternational system for protecting human rights. In this\r\nrespect Solomon Islands especially thanks the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross for its efforts to rid the world\r\nof anti-personnel landmines and for its work caring for the\r\ndisplaced and searching for missing persons, including\r\nKuwaitis and Greek Cypriots who have still not been heard\r\nfrom, and many other people who have “disappeared”.\r\nThese are life and death matters even for those of us\r\nwho live on distant islands. Through a commitment to\r\nequity, democracy and tolerance based on multilateralism\r\nand universality, an effective United Nations will serve us\r\nall for generations to come.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Hungary, Mr. László Kovács.\r\nMr. Kovács (Hungary): May I, at the outset, extend\r\nthe congratulations of my delegation to you, Sir, upon your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfirst session. In your endeavours, based on your rich\r\ndiplomatic experience, you may count on the assistance and\r\nsupport of the Hungarian delegation.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his extremely able\r\nleadership throughout our historic fiftieth session.\r\nThe diversity of challenges facing the community of\r\nnations, the difficulties associated with finding proper\r\nresponses and the importance of building up supportive\r\nnational and international constituencies are hardly likely to\r\nsend multilateralism into oblivion. Yet, in this time of\r\nchange, and despite the forceful tendencies of globalization,\r\ninterdependence and integration, no single applicable\r\napproach is at hand for political leaders. Given its unique\r\nrole and capacities, the United Nations can be the\r\nprincipal vehicle by which the international community\r\nselects and addresses problems requiring a universal\r\nresponse.\r\nThis Organization, however, cannot and should not\r\nmicro-manage the solution to all the urgent problems of\r\nour contemporary world. Times have changed and so\r\nmust the United Nations. In several instances, the\r\ninternational community may act much more efficiently\r\nthrough regional organizations or specialized agencies.\r\nWhat is essential, however, is that the nations forming\r\nthis Organization stand up with one strong voice when the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter are put to the test.\r\nViolations of international law, human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms should be matched with legitimate\r\nand adequate responses by the international community,\r\nacting through the United Nations.\r\nThe issue of multilateral disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation remains a legitimate concern for the United\r\nNations. Last year, we were pleased by the indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. This important step not only\r\nconstituted a major building block in the complex web of\r\nour non-proliferation and disarmament efforts, but served\r\nas a catalyst to forge consensus around the future\r\ndirection and dynamics of this process. As a result of\r\nsustained and responsible work in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, it became possible to finalize the text of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\r\nHungary stood fully behind this compromise text, which\r\ncaptures the diversity of views and approaches while still\r\nconstituting a coherent and forward-looking document.\r\nOpening the Treaty for signature was, indeed, a\r\nlandmark. Hungary was among the first countries to\r\nsponsor resolution 50/245. I signed the Treaty on the day\r\nafter it was opened for signature. This Treaty is not the\r\nend of the process. There is a need for further systematic\r\nand progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation, and the CTBT must be given its due\r\nplace in that process. In this context, we join those who\r\ncall for its smooth entry into force, thereby allowing the\r\ndisarmament process to proceed.\r\nHungary also consistently seeks to contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of stability and security through cooperative\r\nefforts at both regional and bilateral levels. Building upon\r\nour intensified relations with the European Union, we\r\nlook forward to the early beginning of negotiations on our\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\naccession to the European Union. We hold the firm view\r\nthat the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) will expand stability and security in\r\nEurope and will strengthen trans-Atlantic partnership and\r\nsolidarity. Hungary, in its bilateral relations with\r\nneighbouring countries, is striving to contribute to the\r\nestablishment of conditions enabling them all to be full\r\npartners in the institutions of Euro-Atlantic integration. We\r\nremain convinced that, with an enlarged NATO and an\r\nexpanded European Union, the United Nations will have\r\neven more efficient and helpful regional partners.\r\nThe crisis in the Balkans has proved to be a painful\r\nand dramatic litmus test of the resolve of the international\r\ncommunity. The United Nations has also had to draw its\r\nown conclusions from the tragedy. The mission of the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern\r\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium is currently making\r\nprogress on the road to the peaceful reintegration of the\r\nregion into Croatia, while securing respect for the human\r\nrights of all its inhabitants and the rights of national\r\nminorities in the region. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nrole and determination of the Implementation Force (IFOR)\r\nis indispensable for guaranteeing the implementation of the\r\nDayton Agreement. The cooperation, through IFOR,\r\nbetween NATO, the United Nations, the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of\r\nEurope in responding to the different facets of this major\r\nchallenge is an innovative paradigm for future conflict\r\nresolution and crisis-management efforts.\r\nWe strongly believe that a solid international presence\r\nis required to allow democracy and stability to take firm\r\nroot in the region. Hungary continues to provide the\r\nnecessary logistical and transit facilities to IFOR forces and\r\nUnited Nations peace-keepers and is contributing to the\r\nstrength of both IFOR and the United Nations International\r\nPolice Task Force. The return and reintegration of refugees\r\nand displaced persons — including those who found shelter\r\nin Hungary — pose a continuing challenge to the\r\ninternational community. The establishment of democracy\r\nand the rule of law should be accompanied by\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation, thereby facilitating the\r\nconditions of safe and orderly return. Citizens should be\r\nassisted by the international community in their efforts to\r\ncreate and activate democratic institutions in which good\r\ngovernance and accountability will force war criminals out\r\nof the political mainstream. We see the work of the\r\nTribunal in The Hague as an essential component of the\r\nDayton peace process and the cooperation extended to it as\r\nan important indicator of the willingness of the parties to\r\nfollow through on both their Dayton commitments and\r\ntheir obligations under the Charter.\r\nExperience of the recently held elections in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina suggests that keeping to the schedule\r\nagreed at Dayton was a sound decision. We remain\r\nconcerned, however, at the ethnically divided voting\r\nresults. This only highlights the urgency of proceeding\r\nwithout undue delay to the building-up of a unique\r\ninstitutional infrastructure for the country and of\r\nfacilitating the holding of municipal elections in a more\r\nstable political environment.\r\nWe are now in a period of reflection with regard to\r\nUnited Nations conflict-prevention and crisis-management\r\ncapabilities. In our view, the United Nations, as it\r\ncontinues to live up to its responsibilities under the\r\nCharter, ought to craft its response strategies more\r\ncarefully. The preventive capacity of the United Nations\r\nshould be further strengthened. A sound early warning\r\nsystem, combining political, military, humanitarian,\r\nhuman rights and economic areas, would broaden the base\r\nof options and enhance the chances for success in the\r\nearly detection of conflict situations. An early\r\ninternational monitoring presence in itself has a major\r\ndeterrent effect. In-depth information on a given situation\r\nwould catalyse diplomatic efforts and help trigger a broad\r\nconsensus on the course of action.\r\nMr. Turnquest (Bahamas), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nSpecialized agencies and regional organizations, such\r\nas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope, are of primary importance in defusing sources of\r\ntension through creating appropriate and efficient response\r\nmechanisms. The United Nations, while fully discharging\r\nits responsibilities under the Charter for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, can authorize and thus\r\ngive legitimacy to these endeavours as well as to actions\r\nto be taken by ad hoc coalitions of the able and willing.\r\nThe building-up of regional peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding capacities, as well as the increase of the\r\noperational character of some key activities of specialized\r\nagencies, are among the avenues that have to be more\r\nfully explored.\r\nThe reform agenda of the United Nations has been\r\nput in motion against the background of these new\r\nchallenges and opportunities. Despite considerable\r\nprogress in identifying the main areas of change within\r\nthe different negotiating structures, we are seriously\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nconcerned that the overall reform process has lost most of\r\nits dynamics. While we should not allow that individual\r\nconsensual elements of the reform process be held hostage\r\nto progress in unrelated issues, there seems to be an evident\r\nneed to reach a political agreement, at least on the basic\r\nphilosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda.\r\nHungary is aware of the difficulties that make real progress\r\nso hard to achieve. It stands ready to help reinvigorate the\r\nmomentum for change and to make genuine United Nations\r\nreform an early reality.\r\nPromotion of the international protection of human\r\nrights is a fundamental component of my Government’s\r\nforeign policy and one of the essential tasks conferred upon\r\nthe United Nations by its founders. Despite the remarkable\r\nresults achieved in the standard establishment and building-\r\nup of implementation machinery, there is still much to do\r\nin maintaining our determination to act in defence of human\r\nrights, wherever abuses may occur. Chronic underfunding,\r\nlack of efficient coordination and the sometimes evasive or\r\nuncooperative attitude of several Governments only\r\nunderline this urgency, which was finally recognized when\r\nhuman rights were made one of the programme priorities of\r\nthe United Nations. In our view, the United Nations, despite\r\nthe important advances made, such as the establishment of\r\nthe post of High Commissioner for Human Rights, is still\r\nnot sufficiently equipped to deal with the latest and gravest\r\nof human-rights challenges: those emanating from ethnic\r\nconflict, civil strife, government breakdown and the\r\ncollapse of the rule of law.\r\nThe importance of safeguarding and monitoring the\r\nobservance of the rights of national or ethnic minorities is\r\nstill too often disregarded and put in the context of political\r\nexpediency. Lack of full respect for the rights of minorities,\r\ntogether with the absence of necessary political, legal,\r\ninstitutional and administrative guarantees, are among the\r\nroot causes of many of the conflicts on our agenda.\r\nToday, as we witness the growing importance of\r\nhuman-rights operational activities, the timeliness of the\r\nconcept of preventive peace-building comes to mind. This\r\nimplies not only an enhanced human-rights preventive and\r\nmonitoring capacity of the United Nations, but also the\r\nright combination and use of the assets at our disposal,\r\nfrom early warning to preventive protection. The practice\r\nof financing some United Nations human-rights field\r\noperations from the peace-keeping budget and a greater\r\ncoordinating role for the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights may be two of the avenues which deserve our full\r\nattention.\r\nI wish to underline the fact that the way in which\r\nthe United Nations tackles the crucial global problems\r\nmankind is facing will greatly determine the quality of the\r\nimminent next century. Let me refer, in this context, to\r\nthe importance of some of the problems on the agenda of\r\nthis session. Sustained efforts to combat international\r\nterrorism, transnational crime or illicit drug trafficking are\r\nrequired from all of us in order to preserve the\r\ninternational legal order, the present achievements and\r\nfurther potential of democracy and development. The\r\nUnited Nations has an important role in coordinating\r\nefforts to ensure that those involved in terrorist activities\r\nfind no safe haven and expect a vigorous response from\r\nthe international community. Transboundary criminal\r\nactivity and drug-related money-laundering require the\r\nstrict application of the law by strong, independent\r\njudiciaries. Our task is to make use of the advantages of\r\nmultilateral cooperation in this field.\r\nThe Republic of Hungary stands ready to work in\r\npartnership with Member States to promote efficient\r\nmultilateral action and to translate into deeds the noble\r\nideals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, His Excellency Chief Tom\r\nIkimi.\r\nChief Ikimi (Nigeria): On behalf of the Nigerian\r\ndelegation, I convey to Mr. Razali Ismail our\r\ncongratulations on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. His election is a\r\nrecognition of his wide-ranging experience, candour and\r\ndiplomatic skills. It is also a tribute to his great country.\r\nWe are confident that, under his presidency, the work of\r\nthe General Assembly will be highly successful.\r\nMay I also convey the appreciation of my delegation\r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas Do Amaral of\r\nPortugal, for the admirable manner and great sense of\r\ncommitment with which he conducted the affairs of the\r\nfiftieth session of the Assembly. Nigeria also commends\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the energy, sense of\r\npurpose and direction which he has brought to bear on the\r\noffice of the Secretary-General in the meritorious service\r\nof our Organization.\r\nWhen we met last year to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we observed that a\r\nnumber of developments on the political and economic\r\nscene had affected relations between States and modified\r\nthe configuration of power at the global level. We\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nrecognized that the United Nations continues to be a viable\r\ninstrument for the conduct of relations amongst States. We\r\nrededicated ourselves to the principles and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, including, in particular, the\r\npromotion of social and economic development and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In this\r\nendeavour, the United Nations has a central role to play.\r\nMember States, in line with their obligations under the\r\nCharter, have a duty to assist the United Nations in carrying\r\nout this responsibility. This requires the political\r\ncommitment of all Member States and in particular of those\r\nupon which the Charter confers special status.\r\nSome of the developments which have occurred on the\r\ninternational scene include the globalization of the world\r\neconomy, the upsurge in market economies, the rise in\r\neconomic growth in a number of countries and the growing\r\ntrend towards political pluralism and democratization.\r\nHowever, new forms of conflict, new nationalisms,\r\nterrorism, an increasing incidence of poverty and global\r\nsocial decline have cast a sombre shadow on international\r\npeace and security, as well as on economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. The growing incidents of conflict, whether in\r\nEurope, in Africa or in the Middle East, and the slow pace\r\nof their resolution, are helping to exacerbate international\r\ntension and undermine confidence among States. The\r\nUnited Nations has a duty in this regard to redefine its role\r\nand sharpen its peacemaking and peacekeeping tools in\r\norder to effectively address them.\r\nPeace is indivisible. The burden of peace, therefore,\r\nshould be shared by all in a mode of global responsibility\r\nand partnership. Let me add also that the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security is not an exclusive\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations. Regional and\r\nsubregional arrangements have important roles to play and\r\nhave demonstrated their commitment.\r\nAlthough many regions of the world are now\r\nwitnessing one form of conflict or another, with varying\r\ndegrees of implications for the United Nations system, no\r\nregion perhaps is more afflicted by this menace than Africa,\r\nboth in the number of conflicts currently raging and in their\r\nunimaginable negative effects on the people. The individual\r\nand collective efforts of African States to achieve socio-\r\npolitical transformation have been threatened by these\r\nconflicts. In spite of this, the States of Africa have\r\ncontinued to make concerted efforts at regional and\r\nsubregional levels to address this situation. The unique role\r\nbeing played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and\r\nResolution is important and should be supported by the\r\ninternational community. Nigeria welcomes the\r\ncooperation between the OAU and other regional\r\norganizations and the United Nations in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacemaking.\r\nIn our own subregion, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) undertook an\r\nunprecedented initiative in crisis management by\r\nestablishing a peacekeeping force, the ECOWAS\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG), in Liberia six years ago.\r\nIn spite of the difficulties we have encountered in the\r\nprocess, we remain committed in our endeavour to help\r\nthe Liberian process reach its logical conclusion. In this\r\nregard, Nigeria shares the view of many observers who\r\nhave described the revised Abuja peace agreement of\r\nAugust 1996 as providing the best legal framework for\r\nthe resolution of the Liberian crisis. I am pleased to\r\nreport that the implementation of the Agreement revised\r\nat Abuja last August is now on course. A new Council of\r\nState, headed by Mrs. Ruth Perry, has been installed.\r\nSince her installation, Mrs. Perry has enjoyed the\r\nconsiderable confidence of the other members of the\r\nLiberian National Transitional Government and indeed of\r\nmost Liberians. I take this opportunity to appeal to all\r\nLiberians to extend cooperation to the new leadership in\r\nthe interest of peace in their country. Let me assure the\r\nAssembly that it is the determination of my Head of\r\nState, General Sani Abacha, Chairman of ECOWAS —\r\nin collaboration with other leaders in our region and with\r\nthe support of the international community as a whole —\r\nto ensure the resolution of the Liberian crisis.\r\nIt is our expectation that the Liberians themselves\r\nwill assume their destiny in favour of peace, national\r\nreconciliation and national reconstruction. We therefore\r\nrenew our appeal to the international community to\r\nprovide much-needed financial, material and logistic\r\nsupport to enable ECOMOG and the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to effectively\r\ndischarge their respective mandates. Meanwhile, we\r\nacknowledge with appreciation the renewed cooperation\r\nand assistance with the ECOWAS effort of some of the\r\nmembers of the international community.\r\nOf great importance to the search for peace in the\r\nvarious troubled spots of the world is the urgent need to\r\ncontrol the instruments of war. It is a matter of deep\r\nregret that the end of the cold war has not ushered in in\r\nits wake any appreciable reduction in the global arms\r\nbuild-up. As the arms build-up and the proliferation of\r\nconflicts are mutually reinforcing, there is an urgent need\r\nfor the international community to contain the trend. The\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nthreat posed by existing stockpiles of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and conventional armaments is yet to be\r\nremoved.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT),\r\na priority item on the disarmament agenda of the United\r\nNations, has been adopted. In spite of the imperfections of\r\nthis Treaty, the Nigerian Government was able to support\r\nit and will be signing it in due course. Its adoption, which\r\nputs an end to the further qualitative improvement of\r\nnuclear weapons and arsenals, represents a significant first\r\nstep towards the goal of nuclear disarmament. It is our\r\nexpectation that the Conference on Disarmament, the single\r\nmultilateral negotiating body on disarmament, will now take\r\nthe next logical step to negotiate such disarmament within\r\na time-bound framework. The nuclear-weapon States have\r\na clear responsibility and duty to cooperate with the\r\nConference on Disarmament to negotiate such a treaty.\r\nThe adoption of the Treaty of Pelindaba creating a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa has been an important\r\ncontribution to confidence building in Africa, in addition to\r\nbeing a collateral disarmament measure. In view of the\r\noverwhelming support enjoyed by the Treaty beyond the\r\nAfrican continent, it is recommended that other regions\r\nundertake similar efforts by establishing nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones or zones of peace. While it is commendable to\r\nobserve that the majority of nuclear-weapon States have\r\nsince signed the protocol to the Treaty, we take this\r\nopportunity to urge other States that have not yet done so\r\nto do so, in order that the full objectives of the Treaty can\r\nbe achieved.\r\nPeace and development are mutually reinforcing. A\r\njust and enduring peace can only be founded on the general\r\nwelfare and socio-economic progress of all peoples and all\r\nnations. It is indeed disconcerting to note that while the\r\ncountries of the North are becoming more affluent, the\r\ncountries of the South, which contain the majority of the\r\nworld’s population, are getting more impoverished. We\r\nmust collectively recognize and accept the fact that the\r\ndeepening crisis of development faced by developing\r\ncountries can only undermine the new world order which\r\nwe seek to create.\r\nAfrica, in particular, has continued to experience the\r\ncrippling impacts of external debt, deteriorating terms of\r\ntrade, increasing barriers to trade, declining investment and\r\nfinancial inflows, and capital flight. African countries\r\nrecognize that the primary responsibility for finding a\r\nsolution to the economic difficulties facing the continent\r\nlies with themselves. Hence they have sought to put in\r\nplace sound macro-economic policies and adopted very\r\npainful programmes of economic reform. However, their\r\nbest endeavours have continued to be constrained by the\r\nprevailing unfavourable international economic climate.\r\nWe believe that development cooperation should engender\r\ngenuine interdependence, mutual interest and benefits in\r\nthe context of global partnership, rather than the old mode\r\nof a donor-recipient relationship.\r\nWe must recognize the central role of the United\r\nNations in engendering the process of global\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, my delegation calls for faster\r\nprogress in the ongoing work on the Secretary-General’s\r\nAgenda for Development. In the same spirit, we of the\r\nAfrican continent urge the international community to\r\ndeliver on its promises under the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-\r\nNADAF). We have just taken part in the mid-term review\r\nof its implementation. We recognize that UN-NADAF has\r\nhad a poor record of implementation. None the less, the\r\nUnited Nations system and the international community\r\nat large must deliver on their various commitments.\r\nNigeria considers as complementary the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s United Nations System-wide Special Initiative\r\nfor Africa, particularly as it envisages collaboration and\r\ncoordination of efforts between the international\r\ncommunity, the Bretton Woods financial institutions and\r\nthe United Nations development agencies on the issue of\r\ndevelopment. In recognition of its role as the centre for\r\nthe harmonization of the actions of nations, the United\r\nNations successful hosting of major global conferences on\r\ndevelopment — from New York in 1990 through Rio in\r\n1992, Vienna in 1993, Cairo in 1994, Copenhagen and\r\nBeijing in 1995, to Istanbul in 1996 — deserves our\r\nspecial commendation. The faithful implementation of the\r\ndecisions and programmes of action of these conferences\r\nwould assist in bridging the yawning gap between the\r\ndeveloping and the developed economies and constitute a\r\nsubstantive benefit to development. Accordingly, we\r\nendorse and will continue to give our unqualified support\r\nto the hosting of a special session of the General\r\nAssembly in 1997 to review the implementation of\r\nAgenda 21.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to recall that contemporary\r\ninternational relations were founded on the basis of\r\nrespect for the principles of sovereign equality of States,\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States and\r\npeaceful co-existence. It is therefore a matter of great\r\nconcern that these hallowed principles are increasingly\r\nbeing eroded by some powerful States. The United\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nNations should serve as the bulwark against the imposition\r\nof the will of the strong over that of the weak.\r\nToday all countries are engaged in a universal quest\r\nfor human dignity. It is no longer sufficient for us to be\r\ncontent that our nations have been liberated from\r\noppression and foreign domination. It is now universally\r\nacknowledged that the full meaning of national sovereignty\r\ncannot be realized unless the individual citizen is free to\r\nexercise his true conscience. The rise of this new\r\ninternational conscience is a legitimate extension of the\r\nearlier emergence of the new international morality which\r\nthrew colonialism into disarray.\r\nThere ought to be no conflict between national\r\nsovereignty and the fundamental rights of the individual.\r\nWe welcome the growing international concern with human\r\nrights, but unless we are careful to strictly define the\r\nparameters of what actions justly constitute human rights\r\nand what are excesses threatening the security of the State\r\nas well as the safety and well-being of the citizens, we\r\ncould unwittingly be doing a disservice to the essence of\r\nhuman freedom and dignity. We must therefore guard\r\nagainst the use of human rights as a pretext for advancing\r\nthe individual or collective interests of one section of the\r\ninternational community against those of the other.\r\nIn today’s world, the collation, delivery and\r\nmanagement of information has become an essential\r\ncomponent of development. Countries which are better\r\nendowed technologically have tended to use that\r\nendowment to the disadvantage of the less endowed. There\r\nis a need therefore to establish a New World Information\r\nOrder, which respects the mutual sensitivities of States and\r\nprotects the values of their differing cultures.\r\nMost developing countries lack the resources and\r\ntechnological capacity for the requisite information delivery.\r\nThis, in no small measure, constrains their ability to project\r\nnews of events in their society promptly and effectively,\r\navoiding the tendentious reporting of the media in the\r\ndeveloped countries. Nigeria’s desire to be friends with all\r\nnations, our commitment to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and our abiding faith in the principles\r\nenshrined in the charters of the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and our subregional\r\norganization, ECOWAS, are demonstrable and beyond\r\nquestion. It was therefore a matter of surprise to the\r\nNigerian Government that this Assembly, in December\r\n1995, adopted resolution 50/199 of 22 December 1995 on\r\nthe human-rights situation in our country. We believe that\r\nthis action was based largely on media reporting and\r\nwithout any investigation of the facts of the matter. In\r\nspite of the fact that the Nigerian Government was not\r\nhappy with that action, we subsequently took the initiative\r\nto invite the Secretary-General to send a fact-finding\r\nmission to Nigeria to ascertain the realities on the ground.\r\nThat mission visited the country from 28 March to 13\r\nApril 1996, and conducted its work unfettered. While the\r\nmission’s report identified areas of progress in our\r\ndomestic situation, it also made constructive\r\nrecommendations. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress the appreciation of the Government and the\r\npeople of Nigeria to those Governments which took a\r\nprincipled position of not supporting the resolution against\r\nus. We note with satisfaction that since the United\r\nNations visit, a growing number of countries have\r\nreconsidered their position on the matter in favour of\r\nNigeria. We therefore urge the Assembly to take\r\ncognizance of these positive developments.\r\nThe present Administration in my country has\r\ncontinued to make steady progress in the implementation\r\nof its programme of transition to democratic rule. The\r\nfundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its\r\nprevious efforts at building a viable democracy are being\r\nprogressively addressed, taking into account the objective\r\nrealities of our national situation, so as to ensure an\r\norderly transition and the establishment of durable\r\ndemocratic structures of governance at all levels in our\r\ncountry. We are encouraged by the successful outcome of\r\nthe elections which were conducted at the local\r\ngovernment level in March this year. The impressive\r\nturnout of voters nationwide and the general atmosphere\r\nof tranquillity prevailing in our country have elicited\r\ngoodwill and support from within and outside the country.\r\nPolitical parties have now been registered and full\r\npolitical activities have resumed nation-wide. Our\r\ntransition to civil rule is now fully on an irreversible\r\ncourse.\r\nIn our resolve to ensure that the evolving democratic\r\ninstitutions take root in a fertile economic environment,\r\nthe Nigerian Government has undertaken economic\r\nreforms aimed at promoting rapid growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The overall macroeconomic performance of\r\nthe economy has improved with the implementation of\r\ndeflationary fiscal and monetary measures. Efforts are\r\nongoing to establish a conducive environment for the\r\npromotion of investment, both domestic and foreign.\r\nAdditionally, in recognition of the vital role of finance in\r\nthe attainment of greater economic efficiency, a wholesale\r\noverhaul of the banking and financial services sector has\r\nbeen undertaken to sanitize this important sector of the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nnational economy. It is also worthy of mention that\r\nnecessary instruments have been put in place in order to\r\nintensify economic deregulation and create a conducive\r\nenvironment for domestic and foreign investment.\r\nIn the year 2010, Nigeria will be 50 years old as an\r\nindependent and sovereign nation. It is envisaged that by\r\nthat date, Nigeria will have achieved economic prosperity,\r\npolitical stability and social harmony. In order to realize\r\nthis objective, our Government announced, a few weeks\r\nago, a new socio-economic campaign, “Vision 2010”, to\r\nprovide insights into and articulate the goals and objectives\r\nof our national economy in a macroeconomic format. It is\r\nalso intended to focus on the contribution of the private\r\nsector as the engine of growth of our economy. We urge\r\nthe international community to give this programme the\r\nnecessary support and encouragement.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to respond fully to the\r\npurpose for which it was established, there is need to\r\nstrengthen the Organization and to reform its principal\r\norgans. Such reform must be system-wide and must be\r\nundertaken not for its own sake but to achieve efficiency\r\nand effectiveness. It should aim to enhance rather than\r\nweaken the capacity of the United Nations to respond\r\neffectively to the legitimate aspirations of all its Members.\r\nA vibrant and responsible United Nations requires an\r\nassured financial base. The failure or unwillingness of\r\nMember States to pay their assessed contributions as and\r\nwhen due is a dereliction of Charter obligations and a threat\r\nto the survival of the United Nations. For our part, Nigeria\r\nhas continued to pay in full and without conditions our\r\nassessed contributions to the regular budget including, in\r\nparticular, for the year 1996. We therefore call on all\r\nMember States that have yet to do so to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions promptly, in full and without conditions.\r\nFor several decades, the Middle East question has\r\nengaged the attention of the international community.\r\nNigeria has been concerned with the various wars and acts\r\nof terrorism which have brought incalculable loss of life\r\nand property to that region. There can be no question but\r\nthat we will continue to support the just struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people for their inalienable right to a homeland.\r\nThere is an increasing awareness, even among the countries\r\nof the region, that the right of Israel to live within safe and\r\nsecure borders can no longer be denied. We call on all\r\nparties to intensify their efforts to ensure that the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East remains on course.\r\nFor some time now, the world has been faced with\r\na new upsurge in terrorist incidents. Nigeria condemns\r\nunreservedly all acts of terrorism in all its manifestations,\r\nas terrorism cannot be a substitute for dialogue and\r\npeaceful negotiations in resolving conflicts and\r\nmisunderstandings between nations. We call on the\r\nGeneral Assembly to take additional steps to eradicate the\r\nscourge of this menace, which also constitutes a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAs the principal organ of the United Nations, the\r\nSecurity Council is in dire need of reform. Its\r\ncomposition must reflect the principle of equity, balance\r\nand equitable geographical distribution. It must seek to\r\ncorrect the current anomaly of the non-representation of\r\nAfrica in the permanent membership category.\r\nWe should, however, be mindful that reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly in a period of transition, is an\r\nonerous undertaking. My delegation recognizes the vital\r\nrole of the office of the Secretary-General in overseeing\r\nthis reform process. In spite of the difficulties the United\r\nNations is passing through and the fluidity of the\r\ninternational situation, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali has shown uncommon and unrelenting\r\ncommitment to meeting the challenges of his office. He\r\ndeserves our gratitude and continued support. We\r\ntherefore wish to see him complete the laudable changes\r\nhe has initiated, some of which are already yielding\r\nuseful results. In this connection we reiterate and support\r\nfully the collective African position that Africa should be\r\ngiven the opportunity to serve two terms in the office of\r\nSecretary-General. For that purpose, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali is the only candidate recommended by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. Like his predecessors,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali should be given a second term\r\nto serve our Organization. It is the only credible thing to\r\ndo. This is a matter of principle in our country.\r\nMy delegation recognizes the enormous tasks facing\r\nthe Organization as it seeks to concretely address the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, and we wish to\r\nreaffirm Nigeria’s commitment to continue to contribute\r\neffectively to the realization of the Organization’s twin\r\nobjectives of global peace and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Zaire,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Marie Kititwa.\r\nMr. Kititwa (Zaire) (interpretation from French):\r\nDuring the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nUnited Nations, States renewed our faith in the ideals of the\r\nCharter of this Organization. This means that past\r\nexperience has given us a new vision of the world, a keen\r\nawareness of the interdependence of nations, all of which\r\nseek to live in a work committed to peace, freedom and\r\njustice.\r\nIt is with this conviction that my delegation extends to\r\nMr. Razali Ismail the warmest congratulations of the\r\nGovernment of Zaire on his election as President of the\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. We would also\r\nlike to congratulate his fellow Assembly officers. And we\r\nalso congratulate Mr. Razali’s predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral. The competence and\r\nintelligence he showed as he guided the work of the fiftieth\r\nsession earned him the Assembly’s appreciation.\r\nWe would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to\r\nthe Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to\r\nthe members of the Secretariat, for their untiring efforts to\r\nensure the proper functioning of our Organization and for\r\ntheir clear-sightedness and courage. Zaire also takes this\r\nopportunity to express its support for Mr. Boutros-Ghali as\r\nhe stands for a second term as Secretary-General. This must\r\nbe our position. His predecessors from other continents had\r\nthis opportunity; Africa cannot accept otherwise.\r\nDuring this half century, our free nations have won the\r\ngreatest victories in the fields of national liberation and\r\npolitical independence. However, as we come to the end of\r\nthe twentieth century, we still face major challenges in the\r\neconomic, cultural and social fields, as well as in the area\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nPeace, freedom and stability together constitute an\r\nindispensable prerequisite for development. No part of our\r\nEarth, no country in the world, can be really secure while\r\nthere are still outstanding hotbeds of tension. And, today,\r\nsuch hotbeds are on the increase, in Africa, in Asia and in\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe.\r\nThe situations in Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, Liberia,\r\nYugoslavia, Afghanistan and the Middle East are all causes\r\nfor the concern weighing on international peace and\r\nsecurity. The United Nations, which is already seized of\r\nthese issues, should continue its efforts with the\r\nencouragement of every one of us.\r\nIn Angola, a neighbouring country to Zaire, my\r\ndelegation can see positive developments in the domestic\r\nsituation. The integration of União Nacional para a\r\nIndependência Total de Angola (UNITA) forces into the\r\nAngolan National Army should be promoted and\r\nencouraged for the good of the entire population of\r\nAngola.\r\nFor more than two years, Zaire has lived with the\r\ntragedies of Burundi and Rwanda, which have lead to a\r\nmassive influx of refugees from these two countries onto\r\nits territory. This grave situation, for which my country is\r\nnot responsible, has caused and continues to cause us\r\nconsiderable human, material, environmental and other\r\nforms of damage. In this respect, the international\r\ncommunity has been inexplicably reticent in its actions,\r\nas if Zaire should shoulder this burden alone and\r\nindefinitely. Zaire is indeed constantly being denigrated\r\neven to the extent that it is often falsely accused of\r\nsupporting armed activity within Rwanda and Burundi. A\r\nmemorandum from the Government of the Republic of\r\nZaire on the lack of security in northern and southern\r\nKivu has already been submitted to the Secretary-General.\r\nA few days ago, the Zairian towns of Bukavu, Uvira and\r\nsurrounding districts were shelled by armed elements\r\nfrom Rwanda. The Assembly has heard Rwanda’s\r\npernicious and false representation of the facts. Inter-\r\nethnic massacres occurred in Rwanda in 1959, 1962 and\r\n1972, not to mention 1994. This genocide in Rwanda was\r\ndesigned, developed and executed in detail and with\r\ndelight by Rwandans against Rwandans, and by that I\r\nmean by past and present leaders in power in Kigali.\r\nMembers can now understand why Rwanda, nursing its\r\nplanned aggression against my country, has refused to\r\nsign the non-aggression pact patiently negotiated by all\r\nthe States of Central Africa, including Rwanda.\r\nFrom this rostrum, my delegation solemnly declares\r\nthe following: First, Zaire does not accept and will never\r\nagain accept to act as anyone’s scapegoat. Secondly, Zaire\r\nwill do all it can to defend the security of its population\r\nand its borders, and will call on its people and its friends\r\nin its defence. Thirdly, Zaire is always prepared to\r\ncooperate with the neighbouring Governments and\r\npeoples of Rwanda and Burundi to ensure the voluntary\r\nand dignified return of refugees to their respective\r\ncountries. Failing this, following the example of certain\r\nEuropean Governments with respect to refugees and\r\npeople without documentation, Zaire will have no choice\r\nbut to begin the enforced and unconditional return of such\r\npeople to their countries of origin.\r\nFourthly, as President Mobutu stated last year in this\r\nforum, Zaire will never accept the de facto transformation\r\nof a part of its territory into a “Hutuland”, whether\r\nthrough a challenge to its territorial integrity or through\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nthe establishment of refugee settlements on its territory.\r\nAnyone considering that can forget it.\r\nFifthly, given the sacrifices endured by its people,\r\nZaire calls on the international community to implement\r\nfully the agreements that have been signed, and General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/24 of 2 December 1994 on special\r\nassistance to countries hosting refugees. Finally, Zaire\r\nreaffirms the position it stated at the Copenhagen World\r\nSummit for Social Development regarding the holding of a\r\nworld conference on refugees and displaced persons to find\r\na comprehensive and lasting solution to the refugee\r\nquestion, which has disastrous consequences for\r\ndevelopment, human relations and human rights.\r\nThe political, economic and social situation in Zaire\r\nhas deteriorated over six long years of transition. Despite\r\nthis difficult situation, Zaire has made it a point of honour\r\nto pursue its democratic process, committing itself to\r\nreestablishing the authority of the State, rebuilding the basic\r\ninfrastructure, improving the country’s economic, financial\r\nand monetary situation, ensuring the security of persons and\r\nproperty and observing human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms.\r\nTo date, Zaire’s main task has been to organize free,\r\ndemocratic and transparent elections. This is why it has set\r\nup a National Electoral Commission which is now ready to\r\nget down to work, as observed by the delegation recently\r\nsent to Zaire by the Secretary-General. Furthermore, the\r\ndraft electoral law and the bill on the organization of a\r\nconstitutional referendum are also currently under\r\ndiscussion by the Parliament of Transition. Zaire wishes to\r\nreaffirm before the entire world that the democratization of\r\nits political system is irreversible, regardless of the\r\ndifficulties facing our country. For these reasons, the\r\nGovernment of Zaire calls on the international community\r\nto give it effective support in the establishment of these\r\nnew democratic institutions by June 1997 at the latest.\r\nDemocracy can only develop and last in a country that\r\nenjoys economic development that allows for the protection\r\nand promotion of human rights. Some human rights were\r\nbeing promoted in Zaire long before the democratization\r\nprocess. Thus, for example, despite the many social and\r\ncultural constraints, Zairian men and women enjoy political\r\nand vocational equality, including in terms of remuneration.\r\nThe noble mission of the United Nations Commission\r\non Human Rights certainly merits our encouragement. Zaire\r\nhas nothing to hide, and has thus accepted and accredited\r\nthe Secretary-General’s human rights representative, whose\r\noffice is in our capital, Kinshasa. Nonetheless, Zaire\r\ndeplores and vigorously condemns the malicious use of\r\nthe human rights issue for political ends, as can be seen\r\nin the unfounded and unwarranted accusations levelled\r\nagainst it at each annual evaluation session of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights in Geneva.\r\nPreventive diplomacy should be the very basis of\r\npeace-keeping operations. However, preventive diplomacy\r\nwould be meaningless if the international community\r\nwere not to grant it a standing, mobile military sector that\r\ncould be deployed wherever international peace and\r\nsecurity were to come under threat. Thus, in the\r\nframework of the United Nations Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, the\r\ncountries of this subregion, with the exception of Rwanda,\r\nsigned the non-aggression pact at the latest Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) summit in Yaoundé.\r\nIn this first year of the second half-century of the\r\nUnited Nations, safeguarding peace and cohesion among\r\npeoples are issues of vital importance to all of us. Zaire\r\nconsiders the adoption of the resolution recommending\r\nsignature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nat the fiftieth session of the General Assembly to be an\r\nimportant step towards comprehensive nuclear\r\ndisarmament. We do, of course, recognize that this is not\r\na perfect Treaty. It lacks the firm commitment of nuclear-\r\nweapon States to renounce the use and threat of use of\r\nsuch weapons in their relations with other States. It also\r\nlacks a precise timetable for complete destruction of\r\nexisting weapons. It does not mention the banning of\r\nnuclear tests in laboratories, which is the most\r\nsophisticated modern way of developing such weapons.\r\nDespite these imperfections, Zaire joined those\r\ndelegations that sponsored the resolution, and it voted in\r\nfavour of the text proposed. I wish to announce officially\r\nthat Zaire will sign this text tomorrow, 4 October.\r\nFrom this rostrum we appeal to the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to put aside their selfish interests and to commit\r\nthemselves firmly to the new path set out by the Treaty,\r\nso that the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons can\r\nbecome a living reality and so that nuclear weapons will\r\nno longer threaten future generations, as they have done\r\nsince the end of the Second World War.\r\nWe cannot be at peace with ourselves if we fail to\r\ntake firm action for conventional disarmament as well.\r\nI come from a region where the merchants of death\r\nhave dumped tons and tons of conventional weapons that\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nkill people daily. We urge countries that manufacture and\r\nsell these instruments of death to stop taking satisfaction in\r\nthe positive balance sheets of their international trade,\r\nwhich includes arms sales. This is a shame for all mankind.\r\nTo those who would give lessons of morality and ethics, we\r\nwould insist that they look at the way they live and stop\r\nsowing death and suffering. Life and happiness are the most\r\nfundamental of human rights.\r\nIn addition to disarmament, worldwide elimination of\r\npoverty is fundamental to the strengthening of peace and\r\nthe realization of comprehensive, sustainable development.\r\nAt the dawn of the third millennium, it is deplorable to note\r\nthat more than a billion people today live under conditions\r\nof unacceptable poverty and are outside the mainstream of\r\neconomic and social progress because of imbalances in the\r\ninternational economy.\r\nMy delegation hopes that, to remedy this situation, the\r\nNorth-South dialogue will be guided more by the\r\nimperatives and interests of mutual advantage and benefit,\r\nas well as by genuine interdependence. Solidarity demands\r\nfairer prices for commodities, access to the markets of\r\ndeveloped countries, easing the debt burden and increased\r\nofficial development assistance so as to ensure sustained\r\ngrowth and sustainable development.\r\nLast year we commemorated our Organization’s\r\nfiftieth anniversary. That occasion was an opportunity for\r\nus to focus on the possibilities for an appropriate reform of\r\nthis Organization, which is unique in its mission and its\r\nimpact. I would like to offer my country’s reflections on\r\nthis subject.\r\nWe are now living in a period of extraordinary\r\ncontrasts. Despite the historic successes of our Organization\r\n— including independence for many countries, the peace\r\nprocess under way in the Middle East, the end of the South\r\nAfrican saga and the perceptible tendency of the United\r\nNations towards universality — we must observe with some\r\nbitterness that areas of tension have flared up worldwide,\r\nsparking anarchy, despair, poverty and death.\r\nFor this reason, Zaire believes that the Security\r\nCouncil, which is the United Nations body that has\r\nforemost responsibility for maintaining international peace\r\nand security, and which by its present membership is no\r\nlonger representative, should be expanded and its\r\nfunctioning improved. In this exercise, the main concern\r\nshould be to correct the clear imbalance in that body.\r\nExpansion of the Council should take into account the will\r\nof many countries to become members and the importance\r\nof safeguarding its effectiveness. It should avoid making\r\nit a body dependent on the General Assembly. For that\r\nreason, we think that equitable geographic representation\r\nwould appropriately remedy the glaring imbalance in the\r\ncurrent representation of the Security Council. We\r\nencourage the international community to give deep\r\nthought to this question and not to forget that one\r\ncontinent — Africa — is at the greatest disadvantage with\r\nthe current composition of the Council.\r\nWe refuse to be dragged into the dispute over the\r\nveto power of permanent members. We are against the\r\nemergence of a category of permanent second-class\r\nmembers in the Security Council.\r\nThere is a need to look for ways to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council. It is inconceivable\r\nthat a State that is concerned in a question being\r\ndiscussed in the Council can participate only in a formal\r\nmeeting — if there is one — to hear the decision made.\r\nIf the State were officially involved in the informal\r\nconsultations on that issue, its direct contribution to the\r\nmembers of the Council could enable them to adopt\r\ndecisions that would be well thought out and realistic\r\nrather than being imposed.\r\nWe must have the courage to put an end to the anti-\r\ndemocratic character of this important United Nations\r\nbody. All the parties involved should be given the\r\nopportunity to defend themselves before the members of\r\nthe Council. This is a basic rule of the administration of\r\njustice.\r\nWe take note of the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we encourage it to pursue its\r\nconsideration of this matter.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdulaziz Kamilov.\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Let me express my appreciation for the honour\r\nof addressing the Assembly. On behalf of the Government\r\nand people of the Republic of Uzbekistan, I offer my\r\nsincerest congratulations to Ambassador Razali Ismail of\r\nMalaysia on his election as President of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that his\r\npresidency will enable us successfully to solve many of\r\nthe urgent issues on the international agenda. I also take\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nthis opportunity to extend our appreciation and gratitude to\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, President of the historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly, for his valuable\r\nguidance and personal involvement in the resolution of\r\nissues the world was facing during that period.\r\nWe consider the safeguarding of peace and stability in\r\nCentral Asia and the sustainable development of the region\r\nas the most important goal of our cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. In this context,\r\nI would like to outline a number of problems and to make\r\nseveral proposals.\r\nFirst, regarding regional security, we are of the view\r\nthat we need to move through regionalism towards the\r\nglobal: global peace can be achieved through stability in the\r\nvarious regions of the world. Regional conflicts are\r\nincreasingly the direct source of such dangerous challenges\r\nand threats as terrorism and violence, the illicit arms trade\r\nand drugs trafficking. That is why the main focus of\r\nUzbekistan’s initiatives aimed at ensuring security in the\r\nCentral Asian region is finding ways to settle the conflict\r\nin Afghanistan and to stabilize the situation in Tajikistan.\r\nOne of the most important elements of these initiatives\r\nis an embargo on arms deliveries to Afghanistan. We\r\nwelcome the start of a discussion of this problem in the\r\nSecurity Council and support proposals for a comprehensive\r\napproach and for the convening of an international\r\nconference — where, in our view, the main role should be\r\nplayed by the United Nations. Halting arms deliveries to\r\nAfghanistan is an indispensable condition for any peace\r\nprocess. An embargo does not mean just any sanctions\r\nagainst Afghanistan; it has to be directed towards those who\r\ncontinue to supply weapons to the area of conflict. The\r\ninability of Afghanistan’s forces to control its borders\r\nrequires efforts on the part of the international community\r\nto ensure that arms deliveries are ended.\r\nI would like to underline particularly that the Republic\r\nof Uzbekistan, more than any other nation in the world,\r\nseeks to return to age-old traditional relations of friendship,\r\ncooperation and mutual trust with neighbouring\r\nAfghanistan. This is the only aim guiding us in our\r\ninitiatives to promote peace in the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan. We want Afghanistan to be a stable,\r\nindivisible State, open to the outside world for the sake of\r\nprogress and prosperity. I take this opportunity to appeal\r\nonce again to the Secretary-General, and to the Presidents\r\nof the Security Council and the General Assembly to do\r\ntheir utmost to resolve the Afghan conflict, which poses a\r\nserious threat not only to regional security but also to for\r\nglobal security.\r\nWe continue to believe that Central Asia has its own\r\ncharacteristics; the positive or negative development of\r\nevents there can be a catalyst for positive changes or a\r\ndestructive factor affecting the situation far beyond the\r\nregion.\r\nSecondly, we must enter the twenty-first century\r\nwith a new vision of questions of peace and security in a\r\nrapidly changing world. The promotion of world peace is\r\naccompanied today by intensive debates and disputes on\r\nthe expansion of the membership of various international\r\nbodies and on models for comprehensive world security\r\nin the twenty-first century.\r\nWhile welcoming these aspirations, we must note\r\nthat each sovereign country in this multi-polar world has\r\nthe right to decide for itself, in accordance with its\r\nnational interests, and with its regional identity taken into\r\nconsideration, whether or not to enter a given union,\r\nirrespective of the position of more powerful countries.\r\nThere is no place for domination or monopoly on the part\r\nof other, more powerful, countries in resolving this\r\nproblem.\r\nThirdly, as regards our position in relation to the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), we consider\r\nthat the CIS countries can successfully cooperate within\r\nthe framework of the Commonwealth on a multilateral\r\nand bilateral basis. At the same time, we believe that the\r\nCIS cannot be treated as a unit under international law. It\r\nis unacceptable to let the CIS be transformed into a\r\npolitical or indeed a military-political bloc. Otherwise, the\r\nworld community will inevitably slide back down into\r\nglobal antagonisms and confrontation. For Uzbekistan,\r\nthis is fundamentally unacceptable.\r\nFourthly, Uzbekistan continues to support the\r\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons and views as\r\nhistoric the decision to conclude the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations, and the beginning of the signature\r\nprocess of the Treaty. We consider this event to be a\r\nmost important stage in liberating humanity from the\r\nthreat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nFor our part, the relevant work is being carried out\r\nto establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia within the\r\ninternational non-proliferation system. We believe that the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\ninitiative of the President of Uzbekistan will soon find more\r\ndetailed interest in the Security Council.\r\nFifthly, I would like once again to draw the attention\r\nof Member States to ecological problems, whose\r\ndimensions go beyond State borders. I would especially like\r\nto say a word about the problem of the Aral Sea. There\r\nhave already been a great number of scientific studies and\r\ninternational conferences, including several on the\r\nsustainable development of the Aral Sea countries.\r\nHowever, to our great disappointment, we do not see any\r\nmovement from statements to practical deeds. I would like\r\nto note that Uzbekistan supports and considers as timely\r\nGreat Britain’s proposal on the adoption of a special\r\ndeclaration condemning terrorism in all its forms.\r\nFor a more effective functioning of United Nations\r\nmachinery in all areas of activity, we consider it necessary\r\nto reform a number of United Nations organs, including the\r\nSecurity Council. This is in line with today’s realities. The\r\ngeo-strategic balance of power raises the question of the\r\nexpansion of the number of permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council. We are convinced that such States as\r\nGermany and Japan today are fully equipped to be\r\npermanent members of the Security Council.\r\nUzbekistan stands for the constructive reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. In this context, together with other States,\r\nincluding Italy, whose proposals deserve serious attention,\r\nwe express our sincere desire to ensure that the United\r\nNations is a reliable instrument for maintaining universal\r\npeace and stability.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Guinea, His Excellency Mr. Lamine\r\nKamara.\r\nMr. Kamara (Guinea) (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is with real pleasure and great interest that I stand before\r\nthe Assembly to convey the warm greetings of the people\r\nof Guinea and of its President, General Lansana Conte. I\r\njoin with the many preceding speakers in warmly\r\ncongratulating Ambassador Razali on his election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. His election is testimony to the international\r\ncommunity’s high regard for Malaysia, his country, with\r\nwhich the Republic of Guinea is honoured to have special\r\nties of friendship and cooperation. I am convinced that\r\nunder his skilful guidance our work will enjoy every\r\nsuccess. I assure him of the support and cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Guinea in this task.\r\nMy congratulations also go to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal who, with skill\r\nand clearsightedness, enabled the Assembly to address the\r\nconcerns of the international community during the\r\nfiftieth session.\r\nMy country, the Republic of Guinea, takes this\r\nopportunity to greet and stress our tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\r\ncourage, intelligence and tireless efforts have contributed\r\nsignificantly to the attainment of the Organization’s noble\r\npurposes of peace, justice and progress. This is why my\r\ndelegation reiterates its support for his candidacy for a\r\nsecond term of office, in accordance with the decision of\r\nthe most recent Summit Meeting of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, held at Yaounde from 8 to 10 July 1996.\r\nA host of challenges are now threatening to upset\r\nthe balance of the United Nations as we approach the end\r\nof the millennium. Despite encouraging results in terms\r\nof maintaining international peace and security, many\r\nconflicts incompatible with people’s aspirations of\r\neconomic and social progress persist.\r\nIn addition to the tensions and conflicts which are\r\ntearing peoples apart, of equal concern are the poverty,\r\nunemployment, malnutrition and environmental\r\ndegradation that continue to threaten the existence and\r\nfuture of many populations of the world. Today more\r\nthan ever there is an urgent need radically to restructure\r\nour common institution, the United Nations, so that it can\r\nadapt better to current changes, respond appropriately to\r\nthe expectations of our populations on the major questions\r\nwhich challenge humankind and make the outlook for the\r\nfuture one filled with hope.\r\nThe need to prevent and settle conflicts, to support\r\nthe efforts of States to ensure sustainable development, to\r\nprovide easier access to suitable housing and to guarantee\r\nsufficient food for all are now becoming elements of the\r\npromotion of human rights. The same holds true for how\r\nwe deal with the implications of the globalization of the\r\ninternational economy through reliable mechanisms.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea welcomes and strongly\r\nencourages the initiative of Japan, our great friend, to\r\ndesign and implement, with our countries, a new\r\ndevelopment strategy. In this respect, it supports the\r\norganization in 1997 in Tokyo of the second International\r\nConference on African Development in which it\r\nundertakes to play an active role from the preparatory\r\nphase to the end of its work. We are convinced that there\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nis an urgent need and obligation to support firmly a new\r\nform of world partnership involving all nations, large and\r\nsmall.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea, aware of the fresh challenges\r\nfacing developing countries on the eve of the third\r\nmillennium, has decided that its diplomacy should be based\r\non development. This role of diplomatic linchpin in the area\r\nof economic advancement will not only strengthen our\r\ncommitment to subregional and regional integration, but\r\nwill also increase significantly our participation in\r\ninternational trade.\r\nQuestions of international peace and security must\r\nremain at the forefront of our concerns. In this respect, my\r\ndelegation considers that the main role of the United\r\nNations is to continue and intensify the search for ways and\r\nmeans to increase the effectiveness of its action in the areas\r\nof the maintenance of peace and of preventive diplomacy.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which I have just\r\nsigned on behalf of the Government of Guinea. We see this\r\nas an important step towards total disarmament. If the\r\nTreaty is to attain all of its objectives, the main one being\r\nto spare humanity from chaos, it must be signed and\r\nrespected by all States of the world. To do this, we must\r\ncalmly and jointly seek to give the assurances of the\r\ninternational community to countries that hesitate to take\r\nthe decisive step towards the salvation of humanity, so that\r\nin the near future the accession of all Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations will enshrine the universality of this\r\nimportant Treaty.\r\nAlong the same lines, my delegation calls on the\r\ninternational community to implement global measures to\r\nprohibit the illegal traffic of fissile materials, the\r\ntransborder trafficking in conventional small arms and the\r\nproduction, stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nMore than 110 million mines are now scattered around the\r\nworld, ready to explode at any time, indiscriminately\r\nstriking down innocent civilian populations.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea welcomes the adoption of the\r\ntext of Protocol II to the Convention on Prohibitions or\r\nRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons\r\nWhich May be Deemed to Be excessively Injurious or to\r\nHave Indiscriminate Effects, on Mines, Booby-Traps and\r\nOther Such Devices during the Review Conference on the\r\nimplementation of that Convention.\r\nOther threats weigh heavily on international peace\r\nand security. Our Organization must react vigorously to\r\nthe threats of terrorism, organized crime and drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nApart from their many disastrous consequences,\r\nthese threats, because they are transborder threats, must\r\nbe considered as real dangers to the health, security and\r\nstability both of our populations and of our States.\r\nMy delegation, while welcoming the decisions of the\r\nGroup of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and\r\ntransnational threats, believes that a more complete use of\r\nthe potential of the United Nations as an instrument for\r\ndeveloping joint international strategies and cooperation\r\namong all States in the area of fighting crime would\r\nallow for more effective coordination of the actions of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the United Nations efforts in\r\nother areas as dangerous as terrorism: money-laundering,\r\ntrafficking in children and all related crimes. Fighting\r\nthese scourges of our time is everyone’s business.\r\nIn Africa, tangible progress has been made in the\r\narea of peace and democracy. The Republic of Guinea,\r\nhowever, remains concerned by the conflicts which\r\ncontinue to rage on the continent. In the West African\r\nsubregion, the situations in Liberia and Sierra Leone have\r\ntangibly improved, despite some obstacles, which we are\r\nstriving to overcome within the context of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and its\r\npeace force, the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG).\r\nThe conflict in Liberia has lasted for seven long\r\nyears. It has caused the death of tens of thousands of\r\npeople and has led to a mass exodus of hundreds of\r\nthousands of refugees to neighbouring States, including\r\nmy country, the Republic of Guinea, on whose territory\r\nare hundreds of thousands of refugees, to whom it offers\r\nassistance and protection while at the same time\r\nespousing total neutrality in relation to other States\r\nmembers of ECOWAS in the search for a political\r\nsolution to end this conflict.\r\nThe joint efforts of that subregional organization\r\nwith such major forums as the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and the United Nations led to the signing of\r\nthe most recent peace agreements at Abuja, Nigeria. The\r\nRepublic of Guinea, true to its policy of good-\r\nneighbourliness and neutrality, firmly supports these\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nagreements, which provide for free and transparent elections\r\nin May 1997, and will ensure their strict implementation.\r\nAn end to this conflict is of interest to the Republic of\r\nGuinea, my country, mainly because of the presence on our\r\nterritory of more than 650,000 refugees compared with a\r\npopulation of 7 million Guineans: one refugee for every 10\r\ninhabitants. This is a situation with rare precedents.\r\nSimilarly, our participation in the peace effort places a\r\nheavy burden on our economy and compromises many of\r\nour development projects.\r\nI would like to make an urgent appeal to all the parties\r\nconcerned with this conflict to implement the Abuja\r\nAgreement in full, and in a timely manner, to the benefit of\r\nstability in the subregion. The promises of assistance from\r\nfriendly countries and by the international community\r\ncould, if kept within the timetable, effectively lead the final\r\nsettlement plan to success. The initiatives under way in this\r\nregard are very encouraging. We welcome the action of the\r\nUnited States of America to assist ECOWAS peace efforts\r\nand thank the United States warmly for its latest\r\ncontribution to the financing of the activities of ECOMOG.\r\nThe deterioration of the socio-political climate in\r\nBurundi stirs fears today of a repetition of the threats\r\nexperienced in neighbouring Rwanda, a country with which\r\nit shares many social, historical and cultural similarities.\r\nThe continuation of this crisis also poses a serious threat to\r\nstability in the region and to peace. This is why the United\r\nNations, together with neighbouring countries, must be\r\nfurther involved in the search for a final solution to this\r\ncrisis. We lend our full support to the recent decision taken\r\nby the OAU and by the conference of Heads of State of the\r\nGreat Lakes region, held at Arusha, against the Government\r\nstemming from the coup d’état. We urge all the sons of\r\nBurundi and all those of good-will worldwide to support\r\nOAU efforts towards the peaceful settlement of the crises\r\nin Burundi and in Rwanda through dialogue, tolerance and\r\nreconciliation among the various communities.\r\nAs regards Western Sahara, my Government supports\r\nthe international community’s efforts for a peaceful solution\r\nto this question, in accordance with the United Nations\r\nsettlement plan.\r\nWith respect to Angola, my delegation strongly\r\nencourages the Angolan Government and União Nacional\r\npara a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to\r\npersevere along the path to peace and national\r\nreconciliation on the basis of the implementation of and\r\nrespect for the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nRegarding the situation in Somalia, we must say that\r\nleaving Somalians to their fate would be contrary to the\r\nUnited Nations ideal of solidarity. Despite the difficulties,\r\nthe United Nations must continue to be involved actively\r\nin the process of restoring peace to that country, through\r\na continuous search for mechanisms to promote national\r\nreconciliation, peace, security and stability in Somalia.\r\nOn the Middle East, my Government remains greatly\r\nconcerned by the latest developments in Jerusalem, in\r\nGaza and in the West Bank. The seriousness of these\r\nevents could jeopardize the peace process. We are\r\nconvinced that rapid approach of Palestinian autonomy in\r\nthe Gaza Strip, in Jericho and in the West Bank, and the\r\nnecessary continuation of the peace process are the\r\nresponsibility of the entire international community. This\r\nis why my delegation solemnly calls upon all the parties\r\ninvolved with the Middle East conflict, especially Israel\r\nand its Arab neighbours, to continue courageously on the\r\npath of peace, through the pursuit of negotiations, in\r\naccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions\r\nand the Peace Agreements.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea, convinced that dialogue,\r\nthe creation of a climate of mutual trust and a greater\r\nmutual understanding constitute the only path towards a\r\nlasting solution on the Korean peninsula, will continue to\r\nencourage the two Korean States to persevere in their\r\nefforts towards independent and peaceful reunification.\r\nThe signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995\r\nhas opened up fresh prospects for the restoration and\r\nconsolidation of peace in the Balkans. With the recent\r\nelections in Bosnia, developments in the situation\r\nstrengthen the aspirations to peace, stability and security\r\nof the region’s peoples. We must however remain\r\nvigilant. In this respect, my delegation welcomes and\r\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations, of the\r\nImplementation Force (IFOR) and of the international\r\ncriminal tribunal, aimed at consolidating peace and\r\nprosecuting those responsible for crimes against humanity.\r\nWe invite the international community to display firmness\r\nin dealing with this question, in order to extinguish any\r\nre-emergence of the practices of “ethnic cleansing”. The\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference must be involved\r\nmore closely in the process begun in this country.\r\nThe situation in Jammu and Kashmir continues to\r\ndeteriorate. At its various summits and ministerial\r\nconferences, the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nhas appealed to the international community to urge the\r\nprotagonists to abide by the relevant Security Council\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nresolutions and thus enable the Kashmiri people to exercise\r\nfreely its right to self-determination. We repeat this appeal,\r\nand invite them to begin a constructive dialogue.\r\nThe Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, which is chaired by\r\nthe Republic of Guinea, requests the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council to shoulder all their responsibilities by\r\nbecoming decisively involved in the search for peace in the\r\nIndian sub-continent. Security Council resolutions 47\r\n(1948), 91 (1951) and 122 (1957) on Jammu and Kashmir,\r\nwhich remain unimplemented after five decades, should not\r\nremain among the forgotten resolutions of our system. The\r\nRepublic of Guinea therefore gives its full support to efforts\r\nby the Government of Pakistan aimed at finding a peaceful\r\nsolution to the problem of Jammu and Kashmir through the\r\nopening of talks with India.\r\nMy country follows the development of the situation\r\nin Afghanistan with the greatest attention. It urges all the\r\nparties concerned to work fraternally for the restoration of\r\npeace and for national reconciliation.\r\nIn the context of its actions within the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference, of which it is a founding member\r\nand current Chairman of its Council of Ministers for\r\nForeign Affairs, the Republic of Guinea — a secular\r\ncountry with a strong Muslim majority — is dedicated to\r\npromoting understanding and tolerance among civilizations,\r\ncultures and religions and to contributing to the rise of the\r\nforces of progress, justice and democracy in Muslim\r\nregions and in the world beyond.\r\nAt a time when the world is experiencing profound\r\nchanges of unequalled complexity and scope, it is essential\r\nto promote and consolidate an international environment\r\nthat will foster peace, growth and development. It is\r\nregrettable that Africa does not play a greater role in major\r\ninternational negotiations. We must not continue to be\r\nspectators while the rest of the world carries out\r\nnegotiations which involve us directly or indirectly. We are\r\nconvinced that Africa has a role to play in this area.\r\nIn the new configuration of today’s world, a country\r\nsuch as the Republic of Guinea — through its policy of\r\npeace and because its interests do not diverge from those of\r\nother regions of the world; through the nature of its\r\nsometimes exceptional relations with the parties in latent or\r\novert conflicts in various regions; through its membership\r\nin several geo-political groups, several cultural zones and\r\nseveral continental and non-African organizations — could,\r\nwhere desirable, play a useful role in international\r\nnegotiations.\r\nThe permanence and fairness of development will be\r\nillusory so long as modalities that preserve and perpetuate\r\npresent inequalities continue to govern international\r\nrelations. Economic and social development, whose\r\ncorrelation with international peace and security is clear,\r\nrequires of States and of the international institutions that\r\nare our development partners a pragmatic and coherent\r\napproach which takes into account the specific socio-\r\neconomic needs and realities of our States.\r\nMy delegation is pleased with the efforts that have\r\nalready been made in the area of debt relief for\r\ndeveloping countries and appeals to the solidarity of the\r\ninternational community for a real increase in\r\ndevelopment assistance, whose current tendency to\r\ndecrease is a real source of concern for us in the face of\r\nour pressing development needs. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the decisions of the last summit of the Group of\r\nSeven, held at Lyon.\r\nAlthough the conclusion of the Uruguay Round\r\nopens up new prospects for the stimulation of\r\ninternational trade, it is essential to introduce new,\r\nenergetic measures to save Africa from marginalization\r\nand impoverishment. It is a human, social, political and\r\neconomic imperative for the international community and\r\nfor all the actors and partners in development, in their\r\nown specific actions, to work responsibly for a more just\r\nand equitable framework for international trade, favouring\r\na free and democratic economic partnership.\r\nWe therefore congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his praiseworthy efforts\r\nwhich have made it possible to develop the United\r\nNations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa. My\r\ncountry would like to express the hope that this will not\r\nsuffer from the same lethargy which the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery\r\nand Development suffered from. Such a failure would be\r\nhighly prejudicial and damaging to the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations. In this regard, my delegation seeks the\r\nurgent implementation of this ambitious Initiative, for it\r\nis undeniable that it is one of the best ways of giving\r\ndevelopment a chance and new hope for future\r\ngenerations.\r\nWe would also like to express our satisfaction at the\r\nconvening of the second United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Settlements and to support the important\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\nresolutions arising from that Conference promoting access\r\nto suitable housing for all.\r\nAlong these lines, my delegation would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to welcome the holding of the World Food\r\nSummit, which will take place from 13 to 17 November\r\n1996 at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations.\r\nMy Government believes that the enhancement of our\r\nOrganization’s effectiveness lies above all in the\r\nredefinition of some of its objectives, especially in adapting\r\nthe functioning of its organs to reflect better the new face\r\nof international relations. With regard to the Security\r\nCouncil, my Government fully supports the review and\r\nexpansion of its current composition on the basis of\r\nequitable geographical representation so that the southern\r\nhemisphere — which since 1945 has been the theatre of\r\nmany conflicts — can participate in its activities which are\r\nfundamental to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMy wish, therefore, is for the United Nations to carry\r\nout its restructuring. Whether with regard to revitalizing the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its organs, to expanding or\r\nstrengthening the Security Council, to rationalizing\r\nactivities and procedures, to redefining programmes and\r\nmandates or to consolidating the financial and material\r\nbases of the Organization, all Member States must work\r\nwith courage, clarity and a high sense of responsibility for\r\nthe proper implementation of these reforms in order to give\r\nthe United Nations reliable and effective institutions worthy\r\nof the vision and aspirations of our peoples.\r\nThat is why my delegation, while expressing its\r\nsatisfaction at the evident willingness and efforts of our\r\nOrganization to adapt to the world’s changes, is in favour\r\nof strengthening its potential and improving the interaction\r\namong the various organizations of the United Nations\r\nsystem and other development partners.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Guinea would like to\r\nexpress the hope that courageous and realistic decisions will\r\ncome out of the work of this session, and it remains\r\nconvinced that — apart from divergences and differences\r\nin approach in the search for ways and means to achieve\r\nsolutions to the problems facing our States — the United\r\nNations community which we constitute will continue to\r\nwork successfully for peace, security and the well-being of\r\nall, in the spirit of active solidarity, as the founding fathers\r\nof this Organization dreamed.\r\nThe Acting President: The Observer of Palestine\r\nhas asked to be allowed to reply to a statement made by\r\none of the speakers in the general debate. I shall call on\r\nhim on the basis of General Assembly resolutions 3237\r\n(XXIX) of 22 November 1974 and 43/177 of 15\r\nDecember 1988, and particularly on the basis of the\r\nruling made by the President of the General Assembly at\r\nits thirty-first session and of the precedents established in\r\nsimilar circumstances during subsequent sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): The representative of Israel, Mr. David Levy,\r\nspoke before the General Assembly this morning. In his\r\nstatement he confirmed Israel’s defiance of the\r\ninternational community and its violation of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions concerning a very important question,\r\nnamely the legal status of the Holy City of Al Quds. In\r\nspeaking of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel he repeated\r\nthe myths of thousands of years.\r\nAs a matter of fact, United Nations organs, and\r\nespecially the Security Council in many resolutions, have\r\nconfirmed that East Jerusalem is an integral part of the\r\nArab territories occupied since 1967, to which the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention of 1949 is applicable. The Security\r\nCouncil has declared null and void all legislative and\r\nadministrative measures adopted by Israel to change the\r\ncity’s legal status or demographic composition. It has\r\ncalled upon Israel to annul these measures and not to\r\nrepeat them, and for Member States not to establish\r\ndiplomatic missions in Jerusalem.\r\nAll the States of the world have agreed not to\r\nrecognize illegal Israeli measures which would name\r\nJerusalem as the capital of Israel. This applies not only to\r\noccupied East Jerusalem, but also to West Jerusalem,\r\nwhich was under Israeli control before 1967.\r\nWe should not forget that General Assembly\r\nresolution 181 (II), which Israel considers the legal basis\r\nfor its existence, decided to consider Jerusalem a separate\r\ninternational entity. In addition to this, we must remember\r\nthat both the Israeli and Palestinian sides agreed, in the\r\n1993 Declaration of Principles, which is binding on both\r\nparties, to negotiate the status of Jerusalem in the second\r\nphase of negotiations.\r\nConsequently, any Israeli measures to establish a\r\nnew fait accompli in Jerusalem or to enforce its claims\r\nviolate agreements between the two parties. First and\r\nforemost among those measures was the opening of a\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 3 October 1996\r\ntunnel under the western wall of the Holy Shrine. Prior to\r\nthat, Israel destroyed the community centre of the Burj Al-\r\nLaqlaq Association in the Old City.\r\nThis leads us to the other policies pursued by the\r\nGovernment of Israel since it assumed power. I can refer\r\nhere to the non-implementation of provisions of the\r\nAgreement that are now due to be implemented, especially\r\nwithdrawal from the city of Al-Khalil and from Area B; the\r\ncontinued blockade of Palestinian territory; the prohibition\r\nof the movement of persons and goods in violation of the\r\neconomic part of the Agreement; and the continued\r\nsettlement policy on occupied Palestinian lands, including\r\nJerusalem, which is a flagrant violation of international\r\nhumanitarian law and of agreements between the parties.\r\nWe view as positive the meetings between leaders of\r\nthe two parties, including the summit meeting which was\r\norganized by President Clinton and which ended yesterday.\r\nYet, regrettably, these meetings have not achieved the\r\nnecessary changes in Israeli policies and positions. The\r\nsituation created by these policies is extremely dangerous,\r\nbecause they have caused unbearable suffering on the part\r\nof the Palestinian people.\r\nWe must admit, before the international community,\r\nthat the Middle East peace process is facing a great danger.\r\nIt is facing a serious crisis because of Israeli policies and\r\npositions. We hope that — with the help of the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations and with\r\nthe direct contribution of the co-sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess and of the other actors in Europe — the status of\r\nthe negotiations can return to what it was before the recent\r\ncrisis. This should include the closing of the tunnel in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1073 (1996),\r\nand an end to the blockade of Palestinian towns and\r\nvillages, in which tanks are being used. We also hope to\r\nsee a serious change in the Israeli position, with a\r\ncommitment to the effective implementation of the\r\nagreements that have been entered into and with Israel\r\nrefraining from any act that would violate the agreements\r\nand render them useless.\r\nLet us work together to rescue the peace process and\r\nto agree on the basis of these agreements. We hope to reach\r\na peaceful and just solution to the Palestinian question and\r\nto achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform Members\r\nthat the General Committee will meet on Tuesday, 8\r\nOctober 1996, at 9.15 a.m. in Conference Room 3 to\r\nconsider a request for the inclusion of an additional item,\r\nentitled “Observer status for the International Seabed\r\nAuthority”, which has been circulated in document\r\nA/51/231.\r\nAnnouncement\r\nThe President: I would like to remind\r\nrepresentatives of the following dates: The 1996 United\r\nNations Pledging Conference for Development Activities\r\nwill be held in conjunction with the United Nations/Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\npledging conference for the World Food Programme.
