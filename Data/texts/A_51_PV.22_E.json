(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, President of\r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania.\r\nMr. Benjamin William Mkapa, President of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mkapa: Permit me at the outset to\r\ncongratulate you, Ambassador Razali, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your election is a fitting tribute to your\r\ndistinguished career in diplomacy, an expression of\r\nconfidence in your abilities and a reflection of the high\r\nregard in which you and your country, Malaysia, are held\r\nby the international community. You have our confidence,\r\nand I can assure you of Tanzania’s full support and\r\ncooperation as you guide the deliberations of this session.\r\nI commend also your predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral\r\nof Portugal, who very ably presided over the historic fiftieth\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nMy appreciation goes also to the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a\r\ndistinguished son of Africa, who for the past five years\r\nhas worked tirelessly to enhance the image of the\r\nOrganization as well as its ability to meet the challenges\r\nof the rapidly evolving international environment. He has\r\nprovided dedicated leadership at a particularly difficult\r\ntime in the history of the United Nations, enduring often\r\nunwarranted personal criticism even as he was operating\r\nin a situation of diminishing resources on the one hand,\r\nand escalating, often conflicting, expectations on the other\r\nhand.\r\nMy predecessor in office stood at this rostrum\r\nexactly two years ago and, in bidding farewell to the\r\nUnited Nations, spoke of the political transition then\r\nunder way in my country and of preparations for the first\r\nmulti-party elections in Tanzania in over 30 years. He\r\nunderlined his intention to bequeath to the people of\r\nTanzania a functioning democracy leveraged upon a\r\nshared national culture of political accommodation and\r\ntolerance. Today, I am proud to be here as a product of\r\nthat process of transition, to reaffirm our commitment and\r\nabiding faith in the United Nations in its endeavour to\r\npromote international peace and security as well as\r\neconomic and social development throughout the world.\r\nThe United Nations has, since its inception,\r\nexpanded its role in the international system\r\ntremendously, becoming a major player in national\r\ndevelopment and international cooperation. The various\r\nsummits that it has organized in recent years, coupled\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nwith its numerous activities covering the entire spectrum of\r\npolitical, social and economic spheres, in all corners of the\r\nworld, is testimony to the critical role of the United Nations\r\nin resolving the national and international problems facing\r\nmankind.\r\nThe United Nations has helped maintain international\r\npeace and security at very critical times. It has overseen the\r\ndelivery of peoples and nations from the shackles of\r\ncolonialism and institutionalized racism to independence.\r\nAs a result of these efforts, membership has increased\r\nalmost fourfold. The ideals of freedom and justice and\r\nhuman rights are understood by most of the world, even if\r\nthey may not always be observed. The United Nations has\r\nbuilt a common global culture of shared values, and it has\r\nalso helped in promoting development, building social and\r\neconomic infrastructures and much more.\r\nToday, the United Nations stands at a crossroads. New\r\nchallenges, not least those brought about by a rapidly\r\nchanging international environment, keep demanding its\r\nundivided attention. The challenge before us, as we stand\r\non the threshold of the new millennium, is to invigorate and\r\nreinforce this Organization, drawing upon the collective\r\nresources and knowledge of our world and acting in\r\npartnership.\r\nLikewise, the ideal we all share for participatory\r\ndemocracy in each Member country needs to find\r\nexpression on the international plane as well. In the course\r\nof the last few years, we have agonized over the process of\r\nreform within this Organization. We all want an efficient\r\nand revitalized United Nations — one that is more attuned\r\nto the realities we live with and capable of meeting the new\r\nchallenges we face. We must reform its methods of work\r\nand bring greater institutional and policy coherence into the\r\nOrganization. Adjustment and realignment are necessary\r\nprocesses for the renewal and continued relevance of this\r\nOrganization. Tanzania salutes all those individuals,\r\ninstitutions and Governments that have contributed to this\r\nprocess of review.\r\nIt is our hope, however, that any reform will preserve\r\nand enhance the basic principles underlying the United\r\nNations. We want reform — but only the kind of reform\r\nthat will ultimately strengthen the hand of our Organization\r\nin promoting its ideals. We want greater transparency in the\r\nwork of our institutions, and the reinforcement of the\r\nprinciples of sovereign equality of States and justice. We\r\nneed democratization of our institutions, and greater balance\r\nin representation on the Security Council between the\r\ndeveloped North and the developing South.\r\nWe cannot, however, expect the United Nations to\r\nbe, and do, all this and more without giving it the means\r\nwith which to work. Meeting our financial obligations to\r\nthe Organization must, therefore, complement our\r\ndemands upon the Organization and serve to demonstrate\r\nour commitment to the ideals it seeks to promote.\r\nJust as we have the right to applaud the\r\nachievements of the United Nations, we must also have\r\nthe courage to concede that it has yet to make a dent in\r\nthe scourge of abject poverty that afflicts the greater part\r\nof its membership. This is where we must now direct its\r\nattention and resources. The 1995 World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in Copenhagen was a good starting\r\npoint, and we must implement the letter and spirit of the\r\ncommitments made there. Unless the issue of poverty is\r\naddressed comprehensively, we cannot achieve\r\nmeaningful and enduring peace. We must restore the\r\ndevelopment agenda to the heart of the philosophy and\r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\nThe world is largely considered peaceful because\r\nthere has not been a third world war. Yet, for those who\r\nare menaced by regional conflicts, for the victims of\r\noppression and injustice, and for those who subsist in\r\nunremitting poverty amid a world of plenty, their world\r\nis at war. Taken together, these people account for the\r\nlargest part of the world population, and the United\r\nNations must give them the attention they deserve today.\r\nOur United Nations cannot speak of a peaceful world\r\nwhen the future of our children — and their right to grow\r\nup as children — is undermined by conflict and poverty,\r\nand when urban squalor is breeding anarchy in local\r\ncommunities. Peace must be pursued in a comprehensive\r\nmanner, taking account of these equal, if not greater,\r\nthreats to peace within societies and among countries.\r\nOur collective shame at poverty amid riches must\r\nfind expression in our joint action to promote\r\ndevelopment. Today, the developing world is bombarded\r\nby many development initiatives. We are urged to work\r\nharder, to liberalize our economies, to cut Government\r\nspending, to institute sound macroeconomic policies, to\r\npromote the private sector and a host of other measures.\r\nInvariably, our countries have done so, quite often at\r\ngreat social expense, the magnitude of which developed\r\ncountries would not countenance in their own economies.\r\nWe have done so in the knowledge that ultimately it\r\nis we who must take the bull by the horns. Indeed, we\r\naccept that we must be more competitive in the market\r\nplace and bring greater efficiency to Government. We\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nneed to use our resources more rationally; we need to fight\r\nwaste and corruption in Government; we need to streamline\r\nour bureaucratic processes, liberalize our economies and\r\nopen our markets to international commerce. That is why\r\nmost of us are signatories to the establishment of the new\r\nworld trade regime under the auspices of the World Trade\r\nOrganization. Yet our capacity to access, and benefit from,\r\nthe global markets — the markets of the developed\r\nworld — is constrained by our underdevelopment, the\r\nprotectionist policies of the industrialized countries, and the\r\never-deteriorating terms of trade.\r\nUnregulated market forces will not help the very\r\nweak, poor and vulnerable countries, whose special\r\ncircumstances and needs must be attended to. For us, that\r\nis the priority agenda for the World Trade Organization, not\r\nthe introduction of new issues before we perfect the system\r\nwe have now. The Ruggiero plan to extend tariff-free\r\naccess in the markets of industrialized countries to products\r\nfrom developing countries is welcome and deserves wide\r\nsupport.\r\nWe now need a mutually beneficial creative\r\npartnership between the developed North and the\r\ndeveloping South. Sustainable economic recovery and\r\ngrowth in the South is beneficial to the North as well. Only\r\na prosperous South will be a more meaningful player in\r\nglobal commerce. We shall then be able to buy more from\r\nthe North, thus freeing the conscience of the developed\r\nworld from the unending obligation to extend charity, and\r\ncontrol illegal immigration. This creative partnership must\r\nalso recognize the interdependent nature of our world and\r\nhow ultimately we affect each other. To help the South\r\nrecover is not an act of simple charity but of building the\r\nfoundations for a more secure and stable world. We made\r\na call for action at the ninth United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD IX) at Midrand in\r\nSouth Africa earlier this year. We must reiterate that call\r\ntoday.\r\nTanzania, like the rest of the developing countries, is\r\ndetermined to face its responsibilities for economic and\r\nhuman development. We cannot, however, make\r\nmeaningful progress when the millstone of external debt\r\ncontinues to hang around our necks, stifling recovery and\r\ngrowth. The question of the unbearable external debt must\r\nbe addressed urgently if our creative partnership against\r\nglobal poverty is to bear fruit.\r\nMany proposals for debt relief have been discussed\r\nover time. We recognize and appreciate these initiatives,\r\nincluding the recent proposals for extraordinary debt relief\r\nmeasures for a selected group of severely indebted\r\ncountries. The fact remains, however, that no\r\ncomprehensive action is imminent save for limited\r\nmeasures taken unilaterally, on a case-by-case basis.\r\nUrgent, coordinated and comprehensive action remains\r\nnecessary to alleviate this debt burden, including the\r\ncancellation of the debts of least developed countries,\r\nwhose servicing obligations gobble up their entire\r\nearnings. Only then can we hope for an economic\r\nturnaround for them. It is the duality of debt cancellation\r\nand access to markets that will enable countries like\r\nTanzania to benefit in a liberalized world market place,\r\nand hasten the pace of social and economic development.\r\nAnother heavy burden for developing countries,\r\nespecially those without fossil fuel sources of energy, is\r\nthe cost input of energy for development. In this\r\nconnection, I wish to hail the World Solar Summit, held\r\non 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare, which helped to\r\nfocus world political attention on the urgent and\r\nimperative need to provide reliable, sustainable and clean\r\nsources of energy to all the people of the world, including\r\nto the 400 million homes and the 2.4 billion people in the\r\ndeveloping world who currently have no access to\r\nelectricity. We all know that, without electricity, no rapid\r\ndevelopment of those communities will be forthcoming.\r\nThe Harare Summit agreed on a framework for a\r\n10-year solar energy programme. We must all give it the\r\npolitical support it needs and deserves if it is to be\r\neffective. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,\r\nwe all agreed that failure to develop sustainable and clean\r\nsources of energy would result in problems for all of us,\r\nrich and poor alike. Deforestation in Africa, Latin\r\nAmerica and Asia will affect the countries involved and\r\nnot involved alike. As long as 92.8 per cent of the energy\r\nrequirements in Tanzania are met from wood fuel, there\r\nis no way that the Government can protect the natural\r\nforests unless alternative sources of energy are available\r\nat affordable rates. It is in the interest of all humanity and\r\nof future generations to facilitate the development of\r\nalternative, affordable, sustainable and clean sources of\r\nenergy for everyone.\r\nTanzania is concerned at the lack of progress in the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations peace plan for\r\nWestern Sahara. The international community cannot and\r\nmust not retreat from this unfinished business. We must\r\nreaffirm the inalienable right of the Sahraoui people to\r\nself-determination and independence and, to that end,\r\nsupport the holding of a free and fair referendum. We\r\nurge the two sides, the Kingdom of Morocco and the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nFrente Polisario, to initiate direct talks, which would create\r\na climate of confidence and permit the resumption of the\r\nimplementation of the settlement plan.\r\nWe wish to keep our hopes alive with regard to the\r\nsituation in the Middle East and earnestly call for faster and\r\nstrict implementation of the peace accords. The Israeli\r\nGovernment has a particular responsibility in this respect.\r\nWe reached a time when we thought that our dreams for\r\nthe peaceful coexistence of the Palestinian people and the\r\nIsraeli people were on the verge of coming true. We\r\ncommend all those who have been instrumental in\r\npromoting the peace process. We urge greater restraint on\r\nall sides, which must accept that the secure way to\r\nsustainable peace and security is through negotiation.\r\nI shall now turn to the Burundi crisis. We see our role\r\nin Burundi as one not of benevolence, but of duty — duty\r\nto help our brothers and sisters there to step back from the\r\nbrink of mutual destruction to the middle ground of\r\ndialogue, political accommodation and national\r\nreconciliation. We began our efforts within the Organization\r\nof African Unity and gradually turned over the task of\r\nbringing the political forces in sustained dialogue to former\r\nPresident, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, within the framework\r\nof the Mwanza talks. Not only was the military coup of 25\r\nJuly 1996 an illegal and unconstitutional act; it also\r\nundermined the efforts in the region to promote dialogue\r\nand restore peace to that most tormented country. The coup\r\nis unacceptable to all regional leaders and we demand a\r\nreturn to legitimacy and a negotiated political settlement\r\nthat will guarantee democracy and the security of\r\nminorities.\r\nIn order to speed up the process of compliance, the\r\nregion has imposed economic sanctions on Burundi. Those\r\nsanctions will remain in place until all the conditions set at\r\nArusha are met by the military rulers in Bujumbura. These\r\nare not unreasonable conditions. They are the restoration of\r\nthe National Assembly, which is a democratic institution of\r\nlegality that derived its mandate from the Burundian people;\r\nremoving the ban on political parties in the country; and the\r\nresumption of unconditional political negotiations with all\r\nthe parties to the conflict. We have, at the same time, made\r\nit clear to the Burundi people that the sanctions are meant\r\nonly to secure the compliance of their military rulers with\r\nthese conditions, and nothing more. Once this has been\r\ndone, Tanzania, the region and, indeed, the international\r\ncommunity have all reiterated that they are prepared to\r\nresume their assistance and cooperation in the process of\r\nrestoring peace and rebuilding that country. We can all\r\npledge our help, but the challenge of making peace is one\r\nthat only the Burundian people and those who claim\r\nleadership of that country can shoulder. The onus of\r\nbringing peace to their county rests squarely upon their\r\nshoulders. The key to a sustainable solution is in their\r\nown hands. We can only help.\r\nAt the same time we, the neighbours and the rest of\r\nthe international community, have an inescapable\r\nresponsibility to save the Burundian people from self-\r\ndestruction. We cannot stand by and watch the\r\nperpetuation of killings, the steady degeneration of the\r\nsecurity situation and the catastrophe they portend for the\r\ncountry and the subregion.\r\nAs we seek to help the Burundian people retrace the\r\npath of dialogue, we remain preoccupied by the fragility\r\nof the political situation in the Great Lakes region as a\r\nwhole. While Rwanda is steadily progressing along the\r\npath of recovery, the wounds of war and genocide have\r\nyet to heal. That country needs the solidarity and support\r\nof the international community.\r\nOne of the serious consequences of conflict in the\r\nregion has been the massive human displacement, and\r\nrefugees now constitute a tremendous burden for the\r\nneighbouring countries. Tanzania is currently hosting over\r\n1 million refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. The\r\nimplications of their presence in such large numbers\r\nwithin limited localities have been tremendous in terms of\r\nthe destruction of the environment, increased insecurity\r\nand criminality, and the social and economic burden they\r\nhave imposed upon the host communities. The traditional\r\nhospitality of Tanzanians towards refugees is wearing\r\nvery thin indeed.\r\nWe appreciate the work of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and other\r\nhumanitarian agencies in offering protection and succour\r\nto the refugees. What they have done is very useful, but\r\nit is not enough to offset the burden that these refugees\r\nplace upon our communities. We call upon the\r\ninternational community, in the name of human solidarity,\r\nto redouble its assistance to meet the urgent needs of\r\nthese refugees, while at the same time addressing the\r\nlong-term effects attendant on hosting them. Above all,\r\nwe must help both Rwanda and Burundi to address the\r\nroot causes of these human displacements. The ultimate\r\ngoal must be the voluntary repatriation of the refugees to\r\ntheir home countries. To us, the creation of an\r\nenvironment that will facilitate such a process of\r\nrepatriation is now a priority.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nWhether in Liberia, Somalia or elsewhere in the\r\nworld, we see the need for courage and statesmanship to\r\ndefeat the temptations of political unilateralism and promote\r\ndialogue and greater human solidarity. The courage to rise\r\nabove deep-seated prejudices and fears — the courage to\r\ndepart from traditional rigidity that has made conflict\r\nendemic in some parts of the world — is the key that will\r\nopen up a new era of dialogue, political accommodation\r\nand national concord. We have seen how such courage and\r\nstatesmanship can reverse long-standing hostilities and build\r\non the realism of our shared destiny as human beings. The\r\nMiddle East, Bosnia and Herzegovina, South Africa and\r\nAngola are cases in point. Difficulties remain, but we have\r\ncrossed the Rubicon and, with determination, we can\r\nmaintain a steady pace towards peace in these and other\r\nareas around the world. The United Nations played a key\r\nrole in this task. It will have to play an even greater role in\r\nconsolidating the progress towards peace.\r\nThe end of the cold war did not, unfortunately, usher\r\nin the spring of collective peace and the blossoming of the\r\nflowers of international cooperation. The world is still\r\ndivided — even if not on ideological lines — between\r\nthose who are armed and those who are unarmed. Vast\r\nnuclear arsenals remain and their technological\r\nimprovement continues unabated. The hopes for collective\r\npeace run the risk of being thwarted by the unilateralism of\r\nthose who are armed with the most deadly weapons. My\r\ncountry is concerned about the vertical proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and the unremitting desire of\r\nthose who have them to rationalize their possession. This\r\nundermines peace.\r\nSince the coming into force two years ago of the 1982\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we have\r\nwitnessed the establishment of the various institutions\r\nenvisaged in the Convention. We are pleased that, at long\r\nlast, there is positive movement towards ensuring the\r\nregularized use of the oceans and their resources to the\r\nbenefit of all people the world over. The Government of\r\nTanzania attaches great importance to ensuring that the\r\nmake-up of the International Seabed Authority in its\r\nformative years is so structured as to facilitate the carrying\r\nout of its responsibilities in the manner envisaged in the\r\nConvention and implementation Agreement of 1994.\r\nThe establishment of the International Tribunal on the\r\nLaw of the Sea has added a fillip to the Convention, and\r\nthe election of its judges last August was another milestone\r\nin the work of the United Nations. In this connection, we\r\nexpress our appreciation to the States Parties to the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea for electing a Tanzanian,\r\nThe Honourable Joseph S. Warioba, as one of the judges\r\nof the Tribunal. We congratulate all members of the\r\nTribunal on being entrusted with such an historic mission.\r\nThe founding of the United Nations was inspired by\r\nthe human solidarity which the world sought to promote\r\nfive decades ago. It is that solidarity which our nations\r\ngathered here last year to commemorate. What holds our\r\nnations together, despite their diversity, is the common\r\nbond and solidarity we feel for each other as human\r\nbeings.\r\nToday, more than ever before, we need that\r\nsolidarity in order to deal with the myriad problems we\r\nall face together: the problems of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment, peace and security, justice and human\r\nrights, disarmament and the environment, international\r\nterrorism and drug trafficking and many others. All\r\nrequire joint and coordinated international action. Those\r\nmore powerful amongst us can try to solve these\r\nproblems unilaterally, but in order for their efforts to bear\r\nfruit, they too need the cooperation of everyone. That is\r\nwhy I invite this Assembly to embark on a mission to\r\nrediscover human solidarity and to build structures for\r\nglobal partnership, the better world which the founding\r\nfathers of this Organization set out to establish 51 years\r\nago.\r\nAs an African leader, I wish to end my speech by\r\ncommending and supporting the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General for the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa he launched on 15 March of\r\nthis year, which seeks to provide coordinated action\r\nacross the entire United Nations system over a 10-year\r\nperiod to address the unique development needs of the\r\nAfrican continent. It is my hope that coming in the wake\r\nof the Copenhagen Social Summit, it will benefit from\r\nthat Summit’s commitments and create the kind of impact\r\nthat has long been missing in previous summit\r\ndeclarations and plans of action.\r\nAfrica is a continent with an ancient and rich\r\nhistory. It is richly endowed with human and natural\r\nresources. I have great hopes for Africa and, being part of\r\nits new leadership, I pledge to work with anyone who\r\nshares my conviction that Africa is positioned for political\r\nand economic renewal, reform and reconstruction for\r\ndevelopment. Together, we can realize the dream of a\r\nmore peaceful, a more developed and a more respected\r\ncontinent. Together, we can realize the dream of a world\r\ncloser than ever to the ideals set out in the United Nations\r\nCharter over 50 years ago.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Benjamin William Mkapa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Mr. Vaughan Lewis, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Finance, Planning and\r\nDevelopment, Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and\r\nInformation of Saint Lucia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,\r\nPlanning and Development, Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs\r\nand Information of Saint Lucia.\r\nThe Honourable Mr. Vaughan Lewis, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Finance, Planning and Development,\r\nForeign Affairs, Home Affairs and Information of\r\nSaint Lucia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance, Planning and\r\nDevelopment, Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and\r\nInformation of Saint Lucia, His Excellency The Honourable\r\nMr. Vaughan Lewis, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Lewis (Saint Lucia): One year ago,\r\nrepresentatives of Member States gathered in this hallowed\r\nHall and sang songs of praise in honour of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of this venerable Organization. One year ago,\r\nwe faced the challenges of a changing international system\r\nand the dawn of the new millennium with courage and hope\r\nand in the belief that its noble ideals would guide the\r\nactions of States, great and small, in their relations with\r\ntheir fellow Members.\r\nBut now that the cheering and shouting have died and\r\nthe vivid memories of the fiftieth anniversary celebrations\r\nhave started to wane, small countries like ours, Saint Lucia,\r\nare forced to face the realities of survival — realities far\r\nharsher than what the bliss of that anniversary promised.\r\nIt will be difficult to forget the lofty principles\r\nexpounded during the anniversary or the excitement of\r\ncelebrating the historic liquidation of apartheid in South\r\nAfrica and the restoration of democracy in Haiti. But the\r\nspeeches of this Assembly had hardly faded, the lights of\r\nthis Hall hardly dimmed, when my country Saint Lucia\r\nand its sister islands of the Caribbean began to feel the\r\nfull blast of international hostility towards the\r\narrangements for the marketing of our main export\r\ncommodity, the banana, in the European Union,\r\narrangements which are enshrined in the treaty\r\nestablishing the Fourth Lomé Convention between the\r\nEuropean Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific\r\nStates.\r\nThe reality of size and vulnerability always creates\r\nan awareness, a perception and a kind of resilience in\r\nsmall States that make them philosophical about adversity.\r\nConsequently, we will continue to support the high ideals\r\nof this institution, but today we must focus on the hard\r\noptions presented to us by the myopia of some large\r\ntrading nations.\r\nAt the historic fiftieth session of this Assembly,\r\nSaint Lucia took the opportunity to spell out to the\r\nnations of the world the very serious consequences which\r\nwould befall our small Caribbean economies if certain\r\ncountries pursued their intention to challenge the\r\nEuropean banana regime by invoking Section 301 action\r\nat the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United\r\nStates of America itself is now pursuing this action in\r\nresponse to an application by certain American\r\nmultinational companies involved in the trade, and other\r\nlarge banana-producing countries have followed their lead.\r\nThe battle is now fully engaged within the World\r\nTrade Organization, but the conditions of war are\r\nanything but equal and the playing field is anything but\r\neven. For example, at the behest of the complainants, the\r\nsmall countries of the Caribbean have been denied full\r\nparticipation in the hearings of the WTO panel, despite\r\nthe fact that we are the ones who will be most affected by\r\nthe WTO ruling, whatever that may be.\r\nThe diplomatic war being waged against the\r\nmarketing arrangements of our main export commodity in\r\nthe name of free trade emphasizes to small nations the\r\nmonumental insensitivity of some of those participating in\r\nthe process of globalization and trade liberalization now\r\nsweeping the international community. In a process that\r\nignores the special circumstances of the small and the\r\nvulnerable, nations like Saint Lucia and regions like the\r\nCaribbean can quickly become marginalized.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nLet it be understood that we are not against the\r\nprocess of change in world trade, the globalization of the\r\nworld economy or the economic integration of continents,\r\na process currently under way. We do not wish to be\r\nLuddites in our view of the evolving international system\r\nand thus we welcome these directions. But, on behalf of the\r\npeoples whom we represent, on behalf of the peoples of all\r\nsmall States, we have the right to point out the dangers\r\nthese trends pose for small, developing economies if\r\ncompensating mechanisms are not put in place. We need to\r\ntell the world that these trends, these changes in\r\ninternational economic affairs, have not lessened the\r\nvulnerability of small developing States, but have in some\r\nrespects accentuated them. We need to remind this body\r\nthat, as the international community seeks to fashion a new\r\nglobal economic system, it is imperative that it not lose\r\nsight of the special needs of small States, particularly small\r\nisland developing countries.\r\nThe untrammelled pursuit of free trade for the sake of\r\nfree trade cannot be the guiding philosophy of our Member\r\nStates. Unbridled free trade which relegates some Member\r\nStates, and in particular those with small open economies,\r\nto the position of suffering spectators cannot be acceptable.\r\nIt is even less acceptable when we realize that some of the\r\nvery nations that are championing the case of unrestricted\r\ntrade liberalization do not themselves scrupulously observe\r\nthat philosophy. Some of them grant huge subsidies to their\r\nfarmers in order to allow them to continue in production,\r\nyet they complain that our small farmers are not efficient\r\nproducers.\r\nConsequently, it is incumbent on the international\r\ncommunity to make provisions for the special needs of\r\nsmall States in this rapidly changing international system.\r\nIn the creation of free-trade areas that span continents and\r\nintegrate hemispheres, there must be special provisions for\r\nthe very small economies of our countries, particularly in\r\nregions where there are small island developing States. In\r\nthat regard, we welcome the fact that, in the discussions on\r\nthe proposed free-trade area of the Americas, a working\r\ngroup on smaller economies has been established to\r\nfacilitate the participation of the small economies in that\r\nprocess.\r\nFor despite the changing features of the international\r\nsystem, the forces that threaten the existence of these States\r\nhave not altered. Small island States are still very\r\nvulnerable, for example, to natural disasters. Some of the\r\neconomies of our fellow Member States from the Caribbean\r\nhave yet to recover from the effects of the ravages of last\r\nyear’s hurricanes. And in the island of Montserrat, we have\r\na classic example of the magnitude of the damage which\r\na natural disaster — in this case persistent volcanic\r\nactivity — can wreak on small island developing\r\neconomies.\r\nThe plight of that small Territory is an extreme but\r\ntragically powerful symbol of why the special needs of\r\nsmall island developing States cannot be ignored as the\r\ninternational community seeks to define new rules and\r\neconomic relationships for the next millennium. The\r\ninternational community and international economic\r\ninstitutions must therefore bear in mind that, while they\r\nhave categorized some of us as middle-income developing\r\ncountries and therefore as no longer requiring\r\nconcessionary aid flows, the economic indices utilized to\r\narrive at these classifications cannot mask the continuing\r\nreality of the vulnerability of these countries.\r\nWe will, however, continue within the severe\r\nlimitations of size and resources to diversify and\r\nrestructure our economies, to increase efficiency and\r\nproductivity and to adapt to the new realities. We will\r\nrely on the support of States Members of this\r\nOrganization in this regard.\r\nThere are other States in the Caribbean whose\r\nparticular situation also deserves the special attention of\r\nthis body. Saint Lucia once again urges the international\r\ncommunity to increase its technical, economic and\r\nfinancial assistance to Haiti to foster development and\r\nstability in that sister country of ours. The end of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission should not diminish international\r\ndevelopment support for Haiti. This is even more urgently\r\nneeded now to maintain and strengthen the gains achieved\r\nin the restoration of what is still a fledgling democracy\r\nand to enhance its fragile stability.\r\nAgain, Saint Lucia joins its Caribbean colleagues in\r\ncalling for an end to the economic blockade of Cuba.\r\nThree decades of denial have not achieved democracy.\r\nThe economic embargo against Cuba is a policy which\r\ncan hardly be called relevant in this era and it is therefore\r\ntime to try the more effective alternative of dialogue,\r\ndiscourse and openness.\r\nIn the wider international community, we are\r\nheartened by the new impetus given to the revitalization\r\nand development of Africa and encourage Member States\r\nto continue to support this initiative. But we are saddened\r\nby the persistence of ethnic disturbances in some areas of\r\nthat continent — ethnic troubles which only serve to\r\nimpede the very development process which Member\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nStates are trying to promote. We therefore urge the United\r\nNations and regional organizations in Africa to develop\r\nmechanisms for conciliation with regard to these conflicts.\r\nSaint Lucia also wishes to express its deep concern at\r\nthe recent revival of conflict in the Middle East. Is it not\r\ntime to end the anguish, to stop the pain? Is it not time to\r\nhalt the shedding of the blood of the ordinary people of\r\nthese lands? Is it not time to bring a permanent peace to a\r\nland that means so much to so much of mankind? But the\r\npath to true peace can only be through dialogue and\r\nconciliation and we urge all parties to return to this road,\r\nfor anything which is not built on that foundation will not\r\nstand.\r\nWhile Saint Lucia continues to promote the unification\r\nof China, we still hold the view that Taiwan should be\r\ngiven the opportunity to participate in and contribute to the\r\nwork of the United Nations. Taiwan is a vibrant and\r\ngrowing democracy, capable of meeting its obligations to\r\nthis institution. As a highly developed economy, Taiwan is\r\nalso capable of contributing to the growth of other smaller,\r\nless developed economies of the world. At a time when the\r\nPowers that have traditionally assisted the economic\r\ndevelopment of our countries have significantly reduced the\r\nlevel and quality of their support, new sources of assistance\r\nshould not be ignored. We are confident that this body can\r\nfind a creative mechanism through which Taiwan can be\r\ninvolved in the programmes of the Organization. That\r\ninvolvement in the work of the United Nations should in no\r\nway preclude unification.\r\nWe hope that this fifty-first session will not conclude\r\nwithout significant progress in correcting the inequitable\r\ncomposition of the Security Council. Saint Lucia will\r\ncontinue to work within our regional and other groups to\r\nachieve the goal of strengthening the relationship between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council,\r\ninstitutionalizing the process of briefing and consultation\r\nand developing greater transparency and predictability.\r\nAs a small nation caught up in the dynamics of\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization, Saint Lucia looks\r\neagerly and hopefully to the principles and ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations to offer some comfort, some protection and\r\nsome measure of security in our uncertain entry into the\r\nnew century. All the indications that herald the approach of\r\nthis new age seem to tell us that small nations should find\r\ntheir path to development through the process of\r\nintegration.\r\nWe as a nation have a solid track record in\r\nattempting to forge deep and meaningful links between all\r\nStates members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean\r\nStates and the Caribbean Community. In both\r\norganizations, we continue to build viable mechanisms\r\nand institutions which will achieve a meaningful\r\nconsolidation of the various units of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity. We have progressed even further and\r\nparticipated in the launching of a brave initiative, the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States. This Association ignores\r\nthe barriers of race, language and culture and seeks to\r\nunify all countries which border and are part of the\r\nCaribbean Sea.\r\nWe urge this Organization, through its various\r\nagencies, to continue to provide support for the regional\r\nintegration efforts of developing countries. On many\r\noccasions in the past, it has been the work of some of the\r\nUnited Nations agencies which has helped sustain some\r\nof these regional economic integration schemes and given\r\nthem the impetus to move forward. For its part, Saint\r\nLucia will continue to toil in the cause of the closer union\r\nof the peoples and States of the Caribbean because this is\r\nthe only logic for our survival. This is the path to the\r\nenhancement of the quality of life of our peoples.\r\nThe plight which our country faces as a result of the\r\nmanipulation of the European banana market regime and\r\nof the unconscionable pressures exerted by the activities\r\nof some States on that market, is desperate. We wish to\r\nremind the Assembly that we are relying on the principles\r\nand ideals of this body to stand firmly in the corner of the\r\nsmall and vulnerable and to frustrate the designs of some\r\nmultinational corporations which threaten our livelihood.\r\nWe reiterate our call to the United Nations to develop a\r\nframework of international review and regulations\r\nregarding the activities and policies of transnational\r\ncorporations, which are assuming leviathan proportions in\r\nworld trade.\r\nI commend you, Sir, on your elevation to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at fifty-first session\r\nand pledge Saint Lucia’s support for the successful\r\nexecution of your enormous responsibilities. My country\r\nalso pledges with customary diligence to assist the United\r\nNations in implementing the goals of the Charter and\r\nfostering the spirit of freedom and independence which\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary year of the Organization\r\nemphasized. Our small size will not be a deterrent in our\r\npursuit of democracy and peace.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Fiance, Planning and Development, Foreign Affairs,\r\nHome Affairs and Information of Saint Lucia for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Vaughan Lewis, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Finance, Planning and Development,\r\nForeign Affairs, Home Affairs and Information of\r\nSaint Lucia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Mozambique, His Excellency\r\nMr. Leonardo Santos Simão.\r\nMr. Simão (Mozambique): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, and on my own behalf, I wish to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. I am convinced\r\nthat your qualities of a gifted diplomat devoted to the cause\r\nof peace and understanding among peoples will ensure a\r\nsuccessful outcome of our deliberations. I pledge my\r\ndelegation’s full support as you discharge your noble\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nI would like to seize this opportunity to commend the\r\nbrilliant manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Freitas do\r\nAmaral of Portugal, presided over the proceedings of the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nLet me also pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for\r\nhis continued contribution and personal commitment to the\r\nideals of international peace and security.\r\nWe celebrate today the fourth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of a peaceful Mozambique after a long period\r\nof uncertainty in our history. It has been a period of great\r\nchallenges and sacrifices, but also of great excitement for\r\nall Mozambicans. With peace, we are gradually healing the\r\nwounds caused by the war and our young multi-party\r\ndemocracy is flourishing and consolidating its roots. The\r\nAssembly of the Republic, our Parliament, has been\r\nmeeting regularly, symbolizing our collective desire to work\r\ntogether for the consolidation of peace, national\r\nreconstruction and democracy. Similarly, efforts are being\r\nmade to implement the Government’s five-year programme,\r\nin which the reduction of absolute poverty, with emphasis\r\non education, health, rural development and job creation,\r\ncontinues to be our major objective.\r\nAt the same time, preparations are being made with\r\na view to beginning next year the holding of municipal\r\nelections, thus complementing the process initiated in\r\n1994 with the holding of the first multi-party general and\r\npresidential elections. In view of financial and other\r\nconstraints, the Government anticipates that municipal\r\nelections will take place on a gradual basis. However, the\r\nfinal decision will be made by the Assembly of the\r\nRepublic itself, following the completion of the ongoing\r\ndebate on the subject.\r\nWhat is important in our view is that elections take\r\nplace, for they represent an opportunity for the people to\r\nchoose their local representatives, identify and solve local\r\nproblems and define their own needs and priorities. The\r\nGovernment is also addressing, as a matter of urgency,\r\nthe establishment and strengthening of all the different\r\ntribunals envisaged in the Constitution, with a view to\r\nenabling the normal functioning of the judiciary system as\r\nan important step forward in the efforts to strengthen the\r\nrule of law, democracy and respect for individual rights\r\nand freedoms.\r\nFurthermore, we continue to be fully committed to\r\nensuring public safety and security. To this end, my\r\nGovernment has recently submitted to donor countries a\r\nproject proposal in order to begin the process of\r\nupgrading the technical capacity of the police, thus\r\nenabling that institution to deal more effectively with\r\ncrime prevention, control and other challenges. These\r\ninclude continuing the search for and destruction of arms\r\nthroughout the country and dealing with transnational\r\ncrimes, particularly drug trafficking and money\r\nlaundering.\r\nFurthermore, demining continues to be one of my\r\nGovernment’s top priorities. For us, demining is not an\r\nend per se. Rather, it is a process which we regard as an\r\nintegral part of the overall national development process.\r\nWhere possible, it has been our policy to stimulate the\r\nlaunching of agricultural production and related activities\r\nonce demining is completed. However, given the\r\nmagnitude of the land-mine issue in Mozambique,\r\nresulting from many years of conflict, additional resources\r\nare needed effectively to address this problem in the years\r\nahead, in particular within the framework of strengthening\r\nthe national capacity for demining.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to express my\r\ngratitude to all those countries and organizations which\r\nhave contributed to the demining programme in\r\nMozambique. We look forward to continuing work\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\ntogether with a view to eliminating these horrible weapons\r\nnot only in Mozambique, but also in all countries affected\r\nby this evil. Accordingly, and in line with my last year’s\r\nstatement before this Assembly, my Government reiterate\r\nsits full support to the call for an international agreement\r\nagainst the production, stockpiling and use of anti-personal\r\nland-mines.\r\nRecently, my Government and the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\nconcluded the repatriation and resettlement of Mozambican\r\ncitizens who had sought refuge in neighbouring countries\r\nduring the armed conflict. This programme, initiated as a\r\nresult of a memorandum of understanding signed in March\r\n1993 with UNHCR and subsequent agreements, has been\r\nregarded as one of the biggest and most successful\r\nrepatriation programmes ever undertaken by UNHCR.\r\nThanks to this programme, around 1.7 million\r\nMozambicans have safely and voluntarily returned to their\r\nplaces of origin. We are now proud to say that there are no\r\nmore Mozambicans living abroad as refugees.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nHowever, the challenges before us are immense. We\r\nare aware of the difficulties facing this segment of our\r\npopulation and the long road still ahead before we can\r\ndeclare them economically safe and ready to live on their\r\nown. This is where the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity is most needed and appreciated.\r\nWith the end of the repatriation process and the\r\nresettlement of these populations, there has been significant\r\nprogress in agricultural production. As a matter of fact,\r\nrecorded agricultural output in certain areas of Mozambique\r\nthis year is the highest since independence. The main\r\nproblem we face now is that of the financial capacity to\r\nbuy and store adequately the surplus of this production. We\r\nneed support to build warehouses within the framework of\r\nthe food security programme.\r\nLike many other developing countries, Mozambique\r\nhas been undergoing a structural adjustment programme\r\nsince 1987. The core objectives of the programme were,\r\ninter alia, to create and adjust the country’s macroeconomic\r\npolicy, ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for\r\nthe development of a strong market economy, provide a\r\ntransparent and accountable policy framework aimed at\r\npromoting investment, allocate adequate budgetary\r\nresources for social programmes, create the necessary\r\nconditions for the establishment and consolidation of\r\ndemocratic institutions and support good governance and\r\npolitical stability.\r\nAfter almost 10 years of implementation of this\r\nprogramme under the most adverse conditions, some\r\nprogress has been achieved. Nevertheless, the overall\r\nobjectives, including specifically the upgrading of the\r\nliving standards of the population, are still far from being\r\nachieved. In some cases living standards of working\r\npeople have, in fact, deteriorated in recent years, which\r\nmay erode the political support needed for the\r\ncontinuation of the reforms.\r\nAs of next year, Mozambique will have to start\r\nmeeting its debt-servicing obligations to multilateral\r\ninstitutions, as this category of debt has not been eligible\r\nfor rescheduling so far. The debt burden, coupled with\r\nvery restrictive monetary policies and related measures\r\npursued in connection with the structural adjustment\r\nprogramme, will certainly have a serious negative impact\r\non the performance of the national economy. Unless\r\nmeasures are taken to address this situation, it will be\r\nvery difficult for the country to sustain the envisaged\r\npolitical, economic and social targets required to uplift the\r\nliving standards of the people. The situation of my\r\ncountry’s indebtedness is a critical one, indeed, as it has\r\nincreased by about six per cent during the last two years.\r\nIn 1994, debt servicing alone absorbed about 93 per cent\r\nof the country’s total export earnings and represented\r\nabout 28.6 per cent of gross domestic product. This\r\nscenario is likely to remain, under the prevailing\r\ncircumstances, for the next few years. Therefore, my\r\nGovernment supports the view that a comprehensive\r\neffort should be made to effectively address the external\r\nindebtedness of developing countries, in particular the\r\nleast developed countries undertaking painful structural\r\nadjustment programmes and whose growth prospects\r\ncontinue to be severely undermined by this burden.\r\nIn order to address official bilateral debt problems,\r\nthe Naples Terms, adopted by the Paris Club, in favour of\r\nthe poorest and most indebted countries should be\r\nexpeditiously implemented. At the same time, we believe\r\nnon-Paris Club creditors which have not done so should\r\nalso consider taking appropriate relief measures to\r\nalleviate the suffering of debtor nations. Measures\r\nannounced at the recently held Lyon Summit could not\r\nhave been more timely. We look forward to welcoming\r\ntheir early implementation.\r\nAs I speak on this subject, I would like to launch an\r\nemphatic appeal for a closer partnership between debtors\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nand creditors. We have recently been pleased to note that,\r\nat the political level, there appears to be a growing\r\nunderstanding of developing countries’ concerns over the\r\nissue of the external debt crisis. We would therefore be\r\ndeeply appreciative if this understanding were translated\r\ninto tangible results and if the subsequent technical\r\ndiscussions held following political consultations were\r\nmuch more fruitful. Regrettably, this has not always been\r\nthe case. A comprehensive approach to assist least\r\ndeveloped countries through a flexible implementation of\r\nexisting instruments and through finding new mechanisms,\r\nis necessary. These include improvements in capital and\r\ninvestment flows and an increase in real terms of the\r\nofficial development assistance to least developed countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nTo this end, we call upon donor countries,\r\ninternational financial institutions and United Nations\r\norgans and specialized agencies to effectively participate in\r\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nleast developed countries for the 1990s, the mid-term\r\nreview of which was held in September last year.\r\nSimilarly, my delegation welcomes the recently\r\nlaunched United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica, for it brings a new impetus to the international\r\ncommunity’s awareness of the necessity to bring about a\r\nmeaningful solution to African problems. Additional efforts\r\nshould be made to prevent repetition of past experiences\r\nduring the implementation of similar important initiatives,\r\nby ensuring a successful implementation of this one. The\r\nrecent mid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa has highlighted the positive\r\nchanges made in the right direction during the last few\r\nyears on the African continent. These trends should be\r\nsupported and encouraged by the international community.\r\nIn this regard, my Government hopes that the report\r\nbeing prepared by a group of experts led by Ms. Graça\r\nMachel, in conformity with the General Assembly\r\nresolution 48/157 of 20 December 1993, will contribute\r\nsignificantly to drawing the international community’s\r\nattention on the fate of children victimized by armed\r\nconflicts in the world, particularly, in Africa.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly offers a\r\nunique opportunity for a collective review of the issue of\r\nconflict resolution in many parts of the world. With respect\r\nto Angola, the recent summit of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) organ on politics,\r\ndefence and security has expressed concern over the slow\r\nprogress and apparent stalemate in the implementation of\r\nthe Lusaka Protocol. The summit expressed, inter alia,\r\ndeep regret over the absence of the União Nacional para\r\na Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) from the\r\nmeeting and made a strong appeal to UNITA to fulfil its\r\ncommitment within the deadline established by the\r\nLusaka Protocol and those of Security Council resolution\r\n864 (1993).\r\nMozambique, along with other SADC countries, is\r\nmaking its contribution to the smooth progress of this\r\ndelicate process. The settlement of the conflict in Angola\r\nwill contribute decisively to the materialization of\r\nstrategic goals set forth by SADC and allow our region to\r\nembark on the process of regional integration and to\r\ndedicate our efforts to the well-being of our peoples.\r\nWithin the recently created Lusophone Community,\r\nor Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, we are\r\nalso working hard to encourage the peace process in\r\nAngola. In doing so, we aim to consolidate the historic\r\nand cultural ties which unite the seven countries that have\r\nPortuguese as their official language, thus creating the\r\nnecessary conditions for a more fruitful cooperation\r\namong them.\r\nWe are encouraged by the recent progress in Sierra\r\nLeone and Rwanda and look forward to a positive\r\noutcome of the crises in those countries. However, we\r\nremain concerned at the prevailing volatile situations in\r\nBurundi, Liberia and Somalia. We welcome all initiatives\r\naimed at finding the needed political settlement of the\r\ncrises in these African countries.\r\nThe recurrence of such long-lasting conflicts remains\r\na serious challenge to the international community as a\r\nwhole and also to the efforts within the framework of the\r\nrecently established Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution. My delegation wishes to commend all the\r\ncountries that have lent their support to the functioning of\r\nthe Mechanism, thus enabling Africans to take a much\r\nmore active role in searching for solutions to the conflicts\r\non their continent.\r\nThe recent outbreak of violence in the Middle East\r\nis a matter of grave concern to my delegation. This\r\nviolence, if not averted urgently, will be a serious setback\r\nto the commendable progress made in the quest for a\r\npolitical settlement to the long-standing conflict in that\r\nregion. We call upon all the parties concerned to exercise\r\nmaximum restraint and to display the needed political\r\nmaturity in the implementation of the mutually agreed\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\ncommitments in the interest of all the peoples of the region.\r\nIn this connection, we are encouraged by the dialogue\r\ninitiated in the recent summit in Washington between the\r\nPrime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian\r\nAuthority with a view to putting an end to violence and\r\nresuming the peace process.\r\nWe have also followed the developments regarding the\r\nissue of East Timor. In making an assessment of the\r\nprogress made so far, one cannot fail to register\r\ndisappointment over the slow pace of talks between\r\nIndonesia and Portugal. Nevertheless, my delegation wishes\r\nto encourage both countries to assume their responsibilities\r\nwith more vigour, with a view to finding a just,\r\ncomprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to\r\nthis issue, bearing in mind the need to allow the people of\r\nEast Timor an opportunity to exercise their political rights,\r\nincluding the right to self-determination.\r\nTime and again, virtually all Member States have\r\nemphasized the critical need to undertake reforms within\r\nthe United Nations so as to ensure greater effectiveness in\r\nits work and to fulfil the sacrosanct principles enshrined in\r\nits Charter. The needed reforms within our Organization\r\nshould not be regarded as an end in themselves. They\r\nshould, inter alia, pave the way for the active and global\r\nparticipation of the developing countries, particularly the\r\nleast developed countries, in the work and procedures of the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Economic and Social Council,\r\nbearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these\r\ncountries in the economic and social challenges facing\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nIn this reform process, the strengthening of the United\r\nNations system, which does not necessarily mean\r\ndownsizing, is of paramount importance. The revitalization\r\nof the role of the Economic and Social Council is long\r\noverdue to allow better coordination and effective and\r\nefficient management of the funds, programmes and\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system. Reforms\r\nshould also reflect the dynamics of international relations\r\nand the growing need for enhanced democracy, equitable\r\ngeographic representation and the changes in the\r\ncomposition of its membership since the establishment of\r\nthe United Nations 51 years ago. Above all, they should\r\nensure the needed legitimacy, transparency and efficiency\r\nof its decisions.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation shares the\r\nfrustrations expressed by a number of delegations regarding\r\nthe lack of tangible progress within the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and other matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil. Since the beginning of its procedures, important\r\nand interesting ideas have been advanced in this regard.\r\nTherefore, nobody can deny the arguments calling for an\r\nexpansion of that body. Lack of progress on the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council will only undermine\r\nthe ability of the United Nations to discharge fully its\r\nobligations and limit the confidence of international\r\npublic opinion on the future of our Organization. It is\r\nonly by addressing the issue of enlargement and by each\r\none’s fulfilling its financial obligations that we can\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter and expect a well-functioning and dynamic\r\nUnited Nations ready to face the challenges of the next\r\ncentury. What is necessary is a genuine political will to\r\nchange the status quo, which has favoured a limited\r\nnumber of Member States to the detriment of the\r\nlegitimate interests of the vast majority of its membership.\r\nIn its 51 years of existence the United Nations,\r\ndespite numerous difficulties during this period, has been\r\nable to achieve its crucial objective of halting the\r\nemergence of a third world war. Therefore, it must be\r\nallowed to continue to preserve the gains already achieved\r\nand draw lessons from mistakes of the past so as to\r\nensure the feasibility of its mandate, as we approach the\r\ntwenty-first century, in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, in monitoring the implementation of\r\nimportant decisions taken in the economic, social and\r\nenvironmental fields and in playing a more dynamic role\r\nin the quest for the development of our countries.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of India, His Excellency Mr. Inder\r\nKumar Gujral.\r\nMr. Gujral (India): It gives me great pleasure to\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession. He is not present here, but I would like to say\r\nthat he is no stranger to India. We are fully cognizant of\r\nhis sagacity and skills and repose our confidence in his\r\nability to successfully guide the General Assembly during\r\nits fifty-first session. May I also express my delegation’s\r\nwarm appreciation for the presidency of his predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for a most\r\nproductive tenure as President of the Assembly in its\r\nhistoric, landmark fiftieth year.\r\nSix years ago I had the privilege of addressing the\r\nhistoric forty-fifth session of this Assembly. We rejoiced\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nat the end of the cold war and believed that the animosities,\r\nrivalries, suspicions and intrigues that had bedeviled the\r\npast would now be overcome and the problems of the\r\nworld and their solutions could be addressed with greater,\r\nperhaps pristine, clarity. We have welcomed the reduction\r\nof global tensions and the opening up of new economic\r\npossibilities between nations.\r\nHowever, we cannot say that the new dawn has led to\r\na new and genuinely cooperative web of kinship and\r\ncollaboration. Regional conflicts and tensions continue to\r\noccupy us. Development problems remain acute, and there\r\nis less sensitivity to the genuine needs of struggling nations.\r\nThe voice of the rich and powerful nations rings louder\r\nthan ever, while the developing world feels itself more\r\nmarginalized and ignored than ever.\r\nIn these circumstances, it is even more necessary to\r\nstrive for a genuine spirit of joint international endeavour\r\nin addressing the world’s problems. The United Nations is\r\nthe foremost embodiment of multilateralism. No single\r\nnation or even group of nations today can expect to find\r\nsolutions to the world’s problems, nor are many problems\r\namenable to solutions in isolation. Global problems require\r\nglobal institutions and global solutions. This role and duty\r\ncan fall only to the United Nations.\r\nWe are concerned at unilateral actions and at the\r\nevident decline in the commitment to obligations under the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. International cooperation is\r\nnecessary to meet the vast development needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries, to eliminate weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and to fight terrorism and crime. The United\r\nNations system, under which sovereign nations have joined\r\ntogether to achieve their common objectives, is the\r\nuniversal framework for international cooperation. The\r\nCharter of the United Nations is the real basis for renewing\r\nmultilateralism. India recently joined 15 other Heads of\r\nState or Government in stating that\r\n“either nations move forward to strengthen\r\n(multilateralism), or we risk having to face more\r\nunilateralism and perhaps conflict and overt disregard\r\nof international law and common values”.\r\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads. Its financial\r\ncrisis is the result of an unwarranted unwillingness on the\r\npart of certain countries to pay their dues in full and on\r\ntime. Such deliberate targeting of the United Nations\r\nrepresents the most acute threat to multilateral cooperation\r\nand can do incalculable long-term damage.\r\nBeyond the financial crisis of the United Nations\r\nitself is the critical issue of financing global cooperation.\r\nWhile the world remains confronted with enormous\r\nproblems of poverty, malnutrition, disease, ecological\r\ndegradation and waste, the will to contribute is on the\r\ndecline. Development assistance is at its lowest level in\r\ndecades. Negotiated replenishments of multilateral\r\ndevelopment funds are not being honoured.\r\nIt is unfortunate that voices continue to be raised\r\nquestioning the role of the United Nations in the\r\neconomic growth and social development of developing\r\ncountries. It is necessary to restore to the United Nations,\r\nin the coming century, the important role of eradicating\r\npoverty and all the ills associated with it, of promoting\r\ndevelopment and achieving social progress and better\r\nliving standards, with more freedom for all.\r\nFor this purpose, the multilateral economic system\r\nneeds to be reformed and the partnership of the United\r\nNations with other relevant institutions must to be\r\nstrengthened in order to achieve greater economic growth,\r\nintegration and sustainable development. The United\r\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions need to\r\ndevelop an effective partnership. While India welcomes\r\nthe initial, tentative steps towards such a partnership,\r\neffective economic leadership requires that we work to\r\nensure a much closer relationship between global\r\neconomic institutions than has been the case so far.\r\nIndeed, there is no alternative if the financing of long-\r\nterm global cooperation in economic and social fields is\r\nto be assured. We need larger volumes of financial\r\nassistance, greater predictability of resources and\r\nunfettered access to the markets of developed countries.\r\nIt is also time that we energize our efforts to complete the\r\nAgenda for Development and launch an effective follow-\r\nup process, including in the context of the recent major\r\nUnited Nations conferences.\r\nIndia is unreservedly committed to the protection\r\nand promotion of human rights. The profoundly\r\nhumanistic traditions of Indian civilization, with its\r\nemphasis on tolerance, harmony, non-violence and the\r\ninviolability of the individual, have been consolidated in\r\nthe Constitution of India, which is indeed a veritable bill\r\nof human rights. All human rights are sacrosanct in India,\r\nguaranteed by its Constitution, an independent judiciary,\r\na free press, public opinion vigorously expressed and an\r\nindependent National Human Rights Commission. To us\r\nin India, the human rights of all segments of society are\r\nsacrosanct and an article of faith rather than a policy.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nWe believe that international cooperation in the\r\nprotection and promotion of human rights should proceed\r\nwithin the framework of respect for the sovereignty and\r\nintegrity of States. We deplore the selective use of human\r\nrights issues as a form of political pressure, as an obstacle\r\nto trade or as a condition for development assistance. Such\r\nactions detract from the moral imperatives of human rights\r\npromotion and impede the full realization of the human\r\nrights of all people.\r\nHuman rights violations take many forms. Among the\r\nmost pernicious of them is terrorism. Terrorism seeks to\r\nexploit the openness and freedom offered by democratic\r\nsocieties to pursue narrow ends through the use of violence.\r\nIt must be combated by firm action at the national and\r\ninternational level. We are dismayed when we hear certain\r\nparties voice concern for the so-called rights of terrorists\r\nwhile ignoring their persistent violation of the human rights\r\nof their victims, including the right to life, freedom of\r\nexpression and the freedom to follow religious beliefs of\r\none’s own choice.\r\nIndia took the lead in raising the issue of terrorism as\r\na threat to human rights almost five years ago. We are\r\npleased that despite initial and sometimes vocal opposition\r\nby some western countries, terrorism is now accepted to be\r\nthe major threat to the enjoyment of human rights today. A\r\nnumber of international declarations have been issued on\r\nterrorism such as the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration, and the\r\nG-7 Lyons Declaration of 27 June 1996. We are\r\nencouraged that the international community now\r\nrecognizes terrorism as a major challenge to democracy,\r\nhuman rights and peace. In this context, India will pursue\r\nits call to adopt a binding international convention to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nFifty years after the United Nations was established,\r\nthe threat to humanity posed by nuclear weapons continues\r\nunabated. We believe that India’s security, as indeed that of\r\nall countries, lies in a nuclear-weapon-free world.\r\nThe only way to achieve this ultimate security is to\r\nban the production, possession and use of nuclear weapons\r\nwithin an agreed time-frame. Partial and half-hearted arms\r\ncontrol measures, such as the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) or the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), defeat\r\nthis objective by legitimizing the possession of nuclear\r\nweapons and permitting the non-explosive testing of nuclear\r\nweapons by nuclear-weapon countries. India, therefore,\r\ncannot be a party to such flawed arrangements.\r\nLet me also emphasize that any effective\r\ndisarmament regime needs to be universal in its approach\r\nand scope. The total elimination of all existing nuclear\r\nweapons, as an indispensable step towards general and\r\ncomplete disarmament under strict and efficient\r\ninternational control, is the demand of the entire Non-\r\nAligned Movement, to which we fully subscribe. Partial\r\nor regional approaches, as are sometimes put forward, do\r\nnot serve any useful purpose and can distract us from the\r\naccepted goal.\r\nAt the same time, India remains committed to\r\nparticipating fully and actively in any negotiations on a\r\ntreaty banning nuclear weapons and all types of tests, just\r\nas it did in regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nIndia signed and deposited its instrument of\r\nratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction two weeks\r\nago. India regrets that major chemical weapon producers\r\nhave been slow to ratify the Convention. We urge all\r\nthose countries which have still not done so to ratify the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention and to demonstrate their\r\nreadiness to move towards banning all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nIndia will work with all like-minded countries in\r\nsponsoring draft resolutions on the establishment of an ad\r\nhoc committee under the Conference on Disarmament for\r\nbeginning negotiations on a treaty banning nuclear\r\nweapons in a time-bound framework. India expects all\r\ncountries, including those represented in the Canberra\r\nCommission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons,\r\nwhich support time-bound elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons, to join in supporting such draft resolutions.\r\nIndia will once again present the draft convention on\r\nthe prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. India believes that the\r\nurgency of negotiating that convention has been greatly\r\nenhanced by the advisory opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice regarding the illegality of the use of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nAt the recent session of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, India joined 27 non-aligned and neutral\r\ncountries to present a phased programme for the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2020. India\r\nasks that all countries join us in propagating and\r\npromoting this joint proposal, both at the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly and in other forums.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nIndia is in favour of a non-discriminatory and\r\nuniversal ban on anti-personnel mines, which cripple or kill\r\na large number of civilians.\r\nThe continued credibility of the United Nations\r\nrequires reform of the Organization to reflect present-day\r\nrealities. While the membership of the United Nations has\r\nincreased greatly, the voices of the newly sovereign\r\ncountries in decision-making in the United Nations remain\r\nunheard. There is an imbalance in the authority and weight\r\nof structures and organs, just as there is an imbalance in the\r\nweight of different countries or groups. The General\r\nAssembly, the sole universal organ of the United Nations,\r\nneeds to find greater resonance in other bodies of the\r\nsystem.\r\nThe Security Council must be made more\r\nrepresentative in order to enhance its legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness. The vast increase in the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations since its founding, especially of the\r\ndeveloping countries, must find adequate representation in\r\nthe categories of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership. A comprehensive proposal by the Non-\r\nAligned Movement for the reform and restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council is already on the table. India supports the\r\nexpansion of both the permanent and the non-permanent\r\ncategories. We are against piecemeal or temporary solutions\r\nwhich discriminate against developing countries. We\r\nbelieve that the same yardstick must be applied to all\r\ncountries, developed or developing, from all regions or\r\ngroups, for induction as permanent members. We believe\r\nthat under any objectively derived criteria for the expansion\r\nof permanent members, India would be an obvious\r\ncandidate.\r\nReform and expansion must be an integral part of a\r\ncommon package. The restructuring of the Security Council\r\nmust give expression to the impulse for reform. The\r\nreforms must address not only the failings of the past, but\r\nalso the needs of the future.\r\nPeacekeeping is a significant area of United Nations\r\nactivities, very often the most visible symbol of the\r\nOrganization’s presence on the ground. India has\r\nparticipated in over 25 peacekeeping operations on four\r\ncontinents, including some of the most sensitive and\r\nprolonged, starting with Korea in 1953 and 1954, and\r\nincluding the operations in Viet Nam, Congo, the Middle\r\nEast, Cambodia, Haiti, Somalia, El Salvador, Mozambique\r\nand Rwanda. Indian peacekeepers are currently in the field\r\nin Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Liberia and Kuwait.\r\nOur participation has not been without cost. We have lost\r\n100 peacekeepers for the United Nations cause. We have\r\nalso offered a fully-equipped brigade to the United\r\nNations standby arrangement. The performance of the\r\nIndian troops has won universal recognition. India is one\r\nof the few countries which can sustain large-scale troop\r\ncommitment over prolonged periods.\r\nOur participation in United Nations peacekeeping\r\ndoes not stem from considerations of narrow gain. We\r\nhave participated because we have been wanted and\r\nbecause we have been asked, but most of all because of\r\nour solidarity and empathy with the affected countries and\r\nwith the international community, as well as because of\r\nour commitment to the United Nations and to the cause\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nIndia has offered its candidature for the non-\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council from Asia for\r\n1997 and 1998. Our candidature is rooted in the criteria\r\nstipulated in the Charter: the principle of equity, our\r\nunwavering commitment to the United Nations, and to the\r\ncause of multilateralism, and our 50-year-long\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and to the other purposes and principles of the\r\nOrganization. India has a unique record of supporting\r\nUnited Nations activities against apartheid and\r\ncolonialism. We have richly contributed to the debates on\r\ndevelopment, disarmament and human rights. We seek the\r\nonerous responsibility of Council membership convinced\r\nof the support of this Assembly.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay a warm\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, for his successful stewardship during a most\r\ndifficult period. His services are a distinct asset to this\r\nworld body.\r\nLet me briefly refer to India’s interaction with the\r\nworld. We have witnessed some remarkable changes in\r\nthe last few years. New vistas for greater cooperation are\r\nnow visible. The challenge lies in effectively seizing the\r\nopportunities. We attach the highest importance to\r\ndeveloping cordial and friendly relations with our\r\nneighbours with a view to promoting peace, stability and\r\nmutual confidence in the region. We also seek to develop\r\nstronger economic and commercial relations within the\r\nregion, for all-around prosperity. As current Chairman of\r\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\r\n(SAARC), it will be our endeavour to promote\r\nmultifaceted cooperation in all spheres.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nThe economic reforms embarked upon since 1991\r\nhave provided India with a new outward orientation that\r\nseeks greater integration of India into the global\r\nmarketplace. Today, India is branching out and adding to\r\nthe substantive content of its relations with individual\r\ncountries of the region and beyond, developing and building\r\nupon regional cooperation arrangements involving SAARC,\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the\r\nASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council (APEC) and the Indian Ocean Rim, to\r\nname a few.\r\nConvinced of the need and utility of enhanced South-\r\nSouth cooperation, we accord the highest priority to our\r\nrelations with Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. We\r\nare proud to have been associated with Africa and its\r\ncauses in the United Nations since the inception of the\r\nworld body. We appreciate the role played by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which has striven to\r\nfind regional solutions to African problems. Its efforts must\r\nbe supplemented by the United Nations. The scramble for\r\nAfrica in the nineteenth century was for African land and\r\nresources. We hope that the closing years of the present\r\ncentury will see a scramble to redress African problems, the\r\ngenesis of which largely lies outside the region. The United\r\nNations must lead international efforts to meet Africa’s\r\nneeds and aspirations.\r\nWe are deeply concerned at the recent serious\r\nincidents of violence in the West Bank and Gaza and by\r\nIsraeli authorities’ opening of a tunnel beneath Haram\r\nAl-Sharif — the Temple Mount — in East Jerusalem,\r\nwhich resulted in the tragic loss of several innocent lives\r\nand large-scale injuries following violent clashes. The\r\ncurrent situation underlines the need for immediate and\r\neffective measures to end the violence and to create a\r\nclimate that would enable purposeful negotiations based on\r\na recognition of the underlying causes of the conflict. These\r\ndevelopments also serve to emphasize the need to build\r\nfurther on the agreements and understandings already\r\nreached.\r\nIn the wave of the recent political changes in the\r\nMiddle East, India is encouraged by the reiteration by all\r\nparties of their continued commitment to the Middle East\r\npeace process based on the framework established by the\r\nMadrid Conference. However, we are concerned that these\r\nreaffirmations do not appear to have manifested themselves\r\nin commensurate progress in the peace process. India urges\r\nall parties to intensify their efforts towards realizing the\r\nmutually agreed objectives of the Middle East peace\r\nprocess, keeping in view that achieving durable peace and\r\nstability in the Middle East requires solving the\r\nPalestinian issue.\r\nIndia has ties dating back to early history with\r\nAfghanistan, a country with which we also share bonds of\r\nkinship, culture and religion. We are deeply saddened by\r\nthe continued violence and loss of life in that country.\r\nIndia stands for the unity, independence and territorial\r\nintegrity of Afghanistan. We urge all Afghan parties to\r\nresolve their differences through early peaceful dialogue\r\nand negotiations. We support the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his special representative to bring about a\r\nsolution in Afghanistan.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement figures firmly in\r\nIndia’s world view and constitutes an important plank in\r\nour foreign policy. We remain firmly committed to the\r\nphilosophy and values of the Non-Aligned Movement. For\r\nus, non-alignment means independence of thought and\r\nautonomy of choice. It also means working in cooperation\r\nwith the largest number of countries. Last year’s non-\r\naligned summit in Colombia reinforced our faith in the\r\nability and resilience of the Movement, its responsiveness\r\nto change and its effectiveness in today’s global situation.\r\nIndia will be privileged to host the next ministerial\r\nconference of the non-aligned countries in New Delhi in\r\n1997.\r\nIndia is a progressive country charting a balanced\r\ncourse between economic growth and social justice, and\r\nscience and tradition. It is committed to the values of\r\npeace, non-violence, coexistence, pluralism, tolerance and\r\nconstructive cooperation. Culturally, India is a bridge\r\nbetween traditional cultures and emergent trends.\r\nPolitically, India will remain anchored in a pluralistic,\r\nliberal democracy that can provide space for all its\r\nconstituents and internal interlocutors.\r\nBefore I conclude, I am reminded of an ancient Rig\r\nVedic hymn which reads:\r\n“O citizens of the world!\r\nLive in harmony and concord\r\nBe organized and cooperative\r\nSpeak with one voice\r\nAnd make your resolutions with one Mind.”\r\nMay this invocation to harmony, cooperation,\r\nconsensus and solidarity continue to guide our\r\ndeliberations and actions.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nAddress by The Honourable Denzil L. Douglas, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for National Security, Foreign\r\nAffairs, Finance, Planning and Information of Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\na statement by the Prime Minister and Minister for National\r\nSecurity, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Planning and\r\nInformation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nThe Honourable Denzil L. Douglas, Prime\r\nMinister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister and Minister for National\r\nSecurity, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Planning and\r\nInformation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, His Excellency\r\nMr. Denzil Douglas, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Douglas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I should like to\r\nbegin my presentation by congratulating Mr. Razali Ismail\r\non his election to the presidency of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. It bears testimony to this Organization’s\r\nconfidence in and high regard for his skills and abilities.\r\nAlso, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Freitas do\r\nAmaral for the efficient manner in which he presided over\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary session of the United Nations.\r\nAt last year’s session, I spoke of the faith of the\r\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the United Nations\r\nas the only global Organization able to balance the interests\r\nof the weak against those of the strong. I spoke also of the\r\nneed for individual countries to work to develop approaches\r\nto collective problem-solving and partnership. Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis reiterates this faith, which, I believe, is amply\r\njustified.\r\nVery recently the United Nations came to the\r\nassistance of my country and made available support and\r\nresources to aid the process of constitutional reform, which,\r\nhopefully, will avert further fragmentation and preserve the\r\nintegrity of Saint Kitts and Nevis. I should like sincerely to\r\nrecord my thanks to the Secretary-General for this kind\r\ngesture.\r\nI said previously that my Government does not ask for\r\nhand-outs. We do not expect charity. Our participation in\r\nthis forum is the result of our commitment to\r\nmultilateralism. All we ask for is genuine partnership,\r\nopportunity and an environment in which we all can\r\nprosper.\r\nMy party, while in opposition, developed an action\r\nplan for the progressive growth of the people of Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis. Today, as the duly elected Government,\r\nwe have readily realized that the problems facing small\r\ndeveloping States keep increasing. But this has not\r\ndiminished our resolve. One year ago, my Government\r\nbegan the difficult and trying task of implementing our\r\npolicies and devising new strategies to address the\r\nstubborn problems facing my country. We recognize that\r\nthe coexistence in any society of the threat of narco-\r\ntrafficking, youth unemployment and poverty is a recipe\r\nfor social chaos. We in Saint Kitts and Nevis are\r\ntherefore committed to ensuring that the young people\r\ninherit a legacy of hope and live in an environment in\r\nwhich dreams are not only kept alive but are realized.\r\nWe fully appreciate that the challenges ahead are\r\ngreat, but we also see great possibilities, and we are\r\ndetermined to embrace the opportunities. However, to\r\nmove our people forward we will require partnership; we\r\ncannot do it alone.\r\nTo this end, I welcome with enthusiasm the\r\nstatement last week by the Secretary of State for Foreign\r\nand Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom. I am\r\nencouraged by his intervention because it speaks to the\r\nfundamental issues that we in small States have for so\r\nlong worked to bring to the top of the international\r\nagenda.\r\nLast year I appealed to Member States to commit to\r\na genuine partnership between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping worlds. The developing world — small States\r\nin particular — have for far too long been languishing on\r\nthe periphery of international affairs and are often\r\ncorralled into the mainstream only when issues of votes\r\nor candidatures are at the centre of debates and individual\r\nnational policies.\r\nThe Secretary of State for Foreign and\r\nCommonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom spoke of\r\nthe need for the developed world to pursue policies that\r\nwill allow the economies of developing countries to\r\nexpand through export-led growth and the abolition of\r\nbarriers to trade in the developed world. I fully support\r\nthis call. My delegation would like to see the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions come to the aid of small States by\r\ncreating adequate structures to allow these States to\r\ndevelop economically and participate better in the world\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nsystem. There must be a period of transition to encourage\r\nsmall States to integrate into the mainstream of\r\ninternational interaction.\r\nWe all share a common responsibility to ensure that\r\ndeveloping countries are more equitably integrated into the\r\nworld economic system. We must break the insidious cycle\r\nof dependency and replace it with bonds of partnership and\r\ncooperation. We are our brothers’ keepers. This must be\r\ngiven priority in our national and international policies.\r\nThe developed world must avoid outmoded\r\nperceptions that suggest that it is best qualified to prescribe\r\nstrategies for growth in developing countries. Attention will\r\nalso have to be paid to indigenous priorities in developing\r\ncountries. I say to the Assembly that there can be no\r\nprescription without consultation. Attempts at development\r\nwithout recognizing the peculiar problems of small States\r\nand the responsibilities of the developed world will not\r\npromote sustainable growth.\r\nWe speak repeatedly of hope, and the promise of the\r\nnew millennium, yet sometimes overlook many of the\r\nproblems plaguing us today. My Government looks to this\r\nnew era with great optimism and unbridled hope that we\r\ncan achieve sustainable development, that sustainable\r\nhuman growth can be realized, and that our people can\r\nafford to dream of a life beyond the expectations of their\r\nforebears.\r\nHowever, I fear for our children’s dreams in a world\r\nwhere the products of developing countries are\r\ndiscriminated against and dubious tariffs make our goods\r\nseem uncompetitive. I see definite cause for concern when\r\nfriendly countries that are fully cognizant of the need for\r\nthe limited preferential access our region enjoys, pursue\r\npolicies inimical to the development and growth of our\r\ncountries. This strategy is not free trade. I fear for the\r\nprogress of my people when development is measured in\r\ncold statistical terms that ignore social transformation and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nI fear for the future of my children if small, vulnerable\r\nStates such as my own are continuously graduated out of\r\naid-recipient-country status simply because the gross\r\nnational product per capita is considered high. This policy\r\ndoes not take into account our high per capita cost of\r\ninfrastructure development; it does not take into account the\r\nfrequency of hurricanes and other natural disasters, or the\r\ndiseconomy of scale faced by our small enterprises.\r\nI fear for my brothers and sisters in the Windward\r\nIslands, whose very livelihood is threatened and could be\r\nseriously undermined by the disputes over Windward\r\nIsland banana exports. If the economies of the Windward\r\nIslands are affected, my country, too, will suffer. Our\r\neconomies are very closely linked. We share a common\r\ncurrency, a common central bank and, of course, a\r\ncommon future.\r\nIt seems that the international community would\r\nreadily punish growth. Whenever small States experience\r\nrelative growth, instead of lending further assistance to\r\nensure that they emerge from the quagmire of deepening\r\npoverty, necessary resources and support systems are\r\ntaken away, and these countries find themselves being\r\ngraduated out of concessional assistance programmes.\r\nThis is wrong. This is inhumane. When we rob a man of\r\nthe means to feed and educate himself and his family,\r\nhow can we expect him to contribute productively to civil\r\nsociety? This is a world of people, and its organization\r\nmust be about people. Their needs should not become\r\nsecondary to systems, policies and experiments. Structures\r\nshould be used to further the goals and aspirations of our\r\npeoples despite differences in economies, populations and\r\nsize. Our peoples all share a common dream: the dream\r\nof freedom to chart their own destinies; the dream of self-\r\nreliance; the dream of a better standard of living.\r\nOn the question of the environment, it is\r\ninconceivable that the very countries that agree to\r\ncontribute to coastal erosion management and fund studies\r\non environmental protection would wish to trans-ship\r\nhazardous toxic waste through our waterways. The\r\nfragility of my region’s ecosystems, the openness of the\r\neconomies, the overwhelming reliance on food imports,\r\nand the susceptibility of the tourism product put us\r\nprecariously, and, perhaps, uniquely, at the mercy of\r\nexternal forces.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis intends to preserve the\r\nstandard of living we have achieved and to ensure a\r\nprosperous future for all of our peoples. My Government\r\nstrongly urges the international community to respect our\r\ndetermination to make the Caribbean a nuclear-free zone\r\nand to keep it free from toxic pollutants. The region\r\nalready suffers from the consequences of rising sea levels,\r\ncoastal erosion and the destructive effects of natural\r\ndisasters. The catalogue is very long; we cannot add\r\nfurther problems to it.\r\nSmall island developing States require committed,\r\nlong-term assistance in environmental protection. I am\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nconvinced that sustainable development and environmental\r\npreservation are inexorably linked. We cannot make token\r\ngestures of support on one level only to undermine support\r\non another. We need to enforce existing international\r\ninstruments, promote cooperation and allow the United\r\nNations to play a more central and coordinating role in\r\ndeveloping appropriate machinery for bringing together\r\npolitical will and financial and technological resources to\r\nguarantee results.\r\nI call on the United Nations to devise a comprehensive\r\nand integrated approach to addressing sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Additionally, I urge developing countries to\r\nwork more closely together to develop indigenous strategies\r\nand innovative approaches in order to solve the problems of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe plethora of issues which come before the United\r\nNations are critical. Therefore, it is necessary that the\r\nUnited Nations undergo substantive reform that will address\r\nresource distribution and the implementation of\r\nrecommendations. We must be careful not to address\r\nreform in a superficial way. We have to commit ourselves\r\nto reforms which allow the Organization to respond more\r\neffectively to the problems which face Member States.\r\nIt is our collective responsibility to restore and\r\nstrengthen the international agenda of the United Nations\r\nand support its role and performance in the social,\r\ninstitutional and economic fields. I believe that the\r\nOrganization can help to fuse our individual and collective\r\ngoals. However, Member countries must believe in the\r\ninternational relevance of this Organization.\r\nIt is important for us to promote consensus in\r\naddressing the important questions of budgetary and\r\nadministrative reform of this, our Organization.\r\nIrrespective of national ambitions, irrespective of size\r\nor resources, the United Nations is the only global\r\ninstitution whose membership gives it the mandate to\r\nexamine the vast array of problems that affect the entire\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nThe work being undertaken to reform the United\r\nNations should be structured in such a way as to eliminate\r\nunnecessary wastage and bureaucratic inefficiency. At the\r\nsame time, we should not use the problems as an excuse to\r\ndiminish our commitment to the strengthening and re-\r\nenergizing of the United Nations.\r\nWhen we look at international affairs, democracy is\r\nstill one of our most sacred aspirations. But it needs\r\ntangible institutional and infrastructural support. My\r\nGovernment welcomes the extension of the United\r\nNations mission in Haiti which we believe is crucial to\r\nconsolidating and furthering the cause of democracy and\r\nhuman resource development in Haiti. We should not\r\nexpect to strengthen democracy in Haiti without\r\naddressing the systemic causes of poverty, illiteracy and\r\nviolence and the absence of democratic institutions. The\r\npeople of Haiti will eventually inherit the rewards of\r\npeace when commitment to long-term social, political and\r\neconomic development is assured. It is unwise for States\r\nto use politics and partisanship to impede progress in\r\nHaiti. Its people long for an opportunity to become\r\nmasters of their own fate, and they should be given that\r\nchance to pursue their national aspirations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the prospects for peace in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the progress towards\r\nimplementing the recommendations of the Dayton\r\nAccords. We welcome the willingness of the parties to\r\ndevelop democratic institutions, enhance human rights and\r\nsee to the return and settlement of displaced persons. The\r\nsituation in this region is still quite fragile. We must\r\ncontinue to struggle for peace, and people must be made\r\nto believe that such atrocities will never, ever happen\r\nagain.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East has regrettably\r\ntaken a turn for the worse. I appeal to the region’s\r\nGovernments to recommit themselves to peace, the only\r\nviable option for attaining coexistence, security, stability\r\nand genuine progress for all parties concerned. We further\r\nurge the Governments to continue to respect the\r\nagreements reached and to commit to their\r\nimplementation. The successes of past years should never\r\nbe squandered.\r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis lends its\r\nsupport to the work of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor Rwanda and commends the work of the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity in\r\nattempting to resolve these challenging and often thorny\r\nissues. We also urge all factions in Burundi to give\r\nnegotiations a fighting chance. Violence breeds violence,\r\nbut peace gives birth to partnership. Peace gives birth to\r\ngrowth and to economic development.\r\nWe have circulated a document which reflects our\r\npolicy regarding Taiwan. Our policy is to respect the\r\nterritorial integrity of all countries and to refrain from\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of all Member States.\r\nBecause of our traditional relationship with the 21.3 million\r\npeople on Taiwan, we have come to respect their economic\r\nstability and progress. Their growing democracy and their\r\ncontribution to the developing world have not gone\r\nunnoticed.\r\nWe believe they have an important and continuing role\r\nto play in international development strategies. We are\r\nconfident that whatever difficulties exist between the\r\nChinese people separated by the Taiwan Strait can be\r\nresolved by the Chinese people themselves and in a spirit\r\nof fraternity and good will. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to be ready, if necessary, to provide the\r\nmechanisms to facilitate dialogue and cooperation.\r\nResolution of the stalemate would significantly contribute\r\nto the cause of development worldwide and to peace and\r\nsecurity in the region.\r\nWe look forward to the implementation of the\r\nPlatform for Action adopted at the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing. My Government believes\r\nthat this is a significant step and a triumph for all women\r\nworldwide. It will allow them to achieve full equality of\r\nopportunity and equitable integration into the mainstream of\r\ndecision-making and the development process.\r\nWe should bear in mind when discussing the question\r\nof human rights that we commit a fundamental error by\r\nselectively disregarding the right to economic survival and\r\nsocial well-being. When we single out human rights and\r\nfreedom we do grave injustice to those people languishing\r\nbelow the poverty line, unable to determine the course of\r\ntheir own lives.\r\nFundamental to achieving tangible results is the\r\nnecessity of adopting a comprehensive and wholesome\r\napproach to human rights. It is not nearly enough to ensure\r\npolitical suffrage and freedom of expression, although these\r\nare extremely important, without establishing mechanisms\r\nto foster social self-reliance and economic independence.\r\nTo promote human rights in the wider sense is to\r\ncomplement and consolidate a democratic culture within\r\nany given society.\r\nHuman rights protection also means protecting the\r\nrights of children against hunger, against mental and\r\nphysical abuse, against prostitution, against trafficking in\r\nchildren and against pornography. Therefore, we must\r\nattack the ills of poverty, illiteracy and deprivation and\r\nenact punitive legislation. We support the first international\r\nconference on the sexual exploitation of minors, held in\r\nStockholm, as a significant step and an important\r\ninitiative to raise awareness and develop strategies.\r\nIn conclusion, I challenge the international\r\ncommunity to give effect to promises with solutions and\r\ntangible results. If we fail to design appropriate strategies\r\ntoday to address present problems, we are doomed to\r\nrepeat past mistakes.\r\nThe time for action is overdue. Please, we can wait\r\nno longer and we must delay no longer.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for National Security, Foreign Affairs, Finance,\r\nPlanning and Information of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Denzil L. Douglas, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for National Security, Foreign Affairs,\r\nFinance, Planning and Information of Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Kazakstan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kassymjomart Tokaev.\r\nMr. Tokaev (Kazakstan): I wish to congratulate the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session\r\non his election to his high office. I would like to express\r\nmy confidence that he will accomplish his important\r\nmission honourably.\r\nThere is no doubt that the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will go down in the history of mankind\r\nas an important milestone on the world community’s road\r\nto global peace and security. One of the most important\r\ndiplomatic documents of our century, the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, has been opened for signing.\r\nOn that occasion the President of Kazakstan,\r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, made a special statement,\r\nwhich has been circulated as an official United Nations\r\ndocument. The people of Kazakstan, having fully\r\nexperienced the destructive power of nuclear weapons,\r\nresolutely voted to end the testing of these lethal\r\nweapons. In 1991 the President of Kazakstan, expressing\r\nthe wish of his people, made a decision to shut down the\r\nSemipalatinsk nuclear test site. Thus, Kazakstan had\r\nalready taken decisive measures to ban nuclear testing\r\nfive years ago.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nKazakstan is consistent in its policy of non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Recently, we completed\r\nthe dismantling of the nuclear infrastructure on the territory\r\nof Kazakstan, thereby eliminating the capability that was,\r\nuntil recently, the fourth largest in the world.\r\nThat is why, when giving their due to all the countries\r\nwhich have trod the thorny path of preparing this Treaty, I\r\nbelieve it is necessary to recognize my country’s significant\r\ncontribution to this extremely important cause.\r\nHowever, considerable progress in disarmament does\r\nnot, regrettably, guarantee the stability of the present world\r\norder. We still witness some negative impulses destroying\r\nthe basis of the relationship between the States which\r\nunited more than half a century ago. We have to admit that\r\nwith the disappearance of a bipolar world, our planet has\r\nnot become safer. On the contrary, the potential for global\r\nconflict has increased considerably increased. That is why\r\nthe issue of reforming the United Nations, so that our\r\ncommon Organization can adequately respond to conflicting\r\nrealities of international relations at this juncture, is\r\nbecoming ever so urgent.\r\nReforms are an indispensable element of any system’s\r\ndevelopment. They are even more important in the case of\r\nsuch a universal forum as the United Nations. In his speech\r\nat the Special Commemorative Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly, the President of Kazakstan underscored the\r\nimportant need to increase the world community’s efforts\r\nto elaborate a conceptual model of a renewed United\r\nNations. It involves new objectives, tasks and functions of\r\nthe United Nations of the next century.\r\nThe United Nations, being a genuinely universal\r\nOrganization, requires a special approach. It is important to\r\nkeep in mind that the United Nations is our common home.\r\nWe cannot count on hotels in case of emergency. That is\r\nwhy United Nations reforms should be approached from\r\nrational positions. We want the United Nations to keep up\r\nwith the times and to tap the potential for self-improvement\r\nand elimination of the vestiges of the past. We want the\r\nUnited Nations structure to be more effective and flexible\r\nin dealing with the problems threatening peace and security.\r\nSupporting the desire of Japan and Germany to become\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, Kazakstan is\r\nin favour of an expansion of the Council’s non-permanent\r\nmembership on the basis of an equitable and balanced\r\nrepresentation of all regions. All other proposals should also\r\nbe taken into consideration.\r\nCriticism of the United Nations can hardly be a\r\nreason for doubting its ability to function and for shifting\r\nall the blame onto the Secretary-General. I am sure that\r\nwe have not yet fully mobilized the creative potential of\r\nthe United Nations. This applies first of all to the Charter.\r\nWe should carefully reread it, taking into consideration\r\ntoday’s world order, not to drastically revise, it but to find\r\nadditional opportunities hidden in this truly\r\ncomprehensive document. It is our opinion that despite\r\nthe piles of studies on the legal framework of the United\r\nNations, the Charter itself contains enormous unexplored\r\npotential for the renewal of the United Nations. Until the\r\nUnited Nations mobilizes these dormant capabilities it\r\nwill create the impression of a dormant Organization\r\nunable to respond to the challenges of today.\r\nWe have to take a closer look at those provisions of\r\nthe Charter that deal with cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, or, speaking the\r\nlanguage of the Charter, with regional arrangements and\r\nagencies. This kind of interaction would be extremely\r\neffective for the development of an early warning system\r\nand preventive diplomacy. Besides, active cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations would be beneficial when\r\ndealing with economic problems.\r\nI would like to recall President Nursultan\r\nNazarbaev’s proposal to include in the agenda of a future\r\nsession of the General Assembly an item entitled “United\r\nNations reforms — an adequate response to the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century”.\r\nOne does not have to elaborate on the need to ensure\r\nstability and security in the Central Asia region.\r\nKazakstan, as a strategically important State in this\r\nregion, makes every effort to guarantee tranquillity in\r\nCentral Asia.\r\nHowever, the situation in the region defies\r\nstraightforward assessment. There are zones of\r\ntranquillity, including Kazakstan, but there are also zones\r\nof conflict. One matter of great concern is the situation in\r\nAfghanistan. Further escalation of the conflict in\r\nAfghanistan could have negative effects on the situation\r\nin Central Asia. We are grateful to the Security Council\r\nfor paying attention to the situation in that country. There\r\nis no doubt that the Security Council statement of 28\r\nSeptember 1996 is important for the resolution of the\r\nsituation there. At the same time, we urge the Security\r\nCouncil to take up this item again in order to elaborate\r\nmeasures to stop the conflict.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nThe situation in Central Asia underscores the need for\r\ngreater interaction between the region and the United\r\nNations. Such interaction would cause Central Asia to\r\nbecome more involved in international cooperation. Central\r\nAsia could undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of\r\na safer world order.\r\nIn this regard, we pin great hopes on the establishment\r\nby the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe (ECE) of a joint commission for\r\nCentral Asia. We appreciate the positive United Nations\r\nreaction to this initiative of our Head of State.\r\nKazakstan wants to join the World Trade Organization\r\nas soon as possible and is taking concrete steps in this\r\ndirection.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for its support\r\nof Kazakstan’s proposal concerning the resolution on transit\r\nenvironment in the landlocked States of Central Asia.\r\nWe are also pleased at the positive reaction of the\r\nUnited Nations to the initiative of the leaders of the three\r\nCentral Asian States concerning the formation of a Central\r\nAsian peacekeeping battalion. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to state that the Central Asian peacekeeping\r\nbattalion will be committed to the United Nations Charter\r\nand will serve the ideals and purposes of our Organization.\r\nFour years ago, speaking at the United Nations, the\r\nPresident of Kazakstan pointed out the necessity of\r\nconvening a conference on interaction and confidence-\r\nbuilding measures in Asia. It is with deep satisfaction that\r\nwe can report that our quest for peace and security on the\r\nAsian continent is being supported by an ever increasing\r\nnumber of States. Experts are at work on a permanent\r\nbasis. A conference on Asian security took place at the\r\nlevel of Deputy Foreign Ministers. We are especially\r\ngrateful to the United Nations for its assistance in the\r\nimplementation of the initiative of our Head of State.\r\nKazakstan regards the convocation of this conference on\r\ninteraction and confidence-building measures in Asia as its\r\ncontribution to United Nations global peacekeeping efforts.\r\nKazakstan fully supports the peace-making activities\r\nof the United Nations in different parts of the world. We\r\nhave no doubt that the United Nations should play a\r\npriority role in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Our common task is to prevent United Nations\r\npeace-making functions from being delegated to any other\r\norganizations. The diminished peace-making potential of\r\nthe United Nations is not its fault, but its misfortune.\r\nKazakstan believes that United Nations peace-\r\nmaking activities could be rendered more effective\r\nthrough a more precise formulation and strengthening of\r\nthe missions’ mandates. They could thereby make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the resolution of crisis\r\nsituations.\r\nWhen we talk about international issues we cannot\r\nignore a trend as alarming as the growth of secessionism.\r\nThis phenomenon has become one of the major causes of\r\ncrisis situations in the world, particularly in the post-\r\nSoviet context. We think that the United Nations must\r\npay close attention to the destructive consequences of\r\naggressive secessionism. The time has come to put an end\r\nto the absolute right of nations to self-determination.\r\nBasically, the world has already realized the right to self-\r\ndetermination; further continuation of this process will\r\ncreate new trouble spots and lead to more bloodshed. The\r\ncurrent world order should rest on the principles of the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States. If we really\r\ncare about the stability of the current world order we\r\nmust firmly reject any manifestation of secessionism. Our\r\nhighest values should be the peace, well-being and\r\nhappiness of peoples, and we can achieve these goals not\r\nby instigating peoples to self-determination but by\r\ncreating appropriate conditions for the sustainable\r\neconomic development of all nations.\r\nFrom this lofty rostrum it is impossible to ignore\r\nanother problem that brings great pain to humankind, a\r\npain which our country feels especially acutely. I am\r\nreferring to environmental disasters. There may be no\r\nother place in the world where such vast territories are\r\naffected by the consequences of these disasters. Indeed,\r\nmore than half of Kazakstan’s territory could be declared\r\nan environmental disaster area. However, it is not only a\r\nmatter of territories, but people who are still suffering.\r\nThe Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and the Aral Sea have\r\nbecome disaster areas of global dimensions. Furthermore,\r\nwe should not forget that Kazakstan has been the site of\r\nchemical and biological weapons tests.\r\nAll these problems require priority attention from the\r\nUnited Nations. During economic transition, even large\r\nStates cannot cope alone with environmental problems of\r\nsuch magnitude. It is also important to remember that it\r\nis innocent people who suffer, not the ones who created\r\nor tested these lethal weapons. They are the victims of the\r\narms race between the two opposing systems, victims of\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nthe totalitarian thinking of the cold war period. They have\r\nevery right to demand the attention of international\r\norganizations and donor countries.\r\nWe cannot say that the United Nations has been\r\nindifferent to the consequences of the environmental\r\ndisasters in Kazakstan. But, at the same time, we cannot\r\nclaim that the victims of these environmental disasters have\r\nfelt practical results of the activities of international\r\nmissions. We are grateful to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank for the\r\nelaboration of large-scale programmes for the rehabilitation\r\nof the Aral Sea zone. At the same time, we are looking\r\nforward to a more active execution of these programmes.\r\nMeanwhile, the situation in this region, as well as in other\r\nenvironmental disaster areas, remains extremely serious.\r\nKazakstan welcomes and supports the resolution of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly to convene a special\r\nsession on environment and sustainable development in the\r\nmiddle of next year. We hope that this forum will adopt\r\nmeaningful decisions on environmental problems that also\r\naffect our country.\r\nThis century, which has witnessed two world wars, the\r\ncollapse of the colonial system and the disintegration of the\r\nsocialist system, has begun a new phase. This phase has\r\nnew dimensions, both geo-political and geo-economic.\r\nIn politics, a trend towards the globalization of\r\ninternational problems has been apparent. With the end of\r\nthe cold war, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation have\r\nnot been solved. The problem of environmental security has\r\nacquired global dimensions. The globalization of\r\ncommunications has triggered illegal trafficking in weapons,\r\ndrugs and money of giant proportions. A new information\r\nrealm has been formed in which national borders have\r\nbecome merely symbolic.\r\nPreviously unknown methods of production have\r\nemerged, increasingly referred to as “computer civilization”.\r\nScientific research and technological factors have grown in\r\nimportance as never before. New technologies have become\r\nthe hottest items in world markets. The role of a State in\r\nworld economic ties is changing; it is no longer the\r\ndominant institute. International institutes function as\r\nindependent international economic entities.\r\nIt is with this list of problems, which is far from being\r\ncomplete, that we are entering the next century. We have\r\nyet to sort them out and find optimal ways to adapt to new\r\nrealities which will be facing us in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We have to admit that humankind, creating these\r\nproblems through its activities, still cannot find adequate\r\nways to solve them.\r\nThat is why we turn to the United Nations. Our\r\ncommon home is becoming a quintessence of the human\r\nmind. We have to help the United Nations reach a new\r\nlevel in dealing with global trends. A renewed\r\nOrganization, promptly reacting to the challenges of\r\ntoday, will not only enrich itself but will also give us a\r\nsense of confidence on the eve of the next century.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Lieutenant-General Mompati S. Merafhe,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Botswana.\r\nMr. Merafhe (Botswana): I am delighted to extend\r\nto the President and his country, Malaysia, the sincere\r\ncongratulations of the Government and the people of\r\nBotswana on his assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. His record as\r\nan accomplished diplomat has the admiration of my\r\ndelegation. He can therefore count on the full support and\r\ncooperation of the delegation of Botswana in the\r\ndischarge of his demanding responsibilities.\r\nWe salute his predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his successful\r\nstewardship of the fiftieth session and the Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting.\r\nThe last five years have been the most momentous\r\nin the history of the United Nations, imposing on the\r\nworld body enormous responsibilities, which the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, and the Secretariat have carried out with a deep\r\nsense of commitment and dedication. We assure them that\r\nthey continue to enjoy the confidence and full support of\r\nBotswana in the execution of their duties.\r\nThe African continent continues to make\r\ncommendable progress in the consolidation of freedom\r\nand democracy. This year the continent witnessed the\r\nsuccessful holding of multi-party elections in Benin,\r\nSierra Leone and the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nThe right of citizens to organize themselves and\r\nparticipate freely in the political processes of their\r\ncountries, and respect for human rights, form the basis for\r\nstability, democracy and development.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nIndeed, the continent has increasingly embraced these\r\nuniversal values, which are an integral part of a democratic\r\nculture. Not only has Africa embraced political pluralism,\r\naccountability and good governance, it has also\r\ndemonstrated its readiness to defend these principles.\r\nA year ago we expected that the people of Angola\r\nwould by now have started a new chapter of peace in the\r\nhistory of their country. It is regrettable that to date the way\r\nforward remains unclear. We strongly call upon those who\r\nhave contributed to the current stalemate in Angola to see\r\nreason and show more commitment to the peace process.\r\nTwo days ago the Heads of State and Government of\r\nsouthern Africa met in Luanda, Angola, in an effort to\r\npersuade all concerned to ensure the speedy implementation\r\nof the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the situation in\r\nBurundi. The country is wallowing in a quagmire of self-\r\ndestruction. No amount of reasoning and persuasion has\r\nthus far succeeded in drawing the political leaders in\r\nBurundi away from a path of mutual annihilation and to the\r\npath of accommodation and reconciliation.\r\nWe salute the efforts of the regional leaders and of the\r\ninternational community aimed at ensuring the restoration\r\nof democracy and constitutional order in Burundi. That\r\nsister country deserves some reprieve from the traumatic\r\nexperience it has recently gone through. Burundi needs\r\npeace and stability now, not tomorrow.\r\nWhile the situation in Rwanda remains tense, there are\r\nsome encouraging signs that the country is making steady\r\nprogress towards normalcy. Preparations for next year’s\r\ngeneral elections seem to be well under way.\r\nWe urge the international community to spare no\r\neffort in encouraging that country towards national\r\nreconciliation. Key among the necessary measures to be\r\nundertaken is the safe return of refugees to their homeland.\r\nDespite all efforts by the international community, and\r\nby West Africa in particular, the political crisis in Liberia\r\nhas so far eluded solution. We call upon all the parties\r\nconcerned to ensure that elections are held in May 1997 as\r\nscheduled.\r\nIn our view, and in reality, Western Sahara poses a\r\nmajor political and moral problem. Botswana is committed\r\nto the holding of a free, fair and impartial referendum for\r\nthe people of Western Sahara, in accordance with the\r\nSettlement Plan. We are deeply concerned that the\r\nidentification process has been in a state of paralysis for\r\nseveral months now.\r\nSomalia continues to haunt the conscience of the\r\nworld. The situation in that country is a tragic\r\ndemonstration of how a disparate assortment of gunmen\r\ncan hijack and destroy a nation. The United Nations\r\nshould not consider Somalia a lost cause. We should\r\ntherefore persevere in the search for a comprehensive\r\nsettlement to the political crisis in that country.\r\nRecent developments in the Middle East are a matter\r\nof profound concern to Botswana. Starting in September\r\n1993 we were pleased to witness the dramatic unfolding\r\nof a promising peace process between Israel and the\r\nPalestinians, on the one hand, and between Israel and\r\nJordan, on the other. We looked forward to the\r\nresumption of negotiations between Israel and its Arab\r\nneighbours, Syria and Lebanon, which, hopefully, would\r\nhave ushered in a lasting solution to the conflict in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nRecent events in the occupied Arab territories are a\r\nstark indicator of what can happen to the peace process if\r\nthings are allowed to drag on and on. We appeal to the\r\nGovernment of Israel to fulfil its obligations under the\r\nagreements it signed with the Palestinians.\r\nDevelopments on the Korean peninsula have also\r\nbeen a matter of grave concern. Botswana is committed\r\nto the peaceful reunification of Korea.\r\nBotswana follows developments in Cyprus with keen\r\ninterest. The continued division of Cyprus is a serious\r\nviolation of the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof a Member State of the United Nations.\r\nLand-mines, particularly anti-personnel land-mines,\r\nare a major threat to humanity. Botswana strongly\r\nbelieves that the solution to the menace of anti-personnel\r\nland-mines lies in a total ban on production, stockpiling,\r\nexport and use. Existing protocols have provided only a\r\npartial solution to this problem. There is a glaring need\r\nfor a binding international legal instrument for the\r\nprogressive and ultimate elimination of these weapons.\r\nThe production, stockpiling and proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, of which nuclear weapons\r\nare the most lethal, is also a matter of deep concern to\r\nmy delegation. For far too long, non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates have been calling for an international legal\r\ninstrument to safeguard them against the threat or use of\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nthese weapons. The response of the nuclear Powers has\r\nbeen less than reassuring, to say the least. Unilateral\r\nstatements on security assurances, which have been\r\ntransmitted through a Security Council resolution, do not\r\nmeet the demands of the overwhelming majority of the\r\nmembership of this Organization.\r\nThe security of non-nuclear-weapon States from the\r\nthreat or use of these dangerous weapons can only be\r\nguaranteed by the institution of a legally binding\r\ninternational instrument. Botswana is committed to the early\r\nconclusion of such an instrument, and we hope that the\r\nnuclear-weapon States will demonstrate the necessary\r\ncommitment to meet the concerns of non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates.\r\nArticle VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons commits parties, inter alia, to reach\r\nagreement\r\n“on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament\r\nunder strict and effective international control”.\r\nUnfortunately, the nuclear-weapon States are resolutely\r\nopposed to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Not\r\nonly are these States resistant to this noble ideal, but they\r\ncontinue to develop new types of weapons. What\r\nconclusions are we expected to draw from this state of\r\naffairs?\r\nIt is difficult for nuclear-weapon States to claim the\r\nmoral high ground to dissuade any State from acquiring the\r\nsame weapons for the defence of its supreme national\r\ninterests, while they themselves consider such weapons a\r\nreliable means of self-defence. Nuclear-weapon States\r\nshould accept their responsibility to enter into and conclude\r\nnegotiations for the elimination of these weapons.\r\nThe General Assembly has repeatedly called upon the\r\nConference on Disarmament to accelerate consideration of\r\nthe question of the expansion of its membership. We thus\r\ncall upon the Conference on Disarmament to address\r\nspeedily the question of its expansion to the satisfaction of\r\nthe general membership of the United Nations.\r\nFive years have passed since the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was\r\nadopted by the General Assembly. While we all applauded\r\nthe adoption of the New Agenda, it has to be accepted that\r\nthe necessary operational framework was never put in place\r\nto ensure effective mobilization and disbursement of the\r\ntarget resources.\r\nConcerned about the poor performance of the United\r\nNations New Agenda, in March this year the Secretary-\r\nGeneral launched the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative for Africa, which has the backing of the World\r\nBank, among others. The Initiative envisages an\r\nexpenditure of some $25 billion over a 10-year period to\r\naddress identified sectoral development priorities. This is\r\na laudable Initiative which should afford Africa the\r\nopportunity to address effectively the critical nexus of\r\nfood security, population and the environment.\r\nFor their part, most African countries have met their\r\nobligations as spelled out in national structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes, in addition to the efforts made in the fields\r\nof democracy, human rights and good governance.\r\nAlthough southern Africa today enjoys relative peace and\r\nstability, it will continue to need special assistance in\r\norder to address the problems of reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment of the economic, physical and social\r\ninfrastructures which were destroyed or adversely affected\r\nby many years of war and racial injustice. We have no\r\ndoubt that the international community will complement\r\nour efforts so that we can launch our region on a firm\r\nroad to regional integration and economic development.\r\nBotswana is a strong proponent of the reform and\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations. My President, who is\r\na member of the Secretary-General’s United Nations\r\nPanel of High-level Personalities on African\r\nDevelopment, firmly believes in a more action-oriented\r\nand streamlined United Nations system that is able to\r\ndeliver. But we do not agree with those who advocate a\r\n“cut-cut” approach. There could be areas where additional\r\nstaff could be the catalyst to enhanced effectiveness and\r\nefficiency. What the world needs is a United Nations that\r\nhas the capacity to implement its programmes and\r\nprojects effectively and efficiently, a United Nations that\r\ncan put to better use the human and material resources at\r\nits disposal and one that can better guarantee international\r\npeace and security and promote international\r\nunderstanding.\r\nIt should be noted that the responsibility for the\r\nreform process, to a large extent, lies squarely with\r\nMember States and not with the Secretary-General,\r\nalthough he has a contribution to make in the whole\r\nprocess. Member States should therefore take full\r\nresponsibility for their inability to reach agreement on\r\nvarious aspects of the reform process and desist from\r\nseeking scapegoats for their failure to reach consensus on\r\na multifaceted international and structural reform of the\r\nOrganization.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nBotswana and other countries in southern Africa have\r\nnot been spared the scourge of illicit drug trafficking and\r\nconsumption. The Heads of State or Government of the\r\nSouthern African Development Community recently signed,\r\namong other instruments, a protocol on illicit drug\r\ntrafficking. The aim is to pool our resources — such as\r\npolice forces, customs authorities and drug enforcement\r\nagencies — to fight drug trafficking and other cross-border\r\ncrimes effectively. We look forward to continued\r\ninternational cooperation in this regard. We are hopeful\r\nthat these efforts will be crowned with success and will\r\nreceive the full support and cooperation of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe human immunodeficiency virus and acquired\r\nimmune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourge\r\nof our time and a serious threat to humanity. The socio-\r\neconomic consequences of the disease are a matter of\r\ngrave concern, and the international community should\r\nmake concerted efforts to address this human tragedy —\r\nwhich affects the young and the productive sectors of our\r\nsocieties in particular — before it is too late.\r\nTo conclude, my delegation reaffirms its total\r\nconfidence in the stewardship of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and pledges its loyalty and\r\ncooperation. We reaffirm our commitment to work with\r\nother delegations towards the strengthening of the United\r\nNations. We reaffirm our confidence in the manner in\r\nwhich the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, manages the affairs of our Organization.\r\nWe salute him for his visionary leadership and untiring\r\ncommitment to duty.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
