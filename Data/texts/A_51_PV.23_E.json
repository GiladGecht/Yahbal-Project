(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Zambia, Mr. Peter Kasanda.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): It is with great pleasure that\r\nI take this opportunity to warmly congratulate you on your\r\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-first regular session. Your election is a tribute\r\nnot only to your country, Malaysia, but also to you\r\npersonally. I am aware that you bring to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly wide experience in the field of\r\ninternational relations, from which we stand to benefit\r\nimmensely. I would also like to wish you every success in\r\nyour important duties. I would further like to affirm the\r\nreadiness of my delegation to cooperate with you in the\r\ndischarge of your duties.\r\nAllow me also to pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral of Portugal, who presided over the fiftieth regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly with great skill and\r\ndedication. His presidency did indeed enhance the\r\ndeliberative role of the General Assembly.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation would like to record its\r\nappreciation for the work of our esteemed Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, carried out under\r\ntrying conditions. Zambia greatly values the contribution of\r\nthe Secretary-General to the reform process of the United\r\nNations and can only hope that the entire membership\r\nwill give him a second term in order for him to complete\r\nthese reforms.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is distinctive\r\nbecause it is being held in the aftermath of the historic\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, which we\r\nobserved last year. It will be recalled that in observing\r\nand celebrating that important event, we made solemn\r\ncommitments to steer the world body towards the\r\nprogressive development of a world community that\r\nwould be cooperating effectively in dealing with global\r\nproblems in the interest of humanity. We also agreed that\r\nthe United Nations should be more democratic,\r\ntransparent and responsive and should be the common\r\nproperty of all the people of the world, in whose name it\r\nwas created in the first place. We went on to state that we\r\nwanted all citizens of the world to have real ownership of\r\nthe Organization. We also set for ourselves economic and\r\nsocial goals. In some cases, we went as far as to agree on\r\nspecific time-bound targets by which progress would be\r\nmeasured. This session, therefore, marks the beginning of\r\na process of fulfilling these solemn commitments that we\r\nmade last year.\r\nCrucial to fulfilling these commitments is the issue\r\nof the reform of the United Nations, which is now under\r\nway. Reform and continuous renewal are indispensable if\r\nthe future of the Organization is to be secured. All of us\r\nhave to play our part with the hope and determination\r\nnecessary to carry forward the United Nations reform\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nagenda with speed and thoroughness. In this way, we can\r\nwork towards strengthening the Organization and make it\r\nserve humanity more effectively. It is my conviction that\r\nthe United Nations can achieve greater success if we, the\r\nstakeholders, work towards creating a much improved\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs the twenty-first century approaches, the greatest\r\nchallenge facing the international community is to improve\r\nthe living conditions of the majority of people. Every\r\nhuman being must have access to opportunities that afford\r\na decent livelihood under conditions that are free from\r\nwant, disease, hunger and ignorance. The World Summit\r\nfor Social Development held in Copenhagen last year\r\nadopted a framework to deal with poverty and other social\r\nproblems. Far too many people, especially women and\r\nchildren, are vulnerable to marginalization and deprivation.\r\nWe need to invest more resources to end the conditions of\r\nendemic human deprivation existing in many parts of the\r\nworld today.\r\nThere are several other areas where we need to\r\nimprove the social conditions of life. The first ever World\r\nCongress on the Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in\r\nStockholm, Sweden, in August this year, presented in\r\ngraphic detail the atrocities being committed against\r\nchildren. Many young lives are being wasted in the huge,\r\nillegal international business of child prostitution and\r\npornography. As a civilized world, we cannot allow\r\nlifestyles that are attuned to the sexual abuse of children. It\r\nis the hope of my delegation that all countries of the world\r\nwill work expeditiously to implement the Agenda for\r\nAction adopted at the World Congress. In the same vein,\r\nthe international community must continue to protect and\r\npromote the rights of the child by implementing the\r\nprovisions of the Declaration and Programme of Action of\r\nthe World Summit for Children.\r\nThe United Nations has also articulated various\r\nprogrammes aimed at the improvement of the status of\r\nwomen and youth. Commitments contained in the Beijing\r\nDeclaration and Platform for Action, as well as the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond, require the devoted attention of the international\r\ncommunity, especially with regard to empowerment\r\nstrategies in the critical areas of employment, education,\r\nhealth and participation in societal decision-making. It is\r\nincumbent upon us all to honour the commitments we made\r\nin the declarations and the programmes of action. My\r\ncountry has committed itself to the attainment of the\r\nobjectives contained in these documents. Women and\r\nchildren are invaluable resources that can be neglected\r\nonly at the world’s own peril.\r\nIt is fitting that we begin this session shortly after\r\nthe adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT). Zambia supported the adoption of this\r\nTreaty because of our commitment to general and\r\ncomplete disarmament under effective international\r\ncontrol. It is in the same spirit that my country signed the\r\nPelindaba Treaty, establishing Africa as a nuclear-free\r\nzone, on 11 April this year. Zambia will be signing the\r\nCTBT with the hope that all other countries of the world\r\nwill do so as well, in the spirit of the traditional\r\nrecognition by the United Nations that disarmament is one\r\nof the priority questions of international relations. In this\r\nregard, Zambia would like to call on nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to inject a new spirit of commitment to ensuring\r\nnuclear disarmament, in accordance with article 6 of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation wishes to reiterate\r\nthe conviction that the time has indeed come for the\r\nconvening of another special session of the General\r\nAssembly, in 1999, devoted to disarmament. My\r\ndelegation believes that such a session would offer\r\nadditional possibilities for the international community to\r\nreview, from a perspective more in tune with the current\r\ninternational situation, the most critical aspects of the\r\nprocess of disarmament in the post-cold-war era.\r\nIt is common knowledge that in most of today’s\r\nconflicts the most widely used weapons are small arms\r\nand light weapons. None is more menacing than land-\r\nmines, the use of which is widespread. Currently more\r\nthan 110 million of them are buried in various parts of\r\nthe world, mostly in developing countries. The world\r\ncannot continue to lose human lives from these lethal\r\nweapons. In this regard, my delegation fully supports calls\r\nfor the banning at the global level of the use, stockpiling,\r\nproduction and sale of anti-personnel land-mines for all\r\ntime. Zambia will therefore support initiatives, during this\r\nsession of the General Assembly, to effect such a global\r\nban.\r\nThe issue of small arms and light weapons brings\r\nme to the question of conflicts in various parts of the\r\nworld that our Organization has increasingly been called\r\nupon to resolve. The international community faces the\r\nchallenge of bringing peace in countries where warring\r\nfactions show, in some cases, irreconcilable ethnic\r\ndifferences and other forms of intolerance.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nThe African region has its sad share of these conflicts\r\nthat have led to great loss of life, displacement of people\r\nand the disruption of vital economic activities. Burundi is\r\none such major challenge. The measures to restore the\r\nparliament in Burundi and unban political parties, which\r\nwere announced on 11 September by the military regime of\r\nMajor Pierre Buyoya, are steps in the right direction. My\r\ndelegation, however, wishes to underscore the point that\r\nchanges of Government should occur only through\r\nconstitutional and internationally accepted means.\r\nTherefore, unless and until a constitutional Government is\r\nestablished in Burundi, my Government will continue to\r\nwithhold recognition of the Buyoya regime. The immediate\r\naction of the countries of the Great Lakes region to impose\r\nsanctions on Burundi following the coup d’état of 25 July\r\n1996 deserves the commendation of the United Nations.\r\nThere is no doubt that this action is what has forced the\r\nmilitary Government in Burundi to restore the parliament\r\nand to unban political parties.\r\nWe are encouraged with regard to Rwanda by the fact\r\nthat the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has\r\nfinally been established and that its work has started. It is\r\nvitally important that the perpetrators of genocide in\r\nRwanda in 1994 should be brought to justice. This would\r\nserve as a deterrent to others who would otherwise be\r\ntempted to commit similar crimes. The re-emergence of\r\ngenocide, war crimes and other crimes against humanity\r\nshould be a source of great worry to the international\r\ncommunity. Such crimes should not be allowed to continue,\r\nbecause they violate fundamental human rights and strike\r\nat the very foundation of the international legal system.\r\nThe Economic Community of West African States\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) has done an admirable job\r\nof containing the situation in Liberia and preventing it from\r\ndegenerating further. We are now seeing more promising\r\nsteps towards the settlement of the conflict in Liberia. The\r\ngains achieved in Liberia can only be consolidated by the\r\ncontinued support of the international community for\r\nECOMOG so that the timetable adopted at the recent Abuja\r\nsummit can be effectively implemented.\r\nThe peace process in Angola is also on track, as\r\nevidenced by the quartering and disarmament, which are\r\nnow almost complete after some extensions. The Assembly\r\nis also aware that only two days ago the situation in Angola\r\nwas deliberated upon by Heads of State or Government of\r\nthe Southern African Development Community in order to\r\nbring the leadership of the Movimento Popular de\r\nLibertação de Angola-Partido Trabalhista (MPLA) and the\r\nUnião Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola\r\n(UNITA) together. Unfortunately, the UNITA leader,\r\nMr. Jonas Savimbi failed to attend.\r\nEfforts to bring peace to Angola will nevertheless\r\ncontinue. The regional summit on Angola demonstrated\r\nthe strong commitment of the leaders of southern Africa\r\nto the resolution of the conflict in Angola. However, the\r\ninternational community needs to be continuously\r\nengaged in order to ensure that the situation is resolved.\r\nWe urge that the integration of former UNITA guerrillas\r\ninto the national army of Angola be speeded up to\r\nconsolidate the peace process. Zambia would also like to\r\nurge Mr. Jonas Savimbi and other UNITA leaders to be\r\nmore resolute in the implementation of the commitments\r\nthey made in the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to commend the\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General on\r\nAngola, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, for the good work he\r\nhas done in the Angolan peace process. However, even\r\nwhen peace finally comes to Angola, it will be important\r\nfor the international community to provide assistance to\r\nthat country in areas that will facilitate rapid national\r\nreconstruction, such as mine clearance.\r\nThe issue of Western Sahara continues to be Africa’s\r\nlast unresolved colonial question. My delegation believes\r\nthat it is not beyond the wisdom of this Assembly to\r\novercome whatever obstacles may be standing in the way\r\nof a referendum. We would therefore like to appeal to the\r\nprincipal parties to cooperate with the Secretary-General\r\nin finding a lasting solution to this problem.\r\nWith regard to Somalia, my delegation is concerned\r\nat the apparent lack of efforts by the international\r\ncommunity towards finding a lasting solution to the crisis\r\nin that country. The situation in Somalia is also not\r\nconducive to regional peace and security. We therefore\r\ncall upon the international community to seek ways and\r\nmeans through appropriate organs to assist the people of\r\nSomalia to reach accommodation with each other, just as\r\nwe call on the Somali factions themselves to work\r\ntowards a genuine political settlement so that peace may\r\nreturn to that country.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is a source of great\r\ndanger to regional peace and security. We urge the parties\r\nto the conflict not to abandon but to consolidate the peace\r\nprocess brought about through sacrifice and painstaking\r\nwork. The violent confrontation that has taken place in\r\nthe past three days is a matter of grave concern to us.\r\nZambia still believes, however, that the parties will\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nharness the moral courage and the political will that are\r\nnecessary to return to the peace process. Zambia believes\r\nthat for the peace process to restart and gain momentum,\r\nthe new Government in Israel should respect and implement\r\nthe agreements already reached on the Middle East peace\r\nprocess, in accordance with the norms of international law.\r\nSince its inception, the United Nations has faced the\r\nchallenge of facilitating effective international economic\r\ncooperation. However, we have yet to attain a satisfactory\r\nlevel where countries of the world can pursue prospects for\r\ndevelopment through the machinery of the Organization.\r\nMultilateralism is indispensable to the management of the\r\nprocess of the globalization of the world economy that is\r\nnow going on. Major issues like foreign direct investment,\r\ncurrency stability, external debt problems, international\r\ntrade and commodity price stabilization require durable\r\nmultilateral cooperative arrangements.\r\nIt is the hope of my delegation that the current work\r\ntaking place at the United Nations on an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, the strengthening of the United Nations and\r\nprospective new modalities for financing operational\r\nactivities for development will generate possibilities to\r\nimplement fully the provisions of Chapter IX of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. It is also the hope of my delegation\r\nthat the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions will not\r\nfurther erode the capacity of the United Nations to deal\r\nwith economic questions.\r\nIt is, however, a matter of concern to my delegation\r\nthat United Nations agencies and departments are facing\r\nbudget cuts because of the continuing financial crisis of the\r\nworld body. Our concern is heightened by the fact that in\r\nMarch this year, the United Nations embarked on a decade-\r\nlong process of promoting African development through its\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa. The United\r\nNations, which is at the centre of the implementation of the\r\nSpecial Initiative, requires strong institutional capacities.\r\nThe continuing financial crisis is certainly going to erode\r\nthis institutional capacity further.\r\nThe Special Initiative and the Zambian economic\r\nreform programme complement each other. We hope that\r\nthis is also the case with other African countries. We are\r\nalso particularly happy that the Special Initiative gives\r\nprominence to peace-building, conflict resolution, national\r\nreconciliation and strengthening of the capacity for\r\ngovernance in the wide agenda of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment on the African continent. As is well known,\r\neconomic progress in Africa has all too often been\r\nundermined by conflicts.\r\nAs the international community supports African\r\ndevelopment, we once again draw its attention to the\r\nburden of external debt that is stunting African\r\ndevelopment. Both the Special Initiative and the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s recognize that the major obstacle to sustained\r\neconomic growth and development is the problem of\r\nexternal debt. It is the expectation of my delegation that\r\ndeeper debt reduction going beyond the Naples terms can\r\nbe agreed upon in the near future. Deep debt reduction\r\nwill go a long way in facilitating domestic savings and\r\ninvestments in Africa, especially in the social sectors, and\r\nthereby reduce poverty, environmental degradation and\r\ndependency on aid.\r\nBefore I conclude, I should say a few words about\r\nthe political situation in Zambia. In November 1991, my\r\ncountry embarked on a multi-party democratic process.\r\nWe are almost at the end of the first five-year period of\r\ndemocratization. Zambia will hold presidential and\r\nparliamentary elections this year under conditions of firm\r\npolitical stability. We are determined to maintain this\r\nstability by ensuring that peace prevails throughout the\r\nelection period. The Movement for Multiparty\r\nDemocracy, which is currently running the Government,\r\nhas been unequivocal in condemning all forms of political\r\nviolence and intolerance.\r\nThere is no political crisis in Zambia. The people of\r\nZambia have continued with their daily lives in peace,\r\nsecurity and full confidence in the political process of the\r\ncountry. In order to demonstrate good faith in the conduct\r\nof the democratic process, the Government of Zambia has\r\ninvited international observers to participate in monitoring\r\nour elections. These are in addition to local independent\r\nelection monitors. It is our desire that as many observers\r\nas possible should participate in this process, which is\r\naimed at consolidating democracy.\r\nZambia believes that the ideals of the United Nations\r\nare indispensable to the development of the partnership of\r\ncountries. It is therefore the supreme duty of all of us to\r\npromote and uphold them. In this context, I would like to\r\nconclude by reaffirming the faith of my delegation in the\r\nideals of the United Nations.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, President\r\nof the Republic of Suriname\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Suriname.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nMr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Wijdenbosch: May I first join preceding\r\nspeakers and congratulate you most sincerely, Sir, on behalf\r\nof the Government and the people of the Republic of\r\nSuriname on your unanimous election to the presidency of\r\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. On behalf\r\nof my delegation, I pledge you our full support as you carry\r\nout the weighty and challenging responsibilities of your\r\noffice. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral for the excellent and exemplary manner in which\r\nhe presided over the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe dynamic and extraordinary manner in which\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has accomplished his mission as\r\nSecretary-General in difficult circumstances of financial\r\nconstraints and wars within and among Nations, and his\r\nfostering of social and economic development, has earned\r\nour sincere gratitude. My Government believes that notable\r\nendeavours have been undertaken by His Excellency\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to shape the future of the United\r\nNations in accordance with the needs and aspirations of\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nAs members may know, the people of the Republic of\r\nSuriname, availing themselves of their fundamental\r\ndemocratic right through fair, free and secret elections on\r\n23 May and 5 September 1996, have elected the new\r\npolitical leadership of the country. As testimony to this\r\ndemocratic process, I stand before the Assembly on behalf\r\nof my Government and people as the newly elected\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMy Government believes that the main challenge\r\nfacing us is the difficult task of reversing the current\r\ntendency towards the social disintegration of the nation into\r\na process of nation- building and creating social harmony.\r\nThe need for this is even more pressing, considering\r\nthat Suriname has a small population, composed of different\r\nethnic and indigenous groups and that the living conditions\r\nof large segments of its population have deteriorated\r\nsignificantly. One of the fundamental problems in meeting\r\nthis challenge lies in the development of an economy that\r\nis diversified and not dependent on just one economic\r\nsector — and even less, dependent on a single donor\r\ncountry.\r\nIn order to ensure that our people have the actual\r\nenjoyment of human rights in the widest sense of the\r\nword, a social system will be created that will focus\r\nattention on guaranteeing every citizen minimal social\r\nsecurity; creating a society in which the quality of life is\r\nequal for all and harmony is safeguarded; offering\r\nSurinamese women greater opportunities to develop their\r\npotentialities and to participate in the social structures, as\r\nwell as enhancing, in the widest sense of the word, the\r\ncare for the Surinamese child; providing for the basic\r\nneeds of the people, such as food supply, health care,\r\neducation, housing, public transport, water supply,\r\nemployment, passable roads and affordable energy supply;\r\nand guaranteeing the protection of property by means of\r\nadequate security.\r\nThe Government of Suriname is aware that the\r\nrealization of these tasks will demand great efforts from\r\nthe Government itself and from the entire population. In\r\nthis endeavour we shall work to bring about the\r\nadministrative and budgetary decentralization of the\r\nadministration through the strengthening of people-\r\noriented democracy by giving participatory democracy the\r\nscope to develop.\r\nThe decentralization of legislation and administration\r\nwill be given further attention, to facilitate regional and\r\nlocal development, with the full participation of regional\r\nand local structures. The necessary conditions will be\r\ncreated for an integrated approach to the development of\r\nthe districts and the interior, so as to eliminate\r\ndevelopment lag in these regions. We fully realize that the\r\nresponsibility for achieving this goal lies primarily with\r\nthe Government and the people of Suriname. We\r\nacknowledge, however, that we live in a larger world, in\r\na period in which having friendly relations is of eminent\r\nimportance. In accordance with international law, and on\r\nthe basis of the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nprinciples of the Non-Aligned Movement, Suriname will\r\nestablish and maintain relations with friendly nations and\r\ninternational and regional organizations throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nClose relations with countries that are our\r\nneighbours from a historical, cultural or geographical\r\npoint of view, especially France, Brazil and Guyana, and\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nwith Venezuela, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the\r\nUnited States of America, will be maintained and deepened.\r\nFurthermore, we will strengthen our efforts for full\r\nintegration into the subregion, into the wider Caribbean\r\nregion and into the Americas through our membership in\r\nthe Caribbean Community and the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates and through our participation in the free-trade zone\r\nto be established in the year 2005.\r\nThis approach demands a more business-like stance in\r\nmultilateral and bilateral relations as concerns the principles\r\nof equality, mutual respect, and the interest and protection\r\nof our national sovereignty.\r\nOne of the most important characteristics of our era is\r\nthe transitional phase we are going through, in which new\r\nideas, new Powers, new values and norms have arisen,\r\nleaving their mark on both national and international\r\npolitics, on the national and international economy, and on\r\nthe formation and content of international relations. The\r\nUnited Nations, which plays a crucial role in defining\r\ninternational relations and creating favourable conditions for\r\npeace, stability and development, reflects this transitional\r\nprocess.\r\nIn considering the need to redefine the role and tasks\r\nof the United Nations in the post-cold-war era, some people\r\nquestion whether the United Nations still has a role to play\r\nin the international arena. As far as Suriname is concerned,\r\nthe United Nations, as a centre of multilateral relations, has\r\ndemonstrated its ability to play a unique role in the\r\nachievement of overall human development on a global\r\nscale. The United Nations has also demonstrated an\r\nextraordinary capacity for giving primacy to the ideals and\r\naspirations enshrined in its Charter, and has indeed proved\r\nto be effective in the pursuit of such essential tasks as the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAlong these lines, we would like to emphasize that the\r\ncontinuation of the United Nations as a centre for\r\nmultilateral discussion and action is indispensable. We\r\nacknowledge the need, however, to redefine its functions.\r\nFirst, there is a clear need to reform its bureaucratic\r\nstructures in order to make it more effective and efficient\r\nand to bring it more in line with the aspirations of the\r\nmajority of the world’s population. Secondly, we must\r\nabide by our obligations under the Charter of the United\r\nNations to provide the necessary funds for its proper\r\nfunctioning, even though a restructuring of the current scale\r\nof assessed contributions could be considered.\r\nWe believe that if the United Nations is considered\r\nas a train of peace and development on these two tracks,\r\nhumankind will embrace our Organization, which will\r\nhelp us to move forward into the twenty-first century.\r\nOn the eve of the new millennium, it is imperative\r\nfor the international community to seek solutions to\r\npressing problems, of which abject poverty may well be\r\nthe most compelling. The solemn commitments of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the launching\r\nof 1996 as the International Year for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty and the period 1997-2006 as the United Nations\r\nDecade for the Eradication of Poverty have our full\r\nsupport. There is evidence the world over that continuing\r\npoverty, if not addressed adequately, will result in social\r\ndisharmony and in economic and political disorder, and\r\nwill become a threat to national and international peace\r\nand stability, thereby negatively affecting the growth and\r\nconsolidation of democracy and human rights.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nLet it be understood that all efforts to combat the\r\nscourge of illicit drug trafficking, terrorism and organized\r\ncrime will prove to be fruitless unless we present a united\r\nfront to eradicate poverty.\r\nSuriname has drawn unexpected international\r\nattention by its resolve to employ its timber resources for\r\nthe development of its people. My Government is aware\r\nof the concern of the international community as to the\r\npossible consequences of an unsustainable use of our\r\nforest. There are many examples throughout the world on\r\nhow we should not proceed, and we have learned from\r\nthose experiences.\r\nIn order to strike a proper balance between our\r\nactual needs for development and the needs of future\r\ngenerations, the Government of Suriname will abide by\r\nthe commitment expressed through its contribution at the\r\nRio Conference in 1992 and to the subsequent\r\ninvestigations and deliberations at various levels of\r\nsociety in conjunction with foreign investors. In all these\r\nendeavours we will continue to be cautious, with due\r\nregard for the interests of potential investors, the interests\r\nof our indigenous people and the need to protect the\r\ninterests of future generations.\r\nWe hope that the international community will also\r\nabide by its obligation to provide the necessary\r\ntechnological and financial assistance, thus contributing to\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nthe achievement of these goals. In this respect we look\r\nforward to the coming review meeting on the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Suriname is very\r\nconcerned about the problem of illicit drug trafficking,\r\nbecause it poses special security problems for countries\r\nsuch as Suriname, which have insufficient resources to\r\nguard its hundreds of miles of shoreline and vast,\r\nunderpopulated land areas. Therefore, as part of our policy\r\nof maximum cooperation in the fight against drugs, we\r\nhave entered into cooperation agreements with many\r\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially\r\nwith those States adjacent to Suriname. In this context, I\r\nshould like to mention the recently established and much\r\nappreciated cooperation between Surinamese police\r\nauthorities and the drug enforcement agencies of the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America. However,\r\nfinding an adequate solution to the drug problem will\r\ndepend in no small measure on whether equal attention is\r\ngiven to both the supply and the demand sides of this\r\nphenomenon.\r\nWhile reflecting on the issues facing our world and\r\namidst the many challenges to creating global solidarity, my\r\nGovernment wishes to express its serious concerns over the\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East, which have resulted in a\r\nvirtual discontinuation of the historic peace process. We\r\nhope that the parties concerned and the international\r\ncommunity will succeed in bringing the peace process back\r\non track. The agony of bloodshed and the loss of lives must\r\nbe avoided, and there are no alternatives to dialogue and\r\npeace.\r\nI am deeply honoured to have had the opportunity to\r\naddress this body on a number of issues that are of prime\r\nimportance to the Government and the people of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname. I would like to conclude by\r\nreiterating our commitment to contribute to the creation of\r\na new world order characterized by the eradication of\r\npoverty and based on a more just distribution of wealth and\r\non an atmosphere that augurs well for peace and global\r\nimprovement of the quality of life on this beautiful planet.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nSuriname for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jules Albert Wijdenbosch, President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Chairman\r\nof the delegation of Panama and former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Jorge Illueca.\r\nMr. Illueca (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe delegation of Panama wishes to join in the very\r\nwarm congratulations that the President has already\r\nreceived from the speakers who have preceded me. His\r\nwell-deserved election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session attests to his skills and\r\npersonal merits, and at the same time reflects the esteem\r\nthat Malaysia, a prominent member of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has come to enjoy in\r\nthe family of nations.\r\nI am also very pleased that this particular part of our\r\nmeeting is being chaired by our colleague from the\r\nPhilippines, Ambassador Mabilangan.\r\nAllow me on this solemn occasion to pay tribute to\r\nthe eminent Portuguese statesman Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral, who presided over the historic fiftieth session\r\nwith great wisdom, poise and humanism and shed his\r\nparticular light on the institutional reform of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAt the fiftieth session of the General Assembly\r\nPanama proposed, together with the United States and\r\nFrance, that the United Nations and interested countries\r\nshould take a decisive part in the holding of the Universal\r\nCongress on the Panama Canal, which will take place in\r\nSeptember 1997. On that occasion the Assembly adopted\r\nresolution 50/12 (1995), which in its operative part,\r\n“Urges the competent organs, programmes and\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system,\r\nin particular, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme and the International Maritime\r\nOrganization, to study the possibility of providing\r\nassistance from within existing resources for the\r\norganization of the Universal Congress on the\r\nPanama Canal”. (resolution 50/12, para. 3)\r\nIn the first operative paragraph the Assembly noted\r\nthat it\r\n“Supports the initiative of the Government of\r\nPanama in convening the Universal Congress on the\r\nPanama Canal, with the participation of\r\nGovernments, international bodies, public and\r\nprivate academic institutions, maritime users and\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\ninternational shipping companies, to examine jointly\r\nthe role which the Panama Canal should play in the\r\ntwenty-first century”. (Ibid., para. 1)\r\nThe Government of Panama has a particular interest in\r\nseeing that Member States of the United Nations, as well as\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations of\r\nthe international community, are informed about how\r\nPanama, as a sovereign State, is preparing to take on all the\r\nresponsibilities stemming from the final transfer of the\r\ninteroceanic canal in 1999, pursuant to the provisions of the\r\nTorrijos-Carter Treaties.\r\nOne calendar year from the holding of the Congress,\r\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that the Panamanian\r\nGovernment is hard at work on preparations and stepping\r\nup consultations with international organizations and\r\nfriendly countries in order to secure meaningful\r\nparticipation. The Panama Canal Congress will be universal\r\nin terms of participation; it will also be universal because\r\nPanama, with its universalist and Bolivarian traditions, takes\r\nthe view that international maritime transport should be\r\nopen uninterruptedly to all the flags of the world on an\r\nequal footing and under a neutral and universal regime that\r\nobliges us all to ensure its peaceful use and transit, taking\r\ninto account the expansion of international trade and the\r\ngrowth of the world economy.\r\nOurs is a time in which nations appear to be closer\r\nthan ever and in which there are tremendous opportunities\r\nto improve the living conditions of all. At the same time,\r\nthe existence of numerous imbalances, obstacles, risks and\r\ndangers gives Governments and peoples grounds for\r\nconcern.\r\nIt is not only remarkable achievements of science,\r\ntechnology and trade that are being globalized;\r\nunfortunately, hunger and environmental degradation are\r\nalso being globalized. There are still national and\r\ninternational situations that are marked by the denial of\r\nfundamental values and that affect human rights and the\r\nfreedom of peoples. There are growing inequalities between\r\nmembers of our societies and between nations, and certain\r\ninjustices still persist in some aspects of international\r\nrelations. Arms trafficking and overt or covert resistance to\r\nagreements and initiatives to reverse the arms race are signs\r\nthat attitudes of expediency are prevailing, to the detriment\r\nof our hopes for peace and agreement and our aspirations\r\nto sustainable development. Terrorism, organized crime and\r\ntransnational crime conspire and feed off one another on an\r\nunprecedented international scale, exploiting the many faces\r\nof drug use, which is a threat to all mankind.\r\nThese concerns dominated the agenda of the Rio\r\nGroup at its tenth summit, held a month ago in\r\nCochabamba, Bolivia. It was an opportunity to underscore\r\nat the highest possible political level the serious\r\nchallenges facing Latin America and the Caribbean,\r\nwhose average poverty levels have reached alarming\r\nlevels despite the tremendous efforts of our Governments\r\nto reduce them.\r\nAt that meeting the Panamanian Government\r\nstated — and I reaffirm here in this forum — that poverty\r\nand corruption are powerful forces threatening the\r\ndemocracies of the continent. On that occasion, the\r\nPresident of Panama, Mr. Ernesto Pérez Balladares,\r\nstated:\r\n“When Nations embark on political adventures\r\ndivorced from institutionality, they do not do so\r\nbecause they reject in theory the benefits of\r\ndemocracy, but because they associate their own\r\ndespair with the regime under which they live ... For\r\nthis reason, until the new concepts governing\r\neconomic relations among countries today and\r\ndemocracy throughout the continent are accompanied\r\nby investment in social sectors and a genuine\r\nmodernization of education to help close the gap, the\r\nsectors of the population affected by poverty will\r\nultimately reject what we here today quite rightly\r\nthink should be permanent values of modern\r\nsocieties.”\r\nFor this reason, we wish to reiterate our\r\nunderstanding of and solidarity with the problems of\r\nhunger and poverty suffered by countries in other regions,\r\nin particular the least developed countries, the majority of\r\nwhich are in Africa, and certain countries in our region\r\nthat are particularly vulnerable. Whatever may be the\r\nstandpoint chosen for consideration of the great issues\r\ncontained on the agenda of this fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we should always approach them with\r\nthe desire to respond appropriately.\r\nThe organization of social life always presupposes\r\nnormative vision and action. The United Nations has\r\nproved its capacity to propose to the international\r\ncommunity a body of norms whose effectiveness depends\r\non their universal application. The fundamental debate\r\nthat has been going on in the area of human rights since\r\nthe creation of the United Nations has resulted in the\r\nenshrinement of those rights in legally binding texts and\r\nin declarations and programmes of action stemming from\r\nthe major conferences held by the United Nations in\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nrecent years. We are encouraged by the fact that that\r\nenshrinement is encompassing the rights of solidarity in the\r\ncontext of problems concerning the environment,\r\npopulation, society, women’s issues and housing.\r\nThe Government of Panama is mindful of the complex\r\ndialectic interactions between peace, human rights and\r\ndevelopment. The desire to ensure effective democratization\r\nin national life and to foster development is at the core of\r\nthe activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to\r\nbenefit children, young people, women, indigenous and\r\nrural populations, the disabled and certain particularly\r\ndisadvantaged urban groups.\r\nThe Government’s activities relating to fulfilment of\r\nthe Platform for Action adopted at the Beijing Conference\r\non Women represent commitments strengthened by our\r\njustifiable satisfaction over Panama’s fairly encouraging\r\nindicators regarding the advancement of women. The accent\r\nis currently being placed on the sector of the female\r\npopulation living in unfavourable conditions of health,\r\nhousing and education and having little participation in\r\npolitical life.\r\nIn the context of this constantly renewed effort to find\r\nthe best solutions to national problems, the delegation of\r\nPanama wishes to express to the Secretary-General our\r\nthanks and recognition for the cooperation activities that\r\nhave been carried out in Panama by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, as a recognized and neutral\r\nfacilitator, to promote national consensus on the Panama\r\nCanal issues. The successes already achieved in this area\r\ndemonstrate that the actions of the United Nations its\r\nsystem in Panama are effective and have an impact on the\r\nlife of the nation.\r\nThree months ago Panama ratified the Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, the implementation of which has\r\nbecome more effective since the establishment of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority and the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. Panama, as a maritime\r\ncountry, welcomes these promising developments and hopes\r\nthat there will be further achievements in the application of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nThe Government of Panama has great expectations for\r\nits future participation as a member of the Governing\r\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment Programme and\r\nin the Commission on Sustainable Development. We will\r\nstrive to make our contribution and to prove our\r\ncommitment to overcoming environmental problems. The\r\nstrategic importance of issues associated with biodiversity\r\nis such that my Government hopes that new and\r\nadditional funds will be made available to promote\r\nactivities in this field. We have the same hope in\r\nconnection with climate change, the ozone layer,\r\ndesertification and the conservation of forests.\r\nIn the area of international peace and security, we\r\nreconfirm our agreement with those Governments that\r\nadvocate a total ban on the production, use, trafficking in\r\nand transfer of anti-personnel land-mines. With respect to\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has\r\nbeen signed by Panama, we continue to hold the same\r\nview as in previous years. In this respect, we welcome\r\nBrazil’s initiative to make the southern hemisphere a zone\r\nfree of nuclear weapons. This estimable initiative adds to\r\nthe efforts of Latin America and the Caribbean to foster\r\na world free of nuclear weapons, efforts that were\r\nlaunched with the signing and ratification of the\r\nTlatelolco Treaty.\r\nUpon learning of the response of the International\r\nCourt of Justice to the request issued by the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session, my Government\r\nwelcomed the backing given by that principal organ of\r\nthe United Nations to the negotiations on a ban on\r\nnuclear weapons, including tests. We signed the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty on the\r\nunderstanding that implicit in it is a commitment on the\r\npart of world Powers to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nworld.\r\nPanama has always supported those who believe that\r\nif a part of the funds absorbed by the arms industry could\r\nbe made available to combat poverty, ignorance and\r\ndisease, there would be positive changes all over the face\r\nof our Earth.\r\nPanama has already expressed in the United Nations\r\nits position and views on the problem of drugs, most\r\nrecently at the high-level segment of the substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council in June. We\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our support\r\nof Mexico’s initiative, co-sponsored by the Rio Group, on\r\nconvening a special session of the General Assembly in\r\n1998, which would offer an opportunity to update the\r\nvarious debates, concepts, approaches and consensus\r\npositions on the issue of illicit drugs and related crimes.\r\nThe Government of Panama has made significant progress\r\nin developing the proposal presented to the Rio Group to\r\ncreate a multilateral centre in Panama to combat drug\r\ntrafficking and related crimes.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nWe are glad to announce the recent holding in our\r\ncountry of the first international talks on the creation of that\r\ncentre, attended by Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico,\r\nPeru, Venezuela and Panama. We agreed at that meeting to\r\nhold another meeting in December 1996 to take decisions\r\non the training module included in the plans for the\r\nmultilateral training and research institute to combat drug\r\ntrafficking and related crimes. Another meeting will take\r\nplace early in 1997 to study and decide upon the\r\noperational module as a means of combatting drug\r\ntrafficking and related crimes, which is essentially civilian\r\nin nature and cooperating with the military forces that will\r\nlend additional support.\r\nIn a similar vein, the Panamanian Government also\r\nlends its support and solidarity to the international\r\ncommunity’s struggle to combat terrorism. Terrorist\r\nactivity, no matter what the reasoning behind it may be, is\r\ncriminal and immoral, and exceeds all limits. Its sole face\r\nis that of fanaticism. Terrorism is the offspring of the\r\napocalypse, nihilistic and gratuitous in nature, capable of\r\ncrushing human freedom and claiming a terrible harvest of\r\ninnocent lives.\r\nOther topics on the agenda of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly are of particular interest to the\r\nGovernment of Panama. Negotiations on establishing an\r\nAgenda for Development oblige us not only to talk about\r\nthis but to act, prompted by the universal duty to cooperate\r\nwhich encompasses all individuals and all communities.\r\nThe common undertaking of sustainable development\r\nshould be carried out through shared responsibilities. For\r\nthis reason, we welcome the decision taken by Member\r\nStates to politically reactivate the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Now, what is needed is the political will to equip\r\nthe United Nations with an Agenda for Development which\r\nwill not limit development solely to its economic\r\ncomponent: though that is necessary, it is not enough.\r\nDevelopment should also provide the key part of common\r\nwell-being and be placed at the service of purposes\r\nconsciously accepted by all, purposes that will enrich the\r\nlives of all, purposes that will enhance the creative capacity\r\nof every individual and be securely grounded in a human\r\ndimension which implies faith in oneself and paves the way\r\nfor progress.\r\nWhatever approach is taken in addressing the major\r\nissues on the agenda of this fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the human being, his hopes and\r\nsufferings and the obstacles and opportunities he faces to\r\nimprove the quality of his life, should always have\r\nprecedence. In spite of the dazzling clarity with which we\r\nperceive this certainty, it would seem that we sometimes\r\nlose sight of the fact that the human individual is the\r\nultimate focus of this Organization and of all the\r\nagreements and plans of actions that we arrive at within\r\nit and stemming from it. All our decisions should be\r\ndesigned to meet the demands, needs, requirements and\r\ninterests of human beings.\r\nThis requires a revitalization of the ethical side of\r\nthe United Nations. My delegation appreciates the\r\nendeavours of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali. He has placed his unquestioned talent and\r\nefforts at the service of the Organization. His unswerving\r\ninternationalism and his commitment to world peace and\r\ndevelopment mean that Panama takes great pleasure in\r\nexpressing its gratitude for his work.\r\nA year ago we were welcoming the effort made by\r\ntwo great men who were struggling tirelessly to\r\nconsolidate peace agreements and move towards peaceful\r\ncoexistence in the Middle East. Today one of those men\r\nis no longer with us. Panama wishes to express a\r\nposthumous tribute of recognition to Yitzhak Rabin, a\r\nmartyr of the peace process between two peoples,\r\nPalestine and Israel, with which our people and our\r\nGovernment have deeply-rooted friendly relations because\r\nthe children of those peoples live together on our soil and\r\nare helping us to build a better country. Now that\r\nfratricidal struggle is casting both nations into mourning,\r\nPanama reaffirms its support for all the initiatives and\r\nresolutions that will strengthen peace and promote\r\ntolerance.\r\nWe are very concerned about the events which took\r\nplace as a result of changes effected in the Holy Sites of\r\nJerusalem, to which the Security Council referred in its\r\nresolution 1073 (1996) on Saturday, 28 September 1996.\r\nThe Security Council called for an immediate cessation\r\nand reversal of all acts that had resulted in the\r\naggravation of the situation and that had negative\r\nimplications for the Middle East peace process. It\r\nlikewise called for the safety and protection of the\r\nPalestinian civilians to be ensured. Finally, it called for\r\nthe immediate resumption of negotiations within the\r\nMiddle East peace process on its agreed basis and the\r\ntimely implementation of the agreements reached.\r\nAnother matter of concern to us relates to the\r\nChinese people, a people with which Panama has\r\nmaintained relations since very early in the last century.\r\nMy country has benefitted from a continued migration\r\nwhich, from the building of the interoceanic railway to\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nthat of the Canal, has contributed to our development and\r\nto the fashioning of our national identity. This deep-rooted\r\nand lasting relationship with the Chinese people has\r\nstrengthened our nation’s and our Governments’ support for\r\nthe principle of the universality of the United Nations.\r\nPanama maintains diplomatic relations with the Republic of\r\nChina and feels bound to state that those relations have\r\nbeen fruitful and beneficial. They have always been\r\ncharacterized by respect and have been receptive to and\r\nincorporated the interests and needs of both sides. For this\r\nreason, we feel that our relations are exemplary in the best\r\npossible sense.\r\nOn the other hand, in a few years’ time Panama will\r\nassume full responsibility for the interoceanic Canal and, in\r\nthe context of that responsibility, Panama must\r\nacknowledge that the People’s Republic of China is one of\r\nthe main users of the waterway both in terms of the number\r\nof vessels and in terms of the volume of cargo originating\r\nin or destined for the People’s Republic of China. We are\r\nencouraged by the fact that a significant number of Chinese\r\ncitizens and companies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait\r\nlive and work in harmony in Panama, where they have won\r\nthe respect and affection of Panamanians because of their\r\ndiligent hard work. We are convinced of the validity of the\r\nprinciple of one China, and we reaffirm our support for the\r\nefforts of both parties to unify the Chinese people. We\r\nreiterate our conviction that they will achieve that purpose\r\nin a framework of mutual respect that gradually helps to\r\nbuild trust between the two parties and create a favourable\r\nenvironment for Chinese reunification.\r\nThe question of Security Council reform, the increase\r\nin the number of its members and other related matters is\r\nof irrefutable importance for the United Nations, as is the\r\nquestion of the strengthening of the role of the United\r\nNations. It is unacceptable to try to change the membership\r\nof the Security Council solely on the basis of supposed\r\nessential features that make certain countries more suitable\r\nthan others to join decision-making organs and hold seats\r\nin the Security Council. Because of the functions it\r\nperforms, today’s state of affairs and a moral commitment\r\nto the future of the United Nations, we call for a reform of\r\nthe Security Council that will provide regional\r\nrepresentation, an increase in both membership\r\ncategories — permanent and non-permanent — and\r\nequitable distribution.\r\nThe Government of Panama regards the Italian\r\nproposal as a democratic approach that responds to the\r\nconcern for representativity. We were encouraged by the\r\nwillingness to negotiate, with a view to achieving\r\nconsensus, voiced by the Italian Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs last week from this rostrum. In the issues of\r\nSecurity Council reform and the strengthening of the role\r\nof the United Nations, the best possible ideas and loftiest\r\npurposes should come into play. We wish to see a better,\r\nmore effective and more representative Security Council.\r\nWe would also like to see opportunities to participate in\r\nthe United Nations go hand in hand with the\r\nresponsibility to act to ensure international peace and\r\nsecurity and for these to be seen from the perspective of\r\ntheir relationships with democracy and development. The\r\nPanamanian Government has decided to reaffirm its\r\nsupport for Japan and Germany having permanent seats\r\non the Security Council.\r\nI could not conclude without fulfilling my duty as a\r\nPanamanian to reiterate before this world Organization\r\nthat Panama is ready to assume sovereign control over the\r\nPanama Canal in 1999, with all the administrative,\r\noperational and security responsibilities entailed in the full\r\nimplementation of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.\r\nPanamanians’ shouldering of the main responsibility for\r\nthe Panama Canal will coincide with the advent of the\r\ntwenty-first century. We shall march resolutely into the\r\nnew millennium, looking forward to a promising future in\r\nwhich it will become clear that Panama’s universalist\r\nvocation has never wavered, and we strongly reaffirm that\r\nvocation.\r\nPanama’s universalism, I am proud to say, is an\r\nethical one, capable of absorbing the most diverse\r\ncurrents of thought and human action, whether from the\r\nNorth, South, East or West. Our geography made us this\r\nway, and our history opened us up to the world —\r\nobviously, commercially, but above all culturally.\r\nAs of 31 December 1999 Panama will be better\r\nintegrated in the world because it will be able to make\r\nfree use of its entire territory for the integration of its\r\nnation. We shall then have to cope with the tremendous\r\nneed to make full use of our potential and abilities and to\r\nfully exercise our rights and fulfil our responsibilities. On\r\n31 December 1999 the Panamanian nation will be at the\r\ncentre of an excitement sparked by the joining in our\r\nveins and souls, of the past and the future, of the\r\nstruggles of generations, of joy and suffering and of the\r\nmany endeavours that all bear the same name, a name\r\nthat designates a common objective, a single mission that\r\nmany times engendered fervour and even heroism.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, Panama will still be a\r\nsmall country. What will be different, I repeat, is the full\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nintegration of the Panamanian nation in its territory, the\r\nsimple but intense and far-reaching meeting of a nation\r\nwith the entirety of its territory. The existence of an\r\ninteroceanic waterway, the Panama Canal, in that territory\r\nwill prompt us to pursue, step up and deepen our efforts to\r\nestablish the right approaches and institutions to complete\r\nour sovereign life as a nation and to facilitate the fulfilment\r\nof our universalist vocation. That universalism will make it\r\npossible for us to continue to participate in the realities of\r\na globalized and interdependent world with the desire to\r\nmake it a source of mutual enrichment, openness, initiative\r\nand creativity.\r\nIt is a fortunate historical coincidence that on\r\nWednesday of this week, 2 October 1996, the General\r\nCouncil of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decided\r\nto accept the report of its subsidiary organ concerning\r\nPanama’s accession, thus ensuring its entry as a full\r\nmember of the World Trade Organization. We welcome the\r\nfact that, with the accession of Panama, all countries in the\r\nLatin American region have become members of the WTO.\r\nWe all aspire to see a United Nations that will be\r\nready to deal with present and future problems. Panama\r\nhopes to contribute to the vital consensuses and aspires to\r\nbecome part of the necessary renewal of the United\r\nNations. As part of the Panamanian experience since the\r\ncreation of the United Nations, I personally have taken part\r\nin the Organization’s intergovernmental machinery often\r\nenough to be able to speak of faith. With faith in the\r\nUnited Nations, we have often been capable of moving\r\nmountains of mistrust and misunderstanding, which have\r\ncovered the world in a landscape of conflict and deadlock.\r\nThanks to that faith in the United Nations, today we can\r\nspeak of new generations of human rights and new\r\ngenerations of peacekeeping operations, which, in the view\r\nof men and women of my generation are proof that the\r\nUnited Nations represents a victory over the erosive effects\r\nof time and history.\r\nMy delegation believes that the United Nations has\r\naccomplished wonderful tasks through its constructive\r\nconsideration of various manifestations of human diversity\r\nand through the taking of decisions that give them a\r\nproductive, secure and peaceful place on Earth.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is His\r\nExcellency Mr. Poseci Bune, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nFiji, upon whom I now call.\r\nMr. Bune (Fiji): My delegation joins others in warmly\r\ncongratulating Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election to\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. His election is indeed, and in fact, a tribute\r\nboth to him and to his great country, Malaysia. I would\r\nassure him of my delegation’s full cooperation during his\r\ntenure of office.\r\nIt also gives me great pleasure to extend the\r\nprofound gratitude of my delegation to the outgoing\r\nPresident of the historic fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, who\r\npresided over the session with such great skill, dexterity\r\nand expertise.\r\nLasting peace and security on our planet are the very\r\ncornerstones of progress and prosperity in our nation\r\nStates. They are the cornerstones of accelerated\r\ndevelopment, to which we all, developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries, aspire.\r\nMankind has fervently sought to live in peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the ages, but lasting peace and\r\nsecurity in our world have been very elusive, particularly\r\nduring this century. In the early part of this century, we\r\nbecame embroiled in the First World War. We all thought\r\nthat that was the war to end all wars, and then came the\r\nSecond World War, two decades later. It was the worst\r\ndestructive war of our times, and it left many challenges\r\nto peace and security in its wake.\r\nThe end of the war saw our world bipolarized and\r\nbusy with the pursuit of spheres of influence by the two\r\nsuper-Powers, which culminated in a new era, the cold-\r\nwar era. Prospects for peace and security in our world\r\nfaded as the super-Powers and other major Powers began\r\na race for the production and stockpiling of new weapons\r\nof war and mass destruction.\r\nThe world entered a new phase, the nuclear age,\r\nwhen several Powers began to develop, test and produce\r\nnuclear weapons. The testing of those weapons to make\r\nthem even more powerful took place in many parts of the\r\nworld, including my country’s own region in the South\r\nPacific. In such a milieu, peace and security became a\r\nconstant prayer but a distant hope, as many of us in the\r\nnon-nuclear world were filled with foreboding that our\r\nworld was on the brink of nuclear extinction.\r\nIn such a horrific scenario, common sense began to\r\nprevail, and that common sense, buoyed by the initiatives\r\nof this important Organization, the United Nations, led to\r\nthe conclusion of several important but limited treaties\r\nand to the Conference on Disarmament. Those initiatives\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nwere ultimately crowned with success when, on 10\r\nSeptember 1996, in an extended fiftieth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly, the vast majority of the\r\nworld’s nations adopted the text of a Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the CTBT.\r\nIn the context of the South Pacific region, with the\r\nadoption of the CTBT, the signature by the United States\r\nof America, the United Kingdom and France of the\r\nProtocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty —\r\nthe Treaty of Rarotonga — and the ratification by France\r\nof the Protocols, my country and the countries of the region\r\ncan breathe a sigh of relief at the cessation of the assault on\r\nour environment. Now our Governments can focus on the\r\neconomic and social utilization of our natural resources to\r\nimprove and increase the standard of living of our peoples\r\nwithout having to worry as much as we have in the past\r\nabout the effects nuclear testing was having on the health\r\nof our people and the environment of the region. To further\r\nenhance this positive and welcome development, we urge\r\nthe United States and the United Kingdom to ratify the\r\nProtocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty.\r\nMy country hails the adoption of the CTBT as one of\r\nthe greatest achievements of the international community\r\nthis century. It represents an imposing foundation for the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace and security in our world.\r\nThe CTBT may not be the paragon of virtue most of\r\nus probably expected it to be. It is, nevertheless, a bold and\r\nconstructive initiative that is meaningful and at the same\r\ntime a reassurance of our survival of the nuclear menace.\r\nAll of us must take the responsibility of assuring the\r\nsuccess of the Treaty. My country calls on all nations of the\r\nworld, in the interest of lasting peace and security on our\r\nplanet and in the interest of all mankind, to sign and ratify\r\nthe CTBT. Fiji signed the CTBT the day it was opened for\r\nsignature. My Government has already decided to ratify it.\r\nIn the final analysis, we do not see the adoption of the\r\nCTBT as the final nail in the coffin of nuclear weapons. To\r\nachieve our ultimate and pre-eminent aim and our desire for\r\nlasting peace and security in our world, my country would\r\nlike to see the CTBT as merely the first step towards an\r\nend to the production of all nuclear weapons, an end to the\r\nstockpiling of all nuclear weapons, the ultimate destruction\r\nof all nuclear weapons, the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world and general disarmament as a whole.\r\nToday, while we rejoice with a degree of relief at the\r\nadoption and signing of the CTBT, it is at the same time\r\nalso incumbent upon us not to relax our vigilance with\r\nregard to the moves and proposals in certain quarters to\r\nimport and dump nuclear waste and other forms of\r\nhazardous waste in our region. I refer specifically to\r\nreported plans afoot by certain unscrupulous nuclear-\r\nwaste dealers to use the Palmyra Islands and certain other\r\nsites in the Pacific as permanent disposal facilities for\r\nnuclear waste.\r\nMy country wishes to make it clear to all concerned\r\nthat we in the Pacific region will not sit idly by and allow\r\nany further reckless and mindless destruction of our\r\nenvironment and detriment to the health of our people\r\nthrough any form of nuclear contamination.\r\nThe stark reality of international affairs in our world\r\ntoday is that total nuclear disarmament and general\r\ndisarmament, or even accelerated movement towards\r\nthose goals, will not end tensions and conflicts and threats\r\nto peace. Even when weapons were made of stone,\r\ntensions, threats to peace and conflicts existed. And when\r\nwe look at the events that are happening at present in a\r\nnumber of countries around us, my country recognizes,\r\nand I am sure we all do, that we must create in our\r\ninternational life a system of preventive diplomacy that\r\ncan respond promptly, positively, peacefully and\r\neffectively to potential conflicts and threats of genocide,\r\nand de-escalate internal tensions and threats to internal\r\nand regional peace. My country wishes to recall its\r\nrecommendation to the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly that earnest and urgent action should be taken\r\nto set up a special United Nations department or unit to\r\npursue preventive diplomacy in conflict prevention and\r\nconflict resolution. The department, in collaboration with\r\ncompetent countries and authorities, should have the\r\ncapacity to receive, collate, analyse and interpret\r\nintelligence information and reports with a view to early\r\ndetection of potential conflicts and early reaction to\r\ncontain, minimize and resolve such conflicts in\r\ncollaboration with relevant Member States. We should\r\ntake every step within our power to prevent fires rather\r\nthan having to put them out, to save lives rather than\r\nhaving to condemn the loss of lives.\r\nAccordingly, my country welcomes the offer made\r\nby Norway in the General Assembly to establish a fund\r\nfor preventive action at the United Nations and that\r\ncountry’s pledge to provide some financial contribution to\r\nthe fund annually.\r\nIn our efforts to promote, establish and maintain\r\npeace and security in our world, it is incumbent upon us\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nto recognize and realize that security has several\r\ndimensions, not the least of which is economic security.\r\nSluggish economic development and limited\r\ndevelopment growth have affected developing countries and\r\nin particular, small island States, threatening national\r\nregional stability in one way or another. My country\r\ntherefore calls on the international community, first, to\r\nincrease official development assistance and to improve the\r\nquality of such assistance to developing countries; secondly,\r\nto cooperate in the creation of a more equitable\r\ninternational economic environment and thereby help to\r\npromote sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, and at the same time, help to eradicate\r\npoverty; thirdly, to dismantle trade barriers and restrictions\r\nto market access; fourthly, to improve the access of\r\ndeveloping countries to capital from international financial\r\ninstitutions and commercial sources; and lastly, to facilitate\r\nand assist the flow of investment capital and appropriate\r\ntechnologies to developing countries.\r\nWe have noted with concern that donor countries have\r\nfailed to comply with the internationally agreed targets of\r\nofficial development assistance and commitments for new\r\nand additional resources. There is urgent need for a\r\nsubstantial expansion of official development assistance and\r\nfor qualitative improvements in official development\r\nassistance by donor countries through a reduced cost of\r\nrepayment. In fact, my country has noted with deep regret\r\nthat while some developed countries have been making\r\nefforts to meet the official development assistance level,\r\nsuch assistance from some rich countries has been declining\r\nnoticeably, and the decline has been taking place in the\r\npost-cold-war era, when it was to be expected that such\r\ncountries were in a better position to increase the flow of\r\nofficial development assistance as a result of greater\r\nstability in the world and reduced tensions between former\r\nantagonists. In fact, in the case of a few traditional donors,\r\naid has almost completely dried up. In some cases, aid is\r\nbeing systematically reduced. It appears that our region is\r\nno longer a strategic area for competition by the former\r\ncold-war antagonists to gain our favour.\r\nMy country is concerned to see the recent trend in\r\nsome countries to seek to impose alien norms on countries\r\nwith a unique, traditional and customary nature of society,\r\nespecially indigenous societies. On the other hand, with\r\nrespect to Japan and some South-East Asian countries such\r\nas Malaysia, development assistance is provided with no\r\nintention of interfering in their internal affairs.\r\nInternational cooperation for development lies at the\r\nvery heart of improving the living conditions of the great\r\nmajority of people in our world who live in developing\r\nand least developed countries. My country fully supports\r\nan Agenda for Development, which is aimed at restoring\r\nthe imperative of development as a central concern. Such\r\nan agenda should contain specific, concrete and pragmatic\r\nproposals that could be translated into action programmes\r\nand implemented on the basis of global priorities.\r\nThe Agreement amending the fourth Lomé\r\nConvention between the countries of Africa, the\r\nCaribbean and the Pacific and the European Community,\r\nsigned in Mauritius on 4 November 1995, includes a\r\nSecond Financial Protocol that ensures that the European\r\nDevelopment Fund will be available for development\r\nprojects in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries up to\r\nthe end of February 2000. This commitment by the\r\nEuropean Union is a direct endorsement of a multilateral\r\naccord and a North-South development instrument that\r\nhas worked and that has been widely acclaimed\r\nthroughout the world. Many critics are predicting the end\r\nof Lomé by the year 2000. However, within the\r\nCommunity itself, and within the 70 African, Caribbean\r\nand Pacific States, the idea of a successor agreement to\r\nLomé IV is a fait accompli. That in itself is a firm and\r\nunambiguous recognition of the dire need for such an\r\ninstrument beyond the year 2000.\r\nIt is therefore our — and indeed everyone’s —\r\nresponsibility to protect and defend the principles and\r\nphilosophy behind an accord such as the Lomé\r\nConvention. Those who are carried along by the\r\nliberalization of the so-called winds of change that are\r\nsweeping through the continents must realize that parts of\r\nour international community will still require preferential\r\narrangements in the interest of economic and political\r\nparity and of equity, peace and stability in the world.\r\nIt is sad to note that the developed countries have so\r\nfar failed to fulfil their commitments to provide new and\r\nadditional financial resources and technology transfer to\r\nthe developing countries on favourable terms. The\r\nimplementation of such commitments is most necessary\r\nfor international economic cooperation, as is meaningful\r\nand effective follow-up to major conferences.\r\nMy country calls for the prompt and full\r\nimplementation of the commitments and recommendations\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED), which are more relevant today\r\nthan ever before. We believe that under UNCED\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\ndeveloping countries should have the right to benefit fully\r\nfrom the utilization of their natural resources if they are to\r\nachieve sustained economic growth and maintain\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe wish to highlight the continuing urgent need to\r\npromote and facilitate industrialization as an instrument to\r\nfacilitate rapid economic and social development in\r\ndeveloping countries, which will contribute to the\r\nelimination of poverty and the generation of productive\r\nemployment. The strengthening of the industrial bases of\r\ndeveloping and least developed countries should become an\r\ninternational imperative.\r\nMy country calls on the international community to\r\nensure an open, rule-based, equitable, secure, non-\r\ndiscriminatory, transparent and predictable multilateral\r\ntrading system with the aim of achieving the complete\r\nintegration of the developing countries into the world\r\neconomy and the new international trading system.\r\nWe call upon Member States to implement fully the\r\ncommitments agreed to in the Final Act adopted by the\r\nWorld Trade Conference, which confers special and\r\ndifferential treatment on developing countries. We believe\r\nthat the carefully balanced package of rights and obligations\r\nwith respect to the World Trade Organization should be\r\ncarefully preserved and that the essential priority should be\r\nthe implementation and fulfilment of such rights and\r\nobligations and the adoption of measures to mitigate\r\nadverse consequences on the developing countries.\r\nThe present unfair trading system is stagnating the\r\neconomies of small island States when the international\r\ncommunity is committed to protecting them. Fiji has\r\nderegulated its economy and its trade system, but we are\r\ndeterred in our efforts to gain access to the markets of\r\nsome developed countries, which still retain regulatory\r\nbarriers of one kind or other.\r\nMy country therefore warmly welcomes the statement\r\nby the British Foreign Minister in this Assembly that the\r\ndeveloped world must demolish the barriers it still\r\nmaintains against imports from the developing world and\r\nthe concomitant commitment to bring a vision of global\r\nfree trade to reality by the year 2020.\r\nIt is sad to note that the debt crisis persists as one of\r\nthe main constraints to development in developing\r\ncountries. We wish to stress the urgent need for the\r\ninternational community, particularly donor countries and\r\ninternational financial institutions, to adopt an effective,\r\ncomprehensive and equitable development-oriented and\r\ndurable solution to the debt problem of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nMy country strongly supports the World Food\r\nSummit to be held at Rome next month. It is the first\r\ntime that world leaders will meet to debate and renew a\r\ncommitment to eradicate hunger and malnutrition and to\r\naddress the issues of food security for all peoples through\r\nthe adoption of policies and actions at the national,\r\nsubregional, regional and international levels.\r\nAs we pursue initiatives on several fronts to promote\r\nand facilitate lasting peace and security in our world, we\r\nhave to be mindful of areas of tension that exist\r\nconcurrently.\r\nThe Washington Middle East peace summit has\r\ncome and gone, but at least it succeeded in bringing\r\ntogether the leader of Israel and the Palestinian leader in\r\ndialogue and discussion. We urge the parties to pursue in\r\na meaningful way the initiative set in motion by the\r\nWashington summit. We also urge continued restraint by\r\nall. Killing and lamentations may have become an\r\nestablished way of life in the region, but peace and\r\npeaceful coexistence are the only civilized way towards\r\nprogress and prosperity for all. We call upon the parties\r\nto undertake genuine and constructive action to negotiate,\r\nachieve and maintain a just and lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe Dayton accords succeeded in bringing a halt to\r\narmed hostilities in war-torn Bosnia. General elections\r\nhave been held, but the situation remains fragile and the\r\nconclusion is inescapable that the international\r\npeacekeeping presence in Bosnia should remain for some\r\ntime to come to consolidate the gains that have been\r\nachieved so far.\r\nRecent events in Cyprus have reminded us that the\r\ntense situation in that country persists, and my country\r\ncontinues to urge all parties to accelerate the pace of the\r\nnegotiations in the interest of finding a constructive, just\r\nand lasting solution as early as possible.\r\nRecent events in the Straits of Taiwan have\r\nhighlighted the tension that exists in that region of the\r\nworld, a region which is otherwise currently witnessing a\r\nmost dynamic economic growth. Both the People’s\r\nRepublic of China and Taiwan, which are also active\r\nparticipants in post-forum dialogue with the island\r\ncountries of the South Pacific Forum, contribute\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nsignificantly to the development of the South Pacific region.\r\nMy country welcomes the spirit of cooperation between\r\nTaiwan and the People’s Republic of China and encourages\r\nthe continuation of such dialogue and cooperation.\r\nThe genocide in Rwanda and Burundi imposes an\r\nobligation on our community of nations to pursue every\r\npossible initiative to prevent tragedies of such magnitude\r\nand to avoid a recurrence whenever and wherever they\r\noccur, and not on a selective basis or to serve the self-\r\ninterest of one or another major Power. The conclusion is\r\ninescapable that such problems should not be left entirely\r\nto regional organizations to resolve, since they may have\r\nneither the capacity nor the resources to deal effectively\r\nwith the situation.\r\nMy county condemns international terrorism and will\r\nfully support all international efforts and measures to\r\neliminate international terrorism. We will also support\r\ninitiatives to negotiate an international agreement to ban the\r\nuse, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel\r\nmines.\r\nWe fully support international efforts in crime\r\nprevention and criminal justice and are fully appreciative of\r\nthe preparatory work being done on the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court.\r\nMy country would like to reemphasize its strong view\r\nthat the question of the protection and security of small\r\nStates should remain a central concern of the United\r\nNations. For as long as drug traffickers, international arms\r\ndealers, money launderers and international white-collar\r\ncriminals continue their criminal activities, and as long as\r\nmercenaries and terrorists exist, small States will remain\r\nvulnerable to acts of aggression from without as well as\r\nfrom within. Small States especially look to the provisions\r\nof the United Nations Charter for the respect and\r\npreservation of their sovereignty.\r\nMy country continues to urge all parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change to\r\nmove speedily towards the conclusion of an effective\r\nprotocol that would ultimately bring about improvements in\r\nthe global climate system. My country is one of the many\r\nthat is vulnerable to rising sea levels, hurricanes and other\r\nphenomena associated with disastrous climate changes. Our\r\nphysical survival could be affected if immediate action is\r\nnot taken to address the problem of climate changes in our\r\nworld. The meeting of the South Pacific Forum held in the\r\nMarshall Islands from 3 to 5 September this year\r\nhighlighted the Forum’s concern that climate change has\r\nbecome a crucial issue within the region. It called — and\r\nwe share that call — for urgent action, particularly in\r\nview of the second assessment report of the\r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which stated\r\nthat the balance of scientific evidence suggested a\r\ndiscernible human influence on the global climate. The\r\nForum welcomed the outcome of the second session of\r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change and called for acceleration\r\nof negotiations on the text of a legally binding protocol or\r\nanother legal instrument to be completed in time for\r\nadoption at the third session of the Conference of Parties\r\nin order to achieve significant progress towards the goal\r\nof lower greenhouse-gas emissions.\r\nThe South Pacific Forum also called upon all\r\ncountries to support the activities of the Ad Hoc Group\r\non the Berlin Mandate and reaffirmed its support for the\r\ninclusion of the draft protocol presented by the Alliance\r\nof Small Island States for consideration in the negotiating\r\nprocess.\r\nMy country warmly welcomes the recent\r\nestablishment of the International Seabed Authority and\r\nthe election of the judges of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea. These new developments, together\r\nwith the successful completion last year of the United\r\nNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, will maintain the momentum in\r\nthe implementation of the Law of the Sea Convention. In\r\nparticular, we support the promotion of the regime for the\r\nsustainable utilization of the living resources of the sea.\r\nIt is our sincere hope that the International Seabed\r\nAuthority will administer the resources of the sea for the\r\nbenefit of mankind. My country calls on the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations, in accordance with\r\nthe decision of the General Assembly taken in July 1994\r\nto provide adequate funding and adequate technical\r\nsupport to the International Seabed Authority so that it\r\ncan competently discharge in a most effective and\r\nefficient manner the responsibilities we gave it under the\r\nConvention. My delegation is pleased to be a sponsor of\r\na draft resolution seeking the granting of observer status\r\nin the United Nations for the International Seabed\r\nAuthority.\r\nThe United Nations has done a remarkable and\r\nexcellent job in carrying out its mandates during the 51\r\nyears of its existence. It has played a significant,\r\ndiscernible and indispensable role in human affairs, from\r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\neconomic development and social progress, from food and\r\nagriculture to employment and labour standards, from\r\nhelping the children of our world to fostering human rights\r\nand justice. The international community is deeply indebted\r\nto the United Nations, which should continue to be a forum\r\nfor multilateral cooperation and not an instrument that\r\nmajor Powers may use to serve their own national self-\r\ninterests. My country acknowledges with profound gratitude\r\nthe assistance and cooperation it has been receiving from\r\nthe United Nations in its national and regional development\r\nefforts. Fiji continues to pledge its commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations and to what it stands for.\r\nIt is appropriate to observe, however, that in order to\r\nrespond to the many demands of this complex world in\r\nwhich we all live, the United Nations has had to expand.\r\nOver a period of years, it has become very heavy, thereby\r\ngreatly increasing the cost of its operation. The unhealthy\r\nstate of United Nations finances does not derive, however,\r\nsolely from the Organization’s enhanced and expanding\r\nstructure. It has also been exacerbated by the non-payment\r\nof dues and assessments. We call on all Member States that\r\nhave not paid their dues or assessments and are in arrears\r\nto pay them promptly, fully and without conditions.\r\nMy country appreciates the steps taken this year by the\r\nUnited Nations administration to improve management, to\r\nmake services more efficient and more effective and to cut\r\ncosts. Notwithstanding the action that has been taken, my\r\ncountry believes that more can and should be done to make\r\nthe Organization leaner and more streamlined and at the\r\nsame time to reduce costs further. The various organs,\r\nagencies and departments of the United Nations need to be\r\nrationalized in line with the modalities of today’s world,\r\nand structural changes and more personnel reforms must be\r\ninstituted to make it more responsive to the constant\r\ndemands of a continuously changing international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy country believes that the scale of assessments for\r\nthe apportionment of expenses should be reassessed to\r\nmake it more equitable and less burdensome for small\r\nisland States.\r\nMy country believes that the time has come for the\r\nreform of the Security Council. We submit, as we did last\r\nyear, that the organs of the United Nations should reflect\r\nchanges in the global political landscape as well as the\r\nprinciples of geographic representation and equity. The\r\nSecurity Council should, in our view, be enlarged to\r\naccommodate the existing global political landscape.\r\nSince peace and security underpin the very\r\nfoundation of this Organization, my country fully supports\r\nthe international peacekeeping missions of the United\r\nNations. We are committed to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and, despite the fact that\r\nwe are a small, developing island State with a small\r\npopulation, we have actively participated in the vast\r\nmajority of United Nations peacekeeping missions. Fijian\r\nsoldiers are serving in the Middle East with both the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the\r\nMultinational Force and Observers, as well as in Iraq and\r\nKuwait. They have served in Afghanistan, Somalia and in\r\nRwanda. Our policemen, too, have served in Angola,\r\nCambodia, Namibia and Iraq, and are currently serving in\r\nEastern Slavonia and in Croatia. Several of our men have\r\nlost their lives in the service of the international\r\ncommunity and in the pursuit of peace and security in our\r\nworld.\r\nPeacekeeping is the responsibility of all Member\r\nStates, whether they contribute troops and personnel or\r\nnot. We therefore urge all countries concerned to expedite\r\nthe settlement of the assessments for peacekeeping due to\r\nthe United Nations. And in turn, we urge the United\r\nNations expeditiously and fully to settle the amounts or\r\narrears outstanding to Member countries for their\r\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations.\r\nAs I stated previously, international security has\r\nmany dimensions. The security of the world’s indigenous\r\npeoples is one such dimension. The history of the world’s\r\nindigenous peoples is replete with wholesale slaughter,\r\ngenocide and, in some cases, total annihilation during the\r\nera of exploration, discovery and colonization.\r\nThe Prime Minister of Fiji, the Honourable Sitiveni\r\nRabuka, told the United Nations last year that it:\r\n“must guarantee that external values and forces do\r\nnot continue to coerce political concessions,\r\neconomic reforms and social changes not desired by\r\nindigenous peoples themselves”. (Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 40th meeting, p. 49)\r\nAt the opening of the regional workshop on the draft\r\nUnited Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous\r\npeoples held in Fiji last month, the Prime Minister of Fiji\r\ndeclared that:\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\n“In our Pacific home, we have been sole proprietors\r\nin most places for no less than three thousand years;\r\nin most other places, for much longer.”\r\nOur Prime Minister stated that it must be legally\r\naccepted that:\r\n“We are the first settlers, first dwellers or proprietors\r\nof our land. Secondly, we are a collective group that\r\nwas imposed upon by uninvited external forces who\r\ndisrupted the normal march of our history. As victims\r\nof what continues to be described as imperialism and\r\ncolonialism, we cannot, in our quest for freedom,\r\nallow the vestiges of foreign domination to encroach\r\nupon us, either through internal machinations or\r\nexternal collusion.”\r\nThe Fiji workshop agreed in principle that, wherever\r\npossible, efforts to strengthen the text of the current draft\r\ndeclaration should be encouraged. The unanimous view of\r\nthe workshop was that efforts by States to undermine the\r\nexisting language of the draft should be actively resisted by\r\nindigenous peoples. The workshop further resolved that\r\nPacific indigenous peoples should seek to promote greater\r\nsupport for the draft declaration within the United Nations\r\nsystem so that the overall objective of achieving an\r\neffective and meaningful declaration on indigenous peoples\r\nis reached.\r\nMy country, which has had a multiracial population\r\nfor the last 150 years, warmly welcomes the observance of\r\nthe International Decade of the World’s Indigenous People.\r\nWe strongly urge, during the International Decade, the\r\nadoption of the declaration on the rights of indigenous\r\npeoples. My country believes that the declaration should not\r\nbe the alpha and the omega of indigenous rights, but should\r\nbe merely a first step towards the negotiation, under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, of a comprehensive legal\r\nconvention on the rights of indigenous peoples.\r\nTension and fears among the indigenous people in Fiji\r\nled to the military overthrow of the Government in 1987\r\nand the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1990 by an\r\ninterim Government. That Constitution provided indigenous\r\nFijians majority representation in Parliament. That\r\nConstitution was reviewed by a three-member commission\r\nheaded by Sir Paul Reeves of New Zealand. After over 12\r\nmonths of review, the commission recently submitted its\r\nreport and recommendations to the Government. The\r\nGovernment has duly submitted the report to Parliament\r\nand a Select Committee, comprising representatives of all\r\nthe political parties in Parliament, has been appointed to\r\nconsider the Commission’s report and recommendations.\r\nLasting peace and security in our world has been an\r\nillusion for the greater part of this century. With the new\r\nglobal changes, with our recent adoption of the CTBT,\r\nwith rising optimism regarding the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, with what can be perceived as a genuine\r\ndesire for peace, and with more meaningful international\r\ncollaboration in the areas of economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment, there is some hope for achieving lasting\r\npeace and security in our world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Planning and Environment of\r\nSeychelles, Her Excellency Mrs. Danielle de St. Jorre.\r\nMrs. de St. Jorre (Seychelles) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The course of history appears to unwind rapidly\r\nand with it, events occur, pass or recede into time,\r\nimbuing the lives of our societies with the dual sensation\r\nof dizzying progress and desperately slow evolution. It is\r\nessential for people to live in harmony and to face, with\r\na feeling of unity, goodwill and sharing, the great\r\nchallenges which they could not overcome alone. That is\r\nwhy we are gathered here. We believe that, without each\r\nother, we are weak and vulnerable and that, in order to\r\nlive better, it is essential that we be able to share and\r\nwork together.\r\nUpon reflection, however, it becomes more and more\r\nclear that some of the countries that are developing more\r\nrapidly, thanks to the advantages of technological and\r\nscientific progress, are losing interest in those still\r\nstruggling to survive and still facing economic difficulties,\r\nfood shortages and problems of health and education. To\r\nall this can be added other, equally serious evils: the\r\neffects of drugs, alcoholism, criminal behaviour and\r\nprostitution in all its forms.\r\nIn our international forums we often speak of\r\nsecurity, of action to combat international terrorism and\r\nof the war on organized crime. Just recently, we were\r\ntalking about working together against paedophilia. These\r\nare such horrible, painful things, but unfortunately so\r\ncharacteristic of our times.\r\nSo how can we not strongly condemn these attacks\r\non human security and dignity? But it is even more\r\nimportant that our rejection of these crimes affecting the\r\nworld be felt with the same degree of intensity, regardless\r\nof the country where they are committed — especially\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nwhen some countries lack the means to combat the crimes.\r\nShould not the spirit of solidarity imply a concern for the\r\nwell-being and security of all the inhabitants of the world?\r\nShould not each and every nation shed its selfish,\r\nhypocritical attitudes?\r\nBy not seeing further than our own interests, we treat\r\nothers as our lowly tools. And yet we are well aware that\r\nfeelings of frustration and injustice are the source of so\r\nmuch violence which so frequently plunges the world into\r\nmourning and makes people fear for their security.\r\nTherefore, if we want to world to develop harmoniously,\r\nwe must break the bonds of this indolent selfishness in\r\nwhich people see everything around them through the prism\r\nof self-satisfaction.\r\nIf the existence of the United Nations is now\r\nthreatened and if serious problems are undermining it and\r\nweakening the international community, it is precisely\r\nbecause the strongest partners will not agree to adopt the\r\nrules that govern any family, in which everyone’s opinions\r\nare heard and discussed and the strong support and help the\r\nweak.\r\nInstead, what do we observe? The most-favoured\r\nnations seem to carry little about and refuse resolutely to\r\naddress the realities handicapping the developing countries.\r\nCalculations, assessments, criteria are separated into\r\ncategories, mechanically, as if nations and peoples can be\r\nreduced to mere statistics. It must be said that the generous\r\nefforts of some rich countries, while helping developing\r\ncountries, also benefit, one way or another, directly and\r\nindirectly, the stingiest countries.\r\nAre we still seeking justice, equality and sustainable\r\ndevelopment throughout the world? In any case, the image\r\nthe world projects of itself does not reflect these ideals, but\r\nrather two poles spinning further and further apart: the pole\r\nof wealth and the pole of poverty. It’s not that there has\r\nbeen a lack of international meetings, at the highest levels,\r\nto try to find more effective solutions to reduce the level of\r\npoverty, increase the equity of trade and so forth. But it\r\nseems that, with each meeting, these problems get worse.\r\nThe firm ground of progress is crumbling under the\r\nfeet of the developing countries and their future — given\r\ntheir current relations with the Powers holding the reins of\r\nthe global economy — seems quite uncertain. This is\r\nespecially true for the small island developing States like\r\nthe Seychelles, whose only resources are the precarious\r\nrevenues of tourism, which is subject to so many\r\nvicissitudes, and fishing. Their meagre resources, pumped\r\ninto a network of tremendous competition, require them\r\nto make titanic efforts. Like many other countries whose\r\nterritories were long exploited by a great Power and then\r\nsuffered the repercussions of being suddenly abandoned\r\nwithout compensation, the Seychelles’ economy is even\r\nmore vulnerable than it was before being buffeted by this\r\nphenomenon.\r\nAs they do every year, many speakers have\r\nunderscored the importance of preserving the environment\r\nin the context of sustainable development. The President\r\nof the United States himself underscored this fact:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“Our planet is safer because of our common efforts\r\nto close Chernobyl, to address the challenges of\r\nclimate change, to protect the world’s forests and\r\noceans. Now we must uphold our duty as custodians\r\nof our environment so that our children will inherit\r\nan even healthier planet.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 6th meeting, p. 14)\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAnd, at the annual meeting of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, United States Vice-President Albert Gore Jr.\r\nalso made this point.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“But it also means giving greater attention to\r\nbroad issues that I firmly believe must shape and\r\ninform everything we do in our quest for equitable\r\nand sustainable global prosperity. The first of these\r\nis a commitment to sustainable development and our\r\nenvironment. We now know with perfect clarity that\r\neconomic development and growth cannot ignore\r\necological realities. We know that investments that\r\ngenuinely reduce poverty in an equitable and\r\nenduring way are investments that take their\r\nenvironmental implications fully into account. Not\r\nonly is such an approach consistent with our\r\ndevelopment objectives, but it will also be much\r\nmore cost effective. Win-win situations are not\r\nalways available, but this is one of them and it is\r\navailable.”\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nAnd yet, many of our countries, although their survival\r\ndepends on the entire world preserving the environment,\r\nfind themselves left by the wayside when certain great\r\nPowers — having no further need of the hospitality of their\r\nshores for their military or other installations — light-\r\nheartedly depart, leaving behind them a trail of debris and\r\nother things and leaving it up to the countries themselves to\r\ndo the rest. As for the damages and costs — let’s not talk\r\nabout them.\r\nAs for the reforms of the institutions of the United\r\nNations system, the Seychelles is in favour of all proposals\r\naimed at improving the representation of the smaller States\r\nin our work. We believe that the international community\r\nmust hear our voices, understand us and deal with the\r\nspecifics of our situation. Furthermore, to be more\r\nobjective, the assessment criteria now being massively\r\napplied to all the developing countries, which require more\r\nfocused attention, should be re-examined in the light of the\r\nvulnerability index. The index is too easily ignored, but is\r\nnonetheless very important in the establishment of the\r\nobjective data defining the profile of any given country.\r\nThe fashion for what is commonly called “democracy”\r\nis sweeping the surface of the earth, and one of the\r\nprincipal criteria which the developed countries —\r\ndemocracy’s self-appointed guarantors — use for deciding\r\neligibility for development assistance is the establishment\r\nof a democratic system. Shouldn’t that respectable\r\ninstitution, democracy, be manifest within the Organization\r\nitself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom\r\nto duly vest its authority? In seeking to impose its logic by\r\none way or another, in seeking to make its choice the\r\nmajority’s choice, we are far from honouring the principle\r\non which democracy is founded: majority rule. In other\r\nwords, for a matter such as the renewal of the mandate of\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, we should better\r\ngauge the pros and cons, leaving aside those which may\r\nseem a little too individualistic. We must be able to accept,\r\nparticularly if qualifications justify it, the choice of the\r\nmajority of the Members of this eminently democratic\r\ninstitution: the United Nations.\r\nTo conclude, I express my best wishes for greater\r\nconcord in the future of the United Nations, which\r\nrepresents the voice and the will of the peoples of the\r\nworld, so that the endeavour to which so much effort and\r\ngenerosity has been devoted may produce decisions and\r\nactions that will create for all the children, women and men\r\nof the Earth a way of life in which relations become more\r\nhumane and thus more conducive to the advent of a\r\nharmonious global society.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ghana, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohamed Ibn Chambas.\r\nMr. Chambas (Ghana): My delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its satisfaction and joy in seeing Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail preside over the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. His unanimous election is an honour to him\r\npersonally and also to his country, Malaysia, with which\r\nGhana has forged very warm and special relations. We\r\nhave no doubt that his sterling qualities and long record\r\nof distinguished service to his Government and the\r\ninternational community will stand him in good stead in\r\nleading this Assembly to a successful conclusion of its\r\nwork.\r\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal, we wish to express our appreciation for the able\r\nmanner in which he led us through very difficult\r\nnegotiations during his presidency.\r\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nhas demonstrated, through his indefatigable energy and\r\ncommitment to the independence and well-being of the\r\nUnited Nations, that he is up to the challenges that lie\r\nahead of us in seeking to revitalize this Organization for\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nIt was only a year ago that we celebrated with\r\nfanfare the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of our\r\nOrganization. The world leaders assembled in this\r\nAssembly at that time once again rededicated themselves\r\nto achieving the visions embodied in the Charter of our\r\nOrganization and fulfilling its goals and objectives, which\r\nserve the largest interests of humanity. We have gathered\r\nhere again this year to take stock of developments since\r\nour last meeting and to renew, through various decisions\r\nand resolutions, our commitment to the promotion of\r\npeace and prosperity for our mutual benefit.\r\nThe end of the cold war provides us with a golden\r\nopportunity to work earnestly in pursuit of the\r\ninternational community’s desire for general and complete\r\ndisarmament — including nuclear disarmament — to be\r\nachieved under effective international control. Through\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nand nuclear-weapon-free zones, most of us non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States are making our contributions in this\r\nrespect. My Government is in the process of ratifying the\r\nPelindaba Treaty, of which we are a proud signatory, and\r\nwe appreciate the support of the non-nuclear and nuclear-\r\nweapon States for that Treaty. However, such zones can\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nonly be given meaning by the nuclear-weapon States’\r\ngenuinely accepting the need for the eventual elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons within a given time-frame. It is with this\r\nin view that my country voted in favour of the adoption of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and signed it,\r\ndespite its shortcomings. We see the Treaty as a first step\r\nin the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.\r\nWe also join the Non-Aligned Movement in urging all\r\nnuclear-weapon States to conclude an international\r\ninstrument that would offer unconditional and legally\r\nbinding assurances to all non-nuclear-weapon States against\r\nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. This will\r\nenable all States subscribing to international instruments on\r\nnon-proliferation to cooperate freely and unconditionally in\r\nthe application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nWe will also continue to urge that more attention be\r\npaid to conventional armaments and to efforts to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation to curtail and eventually prohibit\r\nthe use of anti-personnel land-mines and other inhumane\r\nweapons, which continue to inflict untold damage and\r\nhardship on innocent people long after the conflicts in\r\nwhich they were deployed have ended. Similar attention\r\nshould be given to international cooperation in curbing\r\nillicit transfers of arms. Success in this field will go a long\r\nway towards curtailing the availability of weapons, which\r\nfeed the numerous conflicts we have had to contend with in\r\nrecent years, to drug traffickers and terrorists.\r\nInternal strife within States, nurtured by racial and\r\nreligious intolerance, and the resort to arms for the\r\nsettlement of disputes threaten the very existence of a\r\nnumber of States in diverse regions of the world. In all of\r\nthese States, the intransigence of warlords poses serious\r\nchallenges to the capacity of the international community in\r\ngeneral and the United Nations in particular to meet their\r\nresponsibilities with regard to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We have seen this in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Rwanda,\r\nBurundi, Angola, Liberia and Haiti. The efforts made so far\r\nto deal with these conflicts are laudable, but more needs to\r\nbe done.\r\nThat is what we are doing in West Africa, despite the\r\nrecent setbacks suffered from the attacks on forces of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) in December 1995 and the\r\noutbreak of fighting in Monrovia in April and May 1996.\r\nThough the implementation of the programme for the\r\ndisarmament and demobilization of the fighters, their\r\nreinsertion into normal civil life and the holding of\r\ndemocratic elections in Liberia, as set out in the Abuja\r\nAgreement, are now behind schedule, the meeting of the\r\nECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia, in August 1996\r\nin Abuja, saw the Liberian factional leaders renew once\r\nagain their support for the peace process and their pledges\r\nto cooperate with the efforts to bring the Abuja\r\nAgreement back on track. Thus far we have been able to\r\nrestore the capital, Monrovia, to its status as a safe haven\r\nand reinstate the Council of State and the Liberian\r\nNational Transitional Government. The ceasefire between\r\nthe warring factions in the country has remained largely\r\nrespected, although there are still disturbing reports of\r\nhostilities between some of the factions.\r\nWe do appreciate the assistance of some individual\r\ncountries to ECOMOG, as well as the cooperation of the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, but we wish\r\nto stress once again that these modest forms of support\r\nare grossly inadequate, viewed against the enormity of the\r\ntasks in Liberia and the present state of the economies of\r\nECOWAS member States. The Liberian factional leaders\r\nare tired of the war. The subregion has been able to\r\nbroker peace amongst them, but it lacks the means to\r\nprovide the resources to implement the peace accord. The\r\ninternational community should respond to the call for\r\nresources now or run the risk of the situation deteriorating\r\nonce again. We shall not tire of reminding the\r\ninternational community that this Organization, the\r\nSecurity Council in particular, bears the ultimate\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Regional or subregional efforts like ours can\r\nonly complement, not substitute for, those of the\r\ninternational community, which must face its\r\nresponsibilities more seriously in Liberia.\r\nFor our part, we in Ghana have endeavoured over\r\nthe years to play the role assigned to us within the limits\r\nof our resources in meeting our common responsibilities\r\ntowards the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Since our participation in the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in the Belgian Congo — now\r\nZaire — in the 1960s, Ghana has been present in almost\r\nall the continents where United Nations peacekeeping\r\nduties call, and we are indeed proud of our contribution\r\nto these international peace efforts.\r\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, we\r\ncannot hide our amazement that some people and their\r\nGod-given territories remain under colonial or alien\r\ndomination and foreign occupation. Even more\r\nastonishing is the fact that some otherwise democratic,\r\nadministering countries and colonial Powers fail to\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\nrecognize the inalienable right of the administered or\r\ncolonial peoples to self-determination, and they fail to\r\nrecognize that colonial domination is among the worst\r\nforms of violations of the human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms of colonial peoples.\r\nIt is therefore no accident that we should be gravely\r\nconcerned at the continuing lack of progress on the question\r\nof Western Sahara. Despite all of its shortcomings, the\r\nsettlement plan agreed to by the parties to the Western\r\nSahara problem, under the auspices of this Organization,\r\nremains the best option for pursuing a long-lasting solution\r\nin the interest of the Saharan people. We remain concerned\r\nthat the identification process has had to be suspended and\r\nthe Identification Commission withdrawn as a result of the\r\nfailure of the parties to agree on some relevant important\r\nprocedures and modalities. To break the stalemate, dialogue\r\nis essential, and we once more call on the Assembly to\r\nencourage the principal parties to the conflict to engage,\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, in direct talks that\r\ncan open the way for the continuation of the identification\r\nprocess. Urgent attention and action is required to bring to\r\nan end the present unacceptable situation, which poses a\r\nveritable threat to subregional, regional and wider\r\ninternational security.\r\nIn a similar vein, we take this opportunity to reaffirm\r\nour unflinching support for the Middle East Peace Process\r\ninitiated at the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991 and\r\nculminating in the Oslo accords. Over the past five years,\r\nseveral gains have been made, giving rise to hopes that a\r\njust and comprehensive peace in the region is attainable that\r\nwould take cognizance of the legitimate right to self-\r\ndetermination of the Palestinian people and their right to an\r\nindependent state. We therefore see the recent outbreak of\r\nviolence in the area as a set-back to those laudable efforts\r\nand as a reflection of a growing mistrust on the part of the\r\nparties. We call on them to honour all their commitments\r\nunder the agreements reached and to bring the peace\r\nprocess back on track. In this connection we welcome the\r\nefforts of the United States Administration to bring the\r\nparties together once more.\r\nI should like at this juncture to refer to the question of\r\nthe United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya. The\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the League of Arab\r\nStates and the Non-Aligned Movement, which represent the\r\nvast majority of States and peoples of the world, have been\r\ncalling for some years now for the sanctions on Libya to be\r\nlifted. Our call for dialogue and negotiations that could lead\r\nto an acceptable solution of the dispute between Libya and\r\nthe three permanent members of the Security Council, as\r\nwell as proposals for a fair trial of the two suspects in\r\nThe Hague, by Scottish judges and under Scottish law,\r\nhave not elicited the expected response. Let it not be\r\nconstrued that our calls are based merely on sentimental\r\nconsiderations of regional solidarity. After careful\r\nexamination of the facts as made known to the\r\ninternational community, and with due respect for the\r\ntenets of international law, we think that the three States\r\nconcerned need to reciprocate the flexibility shown by the\r\nLibyan authorities and help to bring to a close an issue\r\nthat has unjustifiably caused untold suffering to the\r\ninnocent people of Libya. Issues of this nature justify our\r\nsupport for the establishment of an international criminal\r\ncourt for the promotion and maintenance of international\r\ncriminal justice on a fair and equitable basis.\r\nThe relics of the cold war in international relations\r\nremain particularly on the Korean peninsula and in United\r\nStates-Cuba relations. We believe that the four-party talks\r\nproposed to ease tension on the Korean peninsula should\r\nfoster dialogue, understanding and cooperation among all\r\nthe countries concerned and enhance the process aimed at\r\nthe eventual unification of the two Koreas. With regard to\r\nUnited States-Cuba relations, we hope that the blockades\r\nand mutual exchanges of rhetoric will give way to a new\r\nera of dialogue and mutual respect, in tune with current\r\ntrends in international relations.\r\nAs has been eloquently stated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his Agenda for Peace, there can be no\r\ndevelopment without peace, just as there can be no peace\r\nwithout development. We are convinced that we need to\r\npursue development as a means of preventing most of the\r\nconflicts, tragedies and humanitarian disasters that\r\nconfront the world today. We are enjoined under the\r\nCharter of the United Nations to\r\n“employ international machinery for the promotion\r\nof the economic and social advancement of all\r\npeoples”.\r\nThe need for concerted international action to restructure\r\nthe international economy; construct a new regime to\r\nguide trade, aid and resource flows; and address the\r\nproblems posed by environmental degradation, population\r\nexplosion, the debt overhang, abject poverty and disease\r\nin developing countries, cannot be overemphasized. Such\r\nmeasures would redress the existing global economic\r\ninequalities and eradicate poverty in a way that will\r\nengender the peace and security that we all so dearly\r\nneed. As expected, the series of global conferences held\r\nrecently under the auspices of the United Nations, which\r\ninvolved not only Governments but also non-\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 October 1996\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society, the media and the\r\nprivate sector, have raised awareness of and built consensus\r\naround a number of overarching issues concerning\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. The time\r\nhas come to shift into implementation gear and invest the\r\nsame political will and energy in the monitoring of the\r\nfollow-up process. We want to safeguard the environment\r\nand the welfare of our children, eradicate poverty, ensure\r\nsustainable development, and mainstream gender concerns\r\nin all our activities at the national and international levels,\r\nso that women and men participate fully and equally in all\r\nspheres of life as we approach the new dawn.\r\nIt bears mentioning that Africa’s socio-economic\r\ndifficulties are further compounded by the twin processes\r\nof globalization and liberalization. Africa therefore needs\r\nthe special attention of the international community to\r\nensure that the profound economic and institutional reforms\r\nit is undertaking to create an enabling environment for\r\ndevelopment yield maximum benefit for its people. The\r\nlaunching of the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative for Africa in March 1996, if fully implemented,\r\nwould contribute meaningfully to this endeavour.\r\nWe are painfully aware that international financial\r\nsupport for Africa is insufficient and unreliable. It is\r\ntherefore necessary for the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) in Africa to focus on the enhancement\r\nand strengthening of Africa’s subregional economic\r\ngroupings, which will serve as building blocks for an\r\nAfrican economic community. This in turn will ensure\r\nAfrica’s effective participation in the emerging global\r\neconomic order that is increasingly being shaped by the\r\nforces of globalization and economic liberalization.\r\nFor our part, we in Ghana are coping, not without\r\ndifficulty, with the challenges posed by these forces,\r\nincluding those that are concomitant with the structural\r\nadjustment programmes that we have pursued for well over\r\na decade. Coupled with these are those other imperatives\r\nthat come with the processes of democratization and good\r\ngovernance. Our democratically elected Government will\r\npresent itself to the electorate on 7 December 1996 to seek\r\na fresh mandate to continue with the policies that have\r\nensured stability and development in our country in recent\r\nyears.\r\nThe entry into force of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea is a welcome development, and we\r\nfully appreciate the numerous efforts and various\r\ncompromises that contributed immensely to putting into\r\nplace the various organs of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority. We hope that adequate resources will be made\r\navailable to enable developing countries to utilize fully the\r\nbenefits, and also discharge the responsibilities, deriving\r\nfrom the Convention.\r\nThe financial situation of our Organization remains\r\nprecarious and a source of concern to my delegation. The\r\ncrunch in the cash-flow situation has not changed for the\r\nbetter, principally because a number of countries,\r\nincluding some of the largest, are neither paying their\r\ncontributions nor making good on their arrears. It is\r\nimportant for Member States to provide the United\r\nNations system with the means and resources required to\r\naccomplish the tasks assigned to it. Support for the\r\nUnited Nations should manifest itself not only in an\r\neagerness to restructure it to make it more effective, but\r\nalso in the payment in full, on time and without\r\nconditions of assessed contributions, in order to promote\r\nthe successful pursuit of the objectives of the\r\nOrganization at a time of both challenge and opportunity.\r\nIn addressing the cash-flow situation, we also wish to\r\ndeplore the high degree of wastage and overlap in the\r\nsystem, especially during the start-up and liquidation\r\nphases of peacekeeping operations as well as in the\r\nproliferation of mandates. With the consolidation of the\r\ninternal oversight mechanisms into the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services, coupled with the existing external\r\noversight mechanisms, it is hoped that the financial\r\nfunctioning of the Organization will be more cost-\r\neffective.\r\nI should like to conclude by reaffirming my\r\ndelegation’s support for the reforms currently being\r\npursued by the United Nations. In our view, the reforms\r\nin the financial administration of the Organization, the\r\nrevitalization of its economic and social structures, the\r\nstrengthening of the General Assembly and the\r\nSecretariat, and the restructuring of the Security Council\r\nall should contribute to a better functioning United\r\nNations suited for the challenges ahead of us as we enter\r\nthe new millennium.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
