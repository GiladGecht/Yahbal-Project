(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Communities of Cape Verde, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amilcar Spencer Lopes, on whom I now\r\ncall.\r\nMr. Lopes (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It is with great\r\npleasure that I convey to you, Mr. President, my\r\ncongratulations on your election to guide the work of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. At the same time I extend\r\ncongratulations to the country that you represent with such\r\ndistinction. Your outstanding qualities guarantee a\r\ncompetent presidency, which will certainly contribute to the\r\nsuccess of our work.\r\nI should also like to express my special appreciation\r\nfor the enlightened and committed leadership of your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, who, in the course of\r\nthe historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly, made\r\nan undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express the highest\r\nappreciation of my delegation for the vision, initiative and\r\ndetermination that have characterized the work of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his\r\npursuit of the noble objectives of our Organization. It is\r\nwith pleasure that I reiterate here the support of my\r\ncountry for his re-election.\r\nCape Verde, being a small developing country that\r\nis particularly affected by drought and desertification, and\r\nwithout any means of defence, has every reason to place\r\na great deal of hope in the success of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly with respect to the fulfilment of the principles\r\nand the goals of its Charter, such as the promotion of\r\npeace and security, social and economic development, the\r\nprotection and defence of the environment, human rights\r\nand international law.\r\nBut small countries are not the only ones looking to\r\nthe United Nations with hope. In today’s world, when\r\ninterdependencies are increasing and globalization is\r\nspreading to a growing number of sectors of humankind’s\r\nactivity, the existence and the work of our Organization\r\nis becoming more and more indispensable to all nations\r\nof the globe.\r\nGovernments are, in fact, more clearly aware of the\r\nneed for international forums in which, through\r\naccommodation, they can reach consensus and decide on\r\nglobal policies, strategies and actions that, increasingly,\r\nare in the interests of the whole planet.\r\nHowever, no institution apart from the United\r\nNations has the vocation or the capacity to respond to\r\nthose needs, since, to a large extent, it is the architect of\r\nthe international stage on which we are players today.\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations many results\r\nhave been achieved in the search for solutions to the\r\nproblems that afflict humankind. Spectacular progress has\r\nallowed human beings to take giant steps in science and\r\ntechnology. Nevertheless, there are still huge challenges to\r\novercome, so that the ideals of the founders of the United\r\nNations may triumph all over the face of the Earth.\r\nIn reality, for many people peace is still a dream, and\r\npromises of the distribution of the dividends from the end\r\nof the cold war have become an illusion. Malnutrition,\r\ndisease, illiteracy — the eternal partners of\r\nunderdevelopment — still overpower nations, preventing\r\nthem from developing to their full potential to the benefit\r\nof their populations. Similarly, in many countries human\r\nrights are flagrantly violated, women are marginalized, and\r\nchildren fall victim to maltreatment and exploitation. In\r\nother countries, ethnic groups are subject to persecution and\r\nsystematic “cleansing”.\r\nAt the same time, situations of tension, such as arms\r\nand drug trafficking, the internationalization of organized\r\ncrime and an upsurge in terrorism, are becoming\r\ngeneralized.\r\nBut it is necessary to bear in mind that such\r\nphenomena, both because of their origin and impact, can be\r\nfought efficiently only if there is a firm, unequivocal\r\ncommitment by all States to improve international\r\ncooperation and better utilize resources within the\r\nframework of the United Nations.\r\nCape Verde, due to its proximity to the Sahara desert,\r\nis particularly affected by ecological problems, since, like\r\nother countries of the Sahel, it faces continuous\r\nenvironmental degradation, which threatens the very\r\nsurvival of its population.\r\nIt is therefore natural for us to welcome with joy the\r\nadoption and entry into force of the United Nations\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nParticularly in Africa, in particular its Regional\r\nImplementation Annex for Africa. The particular attention\r\npaid to Africa is clearly justified. This continent is, without\r\nthe shadow of a doubt, the most affected by drought and\r\nthe most threatened by the advance of desertification. The\r\necological balance of the African continent, one fourth of\r\nthe area of the planet, is crucial to stabilize the environment\r\nas a whole.\r\nFor that reason, the efforts that need to be made to\r\nprevent the desert from spreading must be shared by the\r\nentire international community.\r\nCape Verde is therefore committed, together with\r\nother countries, to establishing an international mechanism\r\nwith the aim of facilitating the implementation and\r\nfinancing of the projects and programmes of the\r\naforementioned Convention. We stress the praiseworthy\r\naction, at the subregional level, of the Permanent Inter-\r\nState Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel in\r\ncoordinating efforts to fight drought and desertification.\r\nI should also like to underline the significant efforts\r\nmade in this area at the national level in Cape Verde. The\r\nreforestation programme launched in the first years of my\r\ncountry’s independence continues with the same vigour\r\n20 years later, and the results achieved are encouraging.\r\nSince the programme was launched, the area covered has\r\ngone from 7,413 to nearly 181,275 acres. I must also\r\nhighlight the major support given by Cape Verde’s\r\ndevelopment partners, without which it would not be\r\npossible to maintain the reforestation programme at its\r\ncurrent pace, which is satisfactory to all.\r\nIn spite of the success of this programme and of the\r\nefforts made, my country is still affected by the\r\ndevastating consequences of drought. In fact, due to the\r\nlack of rainfall in July and the insufficient rain last\r\nAugust and September, Cape Verde faces a year of crop\r\nfailure, which, once again, has given rise to anxiety and\r\ndistress among Cape Verde’s farmers.\r\nTherefore, my Government will be forced, once\r\nagain, to make an unexpected effort to address the\r\nconsequences of such a situation, which, of course, will\r\nhave a negative impact on the development process.\r\nWe therefore urge international solidarity with the\r\npeople and Government of Cape Verde to help our\r\ncountry overcome the current farming crisis and ensure\r\nemployment in the rural areas.\r\nThe world is seeing the gap widen between\r\nindustrialized countries and developing countries.\r\nEconomic globalization and the development of\r\ninformation and communications technology highlight\r\nexisting differences. Restrictive immigration policies,\r\nwhich are associated with the spread of racism and\r\nxenophobia, are gathering speed day by day, which is\r\ndisturbing to us.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nMeanwhile, developing countries and, in particular, the\r\nleast developed, face the consequences of accelerated\r\npopulation growth, which has direct repercussions on\r\nunemployment.\r\nThe pursuit of full employment should be the top\r\npriority of social and economic policies aimed at bringing\r\nabout development in order to provide all — men and\r\nwomen — with the chance to ensure that their means of\r\nsubsistence are secure and long-lasting. Unfortunately, the\r\ninternational community is still reluctant to assume its\r\nresponsibilities in such matters.\r\nA heavy burden thus falls upon the developing\r\ncountries — the task of recovering from the delays\r\nresulting from an economic order that has not been, and\r\nstill is not, in their favour.\r\nThis burden is even heavier in view of the inexorable\r\ntrend towards the reduction of financial flows to the least\r\ndeveloped countries, both in official development assistance\r\nand foreign direct investment.\r\nIn this regard, the Agenda for Development, aimed at\r\nsupporting those countries in their efforts for recovery,\r\nshould make urgent demands with regard to international\r\ncooperation for development. It should, at the same time,\r\nreaffirm the right to development as a main concern of the\r\ninternational community. The Agenda for Development\r\ncannot be seen as a mere enunciation of principles, but\r\nshould be taken as a true charter of social and economic\r\ngoals, with the United Nations playing a key role in its\r\npromotion and materialization.\r\nIn order to prepare the United Nations for the\r\nchallenges facing humankind as we approach the end of the\r\ncentury, we are committed to improving of the Organization\r\nby promoting and undertaking reforms with the aim of\r\nstrengthening it and empowering it so that it is better able\r\nto fulfil the objectives of its Charter. There have been long\r\nand complex negotiations on the reform and restructuring\r\nof the United Nations system. This exercise has been\r\ncharacterized by its particular intensity and richness, aimed\r\nat adapting the institutions of our Organization to the new\r\nchallenges that face humankind as we approach the end of\r\nthe century.\r\nBut we are close to the time when decisions of the\r\nutmost importance to the future of the United Nations will\r\nhave to be taken. They will have to correspond, with due\r\nbalance, to the concerns of large and small countries. What\r\nwill certainly not be acceptable is a situation in which\r\nreforms end up maintaining the differences that already\r\nexist today. We support the idea that reforms should\r\nreflect the deep changes that have taken place in the 50\r\nyears since the creation of the United Nations. There must\r\nbe fair representation for all regions of the world in the\r\ndecision-making bodies of the United Nations, particularly\r\nin the Security Council. In this regard, we recognize the\r\nneed for Africa to be duly represented, namely with\r\nAfrican countries as permanent members of the Council.\r\nWe have all witnessed the successes, however\r\nrelative, of the difficult talks on nuclear disarmament, in\r\nparticular the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the very\r\nrecent adoption by the General Assembly of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which I had the\r\nhonour and pleasure to sign on behalf of my country on\r\n2 October 1996. We believe that these two documents\r\nprovide a historic opportunity and a powerful impetus for\r\nthe creation of conditions that will allow us to look with\r\nhope to the possibility, one day, of a world free of all\r\nnuclear weapons and of the nightmare of their use. The\r\nprocess of nuclear disarmament should, from now on,\r\ngain greater attention and follow-up.\r\nThe signature in Cairo, on 11 April, of the Pelindaba\r\nTreaty, which is the conclusion of joint efforts made by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity and the United Nations,\r\nmarked the solemn pledge of the Governments and\r\npeoples of Africa to assume their share of the task of\r\nridding the continent and the planet of nuclear weapons,\r\nin the same way as did the Governments of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean in 1967, and those of the\r\nSouth Pacific in 1985.\r\nCape Verde, which has consistently supported all\r\nefforts aimed at banning weapons of mass destruction,\r\ncannot but congratulate itself on the strengthening of\r\ninternational stability and security.\r\nExpectations were therefore raised in respect of the\r\nplanned fourth special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to disarmament. We note that its mandate will be\r\ndefined in the course of this session. We hope the special\r\nsession will become a landmark in the creation of an\r\natmosphere of relief and trust that will help us to reach\r\nthe goal of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and\r\nreducing conventional armaments.\r\nA combination of historical, political, economic and\r\nclimatic factors, among others, have given Africa the\r\nlowest level of development of any continent over the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\npast three decades. Social and economic indicators are still\r\nnegative, as are Africa’s prospects for the future.\r\nApproximately 50 per cent of the population of our\r\ncontinent lives in a state of absolute poverty and that\r\npercentage will surely increase if quick and efficient\r\nsolutions are not found to resolve this crisis. At the same\r\ntime, as cause and consequence of this appalling scenario,\r\nwe have witnessed a succession of bloody conflicts,\r\nbringing even greater poverty, disease and the degradation\r\nor even destruction of the environment.\r\nFor this reason, so many important resources and\r\ncapabilities that are essential to assessing and resolving the\r\ncomplex issues of development are being wasted and, very\r\noften, forever lost on the battlefields.\r\nBut it is not only the countries directly involved in\r\nsuch conflicts that suffer the consequences. The tension\r\nbrought about by the presence of armed groups across the\r\nborders of other States, the tragedy of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries\r\nand very often the consequent destruction of the\r\nenvironment, the spread of disease, the degeneration of\r\nmoral values, the horror of suffering and behaviours far\r\nremoved from human values are all situations not confined\r\nto the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur.\r\nIt is therefore with deep sorrow that we witness the\r\nnever-ending armed conflicts on our continent, despite the\r\nefforts of both the African and the international\r\ncommunities to put an end to them. Even when the parties\r\ninvolved seem to have reached an agreement for the re-\r\nestablishment of peace, there are unjustified reversals that\r\njeopardize the entire process.\r\nAn example of this is the conflict that still exists in\r\nAngola, a country with which Cape Verde has deep ties not\r\nonly of history and culture, but also of solidarity. We\r\nsupport the efforts of the Angolan Government and the\r\ninternational community to undertake all tasks aimed at\r\nbringing about a lasting peace, social stability and the\r\nnormal functioning of institutions at the national level,\r\nwithout which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoy\r\nthe tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth they\r\ncould and should benefit from, given the huge potential of\r\ntheir country.\r\nThe need for joint action to end the nightmare of war\r\nin several regions of the African continent is becoming\r\nmore and more urgent. The creation of the OAU\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution was a far-sighted decision giving our continent\r\nthe autonomous ability to help resolve situations of\r\nviolence and tension.\r\nNevertheless, it is important to stress that, in keeping\r\nwith the principles that are at the foundation of that\r\nMechanism, its main aim is anticipation and prevention of\r\nconflicts. Peacekeeping and security in the world remain\r\nthe primary responsibility of the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil, though there may be a justification in some\r\nsituations for the involvement of the OAU in specific\r\npeacekeeping and observer missions.\r\nAddressing the causes of the conflicts, however,\r\nremains the most important issue. These causes are to be\r\nfound essentially in the conditions of underdevelopment\r\nthat persist in most of our countries. Such conditions\r\nnurture the seeds of violence and intolerance, are at the\r\nroot of armed conflicts and block the establishment of\r\nstructures to ensure democratic participation and its\r\nresulting human rights benefits. Key elements for the\r\nattainment of peace in Africa are therefore the promotion\r\nof lasting development, investment in human resources\r\nand ensuring that current processes of democratization are\r\nsuccessful and widespread. It is imperative that such\r\nprocesses be duly supported so that they can consolidate\r\nand improve the living conditions of the population and\r\nstand up to possible coups de force or other such threats.\r\nThe promotion and use of dialogue must be employed to\r\nresolve situations of civil strife and armed conflict.\r\nIn the light of the dimension and scale of the\r\nproblem of development in Africa and questions of\r\nsecurity, we agree with the argument that Africa is\r\ncurrently the major challenge facing the United Nations.\r\nDevelopment, security and peace are major concerns in\r\nthe minds of the leaders of the continent and of all others\r\ninterested in the future of Africa. These goals are\r\ninterrelated and cannot be achieved separately.\r\nOf all the factors limiting the achievement of such\r\nobjectives, the reduction of poverty is undoubtedly the\r\none that must first be overcome through a strategy of\r\nsustainable development. Without this, the remaining\r\neconomic and social goals cannot be achieved. The\r\npersistence of poverty is a constant threat not only to\r\neconomic development, but also to the political and social\r\nstability of States and to the preservation of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nAnother fact to bear in mind is that solutions for the\r\nproblems of development in Africa should be designed\r\nand managed on our own continent, thus making\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nresponsibility for Africa dependent on the development of\r\nthe countries thereof. In this context, Africa is currently\r\ndeeply committed to the search for internal and lasting\r\nsolutions to its problems, which in no way suggests a\r\nrejection of the technological and financial resources and\r\ncontributions that we believe the international community\r\nshould continue to make available so that we can overcome\r\nthe major difficulties we still face.\r\nAfrican countries are fully aware that they must take\r\ntheir destiny into their own hands and have been trying to\r\nimplement measures that reflect their seriousness and hence\r\nworthiness to receive support in order to produce the\r\nexpected results.\r\nSeveral African countries have been undertaking\r\ninstitutional reforms with the aim of opening up their\r\nmarkets, reducing the role of the State in the economy and\r\nstrengthening the private sector in order to make it credible\r\nand able to generate employment. Such reforms, combined\r\nwith democracy and the development of civil society, tend\r\nto promote social and economic stability, thereby\r\nmarshalling internal resources and encouraging foreign\r\ninvestment.\r\nIn this context, we must stress the importance of\r\ninitiatives to promote greater foreign private investment, a\r\nsource of employment and added value which is\r\nfundamental to ensuring the continuous and stable growth\r\nof African economies.\r\nAnother important initiative in which Africa is\r\nengaged is the African Economic Community, which\r\nreceived a decisive boost in May 1994 when the Abuja\r\nTreaty entered into force. As a first step in its\r\nimplementation, the African countries are engaged in\r\nstrengthening the regional integration of their economies\r\nthrough regional economic communities.\r\nLast year, the Organization of African Unity adopted\r\nthe Cairo Plan of Action to give new impetus to the\r\neconomic and social development of Africa. Its\r\nobjectives — responsible management, food security,\r\ndevelopment of human resources, the proper and effective\r\nuse of natural resources, cooperation and economic regional\r\nintegration — are ambitious but feasible. They depend upon\r\nthe political will of Governments and their ability to\r\nmarshal the internal means and external support to achieve\r\nthese objectives. Mention should be made in this regard to\r\nthe principles set out in the important decisions adopted or\r\nbeing prepared by the United Nations: the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\nand the Agenda for Development.\r\nThe Cairo Plan of Action also recalls the need for\r\nthe adoption of measures limiting the negative impact of\r\nthe Uruguay Round agreements on the development of\r\nAfrica in general and of the least developed countries in\r\nparticular, and urges creditors to be prepared to assist in\r\nfinding ways to reduce the debt burden, particularly as\r\nregards the current levels of debt servicing.\r\nThe recent mid-term review of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda was an opportunity for the international\r\ncommunity to renew its commitment to measures aimed\r\nat adding new impetus to implementation, particularly as\r\nregards external debt, the diversification of African\r\neconomies, greater access to markets and the transfer of\r\ntechnology. Africa sincerely hopes that that commitment,\r\nfreely entered into by its partners, will be promptly\r\nfulfilled.\r\nAlthough the current situation tends to raise very\r\nserious concerns, it is nonetheless possible to find\r\nencouraging signs pointing to positive developments in\r\nthe situation on the African continent from the point of\r\nview of economic growth and the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy. And these are more than mere signs; some\r\nexamples of clear successes already visible in Africa in\r\nrecent years show that it is not heading exclusively\r\ntowards chaos and destruction. It is necessary to find\r\nappropriate policies to manage these positive signs,\r\npolicies which we must be courageous enough to\r\nimplement. We are certain such actions will achieve\r\nresults.\r\nAlthough the signs are positive, they still do not\r\nreflect an irreversible trend. The burden of dependency\r\nresulting from past policies is still too heavy for Africa to\r\nreverse the situation on its own. Now more than ever, the\r\ninternational community, specialized agencies and the\r\nindustrialized countries that are friends of Africa are\r\ncalled upon to strengthen financial and technical\r\nassistance to the continent so that underdevelopment can\r\nbe definitively overcome.\r\nIn this regard, we congratulate certain countries on\r\ntheir willingness to maintain their levels of cooperation\r\nwith Africa. Cape Verde is also pleased to note the efforts\r\nand generosity of certain partners, including some from\r\nthe South, on behalf of the development of our country.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nCape Verde does not expect to be solely a beneficiary\r\nof the actions and initiatives of the United Nations. Despite\r\nits limitations and the fragility of its economy, my country\r\nwishes to contribute to the search for solutions to problems\r\ndemanding our attention and to participate in those actions\r\nin which our presence is necessary.\r\nDespite its brief history as an independent country,\r\nCape Verde has several times had an opportunity to play a\r\npositive role in processes involving other countries, either\r\ncontributing to the dialogue and understanding between the\r\nparties involved or through participation in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nIt is the understanding of the Government of Cape\r\nVerde that, despite the structural difficulties it faces, it is\r\nduty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful\r\ninternational environment and a partnership of solidarity\r\nthat will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from\r\nmankind’s scientific and technical achievements and to\r\nimprove social management in order to guarantee each\r\ncitizen internationally recognized basic rights associated\r\nwith the values of freedom, democracy, development and\r\nwell-being.\r\nIn this regard, we must recall here the suffering of the\r\npeople of East Timor, deprived of the right to exercise self-\r\ndetermination and subjugated to a foreign military\r\noccupation for over 20 years. We note with admiration the\r\nresilience of the courageous Maubère people, who have lost\r\nso many of their sons to the cause of freedom. In this\r\nforum, where so much has been done to support the right\r\nof colonial peoples to decide their own destinies, we join\r\nour voice to those demanding the restitution of legality in\r\nthat territory and that the Timorese people be given the full\r\nexercise of their rights, including the right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nIn this same context, we cannot remain indifferent to\r\nthe recent events in the Middle East. They show clearly that\r\nthere is no alternative to the peace process and that\r\ndialogue, tolerance and common sense must prevail over\r\nforce, violence and intolerance, failing which the region\r\ncould well be plunged anew into chaos and destruction,\r\nthus delaying once again the hope of its peoples to live in\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe eyes and hopes of mankind are turned to the\r\nUnited Nations. We are convinced that our Organization\r\nwill emerge from this session with renewed strength and\r\nwith new actions and initiatives that will enable us to look\r\nconfidently to the challenges that the dawn of the third\r\nmillennium holds for all Governments and peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign and Political Affairs of San Marino, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Gabriele Gatti.\r\nMr. Gatti (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): On behalf of the\r\nRepublic of San Marino and my delegation, I wish, first\r\nof all, to congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfirst session. This is a recognition of your competence\r\nand gifts as a diplomat and thus a guarantee of success\r\nfor our activities.\r\nAt the same time, let me also thank your predecessor\r\nfor the excellent way in which he guided the work of the\r\nfiftieth session, just concluded.\r\nWe are all aware that the United Nations rests upon\r\na community of States. Similarly, we are all aware that\r\nthe very existence and future of any State depends on the\r\nindividuals who not only comprise it but also determine\r\nits life and shape its history.\r\nThe United Nations, therefore, must understand and\r\nmeet the needs of all human beings if it is to represent\r\nthe entire family of Member States, protect their interests\r\nand fulfil the legitimate expectations of the largest\r\npossible number of individuals.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nPresently, humanity is confronted with the challenges\r\nof development versus underdevelopment, progress versus\r\nrecession, wealth versus extreme and ever-increasing\r\npoverty. These phenomena affect less-favoured and\r\nsocially advanced countries alike, leading to social\r\ndiscrepancies and situations in which some manage to\r\nplan their own development, while others, deprived of job\r\nopportunities, fail.\r\nDevelopment issues are inextricably intertwined with\r\nthe destiny of nations. They change the face of countries\r\nand peoples and exacerbate the pressures on the less-\r\nfavoured and most populous regions of the world. This is\r\na real and constant threat to peace.\r\nIn some cases, the situation is aggravated by the\r\nfragility or, even worse, lack of democratic institutions.\r\nHere, power is wielded as an end in itself and not as an\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\ninstrument for achieving the common ideal. Societies and\r\nStates tend to withdraw into themselves, their only concern\r\nbeing to retain their strength and power. Sometimes those\r\nwho hold the power do not bother to meet the needs of a\r\nrapidly changing society, except when forced to preserve\r\nthe necessary consensus.\r\nOur Organization should spare no effort to help\r\ncountries and peoples alike to redress the balance and\r\nremedy these errors.\r\nThe items on the agenda for discussion at the fifty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly are of paramount\r\nimportance and deserve the utmost attention and impartial\r\nand thorough analysis, since they pertain, on the one hand,\r\nto the peaceful coexistence of peoples and, on the other, to\r\nthe existence and the structure of the Organization itself.\r\nUltimately, peace and coexistence depend on and are best\r\ngoverned by this institution.\r\nAll efforts must be pooled to improve, update and\r\nrender the United Nations more effective. This objective\r\ncan be achieved through a reform of the system inspired by\r\nequality, justice and wider democracy and aimed at\r\nensuring broader participation and the fair sharing of duties\r\nand powers among all Member States.\r\nSan Marino pledges itself to fulfilling the tasks derived\r\nfrom its United Nations membership, while benefitting from\r\nthe opportunity to participate actively and make its\r\ncontribution to the various bodies of the United Nations.\r\nUndoubtedly, the strengthening and enhancing of the\r\nUnited Nations require a review of the composition, role,\r\nfunctioning and powers of the Security Council. This\r\nreview process, however, is proceeding very slowly and at\r\ntimes reveals inadequate understanding, cooperation and\r\nacceptance of the views of others.\r\nWe are convinced that the Security Council must\r\nadjust to the changes brought about by historical events\r\nand, consequently, to the expanded membership of the\r\nUnited Nations itself, whose character and essence are\r\nclearly becoming increasingly universal. San Marino\r\nbelieves that the Security Council must increase its\r\nmembership, since, as it stands today, it no longer reflects\r\nthe world’s reality, nor does it promote a rotating system in\r\nwhich all States, irrespective of their size, are equally\r\nrepresented and can participate and make their own\r\ncontributions.\r\nAs regards the decision-making process of the\r\nSecurity Council, we believe that the maintenance,\r\nexercise and potential extension of the right of veto must\r\nbe carefully reconsidered. Fortunately, we are living in an\r\nera characterized by dialogue, debate, discussion,\r\nproposals and the search for joint solutions. These are the\r\ninstruments which we should resort to, rather than the\r\nright of veto. Over 50 years of activity and progress allow\r\nand entitle us to reconsider other instruments that, having\r\nproved useful in dealing with initial difficulties and tragic\r\nsituations, are no longer necessary for further growth and\r\nconsolidation.\r\nLastly, special attention should be paid to the\r\ndevelopment and interpretation of the Security Council’s\r\nrules of procedure, with a view to adopting a more open\r\nattitude and a larger involvement of States in discussing\r\nthe issues at stake. In this context, let me call on all\r\nMember States to intensify their efforts to find a\r\nuniversally acceptable solution.\r\nIs this all mere utopia? If it is, then we must not\r\nforget that those who have committed themselves to\r\nserving their countries and the international community\r\nhave a duty to translate this utopia rationally into a\r\npolitical design, without neglecting or ignoring other\r\npeople’s expectations. Only in this way will that utopia\r\nbecome a real political design based on the principles of\r\nresponsibility, equality and justice.\r\nI wish to express the deepest satisfaction of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino at the\r\nadoption of the resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty, which my country cosponsored. Today,\r\nI have the honour of signing this Treaty on behalf of my\r\ncountry. We hope that all States will become loyal Parties\r\nto the Treaty and cooperate in the elimination of nuclear\r\nenergy for non-peaceful uses, so that future generations\r\nmay inherit an environmentally sound planet.\r\nGiven its geographical location in Europe, San\r\nMarino is particularly attentive to the evolution of the\r\npeace process in the Mediterranean area, especially in the\r\nMiddle East, where the earlier general enthusiasm has\r\nbeen overshadowed by disenchantment and frequent\r\ndifficulties. Fortunately, hope, however weak and volatile,\r\nis still alive. The Middle East still needs the international\r\ncommunity’s commitment and encouragement to proceed\r\nto a peaceful settlement of long-standing and more recent\r\ndisputes that are the cause of division and uncertainty.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nIn the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I stressed, on behalf of the Government\r\nof San Marino, the need to reconsider the instrument of the\r\nembargo, its effectiveness and repercussions, especially in\r\nthose cases where, in the absence of armed conflict,\r\ninternational isolation alone has proved a valid moral and\r\npolitical means of international pressure. In this regard, it\r\nis with satisfaction that I note that the elimination of\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political\r\ncompulsion has been placed on this session’s agenda. The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino is confident\r\nthat the debate will lead to a proper examination and\r\nresolution of the problem, so that innocent people who are\r\nalready suffering are no longer the main targets of these\r\nmeasures.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino firmly believes that the\r\nUnited Nations, like the Council of Europe and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, must\r\nremain the most appropriate forum for producing concrete\r\nresults and enhancing the mechanism of fruitful dialogue\r\nand the exchange of ideas. The most daunting challenge is\r\nstill that of preserving future generations from the scourge\r\nof war by reaffirming human dignity and promoting free\r\nand equitable social progress.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs of Jordan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Khaled Madadha.\r\nMr. Madadha (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nPermit me at the outset, Sir, to extend warm congratulations\r\nto Mr. Razali on the confidence shown in him by the\r\ninternational community in electing him President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. I take this\r\nopportunity to extend my best wishes to him and to the\r\nother members of the Bureau for success in directing the\r\nmeetings of this session and in all endeavours to strengthen\r\nour Organization and promote peace in our world. I also\r\ncongratulate Mr. Razali’s friendly country, Malaysia.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express my thanks and\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, and\r\nthe former members of the Bureau for their effective\r\nstewardship of the fiftieth session.\r\nI also wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the dedicated\r\nefforts he has sincerely and honestly made to advance the\r\nOrganization and to promote its humanitarian mission of\r\nsettling disputes between States by peaceful means. In\r\nconformity with the decision of the League of Arab States,\r\nJordan supports the extension of the Secretary-General’s\r\nmandate for another term, in order to enable him to\r\npursue his mission and efforts in the service of\r\ninternational peace and security and the reforms he has\r\ninitiated in the organs and Secretariat of the Organization.\r\nThe role of the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies in the protection of international peace and\r\nsecurity and in enhancing and directing the world\r\neconomy towards liberalization and integration are among\r\nthe main reasons for my country’s devotion to the\r\nOrganization and adherence to its Charter. In view of this,\r\nand out of our sense of responsibility and concern for the\r\nefficiency and relevance of the Organization, we appeal\r\nto all Member States to continue to support it, to fulfil\r\ntheir obligations to it consistently and to work to resolve\r\nits financial crisis.\r\nI assert my country’s firm position on the need to\r\nimplement the necessary administrative reforms and\r\nrestructure the Security Council. The structure of the\r\nCouncil no longer reflects the current balance of power.\r\nAny expansion of the permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil should take into account the increase in the\r\nnumber of developing countries and the growing\r\neconomic power of certain industrial nations, such as\r\nGermany and Japan. We have seen many plans and\r\nproposals on this matter which the Security Council\r\nshould carefully consider, such as the Italian plan. A\r\nreview of the veto power enjoyed by the permanent\r\nmembers should reflect the democracy and transparency\r\nwe seek.\r\nIn this context, I must emphasize the need to review\r\nthe question of economic sanctions, which neither\r\ndistinguish between a political entity and its innocent\r\nunarmed civilian population, nor provide compensation to\r\nthird States adversely affected by such sanctions. We\r\nmust work together to create a durable formula. We also\r\ncall for opening the membership of the United Nations to\r\nall peace-loving States, as stipulated in Article 4.1 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nThis international Organization has made worthy\r\npeacekeeping efforts in many countries. It has made\r\nhuman sacrifices that would be unfair and unwise to\r\nignore. Jordan is very proud to have been among the first\r\ncountries participating in the peacekeeping forces in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and elsewhere. In this regard, my\r\ncountry’s effective participation in the Implementation\r\nForce’s peacekeeping and peacemaking operation in\r\nBosnia is noteworthy.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nIn this regard, the fraternal people of Bosnia must be\r\ncongratulated on the Dayton Agreement and on the\r\nelections it has held. A special tribute should be paid to\r\nPresident Alija Izetbegović for winning the presidential\r\nelection. We are ready, along with other peace-loving\r\ncountries, to help the people of Bosnia make the new\r\ndemocratic experiment a success, consolidate and rebuild\r\nthe federal State and promote its reconstruction,\r\ndevelopment, sovereignty and stability.\r\nBefore I move on to another international issue, I\r\nwould like to congratulate the United Nations on opening\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for signature.\r\nMy country is proud to have been among the first countries\r\nto sponsor the draft resolution under which this Treaty was\r\nadopted and to have signed it. We hope that steps towards\r\nnuclear disarmament will continue and will encompass the\r\nMiddle East region. We hope that negotiations will begin\r\nfor the conclusion of a treaty in the very near future\r\nbanning the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nnuclear and otherwise, so that a nuclear-weapon-free zone\r\nmay be established in the Middle East.\r\nThe peoples of our region have suffered the agonies of\r\ndevastating wars over the past five decades, wars which\r\nhave caused the deaths of tens of thousands, destroyed\r\nbasic infrastructures and brought the people of our countries\r\nbloodshed, pain, deprivation, poverty and instability. Due to\r\nthe allocation of resources to the war machine and the\r\nterrible arms race, their economies have gone into\r\nrecession.\r\nSigns of hope, however, emerged for these people five\r\nyears ago with the Madrid Peace Conference in October\r\n1991 and the subsequent bilateral and multilateral\r\nnegotiations between Arabs and Israelis. Palestinian hopes\r\nwere revived with the 1993 Oslo agreement. The\r\nDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\r\nArrangements that followed restored happiness and hope to\r\nmillions of Palestinians, who saw in that agreement the\r\nbeginning of the end of their pain, bloodshed and destroyed\r\neconomy. They were newly optimistic about securing their\r\nright to self-determination within their own State, rebuilding\r\ntheir national economy, industry and infrastructure, which\r\nhad been destroyed by wars, and the onset of peaceful trade\r\nrelations with their neighbours in Jordan, Israel and other\r\ncountries of the region. Hope was also rekindled by the\r\npeace treaty concluded between Jordan and Israel in\r\nOctober 1994 and the resulting bilateral agreements on the\r\nestablishment of diplomatic and economic relations,\r\nbilateral and regional cooperation, the reconstruction of the\r\nregion and the establishment of strong trade and economic\r\nrelations between the two countries, to the benefit of their\r\npeoples and other peoples in the region, opening the way\r\nto comprehensive regional cooperation.\r\nConcrete progress was also made on the Syrian-\r\nIsraeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace tracks. There were\r\nprospects for a Syrian-Israeli agreement based on the\r\n“land-for-peace” principle, providing for full Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the Golan in return for a peace\r\nagreement ending the state of war and paving the way for\r\npeaceful relations based on strong foundations of\r\nunderstanding and normal, peaceful coexistence.\r\nCurrent events and negative factors and measures in\r\nthe occupied Arab territories — a return to the settlement-\r\nbuilding policy; the violation of the sanctity of the holy\r\nplaces; the closure of the territories; the denial of work\r\nopportunities; the refusal to implement the agreements\r\nsigned on the Palestinian-Israeli track; the postponement\r\nand impediment of self-government negotiations; the\r\nunilateral determination of the status of Jerusalem and of\r\nthe self-government negotiations; the refusal to resume\r\nnegotiations, suspended seven months ago, with Syria and\r\nLebanon; and the refusal to return to the terms of\r\nreference and framework of the Madrid Peace\r\nConference — have given rise to frustration among the\r\npeoples of the region, who are beginning to lose the\r\nrekindled hope to which I have referred.\r\nDespite the excessively negative slogans against\r\npeace used by the new Israeli Government during the\r\nelectoral campaign, we in Jordan — the King, the\r\nleadership and the people — welcomed the new\r\nAdministration and the newly-elected Prime Minister out\r\nof respect for the free will of the Israeli people and non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs. We called for the\r\ncontinuation of the comprehensive peace process in the\r\nregion and pledged to utilize the peace treaty with Israel\r\nto establish such a comprehensive peace. We urged our\r\nneighbours, Syria and Lebanon, to deal with the new\r\nrealities and the new Israeli Government positively and\r\nrealistically. Our motto and position at the Arab Summit\r\nConference held at Cairo last June was a call to extend\r\nmore time and opportunity to the new Israeli Government\r\nto return to the peace process on the bases agreed upon at\r\nthe Madrid Peace Conference: the “land-for-peace”\r\nformula and the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nAll the participants in the Madrid Peace Conference\r\nhad believed that the success achieved on the Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli track and the Jordanian-Israeli track had opened to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nthe peoples of the region, including the Israeli people, the\r\ndoor to a new life and a better future based on the\r\nprinciples of justice, peace for all, peaceful relations and\r\ntrade. They had also believed that this success proved once\r\nagain how misguided and wrong are obsolete principles\r\nsuch as that of achieving security through force and thus\r\nthrough the imposition of forced solutions. It also debunked\r\nthe principle of occupying other people’s land by force to\r\nensure one’s own security. Indeed, it has become clear that\r\nsecurity can be ensured only through dialogue, peaceful\r\ncoexistence, negotiations, mutual respect among peoples\r\nand free economic and trade relations, rather than through\r\npower politics and the imposition of forced solutions. Yet\r\nonce again we are hearing certain nervous calls to revive\r\nthe obsolete theory of security and the imposition of\r\nsolutions by force.\r\nAmid the gloom that has begun to enshroud the peace\r\nprocess, there is still a ray of hope. It is up to us, both\r\nArabs and Israelis, to keep it shining with a view to\r\nsecuring a better future for our children and our\r\ngrandchildren. For if, God forbid, we allowed this hope to\r\nbecome lost, a renewed cycle of violence, instability,\r\ntension, terrorism and extremism would prevail in the\r\nregion, as shown by the recent bloody violence.\r\nAt the Cairo summit, all Arab Governments expressed\r\nfor the first time their collective support and blessings for\r\nthe peace process and proclaimed that peace is an\r\nirreversible strategic option. We have heard similar pledges\r\nfrom the new Israeli Government. It is our sincere hope that\r\nthe United States and Russian co-sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess will intervene, and that international efforts will be\r\nmade to put the peace process back on track, restore its\r\nprevious vigour and impetus and put an end to all the\r\nobstacles that might impede or disrupt it.\r\nThe war and destruction in the region and the peace\r\nprocess that followed it have been described as a series of\r\nmissed opportunities; for in the past all of us have missed\r\ninvaluable opportunities for peace. Now here we are again,\r\nabout to return to that insane policy. By challenging the\r\nopponents of peace, President Arafat and the Palestinian\r\nleadership have demonstrated a serious and unambiguous\r\ndesire to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace.\r\nIt is not wise to reward him by embarrassing him before\r\nthe Palestinian people and placing him in an unenviable\r\nsituation vis-à-vis the opponents of peace, who are betting\r\non the failure of his policies and the failure of the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nNor is it prudent to stipulate that Syria and Lebanon\r\nmust return to the negotiating table without preconditions,\r\nas though the Madrid Conference and the painstaking and\r\ntough negotiations that followed had never taken place.\r\nDoes this condition itself not constitute a precondition for\r\nthe peace process? We all declared our intention to\r\nnurture the magnificent baby born at the Madrid\r\nConference, whom we named “the peace process”. But\r\nthen, we disagreed on the method to be followed in the\r\nbaby’s upbringing. Let us return to working together, so\r\nas not to kill the baby in its cradle and along with it our\r\npeoples’ chances for the better life which shone on the\r\nhorizon after decades of death and destruction.\r\nOne of the most important factors for the credibility\r\nof the Middle East peace process is the improvement in\r\nthe living conditions of the population through increased\r\ninvestment which has resulted in lowering the high\r\nunemployment rate. We in Jordan have taken numerous\r\nmeasures, enacted legislation and concluded agreements\r\nwith a view to protecting and promoting investment. I\r\nregret that despite these reassuring measures and\r\nguarantees and the convening of two international\r\neconomic summit conferences — in Casablanca in 1994\r\nand in Amman in 1995 — the real outcome in terms of\r\ninvestment in the region has been disappointing. Apart\r\nfrom the increase in tourism that we noticed following the\r\nsigning of the peace treaty, foreign industrial investment\r\nremains very low notwithstanding the many profitable\r\nprojects put forward at the recent Amman economic\r\nconference.\r\nWhile private foreign companies may have an\r\nexcuse for reluctance to invest, because of fears related to\r\nthe regime’s history and political situation, the\r\nGovernments of developed industrial countries have no\r\nexcuse for their failure to provide their insurance\r\ncompanies with sufficient guarantees against investment\r\nrisks to encourage companies to increase their\r\ninvestments. This is particularly true since the increased\r\nprofitability of these companies’ investment projects and\r\nthe resulting higher incomes in the recipient developing\r\ncountries would benefit the economies of the developed\r\nindustrial countries as well. In this regard, we have high\r\nhopes for the successful conclusion of the fourth\r\neconomic summit, to be held in Cairo next November.\r\nThis will provide another opportunity for foreign investors\r\nto contribute to the region’s development and to the\r\nconsolidation of peace — quite apart from the benefits\r\nthey and the economies of countries are bound to reap.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nOne of the region’s biggest and most complex\r\nproblems is that of Palestinian refugees; its settlement has\r\nbeen deferred to the final status negotiations. It is\r\nregrettable that the international community has not yet\r\ngiven this important political and humanitarian problem the\r\nattention, understanding and assistance it deserves. Every\r\nyear we receive the report of the Commissioner-General of\r\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\r\nRefugees in the Near East, in which he describes the\r\nAgency’s budget deficit and the consequent need to reduce\r\nthe level of services provided to the refugees.\r\nWe urge the wealthy industrial States to give this\r\nmatter their fullest attention and to increase their\r\ncontribution in order to ensure the survival of this\r\ntemporary solution to the major humanitarian problems that\r\naffect over 3.5 million Palestinian refugees, including some\r\n1.5 million who live in Jordan. The Government of Jordan,\r\ndespite its limited resources, is compelled to provide\r\nassistance and relief worth approximately $300 million\r\nannually. It is necessary to provide support for the\r\nAgency’s budget to enable it to continue its work\r\neffectively, pending a final solution of the refugee problem\r\non the basis of United Nations resolutions providing for\r\ntheir repatriation or compensation. As long as it remains\r\nwithout a substantive and effective solution, this problem\r\nwill continue to constitute a time bomb — forgive me for\r\nusing this term to indicate the magnitude of this problem —\r\nfor the peace process, in view of its significant\r\nhumanitarian and political dimensions.\r\nThe subject of peace in the Middle East leads us to\r\ndemand speedy implementation of the recent agreement\r\nbetween Iraq and the United Nations for a partial lifting of\r\nthe embargo on the sale of Iraqi oil in order to provide\r\nfood and medicine to the brotherly people of Iraq, who\r\nhave suffered, and continue to suffer, from the economic\r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. These sanctions have punished\r\nthem but have not affected their leaders. We call upon the\r\nGovernment of Iraq to implement United Nations\r\nresolutions; respect the sovereignty, independence and\r\nfreedom of neighbouring States; cooperate with the United\r\nNations Special Commission; cooperate in the release of\r\nKuwaiti prisoners of war held in Iraq; respect human rights;\r\nand establish a democratic system in which the rights of all\r\nits communities are respected. At the same time, we call for\r\nthe lifting of the economic sanctions that are punishing the\r\npeople of Iraq. We also call for respect for Iraq’s\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in\r\nits internal affairs. We reject any attempts aimed at dividing\r\nIraq, such as the recently proposed “safe areas” scheme.\r\nIt is also our hope that the United Arab Emirates\r\nwill be able to arrive at a peaceful solution enabling it to\r\nregain its three Gulf islands occupied by Iran. We call for\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain and\r\nextend our support to that sister country, at a time when\r\nit is the target of terrorism. We call upon Eritrea to find\r\na peaceful solution to the question of its withdrawal from\r\nthe Yemeni Huneish islands in response to Yemen’s\r\npeaceful efforts, in order to maintain good-neighbourly\r\nrelations and in gratitude for Yemen’s assistance to\r\nEritrea in attaining its independence and sovereignty.\r\nWe call for a just and speedy solution to the\r\nLockerbie problem, and for a positive response to the\r\ninitiatives and efforts of the League of Arab States, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, which would ensure the trial and punishment\r\nof the perpetrators of that heinous terrorist act without\r\npunishing all the people of Libya.\r\nMy country supports international efforts to combat\r\ninternational terrorism. Hence our active participation at\r\nthe Sharm el-Sheikh summit, held earlier this year at the\r\ninvitation of our sister country, the Arab Republic of\r\nEgypt, to explore the most effective means of\r\ninternational cooperation in this regard. We also support\r\nthe decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group\r\nof Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism\r\nand punishing its perpetrators, as terrorism has become a\r\ndangerous international phenomenon that has taken the\r\nlives of many innocent people, destroyed the\r\ninfrastructure of many countries, disrupted tourism and\r\nthe free movement of innocent people and defamed\r\nnational liberation and independence movements. We\r\ntherefore support bilateral, regional and international\r\ncooperation to combat this ugly and destructive\r\nphenomenon.\r\nToday the world stands on the threshold of a new\r\ncentury, only three years away. That historic occasion\r\nmust not pass without our pondering and studying the\r\nevents of the twentieth century in preparation for the\r\ncoming twenty-first century. We should benefit from the\r\nlessons we have learned and the events we have\r\nwitnessed in order to make the next century a safer, more\r\nsecure, stable and developed one for future generations.\r\nAn idea worthy of exploration and careful examination in\r\nthis regard is that of holding, at the outset of the new\r\ncentury, a special session of the General Assembly at the\r\nHeads of State level, to prepare for a new world order in\r\nwhose shaping all States, large and small, developed and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\ndeveloping, would participate. This is only an idea which\r\ncould be further elaborated and considered.\r\nAs the representative of a developing country, it\r\nconcerns me that despite the great progress achieved in the\r\nareas of disarmament and the resolution of global security\r\nproblems, there has been no resolution of the problem of\r\nthe economic security of the developing States. The gap\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries in the\r\nareas of income and technology is growing. Small\r\ndeveloping countries will not be able to find solutions in\r\nthe foreseeable future to their heavy burden of persistent\r\nindebtedness. It is both disastrous and painful that many\r\ndeveloping countries, such as my country, Jordan, give their\r\nfull efforts to consolidate and develop their democratic\r\nsystems, orient their economies towards privatization,\r\nreform their economic systems, redress their budgetary and\r\nbalance-of-payment deficits, fully cooperate with the World\r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund and make\r\nconcrete strides in this respect, and yet find themselves,\r\nafter their people have devoted all their resources,\r\ncapabilities and productivity to servicing and repaying their\r\nburdensome debts, still striving breathlessly to catch up\r\nwith the developed countries, without hope of soon ridding\r\nthemselves of this burden. Therefore, the shaping of and\r\npreparation for any new world order to be developed must\r\nconsider the important question of the economic security of\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nWe now live in a world where distances between its\r\nvarious places and economic markets have been reduced\r\ndue to tremendous technological strides in the areas of\r\ntransport and communications. This means that the\r\ndevelopment and well-being of the developing countries is\r\nan important part of the solution to the recession in the\r\ndeveloped countries. The idea of holding a special session\r\nof the General Assembly to prepare for a new world\r\neconomic order could be the subject of a draft resolution\r\nwhich I hope will be brought before this Assembly for\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Attorney General of the\r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas, Her Excellency The\r\nHonourable Janet G. Bostwick, M.P.\r\nMs. Bostwick (Bahamas): The Government of the\r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas warmly congratulates\r\nAmbassador Razali on his election to the presidency of this\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. His skills as a\r\ndistinguished diplomat are well known and, coupled with\r\nthe cooperation of Member States, will create the requisite\r\nconditions for a successful Assembly. I wish to assure\r\nhim of the full support of my delegation as he presides\r\nover the deliberations of this body.\r\nI wish also to express my delegation’s appreciation\r\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral of Portugal, who effectively guided the work of\r\na most historic and memorable fiftieth session. We wish\r\nalso to thank the Secretary-General for his leadership of\r\nthe Organization over the past year.\r\nThe Bahamas is indeed honoured to have been\r\nelected to serve as a Vice-President of the General\r\nAssembly at the fifty-first session. I wish to thank all\r\nMember States for their support in our realization of this\r\nachievement.\r\nOur deliberations during the last session provided an\r\nopportune environment for stocktaking and evaluation, as\r\nwell as the opportunity to look ahead and consider how\r\nwe ought to proceed for the next 50 years. The solemn\r\nDeclaration which we adopted at the end of the Special\r\nCommemorative Meeting, highlighted the international\r\ncommunity’s continued commitment to the United\r\nNations and to the purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nby which it is governed. The Bahamas is convinced that\r\nthe United Nations remains the primary world body with\r\nthe capacity and political will to bring together the\r\ndisparate elements of the international community, so as\r\nto face and deal with the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe Bahamas, like other countries, would wish to\r\nsee a strong and effective United Nations. It is our view\r\nthat the three-tiered reform process currently under way\r\nin the political, economic and social and administrative\r\nareas represents an important step in that direction. We\r\nmust remain diligent and focused in our work so as to\r\ntransform the United Nations into a structure equipped for\r\nthe fulfilment and support of the myriad demands of\r\nMember States.\r\nIn the area of political reform, the Bahamas\r\ncontinues to support the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil to enable it to become more effective,\r\nrepresentative, democratic and transparent. We are\r\ndisappointed that after another year of discussion little or\r\nno progress has been made. We urge all Member States\r\nto exercise flexibility so as to expedite agreement on this\r\nimportant matter.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nWe acknowledge the need to strengthen the United\r\nNations system in the economic and social fields. Action\r\nmust be taken to reduce duplication and to improve\r\ncoordination among the various agencies, including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions.\r\nThere is a clear need for reform and greater efficiency\r\nin the administrative and financial areas. The discussions in\r\nthe respective high-level Working Groups established to\r\nexamine these areas have been useful. However, few, if\r\nany, meaningful decisions have been taken to date. We urge\r\nMember States to increase the momentum, so as to put in\r\nplace the requisite measures to strengthen the efficacy of\r\nthe Organization. At the same time, the Bahamas urges and\r\nappeals to Member States to make a more determined effort\r\nto meet their financial obligations to the Organization. We\r\nare aware that the assessment system needs reform. Thus,\r\nwe should take the opportunity provided by this session to\r\nagree on an equitable scale of assessment for the next\r\ntriennium. The scale of assessment, when finalized, should\r\ntake into account all relevant circumstances, including the\r\nspecial circumstances of archipelagic island developing\r\ncountries and the need for the development of a\r\nvulnerability index. The Bahamas also wishes once again to\r\nurge the international community not to use high per capita\r\ngross national product (GNP) as the sole measurement of\r\ncapacity to pay when it considers the question of criteria\r\nfor the scale. The Bahamas, as well as a number of other\r\ncountries, has repeatedly argued that high per capita GNP\r\nis not an accurate measurement of a country’s wealth.\r\nIndeed, it presents a skewed and distorted picture of the\r\neconomic reality in my own country when one takes into\r\nconsideration the duplication of infrastructure and social\r\nservices.\r\nIn our efforts to reform this Organization, we must\r\nguard against engaging in reform for reform’s sake. The\r\nrestoration of the dignity of the individual must remain our\r\nprimary focus. The extent to which we neglect this highest\r\nof priorities is the extent to which human rights abuses and\r\ninequities will abound, giving rise to tensions and conflicts\r\non various levels, like those that have been witnessed by\r\nthe international community in recent years with the\r\nescalation of civil wars and ethnic strife in many parts of\r\nthe world. A total breakdown in society is the ultimate\r\nconsequence of such activities, which completely\r\noverwhelm national resources and consume inordinate\r\namounts of international energy which could be far more\r\nmeaningfully expended. To achieve meaningful reform we\r\nwill have to change our focus significantly. It will require\r\na shift in paradigms, where issues previously neglected will\r\nhave to be brought to the fore.\r\nWe need to be reminded that economic and social\r\nsecurity directly influence political security. They must\r\ntherefore be addressed in an integrated manner. We must\r\nguard against the additional threat of economic might\r\nbeing translated into military power, which not only\r\nsidelines and marginalizes the disadvantaged and\r\ndispossessed but also threatens our peace and security.\r\nOur efforts must be aimed at raising the standard of\r\nliving and quality of life of the world’s most\r\nunderprivileged. Despite impressive economic growth in\r\nmany countries, human development continues to move\r\nat a snail’s pace, particularly in developing countries. We\r\nmust find a way to balance economic growth and human\r\ndevelopment so as to ensure the sustainability and\r\nlivelihood of future generations.\r\nWe are merely proposing for the international\r\ncommunity what is already in place in the Bahamas. The\r\npromotion and protection of human rights, the\r\nadvancement of women, social justice, equality and\r\ndevelopment continue to receive priority attention from\r\nthe Government of the Bahamas. We are fully committed\r\nto securing a social environment in which our citizens can\r\nlive in harmony, prosperity and security, without fear or\r\nintimidation. Many of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe plans and programmes of action of the recent world\r\nconferences have already been implemented in the\r\nBahamas, and we will continue to put in place the\r\nnecessary infrastructure to facilitate the implementation of\r\nthose recommendations which have not yet been put into\r\npractice.\r\nOur past actions have brought us to a day of\r\nreckoning. The wealth of oceans once deemed\r\ninexhaustible has proven finite. Global warming is no\r\nlonger a prognostication, but a present condition. What is\r\nat stake here is the future of our planet and the lives of its\r\ninhabitants. The Bahamas urges that the special session\r\nfor the review of Agenda 21 in 1997 be viewed as an\r\nopportunity to re-examine our strategy and to correct past\r\nmistakes. The Bahamas hopes that the special session will\r\nfocus on practical proposals and not try to renegotiate\r\nAgenda 21. Definitive priorities and a recommitment to\r\nsustainable development should be set out, taking account\r\nof the recognized peculiar problems of small developing\r\nStates and the international community’s commitment to\r\nprovide resources to such States.\r\nThe Bahamas is concerned that protection be\r\nprovided to the fragile and vulnerable economies of small\r\nStates in a global community which is moving towards\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nthe strengthening and development of trading blocs. The\r\nnew international trade regime has put small States at a\r\ndisadvantage with the expectation that they liberalize their\r\nmarkets and open their borders in conformity with the\r\nobligations and commitments of the World Trade\r\nOrganization. The playing field must be levelled so that due\r\nregard can be given to the fragile domestic economies of\r\nthese States and their macroeconomic position. If the\r\ndeveloped countries are demanding protection for their\r\nsensitive domestic industries, then similar demands by\r\ndeveloping countries with respect to their domestic industry\r\nshould not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or\r\ninconsistent with current international trends.\r\nA review of current events reveals new threats to the\r\nfragile peace process in the Middle East. The Bahamas\r\nurges the parties concerned to make every possible effort to\r\nrestore order, to refrain from acts of violence and to\r\nreactivate the peace process, which enjoyed the widespread\r\nsupport of the international community. We commend\r\nPresident Clinton for his initiative in inviting Middle East\r\nleaders to Washington for discussion aimed at defusing this\r\nvolatile situation and thus, hopefully, restoring confidence\r\nin the peace process.\r\nOngoing conflicts in Africa are of grave concern. The\r\ninternational community should see it as its duty to support\r\nmeasures for the prevention and resolution of conflict in the\r\ncountries concerned and to address the economic and debt\r\nburdens that have crippled Africa. Although the African\r\ncountries themselves have made strenuous efforts towards\r\nreadjustment and recovery, they continue to require the\r\nassistance of the international community.\r\nThe Bahamas welcomes the approval by the Group of\r\nSeven of a debt-relief plan for the world’s poorest nations.\r\nThe debt-relief measure, which will release as many as 20\r\nof the poorest countries from up to $7.7 billion in debt, will\r\ngo a long way towards providing the needed relief for those\r\ncountries in their economic growth and development.\r\nThe Bahamas is pleased to note that after four years\r\nof devastating warfare free elections have taken place in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We note the appointment of a\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General on the\r\nquestion of Cyprus, and we urge the parties concerned to\r\ncontinue to seek a just and viable solution to that conflict.\r\nViolence perpetrated against the people of Cyprus cannot be\r\ncondoned.\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable and praiseworthy\r\nefforts of the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, Haiti still remains unstable to a degree\r\nthat threatens the stability of the entire region, with a\r\ncontinuing outflow of immigrants seeking a better way of\r\nlife in other countries. The majority of such immigrants\r\nretreat to the Bahamas.\r\nIt is regrettable that, notwithstanding the assistance\r\nof the international community, many areas of great\r\nconcern remain to be effectively tackled in Haiti.\r\nAttempts to restore democracy are constantly hindered by\r\nthe absence of the conditions necessary to support them.\r\nWe are therefore left with a population surrounded by\r\nmuch activity, but one whose daily existence remains\r\nmeagre at best. The consequences are predictable, namely,\r\nunrest and increased violence. It is therefore not sufficient\r\nto continue business as usual. The peculiar nature of the\r\nsituation in Haiti requires specific, focused and targeted\r\naction that addresses causes and not effects, one in which\r\ninitiatives provide direct benefits to the Haitian people.\r\nThe Bahamas views with much regret the continued\r\nescalation of the nefarious drug trade, particularly in the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region. We must double\r\nour efforts to fight this terrible scourge, and it is our hope\r\nthat the special session in 1998 will result in a renewed\r\ncommitment to fight and eradicate this illicit activity.\r\nWe are also of the view that efforts must be renewed\r\nto address the problem of the traffic in small arms, which\r\nhas increased to alarming proportions in recent times. We\r\nare particularly concerned about the large number of\r\nsmall arms that are smuggled into the Caribbean\r\ncountries. We urge the countries that manufacture and sell\r\narms to impose stricter arms control measures and\r\nprovide assistance to vulnerable States to reduce this\r\nthreat and increase the latters’ capability to combat such\r\nillegal activity.\r\nAt the same time, the international community must\r\nvoice unanimous disapproval and condemnation of the\r\nunrelenting increase in crime and the rise of terrorism that\r\nis currently confronting the international community. The\r\nBahamas regrets the failure to reach international\r\nconsensus on dealing swiftly with those grave areas of\r\nconcern. We urge that every effort be made to implement\r\nthe relevant agreements already in force and to put in\r\nplace any additional measures required to deal with these\r\nreprehensible activities.\r\nThe proliferation of arms, both conventional and\r\nthose designed for mass destruction, poses a serious threat\r\nto humanity. Thus, the Bahamas welcomed the recent\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nand intends to add its name shortly to the growing list of\r\nsignatories. Anti-personnel land-mines present an insidious\r\nchallenge to development and human dignity, and we\r\nshould move towards a complete ban on such treacherous\r\ntools of murder.\r\nThe Bahamas denounces the continued trans-shipment\r\nof nuclear material and hazardous waste through the\r\necosensitive Caribbean Sea. In this respect, the entire\r\nCaribbean Community is in agreement. Indeed in 1992, the\r\nHeads of Government of the Caribbean Community\r\ndeclared that the Caribbean Sea should be a nuclear-free-\r\nzone for purposes of shipment, storing or dumping of any\r\nradioactive or hazardous substances or toxic waste.\r\nThe Bahamas is encouraged by the steps taken by the\r\nsecond regular session of the International Seabed Authority\r\nat its meeting at Kingston last August, which are geared\r\ntowards ensuring the effective functioning of the Authority.\r\nAmong the issues before the General Assembly this\r\nsession is the matter of the international criminal court. We\r\nexhort the General Assembly to continue its work on this\r\nitem so as to enable the convening of a conference of\r\nplenipotentiaries in 1998 to adopt the statute of the court,\r\nthus fulfilling a lacuna in the existing international legal\r\norder.\r\nAs members are aware, the Bahamas is an archipelagic\r\nnation which, by any measure, is a small State with a\r\npopulation of less than 300,000. However, we are a proud\r\npeople and strong in our belief in justice for all and in the\r\ninalienable rights of all people, as enshrined in the Charter\r\nof this noble Organization.\r\nIt is in this spirit of justice and fair play that over the\r\npast two years we have repeatedly recorded our support in\r\nthe General Assembly for the efforts of the 21 million\r\ninhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwan as they\r\nentreat the Organization to examine the merits of\r\nestablishing a committee to analyse in depth the\r\nimplications, both now and for the future, of continuing to\r\npreclude those 21 million souls from formal representation\r\nin the General Assembly by way of membership in the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Bahamas again calls on the nations of the world,\r\nas Members of this august and united international body of\r\nnations, to hear the plea of those 21 million souls on the\r\nisland of Taiwan and to consider what is just and right for\r\nthem as they too seek to avail themselves of the benefits\r\nof membership in the United Nations.\r\nThe next 50 years will be painful and exacting as we\r\nattempt to ensure that the pitfalls of the past are avoided.\r\nMany changes will be required. In effecting change, we\r\nmust ensure that it is profitable, for while change is\r\ninevitable, progress is not. The tendency to hold onto the\r\nold way of doing business in the midst of necessary\r\nchange will remain our greatest challenge. As we seek to\r\nbalance our efforts, it must be remembered that\r\ntransformation in one area does not necessarily relegate\r\nall others to irrelevance.\r\nMany reasons have been proffered for the present\r\nstate of affairs. Not surprisingly, none of them seem to\r\ninvolve the proponents. While everyone talks about the\r\nfuture, few are willing to make the necessary sacrifices to\r\nsecure it. Rhetoric boils with urgency, but talks move\r\nslowly, and action is even more halting.\r\nThe uncharted waters ahead remain daunting, defined\r\nby bilious seas of unrelenting, sophisticated, transnational\r\ncriminal activity, which is tearing at the very fabric of\r\nsociety. Environmental degradation has exposed the Earth\r\nto permanent damage. Navigation of these seas requires\r\nus to rise above platitudes and empty promises. We must\r\nrepudiate the adversaries of peace.\r\nOur evaluations during the past session confirmed\r\nthe continuing validity of the United Nations as the\r\nprincipal mechanism for addressing world concerns.\r\nDespite its uneven accomplishments, the United Nations\r\nfacilitates collaboration for the resolution of societal ills,\r\nwhatever their origin. The structure and machinery of the\r\nUnited Nations must be such that we are encouraged to\r\ncontinue to use the relatively calm chambers of this forum\r\nfor our deliberations. This is the only safeguard we have\r\nagainst countries’ being tempted to take their disputes out\r\nto sea.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for External Relations of Sudan, Mr. Ali Osman\r\nMohamed Taha, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Taha (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express to Mr. Razali Ismail\r\nour sincere congratulations on his election as President of\r\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. His rich\r\nexperience, wisdom and knowledge will definitely lead to\r\nthe success of our deliberations, which are taking place in\r\nvery delicate international circumstances. I assure him of\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nthe full support and assistance of my delegation in\r\ndischarging his task successfully.\r\nAllow me also to take this opportunity to express my\r\nsincere appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Freitas\r\ndo Amaral, for his successful efforts in leading the work of\r\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe international community had keenly hoped that\r\nthe post-cold-war era would result in an end to the tensions\r\nthat had characterized the international scene and to the\r\narms race and armed conflicts. All nations, particularly\r\nthose in the developing world, have aspirations to build a\r\nnew world order whose cornerstone would be equality\r\namong States, non-interference in their internal affairs,\r\ntransparency and respect for ideological, cultural and\r\nreligious diversity.\r\nAny observer of today’s international scene would\r\nconclude that events are completely contrary to\r\nexpectations. Tensions have escalated, and political, military\r\nand economic threats are on the increase. Apparently,\r\nequality among States of sovereignty, rights and obligations\r\nno longer exists. Moreover, the nuclear threat still lingers\r\non, military conflicts have not ceased and ideological\r\nfanaticism and cultural hegemony have become the major\r\nfeatures of the new world order.\r\nThe Sudan is of the view that the structure of the\r\ninternational community, which is based on ideological,\r\npolitical and cultural diversity and pluralism, prompts us all\r\nto accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony\r\nand diversity among nations become the vehicle for\r\ninteraction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing\r\nnational interests in the context of the international system.\r\nThe nations of the world expect the United Nations to\r\nbe a forum in which they can express their views and\r\npositions and an instrument for the continued pursuit of\r\nhumanity’s aspirations to freedom, prosperity, peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt is against that background that the call has sounded\r\nfor the reform of the United Nations system. True and\r\nsincere adherence to the spirit and letter of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, equality, respect for the sovereignty of\r\nMember States, non-interference in their internal affairs and\r\nrespect for their right to choose are the bases for\r\nstrengthening the United Nations and fostering its role,\r\ntransparency and democratization, so that it may meet the\r\nenormous challenges of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and serving economic and social development.\r\nI should like to point out that my country has\r\nfollowed with satisfaction the positive reforms that have\r\nbeen undertaken by the Secretary-General. The Sudan\r\nsupports the position expressed by both the League of\r\nArab States and the Organization of African Unity\r\nendorsing the re-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\r\nfor a second term.\r\nThe Sudan also welcomes General Assembly\r\nresolution 50/227 on the restructuring and revitalization of\r\nthe United Nations in the economic, social and related\r\nfields. On the other hand, it is imperative that a thorough\r\nreview of the Security Council take place to ensure its\r\ndemocratization and to allow for equitable representation\r\nby the developing countries, including permanent\r\nmembership. There is a strong need to review the work\r\nand procedures of the Security Council in order to\r\nachieve transparency and to enable all States to follow the\r\nformal and informal meetings of the Council. It is equally\r\nvital that the decision-making mechanism be corrected by\r\nestablishing just criteria to guide its policies and distance\r\nit from selectivity and double standards. In this context,\r\nthe veto concept must be reviewed and corrected so that\r\nthe principle of equality among Member States stipulated\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations may become a\r\nreality.\r\nFinally, the Security Council should discharge its\r\npolitical responsibilities without addressing legal issues,\r\nwhich fall within the jurisdiction of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, as stipulated in the Charter and the\r\nStatute of the Court. The Court must be enhanced to\r\nenable it to shoulder its responsibilities in handling legal\r\ndisputes among Member States.\r\nIn this connection, it is important to note the new\r\ntrend towards the imposition of sanctions against some\r\ncountries as a means of settling certain disputes, as has\r\nbeen witnessed recently. Such sanctions have adversely\r\naffected the people of those countries, particularly the\r\nvulnerable sectors of society, namely, women, children\r\nand the elderly, the very sectors that the United Nations\r\nhas pledged to protect and develop. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to reconsider the basis on which sanctions are\r\nimposed, the duration of such sanctions and the lifting of\r\nthem when the requirements have been met or when their\r\nimplications give rise to human suffering.\r\nThe ideal means for settling most recent conflicts is\r\nthrough strict compliance with the provisions for conflict\r\nresolution as stipulated in the Charter, the consolidation\r\nof cooperation among States, the encouragement of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\ndialogue and the fostering of international public opinion\r\nthrough common understanding. Therefore, my country\r\nwelcomes the endeavours designed to enhance preventive\r\ndiplomacy and its mechanisms in order to achieve these\r\ngoals.\r\nI wish now to touch upon some important international\r\nissues. We look forward to the success of the ongoing\r\nefforts of the countries of West Africa, under the leadership\r\nof our sister country, Nigeria, to ensure that the people of\r\nLiberia are able to achieve stability. We also hope that the\r\nefforts to end the conflict in Angola will stop the bloodshed\r\nand steer the country towards development. We also call on\r\nthe people of our sister country, Somalia, and the factions\r\nthere, to rise above their differences in order to preserve\r\nindependence and unity and resume their march towards\r\nprosperity and progress.\r\nWe also hope that Rwanda and Burundi will achieve\r\nstability, and that they will use diversity as an element of\r\nunity and strength. We call for the enhancement and\r\nsupport of the role of the Organization of African Unity in\r\nits efforts towards settlement of these conflicts. Africa, as\r\nthe continent of the future, needs the support of the\r\ninternational community so that it can achieve political\r\nstability and economic development, and contribute to\r\nestablishing a more just and stable international community.\r\nAs for the sanctions imposed on the Libyan people,\r\nwe fully support the Libyan initiatives, which are also\r\nsupported by the League of Arab States and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, to put an end to the conflict\r\nbetween Libya and three Western countries. My country\r\nappeals to the international community to exert greater\r\nefforts to reach a final settlement to this dispute and to\r\nalleviate the suffering of the Libyan people by ending the\r\nembargo to which they are subjected.\r\nAs for the Middle East, Sudan believes that peace\r\nshould be built on the principles of justice and respect for\r\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab\r\npeoples in the region, and that peace must also be based on\r\nthe commitments agreed to by the parties concerned. Any\r\nretreat from agreed obligations and commitments\r\ncontradicts a real desire to achieve peace.\r\nThe irresponsible practices of the occupying Power\r\nwill have serious repercussions for the peoples and\r\ncountries of the region, and will have a negative effect on\r\ninternational peace and security. Therefore, Sudan calls for\r\nthe immediate implementation of all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions in order to achieve a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace on all tracks of the process. We\r\ndraw the attention of the international community to the\r\nprecarious situation in the region, the consequences of\r\ncontinued failure and the increasing possibilities of\r\nconfrontation, which make it necessary for the\r\ninternational community to be vigilant, dynamic and strict\r\nin implementing justice and the rule of law so as to save\r\nthe region from the potential scourge of war.\r\nWith regard to the Gulf region, we look forward to\r\nthe restoration of the peace and security that it enjoyed\r\nbefore to the war. The Sudan would like to reiterate the\r\nimportance of compliance with Security Council\r\nresolutions regarding the sovereignty and legitimate rights\r\nto existence of Kuwait, and the rights of its people and\r\nleadership with regard to security and stability. Similarly,\r\nwe reiterate the right of Iraq to sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and independence. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity to lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq, which\r\nare causing suffering and starvation for the Iraqi people,\r\nand, in this respect, we call for the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995).\r\nWith regard to Europe, my country expresses its\r\nsatisfaction with the signing of the Dayton Agreement,\r\naimed at ending the suffering of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. For several years their suffering caused\r\nanguish in the conscience of the international community.\r\nWe also express our heartfelt congratulations to President\r\nAlija Izetbegović for gaining the people’s confidence in\r\nhis leadership. We call upon the United Nations to work\r\nfor the full implementation of the Dayton Agreement, in\r\nparticular the prosecution of Serb leaders responsible for\r\nthe crimes of genocide, “ethnic cleansing” and other\r\nviolations of international law. We also call on the\r\ninternational community to provide the necessary\r\nassistance and resources for the reconstruction of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nWith regard to Asia, we express our satisfaction with\r\nthe agreement reached between the Government of the\r\nPhilippines and the Moro National Liberation Front,\r\nwhich reflects the wisdom of both parties. In this context,\r\nwe commend the efforts of President Soeharto of\r\nIndonesia and his Foreign Minister, which culminated in\r\nthe agreement.\r\nSocial and economic development is the primary\r\nrequisite for political stability to deter the scourge of wars\r\nand conflicts. In this respect we express the deep concern\r\nof Africa, which calls for justice, an end to its\r\nmarginalization, and compensation for all the injustices\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\ninflicted on it during the colonial era and for the inequities\r\nof the international economic order.\r\nThe majority of the least developed countries are in\r\nAfrica, and they need support and assistance. The debts of\r\nAfrican countries, which exceed $300 billion, have become\r\nthe main impediment to the ambitions of the continent to\r\nachieve development and to ensure the prosperity of its\r\npeoples. In most African countries debt-servicing costs\r\nexceed the gross national product and total export earnings.\r\nThe African countries have welcomed the World Bank\r\ninitiative to reduce the debt burden of the least developed\r\ncountries. Sudan believes that the effective solution of the\r\ndebt crisis requires agreement on a unified strategy, with\r\nthe aim of cancelling or reducing debts for all those\r\ncountries, without exception. We also call on the\r\ninternational community to provide the necessary financial\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General’s Initiative for\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nThe mid-term reviews of the Paris Programme of\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s and\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s have shown that pledges should be\r\nfollowed by action, not by more promises.\r\nIn the field of food security and the prevention of\r\nfamine, which are issues of primary concern to Africa and\r\nthe rest of the world, my country places high hopes on the\r\nforthcoming World Food Summit, which will take place at\r\nRome in November 1996, which will seek solutions for the\r\nproblem of food security throughout the world. Sudan,\r\nwhich is perceived to be one of the countries with the\r\npotential to play a considerable role in the production of\r\nfood, is ready to shoulder its responsibility, together with a\r\nserious contribution from the international community\r\ntowards that end.\r\nHuman rights issues have priority on the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations. They receive the full support of my\r\ncountry, based on our conviction that human beings are the\r\nonly creatures that have been honoured and given\r\nresponsibility by Almighty God, and on our commitment to\r\nhuman rights covenants.\r\nHowever, we disagree with the growing tendency to\r\nexploit human rights issues to serve the political interests of\r\ncertain circles, in a manner that jeopardizes the principles\r\nof human rights. Selectivity does not serve the cause of\r\nhuman rights as well as objectivity and comprehensiveness;\r\nconfrontation and condemnation do not support human\r\nrights as well as cooperation, conviction and\r\nencouragement.\r\nIn line with this understanding, my country has\r\nestablished the Advisory Council for Human Rights, to\r\nprotect human rights and investigate all accusations and\r\ncomplaints in this regard. The Sudan also resumed its\r\ncooperation with the Special Rapporteur on human rights\r\nafter the causes of our withdrawal of cooperation had\r\nbeen removed. We reiterate here our commitment to\r\ncooperation on this matter, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of objectivity, transparency and respect for\r\ncultural diversity and pluralism. This last principle\r\nprompts me to refer to the attack on Islam, which\r\nportrays it as barbaric and links it to terrorism. These\r\nmalicious allegations are unjust; Islam is completely\r\ninnocent. They contravene the principle of respect for all\r\nreligions without exception. Wrong practices do not\r\nconstitute evidence to justify negative judgements on the\r\nreligious beliefs of those who perpetrate them. Such\r\ntrends make all religions and philosophies susceptible to\r\ncondemnation, regardless of their sources or origins.\r\nIslam is the religion of tolerance and coexistence.\r\nWe therefore call upon the international community to\r\nstop this ferocious campaign targeting Islam, and call\r\nupon the United Nations to distance itself from it. We\r\nhope that the positive positions of a number of Western\r\nleaders towards Islam will be echoed by the communities\r\nin the West, their mass media and their justice systems.\r\nI deem it necessary, in addressing the Assembly, to\r\nshed light on some important political developments in\r\nmy country. I hope members will listen attentively to\r\nwhat I am about to say and will open their hearts while\r\nI touch on the circumstances that surrounded the adoption\r\nof Security Council resolutions 1044 (1996), 1054 (1996)\r\nand 1070 (1996), respectively, against my country.\r\nFirst, it has been proven that 11 Egyptians were the\r\norganizers and perpetrators of the attempt that was the\r\nsubject of these resolutions.\r\nSecond, prior to the incident the suspects had been\r\nmoving in a number of Arab, African and Asian\r\ncountries. The Sudan was but one of these countries.\r\nThird, the Security Council has based its resolutions\r\non the statement of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution, which called upon the Sudan to look for,\r\nlocate and extradite the suspects if — and I underline\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nif — they were found in the Sudan. This was stipulated in\r\nthe Mechanism’s decision of 19 December 1995.\r\nFourth, those resolutions were based on the\r\nassumption that the three suspects, who are Egyptians, were\r\nin the Sudan at the time the other members of the group\r\nentered Addis Ababa from other countries, several months\r\nbefore the incident.\r\nFifth — and this I would underline — no evidence\r\nwas produced to prove that the suspects were in the Sudan\r\nat the time the incident took place or at the time the Sudan\r\nwas asked to hand over the suspects, which request was\r\nreceived more than a month after the incident.\r\nSixth, a secret trial was conducted for the three\r\nsuspects, who were sentenced to death. Concerned States\r\nand observers were never allowed to witness the trial.\r\nSeventh, the Sudan has unequivocally condemned this\r\nincident since day one, and it has expressed its readiness to\r\ncooperate with the concerned parties.\r\nEighth, the Sudan received the first request to arrest\r\nthe suspects 32 days after the incident. The request did not\r\nprovide sufficient information about the suspects.\r\nNinth, the competent Sudanese authorities conducted\r\nexhaustive and complete investigations, but these did not\r\nyield any information or prove the presence of the suspects\r\non Sudanese territory.\r\nTenth, though the Sudan has time and again requested\r\nthe cooperation of concerned countries and of the\r\nInternational Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) in\r\nthis regard, its efforts have been in vain.\r\nEleventh, it has been proven that the first suspect is in\r\nAfghanistan. An official document confirming that fact was\r\nsubmitted to the Security Council by the Afghan\r\nGovernment. Moreover, in statements to the press, the first\r\nsuspect claimed full responsibility for the incident and\r\nconfirmed that he has not entered the Sudan since 1994.\r\nTwelfth, the Sudan reiterates its full readiness to\r\ncooperate with all parties concerned, and it emphasizes that\r\nall available evidence indicates that the suspects are not\r\npresent on Sudanese territory.\r\nTo insist on imposing sanctions on the Sudan defies\r\nlogic and justice. This must be reconsidered in order to\r\nredress the injustice inflicted on my country and to alleviate\r\nthe negative impact of this recurrent series of sanctions,\r\nwhich could cause massive human suffering to innocent\r\npeople.\r\nAs we stated before the Assembly last year, we\r\nreiterate our condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations. We reaffirm our readiness to\r\ncooperate and to participate effectively in efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism. We are actively involved in this matter\r\nat regional levels, in particular within the framework of\r\nthe League of Arab States. We reiterate our commitment\r\nto contribute to the establishment of more secure, stable\r\nand just international relations.\r\nThe Sudan has witnessed a number of internal\r\npolitical developments this year. Parliamentary elections\r\nwere held, followed by a presidential election by direct\r\nballoting. All Sudanese citizens exercised their democratic\r\nright in a free and fair election monitored by\r\nrepresentatives of friendly countries and international and\r\nregional bodies.\r\nThe genuine efforts my Government has exerted\r\ntirelessly in recent years have culminated in the signing\r\nof a political charter between the Government and two\r\nimportant rebel factions. In response to the signing of the\r\npolitical charter, other rebel factions joined the peace\r\nprocess, most recently the SPLA, the Popular Movement\r\nfor Peace and the Popular Movement for the Liberation\r\nof the Sudan.\r\nWhile our charter affirms that shariah and are the\r\nmain sources of legislation in the country, it allows States\r\nto promulgate complementary legislation compatible with\r\ntheir needs. We in the Sudan recognize cultural diversity.\r\nIn accordance with our charter, freedom of religious\r\nbelief and the prohibition of forceful conversion to any\r\nreligion or faith are fully granted. We also recognize\r\npluralism. Accordingly, we guarantee the right to religion\r\nand belief. No one can be forced to accept any religious\r\nbelief.\r\nThe Charter ensures the fair distribution of resources\r\nand power-sharing among citizens. It also calls for the\r\nestablishment of a coordination council for the southern\r\nstates in order to contribute to the implementation of the\r\nprovisions stipulating the holding of a comprehensive\r\nreferendum among the citizens of southern Sudan after an\r\ninterim period, the length of which has yet to be\r\nnegotiated.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nRelentless efforts are being made in order to reach a\r\nsettlement with the faction that has thus far remained\r\noutside of the peace process. Consultations and coordination\r\nare currently under way with the concerned parties, in\r\nparticular with the countries of the region represented in the\r\nInter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development\r\n(IGADD).\r\nThe Sudan welcomes and appreciates the contribution\r\nby friendly countries towards our sincere and genuine\r\nsearch for lasting peace in our country. I am pleased to\r\ninform members of the Khartoum agreement, signed\r\nbetween the Sudan and Uganda through the kind and much\r\nappreciated mediation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This\r\nagreement was further strengthened by the conclusion in\r\nTehran last week of an agreement on a verification\r\nmechanism for the implementation of the agreement, with\r\nthe participation of Iran and Malawi.\r\nAt this juncture, as I speak of Sudan’s greatest and\r\nmost urgent priority — peace — I wish to pay tribute to\r\nthe intensive intellectual efforts being exerted by the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), within its specific mandate in the United\r\nNations system and by all ways and means available to it,\r\nto establish a culture of peace. This is based on the\r\nconstruction in the minds of men in defence of peace, as\r\nstipulated in the preamble of UNESCO’s statute.\r\nMy Government has fully cooperated with UNESCO\r\nin the promotion of the noble objectives of this programme.\r\nWe did so notably through our contribution to the 1995\r\nBarcelona conference and to the follow-up seminar in the\r\nNetherlands in May 1996. We sincerely hope that such\r\ndialogue will continue, with a view to creating an\r\nenvironment conducive to achieving a comprehensive\r\npeace.\r\nFor more than three decades, my country has hosted\r\nover a million refugees from neighbouring countries as a\r\nresult of the unstable security situation in those countries.\r\nWe have provided them security and stability as well as\r\neducational, health and other essential services. In the\r\nframework of solving the refugee problem through\r\nvoluntary repatriation, the Sudan has cooperated with the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and other concerned countries, and has\r\nsigned tripartite agreements for the repatriation of the\r\nrefugees from some of those countries. We hope to reach\r\nsimilar agreements concerning the rest of the refugees, thus\r\nguaranteeing their repatriation in dignity.\r\nWe call upon the international community to share\r\nthis burden with the Government of the Sudan. As the\r\nSudan is experiencing severe economic difficulties, the\r\nresources allocated to refugee programmes have\r\ndiminished considerably. This has resulted in severe\r\npressures on Sudan’s public sector, since the refugees\r\nshare food and services with Sudanese citizens.\r\nAware of its responsibilities towards its people, the\r\nSudan has sought to deliver food and other relief\r\nassistance to its war-affected populations throughout the\r\ncountry, including in areas controlled by the rebels.\r\nBased on this understanding, the Sudan initiated the\r\nidea of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) and has\r\nconsistently urged its implementation in cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations. A number of General Assembly\r\nresolutions have commended the full cooperation between\r\nthe Sudan and the United Nations in this Operation. The\r\npractical implementation of OLS has yielded a number of\r\nimportant observations, which we will submit to the\r\nreview meeting scheduled this month in the hope of an\r\nadequate response. We urge and hope that the next phase\r\nof OLS will see a fairer distribution of relief supplies and\r\nthat it will contribute further towards the development and\r\nrehabilitation process, thus promoting an environment\r\nconducive to peace and stability.\r\nIn spite of these observations, I should like to\r\nexpress the full commitment of the Government of the\r\nSudan to cooperation with the United Nations in the\r\nimplementation of the objectives of Operation Lifeline\r\nSudan in accordance with the principles of neutrality,\r\ntransparency and respect for the sovereignty of my\r\ncountry.\r\nAs mankind approaches the dawn of the new\r\ncentury, we hope that the United Nations will be its\r\nvehicle and bridge to a world in which hope, peace and\r\njustice will prevail. Let us unite our wills and harmonize\r\nour ideals towards the achievement of this noble\r\nobjective.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, His Excellency\r\nMr. Povilas Gylys.\r\nMr. Gylys (Lithuania): On behalf of the Lithuanian\r\nGovernment, allow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at this session.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nThis session marks the fifth anniversary of the re-\r\nentrance of Lithuania into the international community of\r\nstates. Five years ago, Lithuania was admitted to the United\r\nNations. At that time, the Organization, its Member States\r\nand the peoples of the world saw the chance to seize\r\nhistoric opportunities created by the new international\r\nsituation, with its promise of peace and stability.\r\nThe past five years leave no doubt that some of these\r\nopportunities have been taken in a positive way. We have\r\nseen that the highest levels of cooperation are possible, both\r\ninternationally and regionally. The destinies of different\r\npeoples around the world have been linked as never before\r\nby the globalization of the world economy and the\r\ninformation superhighway.\r\nBut many cross-border issues, such as crime, drugs,\r\nenvironmental pollution and terrorism, pose a major\r\nchallenge to us not only as individual nation-States, but as\r\na family of nations as well. These global challenges have\r\nfar-reaching implications for the world Organization.\r\nOriginally, the United Nations was entrusted with the\r\ntask of ensuring world harmony. Is it no less vital today to\r\nmaintain and promote this worldwide policy, as designed by\r\nthe founders of the United Nations? My answer is in the\r\npositive.\r\nFor this reason, we need an Organization that can be\r\nmore responsive to the demands of Member States, and\r\nMember States that act responsibly by setting realistic goals\r\nand providing the resources needed for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nDuring these past five years, Lithuania has progressed\r\npolitically and economically. Our relations with\r\nneighbouring States are friendly and mutually beneficial,\r\nthus ensuring a secure and stable environment in the region.\r\nWe are in the process of becoming integrated into European\r\nand transatlantic structures. Negotiations on accession to the\r\nWorld Trade Organization are well-advanced, ties with our\r\nneighbours that are members of the Central European Free\r\nTrade Agreement are gaining strength. The most valuable\r\ncooperation is being advanced with Nordic countries, the\r\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Alliance. These\r\ndimensions of cooperation have been fruitfully applied in\r\nother structures as well. Cooperation with the European\r\nUnion on core United Nations issues — humanitarian\r\naffairs, human rights, peacekeeping, structural and financial\r\nreforms — and with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\nin the Implementation Force mission is the best example.\r\nWe are striving to deepen and broaden this cooperation.\r\nThe global challenges before us require the\r\ncommitment of Member States to the goals enshrined in\r\nthe United Nations Charter and call for structural and\r\ninstitutional reform of the Organization. We have begun\r\nthe reform aimed at streamlining the functions of the\r\nUnited Nations and rendering its institutional structure\r\nmore effective and flexible to deal with tasks which\r\nsometimes cannot be foreseen in advance. We must bear\r\nin mind that the future Organization can be only as\r\neffective as its Member States desire it to be.\r\nFirst, it goes without saying that we must put the\r\nUnited Nations on a sound financial footing and\r\nstrengthen its capacity to fulfil its vital tasks. We support\r\nthe proposals put forward by the European Union in this\r\nregard. A realigned scale of assessments, annual revision\r\nof the scale, phasing out the scheme of limits, lowering\r\nthe assessment floor and swift implementation of the\r\nproposals in practice would be the tools to overcome the\r\nfinancial crisis and would certainly be an incentive for\r\nMembers to regularize payments.\r\nLithuania remains committed to its financial\r\nobligations to the Organization. We also reiterate our\r\nfundamental belief that the scale of assessments must\r\nreflect the capacity to pay. At a time when many\r\ncountries, Lithuania included, are undergoing budgetary\r\nadjustments and reviews, sound management of the\r\nresources of the United Nations takes on added\r\nimportance.\r\nSecondly, we believe that the functioning of United\r\nNations decision-making bodies must be improved. The\r\nSecurity Council makes decisions that are binding on all\r\nMember States and influences the lives of millions. It is\r\nthus essential to make the Council more representative of\r\nthe world as it is today. More specifically, Lithuania has\r\ncalled for increasing the representational capacity of the\r\nSecurity Council in both categories of membership. The\r\nGovernment of Lithuania recognizes that developing\r\ncountries have a case for improving their representation.\r\nWe also recognize that some countries, such as Germany\r\nand Japan, can make a special contribution and that they\r\nare ready to assume special political, military and\r\nfinancial responsibility as new permanent members. In\r\nour view, due consideration should also be given to the\r\naspirations to an additional non-permanent seat of the\r\ncountries of Eastern Europe, whose numbers have tripled\r\nin recent years. We hope for agreement on the reform of\r\nthe Security Council. Lithuania supports proposals to this\r\nend and encourages stronger movement by States towards\r\nnegotiations on the implementation of reform.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nIn terms of a comprehensive reform of the United\r\nNations system, any such reform is likely to fail if there is\r\nno clear vision of its objectives and of the strategies for\r\npursuing them. A stark reassessment of the mission and\r\nmandates is included in the United Nations medium-term\r\nplan for 1998-2001. We consider it to be a good basis for\r\ndebate on the enhancement of the United Nations and for\r\nstrengthening its capacity to face new emerging challenges.\r\nLithuania, striving to make its contribution to\r\ninternational cooperation in the maintenance of security and\r\nstability, is determined to continue to improve the skills of\r\nits peacekeepers, civilian police monitors and military\r\nobservers and will offer them to the United Nations in the\r\nservice of peacekeeping operations. Lithuania, in\r\ncooperation with Estonia and Latvia, and also with Poland,\r\nis advancing the development of joint peacekeeping units,\r\nan exercise which in itself is a testimony to ultimate\r\nunderstanding and cooperation between countries.\r\nThe costs and scope of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations have proliferated dramatically since 1990. One\r\nof the best ways to reduce this proliferation, and more\r\nparticularly to prevent human suffering, is to implement\r\nmany of the proposals put forward by the Secretary-General\r\nin his “An Agenda for Peace”, especially in terms of\r\nresolving disputes before violence breaks out.\r\nUnited Nations intervention too often comes too\r\nslowly and too late under very difficult circumstances.\r\nLacking resources, the Secretary-General is sometimes\r\nexpected to maintain peace where there is no will to\r\nmaintain peace. We feel that the emphasis needs to be\r\nplaced on strengthening the United Nations system’s\r\npreventive capacity. We may need to adopt the\r\nmultidimensional approach to the concept of security,\r\nmobilize the United Nations system in order to prevent\r\nexisting disputes from escalating into conflict, and attack\r\nthe problem at its very roots.\r\nLithuania welcomes measures to strengthen the United\r\nNations administrative structures in charge of peacekeeping\r\noperations. The experience of the past few years leads us to\r\nbelieve that we need to explore non-traditional approaches\r\nto conflict prevention and resolution, including the\r\nOrganization’s rapid response capability. While the demand\r\nin this domain still seems to be more than the United\r\nNations is equipped for, the burden-sharing of peacekeeping\r\nwith other regional organizations has to prevent the eruption\r\nof a severe crisis. The complexity of the maintenance of\r\npeace and security should not be solely a United Nations\r\nenterprise. In Europe, we have the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, which operates in\r\naccordance with agreed principles and is engaged in\r\nactivities to help parties to resolve disputes without\r\nrecourse to fighting.\r\nLithuania believes that any strategy for preventing\r\narmed conflicts also involves pursuing tangible\r\ndisarmament objectives, especially in the areas of nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation and the control of conventional arms.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty now\r\nready for signature can be considered one of the historic\r\ndecisions of this decade. Today, I signed the Treaty on\r\nbehalf of the Republic of Lithuania. I believe this tangible\r\nachievement of humankind should fuel international\r\nefforts to take further effective measures towards nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nA major challenge immediately ahead is the\r\nmaintenance of multilateral disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation efforts. We must find a key to freeze the\r\nproduction and development of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. The adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty should set the tone for the disarmament\r\nprocess which will be accompanied by the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production,\r\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their\r\nDestruction. We must cope with new nuclear challenges,\r\nsuch as nuclear leakage, smuggling of fissile materials,\r\nfailures in nuclear-custody systems and the potential\r\nthreat of nuclear terrorism.\r\nMoreover, the dangerously widespread use of\r\nconventional weapons undermines all attempts at the\r\npeaceful solution to conflicts. Sometimes, as in the case\r\nof land-mines, the deadly consequences persist for many\r\nyears, causing human suffering and resulting in enormous\r\ncosts. The growing support for banning the production of\r\nand trade in anti-personnel land-mines is one way to\r\ncorrect this problem.\r\nPeace and development are closely linked and\r\ndevelopment is a multifaceted process. Revitalization of\r\nthe United Nations in economic, social and related fields,\r\nand interaction between the United Nations and other\r\nmultilateral development institutions, including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, should be addressed to better structure the\r\nOrganization for serving peoples’ development needs.\r\nSustainable development must be based on participatory\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nDemocratization must take hold inside a State and\r\nshould extend to the international community. The process\r\nof democratization cannot be separated from the protection\r\nof human rights. We will continue to support United\r\nNations programmes aimed at promoting a democratic\r\nculture and at consolidating new or re-established\r\ndemocracies.\r\nHumanitarian assistance efforts face the challenge of\r\nresponding to humanitarian crises that have increased both\r\nin number and complexity. United Nations programmes\r\ncould complement other initiatives already in place and\r\nshould be expanded in those fields where collective action\r\nis required, such as in comprehensive reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation of war-ravaged areas.\r\nAlthough the merits of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees in facilitating\r\nsolutions to acute migration problems are evident, some\r\ntendencies are cause for concern. The international\r\ncommunity needs updated approaches in resolution and\r\nprevention policy. The Conference on Refugees and\r\nMigrants in the Commonwealth of Independent States and\r\nneighbouring countries, held in Geneva in May 1996, was\r\na step towards action on a regional level. We hope that\r\ncountries will adhere to the Programme of Action, in\r\nparticular those provisions concerning illegal migration.\r\nWe are in favour of strengthening mechanisms to\r\nmonitor and protect human rights, especially in conflict\r\nsituations. When these rights are seriously violated despite\r\nall efforts to the contrary, we are in favour of turning to\r\njudicial recourse. For this reason, we support the creation\r\nof an international criminal court for the adjudication of all\r\nhuman rights violations, wherever they may occur.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges stymieing the efforts of\r\nthe international community to ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment and democracy is transnational crime. This\r\noften takes the form of illicit sales of arms and drugs, illicit\r\ntrafficking in people, child prostitution and other crimes. No\r\nsingle country is able to cope with well-organized and well-\r\nfinanced criminal structures. We deem that efficient anti-\r\nmoney-laundering measures can be among the best tools to\r\nundermine the economic roots of the criminal world.\r\nThe window of opportunity for greater international\r\ncooperation is wider than at any time since 1945. We must\r\nseize the moment if international cooperation is to take a\r\ndecisive step forward. A reformed and streamlined United\r\nNations, concentrating on the tasks entrusted to it in the\r\nCharter, can make considerable progress towards fulfilling\r\nthe high expectations we place in it today.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Talbak Nazarov.\r\nMr. Nazarov (Tajikistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me first to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail\r\non his election to the post of President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. We consider this to\r\nconstitute recognition by the community of nations of the\r\ngrowing role being played by Malaysia on the world\r\npolitical and economic scenes.\r\nThe Republic of Tajikistan’s accession to full United\r\nNations membership five years ago marked a new page\r\nin the history of my country’s relations with the\r\nOrganization. Five years is, of course, a short period in\r\nhistory, but for our country they have been crucial. For\r\nthe Tajik people, whose history over the past millennium\r\nhas been full of tragic events, they were fraught with\r\nserious ordeals. These years saw both our breakthrough to\r\nsovereignty and one of the most tragic periods of our\r\nmodern history: the civil war. Indeed, the question was\r\nwhether one of the newest Member States was to continue\r\nto exist on the world map.\r\nThe people of Tajikistan answered this question\r\nthemselves, but the historical cost of the survival of the\r\nyoung State, which became the object of massive\r\naggression from united extremist forces, including attacks\r\ncarried out from the southern borders of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), was very\r\nhigh.\r\nIt is already clear today that the conflict imposed on\r\nthe Tajik people — an enormous human tragedy — was\r\naimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of\r\nthe State and interfering with economic growth and\r\nmarket reforms and hence the country’s independent\r\ndevelopment along a general democratic course. The scale\r\nof the conflict and the degree of involvement of forces\r\nfrom the territory of a neighbouring State posed a threat\r\nto peace and security on the Asian continent as a whole.\r\nFortunately, in its difficult struggle for political survival,\r\nTajikistan was not left to fend for itself. The CIS\r\nStates — primarily Russia and the central Asian\r\ncountries, as well as the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nsupported the Republic and continue to do so.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nToday, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan\r\nis concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful\r\naccomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the\r\nsocial and economic infrastructure of the southern part of\r\nthe Republic, which was devastated by the civil war; to\r\nreintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national\r\neconomy on a new basis; and to convert the distorted\r\ncentralized national economy that we inherited into a\r\nmodern market economy.\r\nThese tasks, difficult enough in their own right, are all\r\nthe more complex because of a chronic shortage of our own\r\nfinancial resources. Thanks to the donor States, the United\r\nNations specialized agencies and other international and\r\nregional organizations, Tajikistan continues to receive\r\nhumanitarian support. The overall volume of the assistance\r\nreceived, however, is insufficient, while the economic\r\nsituation inside the country continues to be very\r\ncomplicated.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that, given these\r\ncircumstances, authoritative international financial\r\ninstitutions have been understanding about our growing\r\nneeds. As a result, the Government of Tajikistan, supported\r\nby the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, is\r\nmaking deliberate efforts to intensify the reforms, create a\r\nmarket economy in the country and integrate the national\r\neconomy into the world trade and economic system.\r\nA solid basis for progressive and sustainable\r\ndevelopment is being created in the country step by step.\r\nThat is why the Government of Tajikistan is particularly\r\ninterested in the adoption by the General Assembly at this\r\nsession of decisions dealing with assistance to countries\r\nwith transitional economies, taking into account the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Agenda for Development. We also hope\r\nthat the decisions of the most recent special session of the\r\nCommission for Social Development will be fully\r\nimplemented.\r\nAs the Assembly may know, the Commission\r\nemphasized once again the necessity for United Nations\r\nfinancial organizations to mobilize resources in support of\r\nthe national efforts of the developing countries to\r\nimplement the Copenhagen Declaration on Social\r\nDevelopment and the Programme of Action of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. This important Declaration\r\nacquires special significance on the eve of the first United\r\nNations Decade for the Eradication Poverty (1997-2006).\r\nThe stabilization of Tajikistan’s economy is not only\r\nthe key to satisfying the pressing social and economic needs\r\nof our people, but would without a doubt promote the\r\nprocess of national conciliation, social consolidation, and\r\nthe strong and healthy formation of democratic\r\ninstitutions in the country as a whole.\r\nAs a post-socialist State at the very beginning of its\r\ndemocratic rejuvenation, the Republic of Tajikistan values\r\nhighly the international experience it has accumulated\r\nwithin the United Nations. Such experience helps\r\nGovernments to develop and strengthen new democracies.\r\nDrawing upon this rich international experience, my\r\nGovernment is purposefully taking important\r\nconstitutional steps towards creating an open society.\r\nFirmly and consistently committed to the course of\r\ndemocratic development pursued by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, the\r\nGovernment of my country promotes the involvement of\r\nthe broad mass of the population in social, political and\r\neconomic reform processes through such mechanisms as\r\nreferendums, national elections to representative bodies,\r\nrenovation of the judicial system and every possible\r\nencouragement of openness.\r\nAn important practical step towards the further\r\ndemocratization of society was taken with the adoption of\r\nthe treaty on national reconciliation in Tajikistan, initiated\r\nby the President and social organizations of the country.\r\nThis treaty was signed by the leaders of the absolute\r\nmajority of political parties, public movements, national\r\nassociations and religious communities. We consider it to\r\nbe a universal, basic document of national reconciliation\r\nthat defines viewpoints for the formation of a State\r\nproviding for the equal and full participation of all\r\npolitical and regional forces in national public life.\r\nThe people of Tajikistan made a deliberate choice in\r\nfavour of democratic reforms and they are not going to\r\ngive them up voluntarily. However, the course is full of\r\nobstacles, which my Government is resolved to overcome\r\nin the interests of achieving the main goal: the formation\r\nof a civil society.\r\nOne of the main problems hampering our building of\r\na new society is an undeclared small war in the far south-\r\neast of Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border, which\r\nhas been imposed on the Tajik people by the opposition\r\nIslamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan. The intransigent\r\narmed wing of the opposition is increasing tensions in the\r\ncountry by torpedoing the agreements reached at the inter-\r\nTajik talks. By constantly and flagrantly violating the\r\nTajik-Afghan sector of the southern border of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, it is inflicting pain\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nand suffering on the civil population and causing irreparable\r\ndamage to the unique wildlife of the Pamir region.\r\nThe leadership of Tajikistan believes that the road to\r\npeace in the country lies through the continuation of\r\ndialogue and the resolution of existing differences through\r\nconstitutional legitimacy and only by political means. The\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan sincerely appreciates the active\r\nhumanitarian mediation of the United Nations, which is\r\nsearching for ways to resolve the conflict peacefully. My\r\nGovernment greatly values the personal contribution made\r\nby the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, his\r\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Gerd Merrem, and the United\r\nNations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan to the settlement\r\nof the conflict.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the significant contribution\r\nmade to the peace process by other international\r\norganizations, as well as by the States attending the talks as\r\nobservers.\r\nIn particular I would like to note the constructive role\r\nplayed by the Russian Federation. It has given us\r\nsignificant and considerable assistance in protecting\r\nTajikistan’s border and ensuring security in general. We see\r\nthis assistance as a strategic measure aimed at preventing\r\nthe southern border of the Tajik part of the CIS from being\r\nviolated. This task is being carried out by a group of\r\nRussian border patrol troops in Tajikistan, comprised for\r\nthe most part of Tajik youths, and the collective\r\npeacekeeping forces with the participation of Uzbekistan,\r\nKazakstan and Kyrgyzstan.\r\nIt is appropriate to recall that the leadership of\r\nTajikistan and the States whose military contingents are part\r\nof the collective peacekeeping forces of the CIS have\r\nrepeatedly asked that these forces be granted the status of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation. I do not think this\r\nrequest is any less urgent today.\r\nWe are well aware of the fact that the only\r\nprerequisite for effective dialogue is the moral willingness\r\nof the opposing sides to reach a possible compromise. The\r\nGovernment of Tajikistan has repeatedly demonstrated its\r\ngood will by trying to meet the other side half-way and to\r\nbreathe new life into the negotiating process whenever\r\nnecessary. We will not tire of walking this, the only road to\r\npeace. At the same time, we consider the demands made by\r\nthe opposition for an equal division of power and,\r\nparticularly, the dismantling of existing State bodies as a\r\ncondition for national reconciliation to be unrealistic and\r\ndesigned deliberately to lead to deadlock.\r\nThe Government of Tajikistan is fully determined\r\nlogically to finish what it has started and to find a\r\nmutually acceptable formula for peace in the country.\r\nAnd if the opposition takes a similarly constructive stance\r\nand strictly adheres to the Tehran ceasefire agreement,\r\nthen there is hope that the Ashgabat agreements will lead\r\nto real political results and bring the long-awaited peace\r\nto Tajik soil. A striking illustration of this is the\r\nagreement reached on 16 September this year between the\r\nGovernment Commission and the opposition’s field\r\ncommanders that brought peace, fragile though it may be,\r\nto this long-suffering land.\r\nThe efforts of my Government to achieve peace\r\nwould be even more fruitful were it not for the remaining\r\ntensions in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the situation\r\nis a humanitarian tragedy of a truly global scale. We\r\nwould welcome efforts by United Nations Member States\r\nto find new ways to settle the conflict in Afghanistan. It\r\nis not only our geographical neighbour but also a country\r\nlinked to Tajikistan by centuries-old historical and\r\nspiritual ties. While expressing grave concern at the latest\r\ndevelopments in neighbouring Afghanistan, we support\r\nthe steps taken by the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly aimed at promoting a peaceful resolution of the\r\nAfghan conflict.\r\nThe Republic of Tajikistan, for its part, is ready to\r\njoin forces with other members of the international\r\ncommunity and contribute to this constructive process,\r\nwhich may have a positive influence and help stabilize\r\nthe situation along the Tajik-Afghan border.\r\nFrom this high rostrum, I cannot but express my\r\ngratitude to the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its constructive\r\nand fruitful participation in solving a humanitarian\r\nproblem: that of our refugees who have found themselves\r\nin Afghanistan as a result of the civil war. The three-year\r\nUNHCR operation in Tajikistan has ended with success.\r\nDuring this comparatively short period of time, with\r\nUNHCR assistance in finding a comprehensive solution\r\nto this issue, most Tajik refugees have returned to their\r\nhomeland. With the support of UNHCR, the Government\r\nof Tajikistan renovated about 18,000 houses for the\r\nreturned refugees. Programmes are being implemented, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, to encourage the development of small\r\nenterprises, promoting social and economic conditions that\r\ncan help repatriates gradually to adapt.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund and the World\r\nHealth Organization have made great and invaluable\r\ncontributions to health care and disease prevention for\r\nwomen and children in Tajikistan.\r\nAt the same time, we cannot but be concerned for the\r\nseveral thousand Tajik refugees still in Afghanistan. Their\r\nreturn to the homeland is being prevented by the armed\r\nopposition, which is linking their return to the resolution of\r\npolitical issues not directly related to this purely\r\nhumanitarian act. We hope that, with the international\r\ncommunity’s assistance and the support of the States\r\nconcerned, a rapid and definitive solution can be found to\r\nthis major problem.\r\nIn this regard, I wish to express our support for the\r\ndecisions of the Conference on Refugees, Returnees,\r\nDisplaced Persons and Related Migratory Movements in the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States and Relevant\r\nNeighbouring States held in Geneva in late May this year.\r\nIt is very important that the decisions taken at this session\r\nof the General Assembly support the programme of action\r\nadopted at the Geneva conference.\r\nWe are also concerned at the fact that military training\r\nbases of fighters belonging to the armed Tajik opposition\r\ncontinue to operate, without hindrance, on the territory of\r\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan, itself a country that has\r\nbeen plagued by civil war for almost two decades.\r\nThis is where provocative cross-border sorties are\r\ncarefully planned and new victims of terror and violence,\r\nincluding among the civilian population, are determined.\r\nNor is it merely armed fighters that cross the Tajik-Afghan\r\nborder. Beyond Pyandzh, drug manufacturing is out of\r\ncontrol and drug trafficking and the sales of drugs to other\r\ncountries, even to other continents, are consistently on the\r\nrise.\r\nCriminal elements and groups from certain regions in\r\nAfghanistan illegally circulate arms, thus undermining\r\nTajikistan’s State security. It is well known that terrorists\r\nof every stripe have always fed off the drug trade and\r\nillegal arms sales. We, like other States, are particularly\r\nalarmed at the close relationship between some terrorist\r\norganizations and the illegal drug trade.\r\nDrug addiction has long been one of the most terrible\r\nsocial scourges on Earth. In Tajikistan, which has become\r\none of the world’s “hot spots” in terms of the distribution\r\nof drugs coming from outside the country, we understand\r\nonly too well the danger posed by drug abuse and illegal\r\ntrafficking to people’s lives, health, dignity and economic\r\nprosperity, as well as to the political stability of a State.\r\nThe consequences of these criminal acts can be felt\r\nnot just in Tajikistan or the CIS, but far beyond the\r\nCommonwealth borders. All this poses a real threat to\r\npeace and stability throughout the Central and South\r\nAsian region, including Afghanistan.\r\nThe Government of Tajikistan expresses its grave\r\nconcern at terrorist activity around the world. We need a\r\nunited front to curb the destructive wave of terror and\r\ndrastically intensify the common struggle to prevent\r\nterrorism from emerging in any form. It is particularly\r\nnecessary to create a reliable barrier against terrorists’\r\nattempts to gain access to weapons of mass destruction.\r\nWhile unconditionally condemning all manifestations\r\nof terrorism, the Government of Tajikistan feels that the\r\ntime has come to turn anti-terrorist cooperation under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations to practical action. In this\r\nregard, we must make full use of the resources of\r\nregional organizations.\r\nDuring the half a century of its existence, the United\r\nNations has proved its viability; at the same time,\r\nhowever, it has reached the threshold of certain\r\nindispensable changes in its structure and activities. We\r\nfeel that, in today’s unstable and transitional international\r\nconditions, the role of the United Nations should steadily\r\ngrow.\r\nIn our opinion, it is important to approach reform in\r\na pragmatic way, concentrate on those issues that are ripe\r\nfor resolution and maintain a reasonable balance between\r\ninnovation and those mechanisms that have proved their\r\nefficiency. The most important thing is to enhance\r\ncoordination within the framework of the United Nations;\r\nto focus efforts on such priorities as peacemaking,\r\nhumanitarian crises, human rights, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and support to States with transitional\r\neconomies; and to monitor strictly the use of limited\r\navailable resources.\r\nThe Government of Tajikistan feels that the integral\r\nelement in comprehensive United Nations reform is the\r\nquestion of the further enhancement of the role of the\r\nSecurity Council as the most important instrument for\r\nmaintaining and strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity. It is also our opinion that the expansion and\r\nrenewal of the Council must be carried out in keeping\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nwith Charter criteria for Council membership and the\r\ncurrent status of its permanent members.\r\nWe think that the Security Council would be made\r\nmore representative by adding not only some candidates\r\nfrom among the industrial Powers, such as Germany and\r\nJapan, but also some representatives from Asian, African\r\nand Latin American countries. In this connection, the\r\nproposal made by the delegation of Italy is of great interest.\r\nIn the autumn of 1995, when leaving United Nations\r\nHeadquarters in New York, the leaders of the community\r\nof States once again affirmed the determination of their\r\nGovernments to fight for the realization of our common\r\nideals of peace and development, justice and sovereign\r\nequality and respect for human rights and basic freedoms,\r\nincluding the right to development. At that time, we\r\nadopted a historic Declaration as a commitment to the\r\npresent and future generations of the Earth to exert our\r\njoint efforts to prevent a resurgence of both cold and hot\r\nwars and large-scale and small-scale conflicts in our\r\nglobal world.\r\nThis is why we all have a great deal of creative\r\nwork ahead of us — for the sake of all mankind and for\r\nthe benefit of the future of our planet Earth.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning a change in the programme of\r\nwork of the General Assembly contained in document\r\nA/INF/51/3.\r\nAgenda item 22, entitled, “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States”;\r\nagenda item 25, entitled, “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Caribbean Community”; and\r\nagenda item 28, entitled, “Universal Congress on the\r\nPanama Canal” will be taken up on Thursday, 24 October\r\n1996, in the afternoon, instead of on Wednesday, 23\r\nOctober 1996, in the morning, as originally scheduled.\r\nMay I also remind members that the General\r\nCommittee will meet tomorrow, Tuesday, 8 October\r\n1996, at 9.15 a.m. in Conference Room 3, to consider a\r\nrequest for the inclusion of an additional item entitled,\r\n“Observer status for the International Seabed Authority”,\r\nwhich has been circulated in document A/51/231.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
