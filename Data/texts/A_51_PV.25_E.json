(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is His Excellency\r\nMr. Amdemicael Kahsai, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nEritrea, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Kahsai (Eritrea): Allow me first to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. I wish also to pay tribute\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal, who presided over the fiftieth regular session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe Assembly will agree with me that present-day\r\ninternational relations are characterized by two\r\ncontradictory trends. On the one hand, there is an\r\noverriding desire and wilful movement to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation through the expansion of trade and\r\ninvestment. This trend is inextricably linked to the pursuit\r\nand maintenance of peace and stability. However, parallel\r\nwith and contradicting this positive trend, we see a\r\nproliferation of high- and low-intensity conflicts in various\r\ncorners of the world triggered by different causes. The\r\npursuit of viable mechanisms to reduce and seek a\r\npermanent solution to these conflicts in order to promote\r\ninternational cooperation for the welfare of mankind\r\nremains, therefore, the key challenge that the United\r\nNations will continue to face in the coming years.\r\nThe Horn of Africa region remains, likewise, in the\r\ngrips of this dichotomy. On the positive side, the\r\ncountries of the region are committed to promoting\r\nregional cooperation, and continue to make strenuous\r\nefforts to this end. This is indeed manifested by the\r\nsubstantial progress achieved to date to revitalize the\r\nInter-Governmental Authority on Drought and\r\nDevelopment (IGADD), the regional instrument for\r\nachieving this objective. At the same time, the region\r\ncontinues to bleed due to grave internal conflicts within\r\nsome member States. The painful bloodletting that has\r\ndestroyed the social fabric in Somalia continues unabated;\r\nthe internal conflict in the Sudan and the climate of\r\nregional tension created by the activities of the National\r\nIslamic Front (NIF) regime continues to deteriorate.\r\nThe pursuit of peace and stability, with the attendant\r\nopportunities that this provides for economic and social\r\ndevelopment, have special significance for peoples that\r\nhave suffered the physical and psychological traumas of\r\nwar. In this connection, as the Assembly is aware, my\r\ncountry has borne the brunt of a long war which has\r\nexacted enormous human sacrifices, leaving its economic\r\nand social infrastructure a shambles. Accordingly, peace\r\nis crucial to the young State of Eritrea to heal the scars of\r\nwar, to recoup lost opportunity and to reconstruct what\r\nhas been devastated.\r\nBut my Government’s profound aspirations and\r\ncommitment to the maintenance of peace continue to be\r\nthreatened by the hostile and unprovoked acts of the NIF\r\nregime in the Sudan, whose antagonism and subversion\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nagainst Eritrea began soon after it took power in 1989. I\r\nhardly need emphasize here that the acts of subversion and\r\nState-sponsored terrorism are not directed against Eritrea\r\nalone, but have in fact been adopted as an instrument of\r\npolicy by the NIF in its attempts to destabilize its\r\nneighbours and export its expansionist designs through\r\nsubversion and violence.\r\nIn pursuit of these aims, the NIF regime has propped\r\nup and provided safe haven to assorted terrorists from\r\nvarious countries and facilitated their acts of sabotage and\r\nterror. Khartoum’s barely veiled hand is discernible from\r\nthe litany of border incursions by mercenary groups in a\r\nnumber of countries in the region and acts of naked terror\r\nin the international arena.\r\nI must stress here that my Government has left no\r\nstone unturned in its efforts to reduce and stave off the\r\nclimate of tension provoked by the acts of the NIF regime.\r\nAs a matter of fact, for five long years my Government\r\npursued a policy of constructive engagement, patiently and\r\ntirelessly, hoping against hope that the authorities in\r\nKhartoum would turn back from the dangerous alley that\r\nthey are heading for.\r\nUnfortunately, the language of moderation and peace\r\nonly whetted the NIF’s appetite to spread its subversive\r\ntentacles deeper and wider. In the event, Khartoum not only\r\nrefused to heed these continuous appeals, but escalated its\r\novert acts of terror and subversion beyond limits.\r\nAnother grave matter I wish to bring to the attention\r\nof this Assembly is the maltreatment of Eritrean refugees\r\nat the hands of Sudanese authorities. The NIF regime not\r\nonly is doing whatever it can to obstruct the organized\r\nrepatriation of the refugees to their home country, but is\r\nengaged in reckless and deplorable acts to drive a wedge\r\nbetween the refugees and the people of the Sudan, who\r\nhave offered commendable hospitality during the long years\r\nof war. And when this policy did not work, the NIF regime\r\nbegan subjecting the refugees to arbitrary imprisonment,\r\ntorture, and banishment after confiscation of their property\r\nby its security authorities. Moreover, young refugees were\r\nforcibly conscripted and given military training to be\r\ndeployed in subversive activities across the border.\r\nOrganized repatriation of these refugees, the pilot phase of\r\nwhich has been successfully achieved, is impeded by the\r\nlame excuses the NIF fabricates. All these pressures have\r\ncaused the refugees to return home spontaneously at high\r\nrisk.\r\nAll these acts of hostility perpetrated by the NIF\r\nregime to implement its designs of destabilizing\r\nneighbours should surely be of grave concern to this\r\nAssembly and the international community at large, given\r\ntheir wider regional security ramifications.\r\nAllow me further to recall the incident that erupted\r\nbetween Eritrea and the Republic of Yemen in December\r\n1995, following the latter’s occupation of the Eritrean\r\narchipelago of Hanish-Zuqar, at the southern entrance to\r\nthe Red Sea. Perhaps due to its sensitivity, the incident\r\naroused immediate international concern and mediation\r\nendeavours.\r\nThe Government of Eritrea, which all along had\r\nsought international arbitration to the dispute, promptly\r\naccepted, with full appreciation, the mediation initiatives\r\nof the Ethiopian and Egyptian Governments, and later that\r\nof the United Nations Secretary-General, which greatly\r\nhelped to defuse tensions and paved the way for the\r\npeaceful handling of the dispute. When facilitation by the\r\nFrench Government was proposed, the Eritrean\r\nGovernment accepted it wholeheartedly.\r\nThese decisions were taken by the Eritrean\r\nGovernment against a background of mendacious\r\naccusations and irresponsible campaigns by the Yemeni\r\nauthorities to escalate the situation. The incident was also\r\nfanned by those in certain quarters who sought to serve\r\ntheir vested interests in the troubled waters. However,\r\ngenuine desires and a sincere political will prevailed.\r\nUltimately, restraint and careful handling of the\r\nissue, in addition to positive and constructive regional and\r\ninternational intervention, culminated in the Agreement on\r\nPrinciples, signed by both parties on 21 May 1996 in\r\nParis.\r\nIn this Agreement, both the State of Eritrea and the\r\nRepublic of Yemen unequivocally expressed their desire\r\nto settle their dispute over the Hanish-Zuqar archipelago\r\nby the verdict of a court of arbitration. Developments\r\nsince the signing of the document could be considered\r\ngenerally positive and encouraging. However, allegations\r\nwere made by the Republic of Yemen that Eritrean forces\r\noccupied the island of Lesser Hanish on 10 August 1996,\r\nand the matter was hastily referred to the Security\r\nCouncil. The fact of the matter was that units of the\r\nEritrean forces were on that island both before and after\r\nthe signing of the Agreement on Principles on 21 May\r\n1996. Despite this truth, the Eritrean Government\r\nwithdrew its forces as a gesture of goodwill and in the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\ninterest of the smooth progress of the arbitration process\r\nand to preserve and promote the peace of the region.\r\nThe Eritrean Government has time and again affirmed\r\nits adherence to the Agreement on Principles of 21 May\r\n1996, and expressed its commitment to abide by the\r\ndecisions of the court of arbitration. I am pleased to\r\nunderline that the subsidiary agreement reached between the\r\ntwo sides in Paris last week, on 3 October, will now allow\r\nfor the proceedings of the court of arbitration to start early\r\nnext year.\r\nThe agonizing and intractable reality in Somalia\r\ncannot but impel the international community to search for\r\nways and means of expediting an end to this long, drawn-\r\nout tragedy. The complexity of the situation is too apparent\r\nto require more elaboration here. But it is clear that no\r\namount of well-meaning external support will succeed in\r\nrestoring normalcy to Somalia unless the Somalis\r\nthemselves take stock of the senseless bloodshed that has\r\ntorn the country apart and produce what it takes to forge\r\npeace and national reconciliation. Admittedly, the countries\r\nof the region could have played a more catalytic part in this\r\nmulti-pronged effort. The lack of a consistent and\r\ncoordinated regional and international initiative, however,\r\nmay entail more preoccupying negative developments.\r\nIndeed, there are indications these days of a growing\r\ninvolvement of various external actors that seem bent on\r\nexploiting the vacuum to promote their hidden agendas.\r\nSomalia is in fact drifting towards becoming fertile ground\r\nfor extremist groups. For the sake of the Somalis, and in\r\nthe interest of regional peace and stability, it is vital that\r\nthese trends be checked before it is too late and that the\r\nregional initiative be resuscitated.\r\nThe recent developments in the Middle East which\r\nappear to have cast some shadows on the Oslo agreement\r\nare naturally a matter of preoccupation to all those who\r\nwish to see an enduring settlement to the conflict between\r\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. Whatever the shortcomings\r\nof the agreement, there can be no alternative to the peace\r\nprocess. My Government therefore appeals to both sides to\r\npersevere in the process of dialogue and negotiations so that\r\na lasting peace that ensures the well-being of all the peoples\r\nof the region will be assured.\r\nIn conclusion, we share the views of many Member\r\nStates on the imperative of restructuring the decision-\r\nmaking bodies of the United Nations, particularly the\r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council continues to play a\r\nvitally important role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. It is my delegation’s belief that now\r\nis the opportune moment to revitalize it, make it more\r\ndemocratic and improve its value, effectiveness and\r\nlegitimacy so as to make it reflect the universal character\r\nof the Organization. Powerful and convincing arguments\r\nhave been made by many speakers to the effect that, at\r\npresent, the Security Council is neither equitable nor\r\nrepresentative. The circumstances of international politics\r\nhave altered so fundamentally that there are compelling\r\nreasons for change.\r\nIn spite of the broadly shared wish for reform,\r\ndiscussions so far have not really come close to the\r\ngeneral agreement needed. It is our firm belief that\r\nflexibility and compromise will be necessary. There are\r\na number of interesting elements in the proposals, to\r\nwhich thorough attention should be given so that we can\r\ntry to bring about the necessary change.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai.\r\nMr. Ghafoorzai (Afghanistan): At the outset, allow\r\nme, Sir, to express my delegation’s congratulations upon\r\nyour election to the high position of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nThe Afghan trauma, which was imposed by others\r\nand endured by the Afghan people, continues to have\r\ndisturbing consequences for our nation. For the world, it\r\nmay be just another trouble spot. But for Afghans, it\r\nmeans agony, pain, loss, psychological trauma and an\r\nunknown future. We must not forget that there is still\r\nhope. It lies in the international connection between me\r\nand other representatives and, through them, to their\r\ncountrymen. The United Nations was built on that dream\r\nand today, that connection is once again being made —\r\nit is the fifty-first connection.\r\nTwo tragic dates will stand out in the recent history\r\nof Afghanistan: 27 December 1979 and 27 September\r\n1996. Both were black days that trigger bitter memories\r\nin the minds of all patriotic Afghans. The first date\r\nreminds them of the occupation by the former Soviet\r\nUnion and the second, of another occupying force, backed\r\nby another neighbour.\r\nThe force occupying parts of our homeland today is\r\nknown as the Taliban — a name that became very\r\nfamiliar to the General Assembly at the previous session.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nWhat was the Taliban’s first act when it captured Kabul? It\r\nwas to attack not a military garrison, but the United Nations\r\noffice in Afghanistan. Its first act was to breach the sanctity\r\nof the United Nations compound, in violation of all\r\naccepted international norms and laws.\r\nThat is the Taliban. As European Commissioner,\r\nEmma Bonino, said yesterday, the Taliban is a force that\r\nthreatens to take Afghanistan back to the dark ages.\r\nNumerous international media reports from Kabul draw a\r\npicture of an organization supported from abroad, imposing\r\na draconian system on a terrified people. The Taliban have\r\nordered schools and universities to close and stopped all\r\neducation and employment for women. There are numerous\r\nreports from the media, the United States authorities and\r\nthe United Nations on the role of the Taliban in a $75\r\nbillion heroin export industry in Afghanistan.\r\nOn 1 October 1996, The New York Times said that the\r\n1 million people who live in Kabul alone had been plunged\r\ninto the\r\n“labyrinth that is Taliban rule”.\r\nOn 3 October 1996 the Reuters news agency said that,\r\nwhile the Taliban has tried to seek international recognition,\r\nit has been greeted with “suspicion — and fear”. In just\r\ntheir first week in Kabul, the Taliban earned the\r\ncondemnation of Amnesty International.\r\nThese are not the words of the Afghan Government\r\ndescribing the Taliban occupation — these are the words of\r\nAmnesty International:\r\n“Despite statements from their leadership\r\nsuggesting moderation, it is clear that Taleban guards\r\nare busily implementing a reign of terror in Kabul ...\r\nFamilies are afraid to go out into the streets, afraid to\r\nanswer their doors, and afraid that their loved ones\r\nwill suffer the brutal consequence”\r\nof Taliban rule. Amnesty International accuses the Taliban\r\nof seizing, in house-to-house searches in the capital, up to\r\n1,000 prisoners, who were forced to walk over the front-\r\nline minefields.\r\nFrench television showed the Taliban storming into the\r\nKabul museum, where they destroyed many artifacts, relics\r\nand statues that were unique. Those artifacts and statues\r\nbelonged to the Buddhist era and are irreplaceable.\r\nI am talking about the Taliban, which is\r\noverwhelmed by foreign-fomented hatred, mandated by a\r\nforeign-crafted agenda and committed to the annihilation\r\nof the political, social and economic fabric of\r\nAfghanistan. It is an organization whose display of terror\r\nin Kabul breaks all records. In short, the Taliban are\r\nmercenaries — an illegal and illegitimate force that has\r\nbeen imposed on the Afghan people.\r\nOnce again, foreign interference is the main cause of\r\nthe continued conflict in Afghanistan. The current state of\r\nterror and chaos, touching the lives of every living soul\r\nin Kabul, is the direct consequence of that interference.\r\nWe have at our disposal hard evidence that we will\r\nsubmit in due course to the Security Council for\r\nappropriate consideration. What could prove that there is\r\nforeign interference better than the foreign militias, which\r\ninclude some officers, who were recently captured on the\r\nbattlefield by the armed forces of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan?\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan firmly believes that\r\nthe so-called Taliban is a perfect example of a mercenary\r\nforce as defined by the International Convention against\r\nthe Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of\r\nMercenaries, adopted by the General Assembly in 1989.\r\nWe are not denying the existence among the Taliban of\r\nAfghan youths who were raised across the border and\r\nattended religious schools there, but it cannot be stated\r\ntoo clearly that the main corps of the Taliban military\r\nstaff consists of officers and militia forces from beyond\r\nour borders, paid by military-industrial magnates trying to\r\noverthrow the Islamic State of Afghanistan.\r\nThe United Nations General Assembly, on 21\r\nDecember 1995, adopted a resolution which condemned\r\nany State that permits or tolerates the recruitment,\r\nfinancing, training, assembly, transit and use of\r\nmercenaries with the objective of overthrowing the\r\nGovernment of any State Member of the United Nations,\r\nespecially that of a developing country.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations, in various\r\nArticles, urges all Members to develop friendly relations\r\namong themselves and to refrain in their international\r\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the\r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any State.\r\nOn the occasion of the commemoration of the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations on 24\r\nOctober 1970, the General Assembly approved the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nDeclaration on Principles of International Law concerning\r\nFriendly Relations and Cooperation among States. The first\r\nprinciple declares that States shall refrain in their\r\ninternational relations from the threat or use of force\r\nagainst the territorial integrity or political independence of\r\nany State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the\r\npurposes of the United Nations.\r\nThe Seventh Islamic Summit Conference in\r\nCasablanca on 13 December 1994, the Conference of Heads\r\nof State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries on\r\n18 October of 1995 in Cartagena de Indias, the General\r\nAssembly resolution on Afghanistan of 19 December 1995\r\nand the Twenty-third Islamic Conference of Foreign\r\nMinsters on 9 December 1995 held in Conakry, Guinea, all\r\ninsist vigorously on the principle of non-intervention and\r\nrespect for the territorial integrity and independence of\r\nAfghanistan and on a peace process based on genuine intra-\r\nAfghan dialogue.\r\nIt is a matter of great disappointment that persistent\r\nappeals to the United Nations made by the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan to send a fact-finding mission to inquire into\r\nand investigate the level, degree and nature of foreign\r\nintervention in Afghanistan remain unanswered.\r\nLast year, we presented facts about the Taliban from\r\nthis rostrum. Our plight went unheard. We are afraid, given\r\nthe accounts of documented facts by the press and our clear\r\nstand on the legacy of the Taliban, that our plight might go\r\nunheard once more. That will be even more catastrophic\r\nthan the Taliban take-over itself.\r\nThe latest reports, as recent as yesterday, reveal some\r\nshocking realities and facts about the Taliban attacks on the\r\nareas surrounding Kabul, the capital. Allow me to unveil\r\nthe screened and concealed crime that the Taliban, assisted\r\nby their outside sponsors, committed very recently. Exactly\r\n26 days ago, on 11 September 1996, intelligence sources of\r\nthe Defence Ministry of the Islamic State of Afghanistan\r\nintercepted and recorded a Taliban radio transmission\r\nbetween Nangarhar and Kandahar. That transmission says\r\nthe following:\r\n“Give regards to the victorious Mullah Shukrullah ...\r\nTell him that new APR weapons have already been\r\nbrought to Kandahar. You should immediately send\r\nthese arms, which are gas weapons, through Torkhan\r\ntowards Nangarhar because we have organized a\r\ngroup of Taliban with special gear and are waiting for\r\nthe said weapons. We can capture large areas with\r\na single round.”\r\nOn 17 September, just six days later, I personally\r\ntook this report, submitted to me by the Ministry of\r\nDefence, and presented it to the State Supreme Council,\r\nconvened under the leadership of Mr. Rabbani, the\r\nPresident of Afghanistan, in Blandage bunker, just north\r\nof Kabul, the capital. I still remember an overwhelming\r\nstillness occupied the room after I submitted the report.\r\nAfter a brief calmness, a member of the Council\r\nremarked that maybe the report had been passed around\r\nto demoralize State troops; hence, not enough attention\r\nwas paid to the issue.\r\nYesterday, we obtained a shocking — and I repeat,\r\nshocking — report from the headquarters of the\r\nGovernment in Taloqan, which reminded me of the\r\nSupreme Council meeting. Officials of the Islamic State\r\nof Afghanistan recorded radio conversations by the\r\nTaliban in the front line around evening on 26 September,\r\nthe night before the Taliban take-over of Kabul. The\r\nfollowing assurances were reported:\r\n“Reassure the leaders that the new weapons have\r\nhad good results in Lata Band, Bande-Ghazi and\r\nPuli-Charkhi.”\r\nThese areas, for the information of the\r\nrepresentatives, are located to the east of Kabul, the\r\ncapital.\r\nMore staggering realities are provided by the\r\neyewitness reports of those who saw the areas afterwards.\r\nThese eyewitnesses have reported that they saw most of\r\nthe corpses of the Government troops laying on the\r\nground without any sign of injury from a bullet or arsenal\r\npenetration in their bodies. However, they did reveal that\r\nthey had noticed that the Government troops had bled\r\nfrom their noses, eyes and ears. Mr. Muslim, a veteran\r\ncommander of the Government, who witnessed similar\r\nsituations during the Soviet occupation, has remarked that:\r\n“The Taliban advance in the front line completely\r\nsurprised me. I then realized that the Taliban must\r\nbe in possession of some kind of weapons more\r\nadvanced than we had seen, possessed or known.”\r\nMr. Muslim, the commander, continues:\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\n“Chemical weapons hadn’t crossed my mind until\r\nthe evening of 26 September during the Taliban’s\r\nfierce attack on Lata Band. I received a radio\r\ntransmission that a large number of our men were\r\nbeing lost and even when I commanded the rest to\r\nretreat, I heard no reply. I contacted my headquarters.\r\nI was ordered to examine the front line. One hour had\r\npassed since my initial contact with the front line\r\nwhen I arrived there. Then I saw Commander Saboor,\r\nlying dead on the battle ground. I only noticed blood\r\naround his nose and ears. Saboor was a close friend of\r\nmine. Suddenly, I had a flashback of the Red Army\r\nusing similar weapons during the jihad. I really\r\nwanted to take his body, which had no trace of\r\nexternal injury, back with me. But the intensity of\r\nfighting did not give me the chance.”\r\nBased on this account, it is the strong conviction of\r\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan that the foreign sponsors\r\nof the Taliban have provided them with some type of\r\ninternationally banned gas or chemical weapon which were\r\nused in the Taliban onslaught for the capture of Kabul, the\r\ncapital, where they encountered strong resistance.\r\nWe are bringing this tragic episode to the attention of\r\nthis Assembly and therefore appeal to the international\r\ncommunity immediately to assign a team of inquiry to\r\ninvestigate the case to which I have referred.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan has continuously\r\nprovided information to the United Nations Special Mission\r\nand to the Security Council about the military acts of the\r\nTaliban, which have systematically refused to accept the\r\nUnited Nations peace process.\r\nIn a letter to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations dated 5 September 1995 (S/1995/767), the\r\nGovernment of Afghanistan warned the international\r\ncommunity about the dangers of the fragmentation and\r\ndisintegration of Afghanistan and of the possibility of the\r\nTaliban military advances getting out of control.\r\nIn the letter to the Secretary-General dated 14\r\nSeptember 1995, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\r\nforecasted\r\n“the outcome of this new tension as alarming and\r\nperilous”\r\nand earnestly called for the prompt dispatching\r\n“of a fact-finding mission to western Afghanistan in\r\norder to report during the consultations to the\r\nSecurity Council”. (S/1995/795, p. 2)\r\nThe Secretary-General, in a letter dated 22\r\nSeptember 1995, assured that,\r\n“The United Nations remains committed to the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan\r\nand opposed to all external interference in your\r\ncountry. I am using the mandates entrusted to me by\r\nthe Member States to do all I can to resolve the\r\nsources of conflict which contribute to instability in\r\nAfghanistan. I shall continue to pursue a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the overall peace\r\nprocess, in which the Special Mission will continue\r\nto play the main United Nations role. I ask that you\r\ncontinue to cooperate with it.”\r\nIn a letter dated 27 September 1995 to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Islamic State of Afghanistan stated that,\r\n“Taliban not only undermined peace and\r\ntranquillity in the western parts of the country, but\r\nin the meantime, posed an external practical menace\r\nto the territorial integrity of Afghanistan.”\r\n(S/1995/823, annex, p. 3)\r\nand that,\r\n“the most reasonable and practical way to peace, and\r\nappropriate atmosphere for a peaceful transfer of\r\npower to an elected authority enjoying the\r\nconfidence of the people, is first and foremost the\r\nneed to ease off the present crisis of confidence\u0027”.\r\n(ibid.)\r\nIn the general debate of 4 October 1995, we declared\r\nthat attempts by\r\n“reactionary groups to destabilize a moderate Islamic\r\nsystem which believes in democracy and human\r\nrights, are wrong in their assessments and\r\ncalculations. Such foreign circles may think that\r\nafter the usurpation of power by the Taliban all will\r\ngo well for them. In fact, they will add a further\r\nproblem, especially by bringing onto the scene a\r\nfaction which has no factual presence on\r\nAfghanistan’s political scene. These circles should\r\nbe aware that the peace and security in the capital,\r\nthe actual relative peace and stability in the country\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nand in the region, would be jeopardized by such an\r\nerroneous miscalculation. The same error was made\r\nby the former Soviet Union in 1979.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 19th meeting, p. 10)\r\nAs far as the activities of the United Nations Special\r\nMission are concerned, we suggested, in a letter dated 30\r\nSeptember 1995, that the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\n“and those of Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri, Head of\r\nthe United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan,\r\nwould benefit from the establishment of a contact\r\ngroup on Afghanistan composed of States, but not the\r\nones immediately involved, as well as of interested\r\norganizations.” (A/50/510, annex, p. 2)\r\nIn a letter dated 12 October 1995, we warned that,\r\n“The different leaders of the Taliban have several\r\ntimes declared their rejection of the United Nations\r\nSpecial Mission’s action in proposing to them to\r\naccept a ceasefire. They have also rejected the\r\nproposals for peace talks with other parties to the\r\nconflict.” (S/1995/866, annex, p. 2)\r\nIn a letter dated 12 November 1995, we informed the\r\nSecretary-General that,\r\n“On 11 November 1995, the Taliban launched as\r\nmany as 170 rockets on the civilian-populated sectors\r\nof Kabul, as a result of which 37 innocent lives were\r\nlost and more than 52 civilians wounded, while\r\nimmense damage was inflicted upon public property.”\r\n(A/50/748, annex, p. 2)\r\nThis is why in a letter dated 16 November 1995\r\n(A/50/760) addressed to the Secretary General, the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan inquired about the identity of the\r\nTaliban, their ideology and goals, their rejection of the\r\npeace process and their negative attitude towards the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs a result of the heavy bombardment of the capital\r\nby the Taliban on 26 November 1995, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral expressed his concern about the escalation of\r\nfighting and called upon all parties to cooperate with the\r\nefforts of the United Nations Special Mission, then headed\r\nby Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri, aimed at achieving an\r\nimmediate ceasefire and promoting negotiations among the\r\nparties on a transitional mechanism for the transfer of\r\npower, to achieve a just and durable settlement acceptable\r\nto all Afghans.\r\nDuring 1996 Afghanistan continued to keep the\r\nUnited Nations well informed about the atrocities\r\ncommitted by the Taliban in a letter dated 19 January\r\n1996 (S/1996/44).\r\nOn 9 April 1996 the Security Council held two\r\nmeetings on Afghanistan. During the meetings the\r\ndelegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan provided\r\nadequate information on the role of the so-called Taliban\r\nin causing turmoil in Afghanistan and threatening the\r\npeace and stability of the region. This was recognized by\r\nthe Security Council in a statement to the press on 13\r\nDecember 1995.\r\nIn a letter dated 22 August 1996 addressed to the\r\nSecretary General, the President of the Security Council\r\nstated that the members of Security Council,\r\n“express their strong view that the warring parties\r\nshould renounce the use of force and settle their\r\ndifferences by peaceful means, through negotiations.\r\n“The members of the Security Council are\r\nconvinced that the main responsibility for finding a\r\npolitical solution to the conflict lies with the parties\r\nand that all States must refrain from interference.”\r\n(S/1996/683, first and second paragraphs)\r\nThe Taliban have consistently taken a rejectionist\r\nattitude and still act against the letter and the spirit of all\r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions and\r\ndecisions.\r\nGiven this account, I must say that this is the time\r\nto look back and see who is responsible for the ongoing\r\nhuman tragedy in Afghanistan. Was it not the lack of any\r\nappropriate response by this Organization to the\r\nintransigent attitude of the Taliban that encouraged and\r\nenabled them to see the tunnel wide open and to pursue\r\ntheir designs crafted by military-industrial magnates from\r\nabroad?\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan had continuously\r\nwarned the United Nations about the possible outcome.\r\nWho is to blame, and could we consider it a conspiracy\r\nof indifference or a conspiracy of victimization?\r\nRegardless of which one it may be, the blood of Afghans\r\nhas been spilled. One thing manifested by the indifference\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nthus far is that Afghan blood is not cheap; rather, it is\r\nworthless.\r\nLet us go back to the drastic events that took place\r\nduring the last couple of weeks. The Government forces\r\nevacuated the capital in order to prevent a bloodbath. The\r\nTaliban invaded Kabul on the morning of 27 September\r\n1996. The Government authorities relocated their\r\nheadquarters and offices in Taloqan, the capital of the\r\nnorthern province of Takhar.\r\nResistance against the Taliban is not limited only to\r\nthe Panjshir Valley, where the Taliban are conducting\r\nwidespread and extensive battles, targeting civilian areas. In\r\nmany other parts of Afghanistan, under the rule of the\r\nTaliban, there exists the potential for resistance. Soon we\r\nwill hear about uprisings.\r\nIn today’s circumstances, the objectives of the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan have not changed, and I would like to\r\nemphasize once again our firm commitment to General\r\nAssembly resolution 50/88 on Afghanistan, which was\r\nadopted by consensus on 19 December 1995.\r\nThe provisional setback of one party in the conflict\r\nand the territorial gain of one side could not mean that\r\npeace would prevail in the country. Military occupation\r\ncannot bring about conflict resolution. On the contrary, the\r\nescalation of tension once again necessitates a negotiated\r\nsettlement of the conflict through the mechanism\r\nformulated in operative paragraph 4 of resolution 50/88 B\r\nof 19 December 1995. This provides a solution to the crisis\r\nin Afghanistan through the United Nations peace process.\r\nA ranking United Nations official expressed his\r\nconcern by stating in The Los Angeles Times of 5 October\r\n1996,\r\n“It’s frightening [that] this is going to be the\r\nGovernment, because these men have obviously had\r\nno experience but fighting.”\r\nThe Taliban, who have invaded the capital city of\r\nKabul with cross-border military assistance, will not be able\r\nto ensure the national unity of Afghanistan, especially in\r\nthe light of what they have done during the first days of\r\ntheir military rule in the capital. The Taliban, in spite of\r\nbeing Pashtuns, neither agree with the majority of Pashtuns\r\nof the country nor with Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmen,\r\nBaluchis, Nooristanis and others.\r\nThe Afghan leaders, intellectuals and scholars cannot\r\nagree with the regressive and backward views of the\r\nTaliban. Many religious leaders of the country do not\r\napprove of their attitude and deem it incompatible with\r\nthe needs of Muslims in the modern world. They all\r\nconsider them unacceptable tools of foreign intervention.\r\nThe military rule of the Taliban must not be\r\nconsidered final or accomplished. Those foreign quarters\r\nwhich have provided financial and military assistance to\r\nthe Taliban will not be able to subsidize and finance their\r\nrule permanently.\r\nThe Taliban are lacking any vision or ability for the\r\nobjective of economic and social rehabilitation in\r\nAfghanistan. They lack any coherent and systematic\r\nthinking or projection of the vast needs of today’s\r\nAfghanistan. Many of their leaders consider the teachings\r\nof modern science and technology contrary to religion.\r\nThey consider science to be sacrilege. The Taliban, who\r\nstill believe the earth is flat, are not the people for\r\nAfghanistan, not when we are about to enter the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nYet the outside sponsors of the Taliban are\r\nattempting to cover up their actual identity and nature,\r\nthus soliciting a kind of legitimacy for this illegitimate,\r\nobscurantist and terrorist group. Any relation established\r\nwith the Taliban may be interpreted by the Taliban as\r\ntolerance by the international community. Allowing this\r\nto happen would be an affront to the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations, a seal of approval for terrorism, a\r\nlegitimization of foreign intervention and, indeed, an\r\ninsult to the human conscience.\r\nIn the name of the Islamic State of Afghanistan and\r\nthe victimized Afghan nation, I express gratitude to all\r\nthose countries that have expressed their concern and\r\ndisapproval of the occupation of the Afghan capital,\r\nKabul, by the Taliban, and the rule of terror in that city.\r\nDays after the occupation of Kabul, on 2 October\r\n1996, the Coordination Meeting of Foreign Ministers of\r\nthe member States of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), at which I had the honour to speak,\r\nconvened at the United Nations in New York. In a final\r\ncommuniqué, they expressed\r\n“the hope that the Afghan parties will peacefully\r\nresolve their political differences and collectively\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nwork for the restoration of peace and stability in the\r\ncountry”.\r\nThe practical solution to the Afghan problem needs to\r\ninclude the following elements, in conformity with General\r\nAssembly resolution 50/88 B of 19 December 1995 on the\r\nquestion of Afghanistan: first, an immediate cessation of\r\narmed conflict and the declaration of a ceasefire; secondly,\r\nan invitation to all Afghan parties to the negotiating table,\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and with the\r\ncooperation of the OIC; thirdly, an agreement on the\r\ncomposition and establishment of a transitional Government\r\nof national unity and the creation of a credible, authoritative\r\nbody to which power would immediately be transferred;\r\nand, fourthly, the consolidation of the political process in\r\norder to ascertain the views of the people and solve the\r\nproblem through elections or through the convening of the\r\ntraditional Grand Assembly.\r\nOur basic views and main objectives are as follows:\r\nthe re-establishment of peace and stability, along with the\r\ncreation of conditions conducive to ensuring that the\r\npeoples of Afghanistan can live, in an atmosphere of law\r\nand order, on the basis of democratic values and respect for\r\nhuman rights, as required by an authentic and truthful\r\nvision of high Islamic principles; and the establishment of\r\na strong central Government on the basis of agreement\r\namong all Afghan sides that have the capacity to mobilize\r\nmasses and are able to secure the achievement of these\r\ngoals. This will allow Afghanistan to become once again a\r\npositive factor for peace and stability in the region to which\r\nit belongs.\r\nOnly a transitional Government of national unity\r\nwould be able to secure the national unity of the country\r\nand to allow the launching of the major task of\r\nreconstructing and rehabilitating Afghanistan. Such a goal\r\ncould not be achieved without the full participation of the\r\nintellectuals, scientists, experts and technocrats of\r\nAfghanistan, many of whom now live abroad. We are\r\nexpecting all countries that are in favour of peace and\r\nstability in Afghanistan to assist our people in order to\r\nachieve these noble objectives.\r\nUpon adopting the Charter of the United Nations 51\r\nyears ago in the city of San Francisco, the founding fathers\r\nof this global establishment declared the United Nations to\r\nbe based on the sovereign equality of all States. They did\r\nthis at a time when this principle was an ideal. The struggle\r\nfor freedom by many nations, together with millions of\r\nsacrifices, on the one hand, and the need in the twentieth\r\ncentury for natural interdependence between the members\r\nof this global family, on the other, proved more than ever\r\nthe righteousness of this principle.\r\nIt is apropos in this connection to quote His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hervé de Charette, the Foreign Minister\r\nof France, who on 25 September stated from this rostrum:\r\n“If we are not careful, we are going to be living in\r\na world without criteria, without values, without\r\nreferences, in which some — the strongest and\r\nrichest — will be in a position to decide alone on\r\nthe future of the planet.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 8th meeting, p. 18)\r\nThe President: I now call on the First Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Eriya Kategaya.\r\nMr. Kategaya (Uganda): It is a pleasure and an\r\nhonour for me to address this Assembly. From this lofty\r\nrostrum, the nations of the world speak to one another as\r\nmembers of one global community, irrespective of size\r\nand differences. The United Nations is today the best\r\nhope for a better future for humankind. What we do here\r\nmust therefore contribute positively and effectively\r\ntowards the achievement of the noble purposes and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.\r\nPermit me, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of\r\nUganda, to express how pleased we are at your election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession. Your well-deserved election is a great honour to\r\nyour country, Malaysia, with which Uganda enjoys very\r\ncordial bilateral relations. I wish to pledge our full\r\nsupport to you, Sir, and to affirm our confidence in your\r\nability to guide our deliberations to a successful\r\nconclusion. Allow me also to pay a special tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal, for the able manner in which he presided over\r\nthe work of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI salute our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali, for his commitment and dedication to the global\r\nmission of the United Nations during the past five years.\r\nThe United Nations continues to be confronted with\r\nthe challenge of redressing the development disparities\r\nthat exist among nations, particularly between the few\r\nrich countries and the majority of impoverished ones. For\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nthe latter, these disparities are manifest in widespread\r\npoverty and the degradation of their ecosystems. They are\r\nalso a major cause of the spiral of violence and internal\r\nconflicts, with their attendant suffering and destruction.\r\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, these\r\nproblems have regional as well as global consequences. It\r\nwould therefore be wishful thinking to treat them as if they\r\nwere a concern of only the affected countries and regions.\r\nThey must be addressed through global approaches and\r\nstrategies that ensure lasting solutions.\r\nWe note that present advances in transport,\r\ncommunications and information technology have resulted\r\nin the increasing globalization of the world economy. Both\r\nliberalization and globalization offer opportunities as well\r\nas challenges within and among nations. These twin\r\nphenomena have, in addition, deepened the marginalization\r\nof some regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This\r\nprocess could breed further polarization within countries,\r\nwith very destructive and destabilizing consequences. We\r\nwish to underscore the continuing relevance of\r\nmultilateralism and international cooperation as\r\nprerequisites for equitable global growth and development\r\nand for addressing the negative consequences of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe increasing trend towards unfair trading practices\r\nand conflicts in international trade is a matter of serious\r\nconcern for us. We are witnessing situations in which\r\ndeveloping countries are pushed to open up their markets,\r\nostensibly to advance free trade and competition, while at\r\nthe same time developed countries practice managed trade\r\nand limit access to some export products from developing\r\ncountries. This contradiction is unhealthy for the world\r\neconomy.\r\nThe establishment of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) in 1994 as an entity to act as a custodian and\r\nguarantor of a rules-based multilateral trading system is a\r\npositive development. We therefore welcome the convening\r\nof the first Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade\r\nOrganization in Singapore in December 1996. The Meeting\r\nshould, in our opinion, give a clear policy direction to the\r\nWTO for the next two years on measures to redress\r\nimbalances existing in the present multilateral trading\r\nsystem, which are to the disadvantage of many developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed ones.\r\nThe Meeting should therefore give high priority to\r\nundertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation\r\nof the Uruguay Round agreements, with a view to\r\nadopting specific and concrete measures to obviate\r\nadverse effects to the least developed countries and net\r\nfood-importing developing countries arising from the\r\nimplementation of the agreements; reverse the\r\nmarginalization of the least developed countries; and\r\nstrengthen their capacity to compete in the global\r\neconomy. These measures must include long-term\r\nfinancial and technical support, the transfer of technology\r\nas critical elements for the effective implementation of the\r\nUruguay agreements and in the improvement of the trade\r\nperformance of developing countries.\r\nWith regard to the proposal that the Meeting address\r\nissues outside the WTO built-in agenda, we would prefer\r\nto benefit first from the analytical advice of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development on the\r\npolicy implications of such issues to international trade\r\nbefore they are taken up by the WTO. In our view, the\r\nMeeting should focus on issues relating to the full\r\nimplementation of agreed commitments, such as the\r\nprovision of financial, technical and technological support\r\nto developing countries, as well as those aimed at\r\nstemming and reversing the distortive factors to trade.\r\nThe increasing role of transnational corporations in\r\nthe international trade in goods and services and in the\r\nflow of private capital has inordinately enhanced their\r\ncontrol over resources and the transfer of technology and\r\nknow-how in developing countries. In some cases, this\r\ncontrol is beyond the capacity of many developing\r\ncountries to check. As the influence of these corporations\r\ngrows with globalization, there is an urgent need to\r\nelaborate and adopt an effective and legally-binding\r\ninternational code of conduct to regulate the activities and\r\ninfluence of transnational corporations.\r\nMr. Turnquest (Bahamas), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe are committed to subregional and regional\r\ncooperation and integration. Within the East African\r\nsubregion, we have participated actively in the revival of\r\nEast African cooperation, in the strengthening of the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, and in\r\nintensifying efforts to make operational the Abuja Treaty\r\nestablishing the African Economic Community. It is our\r\nbelief that enhanced subregional and regional cooperation\r\nand integration are critical to complement South-South\r\ncooperation and international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. It is also a means of enhancing\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\ncompetitiveness and thereby improving our performance in\r\nthe world economy. In efforts to further strengthen\r\ncooperation in East Africa, we propose the establishment of\r\na cooperation arrangement between the East African\r\nCommunity and the United Nations. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to support these efforts.\r\nThe magnitude of debt and its servicing obligations\r\ncontinues to impose a serious obstacle to our development\r\nefforts. As of March 1996, for example, Uganda’s total\r\nexternal indebtedness stood at $3.2 billion — which\r\nrepresented 67.5 per cent of its gross domestic product —\r\nof which 75 per cent was owed to multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions. Debt-servicing was $141 million, or 27 per cent\r\nof export earnings. Projected debt-servicing for the 1996-\r\n1997 fiscal year is $184 million, or 35.8 per cent of export\r\nearnings. This precarious situation is compounded by the\r\ncurrent rigorous debt-repayment enforcement regime\r\npursued by creditor multilateral financial institutions.\r\nUganda is committed to fulfilling its debt obligations\r\nwithin the means available to it. In this regard, a\r\nmultilateral debt fund has been established to offset the debt\r\nowed to the International Development Association, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the African Development\r\nBank’s African Development Fund. We are grateful to all\r\nbilateral donors who have continued to support and make\r\ndirect contributions to the fund. We also appeal to other\r\ndonors to join in this worthy endeavour in order to augment\r\nthe resources of the fund, which are still very low.\r\nTo complement these efforts, we make a special\r\nappeal to the international community, and particularly to\r\nthe multilateral financial institutions, to adopt concrete\r\nmeasures to effect a drastic reduction of external\r\nindebtedness of least developed countries and other severely\r\nindebted developing countries. In this regard, we commend\r\nas a first step the debt relief initiatives currently in place,\r\nsuch as the Naples Terms. In our view, however, these\r\nmeasures remain grossly inadequate to have any meaningful\r\nimpact. There is therefore a need to augment them with\r\nadditional measures that substantially reduce all types of\r\ndebts, including those which entail debt write-offs or\r\nconverting part or all of our debt into grants.\r\nWe note with appreciation the recent measures by the\r\nBretton Woods institutions to put in place measures for debt\r\nrelief. We urge the dominant shareholders to support these\r\nmeasures.\r\nAfrican countries, including Uganda, continue to be\r\nadversely affected by record-low levels of export\r\ncommodity earnings. The situation is aggravated by tariff\r\nand non-tariff barriers imposed by our trading partners on\r\nour semi-processed and processed export products and by\r\ndeclining terms of trade due to increased prices of\r\nimported manufactured goods and services. We urge the\r\nadoption of concrete support measures to improve our\r\nexport earnings. This could include assistance in the areas\r\nof horizontal and vertical diversification of our\r\neconomies, as well as capacity-building.\r\nToday is World Habitat Day. It is a day for the\r\ninternational community to reflect on and reaffirm its\r\ncommitment to the plight of the one billion people in all\r\nparts of the world who lack adequate shelter and basic\r\nservices, such as safe water supplies and sanitation\r\nfacilities. It is also a day to dedicate ourselves to the\r\nobjective of finding lasting solutions to the problems of\r\nhomelessness and other social ills associated with rapid\r\nurbanization.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nremains a formidable challenge for the United Nations.\r\nEfforts in this regard continue to be undermined by\r\nconflicts and tensions arising from inadequate political\r\nleadership that cannot correctly handle ethnic, religious\r\nand social differences in those affected areas. These have\r\nundermined the rule of law, peace and security, and have\r\ncontributed to untold suffering in many of the affected\r\ncountries.\r\nIn Africa, civil strife and internal conflicts, with their\r\nattendant consequences, are afflicting several countries to\r\nvarying degrees. For instance, we are gravely concerned\r\nby the suffering imposed on the people of northern\r\nUganda by renegade groups. These terrorist acts must be\r\nstopped forthwith for the sake of peace and security in\r\nour subregion.\r\nThe conflict in Burundi is a serious threat to the\r\npeace and security of that country as well as to the\r\nsubregion. Uganda appeals to all the parties concerned to\r\naccept the mediation efforts of former President Julius\r\nNyerere, which are aimed at achieving a peaceful political\r\nsolution to the conflict through compromise and\r\naccommodation in the context of the Arusha initiative and\r\npeace process.\r\nIn this regard, Uganda urges all the parties\r\nconcerned to resume, as a matter of urgency,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nunconditional political negotiations in order to establish\r\npeace and security for all Burundians. We are committed to\r\nworking closely with other countries in the subregion to\r\nfind a lasting political solution to the problems of Burundi\r\nthrough dialogue and national reconciliation.\r\nThe steps taken by the Government of Rwanda\r\ntowards the restoration of normalcy and achieving national\r\nreconciliation are steps in the right direction. These steps\r\nshould be encouraged and supported, as they provide a\r\nbasis for restoring mutual confidence and trust, which are\r\ncritical for a peaceful return and reintegration of Rwandese\r\nrefugees from neighbouring countries.\r\nWe are concerned about the chaotic situation in\r\nSomalia and call for the reinvigoration of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) peace efforts.\r\nCommon sense must prevail among the warring\r\nfactions in Liberia so that the people of that unhappy\r\ncountry may be given a chance to enjoy peace, security and\r\nnational reconciliation. We welcome the efforts of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States in this\r\nconnection.\r\nWith regard to Angola, we note that the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol is under way. We\r\nencourage both parties to stay the course.\r\nThe efforts of the OAU and the Yamoussoukrou\r\nmediation efforts of President Bédié of Côte d’Ivoire to\r\nseek a peaceful solution to the conflict in Sierra Leone\r\nshould be encouraged.\r\nUganda supports the just struggle of the Sahraoui\r\npeople for self-determination. To this end, we urge the\r\nspeedy resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara, in\r\naccordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\r\nUganda supports the efforts of the United Nations and\r\nthe appropriate regional organizations to diffuse conflicts\r\nthrough preventive diplomacy, as well as through the\r\nmechanisms of peacekeeping and peacemaking, including\r\ndialogue and confidence-building. In this regard, we\r\nreaffirm our support for the OAU Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution, as well as for its\r\nCentral Organ. The Mechanism and the Central Organ\r\nshould be supported and provided with the necessary\r\nresources to enable them to operate effectively.\r\nThe idea of encouraging African Member States to\r\nput in place contingent arrangements for deployment in\r\nsituations requiring peacekeeping or military observer\r\nmissions in Africa has merit and deserves support. At the\r\nsame time, humanitarian programmes with built-in\r\nmechanisms that address the continuum from emergency\r\nrelief to rehabilitation, recovery and long-term\r\ndevelopment are essential to restoring lasting peace.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. However, we urge the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to seize this opportunity to commit\r\nthemselves to adopting concrete time- frames for the total\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons, as well as to stopping\r\nthe qualitative development and refinement of nuclear\r\narsenals, including through computer simulation.\r\nMost African countries have embraced and are\r\nvigorously pursuing far-reaching political and economic\r\nreforms. In Uganda, we have implemented fundamental\r\neconomic reforms consistent with our development\r\npriorities and strategies and the structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes of the Bretton Woods institutions. We have\r\nliberalized trade and created the necessary conditions for\r\nencouraging and promoting both domestic and foreign\r\ndirect investment. We have improved our economic\r\nmanagement systems, with strong emphasis on fiscal and\r\nmonetary discipline. We have endeavoured to integrate\r\nand implement the outcome of the major international\r\nconferences into our national development plans and\r\npriorities.\r\nHowever, in order to nurture these positive\r\ndevelopments and improve the well-being of our citizens,\r\nwe need concerted cooperation and support from the\r\ninternational community by ensuring, among others, a\r\nfavourable external economic environment.\r\nI am glad to state that Uganda is a nation restored\r\nboth politically and economically. Allow me to outline\r\nbriefly the measures that have been taken and which are\r\nresponsible for peace, security and the other positive\r\nchanges that prevail in Uganda today. These positive\r\nchanges are the result of a policy of reconciliation. For\r\nus, reconciliation itself is a means to an end, the end\r\nbeing national unity.\r\nIn pursuance of this objective, we instituted from the\r\nvery beginning the principle of a broad-based Government\r\nwhich accommodated all shades of political opinion and\r\nideologies. The pillar of the democratization process is\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nthe nationwide political participation in decision-making at\r\nall levels, which has empowered people to take charge of\r\ntheir own governance.\r\nUganda remains committed to the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights. A Human Rights Commission\r\nhas been established to oversee the observance of human\r\nrights in Uganda. The Commission is complemented by a\r\nnational human rights unit in the Ministry of Justice and\r\nsimilar units will be established in the near future at the\r\ndistrict level. We have ensured that the promotion of human\r\nrights includes a component to redress the inequality of\r\nopportunities through affirmative action in favour of\r\ndisadvantaged groups such as women, youths and the\r\ndisabled.\r\nIn this regard, the 1995 Constitution of Uganda\r\nprovides for special representation in Parliament for these\r\ngroups. We appreciate the support extended to us so far in\r\nthis area and welcome further technical and financial\r\nsupport, especially towards the review and finalization of\r\nappropriate legislation and the strengthening of relevant\r\nhuman rights entities at various levels.\r\nLast year, a new Constitution was promulgated after\r\nmore than a year of intense debate by a Constituent\r\nAssembly of directly-elected members. On 9 May 1996, the\r\nfirst-ever free and fair presidential elections were held,\r\nfollowed by parliamentary elections on 27 June 1996.\r\nToday, Uganda has its first-ever directly-elected President\r\nsince independence in 1962.\r\nIn Uganda, we share the view that decentralization is\r\na necessary condition for good governance and\r\nempowerment because democracy cannot thrive unless\r\nspace is given for civil society to operate. In pursuance of\r\nthis, political decentralization is not only enshrined in the\r\nConstitution, but is already being implemented. Such a\r\ntransfer of power to the districts and other lower tiers has\r\nremoved the remoteness of government and ensured a\r\nspeedier delivery of goods and services to the people.\r\nYears of war and economic mismanagement have left\r\nUganda with a shattered economy. The present\r\nadministration has continued to make steady progress in\r\nrestoring the economy under the framework of the\r\nEconomic Reform Programme. Inflation has been\r\nsuccessfully controlled since June 1992 at the level of 5.6\r\nper cent, on average. At the same time, Uganda has enjoyed\r\na high average rate of economic growth of 8.1 per cent due\r\nto macroeconomic stability and strict monetary policies.\r\nMs. Bostwick (Bahamas), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIn order to attract investments, an Investment Code\r\nwas instituted to ensure a friendly and conducive\r\ninvestment environment. The Uganda Investment\r\nAuthority was established as a one-stop centre for\r\ninformation.\r\nUganda commends various initiatives taken by the\r\nUnited Nations to eradicate poverty. Special mention\r\nshould be made of the World Social Summit, the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s and the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative for Africa. We commend this spirit of\r\ninternational partnership aimed at addressing persistent\r\npoverty in our region. For its part, the Government of\r\nUganda has embarked on the long road of addressing the\r\nproblem by ensuring that the fruits of economic growth\r\nreach the masses of the population. Among the strategies\r\nin place is an Action Plan for the Eradication of Poverty\r\nwith a Poverty Task Force as its implementing agency. In\r\nthe short and medium terms, the Action Plan focuses on\r\nincreasing household income, primary education and road\r\ninfrastructure. The political and economic achievements\r\nregistered so far prove that a serious, visionary and\r\ncommitted Government can lead donor conditionalities\r\nrather than be led by them.\r\nWe have just concluded the mid-term review of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. For the\r\nsatisfactory outcome of the meeting, we wish to thank\r\nmost profoundly the Government of Japan and all\r\ndelegations which participated actively in this exercise.\r\nOne of the fundamental conclusions of the review is that\r\na lot remains to be done to consolidate the modest\r\npolitical and socio-economic progress that has been\r\nachieved in some parts of the African continent. This will\r\nrequire the mobilization of substantial new and additional\r\nresources and, in particular, the provision of a conducive\r\nexternal economic environment. The review also\r\ndemonstrated that a partnership based on shared\r\nresponsibility and mutuality of interest is possible and\r\ninevitable.\r\nThe United Nations remains a custodian of many\r\ncherished ideals, such as the primacy of democratic\r\ngovernance. The United Nations was born out of a\r\nyearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of\r\naddressing problems brought about by hideous tensions\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nand conflicts throughout the world, with a view to making\r\nplanet Earth a more secure, just and friendly place for\r\npresent and future generations. We all agree on the need to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations so that it can carry out its\r\nglobal mandate effectively. We should therefore provide it\r\nwith adequate resources. This commitment, invariably, calls\r\nupon each Member State to meet its financial obligations to\r\nthe organization in full, on time and without conditions.\r\nWithin the context of strengthening the Organization,\r\nmeasures should be adopted to achieve its democratization\r\nat all levels. Since there is a worldwide trend towards\r\ndemocratization, this Organization cannot remain unaffected\r\nby these winds of change. Uganda therefore supports\r\nproposals to restructure the Security Council in order to\r\nbring transparency to its working methods, democracy to its\r\ndecision-making procedures and equity to reflect the\r\nincreased membership of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations remains, in our view, the\r\nappropriate central forum for addressing global problems\r\nconfronting the international community. It must be\r\nstrengthened, revitalized and democratized. This is the\r\nchallenge that we the peoples of the United Nations must\r\naddress as a matter of priority.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Tourism and Information of Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines, His Excellency The Honourable Alpian\r\nR. O. Allen.\r\nMr. Allen (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): Last\r\nyear, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations with much fanfare and glowing tributes. The organs\r\nof this body were dissected and properly examined and the\r\nfindings were encouraging. The prevailing opinion is that\r\nthe strengths of this institution far outweigh its weaknesses.\r\nHowever, we cannot be complacent. As our Prime Minister,\r\nthe Right Honourable Sir James Mitchell, said when he\r\naddressed the fiftieth session:\r\n“Living institutions, like anything biological, need the\r\nnurture of fresh nutrients, fresh ideas. A living thing\r\neither improves or perishes.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n40th meeting, p. 49)\r\nMr. Razali has assumed the presidency after the period\r\nof stock-taking and at a time when we look with renewed\r\nconfidence towards the United Nations. His passion for\r\ninnovation will serve him well. As he presides over this re-\r\nenergized body, I wish to congratulate him on his election\r\nto the presidency. Let me take this opportunity to extend\r\nto his predecessor our best wishes and deep appreciation\r\nfor the competent manner in which he presided over the\r\nlast historic session.\r\nAs the twenty-first century approaches, we must ask\r\nourselves the following questions: What of the future?\r\nWill our children survive? Will we be at peace with our\r\nfellow men?\r\nThe picture looks bleak. We are still plagued by\r\npersistent poverty, disease, hunger, environmental\r\ndegradation and spiritual pollution, wanton acts of\r\nterrorism, the drug menace, domestic disturbances and\r\nregional conflicts.\r\nThere is still hope so long as we see each other as\r\nfriends and neighbours rather than as competitors. If we\r\npool our resources for the enhancement of mankind, the\r\nworld will be a much better place.\r\nWe have witnessed over the past year a trail of\r\nterrorist destruction and death. In our view, all terrorists\r\nare cowards who rely on fear and destabilization to\r\nachieve their sinister ends. What triumph can there be in\r\nthe murder and disfiguring of innocent people? This is\r\nobviously the product of sick minds. These faceless\r\ncriminals who perform these acts, sometimes with the\r\ntacit approval of authority, have no place in the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nMy delegation is calling for another conference to\r\ndeal with the root causes of terrorism. Such a conference\r\nmust involve this entire body so that the views of small\r\nand mighty nations on the matter can be expressed. As\r\nthe new century approaches, our children must be able to\r\nplay in public parks without having to look over their\r\nshoulders. When we travel, we must be able to view the\r\npassengers next to us as new-found friends rather than\r\npotential executioners.\r\nWhy do we continue to stockpile weapons of mass\r\ndestruction? The aim of these weapons is to kill. Killing\r\nhuman beings should not be regarded as a sport. Life will\r\nalways be man’s most treasured possession. In our\r\npeaceful region, we are strangers to the world of such\r\ndeadly arsenals and will continue to denounce their use.\r\nWe are delighted to be associated with the passage of the\r\nAustralian resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty. Any step, however small, towards the curbing\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nof the arms race and the eventual elimination of weapons\r\nmust be viewed as positive.\r\nOne of the most formidable challenges of our time is\r\nthe protection of the environment. The threats which\r\nconfront us are daunting; global warming, desertification\r\nand deforestation are among the many. Environmental\r\nprotection is the key to our survival. Mankind is faced with\r\na choice: either save the environment or perish.\r\nThe suffering in Burundi, Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda\r\nand Bosnia cannot go unnoticed. The international\r\ncommunity can do much more to help the dispossessed and\r\nthe hungry of these troubled lands. After all, should we not\r\nbe our brother’s keeper?\r\nI come from a small but proud country. Our people\r\nbelieve in industry and hard work. The banana industry is\r\nthe mainstay of our economy. But our very existence is\r\nunder serious threat from forces larger and more powerful\r\nthan ourselves. I speak not in anger, only in pain and\r\nhelplessness. How else can we feel when those who have\r\nthe capacity to help us seek our destruction? If the forces\r\nof indifference and greed were to succeed, our society\r\nwould be thrown out of gear and the democracy which we\r\nso cherish will go up in flames.\r\nOur entire population has been sensitized to our\r\nbanana woes and the people have vented their frustration by\r\nwriting thousands of letters to those who may hold the key\r\nto our survival. We wish to thank all those who have come\r\nto our assistance, be they in Europe or elsewhere, and we\r\nsincerely hope that they will continue to lend a helping\r\nhand.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is deeply concerned\r\nabout the use of illegal drugs and drug trafficking. The\r\nmagnitude of this problem transcends national boundaries\r\nand calls for increased cooperation on a multilateral level.\r\nThe influence of the drug barons runs very deep.\r\nSometimes they take on the characteristics of power elites.\r\nWe firmly believe that renewed international efforts can go\r\na long way towards the eradication of this menace, which\r\ncontaminates both body and mind.\r\nWhile we welcome the recent elections in Bosnia, we\r\nare troubled by developments in the Persian Gulf. We\r\nsincerely hope that the situation will normalize itself as\r\nsoon as possible, since an escalation of the crisis would be\r\nof benefit to no one.\r\nThe Middle East is another area of concern. We\r\nhope that the recent peace talks between the Israelis and\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization will bear fruit.\r\nMuch has been achieved over the past two decades and it\r\nis expected that the next century will bring peace to the\r\ntroubled people of these ancient lands.\r\nI now turn my attention to the vexing question of the\r\nresumed participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nin the United Nations. This founding member of the\r\nUnited Nations has been excluded from this body for a\r\nquarter of a century. How does one reconcile this with the\r\nprinciples of parallel representation of States and of\r\nuniversality? It is time for the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan to be readmitted to this body. In our view, the\r\ncountry not only possesses the attributes of nationhood,\r\nbut it is well endowed to contribute to the development of\r\nMember States of this body. Its economic success is a\r\nmodel for developing countries. The country has also\r\nmade democratic strides. I wish through this forum to\r\ncongratulate the Republic of China on Taiwan on the\r\nholding of its first direct presidential election. It is really\r\na triumph of the democratic process. All States have not\r\nembraced this process.\r\nDespite the adoption and entry into force of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, we are shocked by\r\nthe incidence of gross violations of the fundamental rights\r\nof the child. Sexual abuse, prostitution and child labour\r\nare but a few of the problems that dehumanize our\r\nchildren. My delegation joins in the call for measures to\r\nbe taken, not only for the universal ratification of the\r\nConvention, but also for the effective implementation of\r\nthis instrument.\r\nThere has been much discussion about the reform of\r\nthe Security Council. Brilliant ideas have been put\r\nforward from all quarters. Our own view is that the\r\nSecurity Council must be restructured to reflect an\r\nequitable geographic distribution. After all, big Powers do\r\nnot have a monopoly on knowledge or truth. And in this\r\nbody, all nations should be treated as equals.\r\nHistory has saddled the United Nations with a heavy\r\nburden of responsibility and, as we look towards the\r\ntwenty-first century, we must seize every opportunity to\r\nachieve the goals and ideals enshrined in the Charter.\r\nThere is a great deal to be done in the area of social and\r\neconomic development, but we can do it once we have\r\nthe political will and the unity of purpose.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nWorks, Communication and Information of the Gambia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ebrima Ceesay.\r\nMr. Ceesay (Gambia): I should like first of all to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail wholeheartedly on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of this session. His close\r\nassociation with the United Nations during these years as\r\nhis country’s representative makes him not only highly\r\nqualified for the office but also fully cognizant of the\r\nactivities, including the needs and challenges, of this, our\r\ngreat Organization. I would assure him of my delegation’s\r\nsupport at all times.\r\nIn the same vein, I should like to extend appreciation\r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who\r\nworked tirelessly to ensure that the work of the Assembly\r\nwas both effective and successful. My delegation’s thanks\r\nand gratitude also go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the successful holding of this session in\r\nthe face of serious financial and other constraints, and for\r\nthe selfless service he is rendering to our Organization. The\r\nquality of his work, as well as his untiring efforts to\r\nrevitalize our 50-year-old Organization, deserve our full and\r\ncollective support and encouragement. The Gambia remains\r\ncommitted to the Organization of African Unity’s (OAU)\r\ndeclaration of support for His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali to continue in office as Secretary-General for\r\na second term.\r\nLast year, when the delegation of the Gambia\r\naddressed the Assembly, we dwelt at length on the twin\r\ndemocratization and development processes in the Gambia.\r\nIt is fitting today to report on the progress made so far and\r\nthe successes achieved. Concerning the democratization\r\nprocess, I am pleased to inform this gathering that we\r\nsuccessfully conducted a referendum on 8 August 1996 to\r\nadopt a new Constitution, and we elected a new President\r\non 26 September 1996. These two activities have been\r\ncharacterized by a high sense of political maturity and civic\r\ninterest and a high level of voter turnout.\r\nThe Constitution was adopted by a vote of 270,093 in\r\nfavour against 113,744 opposed, with a total turnout of 86.9\r\nper cent for the referendum. Not only is this new\r\nConstitution the best we have ever had, but it also embraces\r\nthe people’s political expectations for the advent of a true\r\nsense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of\r\nfreedom, respect for human rights, and a strong nationalistic\r\nfeeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of\r\nthe world on a free and equitable basis. Furthermore, the\r\nnew Constitution ensures that the Second Republic will\r\nprogress and flourish under the universally respected\r\nprinciples of transparency, accountability and probity —\r\na sine qua non for any honest and well-meaning\r\nGovernment. The presidential election, the penultimate\r\nphase of our two-year transitional programme, was held\r\non 26 September 1996. Four political parties presented\r\ncandidates, and His Excellency Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh,\r\nleader of the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and\r\nConstruction (APRC), emerged as the winner. The\r\nPresident-elect polled 220,011 votes, or about 56 per cent\r\nof the total votes cast. This resounding victory indicates\r\na strong endorsement by the Gambian people of the\r\npolicies of the now-dissolved Armed Forces Provisional\r\nRuling Council (AFPRC). The distribution of the results\r\nand the actual percentages of the votes captured by the\r\nrespective candidates depict an election that was free and\r\nfair — free from the obvious abuses of the position of\r\nincumbency.\r\nIn keeping with the APRC’s philosophy of national\r\nunity, the President-elect has extended a message of peace\r\nand reconciliation to all Gambians. In his address to the\r\nnation on 27 September 1996, following the presidential\r\nelection, he said:\r\n“In democratic elections no voters lose, since the\r\noutcome is the collective will of all.”\r\nHe invited all Gambians, irrespective of political\r\nconviction or affiliation, to come together and work for\r\nthe development of the country. In concluding the\r\ndemocratization process, the Gambia will hold its\r\nNational Assembly elections on 11 December 1996. Both\r\nthe Government and the Provisional Independent Electoral\r\nCommission attach a great deal of importance to these\r\nelections and have therefore been encouraging interested\r\nparties and individuals to contest for seats in the National\r\nAssembly. We have no doubt that the peace and\r\norderliness that characterized the referendum and\r\npresidential election will prevail in the forthcoming\r\nelections.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the electoral process in the\r\nGambia has been complemented by the Government’s\r\npriority development projects. During the last two years,\r\nthe Government demonstrated to the whole world that an\r\nimportant ingredient of national development is the\r\ncommitment and honesty of a Government in\r\nimplementing realistic programmes for the benefit of its\r\npeople. In the education sector, several primary, junior\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nand secondary schools were built and a university extension\r\nprogramme launched. In the area of communication, the\r\ncountry’s first-ever television station was commissioned,\r\nand the international airport was expanded and modernized.\r\nGenerally, there has been significant improvement and\r\nexpansion of the country’s road network to ease the chronic\r\ntransportation problems. In the health sector, the\r\nGovernment has built a third referral hospital, and more\r\ndoctors and nurses have been recruited from inside and\r\noutside the country. As regards the agricultural sector,\r\nmechanization has received greater attention as a step\r\ntowards achieving food self-sufficiency. In short, more has\r\nbeen achieved in all sectors of the economy during the two\r\nyears of AFPRC rule than during the 30 years of the\r\nprevious regime.\r\nThe resilience of the Gambian economy during the last\r\ntwo years — in spite of the unjustified sanctions imposed\r\non the Gambia by our development partners for purely\r\npolitical reasons, and in the face of other powerful external\r\nshocks deriving mainly from trends in the global economy\r\nand in world trade — has been reassuring. The\r\nGovernment’s macroeconomic policies and development\r\nefforts have helped to create an enabling environment for\r\nprivate investment, including foreign direct investment. In\r\neffect, the country’s economic and financial performance\r\nduring the 1995-96 year showed real gross domestic\r\nproduct growing by 3 per cent. The projections for 1996-97\r\nare for it to grow by 3.5 per cent, with inflation limited to\r\n5 per cent.\r\nAs we forge ahead, we in the Gambia are proud of our\r\nGovernment and its laudable achievements since it took\r\nover the reins of power on 22 July 1994. We have learned\r\nthe true meaning of democracy: an amicable partnership\r\nbetween people and Government. It is through such a\r\npartnership that the Civic Education Programme was\r\nsuccessful and that Vision 2020 — a national strategy for\r\nsocio-economic development, aimed at raising the standard\r\nof living of the Gambian population — was launched.\r\nI should like at this stage to express the sincere\r\ngratitude of the Government and people of the Gambia for\r\nthe support and assistance received from some members of\r\nthe international community during the critical period of the\r\ntransition programme. We fervently hope that this support\r\nfrom our friends and well-wishers will continue to enable\r\nus successfully to conduct the National Assembly Elections\r\non 11 December 1996. With the successful end of the two-\r\nyear transition programme and the peaceful return of our\r\ncountry to democratic civilian rule, we also expect that the\r\ninternational community will now join us in our pursuit\r\nto achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe recently concluded United Nations Conference\r\non Human Settlements (Habitat II) in Istanbul will go\r\ndown in history as one of the most successful\r\ninternational conferences organized by the United Nations.\r\nThe Habitat Agenda, adopted by the Conference, reflects\r\ngenerally the acute shortage of shelter and the growing\r\ninternational concern for more and better shelter.\r\nAdequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlement\r\ndevelopment in an urbanizing world remain basic human\r\nneeds and a universal concern. In fact, the statement by\r\nthe Secretary-General of Habitat II, Mr. Wally N’Dow,\r\nthat\r\n“Istanbul will be the gateway to development into\r\nthe next century”,\r\nwill hold true well into the twenty-first century. The\r\ncommitment of the Government of the Gambia to the\r\nimplementation of the Habitat Agenda — including the\r\nGlobal Plan of Action and, in particular, the forging of\r\nsustainable partnerships with all actors in the field of\r\nhuman settlements — remains high.\r\nThe mid-term review of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s in\r\nSeptember 1996 provided an opportunity to review\r\nprogress in Africa’s development. The review reaffirmed\r\nthe New Agenda as a fundamental and achievable\r\nprogramme for the socio-economic development of\r\nAfrica, if both Africa and its development partners adhere\r\nto the programme’s stated responsibilities and\r\ncommitments. The review revealed the gradual but\r\nencouraging growth of the African economy, with an\r\nincreased gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.3 per cent\r\nin 1995, as compared to 2.1 per cent in 1994. The\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda, however, continues\r\nto be constrained by failure to achieve the United Nations\r\ntarget of devoting 0.7 per cent of the GDP of developed\r\ncountries, including 0.15 per cent of their GNP, for\r\noverseas development assistance to the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nAfrica’s huge external debt burden, which grew at an\r\naverage annual rate of 1.5 per cent between 1990 and\r\n1995, remains the single most serious constraint to\r\nAfrica’s consistent economic recovery and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Major donors, creditors and the international\r\ncommunity should collectively devise a multilateral debt-\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nrelief programme aimed at completely writing off the debt\r\nof developing countries by the turn of the century. The\r\nimplementation of the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative for Africa alongside the New Agenda, and in\r\ncollaboration with the Bretton Woods institutions and other\r\nagencies, will constitute a new and dynamic global\r\napproach of working with Africa to accelerate its\r\ndevelopment. The attainment of the objectives of the\r\nSpecial Initiative within a decade will depend to a large\r\nextent on the availability of new and additional funds,\r\nrather than on the reprioritizing of programmes and\r\nremarshalling of funds identified under the New Agenda.\r\nOnly in this way can the international community realize —\r\nas the President of the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn, said\r\nin connection with the launching of the Special Initiative —\r\nthat\r\n“there is a need for us to give the push, that help, the\r\nassistance which can keep the momentum”.\r\nGlobalization continues to hold much attraction, but its\r\nbenefits continue to elude the majority of developing\r\ncountries. The impact of globalization and liberalization on\r\nemployment and sustainable socio-economic development\r\nin general has been negative. The recent Ninth Meeting of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) in South Africa, while reaffirming the\r\ninternational community’s commitment to partnership for\r\ndevelopment, recognized the disparities among nations as\r\nwell as the need to help developing countries reap the\r\nbenefits of globalization and development and to ensure\r\ntheir full and effective participation in the world economy\r\non an equitable basis.\r\nThe case of the least developed countries has always\r\nreceived the attention and support of the international\r\ncommunity, particularly through the adoption of the Paris\r\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s. The mid-term global\r\nreview of this Programme of Action, held in September\r\n1995, failed to confirm the realization of the programme’s\r\nprimary objective, which is to arrest and reverse the\r\ndeterioration in the socio-economic situation in the least\r\ndeveloped countries and to revitalize their growth and\r\ndevelopment. It is noted that the lack of progress in\r\nimproving the socio-economic performance of LDCs is\r\nattributable, in the main, to the failure of the international\r\ncommunity to provide the necessary support and assistance\r\nthrough official development assistance, debt relief and\r\nbenefits from globalization and liberalization. The success\r\nof the Programme of Action during the second half of its\r\nexistence will depend to a large measure on the amount\r\nof international support for the economic growth of least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nThe attainment of international peace and security\r\nremains a vital aspect of our Organization’s work. It is\r\nfor these reasons that my delegation joins the international\r\ncommunity in supporting the United Nations effort to\r\nensure peace and the resolution of conflicts throughout\r\nthe world. In this regard, the set-back in the peace process\r\nevidenced by the upheaval of April 1996 in Liberia was\r\nof great concern to the international community.\r\nHowever, thanks to the ceaseless efforts of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS),\r\nespecially through its Committee of Nine on Liberia, the\r\npeace process is back on track, and so far there has been\r\nsatisfactory progress on its implementation. In spite of the\r\ndifficulties encountered over the past few years in the\r\nimplementation of the Abuja Agreement, it is still our\r\nfirm belief that the Agreement remains the best\r\nframework for restoring durable peace to Liberia. With\r\nthe genuine commitment and goodwill of all parties and\r\nthe continued support of the international community,\r\nespecially the United Nations, I am confident that a\r\nlasting solution will soon be found.\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina gives some\r\nhope that the brokered peace will continue to hold. The\r\nelections of 14 September 1996 and the new federal\r\nGovernment which has been created should hopefully lead\r\nto national unity and reconciliation.\r\nIt is sad to note that the civil war in Somalia, after\r\nsimmering down for some time, has suddenly flared up\r\nagain. The renewed fighting has put a great deal of strain\r\non the peace process. The efforts of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and of the international community in\r\ngeneral to contain hostilities and restore peace, security\r\nand stability continue to receive our fullest support.\r\nThe dramatic deterioration of the situation in\r\nBurundi is a major source of concern for all peace-loving\r\npeople the world over. We are indeed saddened by the\r\nspate of ethnic killings in this country, which continue to\r\nclaim many innocent lives. It is our collective\r\nresponsibility to put an end to this sorry state of affairs\r\nand thus avert a replay of the tragic events that occurred\r\nin neighbouring Rwanda some two years ago. In this\r\nregard, we continue closely to monitor the evolution of\r\nthe political situation in Burundi and hope that peace,\r\nsecurity and order will be permanently restored. We\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\ntherefore strongly support the OAU peace initiatives, in\r\nparticular the Mwanza peace process and the Arusha peace\r\ninitiative, aimed at guaranteeing security and democracy for\r\nall people in Burundi.\r\nThe peace dividend so far achieved in our search for\r\na lasting peace in the Middle East should not be allowed to\r\nfade away. Rather, we should continue to pursue the peace\r\nprocess in order to achieve a lasting peace in the region on\r\nthe basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe quest for peace is a universal concern of the\r\ninternational community. At the same time, the desire for\r\nequality and recognition continues to elude some nations.\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan’s quest for recognition\r\nand readmission into the United Nations has failed to have\r\nthe necessary impact on the attitude and goodwill of the\r\ninternational community. Today, the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan stands very high in the international arena in the\r\nfield of economic growth and social development. It is\r\nnoted not only for its economic achievements, but also for\r\nits exemplary political reform. The direct election of its\r\nPresident on 23 March 1996, an event unprecedented in\r\nChinese history, marked the culmination of Taiwan’s\r\npolitical democratization. This accomplishment ought to be\r\nrecognized by the United Nations, in accordance also with\r\nthe principle of universality. My country believes that the\r\nprecedent of parallel United Nations membership, which\r\napplied to the former East Germany and West Germany and\r\ncurrently applies to North Korea and South Korea, should\r\nbe applied in the case of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nBesides the membership factor, which is in accordance\r\nwith Article 4 of the United Nations Charter, there is a\r\njustice factor relating to Articles 1 and 2 of the same\r\nCharter. It is regrettable that this factor was not included in\r\nour debate when the matter was considered at the meeting\r\nof the General Committee of the General Assembly, held\r\non 18 September 1996, in connection with the item on the\r\ndraft agenda entitled “Consideration of the exceptional\r\nsituation of the inability, resulting from General Assembly\r\nresolution 2758 (XXVI), of the 21.3 million people on\r\nTaiwan, Republic of China, to participate in the activities\r\nof the United Nations”. As we all know, one can quantify\r\nnumbers of signatures, but not emotions — that is,\r\nsympathy with and an interest and belief in the justification\r\nand rightness of the case of Taiwan. It is our conviction\r\nthat the parallel participation of the two sides of the Taiwan\r\nstrait in the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations would be conducive to the maintenance of\r\npeace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and in the\r\nworld in general. Let us therefore give the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan the opportunity to share with us their\r\ncapabilities and experience in a collective effort to realize\r\nhumankind’s hope for the equitable development of every\r\nregion of the world.\r\nThe practice of the unilateral imposition of an\r\neconomic embargo against one Member State by another\r\nMember State should have ceased with the end of the\r\ncold-war era. For more than three decades now, Cuba has\r\nstruggled, against all odds, to survive economically and\r\nfinancially. With patience and determination, Cuba has\r\ncontinued to make great strides towards socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. Indeed, among the family of nations, it has\r\nexcelled in some activities of common benefit to\r\nhumankind, such as genetic engineering and modern\r\nmedicine. These laudable achievements and progress\r\nmade by Cuba deserve to be encouraged.\r\nThe application of the principles of international law\r\nand the effort of the international community to propagate\r\npeace and security should be all-embracing. In this\r\nconnection, as regards Libya’s alleged complicity in the\r\ndowning over Lockerbie, Scotland, of Pan Am flight 103,\r\nwe support the OAU resolution adopted by the sixty-\r\nfourth session of the Council of Ministers in Yaoundé\r\nfrom 1 to 5 July 1996, as a basis for overcoming the\r\npresent impasse on the issue.\r\nConcerning the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, we\r\nwould like to urge the international community not to\r\nrelent in its efforts to find a just and peaceful settlement\r\nto the dispute in accordance with the relevant resolutions\r\nof the Security Council. The Gambia reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the international community’s resolve to\r\ncombat naked aggression, particularly between States, and\r\ninternational terrorism from whatever quarter. Pursuant to\r\nthe relevant Security Council and Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) resolutions, we support the\r\nefforts of Kuwait to preserve and defend its territorial\r\nintegrity while seeking a just and speedy redress to the\r\nconsequences of the Iraqi invasion.\r\nLast year we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations. The occasion afforded us the\r\nopportunity to review the operations and mandate of the\r\nOrganization. The ongoing exercise of strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations system is complementing this review and\r\nthe rededication to the ideals of the United Nations. In\r\nparticular, we should give our full support to the\r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly and\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, and to the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council — including the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation of all geographical regions on this important\r\norgan of the United Nations. The proposals for the reform\r\nof the Security Council made by the African Group and\r\nItaly, among others, should also be given due consideration.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should ensure that the\r\nhegemonistic interests of a few will not be promoted to the\r\ndetriment of the majority.\r\nThe reforms of the United Nations put in sharp focus\r\nthe present financial crisis of the Organization and the\r\ngallant efforts of the Secretary-General to improve its\r\nfinancial situation. The serious consideration the General\r\nAssembly has given this matter since 1994, leading to its\r\nsetting up a High-level Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nFinancial Situation of the United Nations, once more\r\ndemonstrates Member States’ commitment to the\r\npreservation and continued operations of the Organization.\r\nThe cumulative effect of the financial reforms, including\r\nthe huge staff reductions, should, as much as possible,\r\nneither compromise the efficiency and productivity of the\r\nOrganization nor deflect it from its traditional operations\r\nand renewed mandate. The Organization’s precarious\r\nfinancial situation is our collective concern, and we should\r\ntherefore resolutely strive to ensure that it is promptly\r\naddressed. This of course requires that all Member States\r\nhave the clear political will to pay their contributions\r\npunctually. Member countries should desist from\r\nwithholding their contributions for purely political\r\nconsiderations, as this would paralyse the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is fitting at this juncture to refer to the work of this\r\nbody in pursuing the objectives of the Agenda for Peace\r\nand the Agenda for Development. The search for a common\r\nbasis for international cooperation on conflict resolution,\r\nrelief operations and development remains an active agenda\r\nof the United Nations. The success of any international\r\ncooperation on these issues would require greater focus on\r\nthe effective implementation of the development priorities\r\nof developing countries. The link between peace and\r\ndevelopment is not only essential but forms part of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The two serve as twin pillars of the\r\ninternational community’s effort to achieve universal peace\r\nand security based on the promotion of the social and\r\neconomic development of all peoples. We remain fully\r\ncommitted to their effective realization.\r\nThe manifold problems of illicit drug trafficking and\r\nabuse are becoming increasingly universal. In many\r\nrespects, both producer and non-producer nations are\r\nrapidly falling victim to the pernicious effects of illicit\r\ndrugs. Today countries that once were drug free are either\r\ngradually becoming infested with the sale and use of\r\nillicit drugs or are being made transit posts in the illicit\r\ntrafficking of narcotics and psychotropic substances. For\r\nmany years now, the United Nations has led a steady, all-\r\nembracing fight against the global drug menace,\r\nespecially through its International Drug Control\r\nProgramme and Global Programme of Action, and,\r\nrecently, by making drugs the subject of the 1996 high-\r\nlevel segment of the Economic and Social Council\r\nsession. The effort of the United Nations in combating the\r\ntrafficking and sale of illicit drugs cannot succeed unless\r\nthe international community lends it its full support\r\nthrough improved and effective international cooperation\r\nin drug control. The Gambia will continue to participate\r\nin any international effort to combat and defuse the global\r\ndrug menace. At the national level, appropriate organs\r\nand control measures have been put in place to discourage\r\nthe use of the Gambia as a transit post in the illicit global\r\ndrug trade and to save Gambians from falling victim to its\r\nharmful effects.\r\nIn the area of nuclear disarmament, it is gratifying\r\nto note that the General Assembly recently adopted the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. That\r\nendorsement by the international community should not,\r\nhowever, overlook the legitimate concerns and\r\nreservations expressed by India.\r\nThe convening of the World Food Summit next\r\nmonth in Rome to address hunger and food security\r\nprovides the opportunity to renew the international\r\ncommunity’s commitment to the eradication of hunger\r\nand malnutrition and the attainment of food security for\r\nall.\r\nThe linkage between the problem of food security\r\nand poverty cannot be overemphasized. The Gambia,\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and in observance of the International Year\r\nfor the Eradication of Poverty (1996), has been\r\nparticipating effectively in the fight against poverty.\r\nNational programmes have been designed and put in place\r\nto achieve poverty eradication.\r\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has\r\nwitnessed some landmark activities in international\r\ncooperation. The series of United Nations global\r\nconferences signifies the international community’s\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\npreoccupation with the preservation of international peace\r\nand security, the promotion and preservation of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, the propagation of\r\ndevelopment techniques and the attainment of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the provision of adequate shelter for our\r\nrapidly growing population and, indeed, the attempt to\r\nensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all\r\nover the world.\r\nThe Gambia is proud to be associated with this\r\ninternational crusade for a secure and better life for every\r\nhuman being.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nChairman of the delegation of Antigua and Barbuda, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): It is with profound\r\npleasure that I salute the President, a diplomat of\r\nexperience and stature and one worthy to preside over the\r\nfunctions of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish to recall that it was his country and mine that\r\nbrought the question of Antarctica to the United Nations,\r\nand our countries have worked closely together for a\r\nnumber of years. We have made progress as countries from\r\nvarious parts of the world have joined us in an effort to\r\npreserve Antarctica as the last natural heritage of mankind.\r\nHis country’s efforts in regard to the betterment of the\r\nglobal community are deeply admired by my countrymen,\r\nand it is with a sense of genuine cordiality that we refer to\r\nMalaysia as a friendly and brotherly country. Permit me\r\nalso to extend sincere thanks to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, who so ably led\r\nthe historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nOn 7 July of this year Hurricane Bertha passed\r\nperilously close to Antigua and Barbuda, and our twin-\r\nisland State sustained some damage. Small island\r\ndeveloping States like ours are subject to various natural\r\ndisasters — earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes.\r\nIn 1974, we experienced an earthquake that measured 7.8\r\non the Richter scale and caused considerable destruction. A\r\nvolcano on the island of Montserrat, some 50 kilometres\r\nfrom our shores, has been active for the past 15 months.\r\nOur people live in constant fear of fall-out and tidal waves\r\nfrom a major eruption.\r\nThe natural phenomenon presently plaguing Montserrat\r\ncould be a prelude to a disaster that can destroy small\r\nislands globally. Evidence of the warming of the planet has\r\nclearly emerged, and extreme weather events have become\r\nmore frequent and intense. Last year, Hurricane Luis\r\nunleashed its fury on our country for 48 hours and was\r\ndeclared to have been the worst storm of the century.\r\nHurricane Marilyn followed in its wake, intensifying the\r\ndamage. Indeed, we remain grateful to the countries and\r\ninstitutions that provided various forms of assistance to\r\nhelp in the reconstruction.\r\nIn addressing the General Assembly of the\r\nOrganization of American States this year, our envoy\r\nnoted that development is not sustainable if a score of\r\nstorms and hurricanes are to trample through our region\r\neach year. Carbon dioxide emissions caused by the\r\nburning of petroleum, coal, wood and gas since the start\r\nof the Industrial Revolution in western Europe 200 years\r\nago have begun to place the survival of small islands in\r\njeopardy. Harmful production, wasteful consumption and\r\ndangerous disposal patterns continue to characterize the\r\nbehaviour of the largest industrialized States. We must\r\ntherefore reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the agreed\r\nToronto targets. Together, let us address the challenge so\r\nthat we may bequeath to future generations a better and\r\na safer world than we inherited. Our demise will only\r\nsignal the beginning of the end of a marvellous\r\ncivilization, more creative and more inventive than any\r\nthat has gone before.\r\nBetween 1 and 15 July Antigua and Barbuda played\r\nits part at the human settlement Conference, Habitat II, at\r\nIstanbul, and we urge that the Istanbul Declaration and\r\nPlan of Action be adhered to. It must be recognized that\r\nit is in the cities and towns of the new urban world,\r\nwhere most of us will ultimately live and work, that most\r\neconomic activity will take place and goods be produced.\r\nIt is where most pollution will be generated and national\r\nresources consumed, with an impact felt far beyond city\r\nlimits. Moreover, it will be in the cities and towns of this\r\nurban world that growing social tensions and conflict,\r\nrooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources,\r\nwill be resolved, and where the key to true human\r\nsecurity will be found.\r\nThe problems of urbanization are not limited to the\r\nmore endowed countries. We too, despite our small size,\r\nhave to cope with the varying patterns and outcomes that\r\ndemand responses that have at times threatened to\r\noverwhelm us. Nevertheless, I am happy to report that in\r\nAntigua and Barbuda we have made considerable progress\r\ntowards control and adequate regulation.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nUnder the guidance of the Development Control\r\nAuthority and the Central Housing and Planning Authority\r\nmajor initiatives have been undertaken, with assistance from\r\nthe United Nations Centre for Human Settlements and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme. The Government,\r\nin partnership with other sectors of society, is playing a\r\nmultiple role in improving living and working conditions on\r\nan equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy\r\nadequate shelter, affordable basic services and sustainable\r\nhuman settlements.\r\nThe Government of Antigua and Barbuda not only\r\nperforms the functions of a national policy-maker and\r\nhousing administrator, but also serves in the capacity of\r\nlender and developer. In those roles, it has ensured that\r\ninterest rates are kept at reasonable levels and that\r\nrepayment periods for loans are as long as 20 years. In its\r\nregulatory role, the Government of the Labour Party has put\r\nforward development standards, stipulated building\r\nprocedures and integrated land and shelter policies with\r\nprogrammes for reducing poverty and assuring employment,\r\nfor environmental protection, for improvement in education\r\nand health, and for providing clean water and sanitation\r\nfacilities.\r\nThis is indeed a strange and puzzling world. With\r\nreference to sustainable development, a myth has gathered\r\nmomentum that maintains that the developing world is\r\nmaking significant forward strides. World Bank data,\r\nhowever, demonstrate that over 60 per cent of the countries\r\nin which the United Nations and other bodies have\r\ndevelopment assistance operations have witnessed declines\r\nin real per capita income over the decade ending in 1994.\r\nJames Gustave Speth, the Special Coordinator for\r\nEconomic and Social Development, in a forceful and\r\nmoving presentation at the opening of the 1996 substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council, noted two\r\nmajor ironies of the current situation. He declared that now\r\nthat the world is freed from distorting effects on\r\ndevelopment cooperation, just when the development\r\nassistance community has learned so much more about how\r\nto succeed and do its job well, just when the needs of the\r\ndeveloping world are growing rapidly and dramatically —\r\njust at this precise time, the resources that are needed for\r\ndevelopment cooperation are shrinking rapidly and\r\ndramatically. In the past four years, real development\r\nassistance has declined by 20 to 25 per cent.\r\nThe other irony is that just when there is a better\r\nunderstanding of the essential links between peace and\r\ndevelopment cooperation, just when the United Nations is\r\ncalled upon to assume much greater responsibilities in the\r\nfollow-up to conferences and in post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding and other areas, just when the United Nations is\r\nreforming and strengthening itself to do these things, the\r\nOrganization finds itself threatened by a financial crisis\r\nthat afflicts both its assessed and its voluntary\r\ncontributions. Indeed, Speth sees the above as not only\r\nironies, but as tragedies of our era.\r\nThis, the major international Organization, is\r\nrestructuring itself and endeavouring to undertake\r\nmeaningful reform. While it may be true that the existing\r\nfinancial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment, there is\r\nno denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being\r\ngenerated here, whether in regard to the duplication of\r\nwork detail, the excessive copying of documents, the\r\nscheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish\r\nnothing or to a myriad of other undesirables. Financial\r\nconcerns are not, however, the only issue of which the\r\nworld body is seized. Reform is being undertaken in a\r\nmulti-pronged manner, which in itself will be a long\r\nprocess that can be justified in a Benthamite way by\r\nemphasizing the greatest good for the greatest number.\r\nAt present, even though the discussions have been\r\nconsidered to have made progress, there is not even the\r\nglimmer of a discernible outcome in regard to the\r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”. Although consensus exists on expanding the\r\nCouncil, the manner in which that can be achieved\r\nequitably remains to be resolved. Antigua and Barbuda is\r\nfirm in its declared position that any expansion should\r\ninclude developing countries and that both the African\r\nand the Latin American and Caribbean Groups should be\r\nrepresented. Similarly, Antigua and Barbuda would like\r\nto see certain restrictions placed on the use of the veto.\r\nWe understand that all efforts at restructuring and reform\r\nin the United Nations, however, should be focused on\r\neconomic growth and development.\r\nIn this whole process of misunderstandings, the\r\nregional commissions are being placed under attack\r\nthrough cut-backs and in some instances calls for their\r\ndissolution. This is particularly hard on those of us who\r\nare being served by the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC). We see ECLAC as\r\na regional organization that has already reformed itself\r\nand should not be penalized by calls for further reforms.\r\nECLAC has rendered valuable service through\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nsubprogrammes on economic development, social\r\ndevelopment, international trade, development financing and\r\ntransport, industrial, agricultural, and technological\r\nmodernization, environment, natural resources and human\r\nsettlements, statistics and economic projections, the\r\nintegration of women into development, regional integration\r\nand cooperation, economic and social planning and\r\npopulation. In all of these fields, ECLAC collaborates with\r\nthe Governments of the Americas in the investigation and\r\nanalysis of public policy, provides technical assistance and\r\ntraining, and promotes regional cooperation.\r\nFor those of us in the Caribbean it is imperative that\r\nECLAC be fully sustained to continue to assist us in these\r\nand other areas. This is set against the backdrop of the\r\npressures that are being brought to bear on the Caribbean\r\nregion, which Prime Minister Lester Bird described at the\r\nmeeting of Heads of Government of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) on 6 July. He spoke of the right-\r\nwing voices that are ready to impose upon the States of the\r\nCaribbean Community a new colonialism under a variety of\r\nguises, such as those of limited sovereignty and\r\nextraterritoriality. Indeed, the very economic survival of\r\nsome Caribbean States is threatened as a result of pressures\r\nbrought against countries whose sustenance depends almost\r\nentirely upon the production of a yellow fruit.\r\nMost of the countries affected by the banana dispute\r\nare former European colonies, and the continuation of their\r\nhistoric access to European markets is crucial to their\r\neconomic survival. Without some form of protection, the\r\nbanana industry in the CARICOM States would collapse,\r\nleading to severe social dislocation that would ultimately\r\nmanifest itself in political catastrophe.\r\nRecognizing the significance of banana production to\r\nsome of our economies, the European Union has a\r\nprogramme in which a small portion of its market is\r\nreserved for Caribbean producers, a portion that is less than\r\n10 per cent. This has certainly not been a major problem\r\nfor the big companies, for a handful of multinational\r\nconcerns still controls 60 per cent of the European market\r\nand 70 per cent of the overall market. However, it appears\r\nthat Bob Herbert, in an editorial of 13 May, was correct\r\nwhen he asserted:\r\n“for the multinationals, enough is never enough”. (The\r\nNew York Times, 13 May 1996, Section A, p. 15)\r\nIndeed, for countries where literacy rates are in the\r\nninetieth percentile and where political prisoners are\r\nunheard of, it would be disastrous if the economies of\r\ntheir societies were to be destroyed through the\r\ndestruction of the banana industry.\r\nThe bleakness of the aforementioned situation is,\r\nhowever, offset by the ideas expressed at the Tokyo\r\nConference on Development Strategy in March of this\r\nyear, where it was posited that there is the will to sustain\r\na new global partnership and make it effective. There was\r\nconsensus that the issues that stretched beyond\r\nmathematical economics, that is, issues such as those\r\nincorporating poverty, the environment, the advancement\r\nof women and food security, had to be tackled at both the\r\nnational and international levels.\r\nIt was nonetheless brought out that many developed\r\ncountries are experiencing harsh financial difficulties that\r\nare imposing severe limits on their capacity to contribute\r\nto the international organizations. Thus, the nations of the\r\nworld had first to respond to the challenge of poverty by\r\nstriving for its eradication. Secondly, the key to success\r\nclearly lies in nations working together to build and\r\nimplement a development strategy to meet the challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century. Thirdly, in the process of\r\nworking out and implementing a new development\r\nstrategy, it is crucially important to reinvigorate the roles\r\nof the international organizations, and in particular that of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nOf significant concern to developing countries was\r\nthe statement that in efforts to secure sufficient resources\r\nit is important to take steps in other policy areas such as\r\ntrade or technological transfer. In addition, the\r\nglobalization of the world economy makes it important to\r\npromote the development of human resources and the\r\ncapacity for institution-building in developing countries.\r\nIn its Human Development Report 1996, the United\r\nNations Development Programme acknowledged that,\r\nalthough some countries are experiencing unprecedented\r\neconomic growth, the quality of human development does\r\nnot always reflect that progress. While many countries of\r\nthe developing world are struggling with the implications\r\nof trade liberalization and globalization, individuals within\r\nthese societies are faced with a complementary struggle.\r\nThe sad fact is that as long as selective liberalization\r\nbetween countries remains, individuals within countries\r\nwill find it more difficult to escape the downward spiral\r\ninto the depths of poverty. It hardly takes a stretch of the\r\nimagination to recognize, therefore, that an early\r\ninvestment in building human capacity is incumbent upon\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nany society wishing to achieve economic and social\r\ndevelopment that is both equitable and sustainable.\r\nWhile it can truly be said that the 1990s signalled the\r\nend of the cold war and witnessed the dissolution of a\r\nbipolar world, the conflicts we are witnessing today are\r\nlocalized and appear to be gathering momentum as a result\r\nof ethnic, religious and civil considerations. There is clearly\r\nan upsurge of micronationalism, which fosters separatist\r\nconsiderations. There is much social disruption, mass\r\nstarvation and the spread of contagious diseases. Of an\r\nextremely frightening nature is the fact that access to\r\nvictims is often rendered difficult or impossible. There is\r\nclearly a deepening lack of security for relief personnel and\r\nsupplies. Clearly, there is a need for the demobilization of\r\nparamilitary groups, for demining and for an intensification\r\nof peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nIt must be recalled that the United Nations came into\r\nexistence to ensure peace among nations. With that in mind,\r\nwe should be prepared to take steps beyond a Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty and a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty and move towards the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction within a time-bound framework.\r\nResponses to the myriad of desperate problems have\r\nto be interdisciplinary in nature, for there is no single\r\nUnited Nations agency that can control, pacify, and\r\nrehabilitate effectively.\r\nRecognizing the dangers of increased international\r\ncriminal activity in the region, Antigua and Barbuda is\r\nworking with its neighbours and expects to receive\r\nadditional assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources\r\nto initiate a national drug and money-laundering control\r\npolicy. Priorities of the policy include legislative and\r\nregulatory reform, increased interdiction activities, technical\r\ntraining, preventive health and public education and\r\ntraining. Given its multidimensional nature, the drug\r\nproblem is one that the United Nations system is\r\nparticularly well equipped to address.\r\nHowever, working alone, the Organization is helpless\r\nto tackle this scourge that cuts across all sectors of society,\r\nimpacting on families, health and economic activity. There\r\nneeds to be greater coordination among nations if the blight\r\nof narcotics is to be tackled in a meaningful way. Strong\r\nand determined efforts within certain countries will be\r\nseriously undermined if there is not a united global\r\napproach to manifestations and practices that will destroy\r\nnot only the fabric of our societies but the lives of\r\ncountless individuals.\r\nThe plague of terrorism must be controlled. The\r\nappeals of two South Asian nations to have an\r\ninternational convention against terrorism must be heeded.\r\nOften, terrorism is linked to narcotics. Not only do the\r\nStates of the eastern Caribbean have fears of subversion,\r\nthey are also concerned by the intense violations of ports\r\nand harbours and the corresponding graft as their\r\ncountries serve as transit points.\r\nIn concluding, I would like to say that as the\r\nrepresentatives of the global community we have to live\r\nup to the trust placed in us by our constituencies.\r\nMultilateralism must be paramount as we strive toward\r\nways and means for better management of our planet. We\r\nmust agree on common values for common survival. Our\r\nconstituents are calling for an end to senseless violence\r\nand for the re-emergence of concepts of compassion and\r\nequity. They are asking for our dialogue to be creative\r\nand forward-looking.\r\nThe peoples of different regions must be prepared to\r\nmake sacrifices and to suppress the barriers that divide —\r\nbarriers such as hatred, selfishness and bitterness. Let us\r\nnot forget the words of Philip Vundla, an executive of the\r\nAfrican National Congress, who said:\r\n“What you achieve by violence, you will need\r\ngreater violence to maintain. Those who say the\r\nanswer is bloodshed have other people’s blood in\r\nmind, not their own.”\r\nHowever, the fundamental need in regard to\r\nadvancement remains that of economic reality. Michel\r\nCamdessus of the International Monetary Fund reminded\r\nthe leaders of the G-7 countries on 24 June that:\r\n“Too many refusals to grant development assistance\r\nhave the alibi that such funds are wasted. This\r\nslippage, as well as the so-called donor fatigue, must\r\nbe vigorously combated if the international\r\ncommunity wishes to be in a position to keep the\r\npoorest countries from marginalization and to steer\r\nthe world away from the tensions and crises that\r\nextreme poverty cannot but engender whenever it\r\noccurs. Marginalization is not inevitable, and every\r\ncountry has its opportunity in this globalized world.”\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nMy country recognizes the fact that we are in an era\r\nof unprecedented change and opportunity, a period in which\r\nscientific developments and technological achievements\r\nseem almost miraculous and offer an improved quality of\r\nlife. The United Nations should become embedded in\r\nreality and push the critical issues involving destitution and\r\nsocial injustice to the centre of both national and public\r\ndebate.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda takes pride in and cherishes the\r\nUnited Nations and we believe that it has been judged,\r\nunjustly, more by its failures than by its successes. But the\r\nwork done in regard to health, human rights, peacekeeping\r\nactivities, disaster mitigation and assistance to developing\r\ncountries presents an enviable record.\r\nThe United Nations has the capacity for achievements\r\nin areas beyond the reach of national or regional authorities.\r\nSubsequently, the nations that comprise this body must\r\nredouble their collective commitment to translating vision\r\ninto reality. In this way, we will thrust the United Nations\r\nmanfully forward into the dawning twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the general debate for this meeting.\r\nTwo delegations have asked to speak in exercise of the\r\nright of reply. I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to 5 minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Kebede (Ethiopia): It was not my delegation’s\r\nintention to speak at this juncture. My delegation regrets\r\nthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sudan referred in\r\nhis policy statement to an issue of which the Security\r\nCouncil is seized and with regard to which the Council has\r\nadopted successive resolutions, which, regrettably, the\r\nGovernment of Sudan continues to defy today.\r\nThe points to which the Foreign Minister of Sudan\r\nattempted specifically to draw the Assembly’s attention are\r\npart and parcel of the public relations exercise pursued by\r\nSudan. That exercise is not relevant, nor do the facts lend\r\ncredibility to what he attempted to portray.\r\nIn its relations with all its neighbours, the Government\r\nof the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia pursues a\r\npolicy of good-neighbourliness based on respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States and non-\r\ninterference in their internal affairs. In light of those\r\ncardinal principles, the Government of Ethiopia has taken\r\nseveral practical measures it feels can play a pivotal role\r\nin fostering all-round cooperation in the region. However,\r\nthis constructive policy has been frustrated and our\r\npolitical commitment to working for a better future has\r\nbeen misused by the Sudanese authorities for their own\r\npurposes.\r\nThe Sudanese Government abused the prerogative of\r\na sovereign State by issuing Sudanese passports, both\r\ndiplomatic and regular, to help non-Sudanese terrorists\r\ntravel freely to Ethiopia. It used its national carrier to\r\ntransport terrorists. It made and continues to make\r\nfinancial resources and sanctuary available to terrorists\r\nand provided the very weapon used to commit the\r\ncowardly act.\r\nThe fact that the Sudanese authorities were involved\r\nin the failed attempt on the life of the Egyptian President\r\non 26 June 1995 in Addis Ababa and that they continue\r\nto obstruct justice by sheltering the terrorists wanted in\r\nconnection with the assassination attempt is as clear as\r\nday and does not require illustration at this stage.This has\r\nbeen clearly recognized in all relevant decisions of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and in the three resolutions\r\nof the Security Council adopted on the matter.\r\nThe assertion that evidence and information relating\r\nto the suspects was not provided to the authorities of the\r\nSudan is devoid of truth. The Sudanese Government was\r\nprovided with pertinent facts and evidence, including\r\nnames, nationalities and known addresses of the terrorists.\r\nThe claim of the Government of the Sudan that it has\r\ntried to locate the three culprits has no credibility.\r\nSudanese authorities were aware of the location of the\r\nthree before, during and after the assassination attempt, as\r\nwell as when extradition requests from Ethiopia were\r\nreceived.\r\nThe evidence gleaned from those apprehended and\r\nthe material evidence attest beyond the shadow of a doubt\r\nnot only to the involvement of the Sudanese authorities,\r\nbut also to the fact that they provided shelter and\r\nsanctuary to the three terrorists sought in connection with\r\nthe assassination attempt.\r\nRegarding the trials of the three suspects in Ethiopia,\r\nit should be pointed out that it is quite common for\r\ndomestic legislation, including constitutions, to provide\r\nfor circumstances under which trials may be held in\r\ncamera. Moreover, under international law it is\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\npermissible to exclude the public and the press from all or\r\nany part of a trial for reasons of national security, public\r\norder or morals, when the interests of the personal lives of\r\nthe parties so require or, in the court’s view, where\r\npublicity would prejudice the interests of justice. The\r\ndecision of the Ethiopian court, which is fully in conformity\r\nwith article 20 of the Ethiopian Constitution, to hold the\r\ntrial of the three defendants in camera is also fully\r\nconsistent with the standards of international law. In light\r\nof the foregoing, my delegation finds outrageous and\r\nunacceptable the reference made in the Sudanese statement\r\nto the trial of the three terrorists convicted for the crime\r\nthey committed.\r\nLastly, we call upon the Government of the Sudan to\r\ncease its sponsorship of international terrorism and return\r\nto the fold of responsible and law-abiding nations. We also\r\ncall on the Sudan to hand over the three suspects to\r\nEthiopia and to show its determination and commitment to\r\nwork for genuine regional economic and political\r\ncooperation that could ensure a better future for the peoples\r\nof the entire region.\r\nMr. Eltinay (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): The\r\nstatement by the Minister for External Relations of Sudan\r\nbefore the General Assembly this morning called for\r\ncooperation and solidarity. He denounced armed conflict\r\namong States and called for non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of States and support for the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nMy delegation wishes to respond to the remarks made\r\nthis afternoon. We did not intend to do so, but the\r\nerroneous statements by the representatives of Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea oblige us to do so.\r\nThe remarks by the representative of Eritrea take us\r\nback to the cold-war era. I would like to ask the\r\nrepresentative of Eritrea a question: When did Eritrea\r\nachieve its independence? How can he explain his claim\r\nthat Sudan began its aggressive policy vis-à-vis Eritrea as\r\nfar back as 1989, when everyone knows that Sudan has\r\nprovided unlimited support to the Eritrean people for more\r\nthan 30 years. Indeed, support was given to the current\r\nGovernment in Eritrea for the holding of the referendum on\r\nEritrea’s self-determination, which in turn led to its\r\nindependence in 1993. We provide such assistance to the\r\nfraternal people of Eritrea without any expectation of\r\nreturn. This is a brother’s duty.\r\nAs for the attempts to raise the issue of the refugees\r\nto which the Sudan has acted as host for more than 30\r\nyears, I would add that, in the interim, some of them have\r\nobtained Sudanese nationality. They have shared bread\r\nand salt with the Sudanese people and have joined in all\r\naspects of Sudanese society. I do not need to recall here\r\nthat Eritrea, which refused the return of Eritreans to their\r\nhomeland after independence on the pretext that it lacked\r\nthe necessary infrastructure to absorb them — a refusal of\r\nwhich the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees is fully aware — cannot\r\nadmit here that it limits the return of refugees solely to\r\nmembers of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, to the\r\nexception of all others. That is a flagrant breach of all\r\nnorms and rules governing refugees.\r\nThe international community has adopted clear rules\r\ngoverning international relations. Any act outside such\r\nrules is a breach of international norms and standards. On\r\n10 May 1996, the Eritrean Head of State announced to\r\nthe international community and media, including the\r\nBBC and The Economist, his intention to provide\r\nunconditional and unlimited armed support to the\r\nSudanese opposition in order to overthrow the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan.\r\nHow does the Assembly regard a State that turns\r\nover a neighbouring country’s embassy to that\r\nneighbour’s armed opposition? Is this the behaviour of\r\ncivilized States or is it, rather, behaviour that threatens\r\ninternational peace and security? I would merely recall\r\nthe information provided to the Security Council by the\r\nSudan with regard to the dispatch of Eritrean forces to\r\nattack Sudanese civilians. Killings took place, properties\r\nwere destroyed and bridges were blown up in the very\r\nsame area that was, for more than 17 years, a haven for\r\nthe present leaders of Eritrea.\r\nNow, we have renewed claims against the Sudan.\r\nThe sole aim of statements made by Eritrea in both the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\r\nNations, notwithstanding Sudan’s unlimited support for\r\nEritrea, is to bite the hand that once fed it. Sudan’s efforts\r\nto normalize relations between the two countries represent\r\nthe only element of stability in the region. The aggression\r\nagainst Sudan is a dead end that can serve the interests of\r\nneither people, nor those of other peoples in the region.\r\nAs for the comments made by the representative of\r\nEthiopia, I should like to state before the Assembly that\r\nmy country’s relations with Ethiopia prior to the\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 7 October 1996\r\nregrettable attempt on the life of the Egyptian President,\r\nwhich was condemned by Sudan along with all the world’s\r\nStates, were normal and excellent. Even 30 days or more\r\nafter the assassination attempt, relations remained normal.\r\nThen we were surprised by a dramatic transformation in\r\nEthiopia’s position and its accusations against Sudan.\r\nEthiopia has claimed that such accusations were made by\r\nthe culprits in their custody, who were then tried in camera\r\nwhile the Security Council itself rejected the allegations of\r\nthe three so-called culprits.\r\nI think we have the right to wonder: Does Sudan,\r\naccused of terrorism by people held in custody, not have\r\nthe right to confront its accusers or to obtain the text of\r\nsuch confessions? Or is the international community not\r\nentitled to obtain such texts, given the Security Council’s\r\nimposition of sanctions against the Sudan on the basis of\r\nthe same allegations? Such questions, I believe, are\r\nlegitimate ones.\r\nThe statement of my Foreign Minister did not\r\nexceed the bounds of legitimacy in any way. We believe\r\nthat the remarks of the representative of Ethiopia with\r\nregard to strong evidence against the Sudan to be\r\nunfounded. The Security Council never heard one iota of\r\nproof of Ethiopia’s allegations or their veracity.\r\nThe other question I should like to raise with the\r\nrepresentative of Ethiopia is the following: Is the fact that\r\nSudan has provided and continues to provide every\r\nsupport to Ethiopia, including the prevention of any act of\r\naggression against it from inside Sudanese territory, not\r\nsufficient to ensure Ethiopia’s cooperation or at the least\r\nthe provision of information requested by Sudan regarding\r\nthe alleged culprits now in Ethiopia, not to mention the\r\nOAU request for such information?\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\nagenda item 15 (b) entitled, “Election of eighteen\r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council”, will be\r\ntaken up on Thursday, 31 October, in the morning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
