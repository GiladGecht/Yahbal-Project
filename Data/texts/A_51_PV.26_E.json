(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is the Chairman of\r\nthe delegation of Djibouti, Mr. Roble Olhaye, on whom I\r\nnow call.\r\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti): My delegation offers its\r\nwarmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at what will certainly\r\nbe a crucial session. We have come to know you over the\r\nyears, and have never failed to admire and appreciate your\r\nrelentless activism, plain-speaking and valuable\r\ncontributions. We have no doubt that your unique\r\nexperience, coupled with your keen awareness of the issues\r\non which we will have to deliberate, augur well for a most\r\nproductive session.\r\nWe also wish to record our gratitude to Mr. Freitas do\r\nAmaral, the outgoing President, for his direction and\r\nfocused leadership during the historic fiftieth anniversary\r\nsession. Much of the pace and progress in United Nations\r\nreform efforts and activities this year are largely due to his\r\ncommitment to achieving a meaningful and balanced\r\noutcome on this difficult issue.\r\nWe would also like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the perseverance\r\nand dedication with which he has undertaken his duties.\r\nSaddled as it is with diminishing resources and increasing\r\nuncertainty regarding its role and mandate, the United\r\nNations is going through trying times. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral, however, has, against all odds, maintained the\r\ncontinuity and functioning of the Secretariat, tackling the\r\ndaily challenges facing mankind.\r\nMy delegation, in conformity with the decision and\r\nrecommendation of the League of Arab States and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, supports the re-election\r\nbid of the Secretary-General for another term in order to\r\nenable him to accomplish the objectives of his mission.\r\nFifty years ago, with great energy, grand vision and\r\na considerable measure of optimism, the world embarked\r\nupon a high-minded journey to end the scourge of war,\r\neliminate poverty and create a world of freedom and\r\njustice for all. Much has been accomplished, and it cannot\r\nbe denied that humankind now has the power and\r\nresources to achieve the goals we set ourselves.\r\nYet too many dreams remain shattered, too much\r\npotential remains unfulfilled, and too many conflicts\r\nremain in too many parts of the globe. The United\r\nNations is bracing itself for more turbulent times ahead,\r\nwith bankruptcy on the horizon as it confronts the threat\r\nto either “reform or perish”. Remarkably, there is a placid\r\nair of “business as usual” pervading this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly — a dream state in which all is well\r\nand normal. Given the dire predicament threatening the\r\nexistence of this Organization, does this reveal a measure\r\nof resignation? Is this the beginning of the end of the\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nenthusiastic hope for a new world order with which this\r\ndecade began? Does this explain why so many opportunities\r\nto address the pressing problems of our day have not been\r\nrealized? While politically the world might be in a state of\r\nflux and transition, economically, however, it has enjoyed\r\nan unprecedented level of output — enough for every man,\r\nwoman and child on this planet to enjoy a happy and secure\r\nlife.\r\nThe vast majority of the people of the world, however,\r\nhave received minimal benefit. The facts are foreboding.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\ninforms us that over the last decade income levels in some\r\n70 developing countries were lower than in the 1960s or\r\n1970s. The Administrator of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme tellingly reminds us that the\r\nbelief that the developing world is doing very much better\r\nis one of the great myths of the present. In fact, three fifths\r\nof the world’s population live in poverty, millions are\r\nforced to migrate every year, and 15 per cent suffer from\r\nchronic hunger and malnutrition. All this is taking place\r\nwhile world food production and reserves are declining in\r\nthe face of population growth. As most of us realize, much\r\nof this stagnation is taking place in Africa.\r\nFor all the oft-cited reasons — historical, colonial or\r\ncontemporary — Africa has been lagging behind on the\r\nmarch to self-sustaining growth. Consequently, 50 per cent\r\nof its peoples live in poverty, with a quality of life that is\r\nnot expected to improve during this decade. While the\r\nincreasing flow of negative statistics on Africa tends to\r\nmask the substantial efforts for reform, pluralization and\r\nstructural adjustment that are taking place in many countries\r\non the continent, for most people the situation is life-\r\nthreatening.\r\nThere are, however, a few hopeful signs that the\r\nextent of Africa’s predicament has begun to draw the\r\ncritical attention it needs from the international community.\r\nIn particular, the 10-year United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, launched in March by the\r\nSecretary-General, deserves a special mention. Although it\r\ndoes not represent new funding so much as the more\r\nefficient use of available resources, it should prove useful.\r\nTogether with this initiative, the formal endorsement\r\nlast week by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and\r\nthe World Bank, during their annual meeting in\r\nWashington, of a plan to substantially reduce the debt\r\nburden of the world’s poorest and most heavily indebted\r\nnations, most of which are in Africa, is very encouraging.\r\nIf current economic reform measures are to have the\r\ndesired impact, debt relief is crucial, particularly in\r\nreversing Africa’s increasing marginalization.\r\nBut problems of degradation, poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment are hardly unique to Africa; they are\r\nfound in every corner of the world, and must be seriously\r\naddressed if we are to rectify the frightening pace of\r\nglobal polarization, both within and between countries.\r\nAccording to the Administrator of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, we are creating a planet that,\r\nincreasingly, is not one world but two.\r\nFor all these reasons, the World Food Summit in\r\nRome next month, and the designation of the decade\r\n1997-2006 as the first United Nations Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty will provide the international\r\ncommunity with an opportunity to renew its commitment\r\nrealistically to face those twin scourges of humankind.\r\nThe conventional wisdom of today argues that the basic\r\nremedy for underdevelopment lies in embracing free and\r\nopen market economies, stimulated by private capital. To\r\nthis end, the bulk of the world is engaged in restructuring\r\nto fit this mould. But with the dramatic shrinkage of the\r\nresources needed for transitional development —\r\nparticularly those for official development assistance —\r\nself-sufficiency has become an almost impossible task.\r\nCompounding this dilemma, total private investment has\r\nquadrupled since 1990, but only in ways that bypass most\r\ndeveloping countries and fail to address their problems.\r\nThe world remains laden with conflicts. It has been\r\nsaid that as many as 25 complex emergencies now\r\nthreaten tens of millions of people worldwide every year,\r\nthat the convulsions are becoming larger, with wider\r\nrepercussions, and that this new generation of crises will\r\ncontinue until their underlying causes are properly\r\naddressed. Cold-war identities have lost relevance, and\r\nold identities and animosities have resurfaced. Many\r\nnation States have lost considerable cohesion and are\r\nbeing buffeted by external pressures and strains within.\r\nThe consequent void of economic and political instability\r\nhas provided an opening for many unscrupulous, self-\r\nproclaimed “leaders” who, hungry for power, are\r\nreigniting the myths, latent prejudices, hatreds and fears\r\nlying in the dark recesses of so many minds. Employing\r\nviolence, propaganda and intimidation, such as we have\r\nseen in Bosnia, Somalia, Cambodia and elsewhere, they\r\nhave successfully pitted peoples against peoples. The\r\npredictable result has been an explosion in the number of\r\narmed conflicts, accompanied by widespread devastation,\r\nboth human and physical, gross violations of human\r\nrights, and “ethnic cleansing”. This is a situation\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nincreasingly in need of concerted international action and a\r\nstrong, focused and impartial United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations has, indeed, responded positively\r\nin many instances. Cambodia and Mozambique are cases in\r\npoint. Some crises, however, have proved intractable,\r\ninvariably because of the nature of mandates or the political\r\nwill of Member States, whose changing views and policies\r\nhave affected the prospects for early resolution. Had the\r\ninternational community acted with dispatch in crisis\r\nsituations, countless lives could have been saved and scarce\r\nresources conserved by forcing the belligerents to disarm\r\nunconditionally and to respect the rule of law.\r\nThe widespread and indiscriminate use of anti-\r\npersonnel mines in many conflict situations has been\r\nconsistently devastating. We therefore welcome the Security\r\nCouncil statement of 30 August 1996 indicating the high\r\npriority being given to demining. The effectiveness of\r\npeacekeeping will be greatly enhanced by making demining\r\nan integral part of it. Sadly, however, these commendable\r\nmeasures will continue to fall short of what is required\r\nunless the international community imposes a moratorium,\r\nif not a total ban, on the manufacture and deployment of\r\nsuch devices. In the same vein, we hope that the adoption\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will provide\r\nan impetus to increased international cooperation, in\r\naddition to marking a first viable step towards the total\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe problems, conflicts and challenges of development\r\nand international cooperation are growing in complexity.\r\nNot surprisingly, therefore, as so many have noted, the\r\nUnited Nations system needs to be renewed and enabled to\r\nrespond to these simultaneous challenges.\r\nOver the past two years, and particularly in the first\r\nhalf of this year, a number of High-level Open-ended\r\nWorking Groups of the General Assembly have extensively\r\nexplored and deliberated on issues of reform as they\r\nimpinge upon the financial situation, the enlargement,\r\ncomposition and transparency of the Security Council, and\r\nthe Secretariat and General Assembly. Considerable time,\r\nenergy and resources have been expended in these efforts.\r\nHowever, differences persist among nations, reflecting\r\ndivergent national policies, views and interests.\r\nAs might be expected, a proliferation of ideas and\r\npositions is emerging from individual countries, including,\r\nto name just a few, the United States, Italy, Belize and\r\nMalaysia, which have produced proposals and statements of\r\nposition. Regional groups, including those in Africa, and\r\nalliances and coalitions, including the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, have their own positions. All of them are\r\njockeying for position so as to advance and strengthen\r\ntheir individual or collective interests. The stalemate over\r\nSecurity Council reform is far from over and remains the\r\ntoughest problem. The real stumbling block is the number\r\nand composition of the new permanent membership,\r\nwhich must include developing countries from all parts of\r\nthe world, including Africa, Asia and Latin America. We\r\nmust also recognize that constructive participation in the\r\nCouncil by many smaller States has demonstrated that the\r\npossession of large economies and large populations\r\ncannot be the exclusive criteria for permanent\r\nmembership.\r\nThe tense circumstances persisting in a number of\r\nStates in the Great Lakes region of Africa is a cause of\r\nconcern to my country. This is true of Rwanda, where\r\nbloated prisons, camps swollen with refugees and the\r\nslow pace of the judicial process are just a few of the\r\nproblems that continue to plague that country. The\r\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda has begun to function,\r\nbut with limited manpower and financial resources. The\r\nTribunal must be seen to function effectively, as the\r\nmessage it sends is crucial to resolving the Rwandan\r\nproblem.\r\nIn neighbouring Burundi, the international\r\ncommunity remains haunted by the fear of a re-enactment\r\nof the horrors that took place in Rwanda over two years\r\nago, where tens of thousands were massacred. There has\r\nalready been a frightful human toll in Burundi since the\r\narmy murdered the first democratically elected President\r\nin 1993, marking the advent of instability and violence.\r\nShould the army — the de facto head of State and\r\nsupreme authority since 1993 — remain unprepared to\r\naccept the authority of a democratically elected civilian\r\ngovernment, we may have a recipe for uncontrolled\r\nbloodshed. That is the real problem confronting the\r\ninternational community in resolving the Burundi debacle.\r\nDjibouti fully supports the efforts of the countries in the\r\nregion in imposing sanctions, whose objective is to\r\ncompel the new regime in Bujumbura to restore\r\nconstitutional order and legality and to hand over power\r\nto a legitimately elected government.\r\nWith the explosion of violence in the territories\r\noccupied by Israel, we have witnessed an alarming\r\ndeterioration in prospects for peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe Israeli act of opening a tunnel under one of Islam’s\r\nholiest shrines, the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem,\r\nwas yet another example of disrespect for, as well as\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\ndefiance of, international opinion. But more importantly, it\r\nwas yet another example of intransigent rule over East\r\nJerusalem.\r\nIt is difficult to deny that the ultimate Israeli aim is to\r\nchange the ground rules — in effect, unilaterally to redefine\r\nthe peace process, thereby rolling back the clock and\r\nreversing years of hard work, concessions, sacrifice and\r\ngood faith on the part of the previous Israeli Government,\r\nthe Palestinians, the Arabs, and the international\r\ncommunity. It is also disturbing that, while the world is\r\nwatching, Israel should decide openly to pursue a policy of\r\ncreating “facts on the ground” in total disregard of the\r\nprinciples established in Oslo, the Washington peace\r\nagreement and United Nations resolutions, all of which\r\nemphasize the return of occupied land in exchange for\r\npeace. It is little wonder that the current talks between\r\nMr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat, which began last week in\r\nWashington, have neither produced nor resolved anything.\r\nWhat we see instead are Israeli promises or commitments\r\nto keep talking to the Palestinians. But there has been\r\nneither an action nor a promise to implement what had\r\nalready been agreed upon, or even to contemplate the start\r\nof final status negotiations.\r\nThe depth of Arab disillusionment is obvious. The\r\nhard line policies pursued by the new Government are\r\nsimply fuelling fires of hatred and violence. Djibouti hopes\r\nthat reason will prevail, and calls on key countries and\r\nregions to continue providing the necessary direction,\r\nleadership and reassurances for a return to previous\r\ncommitments. Having come so far and sacrificed so much,\r\nand with so much at stake, we must not allow the peace\r\nprocess to drift or wither away. In this context, we also\r\nwish to underscore the urgent call of the Arab Summit in\r\nCairo in June for Israel to resume the peace process within\r\nthe framework of the Madrid Conference, in accordance\r\nwith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973)\r\nand 425 (1978).\r\nWe share the anxiety in the Gulf region about the state\r\nof the three islands of the United Arab Emirates that have\r\nbeen occupied by Iran, and we hope that this long-standing\r\nproblem will be resolved peacefully.\r\nSomalia continues to exist in a cycle of misery and\r\npolitical impasse, lacking structures, an economy, a stable\r\ncivil society or legitimate authority. More disturbing, there\r\nis neither peace nor war, and clashes continue unabated.\r\nMogadishu and its infamous warlords remain the maelstrom\r\nof Somalia. Despite almost five years of incessant fighting,\r\nthere are no signs of compromise or reconciliation. The lust\r\nfor power of a few has resulted in disaster for the whole\r\ncountry, whose condition is now a virtual replica of what\r\nit was in the nineteenth century. There is simply nowhere\r\nto lay the blame for Somalia’s wretched state except on\r\nthe warlords and their inability to reason and reach\r\nagreement. This myopic vision of leadership seems\r\nunlikely to change until one faction prevails, and that may\r\ntake years. Meanwhile, the people suffer, and the world\r\nis watching. Somalia, we must conclude, remains a\r\nfestering tragedy, a piece of unfinished business for the\r\ninternational community, an international embarrassment,\r\nand a permanent problem. It will not go away simply\r\nbecause we refuse to address it, and it will certainly\r\ncontinue to be an indelible blemish on the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe sooner we consider the far-reaching implications\r\nof the situation of this failed State, which is absent from\r\nthis Hall, the better it will be for the Somali people and\r\nthe international community. Somalia is simply consumed\r\nby an interminable turmoil from which it cannot free\r\nitself. It needs help — our help.\r\nWith the holding of elections, the saga of Bosnia has\r\nreached a decisive juncture. The problem facing the\r\ninternational community is the attempts to obstruct the\r\nnormalization process through the use of violence and\r\nintimidation, which increase the pressure for secession.\r\nHowever, one issue that is creating tremendous frustration\r\nand confusion is the reluctance of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) to apprehend the prime\r\nBosnian Serb war crime suspects — Karadžić and\r\nMladić — who are accused of instigating, planning and\r\nordering the genocide and “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia.\r\nTo date, 74 arrest warrants have been issued for suspected\r\nwar criminals, but only eight people are in custody. This\r\nfact, perhaps, reflects a political decision; but it is a\r\nparadoxical one whose effects may be with us in Bosnia\r\nand beyond for a long time.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to an issue relating to\r\nmy own part of the world. Our corner of the globe, the\r\nHorn of Africa, seems to be passing through a period of\r\nrenewed optimism and revival. This must be sustained.\r\nWith the regional economy slowly but steadily recovering\r\nfrom the effects of past turmoil, the need for enhanced\r\ncooperation cannot be overemphasized. Djibouti is\r\numbilically linked to the pulse of its neighbours and\r\ncannot, therefore, be indifferent to their economic and\r\ntrade realities.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nThe conflicts and civil strife that have plagued the\r\nHorn of Africa in the past two decades have had a\r\ndevastating effect on our economic and social life. This can\r\nbe readily observed in the unacceptable number of\r\ndisplaced persons and refugees in my small country, for\r\nwhom our continued commitment to care is proving to be\r\neconomically and socially overwhelming, if not disastrous.\r\nDjibouti’s approach to regional affairs is based on\r\nmutual respect, moderation and cooperation. We believe\r\nthat all the countries in the Horn of Africa must together\r\nseek to resolve the common problems of poverty, conflict\r\nand underdevelopment, bilaterally and within the framework\r\nof the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and\r\nDevelopment (IGADD), whose revitalization is crucial.\r\nDjibouti is in the midst of economic restructuring and\r\ninstitutional reforms. Given the demobilization process that\r\nis now under way, we require generous assistance from the\r\ninternational donor community. Towards this end, we are\r\nplanning to organize a round table early next year, under\r\nthe aegis of the UNDP and the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nto address these problems and the accumulated effects of\r\nregional instability. We have made a valiant effort, and we\r\nremain convinced that the donor community will, for its\r\npart, work with us in order to surmount our multiple\r\nchallenges and create a better future for our citizens.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Bangladesh, His Excellency Mr. Abdus Samad\r\nAzad.\r\nMr. Azad (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bengali; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Mr. President, please\r\naccept our heartfelt congratulations on the assumption of\r\nyour high office. Your unanimous election is a tribute to\r\nyour great country, with which we enjoy friendly and\r\nfraternal relations. It is also a testimony to your diplomatic\r\nskills and personal standing in this world forum, where, on\r\nso many occasions, you have articulated most persuasively\r\nthe concerns of the international community, particularly\r\nthose of the marginalized and vulnerable. You are assured\r\nof the unstinting support of my delegation in the discharge\r\nof your very heavy responsibilities.\r\nI should like to convey to your predecessor, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its historic fiftieth\r\nsession, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, our\r\nappreciation for a job well done.\r\nI should also like to pay a special tribute to our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In a very\r\nreal sense, he is the first Secretary-General of the post-\r\ncold-war period, and has had to contend with issues and\r\nproblems that were perhaps furthest from the minds and\r\nintentions of the founding fathers of our Organization. To\r\nhis high office he has brought to bear clarity of vision\r\nand purpose, and a remarkable ability — as we have seen\r\nfrom two seminal reports, on the Agenda for Peace and\r\nthe Agenda for Development — to present complex\r\nanalyses and facts in a simple, distilled form. For nearly\r\nhalf a decade, he has handled what was once described by\r\none of his predecessors as “the most impossible job on\r\nthis earth” with verve, dignity and integrity.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nOver two decades ago, the father of our nation,\r\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its twenty-ninth session, soon after\r\nBangladesh’s entry into the United Nations as a fully-\r\nfledged Member. In his speech he outlined some cardinal\r\ntenets, the basic focus and thrust of our foreign policy,\r\nand our domestic priorities. These hold good even today,\r\nin a world that has undergone radical transformation. As\r\nBangabandhu stated, our foreign policy is based on the\r\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence and friendship towards\r\nall.\r\nOur political party, the Awami League, has only\r\nrecently been returned to office, through the process of\r\ngeneral elections, after a gap of more than 20 years. As\r\nwas stressed by our leader at the twenty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, our total commitment to peace is\r\nborn of the realization that only in an environment of\r\npeace can our people concentrate their energies and\r\nresources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger,\r\ndisease, illiteracy and unemployment that still beset a\r\nlarge proportion of humankind. We naturally place special\r\nimportance and emphasis on the development of good-\r\nneighbourly relations with the countries of our region, on\r\nthe basis of universally accepted principles of peaceful\r\ncoexistence, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity and non-interference in each other’s internal\r\naffairs. We identify wholeheartedly with the aspirations\r\nand hopes of developing countries in general, particularly\r\nthose belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement, and share\r\na special affinity with the fraternal member States of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). We share\r\nwith our development partners the goal of improving the\r\nquality of life of our people, and our relations with them\r\nare of the greatest significance to us.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nThe existence of friendly and good-neighbourly\r\nrelations does not necessarily preclude the emergence of\r\nproblems. What these can ensure, however, is that the best\r\nof political will, goodwill and good intentions are brought\r\nto bear in seeking solutions to any outstanding problems or\r\nany new ones that may arise. Such an approach would go\r\na long way towards resolving any differences or disputes.\r\nOur outstanding problem with India over the sharing\r\nof the waters of the Ganges River is not unknown to this\r\nforum. Water resources play a predominant role in the\r\nsocio-economic development of a country. For Bangladesh,\r\nthe availability of fresh river water in adequate volumes is\r\nindispensable for purposes of agriculture, irrigation,\r\nfisheries, river traffic, maintaining ecological and\r\nenvironmental balance and preventing the intrusion of\r\nsalinity. The importance that we attach to this issue cannot\r\nbe overemphasized and we have resumed bilateral\r\ndiscussions with India, in an atmosphere of mutual\r\nconfidence and trust, to resolve this vexed problem\r\namicably and equitably so that our legitimate concerns can\r\nbe met.\r\nOn the subject of water resources, I should like to\r\ndigress a little from the purely national and also bilateral\r\ncontext, because the shortage of fresh water resources is\r\nnot, let me emphasize, unique or peculiar to Bangladesh or\r\nour region. Even from the international perspective, it is an\r\nissue of primal significance. According to a recent strategy\r\npaper of the Committee on Natural Resources of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, by the year 2025, 52\r\ncountries with a total population of more than 3 billion\r\npeople will be water-stressed or face chronic water scarcity.\r\nThe problem has as much to do with the availability of\r\nfresh water in the overall global context as with the fact\r\nthat such resources, even when available in abundant\r\nquantities, may be found in the wrong places or are\r\navailable at the wrong times. The problem, therefore, is\r\nintimately and intricately linked to efficient water\r\nmanagement.\r\nThe question of water is not new to the global agenda\r\nand, since the Mar del Plata Conference in March of 1977,\r\nthere have been international programmes on water-related\r\nissues. It has not, however, in our view, received the\r\npriority that it deserves. An international code of conduct\r\nfor water-sharing was provided for in the Mar del Plata\r\nAction Plan and, as the strategy paper of the Committee on\r\nNatural Resources suggests, an international code of water\r\nethics is needed more urgently today than ever before as a\r\nguide to help countries in their efforts to reach bilateral and\r\nmultilateral agreements. The paper also suggests an\r\ninternational convention on freshwater resources along the\r\nlines of those that already exist on biodiversity, ozone\r\ndepletion and climate change. In particular, the paper\r\nstresses that the United Nations should develop principles\r\nand ethics on sharing the joint planetary freshwater\r\nresources. These are ideas that, in our view, warrant\r\nserious consideration by the world community.\r\nReverting to the subject of our Government’s\r\npriorities, let me just add that, in the domestic sphere, like\r\nall other developing countries, we are striving for a\r\nhuman development paradigm that will prioritize people,\r\nespecially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors.\r\nWe will pursue a programme of reforms with emphasis\r\non our domestic considerations: poverty alleviation and\r\neconomic growth with social justice. The social sectors\r\nwill receive special attention.\r\nThe 1990s has been a period of democratic renewal.\r\nOur Government firmly believes that it is as important,\r\nand perhaps more difficult, to live up to great principles\r\nand ideas as to fight for their realization. That is why we\r\nshall strive to strengthen our polity through institutions\r\nand laws.\r\nThrough constitutional amendment, an important\r\ninnovation for democratic institutions and practice was\r\neffected in Bangladesh, following overwhelming popular\r\ndemand, prior to our general elections in June. Three\r\nmonths before general elections are to be held, the\r\nGovernment will demit office and hand over power to a\r\nnon-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be\r\nheaded by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the\r\ncountry and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities\r\nappointed on his advice, keeping in mind the sensitivities\r\nof the major political parties. The principal mandate of\r\nthe caretaker Government will be to ensure free and fair\r\ngeneral elections to be conducted by an independent\r\nconstitutional authority, the Election Commission. Foreign\r\nobservers were welcome to observe the electoral process,\r\ncompletely unhindered, in 1996 and 1991. Reports\r\nsubmitted by international observers can be of help in\r\nidentifying any shortcomings or gaps that may exist and\r\nalso contain constructive suggestions for improvement.\r\nThese steps are the national equivalents of confidence-\r\nbuilding measures between and among States.\r\nDemocracy, of course, goes well beyond the holding\r\nof periodic general elections. It is a continuous process\r\nand even a culture and ethos, which above all denote a\r\ncertain approach and attitude to governance. We in\r\nBangladesh see democracy as more than a laudable and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\ndesirable objective. In the long term, democratic and\r\naccountable government affords the most efficacious and\r\nstable medium to develop the economy of a State and to\r\nachieve prosperity for its people. The very apposite point\r\nhas been made, however, that democracy cannot on its own\r\nbe a panacea for the diverse problems that confront many\r\ncountries. There must also be effective international\r\ncooperation and a supportive external economic\r\nenvironment if the major socio-economic problems are to\r\nbe meaningfully addressed.\r\nThe cold war is now truly behind us and the object\r\nnow is to win the peace. Peace is not simply the absence of\r\nwar, but should encompass every human condition,\r\nnecessity and amenity that make for a civilized and\r\ndignified life. It is inseparable from security and is the flip\r\nside of development. Political, economic and social issues\r\nare today intimately and intricately intertwined. Political\r\ninternationalism without economic internationalism can only\r\nbe likened to a house built upon sand. Most emphatically\r\nin this day and age of interdependence, no nation can\r\nachieve its fullest development alone. This is an area where\r\nthe United Nations and the United Nations system clearly\r\nhave a constructive role to play.\r\nThe main purposes of the United Nations, as outlined\r\nin Chapter I of the Charter, include the achievement of\r\ninternational cooperation in solving international problems\r\nof an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character\r\nand also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of\r\nnations in the attainment of these common ends.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions are, of course, major\r\nplayers in the field of development policy and research.\r\nThere is also, in our view, a patent need and ample\r\njustification in the Charter provisions for the United Nations\r\nand the United Nations system to play a meaningful role in\r\nglobal macroeconomic policy and strategy formulation. The\r\nUnited Nations is the universal forum for dialogue and\r\ndecisions on such issues. This is an area in which, in\r\nparticular, a revitalized Economic and Social Council can\r\nplay a constructive and fruitful role. While the United\r\nNations economic role provides special focus on\r\noperational, welfare and humanitarian activities, there is\r\ncertainly a need for greater harmony and coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations systems on the one hand and\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions on the other.\r\nOn the subject of development, let me reaffirm that a\r\nsupportive external environment is an indispensable\r\nsupplement to national efforts and policies. Poverty is\r\narguably the prime source of world disorder and needs to\r\nbe addressed, inter alia, through sustained and enhanced\r\nflows of resources from the North to the countries of the\r\nSouth. The gap between North and South is widening at\r\nan ominous rate. In 1890, the wealth of each European\r\nwas twice that of a South Asian. Today, the gap is 70-\r\nfold. In 1960, the per capita gross national product of the\r\nrichest 20 per cent of States was 30 times higher than that\r\nof the poorest 20 per cent. By 1989, the gap had widened\r\nto 60 times. By 1994, only four countries members of the\r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC) had reached\r\nthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct as official development assistance. The average\r\nfigure for DAC countries actually fell from 0.31 per cent\r\nin 1993 to 0.30 per cent in 1994. The least developed\r\ncountries’ share of world trade has plummeted in two\r\ndecades from 0.8 per cent to a mere 0.4 per cent.\r\nThe problems of the 48 least developed countries\r\ncontinue to deserve special consideration on the global\r\ndevelopment agenda. The Mid-term Global Review of the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\r\nfor the 1990s has pointed to the limited progress made in\r\nthe implementation of commitments by our development\r\npartners. The development initiatives of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries are stunted by problems associated\r\nwith formidable structural adjustment programmes, the\r\ndecline of an already low level of development resources,\r\nand the extremely low level of exports compounded by\r\nlimited market access. The debt-relief measures taken thus\r\nfar have remained grossly inadequate. We urge our\r\ndevelopment partners to adopt specific and concrete\r\nmeasures to redress these problems. We welcome the\r\nstatements of several delegations that asked the removal\r\nof barriers on the products of the least developed\r\ncountries. We believe that, at the forthcoming Ministerial\r\nMeeting of the World Trade Organization in December,\r\nevery participant will work to remove all obstacles to\r\ntrade from this vulnerable group of countries.\r\nThe problems of developing countries are also, at\r\none remove, the problems of the whole world, because\r\nprosperity, like peace and stability, is in the final analysis\r\nindivisible. For developed countries, assistance to the\r\ncountries of the South will surely constitute an investment\r\nin a more secure, stable and, I have no doubt, eventually\r\nprosperous third world. The marginalization of developing\r\ncountries would be morally indefensible, politically self-\r\ndefeating and economically counter-productive. The\r\naspirations of the South and the prosperity of the North\r\nare emphatically not mutually exclusive.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nAs the first United Nations Secretary-General put it,\r\nthe United Nations was as strong an Organization as the\r\nrepresentatives in San Francisco could agree upon. Half a\r\ncentury later, the United Nations remains the indispensable\r\nlinchpin of any international order, a role for which it is\r\nuniquely conditioned, equipped and mandated. I should like\r\nto stress here that an effective and credible United Nations\r\nis even more vital and relevant for the smaller and more\r\nvulnerable States than for the more powerful ones.\r\nIn today’s vastly altered world, the United Nations and\r\nits system offer even broader promise than what its\r\nfounding fathers could have envisioned. However, like all\r\norganizations, the United Nations system is also subject to\r\nthe Darwinian dictum of “adapt or perish”. Much thought,\r\neffort and work are therefore being devoted to the goal of\r\nmaking the United Nations more attuned and responsive to\r\nchanging times and requirements, charting its future course\r\nand defining its new emphases and priorities.\r\nThe United Nations areas of responsibility should\r\nclearly cover problems or issues between States, especially\r\nthose that are pandemic in range and global in consequence.\r\nEnvironmental degradation, human rights, burgeoning\r\npopulations, the situation and rights of women and children,\r\nthe depletion of non-renewable natural resources, drugs,\r\nmigration, international terrorism and corruption in\r\ninternational business could very well — in addition to\r\nissues of international peace, security and development —\r\nbe the topical objects of United Nations policies and\r\nactions. We would, of course, want a United Nations that\r\nis streamlined and focused, open and accountable, with\r\nprofessional management systems and structures.\r\nOn the subject of Security Council reform, a number\r\nof proposals have been mooted, including a wide-ranging\r\none by Italy. There is a broad convergence, if not\r\nconsensus, on the idea that the overall size of an expanded\r\nCouncil should not exceed a figure in the low or mid-\r\ntwenties. An agreement as to whether expansion should\r\ncover only the non-permanent category or both categories\r\nof seats, or could even include a new semi-permanent\r\ncategory, still continues to elude us. It is our view that\r\nthree aspects of the issue should be given priority.\r\nFirstly, the smaller and the more vulnerable States that\r\nby definition pose no threat to international security have\r\nthe most vital stakes in the United Nations. Their interests\r\nand concerns may not be overlooked in any restructuring of\r\nthe Council. Experience also shows that smaller countries\r\nwith no vested interests have played a more constructive\r\nrole as Council members in general.\r\nSecondly, the objective of any reform and\r\nrestructuring should be a more effective and dynamic\r\nCouncil. Nothing should be allowed to detract from this.\r\nThirdly, the moral dimension in determining criteria\r\nfor possible new categories of membership or for any\r\naddition to permanent ranks should be given due\r\nconsideration. This would include a country’s\r\ncommitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter,\r\nto democratic government and the essential freedoms,\r\nhuman rights and, in general, respect for United Nations\r\ndecisions.\r\nThe Secretary-General is the most visible symbol\r\nand personification of the United Nations and the United\r\nNations system. We see him as something more than the\r\nchief administrative officer of the Organization, as\r\nstipulated in the Charter, because he also has important\r\npolitical responsibilities. A former Secretary-General was\r\nof the view that the Secretary-General should be of help\r\nin\r\n“filling any vacuum that may appear in the systems\r\nwhich the Charter and traditional diplomacy provide\r\nfor the safeguarding of peace and security”.\r\nWhile efforts are being made to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the operational arms of the United Nations\r\nsystem, we could perhaps consider ways of strengthening\r\nthe office of Secretary-General. One idea that we would\r\ncommend for consideration is the establishment of a\r\ncommittee, along the lines of the General Committee of\r\nthe General Assembly, that the Secretary-General could\r\nconsult, formally or informally, collectively or by\r\nindividual member, on important administrative and\r\npolitical issues. Such a committee would serve useful\r\npurposes, particularly in ensuring the rightful role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFirst, it would ensure closer interaction and exchange\r\nbetween the Secretary-General and the General Assembly.\r\nSecondly, it would provide the Secretary-General the\r\nbenefit of dispassionate counsel and a feel for the\r\nthinking of Member States on issues in an institutional\r\nmanner. And, thirdly, it would make for greater\r\ntransparency in decision-making.\r\nThe objective of any reform and restructuring\r\nexercise is a strengthened United Nations that is\r\ninstitutionally better equipped to fulfil its mandate.\r\nReforms, however, can only supplement, not be a\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nsubstitute for the political will to do what is right and\r\nwarranted by the purposes and principles and other\r\nprovisions of the Charter. Over the years, when the United\r\nNations has floundered or failed, the predominant reasons\r\nwere more often, unfortunately, the lack of political will\r\nrather than insuperable local difficulties or institutional\r\nlacunas.\r\nI should like to touch very briefly upon the dismal\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations, which has become\r\nvery serious indeed. Member States have every right and\r\neven a duty to demand the best value for their money. The\r\nUnited Nations, however, must be provided the wherewithal\r\nto discharge its responsibilities. We welcome the United\r\nStates commitment to meet its financial obligations to the\r\nUnited Nations and to pay its arrears over a five-year\r\nperiod.\r\nSome interesting suggestions on United Nations reform\r\nhave emanated from the Group of Seven Summit in Lyon\r\nearlier this year. These envisage some savings from the\r\nremoval of overlap, improvement in the effectiveness of\r\nsome agencies and commissions, and consolidation and\r\nrationalization of certain programmes. I have no doubt that\r\nthe Fifth Committee and perhaps the Advisory Committee\r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions will look\r\nclosely at these proposals. We, of course, welcome the\r\nsuggestion that any savings from such reforms are planned\r\nto be reinvested in development programmes.\r\nA more realistic perspective of the expenditures\r\nincurred by the United Nations is afforded by comparing\r\nthe United Nations budget with expenses incurred in certain\r\nactivities by national or even local Governments. For\r\nexample, in 1992, the United Nations regular assessed\r\nbudget was about the size of the New York City Fire\r\nDepartment budget. In 1994, the cost of the entire United\r\nNations system, including all emergency operations, was\r\nover $10 billion, or about $2 per capita of the planet’s\r\npopulation. The expenditure on arms in the same year was\r\nabout $150 per capita.\r\nWhile every scope and avenue for greater cost-\r\neffectiveness should be explored, it is difficult to escape the\r\nconclusion that the United Nations gives good value for\r\nmoney. Expenditures on peacekeeping and the United\r\nNations system are in a real sense an investment in peace\r\nand security.\r\nDisarmament has always been accorded a very high\r\npriority in the United Nations. In particular, the question of\r\nnuclear disarmament has always received the highest\r\npriority. With the end of the cold war, there is an\r\nincreasing awareness of the need to address this issue in\r\nall earnestness. The indefinite extension of the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) last year\r\nand the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty by an overwhelming majority in the General\r\nAssembly are welcome steps towards the ultimate goal of\r\nnuclear disarmament. The International Court of Justice,\r\nin its recent Advisory Opinion on the issue of nuclear\r\nweapons, stressed the obligation\r\n“to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion\r\nnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its\r\naspects under strict and effective international\r\ncontrol”. (A/51/4, para. 182 (f))\r\nLike chemical and biological weapons, nuclear\r\nweapons must be outlawed. In the post-cold-war world,\r\nthey have became an anachronism. They do not enhance\r\ninternational security and can only imperil world peace.\r\nFor Bangladesh, the pursuit of general and complete\r\ndisarmament is a fundamental principle of State policy.\r\nAs a new member of the Conference on Disarmament, we\r\nare fully prepared to play a constructive role towards this\r\ngoal. Bangladesh, together with most members of the\r\nG-21, has submitted a proposal in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament on the elimination of nuclear weapons. This\r\nhas been circulated as a Conference on Disarmament\r\ndocument. We accept that substantial reductions are being\r\nmade under START I and START II in the nuclear\r\narsenals of the two major nuclear Powers. The\r\nuncomfortable fact remains, however, that even after\r\nSTART II is completed by the year 2003 at the latest,\r\nthere will still be more nuclear warheads in existence than\r\nin 1970, when the NPT came into force. The need to\r\nmove speedily towards a third START treaty and beyond\r\nis very obvious.\r\nPeacekeeping continues to be a most significant area\r\nof United Nations activity. The United Nations has indeed\r\nachieved some notable successes in peacekeeping\r\nmissions in recent times, examples of which include those\r\nin El Salvador, Cambodia, Haiti, Mozambique and\r\nAngola. Bangladesh is proud to play an active role in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities. Our peacekeepers\r\nhave shed their blood and sacrificed their lives in the\r\ncause of peace throughout the world.\r\nThere is room for cautious optimism on the issue of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We sincerely hope that the\r\nDayton Agreement will be implemented in its entirety and\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nthat a genuine peace will return to that beleaguered region.\r\nBangladesh will continue to support all efforts towards this\r\nobjective through regional as well as multilateral forums.\r\nRecent developments in the Middle East have been of\r\nconcern to us all. Bangladesh expressed its grave concern\r\nand outrage at the recent violence and killings that took\r\nplace in the West Bank and Gaza and the disrespect shown\r\nto the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. We call upon all concerned\r\nto honour their commitments under the peace accord with\r\na view to finding a comprehensive and lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East, which Bangladesh believes will enable the\r\nemergence of a Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its\r\ncapital. The Government and the people of Bangladesh\r\nstand by President Yasser Arafat and our Palestinian\r\nbrethren. We also reaffirm our commitment and support to\r\nthe Arab and Palestinian cause.\r\nIn a very real sense, the United Nations belongs to the\r\nentire human family. Over the years, it has been a potent\r\nmoral force and an influence for the good. It remains the\r\nonly credible vehicle that can move the world towards the\r\ngoal of international peace and prosperity. The institution\r\nof the United Nations itself, comprised of Member States\r\nlarge and small, attests to mankind’s wisdom and desire for\r\npeace. We have every confidence and hope that, in the\r\ncrucial years ahead, a revitalized United Nations will\r\ncontinue to play an effective role in deciding the\r\ntranscendent policy issues of the day.\r\nDifferences between peoples, countries and nations can\r\nand do exist, and yet all share a common vision, hopes and\r\naspirations. Good men and women all over the globe must\r\nsurely dream the same dreams of lasting peace and\r\nhappiness.\r\nOver 50 years ago, a great world leader — one of the\r\narchitects of the Atlantic Charter and one of the first\r\npersons to use the term “United Nations” — made an\r\nimpassioned plea for peace when he wrote:\r\n“We are faced with the pre-eminent fact that if\r\ncivilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science\r\nof human relationship — the ability of peoples of all\r\nkinds to live together and work together in the same\r\nworld at peace.”\r\nPresident Roosevelt did not live to speak those words,\r\nwhich he wrote for what would have been his last address.\r\nHis words are surely relevant even today.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Chairman of the delegation of\r\nAzerbaijan, His Excellency Mr. Eldar Kouliev.\r\nMr. Kouliev (Azerbaijan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): I wish to make a statement on behalf of the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail on his election to the high post of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, which attests\r\nto the recognition of Malaysia’s authority in the\r\ninternational arena. I am confident that, under his able\r\nguidance, the General Assembly will write another\r\nexemplary chapter in the annals of United Nations history.\r\nI also take this opportunity to extend our deep\r\ngratitude to the President of the last, historic fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral, for the excellent manner in which he led the\r\nwork of the Assembly.\r\nThe Azerbaijani Republic attaches special\r\nimportance to the creation of a new world order, based\r\nprimarily on the strict observance by all States of the\r\nfundamental principles of international law and on the\r\ncomprehensive system of international security. World\r\nsecurity must take into consideration the interests of all\r\nsovereign States, irrespective of their size or population.\r\nNo single State should ensure its own security at the\r\nexpense of another.\r\nIn a transformed world in the late twentieth century,\r\nthe euphoria of post-bloc relations has begun to yield to\r\nthe sober realization that mankind is faced today with\r\nacute problems of an increasingly global nature. The\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, aggressive\r\nseparatism, international terrorism, drug trafficking and\r\nenvironmental pollution are common problems that must\r\nbe resolved through joint efforts. In these conditions, the\r\nconsolidated action of Member States will permit a\r\nquicker identification of the real mechanisms needed to\r\naddress these serious problems.\r\nAzerbaijan welcomes the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, recently opened\r\nfor signature. The objective achieved had been sought for\r\nmany decades. It is a major contribution to the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, in particular, and\r\ndisarmament in general.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nTaking into account the historical experience of the\r\nworld community and striving to attain the highest human\r\nvalues, the Government of Azerbaijan, in the person of\r\nPresident Heydar Aliyev, having unified the nation, is\r\nheading with determination along the path of democratic\r\nreform, since only a climate of peace and national accord\r\nbased on respect for civic rights and human liberties can\r\nensure the overall development of the individual and society\r\nand create conditions conducive to normal interaction with\r\nthe world at large and the country’s achievement of\r\ndemocratic political, economic and humanitarian standards.\r\nHowever, every aspect of life in my country has been\r\nseriously affected by the aggression of the Republic of\r\nArmenia. The occupation of about 20 per cent of the\r\nterritory of Azerbaijan and the seizure and plunder of towns\r\nand villages, including tens of thousands of objects taken\r\nfrom households, industry, agriculture, the infrastructure\r\nand the social sector, continue to inflict enormous damage\r\non the Azerbaijani State. “Ethnic cleansing” has been\r\ncarried out in the occupied territories. The country faces an\r\nextremely serious humanitarian situation. The number of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons has passed the one million\r\nmark, a figure that is catastrophic for a country with a total\r\npopulation of 7.5 million.\r\nStill, we continue to consider peaceful negotiations\r\nwithin the framework of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk process to be the\r\nonly way to settle the conflict. It was for that reason that\r\nAzerbaijan, despite the continuing occupation of its lands\r\nand the presence of enormous numbers of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, consented to the ceasefire which has\r\nlasted for more than two years.\r\nThe Republic of Armenia, endeavouring to consolidate\r\nthe gains from its past aggression, refuses to recognize\r\nAzerbaijan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and thereby\r\nentirely discredits one of the fundamental principles of\r\ninternational law as a basis for settlement. That refusal has\r\nbecome a major obstacle to the achievement of peace.\r\nI would like to reconfirm our clear compromise\r\nposition on the settlement, which envisages the assurance\r\nof unconditional and immediate implementation of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and OSCE decisions\r\nregarding the conflict. The package of our proposals to\r\nspeed up progress in the Minsk process towards the\r\nachievement of a comprehensive settlement consists of\r\nthese elements: the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all\r\noccupied territories of Azerbaijan, including the Shusha and\r\nLachin districts; the return of the Azerbaijani population to\r\ntheir previous places of residence, including the Nagorny-\r\nKarabakh region of Azerbaijan; ensuring equal security,\r\nmonitored by the OSCE forces, for the Armenian and\r\nAzerbaijani populations who have suffered as a result of\r\nthe armed conflict; and guarantees that autonomy will be\r\ngranted to the entire population of the region constituting\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nAt their meeting on 22 April 1996 in Luxembourg,\r\nheld within the framework of the conclusion of bilateral\r\nagreements on partnership and cooperation between\r\nAzerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia and the European\r\nUnion, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia adopted\r\na joint communiqué expressing their agreement that the\r\nresolution of the conflict will make a substantial\r\ncontribution to regional stability and security as well as to\r\nthe socio-economic development of the peoples of the\r\nregion.\r\nIn reflecting on the establishment of a security\r\nsystem at the regional and pan-European levels, we would\r\nlike to emphasize that in our view the forthcoming OSCE\r\nSummit in Lisbon constitutes a real opportunity for the\r\nelaboration of basic principles for the settlement, not only\r\nfor the settlement, not only of the Armenian-Azerbaijani\r\nconflict, but possibly also other conflicts in the OSCE\r\narea. The relevant provisions of the Summit’s final\r\ndocument, agreed at the highest level, could play a most\r\nimportant role in the positive development of negotiations\r\nboth within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other\r\ncurrent mediatory efforts of the OSCE.\r\nFor several years since the end of the cold war\r\nactive discussions have been taking place in the world on\r\nthe transformation of international relations. These\r\ndiscussions are held at different levels and touch upon\r\nalmost all aspects of life of the world community. The\r\nUnited Nations, as the leading international organization,\r\nis the main forum for gathering and testing a majority of\r\nideas related to a vision and understanding of processes\r\ntaking place in the world in recent years, and the\r\npossibilities for their implementation in the name of\r\nhuman progress.\r\nIn recent years these have been wide discussions on\r\nan increase in the membership of the Security Council or,\r\nin a broader context, on its reform in the light of the\r\nsubstantial increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations and the major changes in international relations.\r\nIn this regard, it is important to take into account the\r\nneed to maintain and even strengthen the ability of the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nSecurity Council to respond adequately to threats of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAzerbaijan supports the candidatures of Germany and\r\nJapan as potential permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil. At the same time, the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation of all regions among the permanent members\r\nshould not disappear from the agenda. In this context, it\r\nshould be noted that many other ideas and proposals have\r\nbeen put forward, in particular by Italy and a number of\r\nother States, which must be thoroughly studies.\r\nAzerbaijan fully supports the efforts undertaken by the\r\ninternational community in response to the alarming\r\nincrease in terrorist acts in recent years. We unequivocally\r\ncondemn, as criminal and unjustifiable, all acts, methods\r\nand practices of terrorism, wherever and by whomever they\r\nare committed, including those that jeopardize friendly\r\nrelations among States and peoples and threaten the\r\nterritorial integrity and security of States. Azerbaijan\r\nsupports the establishment of a specialized international\r\norganization to combat terrorism.\r\nAzerbaijan attaches crucial importance to the process\r\nof integration into the global economic system, and\r\nconsiders it one of the main requisites for the formation of\r\na multidimensional, dynamic market economy and an open\r\ndemocratic society. For this purpose legislation has been\r\nadopted to strengthen market economy principles, notably\r\nthrough laws on private property, free enterprise, banking\r\nactivities, foreign investment protection, and so on.\r\nEconomic reform in Azerbaijan and the implementation of\r\neconomic projects are being carried out in active\r\ncollaboration with the Bretton Woods institutions. Concrete\r\nmeasures have been worked out and are being implemented\r\nto shape State economic policy for the transitional period.\r\nThey include the reform of the monetary and credit system\r\nand the development of pricing and tax policies. A three-\r\nyear programme to privatize State enterprises has been\r\nlaunched. To achieve this goal Azerbaijan actively\r\nencourages foreign investment, and has embarked on a\r\nconsistent course of liberalization of foreign economic\r\nactivity, the gradual elimination of non-tariff restrictions,\r\nand encouragement of national exports.\r\nThe Azerbaijan Republic agrees on the need for the\r\nstructural reform and financial normalization of the United\r\nNations. In this regard, I would like once again to draw the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s attention to the problem of the\r\nassessment of fair contributions to the United Nations\r\nbudget that will reflect the real capacity of States to pay.\r\nWhile we welcome the decision of principle to abolish the\r\nsystem of limits, we nevertheless consider that the long-\r\nwindedness of this process is resulting in the deterioration\r\nof the financial situation of the newly independent States,\r\nincluding Azerbaijan, which is obliged, in order to clear\r\nits debts to the United Nations budget, to cut down on the\r\nalready very meagre programmes of social support for the\r\npopulation, particularly refugees and displaced persons.\r\nThe Government of Azerbaijan would also like to\r\ndraw particular attention to the need for fair\r\nrepresentation of the new independent States within the\r\nstaff of the United Nations. While we are aware of the\r\ndifficulties the Organization is now experiencing, we\r\ncannot accept a situation in which Azerbaijan is still not\r\nrepresented in the secretariats of the United Nations and\r\nits specialized agencies.\r\nThe economic reforms carried out in Azerbaijan are\r\naimed largely at improving the social situation of the\r\npopulation. However, the monthly income of a\r\nconsiderable portion of the population is below the\r\nsubsistence level, given the persisting economic\r\ndifficulties in a country with an economy in transition,\r\nwhich have been aggravated by the burden of providing\r\nthe necessary assistance to the refugees and displaced\r\npersons.\r\nIn such a situation, great importance attaches to\r\nspecial humanitarian and other forms of assistance from\r\nthe United Nations, its specialized agencies and donor\r\ncountries, including assistance for the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of a number of regions of Azerbaijan that\r\nhave suffered as a result of military action. While\r\nexpressing the deep gratitude of the people of Azerbaijan\r\nfor the assistance provided, we appeal to donor countries\r\nnot to reduce its scale.\r\nI am confident that the United Nations will continue\r\nto do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of\r\npeaceful coexistence among States, and to reinforce the\r\nnotion of the interdependence of national aspirations and\r\nthe common welfare of humanity, thus creating conditions\r\nconducive to the political stability and sustainable\r\neconomic development of States.\r\nThe potential exists to reinforce and strengthen the\r\nwork of the United Nations. We are increasingly\r\nwitnessing the expansion of the Organization’s sphere of\r\nactivity, when it goes beyond the bounds of the traditional\r\nconcept of maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and tackles more diversified tasks. Activities such\r\nas electoral assistance, the provision of special\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nhumanitarian assistance, human rights monitoring,\r\nassistance in nation-building and the creation of conditions\r\nfor the sustainable development of States have begun to be\r\nassociated around the world with the United Nations today.\r\nIn concluding, I should like to recall the well-known\r\nmaxim: “The best world is a world that belongs to all, and\r\nit becomes possible only through the efforts of all.” So let\r\nus unite our efforts for the sake of building such a world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of the Royal Government of\r\nCambodia, His Excellency Mr. Ung Huot.\r\nMr. Ung Huot (Cambodia)(interpretation from\r\nFrench): Allow me, at the outset, to warmly congratulate\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, on behalf of the\r\nCambodian delegation, on his election to the post of\r\nPresident of this Assembly. His election is a tribute to his\r\nprofessionalism, as well as to his country, Malaysia, with\r\nwhich Cambodia has traditionally entertained close and\r\ncordial relations. My delegation is convinced that with his\r\ncompetence and experience, Ambassador Ismail will guide\r\nour session with wisdom and perspicacity to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nMy delegation would also like to congratulate and\r\nthank His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal for his successful presidency of the General\r\nAssembly’s fiftieth session.\r\nI wish also to take this opportunity to express our deep\r\nappreciation to an individual to whom the Royal Kingdom\r\nof Cambodia owes profound gratitude for the role he has\r\nplayed in the peace process in our country — the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\r\nGhali — for his performance and sincere dedication in\r\naccomplishing this lofty mission.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe forthcoming 23 October will be the fifth\r\nanniversary of the signing of the Agreement on a\r\nComprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia\r\nConflict. The Royal Government and people of Cambodia\r\nwill mark this historic event with a nationwide celebration.\r\nThe Agreement was forged\r\n“to maintain, preserve and defend the sovereignty,\r\nindependence, territorial integrity and inviolability,\r\nneutrality and national unity of Cambodia” (Agreement\r\non a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the\r\nCambodia Conflict, DPI/1180-92077, p. 8, para. 3)\r\nthrough the restoration of peace and the promotion of\r\nnational reconciliation in the country. The Cambodian\r\npeople will always remember the sacrifices made by the\r\ninternational community on their behalf, especially those\r\neminent persons who dedicated themselves to the cause of\r\npeace and democracy in our country. We are indeed\r\nindebted to them all and remain deeply grateful for their\r\ncontinued contribution to the reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment of Cambodia, allowing it once more to take\r\nits proper place in the concert of nations.\r\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia, presided over\r\nby His Royal Highness Samdech Krom Preah Norodom\r\nRanariddh and His Excellency Samdech Hun Sen, was\r\nborn of a free and fair election organized and supervised\r\nby the United Nations in May 1993. It is now barely three\r\nyears old, but thanks to the determination of the\r\nCambodian people and the invaluable assistance and\r\nsupport given by this world body and its agencies, other\r\ninternational organizations and friendly countries, the\r\nrebuilding of Cambodia has proceeded apace.\r\nIn “An Agenda for Peace”, His Excellency the\r\nSecretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali spoke of the\r\nneed for the United Nations to give careful consideration\r\nto the requirements of post-conflict peace-building. As\r\ncan be seen from the Cambodian experience, this is a\r\ncomplex and multifaceted process. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Representative in Cambodia The Honourable\r\nBenny Widyono commented in a recent article that\r\n“post-conflict peace-building is not just a collection\r\nof disjointed activities. It requires a holistic concept\r\nencompassing political, institutional, legal, economic\r\nand social objectives.”\r\nThis holistic approach has also been very rapidly\r\nrecognized by the Royal Government. Nine months after\r\nthe general elections, it launched the National Programme\r\nfor the Rehabilitation and the Development of Cambodia,\r\nin February 1994. At the same time, it was able to ensure\r\npolitical stability, improve security and engineer a rapid\r\neconomic recovery, as reflected by a strong gross\r\ndomestic product growth of 7.6 per cent, an inflation rate\r\nkept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of the\r\nnational currency throughout 1995. These figures,\r\ncombined with a liberal investment law and a low gross\r\ndomestic product of $287 per capita, are providing strong\r\nincentives for foreign direct investment, in particular now\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nthat Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the\r\nUnited States, the European Union and other important\r\ncountries in the world. Soon Cambodia hopes to obtain\r\nGeneralized System of Preferences status.\r\nIn pursuing its aims of structural reforms and\r\ndevelopment while seeking to improve the quality of life of\r\nits citizens, the Royal Government is conscious of the need\r\nfor environmental protection. Cambodia has become a\r\nsignatory of the United Nations Convention on Biological\r\nDiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification in\r\nThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification. The Government is ever mindful of its\r\nresponsibility to protect Cambodia’s rich natural heritage,\r\nin the interests both of its people and of the world at large.\r\nTherefore, as stated by the First Prime Minister at the First\r\nConsultative Group Meeting, held last July in Tokyo, the\r\nRoyal Government is committed to implementing a\r\nsustainable and transparent forest policy in line with the\r\nrecommendations put forward in a joint study made by the\r\nWorld Bank, the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations (FAO).\r\nBeing profoundly conscious that development requires\r\nsecurity, problems linked with the Khmer Rouge have to be\r\naddressed through their reintegration into the national fold,\r\nand through the long-term policy of development of rural\r\nareas. Military operations near the northwestern border are\r\ndesigned to gradually reduce the nuisance they pose and to\r\nconvince them to join the national community. National\r\nunity remains the target of the Cambodian Government.\r\nThe recent massive breakaway of the core groups of the\r\nKhmer Rouge testifies to the correctness of the Royal\r\nGovernment’s approach.\r\nRecognizing that Cambodia’s tragic recent history\r\nrequires special measures to assure the protection of human\r\nrights and the non-return to the policies and practices of the\r\npast, the Royal Government has pursued an active policy to\r\nensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nfor all in Cambodia without discrimination as to race, sex\r\nor religion. In these efforts, it has received the technical\r\nassistance of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights,\r\nfor which the Royal Government is greatly appreciative. In\r\nparticular, Cambodia acknowledges the valued contribution\r\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nHuman Rights, Ambassador Thomas Hammarberg.\r\nMindful that human rights encompass political rights,\r\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia adopted a policy of liberal\r\ndemocracy and pluralism, as stated in article 51 of the\r\nConstitution of the Kingdom, in 1993. This includes the\r\nfree exercise of political choice. In respect of its solemn\r\ncommitment to the Constitution, the Royal Government\r\nis making preparations for the holding of local elections\r\nin 1997 and national elections in 1998. To this end, it\r\nwelcomes international technical and financial assistance,\r\nas well as international observers.\r\nThe achievements of the Royal Government in a\r\nshort period of time have given it the confidence to\r\npursue efforts towards the declared aims of building a\r\nState governed by the rule of law, a market system that\r\nsecures social benefits and ensuring the long term and\r\nsustainable development of the national economy within\r\nthe framework of regional integration. Hence, last April,\r\nCambodia submitted its official request for full\r\nmembership in the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) by July 1997, in the recognition that\r\nASEAN is the vehicle for peace, security, stability, shared\r\nopportunities and common prosperity in the region of\r\nSouth-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region at large.\r\nCambodia also takes note that the ASEAN Regional\r\nForum is an invaluable setting to discuss in a frank and\r\nfriendly manner security issues of common concern and\r\ninterest to all participants in the Forum, whether large or\r\nsmall countries around the world. The ASEAN Regional\r\nForum has in fact already provided a sense of mutual\r\nconfidence, as reflected in the comfort felt by all the\r\nsenior officials and high representatives of the\r\nparticipating countries. It can be viewed as a first step in\r\npreventive, quiet diplomacy, thereby paving the way for\r\nagreements on substantive issues in the coming years\r\nbased on the traditional consensus principle, which\r\ncharacterizes ASEAN.\r\nCambodia is particularly proud to be able to\r\nassociate itself with all the countries in the region and to\r\nsubstantially contribute to regional and world peace\r\nthrough the signing of the South-East Asia Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty on 15 December 1995. This\r\nmarks real progress towards the creation of a zone of\r\npeace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.\r\nThrough the review of the Protocol to the Treaty, it is our\r\nearnest hope that all nuclear-weapon States will accede to\r\nthe Treaty, in line with the aspirations of the peoples of\r\nSouth-East Asia for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in this\r\npart of the world.\r\nCambodia’s position on the question of nuclear\r\nweapons has been and remains that a complete prohibition\r\nof nuclear weapons and their destruction are basic to\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nworld peace. Thus, a complete test ban will lead towards\r\nthe ultimate objective of complete nuclear disarmament.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is proud to have been able to\r\nco-sponsor and sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty, considered a significant step towards promoting\r\nnuclear disarmament. This will be the greatest service that\r\nour generation can perform to free future generations from\r\nthe terrible prospect of a world holocaust.\r\nWhile we are addressing the issue of the CTBT and\r\nthe ban on weapons of mass destruction, we should not\r\noverlook the issue of landmines in various parts of the\r\nworld. Cambodia is the hardest hit nation in the world. The\r\nRoyal Government and the people of Cambodia pay great\r\ntribute to all the generous donor countries that have assisted\r\nus in our efforts to rid the country of the scourge of\r\nlandmines. But how many millions of these cold, cruel and\r\nsilent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent\r\ncivilian population in remote areas of the country near the\r\nwestern border? Banning them is an easy job. We need\r\ninternational support to fully eradicate them.\r\nIn his message to the Review Conference of the States\r\nParties to the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons last April, His Majesty Preah Bat Samdech Preah\r\nNorodom Sihanouk Varman, King of Cambodia, appealed\r\nto all countries and peoples, international organizations,\r\nStates and Governments to take, in a universal consensus,\r\nconcrete measures towards definitively outlawing, as soon\r\nas possible, the production, export, utilization and sale of\r\nmines.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is therefore gratified by\r\nthe recent Chairman’s statement for the Third ASEAN\r\nRegional Forum held last July in Jakarta. On the issue of\r\nthe global elimination of anti-personnel mines, the Forum\r\nwelcomed the decisions of several States to impose\r\nmoratoria and bans on the production, export and\r\noperational use of these weapons. It recognized the need,\r\nfollowing conflict, for reinforcing international support for\r\nefforts to detect and remove landmines and to assist\r\nvictims. Cambodia welcomes the initiatives of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany and of Canada in this General\r\nAssembly and gives its full support to the proposed\r\nresolutions.\r\nPermit me to inform you, Sir, and all distinguished\r\ndelegates that my country is presently facing severe floods\r\naffecting 1.3 million people, or one tenth of our population.\r\nOn behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia and on\r\nmy own behalf, I would like to sincerely and deeply thank\r\nthe friendly Governments that have immediately given\r\ngenerous humanitarian assistance to our afflicted people.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to our\r\nother friends to help relieve this blight.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia recognizes the need to\r\nfocus attention on such issues as the trafficking in\r\nnarcotics and other criminal behaviour, which transcend\r\nnational borders and which can so intimately affect the\r\nlives of each one of our citizens and undermine our social\r\nstructures. Such transnational issues do not appear\r\namenable to resolution other than by immediate ongoing\r\nmanagement through shared information and coordination.\r\nOf particularly urgent concern is the issue of drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is a victim of a rapid\r\nescalation in the traffic of drugs transiting through its\r\nterritory. Unfortunately, Cambodia at present lacks the\r\nappropriate legal, technical and financial means to deal\r\neffectively with this problem. It nevertheless affirms its\r\nstrong commitment to drug control through effective\r\ninternational cooperation. The Royal Government wishes\r\nsincerely to thank the United States of America for its\r\nstrong support under the United States-Cambodia\r\nAgreement to Counter Narcotics.\r\nCambodia is pleased with the decision taken by the\r\nThird ASEAN Regional Forum to consider at the next\r\nmeeting the question of drug trafficking and other related\r\ntransnational issues such as economic crimes, including\r\nmoney laundering, which could constitute threats to the\r\nsecurity of the countries of the region.\r\nThrough the good offices of the United Nations,\r\nmultilateral approaches to problems have provided useful\r\nsources of information and highlighted issues close to the\r\nhearts of many of our citizens. The past summit\r\nconferences in Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul\r\nhave contributed to the promotion of gender equality, and\r\nhave given recognition to the role of women and children,\r\nthe improvement of the quality of life through health care\r\nand adequate housing, respect for human rights, and\r\nprotection of the environment.\r\nA further vital, and perhaps fundamental, issue for\r\nthe attention of every member of the international\r\ncommunity must be that of the widening gap between rich\r\nand poor nations. This gap and its effects on the quality\r\nof life of the citizens of the developing world is directly\r\nrelated to the nature, organization and health of the world\r\neconomy. Vital decisions determining the shape and\r\nnature of the world economy are, however, well outside\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nthe control of a vast majority of nations, particularly those\r\nin the third world.\r\nSince the Non-Aligned Summit in Jakarta in 1992, no\r\nindications have been observed of a rapid and solid\r\nrecovery in the world economy. Instabilities spread more\r\nquickly from one country to another, particularly to\r\ndeveloping countries, which are now more vulnerable and\r\nsensitive to external factors. The continuing trend towards\r\na global economy, with the increasingly free flow of capital\r\nthroughout the world without reference to national borders,\r\nmeans that the ebbs and flows of the world economy have\r\nan almost immediate effect around the world. For many\r\npoorer nations, this has resulted in an increased national\r\ndebt burden with the consequence of greater instability in\r\nthe daily lives of their citizens.\r\nNotions of competition are not realistic for countries\r\nthat from the outset have a mammoth burden of debt,\r\nlimited access to technology, and populations ill-equipped\r\nto meet the challenges of the global economy. It is\r\nCambodia’s strong hope that through the United Nations we\r\ncan go a long way towards ameliorating this situation,\r\nwhich is already at a crisis point for many nations in the\r\nworld community.\r\nTherefore, the democratization of international\r\neconomic relations is essential to ensure that the\r\ndevelopment interests of developing countries will be taken\r\nfully into account. In this regard, it is also essential to place\r\ndevelopment cooperation at the centre of the United Nations\r\nmandate, role and functions. To do this, the United Nations\r\nitself needs to begin the process of reform so that it is\r\nbetter able to deal with the conditions of the new global\r\neconomy. The United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization should play a key role as focal\r\npoints of the United Nations system in the areas of trade\r\nand development of developing countries. UNCTAD, in\r\nparticular, needs to study trends and issues in the world\r\neconomy, especially those that have an impact on\r\ndeveloping countries, and propose policies and measures\r\nthat can address projected problems. For instance,\r\nGeneralized Special Preference (GSP) donors should\r\nsimplify and harmonize the rules of origin. By the same\r\ntoken, all political conditions attached to international trade,\r\ndevelopment assistance and investment should cease. They\r\nrepresent, in fact, a new wave of protectionism.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe delegation of Cambodia is deeply concerned at\r\nthe financial crisis in the United Nations today. With its\r\nmodest resources, Cambodia intends to meet its\r\nresponsibilities to do what it can to ease the financial\r\ncrisis. But if this Organization is to continue to exist true\r\nto the spirit of its Charter, an equitable and fair solution\r\nmust be found, taking into account the need for sweeping\r\nreform in United Nations structures which must reflect the\r\nrapid changes in various parts of the world that have\r\ntaken place since the end of the cold war.\r\nThe broad reforms and restructuring of the United\r\nNations must also extend to the Security Council to\r\nensure that its work is both democratic and more\r\neffective. In particular, Cambodia supports closer relations\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly\r\nthrough greater accountability of the Council to the\r\nAssembly. Priority must be given to reform in economic,\r\nsocial and other areas so as better to meet the challenges\r\nand take account of the economic priorities of developing\r\ncountries against the backdrop of globalization.\r\nAs one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement in 1956 in Brioni, Yugoslavia, Cambodia has\r\nconsistently worked to promote solidarity among\r\nMembers and cooperate in the search for lasting peace in\r\nthe world and economic development that goes hand in\r\nhand with social justice for all humankind.\r\nAs His Majesty the King emphasized in his message\r\non the thirty-fifth anniversary of its creation, the Non-\r\nAligned Movement is currently meeting challenges unlike\r\nthose that existed when it was established. Many lofty\r\naspirations for national independence and freedom have\r\nbecome fact, but as His Majesty said:\r\n“The majority of our members still have to deal with\r\nhuge problems caused by unemployment, poverty,\r\nfamine, drought, landmines, illiteracy, deforestation,\r\nracial discrimination and terrorism. We must\r\ntherefore try to reduce military expenditure and the\r\nproduction of landmines in order to devote our\r\nnational resources to the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of our peoples.”\r\nIn recent years, the world has seen several\r\ndevelopments regarding the strengthening of regional\r\nsecurity and political stability. First of all, the Kingdom\r\nof Cambodia wishes sincerely to welcome the\r\nestablishment of the Southern Philippines Council for\r\nPeace and Development and the peace process in\r\nMindanao. It fully supports the peace agreements\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nconcluded between the Government of the Philippines and\r\nthe Moro National Liberation Front on 2 September 1996.\r\nThese agreements will undoubtedly contribute to an end to\r\nthe conflict in the southern Philippines, bringing both\r\nlasting peace to Mindanao and prosperity and national\r\nharmony to the fraternal people of the Philippines.\r\nCambodia welcomes the Dayton Peace Agreement and\r\nthe signing on 14 December 1995 in Paris of the General\r\nFramework for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the\r\nFramework Agreement) between the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and other concerned parties.\r\nCambodia welcomes the announcement of the end of\r\nthe war in Chechnya, thereby ending the suffering of the\r\nwarring parties, and particularly the innocent civilian\r\npopulation.\r\nCambodia welcomes progress made since August 1995\r\nin the Middle East peace process, particularly the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Principles on Interim\r\nSelf-Government Arrangements between the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nInterim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of\r\n28 September 1995, the first Palestinian elections on 20\r\nJanuary 1996, as well as the beginning of negotiations on\r\nthe final status between the Palestinians and Israelis in Taba\r\nin May 1996. Cambodia calls for the continuation of the\r\npeace talks, bearing in mind the inalienable right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to an\r\nindependent State on its national territory with the support\r\nof the international community.\r\nMy country is deeply concerned at the recent situation\r\nin Afghanistan where war continues to bring death and\r\ndevastation. We hope that our Afghan brothers will be able\r\nto overcome their differences and will soon find the path to\r\ndialogue.\r\nWith regard to the situation on the Korean peninsula,\r\nCambodia supports the reunification efforts of the Korean\r\npeoples on the basis of the principles set forth in the Joint\r\nDeclaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of\r\n4 July 1972 and the accord of February 1992. We also\r\nwelcome initiatives to formulate a definitive peace\r\nagreement promoting solid peace and security on the\r\npeninsula.\r\nIn respect of Africa, the Royal Government of\r\nCambodia welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly\r\nof resolution 49/142. We are aware of the tremendous\r\ndifficulties facing African States in bringing development\r\nand prosperity to their respective peoples. Cambodia calls\r\nfor the speedy implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and\r\nthe consolidation of efforts to diversify the African\r\neconomy. We hope that with the helping hand of the\r\ninternational community, particularly the donor countries,\r\nthis great continent will profit from the opportunities\r\navailable to it and join in the efforts to achieve\r\nsustainable development, a major challenge facing all the\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and External Trade of the Comoros, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Omar Said Ahmed.\r\nMr. Ahmed (Comoros) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Allow me at the outset to address to the\r\nPresident the sincere congratulations of the delegation of\r\nthe Comoros on his brilliant election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. My\r\ncountry, the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, is\r\ndelighted by his election because, in our eyes, it is a\r\nunanimous tribute from the international community to his\r\ngreat, friendly country, Malaysia, with which the\r\nComoros maintains excellent relations of cooperation and\r\nfriendship. This choice is also a tribute to his personal\r\nqualifications as a veteran diplomat respected by all.\r\nI also take this opportunity to convey our profound\r\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral\r\nof Portugal, for the devotion and skill with which he\r\nconducted the work of the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nTo Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, that intrepid artisan of the lofty ideals of peace,\r\nsolidarity and justice, I should like to pay a well-deserved\r\ntribute for the efforts that he continuously makes for the\r\nbenefit of our world Organization.\r\nMy country adheres entirely to the Yaoundé\r\nDeclaration adopted by the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment at the thirty-second session of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which recommends\r\nthe candidature of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a\r\nsecond term.\r\nLast year, the United Nations commemorated with\r\nfanfare its fiftieth anniversary. More than 129 Heads of\r\nState and Government solemnly reaffirmed the ideals of\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nthe maintenance of peace, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and the strengthening of international cooperation\r\nand development. In the Declaration adopted at that\r\ncommemorative meeting, the indispensable role of the\r\nUnited Nations was recognized by all. That is why the\r\nsovereign leaders of the world also called for the United\r\nNations to be reformed and attuned to the requirements of\r\nmodern times.\r\nAn objective analysis has made it possible to see that\r\nthe structure of the Organization no longer corresponds to\r\nthe realities of today’s world, which is changing at the\r\neconomic, political and geographic levels. At a time of\r\nglobalization, when science and technology are\r\nrevolutionizing communications, the interdependence of\r\nnations is emerging as an incontrovertible fact, and\r\ndemocracy is the only path of salvation for the peoples of\r\nthe world, our Organization simply cannot and should not\r\nkeep a body reserved exclusively to certain States on a\r\npermanent basis while the great majority has only\r\ntemporary access to it.\r\nIn other words, Security Council reform is urgent and\r\nimperative if we are to act in accordance with the principle\r\nof the sovereign equality of States. In that connection, the\r\nItalian proposal for the reform of the Security Council\r\noffers specific advantages in terms of the possibility of\r\naccess to the Council for small and medium-sized States.\r\nNo one denies the considerable role of the United\r\nNations in the establishment of a global society that is more\r\njust and peaceful and better integrated. But everyone\r\nremembers the historic conditions of its creation. The end\r\nof the cold war, the elaboration of a number of conventions\r\nand treaties on disarmament and the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction are, in our view, moral values\r\nthat guarantee the emergence of a world of peace in which\r\nthe right to life and well-being will win out over barbarism\r\nand brute force.\r\nAt the dawn of the third millennium, the United\r\nNations represents the only recourse for the emancipation\r\nof peoples and the eradication of poverty. In this\r\nconnection, we must emphasize the considerable work done\r\nby the Organization’s specialized agencies to help States\r\nrequiring assistance in their daily struggle against\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nThere is no need to recall that, in the past five years,\r\nour Organization has initiated and organized a number of\r\nthematic conferences aimed at identifying solutions capable\r\nof inspiring States in their national policy-making. These\r\ninclude the New York World Summit for Children, the\r\nRio Conference on Environment and Development, the\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights, the Cairo\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\r\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development,\r\nthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women and,\r\nmore recently, the United Nations Conference on Human\r\nSettlements (Habitat II) at Istanbul. We are also entitled\r\nto hope that next November’s Rome World Food Summit\r\nwill offer effective guidance in this vital area.\r\nThe founding fathers of our Organization, recalling\r\nthe horrors and atrocities of the Second World War,\r\nbequeathed to us an instrument that grants primacy to law\r\nand dialogue. Unfortunately, other modern scourges, such\r\nas genocide, ethnic cleansing, occupation and civil war\r\nhave continued to raise the clamour of weapons within\r\nStates.\r\nThe victims of these new wars are the same as those\r\nof yesterday’s — women, children and the elderly.\r\nThe resurgence of violence in the Middle East in the\r\npast few days, arising from the many provocations\r\norchestrated by the new Israeli authorities, throws into the\r\nquestion the peace process, which recognizes the\r\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign\r\nand independent State.\r\nFor my country, the resumption of the peace process\r\nnecessarily involves a withdrawal of Israeli troops from\r\noccupied territories of the Golan and southern Lebanon.\r\nThe closing of the tunnel under the Al-Aqsa Mosque is a\r\nsine qua non for reducing tensions and halting the\r\nviolence. During the past 30 years of warfare in the\r\nMiddle East, the victims have been and remain the\r\ncivilian populations. No one can forget the Gulf war or its\r\nconsequences for all parties concerned.\r\nMy country urges Iraq to seek a solution that would\r\nensure the peace and security of its neighbours and\r\ninclude respect for the independence and territorial\r\nintegrity of Kuwait. In this connection, the question of\r\nKuwaiti prisoners detained by Iraq is a concern, the\r\nsettlement of which would send a signal of willingness\r\nfor appeasement.\r\nThe illegal occupation of the islands of Tunb and\r\nAbu Musa by Iran is also a source of tension in that part\r\nof the world. The United Arab Emirates is sparing no\r\neffort to recover peacefully that integral part of its\r\nterritory.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nThe embargoes imposed on the Libyan and Iraqi\r\npeoples are of concern to my country. Our Organization\r\nmust seek ways and means to enable the parties concerned\r\nto begin a dialogue aimed at a solution that would alleviate\r\nthe suffering of the civilian populations of these countries.\r\nThe advent of a democratic and multiracial South\r\nAfrica and the peace restored to Angola and Mozambique\r\nshould not make us overlook the fact that the African\r\ncontinent is still a theatre of conflict. Like the international\r\ncommunity, my country remains concerned over the\r\ndeterioration of the situation and the persistence of violence\r\nin Burundi. Only a return to constitutional order and to\r\nrepublican legality can reduce tensions and foster a dialogue\r\nbetween all the people of Burundi. We encourage President\r\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere in his mediation efforts aimed at\r\na peaceful solution.\r\nThe recent Abuja Agreement on Liberia offers a\r\nglimmer of hope for peace, provided that all the factions\r\nobserve the current ceasefire and participate in the\r\ndisarmament and demobilization of troops.\r\nThe Government of Sierra Leone and the\r\nRevolutionary United Front have made a commitment to\r\nnegotiation in order to put an end to the tragic fratricidal\r\nwar in that country. We can only encourage such initiatives\r\nand commend Côte d’Ivoire for its mediation.\r\nThe situation in Somalia warrants special attention. It\r\ndemonstrates the inability of the international community to\r\nfind a viable solution to the Somali tragedy.\r\nThe question of Western Sahara also requires in-depth\r\nconsideration on the part of our Organization, because this\r\nquestion involves safeguarding the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of a State Member of our Organization, the\r\nKingdom of Morocco.\r\nFortunately, other conflicts are coming to an end.\r\nThus, the recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina mark\r\na decisive new stage in the consolidation of peace and\r\nsecurity — the only condition that would make national\r\nreconstruction possible in that country long devastated by\r\nwar.\r\nThe world has become a global village fraught with\r\ninequality for its inhabitants. Indeed, the new world\r\neconomic order and development strategies have not\r\nbridged the gap separating the rich and poor countries. The\r\nmid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s has made it possible to\r\nnote that the Agenda has not had the desired impact on\r\ndevelopment, despite its harmonized priorities and\r\nobjectives. But we dare to hope that the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa, which\r\ncomplements the New Agenda, will stimulate the process\r\nand accelerate the integration of Africa into the\r\ninternational trading system. For now, small States can\r\nonly expect a continued drop in the prices of their raw\r\nmaterials and an increasingly unbearable debt burden.\r\nThe Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, a\r\nsmall island State that is among the least developed, is\r\none of those excluded from international trade because, in\r\naddition to its limited natural resources and the high cost\r\nof international transport, other political and structural\r\nconstraints have been brought to bear that bridle its socio-\r\neconomic development.\r\nThe recent history of my country has been\r\ncharacterized by a series of tragedies. The Assembly will\r\ncertainly recall the dramatic events of September 1995 in\r\nthe wake of the invasion of the country by mercenaries.\r\nThis aroused the indignation of the international\r\ncommunity and brought true economic and social disaster\r\nto my country. The people of the Comoros have suffered\r\ntoo deeply from repeated attempts at destabilization\r\nfomented from abroad. We appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to ensure that such practices — which belong\r\nto another era — come to an end throughout the world.\r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate our profound\r\ngratitude to France, whose military intervention, requested\r\nby the Government of the Comoros in accordance with\r\nthe defence agreements between our two countries, made\r\nit possible to rout the mercenaries. In the same context,\r\nI am pleased to pay a vibrant tribute to the Organization\r\nof African Unity for the decisive role it played in\r\nrestoring constitutional order.\r\nWe also extend our gratitude to the United Nations\r\nand all those who, near or far, contributed to the\r\norganization of the first free, democratic and transparent\r\nelections, which brought President Mohamed Taki\r\nAbdoulkarim to the highest office of my country.\r\nThis short overview of conditions in the Comoros\r\ndemonstrates the extent to which the newly elected Head\r\nof State has inherited a catastrophic situation,\r\ncharacterized by an exorbitant external debt, an empty\r\nState treasury and months of unpaid salaries for\r\ngovernment officials.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nYet, strengthened by his popular legitimacy and the\r\nsupport of a broad majority of the people of the Comoros,\r\nin six months President Taki drafted the broad outlines of\r\npolitical, economic and social reforms to overcome the\r\nnumerous obstacles impeding the construction of a\r\ndemocratic, prosperous and interdependent society in the\r\nComoros. A vast programme was set up in the economic\r\nand financial sphere that included financial stabilization\r\nmeasures, a State audit, monitoring of civil servants and a\r\nrecovery of State movable property and real estate. The\r\nresults are promising and, for the first time, there are cases\r\nof corruption and embezzlement of government funds\r\nbefore the Comorian justice system.\r\nIn this series of reforms, the private sector has pride\r\nof place. That is why the Government is disengaging itself\r\nfrom the monopoly it has enjoyed in many sectors which it\r\nhas turned over to dynamic privatization that generates\r\ngrowth.\r\nOfficial contacts have been opened with financial\r\ninstitutions and development partners of the Comoros in\r\norder to establish a structural adjustment programme with\r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to\r\nrestore my country’s credibility.\r\nIn the social sphere, ministerial departments — inter\r\nalia, those of national education and public health — have\r\nmobilized their energies to rehabilitate these very sensitive\r\nand vital sectors. An international conference on education\r\nin the Comoros is planned for next December and we invite\r\nall friendly countries, international and regional bodies to\r\nparticipate in that important meeting, aimed at mobilizing\r\nthe necessary resources to finance education that meets the\r\nexpectations of Comorian youth.\r\nIn the political and institutional sectors, the incredible\r\nproliferation of small political parties and a jury-rigged\r\nConstitution that is ineffective and difficult to implement\r\nhave seriously hampered the new democratic process. Thus,\r\nthe new presidential majority, comprised of more than 18\r\npolitical parties out of the 25 that have been officially\r\nrecognized, has merged into one great national political\r\nmovement. A consultative commission comprised of all the\r\nactive forces within the nation — political parties, trade\r\nunions and human rights and environmental associations —\r\nhas been working to amend the Constitution. Their draft\r\nwill be submitted for approval this month to the Comorian\r\npeople in a referendum. As soon as it is adopted, legislative\r\nand regional elections will be held to set up a parliament\r\nfor the country and municipal institutions for the regions.\r\nAfter 2l years of independence, the Comoros are still\r\nbeing built. President Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim is\r\naware of what is at stake. He knows that we must first\r\nrely on our own efforts, but he also knows that he may\r\nrely on the effective support of the international\r\ncommunity, especially the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies, including the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, the World Health Organization and the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, to which\r\nwe reiterate our complete confidence and deep gratitude\r\nfor their efforts towards the development of the Comoros.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I solemnly appeal to the\r\ninternational community to give special economic\r\nassistance to the Federal Islamic Republic of the\r\nComoros.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without mentioning\r\nthe question of the Comorian island of Mayotte, which is\r\non the fifty-first session’s agenda as a separate item. At\r\nthe appropriate time, I will not fail to detail developments\r\nand to express our hope of a settlement in the wake of the\r\ndemocratic changes that have occurred in the Comoros in\r\nthe past six months.\r\nThe end of the twentieth century challenges our\r\ncollective conscience to build a better world for future\r\ngenerations — a world without war and without poverty,\r\na world in which injustice, violence, drugs, terrorism and\r\nfundamentalism will no longer exist. Of course, one might\r\nsay that such a world is impossible because profit-\r\nseeking, protectionism and intolerance are obstacles to\r\nprogress and hindrances to the well-being of humanity.\r\nBut progress in science, technology and medicine\r\nreinforces our optimism.\r\nIt is in this spirit that our faith is revived in a United\r\nNations that is more dynamic and more democratic, a\r\nUnited Nations in which the rule of numbers will carry as\r\nmuch weight as the rule of strength.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Chairman of the delegation of Palau,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. David Orrukem.\r\nMr. Orrukem (Palau): It is my distinct honour to\r\naddress the United Nations during this historic session,\r\nwhich I am confident will be remembered for all time for\r\nits adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nThe Republic of Palau applauds and thanks those\r\ncountries that will be signatories to the Treaty, for we\r\nbelieve that it does much to advance our goal of ridding the\r\nplanet of nuclear weapons. The Treaty, by banning further\r\ntesting, will help prevent the development of more\r\ndangerous nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the Treaty will\r\nhelp prevent other nations from obtaining existing nuclear\r\nweapons. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty thus\r\nclearly helps to make the world a safer place for us and for\r\nall of our children.\r\nThe Republic of Palau’s commitment against the\r\ncreation and proliferation of nuclear weapons is long-lasting\r\nand resolute. When the people of Palau adopted our\r\nConstitution in 1978, we became the first country in the\r\nworld to become a constitutionally mandated nuclear-free\r\ncountry. Indeed, protecting our citizens from these horrific\r\nweapons of destruction is at the very heart and soul of our\r\nConstitution.\r\nWhile not every country will sign the Treaty, the fact\r\nthat the world’s five recognized nuclear Powers — the\r\nUnited States, China, France, Russia and the United\r\nKingdom — have agreed to abide by the terms of the\r\nTreaty and that the overwhelming majority of other nations,\r\nincluding the Republic of Palau, have also agreed to abide\r\nby its terms gives the citizens of my country and of every\r\nother nation on Earth the hope that one day we will be free\r\nfrom these catastrophic weapons of destruction and of the\r\nthreat they pose to each of us and to our global\r\nenvironment.\r\nAccordingly, I would like to thank all of those who\r\nhelped bring the citizens of the world this Treaty, including\r\nthe Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test\r\nBan, Ambassador Ramaker of the Netherlands, and\r\nespecially our close neighbour and great friend, the\r\nGovernment of Australia, which took the lead at the United\r\nNations in making this Treaty a reality.\r\nAnother of my nation’s primary concerns is the issue\r\nof how to protect the environment while providing\r\nsustainable economic development. This is a central issue\r\nfor small island nations in particular and for other\r\ndeveloping countries around the world. The Republic of\r\nPalau is therefore very pleased by the recognition and\r\naffirmation that human beings are at the centre of\r\nsustainable development and that they have the right to a\r\nhealthy, productive and meaningful life in harmony with\r\nnature.\r\nHowever, to make sure that this affirmation becomes\r\na reality, action must be taken at all levels of government,\r\nin particular at the international level. To help every\r\nnation achieve this goal, developing countries, including\r\nsmall island nations, must be provided the necessary\r\nresources to enable them to implement the decisions and\r\nrecommendations of the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, the Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates and other significant international conferences.\r\nThe Republic of Palau, a small island nation in the\r\nPacific, cherishes its recognition as an independent\r\ncountry and greatly values its membership in the United\r\nNations, which allows our voice to be heard on global\r\nissues such as the importance of freeing the world of\r\nnuclear weapons and protecting our global environment.\r\nWe believe that perhaps the most critically important role\r\nof the United Nations is to provide a forum for nations\r\nlarge and small to discuss, debate and reach agreement on\r\nhow best to serve economic, social, cultural and other\r\nhumanitarian problems. Consequently, we believe that\r\nthose countries which have made demonstrated efforts to\r\nadvance regional and global peace, security and prosperity\r\nby establishing partnerships with other countries to further\r\nthese causes have much to offer the United Nations as a\r\nwhole and to its constituent Members individually.\r\nIn his inaugural speech to his country, United States\r\nPresident Bill Clinton pointed out that it is very likely\r\nthat every problem we face has already been solved\r\nsomewhere in the world. The challenge for us all is to\r\ncommunicate with each other so that we can discover\r\nthose solutions. The United Nations clearly provides the\r\nforum for such dialogue and discovery to take place. The\r\nRepublic of Palau believes that a greater number of\r\nvoices invited to participate in these discussions can only\r\nlead to better solutions to the myriad global problems we\r\nall face.\r\nThe overwhelming support given to the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty aptly\r\ndemonstrates that, through many people working together,\r\nthe cacophony of historically divergent voices can be\r\nharmonized for the benefit of all the peoples of all the\r\nnations on Earth.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister of State and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Gabon, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Casimir Oye Mba.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nMr. Oye Mba (Gabon) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Gabon, it is an honour and\r\na pleasure for me to address this eminent gathering.\r\nLike previous speakers, I wish to recall that this\r\nmeeting is being held just one year after the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. On that occasion, the balance sheet of our\r\nactivities was examined many times. Fortunately, we are all\r\nagreed that we must seek together to find solutions to the\r\nmajor problems of the world, thereby preventing the\r\noutbreak of conflicts by establishing effective tools for\r\nnegotiation and cooperation.\r\nFor all of us who participate and who believe in it, the\r\nUnited Nations is a valuable tool in the service of a\r\ncommon ideal. This has been reflected in some positive\r\nachievements achieved through pragmatism. The essential\r\nlesson to draw from our assessments is that, while it has\r\nnot yet been able to meet all the challenges before it, the\r\nUnited Nations has nonetheless remained worthy of our\r\nhopes.\r\nThat is why delegations from nearly all nations\r\nannually take the opportunity offered by the regular session\r\nof the General Assembly to review the major concerns of\r\nthe moment and to devise new goals.\r\nBut before touching on that subject, I wish to convey\r\nto Mr. Razali the sincere and warm congratulations of the\r\ndelegation of Gabon on his brilliant election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nIt is a tribute to his country, Malaysia, and a recognition of\r\nhis great personal qualities. He has our best wishes for\r\nsuccess as he guides our proceedings.\r\nI would also like to express our thanks and affection\r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs of Portugal, for the manner in which he\r\ncarried out his term of office at the fiftieth session.\r\nTo Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I\r\nreaffirm here the support of the Government of Gabon for\r\nall his work on the tasks of our Organization and for the\r\ncompetence and authority he has demonstrated in carrying\r\nout his mandate, which have coincided with the formulation\r\nof United Nations reform measures. He is a worthy son of\r\nAfrica who has done honour to our Organization. As all\r\nmember States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nstated at the July 1996 Summit in Yaoundé, Gabon hopes\r\nthat he will continue his work.\r\nBuilding lasting and orderly peace based on the\r\nsincere and active cooperation of sovereign nations is one\r\nof the major missions of the United Nations. In our\r\ninterdependent yet fragmented and multipolar world, the\r\nUnited Nations must play a more assertive role,\r\nparticularly in the emergence of a new political and\r\neconomic international order. It must help us to redress\r\nthe general imbalance that has gripped the world since the\r\nend of the 1980s.\r\nThe sovereign equality of all States is among the\r\nmain principles of our community of nations.\r\nAccordingly, we must cultivate flexible and dynamic\r\nthought that transcends relations of power and allows our\r\nOrganization to achieve its goal of universality. This is\r\nthe approach one must follow with regard to United\r\nNations reform. Many countries have made contributions\r\nand many initiatives have been taken, as can be seen in\r\nthe reports of the working groups established for that\r\npurpose. Gabon is gratified.\r\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nEl Hadj Omar Bongo, President of the Gabonese\r\nRepublic, stated:\r\n“The Security Council ... should be reformed in\r\norder to embrace the present dimensions of our\r\nOrganization”. (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 36th\r\nmeeting, p. 15)\r\nRestructuring the United Nations, we believe, should\r\nalso include sweeping reform of its various subsidiary\r\nbodies, with a view to avoiding duplication in its\r\nfunctioning and programmes.\r\nTo sum up Gabon’s position, we would like to say\r\nthree things. First, it seems desirable and possible that the\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council could be\r\nincreased without that body’s becoming unwieldy.\r\nSecondly, and on this assumption, Africa should at least\r\nhave one permanent seat. Thirdly, that permanent seat\r\nshould be rotated among all African countries according\r\nto modalities to be defined later.\r\nThe complexity of this reform and its many political,\r\neconomic and financial implications should not prevent us\r\nfrom laying out the configuration of international relations\r\nin the twenty-first century. Since a considerable number\r\nof Security Council decisions affect Africa, that region\r\nmust not remain unrepresented on the Council, a body of\r\nparamount importance for the maintenance of\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\ninternational peace and security. In the context of reform,\r\nGabon subscribes to the objectives of rationalization and the\r\nclustering of activities whenever this enhances the\r\neffectiveness of the work of the United Nations.\r\nWe must attach priority importance to the\r\nestablishment of a reformed international system that can\r\npreserve the world from murderous conflicts that disrupt the\r\neconomies of the warring countries — a system that can\r\nfight underdevelopment, preserve the environment and wage\r\na worldwide combat against pandemics such as AIDS and\r\nmalaria — in other words, an international system that can\r\nbreak down the barriers to harmony and development in a\r\nrichly diverse world. It is certainly a daunting task, but only\r\nthrough these efforts and under these conditions can our\r\nOrganization secure lasting peace in the world.\r\nAlso high on the agenda is the resolution of problems\r\nrelating to development and to social progress in a climate\r\nof peace, with full respect for fundamental human rights.\r\nThroughout the years differences of opinion have arisen\r\nwith respect to these issues — particularly on how to\r\nresolve them. But given their decisive importance for our\r\nfuture and that of the United Nations, the international\r\ncommunity must mobilize to act on them.\r\nMore generally speaking, the time has come for us to\r\nwork together to restore to the United Nations its political\r\ndynamism and the means it still lacks. Clearly, then, we\r\nhave a great deal to think about.\r\nI should like now to touch on some matters of\r\nconcern, such as peace and development — values and\r\nhopes that are shared by all.\r\nDialogue is a prerequisite for — though not a\r\nguarantee of — achieving peace, which is indispensable for\r\nhuman society to develop and flourish. I refer not only to\r\nthe civilized dialogue of diplomatic relations — which, of\r\ncourse, is essential, but rather to a dialogue that could give\r\nrise to a culture — the culture of peace. Indeed, when\r\neverything is based on violence, dialogue is impossible. As\r\nBoris Pasternak wrote, “One cannot win others over by\r\nviolence”.\r\nThe Bantu people value dialogue. On the occasion of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the President\r\nof Gabon, from this very rostrum, stated:\r\n“I wish to propose that a real dialogue, a\r\npermanent dialogue, be established, under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations, between Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the South and those of the North. In\r\nthat way, we may be able to find solutions to our\r\ncommon problems.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 36th\r\nmeeting, p. 16)\r\nIf each State were to refrain from attempting to\r\nimpose its views on others, whatever the cost, and agreed\r\nthat meeting the needs of peoples in a diverse and\r\ninterdependent world requires dialogue and solidarity,\r\nthen lasting peace and development can be achieved. That\r\nis why we must usher in a new era, the era of\r\ndialogue — genuine, honest and constructive dialogue.\r\nWe must continue to work together on an equal\r\nfooting, with respect for humankind’s interests and values.\r\nWe must denounce and put an end to political violence,\r\neconomic marginalization and social injustice. Dialogue\r\nmust begin again: in Africa, in the Great Lakes region, in\r\nLiberia and Somalia; but also in the Middle East, in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, in Cyprus and in Chechnya —\r\nwherever it may be necessary.\r\nGabon is contributing, and will always contribute, to\r\nbuilding the vast edifice of peace. Our duty, indeed our\r\ninterest — in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations — lies in undertaking this\r\ntask. History has taught us that no country can hope to\r\nremain an island of peace in a sea of poverty, tension and\r\nwar.\r\nI believe that it is imperative to enhance the\r\nmodalities of action available to the United Nations in the\r\nfield of preventive diplomacy. In this connection, we must\r\nexplore further proposals to equip the Secretariat with an\r\nEarly Warning System aimed at preventing conflicts from\r\nerupting.\r\nOur faith in dialogue and our relentless pursuit of\r\npeace are the reasons why Gabon, whenever asked, has\r\nalways agreed to engage in mediation to resolve domestic\r\nconflicts in neighbouring countries, with the particular\r\ngoal of paving the way for a lasting peace.\r\nIn January 1996 Gabon hosted a round table aimed\r\nat inter-Chadian reconciliation. In March 1996 we also\r\nenabled our Angolan brothers to strengthen the\r\nfoundations for their future understanding, in the presence\r\nof several international observers. In both cases, the goal\r\nwas to settle differences and clear up misunderstandings.\r\nWhat was important for Gabon and its President was to\r\nbreak through the wall of mistrust that barred the way to\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nreaching sincere and lasting agreements on solutions to such\r\ncrises.\r\nWe cannot claim victory. The peace process in most\r\ncountries is lengthy, and reversals, which can delay or\r\njeopardize its conclusion, are frequent. For this reason, the\r\ninternational community must encourage and support those\r\nbrothers at war who have opted for the path of dialogue to\r\nbuild peace. It must also promote goodwill, which will\r\nenable the warring parties to resolve their conflicts. Africa\r\nprovides numerous examples of this.\r\nThe peace we seek requires not only dialogue but also\r\nother, sound initiatives such as disarmament and\r\ndenuclearization. In this connection, we welcome the\r\nindefinite extension last year of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Likewise, we are proud\r\nof the fact that in March 1996, the African countries signed\r\nin Cairo the Pelindaba Text of the African Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty on the denuclearization of our\r\ncontinent. Finally, we warmly welcome the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption, on 10 September 1996, of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. I signed it\r\nyesterday on behalf of my country.\r\nThe Central African States have decided to harmonize\r\ntheir policies on conventional disarmament, with a view to\r\nestablishing a register of conventional arms. The success of\r\nthis subregional undertaking will depend not only on the\r\nwill of the States of the subregion, but also on the political\r\nsupport and assistance of all States Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nPeace is also the result of confidence-building\r\nmeasures. The adoption of binding legal instruments and\r\nthe effective use of preventive diplomacy will allow Africa\r\nto be exorcised of the spectre of death-dealing conflicts.\r\nThe United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on\r\nSecurity Questions in Central Africa is working towards\r\nthat end. It just passed an important test with the solemn\r\nsignature, on 8 July 1996, of a non-aggression pact during\r\nthe thirty-second ordinary session of the Assembly of\r\nHeads of State and Government of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU). This important preventive diplomacy\r\nmeasure shows that the Governments of the Central African\r\ncountries intend to give pride of place to dialogue in the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes among them.\r\nThe signing of this pact by the Heads of State of the\r\nsubregion proves the importance and priority that the\r\ncountries of Central Africa accord to the Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa. The\r\nGovernment of Gabon thanks the General Assembly for\r\nsupporting that machinery through a trust fund, which\r\ngenerous donors, such as Japan, are beginning to pay into.\r\nIn 1974, during the special session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly, President Bongo, using an\r\nexample from nature, and according to a Gabonese\r\nmaxim, stated that:\r\n“When all the animals have been fed, calm reigns\r\nover the plains. (...) When the peoples of the earth\r\nhave the vital minimum and maximum of dignity to\r\nwhich they are entitled, peace and harmony will\r\nfinally have some likelihood of reigning on earth.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, sixth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, 2210th\r\nPlenary Meeting, para. 30)\r\nDevelopment is certainly essential to peace. I would\r\neven go as far as to say that it is an intrinsic element of\r\npeace.\r\nAlthough Africa has been wrestling with serious\r\neconomic, social and political problems for over two\r\ndecades, it is safe to say that henceforth it will vigorously\r\nand courageously undertake the reforms needed for its\r\nrecovery.\r\nHowever, African countries can make progress in\r\nthis direction only if they are given adequate support by\r\nthe international community, and by the developed\r\ncountries in particular.\r\nThe goals of sustained economic growth, social\r\ndevelopment, environmental protection and respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans\r\nof action of several international conferences have\r\nsustainable development as their common denominator.\r\nWe are witnessing an era of radical change\r\ncomparable to the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The globalization of the economy and of\r\ninformation and communications is changing relations\r\namong nations and increasing interdependence.\r\nWhile these trends inspire great hope, they also raise\r\nnumerous concerns because the impact of globalization\r\nvaries from country to country. Those in Africa, in\r\nparticular, where most come under the category of least\r\ndeveloped countries, are facing a worrisome economic\r\nsituation. Despite declarations and programmes of action,\r\nresources are not forthcoming.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nInternational economic and financial relations are\r\nchanging radically and quickly, as is clear from the events\r\nof recent years. The establishment of the International\r\nSeabed Authority which is well under way and which we\r\nwelcome; the creation of the World Trade Organization in\r\n1995, which is accelerating the easing of restrictions on free\r\ntrade and its globalization; and the gradual establishment of\r\nlarge regional blocs in various parts of the world are all\r\nfeatures of the new international order.\r\nThis situation, which is conducive to the emergence or\r\nconsolidation of poles of integration, is far, on every score,\r\nfrom benefitting African States, whose income, which\r\nderives essentially from basic commodities, remains\r\nvulnerable to price fluctuations on the international market\r\nthat are out of their control.\r\nIn addition, our continent’s heavy debt burden means\r\nthat our region is responsible for the greatest volume of\r\nreverse financial transfers due to debt repayment.\r\nStructural adjustment programmes, although beneficial,\r\nmean that populations have to make enormous sacrifices.\r\nThese programmes are now being followed in countries\r\nundergoing political reorganization. Because of the way\r\ndemocracy works, it is assumed that citizens support the\r\nproposed programmes. Inevitably, this increases the\r\ndemands made by society. For Governments, it is truly\r\ndifficult to find a balance between these contradictory\r\nrequirements.\r\nOf course, to remain credible partners we must abide\r\nby the requirements that go along with structural adjustment\r\nand the recovery of our economies. But we are duty-bound\r\nto include social needs when formulating and implementing\r\nreforms. The adoption of measures to promote sustained\r\neconomic growth should not distract us from financing\r\nbasic social and economic infrastructures such as roads,\r\nschools, hospitals, vocational training centres and so on.\r\nThis financing is essential if we are to improve our\r\npopulations’ living conditions and quality of life. As\r\nrepresentatives know, the United Nations remains sensitive\r\nto this approach. Encouragement is needed, however, to\r\nensure that this feeling is shared by its various agencies.\r\nGovernments have been called on to include poverty-\r\neradication strategies in general, people-oriented\r\ndevelopment policies. How do we do this?\r\nIn establishing a favourable economic environment,\r\nthe international community must support the efforts of all\r\ncountries that are willing to take this course of action. As\r\n1996 marks the beginning of the United Nations Decade\r\nfor the Eradication of Poverty, common objectives and\r\nthe commitments entered into in the framework of\r\noverseas development assistance must now become\r\nreality.\r\nHowever, since 1991, this assistance has declined in\r\nreal terms. Private capital flows have been exclusively\r\nfocused in some 20 developing countries. So far, there\r\nhas been no upsurge in private investment in countries of\r\nthe African Financial Community (CFA), despite the\r\nconsiderable devaluation of the CFA franc in January\r\n1994.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa recently launched by the\r\nSecretary-General will ensure that the United Nations\r\nsystem as a whole, including the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, will help to mobilize the\r\ninternational community. Likewise, the international\r\ncommunity must look into the crucial issue of debt,\r\nbecause it is jeopardizing the development of our\r\ncountries.\r\nMy country believes that new solutions to deal with\r\ndebt, its conversion or refashioning in the interests of\r\neconomic and social development are essential to alleviate\r\nits heavy burden and to make it compatible with\r\ndevelopment, in the spirit of consensus prompted by the\r\nVienna Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nWe reject and label as unjust any discrimination or\r\nclassification between developing countries, as this\r\nusually makes Gabon ineligible for much of the assistance\r\nit requires for its development.\r\nAfrican peoples and Governments are not sitting idly\r\nby, waiting for assistance from the international\r\ncommunity. They are tirelessly making tremendous efforts\r\nto overcome the crisis they face. I am pleased to mention\r\nin this respect the positive role that the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity is playing in backing our efforts.\r\nOAU, in submitting the Treaty Establishing the\r\nAfrican Economic Community in June 1991 in Abuja to\r\nour Heads of State and Government for signature,\r\nunderstood that in the new international scenario,\r\nmultilateral relations supersede bilateral relations.\r\nThe Abuja Agreement entered into force in May\r\n1994, and the first ministerial session of its Economic and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 8 October 1996\r\nSocial Commission will be held next November in Abidjan.\r\nSubregional economic communities are becoming stronger\r\nall the time. Outside institutional frameworks, these\r\neconomic blocs are implementing common programmes on\r\ncurrency, payment methods, business law, the development\r\nof scientific and technological capacity, energy resources,\r\nthe environment and so on.\r\nIn the Central Africa subregion, our countries are\r\ninvolved also in subregional integration, which they see as\r\na major component of development policy.\r\nIt was in this spirit that the thirtieth summit of the\r\nCentral African Customs and Economic Union was\r\nconvened in Yaoundé, Cameroon, from 20 to 22\r\nDecember 1994. The entry into force of customs reform\r\non 1 July 1995 and the signing in July 1996 in Libreville\r\nof a text that establishes the Central African Economic\r\nand Monetary Community are designed to coordinate and\r\nstrengthen the various regional integration efforts.\r\nThese are the main ideas that Gabon wishes, through\r\nme, to contribute to our consideration of the major\r\nconcerns facing the international community today.\r\nIndeed, some of these questions are far from being\r\nresolved. We hope that discussion of these issues will\r\ncontinue, without getting bogged down and with the\r\nparticipation of all, in order to find solutions that can\r\nprovide equitable and comprehensive guarantees for the\r\ninterests of all of our countries. These interests are,\r\nbasically, participation in forging a future for the United\r\nNations; the maintenance and consolidation of peace;\r\nprogress; and economic development.\r\nMembers may have noticed that I have dwelt on\r\neconomic development concerns. I have done so not\r\nbecause I am biased, but because we in Gabon believe\r\nthat true peace cannot exist amid poverty and destruction.\r\nAs the Romans said, “Si vis pacem, para bellum” — “If\r\nyou desire peace, prepare for war”.\r\nToday, on the threshold of the twenty-first century,\r\nand in both domestic and international contexts, we\r\nshould say instead, “If you desire peace, prepare for\r\ndevelopment”, because development and economic\r\nprogress has truly become the face of peace.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
