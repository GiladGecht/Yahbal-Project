(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Tofilau Eti Alesana, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Independent State of\r\nWestern Samoa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Independent State of Western Samoa.\r\nMr. Tofilau Eti Alesana, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Independent State of Samoa,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nIndependent State of Samoa, Mr. Tofilau Eti Alesana, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Alesana (Samoa): Samoa congratulates you most\r\nwarmly on your highly acclaimed election. It is a particular\r\npleasure for me to express to you our full confidence in and\r\nsupport for your presidency. I want also to pay tribute to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal\r\nfor his outstanding service and leadership during the\r\nhistoric fiftieth session of the Assembly.\r\nSamoa welcomes the adoption by this Assembly of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT),\r\nwhich I will sign on behalf of my Government later\r\ntoday. We are signing the Treaty because it is what we\r\nhave all sought for so long. We applaud and thank\r\nAustralia for the initiative to bring the Treaty directly to\r\nthe General Assembly. For us in the Pacific, the CTBT\r\nbrings to an end a long and unsatisfactory situation. Too\r\nmany nuclear weapons, far too many, were tested in our\r\nregion, and we remain fearful of the consequences,\r\nespecially to our fragile environment and marine\r\nresources. Like others, we acknowledge the shortcomings\r\nof the CTBT and regret that it was not possible to reach\r\nthe required consensus in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament. But that must not be allowed to stand in\r\nthe way of the work that remains to be done. The CTBT\r\nis a mark of critical progress. We must all now employ\r\nthe most serious effort in moving the disarmament\r\nprocess further, including bringing the CTBT into force.\r\nToday the international community is united, perhaps\r\nmore so than at any other time, in recognizing the\r\ncomplete elimination of all nuclear weapons as a\r\nfundamental goal. Samoa is deeply committed to this\r\ngoal, and we will continue to work for its achievement\r\ntogether with other members of the United Nations as\r\nwell as with members of civil society.\r\nIt is a matter of the greatest encouragement to my\r\nGovernment to have the favourable opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on the question of the\r\nlegality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. We\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nwelcome in particular the Court’s very timely reminder of\r\nthe obligation to pursue in good faith, and to bring to a\r\nconclusion, negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.\r\nWe accept entirely the important opinion of the Court that\r\nnuclear disarmament, in all its aspects, must be under strict\r\nand effective international control.\r\nI should also acknowledge the signing earlier this year\r\nby the United States of America, the United Kingdom and\r\nFrance of the Protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear Free\r\nZone Treaty. The prompt ratification by France is\r\nappreciated, and we look forward to full adherence by all\r\nnuclear-weapon States. We believe that their full\r\nparticipation will not only inspire confidence within our\r\nregion, but will also carry a message of hope for the rest of\r\nthe international community.\r\nWe place considerable faith in the importance of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones and the vital role they play in\r\nthe disarmament process. During this session, along with\r\nother delegations, Samoa will support efforts aimed at\r\ndeveloping links and enhancing cooperation among southern\r\nhemisphere nuclear-weapon-free zones.\r\nWe are from a region which treasures peace and\r\nsecurity, and we seek for ourselves the highest measure of\r\npeaceful coexistence with all countries. We therefore share\r\nin full the anguish of our fellow humans in all countries\r\nwho are being denied the conditions to live and to develop\r\nin peace and in fulfilment.\r\nMy Government welcomes the developments in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and the implementation of the Dayton\r\nAgreement. Our hope is that the recent elections too will\r\nserve to provide confidence and trust among all the parties.\r\nWe continue to pray for lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast. We commend President Clinton for initiating the\r\nrecent Washington meetings, and we urge all sides, in the\r\nrenewed negotiations now taking place in the region, to\r\nmake every effort possible to restore stability and direction\r\nto the peace process in the spirit of mutual respect.\r\nWe are also a country which cherishes the United\r\nNations Charter and the fundamental principles for which\r\nour Organization stands. This is the basis for our support of\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China.\r\nWe have faith in the elaboration of rules to regulate\r\ninternational behaviour and cooperation. Increasingly,\r\ndevelopments in the international system require both State\r\nand citizen to submit to international scrutiny. One area\r\nthat calls for attention concerns serious humanitarian\r\noffences and crimes of international concern, including\r\nterrorism. Samoa fully supports the early establishment of\r\nan international criminal court to deal with these crimes.\r\nReforms of the United Nations were given a great\r\ndeal of focus at the fiftieth session and much has already\r\nbeen said during this general debate, and rightly so. At\r\nalmost every level, the Organization remains in need of\r\nsubstantial change and improvement. My own country is\r\nfully committed in its support for the ongoing efforts to\r\nstrengthen and revitalize our Organization to make it\r\nmore democratic, fair and representative. I must say,\r\nhowever, that having only a small delegation to cope with\r\nthe multifaceted work being carried out in the five high-\r\nlevel Working Groups, we feel both disadvantaged and,\r\nat times, dispirited about the pace and often the direction\r\nof the discussions.\r\nThe membership of the Security Council must be\r\nenlarged to reflect the realities of the present time and to\r\nenhance the Council’s effectiveness and legitimacy. There\r\nis need to give particular consideration to the case of\r\nJapan and Germany. My Government is also giving the\r\nmost serious thought to proposals, such as that of Italy,\r\nthat would ensure the proper and regular representation of\r\nsmall States and their concerns in the work of the\r\nCouncil. We think the discussions during this session\r\nshould try and focus on areas with regard to which there\r\nis reasonable chance of progress and on which significant\r\nconsensus can be consolidated. We do not see the point\r\nin endless open-ended discussions.\r\nWe share fully the concerns voiced about the very\r\nserious and unsatisfactory financial situation of the United\r\nNations. The payment of assessed contributions is a freely\r\naccepted responsibility and a solemn duty that all States\r\nmust discharge promptly and without condition. Samoa\r\nwillingly accepts this duty and will continue to meet its\r\nown financial obligations. However, we must say again\r\nthat the current floor rate has rendered the present scale\r\nof assessments inequitable for small and least developed\r\nStates like my own. A recent report of the Committee on\r\nContributions has given attention to this anomaly, and we\r\nfeel that timely action must be taken to work out a fairer\r\nsystem of assessment based on capacity to pay in real\r\nterms.\r\nNext year, during your presidency, Sir, we shall\r\nhave to undertake the five-year review of Agenda 21. It\r\nwill be a first and timely opportunity for comprehensive\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nassessment and for giving momentum to sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Given your prominence at the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development in 1992, we\r\nshall have to look to you for an extra measure of leadership\r\nto ensure solid results from the review and effective\r\nperformance from the institutions charged with\r\nimplementing Agenda 21.\r\nSamoa, together with other small island States,\r\ncontinues to emphasize the importance of the Programme\r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States. It is a realistic plan for our sustainable\r\neconomic development. While our endeavours to implement\r\nthe Programme of Action have been greatly assisted and\r\nfacilitated by United Nations organs, achievement is\r\nultimately a matter of national effort and perseverance.\r\nWith the crucial support of the international community, we\r\nmust continue to hold high the ethic of self-sufficiency.\r\nThe sea and its resources provide real prospects for\r\nour development. The legal regimes that govern them and\r\ntheir use are matters of vital importance to Samoa. They\r\nwill continue to receive our closest attention. We welcome\r\nthe election of members of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the establishment of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority. We think it is appropriate\r\nto grant United Nations observer status to the Authority and\r\nwe will support the efforts to strengthen the organization of\r\nthe Authority and to ensure its financial viability.\r\nThe preservation of our environment is a major\r\npreoccupation for my country. We will continue to make\r\nevery effort to be engaged in international discussions and\r\nto contribute to the development of international\r\nenvironmental principles and modalities to ensure that our\r\nconcerns are adequately reflected. Recourse to international\r\nlaw and to effective international mechanisms is the\r\nultimate protection and security for small States.\r\nThe global climate is changing, and the impact of this,\r\nespecially the rise in the sea level, pose the most serious\r\ndangers for Samoa and for all small islands. As a member\r\nof the Alliance of Small Island States, we have pressed and\r\nwill continue to press our concerns for immediate and\r\neffective international action.\r\nThe second assessment report of the Intergovernmental\r\nPanel on Climate Change confirms what we have long\r\nfeared: human activity is warming and changing the climate\r\nsystem. Ministers of the Environment who attended the\r\nsecond Conference of the Parties in Geneva in July this\r\nyear endorsed the report as the most comprehensive and\r\nauthoritative assessment of climate science.\r\nThe Panel’s report underlines the real urgency of the\r\nclimate change negotiations mandated at Berlin last year.\r\nCurrent commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\r\nunder the Convention will not be enough to arrest global\r\nwarming, and additional and effective commitments by\r\nindustrialized countries extending beyond the year 2000\r\nmust be established. In 1994, the Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates submitted possible solutions as set out in its draft\r\nprotocol. It remains the only complete proposal on the\r\ntable.\r\nWe now have barely a year before the need to\r\nfinalize negotiations of a protocol or another legal\r\ninstrument to strengthen the Convention on Climate\r\nChange for adoption at the Conference of the Parties next\r\nyear in Kyoto, Japan. We call on all Convention parties\r\nto move with all seriousness and urgency on the matter.\r\nThe General Assembly has a full and comprehensive\r\nagenda before it. Under your leadership we have every\r\nreason to look forward to firm and positive results.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Independent State of Western\r\nSamoa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tofilau Eti Alesana, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Independent State\r\nof Samoa, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Malawi, His\r\nExcellency The Honourable George Nga Mtafu.\r\nMr. Mtafu (Malawi): Let me begin, Sir, by\r\nextending to you my heartfelt congratulations on your\r\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Malawi holds you and\r\nyour great country, Malaysia, in very high esteem. Your\r\nelection to preside over this important session, soon after\r\nthe special commemorative session, surely demonstrates\r\nthe confidence that the international community as a\r\nwhole has in you and your country. I have no doubt that\r\nyou will guide the deliberations of the Assembly to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to your predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, for\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nthe very skilful manner in which he conducted the\r\ndeliberations of the fiftieth session. As we all know, the\r\nearlier part of that session coincided with the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, an occasion which attracted an unprecedented\r\ngathering of world leaders as well as other high-level\r\nrepresentatives. In spite of the demands which the\r\nceremony imposed on the Organization, Mr. do Amaral met\r\nthe challenge with admirable tact and tenacity. To him we\r\nwish to say “well done” for a job brilliantly executed.\r\nThe fiftieth session of the General Assembly was a\r\nmilestone in the life of the United Nations. It not only\r\nsymbolized the coming of age of the Organization but gave\r\ndelegations an opportunity for serious reflection and\r\nappraisal of the various aspects of the Organization and its\r\noperations. It was therefore not surprising to us that reform\r\nwas, and continues to be, the main theme of the\r\ndeliberations.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that reform of the\r\nOrganization is being pursued with vigour and a renewed\r\nsense of direction. Indeed, we cannot wish away the\r\ninspiring words of wisdom that came out of the statements\r\nof the world leaders who addressed the Assembly during\r\nthe Special Commemorative Meeting. The United Nations\r\nneeds to be strengthened for it to respond fully to the many\r\npolitical and economic challenges that face the world today.\r\nWe all agree that now is the time for the Security\r\nCouncil to be democratized in such a way that its\r\ncomposition corresponds equitably with the increase in the\r\nmembership of the Organization. Its working methods and\r\nprocedures also need to be enhanced in order to bring about\r\nmore transparency and accountability. The continuing\r\ndebate on this subject has clearly revealed to us the\r\nessential issues to be dealt with. We are encouraged by\r\nwhat seems to be an emerging spirit of accommodation on\r\nthe subject. It is our sincere hope that the hurdles that\r\nremain ahead will be surmounted in the same spirit of give\r\nand take. More significantly, it is necessary to bear in mind\r\nthat while the relevant Working Group is open-ended in\r\nspace, it is not open-ended in time. The sense of urgency\r\nwith which world leaders addressed the question of reform\r\nduring the commemorative ceremony demands that work on\r\nthis matter move forward resolutely.\r\nEven the most reformed United Nations cannot\r\nperform without the necessary resources. It is no secret that\r\nthe operations of the Organization have in recent years been\r\nhampered by financial constraints. We are encouraged by\r\nthe progress so far achieved in the High-level Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Financial Situation of the United\r\nNations. We, however, would have liked more sustained,\r\naction-oriented progress so that we could put to rest a\r\nmatter which has greater implications, including for the\r\nmorale of the staff of the Organization. We trust that the\r\ndeliberations will continue to address the issues in an\r\nopen and transparent manner. At the same time, it is our\r\nsincere hope that Member States will continue to honour\r\ntheir existing obligations without introducing linkages.\r\nTwo years ago, the President of the Republic of\r\nMalawi, His Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi, stood here at\r\nthis very rostrum to herald the dawning of a new era in\r\nMalawi on 17 June 1994, when Malawians ushered in\r\ntheir first democratically elected Government after 30\r\nyears of dictatorship. It is common knowledge that the\r\nnew Government inherited a multitude of problems with\r\ndebilitating consequences for the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment and welfare of the Malawian people.\r\nUndaunted by these enormous challenges, the new\r\nGovernment, soon after assuming power, put into place\r\npolicies with the overall aim of reducing poverty and\r\nimproving education and social services, particularly\r\namong people living in rural areas. Two and a half years\r\non, the wide-ranging economic and structural reforms that\r\nthe Government embarked upon are increasingly yielding\r\npositive results. General economic activity is expanding\r\nat a remarkable pace, inflation is coming down steadily,\r\npublic finances are in the process of being restored to\r\nsustainable levels, and the situation of the balance of\r\npayments and foreign reserves continues to improve, thus\r\ngradually restoring confidence in the economy.\r\nMost significantly, the liberalization of markets and\r\nrelative prices in commodities have increased work and\r\nproduction incentives and opened opportunities for many\r\nMalawians. We remain committed to removing the few\r\nremaining rigidities in the economy, which in the past\r\nhave tended to cause discrimination against the common\r\nman in the village. The opening up of the economy and\r\nthe expansion of opportunities for all will continue to\r\nguide us in pursuing our economic agenda. We are,\r\nhowever, the first to realize that there are many stumbling\r\nblocks ahead.\r\nMalawi is a very small country, and is landlocked.\r\nLike other countries, we too have our own vision of a\r\nbetter and more prosperous Malawi. Through our own\r\n2020 Programme, we hope to solicit the views of the\r\nvarious sectors of the national populace and chart the\r\ndirection of the country’s development to the year 2020.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nSo far, the public has shown considerable enthusiasm in the\r\nongoing consultations, in the same way that they\r\nparticipated in the political transformation of the country\r\ntwo years ago. It is our desire and commitment to control\r\nour economic destiny. The level of expectation created by\r\nthe democratic dispensation needs to be matched by\r\neconomic empowerment and social development. To have\r\nit otherwise would be to compromise democracy.\r\nThe Government and the people of Malawi appreciate\r\nand are thankful for the assistance which the international\r\ncommunity is rendering our country. We are hopeful that\r\nthe international community will continue to help Malawi\r\nrealize its dreams and its vision. We call upon our\r\ndevelopment partners to continue to augment the assistance\r\nthat they are currently extending to the people of Malawi.\r\nWe also wish to appeal to our cooperating partners to come\r\nand invest in our country. The economic and investment\r\nclimate is now more conducive than ever before.\r\nMalawi has welcomed with enthusiasm the launching\r\nby the international community of programmes which aim\r\nat encouraging development in Africa. For the past few\r\nyears, hope in the continent was fanned by the adoption of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s. The much talked about diversification\r\nof the economies of African States was warmly received as\r\na move which would strengthen the predominantly primary\r\nraw material-producing basis of the countries’ economies.\r\nIt is sad to note that the financial resources required for the\r\nprogramme have not matched the enthusiasm that revolved\r\naround the launching of the New Agenda. My delegation\r\nsincerely hopes that the mid-term review of the Agenda,\r\nwhich has just concluded, will reignite the enthusiasm of us\r\nall and enhance the political will of all the cooperating\r\npartners.\r\nMore recently, my Government welcomed the\r\nlaunching by the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. Malawi is\r\nparticularly pleased with the innovative nature of the\r\nInitiative. The conferring of the leadership of the\r\nprogramme on the Africans themselves only confirms what\r\nwe have always desired to see happen. In addition, the\r\nspecificity of the objectives sought under the Initiative is a\r\nmove in the right direction. We commend the international\r\ncommunity for this programme and call upon the lead\r\ninstitutions not to waver at the implementation stage. For\r\nour part, we stand ready to cooperate fully with the other\r\nimplementing partners, and so far that is precisely what we\r\nare doing.\r\nMalawi is following with interest the current work\r\non the elaboration of an Agenda for Development. My\r\ndelegation notes that the basic guidelines for an Agenda\r\nfor Development are well known and have already been\r\nnegotiated and agreed upon in the various United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. What remains is essentially the\r\nimplementation of the action plans in a more integrated\r\nand innovative way, entailing political commitment by all\r\nactive members of the international community. We look\r\nforward to an early conclusion of an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. We in Malawi see all these initiatives as\r\ncomplementary to our own ongoing efforts to improve the\r\nwell-being of our people.\r\nMalawi notes with satisfaction the important role\r\nthat the United Nations plays in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in various parts of the\r\nworld. We welcome the steady progress which has been\r\nachieved in Angola and hail the Government for\r\nhonouring its commitments. At the same time, we wish to\r\nappeal to the leadership of the National Union for the\r\nTotal Independence of Angola (UNITA) to adhere to the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol and related\r\nagreements. We have always maintained that peace in\r\nAngola will be beneficial not only to the people of\r\nAngola, a people tired of war, but also to our southern\r\nAfrican subcontinent as a whole.\r\nMy Government remains disturbed by the recent\r\ndevelopments in Burundi. The July 1996 coup d’état was\r\na major setback to the democratic process, and we\r\nsupport the position taken by the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and the countries of the Great Lakes region.\r\nWe denounce the coup d’état. Malawi does not condone\r\nany takeover of power by any party through\r\nunconstitutional means. Quite frankly, we in Africa are\r\nsick and tired of this “disease”. We want the ballot box\r\nto be the referee in African politics, once and for all.\r\nCoups d’états have contributed negatively to the fame of\r\nour otherwise rich and beautiful continent. We remain\r\nconvinced that the Arusha process is the only credible\r\nway of bringing about peace in Burundi. We therefore\r\ncall upon the military rulers in Burundi to pave the way\r\nfor the resumption of the Arusha peace negotiations.\r\nThe installation in August 1996 of an interim\r\nGovernment in Liberia led by Mrs. Ruth Perry gives us\r\nall hope that the warring factions have chosen the way of\r\npeace and reconciliation after years of the senseless\r\nkilling of innocent civilians. Malawi commends the\r\nleadership of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) for having successfully brokered the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\npeace plan among the warring factions. We reaffirm our\r\nfaith in the Abuja Agreement and express the hope that the\r\nimplementation schedule agreed upon recently will lead to\r\nsuccessful elections next year. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to closely monitor developments\r\nand assist the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in\r\nthe noble work that it is carrying out in Liberia.\r\nThere remains cause for genuine concern over\r\ndevelopments in Western Sahara. My Government has\r\nnoted that for a long time now, progress has stalled over\r\nthe identification of eligible voters in the referendum. The\r\nrepeated extension of the mandate of the United Nations\r\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\r\n(MINURSO) is a show of commitment by the international\r\ncommunity which should not be taken for granted. Malawi\r\ntherefore calls upon the principal players in the process to\r\nshow some flexibility so that an amicable solution to the\r\ncurrent impasse can be reached.\r\nDevelopments in countries of the former Yugoslavia\r\nhave recently been encouraging. The cessation of hostilities\r\nin the Balkans under the Dayton Peace Agreement signed\r\nearly this year and the recent elections have generated\r\nconsiderable hope within the international community. It is\r\nthe hope of my Government that no reckless moves will be\r\ntaken which could jeopardize the existing momentum\r\ntowards stability.\r\nDuring the past few years considerable progress\r\ntowards a comprehensive peace settlement has been made\r\nin the Middle East. We have in the past expressed support\r\nfor the peace initiative which, since its birth at Madrid on\r\n30 October 1991, has grown steadily and has given rise to\r\nimportant agreements between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization (PLO). We remain convinced that\r\nthe path that was started in Madrid is the way forward. We\r\ntherefore urge all the parties concerned to abide by their\r\nprevious commitments and move forward to achieve the\r\naspirations of the people of the region and the world. The\r\nrecent disturbing developments only show how thin the\r\ndividing line is between peace and violence.\r\nThe international community has recently been\r\nreminded, through violent clashes, of the volatile situation\r\nthat exists in divided Cyprus. The division, which arose\r\nover two decades ago, remains a constant reminder that the\r\ninternational community has yet to boldly tackle the\r\nsituation there. My Government hopes that the issue of\r\nCyprus will be pursued with commitment by both the\r\nmediators and the parties concerned.\r\nIt is the wish of my Government that the long-\r\nstanding question of the international status of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan will be peacefully resolved\r\nin a manner acceptable to the Governments on both sides\r\nof the Taiwan Strait. We are encouraged by the recent\r\nreported indications that the two sides are ready to talk to\r\neach other. However, the Malawi Government wishes to\r\nreaffirm its commitment to the promotion of freedom,\r\nhuman rights and democratic principles and therefore\r\nsupports the aspirations of the more than 21 million\r\nTaiwanese people to recognition and full participation in\r\nall the activities of the international community.\r\nWe and our prestigious Organization should be\r\npreventing and resolving conflicts. We should not sit by\r\nas confrontation builds. Instead, we should find the time\r\nto initiate dialogue and lasting solutions, and not always\r\nhave to wake up and respond to emergencies. The\r\nbenchmark should not always be to please the stronger; it\r\nshould also be to support the weak and vulnerable and\r\nthose under stress. But apart from our trade interests, our\r\nmoral obligation must be renewed every day.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming our faith in the\r\nUnited Nations. We believe the United Nations has a vital\r\nrole to play in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Many areas of tension remain the world over.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to act more resolutely in\r\ndealing with these many troubled areas. The United\r\nNations has made and continues to make a difference in\r\nthe lives of millions of people in many countries,\r\nincluding my own, Malawi, in many areas of human\r\nendeavour. We have no doubt that a reformed United\r\nNations will contribute more to making the world a better\r\nplace to live. We are confident, Sir, that under your\r\nstewardship of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly, we, the peoples of the United Nations, will\r\nhave taken another bold step towards a revitalized and\r\nreformed United Nations, a United Nations capable of\r\nfully responding to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Our prayer is, let us boldly resolve and go\r\nforward together to the next millennium.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Ruth Perry, Chairman of the Council\r\nof the Liberian National Transitional Government\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Chairman of the Council of State of the\r\nLiberian National Transitional Government, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Ruth Perry.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nMrs. Perry, Chairman of the Council of State of the\r\nLiberian National Transitional Government, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nChairman of the Council of State of the Liberian National\r\nTransitional Government, Her Excellency Mrs. Ruth Perry,\r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nMrs. Perry: Permit me to express on behalf of my\r\ncountry, Liberia, our sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on\r\nyour unanimous election as President of the General\r\nAssembly. It is our expectation that your tenure will be\r\nmarked by the same distinction that has characterized your\r\nservice to your country, Malaysia.\r\nI express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal,\r\nfor efficiently conducting the proceedings of the historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his continuing dedication to\r\nthe cause of world peace and social justice, which has\r\nprovided the United Nations an opportunity to enhance the\r\ndignity of all mankind in spite of the odds that continue to\r\nfrustrate our common aspirations and our efforts to build a\r\nbetter world.\r\nLiberia bears its share of responsibility for finding\r\nsolutions to the problems of our one world through this\r\nOrganization. Regrettably, the situation in Liberia has not\r\nafforded us the opportunity to participate as actively as\r\nmight be expected.\r\nIt is an honour and privilege for me to stand before\r\nthis world body as Africa’s first female Head of\r\nGovernment. However, it is sad to note that I have assumed\r\nthis leadership at a time when my country, Liberia, is\r\nexperiencing a tragic and senseless war.\r\nThe Liberian civil war, which began more than six\r\nyears ago, has unleashed one of the worst man-made\r\ndisasters in recent memory. It has claimed over 250,000\r\nlives — about 15 per cent of the population; forced over\r\n800,000 Liberians to seek refuge in neighbouring countries;\r\nand left several hundred thousand others internally\r\ndisplaced.\r\nRegrettably, the most vulnerable groups — women,\r\nchildren and the elderly — continue to be victimized by the\r\nravages of disease, hunger and malnutrition, which are\r\ncommonplace under such conditions. The wanton killing\r\nof civilians and the destruction of basic infrastructure,\r\nwhich intensified in April of this year, continue to retard\r\neconomic activities and deprive the people of their\r\nfundamental human rights.\r\nThe painful reality of our child soldiers, child\r\nlabourers and abandoned children in the country point to\r\nthe formidable task that lies ahead as we seek to\r\nrehabilitate them into productive citizens.\r\nThe displacement of large segments of the rural\r\npopulation has curtailed agricultural production. Before\r\nthe war, agriculture accounted for 38 per cent of the gross\r\ndomestic product and 75 per cent of total employment. As\r\na result of continued hostilities, other potentially high\r\neconomic sectors such as rubber, timber, iron ore and\r\nminerals remain inaccessible.\r\nSince 1990, the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) has deployed a peacekeeping\r\nforce in Liberia, in keeping with Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. It had been hoped that this\r\ninitiative, the first by a subregion, would receive the full\r\nsupport of the United Nations. Unfortunately, the\r\nassistance of the international community has been both\r\nslow and inadequate, thereby imposing severe pressure on\r\nthe scarce resources of the member States of ECOWAS.\r\nWhile ECOWAS, in the spirit of African\r\nbrotherhood and solidarity, has taken the initiative in\r\nLiberia, its efforts must be complemented by the\r\ninternational community through the provision of\r\nsubstantial material and financial support to facilitate the\r\nimplementation of the peace process in the country. It is\r\ntherefore my appeal that the United Nations assume its\r\nshare of the burden of peacekeeping in Liberia. The\r\nsubregion is facing extreme economic hardships due to\r\nexternal factors beyond its control.\r\nAfter the failure of several peace agreements, the\r\nmember States of ECOWAS convened a meeting in\r\nAbuja, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in August 1995.\r\nAt that meeting, a decision was taken to include for the\r\nfirst time the leaders of the three major warring factions\r\nin a six-man Council of State. Accordingly, a ceasefire\r\nwas implemented, and Monrovia was maintained as a safe\r\nhaven. The members of the Council of State were\r\ninducted into office on 1 September 1995.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nIn April of this year, the resumption of fighting, with\r\nthe accompanying carnage and illegal seizure and\r\ndestruction of property, dealt another set-back to the peace\r\nprocess. At this juncture, I extend the profound regrets of\r\nthe Liberian Government and people to the international,\r\nintergovernmental, non-governmental and other\r\norganizations that sustained losses as a result of the April\r\nfighting. I pledge that our Administration will do all that\r\nlies within its power to prevent the reoccurrence of such\r\nlawlessness.\r\nThe events of April enabled the leaders of the\r\nsubregion to identify deficiencies in the Agreement and to\r\ntake measures to prevent the reoccurrence of such\r\nbreakdown in the implementation of the peace accord.\r\nAlthough they reaffirmed the Abuja Agreement as the best\r\nframework for finding a lasting solution to the Liberian\r\nconflict, they nevertheless resolved that a change was\r\nnecessary in the leadership to restore confidence and\r\nenhance its performance.\r\nThe parties unanimously selected me to lead Liberia\r\nfrom a devastating war to conditions of peace. The\r\nselection of a woman is a decision that deserves\r\ncommendation; for it is a major victory and a recognition\r\nof the active involvement of Liberian women in the peace\r\nprocess. The resolution of the Liberian conflict is therefore\r\na challenge not only to me but also to all Liberian women\r\nand to the women of Africa and the world, whose advice\r\nand continuing support I deeply appreciate.\r\nOur leadership is challenged with the difficult task of\r\npursuing national reconciliation, national reunification,\r\nrepatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons, and the creation of an enabling\r\nenvironment for the holding of free and fair democratic\r\nelections by May 1997. Additionally, and more demanding,\r\nwe must ensure the successful disarmament of combatants\r\nand their demobilization and reintegration into civil society.\r\nThis task requires us, as a matter of urgency, to first\r\ndisarm our children and redirect their lives. We also have\r\nto address the immense suffering that the war has inflicted\r\non our people. We must establish an independent elections\r\ncommission to conduct free and fair elections under\r\ninternational supervision.\r\nI am confident that, with the support of the United\r\nNations and the international community, the tasks ahead\r\nwill be achieved. All of the parties to the conflict have\r\npledged to me their commitment to the implementation of\r\nthe revised schedule. Despite some signs of retrogression,\r\nour timely intervention and appeals have been heeded,\r\nthus averting the derailment of the process. We are aware\r\nthat our efforts to maintain the ceasefire must be\r\nsustained at every stage of the peace process by timely\r\nintervention and insistence that the terms and conditions\r\nof the peace agreement must be respected by the parties.\r\nThere is a renewed hope for peace in Liberia as a\r\nresult of the decisions taken at the last Abuja summit.\r\nThe failure over the past six years to achieve peace in the\r\ncountry made it imperative that long overdue measures be\r\ntaken to ensure the final and successful implementation of\r\nthe Abuja Agreement.\r\nFirst, due care and consideration was given to the\r\nselection of the Head of Government, with the view of\r\nensuring effective leadership and a sense of purpose.\r\nSecondly, provision was made for the regular monitoring\r\nand assessment of the implementation of the peace\r\nAgreement. This responsibility was assigned to the special\r\nrepresentative of the Chairman of ECOWAS and the\r\nECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia. Thirdly,\r\nECOWAS member States agreed to impose sanctions on\r\nany person or group of persons obstructing the\r\nimplementation of the peace Agreement. These necessary\r\nmeasures will equally require the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Government and people of Liberia share the\r\nconviction of the member States of ECOWAS, as well as\r\nthe international community, that the Abuja peace\r\nAgreement provides the best framework for the resolution\r\nof the Liberian conflict. As Chairman of the Council of\r\nState, I reaffirm my total commitment to the full\r\nimplementation of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia.\r\nWe owe a debt of gratitude to the Government and people\r\nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as well as to other\r\nmember States of ECOWAS, for their untiring efforts and\r\nsacrifices in the quest for peace in Liberia.\r\nWe also extend our gratitude to the Governments of\r\nthe United States of America, the Netherlands and\r\nGermany for their recent assistance to the ECOWAS\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). We thank other friendly\r\nnations that have made, and continue to make,\r\ncontributions to the resolution of the Liberian conflict.\r\nThe Liberian Government appeals for assistance to enable\r\nthe deployment of additional troops to sustain the new\r\nfocus on disarmament and demobilization as well as\r\nensure thereafter the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\r\nour war-torn country.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nIn order to facilitate the rehabilitation of these\r\nchildren, we appeal to friendly Governments to help us\r\nrebuild our educational institutions, especially those\r\nproviding vocational and technical training. As a caring\r\nmother, I urgently need to rehabilitate and grant relief to\r\nthese children. It is one of my principal concerns. In this\r\nregard, I express appreciation to the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for their assistance. It is\r\nmy hope that all mothers and all humanitarian,\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations will\r\nsupport this worthy undertaking. The Liberian children,\r\nindeed the children of our world, are our future.\r\nAs regards the international situation, while we will\r\ncontinue to accord priority to the civil war in Liberia until\r\ngenuine peace is restored, we have not lost sight of other\r\nimportant issues that are of vital concern to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that since the end of the cold\r\nwar, Member States have increasingly taken measures in\r\nsupport of general and complete disarmament, including\r\nnuclear weapons. The establishment of zones of peace in\r\nmost regions of the world and the recent adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which my\r\nGovernment has already signed, are positive developments\r\nin the field of disarmament. It is hoped that further progress\r\nwill be made in the total elimination of nuclear weapons\r\nwithin a given time-frame.\r\nLiberia, which is emerging from conditions of war, is\r\nconcerned about the unrestricted use of conventional\r\nweapons, including anti-personnel landmines. The\r\ninternational community must also focus its attention on\r\nconventional disarmament, since these deadly weapons are\r\nusually resorted to in most conflicts.\r\nInternal strife in several countries resulting from\r\nethnic, religious and racial differences continues to cause\r\ndeath and destruction in Angola, Burundi, Rwanda,\r\nSomalia, the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and my own\r\ncountry. In order to spare the lives of innocent civilians, we\r\nappeal to all parties to enter into dialogue and seek a\r\npolitical settlement of their differences.\r\nAs we move towards the twenty-first century, we are\r\nencouraged by the growing concern about the persistently\r\nslow and unbalanced growth of the world economy. We\r\nhave experienced the direct impact of the uneven\r\ndistribution of resources both among and within nations.\r\nThe crisis in Liberia today is an expression of this\r\nunevenness, which has a direct relationship to poverty and\r\ninstability.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that in every attempt at\r\nfinding a solution, such issues as the debt crisis and the\r\ndecline in official development assistance continue to\r\nhamper our efforts to bring about the required reform in\r\nfavour of the development of our people. This situation\r\ncontinues to undermine development in many regions of\r\nthe world, especially Africa. Today, Africa remains the\r\nonly continent where the level of poverty is causing\r\nincreasing hardship and despair, despite the courageous\r\nefforts by many countries to undertake reforms.\r\nRegrettably, programmes proposed by the\r\ninternational community have yet to receive adequate\r\ndonor assistance to move Africa’s development forward.\r\nWe recall the priority programme for Africa’s economic\r\nrecovery and other measures to address the critical\r\nsituation facing the continent.\r\nIt is in this light that I commend the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa launched earlier\r\nthis year. The initiative requires commitments amounting\r\nto $25 billion over a period of 10 years, to be realized\r\nthrough the reallocation of existing resources, and\r\ncomplements the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nWe therefore plead with the United Nations and its\r\nagencies, international financial institutions and bilateral\r\ndonors to re-examine their attitudes towards Africa’s\r\ndevelopment aspirations. We hope that a solution will be\r\nfound to the extreme burden that debt now imposes on all\r\ncountries, but especially on those coming out of crisis.\r\nIn spite of the difficulties facing Liberia, it has\r\ncontinued to consider the role of women as crucial to the\r\ndevelopment process by advocating an improved status\r\nfor women. Liberia has supported the decisions emanating\r\nfrom conferences on the advancement of women,\r\nparticularly the Beijing Conference held in 1995. My\r\npresence here today as Chairman of the Council of State\r\nis a testimony to Liberia’s support for its women and for\r\nthe rights of women everywhere.\r\nI take this opportunity to say that it would be\r\nadvantageous to all Member States of this Organization if\r\nwe, as world leaders, committed ourselves to a policy of\r\nmutual respect for one another and for our respective\r\npeoples and their legitimate aspirations in life. I am\r\nconvinced that prospects for a peaceful world will be\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nmade greater if we summon the courage to equitably share\r\nwithout restraints the material and technological resources\r\nthat represent our common inheritance on earth.\r\nOnce those considerations become our cherished\r\npreoccupation and the noble focus of our collective\r\nundertakings, the world will enjoy a better future: a future\r\nthat will know no bounds for the collective happiness of\r\nmankind; a future that will be devoid of terrorism and war;\r\nand a future that will not occasion famine, starvation and\r\nhuman degradation; a future without jealousy, hatred or\r\nenvy.\r\nWe can make tomorrow better or worse. The question\r\nis: which will it be? The United Nations system and the\r\nentire international community will be judged on the basis\r\nof their response to this important question.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Chairman of the Council of State of the\r\nLiberian National Transitional Government, Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Ruth Perry, for the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Ruth Perry, Chairman of the Council of State of\r\nthe Liberian National Transitional Government, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan, Her Excellency Mrs. Roza\r\nI. Otunbayeva.\r\nMrs. Otunbayeva (Kyrgyzstan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Guided by feelings of great respect for Malaysia,\r\nwhich plays an increasingly significant role in regional and\r\nworld affairs, I welcome the election to the presidency of\r\nthis session of the General Assembly the experienced and\r\nwell-known representative of that country, Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail.\r\nWe, the newly independent States of the former Soviet\r\nUnion, are celebrating this year the fifth anniversary of our\r\nindependence and national statehood. My country is\r\nsuccessfully concluding a stage in its structural reforms and\r\nhas achieved macroeconomic stabilization. We have\r\nmanaged to halt the decline in production and this year we\r\nexpect an increase in production of 3 to 4 per cent. The\r\nannual rate of inflation is not expected to exceed 26 per\r\ncent. We are finalizing the legal basis for a market\r\neconomy and for building new institutions. The goal now\r\nis to join the World Trade Organization.\r\nRegional cooperation is gaining in strength. In the\r\ncontext of the Central Asian Union, the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization and the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States, we are creating conditions conducive\r\nto the free movement of goods, capital, services and\r\nlabour. Entirely new areas are now linked by\r\ntransportation lines, and the groundwork is being laid for\r\nlong-term, comprehensive efforts to ensure the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the Central Asian region.\r\nWe, the newly independent States, are rapidly\r\nbecoming involved in the globalization process of the\r\nworld economy; we are deriving clear benefits from this\r\nas well as significant damage and losses. Alongside the\r\nliberalization of trade and the opening of State borders,\r\nour fragile economies are being affected by transnational\r\norganized crime, including drug trafficking. Drug dealers\r\nare corrupting State institutions and are eroding the basis\r\nof our young statehood.\r\nDrug trafficking and arms trade are flourishing in\r\nconflict areas. It is evident that powerful international\r\ncriminal forces, which are reaping profits from this, are\r\ninterested in the continuation and exacerbation of conflicts\r\nin Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Drugs have a destructive\r\neffect on weak and powerful countries alike. Local\r\ncapacities and international assistance from donor\r\ncountries to fight drug trafficking pale in comparison to\r\nthe scale and geo-economic destructive effect of the drug\r\ntrade.\r\nFive Central Asian countries were the second group,\r\nfollowing Eastern European nations, to sign a\r\nmemorandum of understanding with the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme. We continue to\r\nfight this evil through regional cooperation. A subregional\r\nprogramme for Central Asia provides an opportunity to\r\ndevelop projects that provide legitimate alternatives to\r\npeople engaged in the cultivation and transport of illegal\r\ncrops. My country welcomes consideration of this issue\r\nat a special session of the General Assembly to be held in\r\n1998, and is convinced that the world community will\r\ntriple its support to programmes to stop the flow of drugs\r\nto the countries of the North.\r\nSustainable development formed the basis of the\r\nnational human development strategy prepared on the\r\ninitiative of the President of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan,\r\nMr. Askar Akayev. During the past decade, from Vienna\r\nto Istanbul, the international community, under the aegis\r\nof the United Nations, has defined goals, tasks and\r\npriorities for world social development. Kyrgyzstan\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nintends creatively and fully to implement the decisions\r\ntaken. We look forward with great interest to the\r\ndiscussions on Agenda 21 that are due to take place at the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly to be convened in\r\n1997.\r\nCountries with economies in transition are going\r\nthrough a difficult period of economic rehabilitation. The\r\nproblems of attracting direct foreign investment are\r\nparticularly acute. We are inspired by the experience of the\r\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe that have\r\nsuccessfully managed the transition to a market economy.\r\nMany of them have joined the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development, and established national\r\nexport and import banks and State insurance facilities for\r\nprivate enterprises abroad. Today it is becoming\r\nincreasingly clear that timely and adequate assistance and\r\ncredits from the international community, combined with\r\nenormous efforts by the countries themselves, are enabling\r\ncountries in transition to emerge rapidly from their crises\r\nand thus join the group of development donors. The effect\r\nof such a multi-layered approach to resolving common\r\ndevelopment problems is clear, and there is no doubt that\r\nseveral post-Soviet independent countries could shortly be\r\nin the vanguard of this progress.\r\nFor a long time much has been said about the need for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions in strengthening peace and resolving\r\neconomic development problems. In recent years a huge\r\nnumber of regional alliances have come into being in\r\nresponse to contemporary challenges, and they are actively\r\ncooperating with one another. Today, it would be difficult\r\nto overestimate the importance of their role in resolving\r\ninter-ethnic disputes and conflicts and developing trade,\r\ntransport, communications and sociocultural relationships in\r\nthese regions. The United Nations could systematize and\r\nsummarize the successful work of these unions and\r\nalliances, which are like blood vessels in the way they link\r\nthe United Nations system with the World Bank, regional\r\nbanks and the International Monetary Fund, offering an\r\neffective regional approach to dealing with the entire range\r\nof complex issues on today’s world agenda.\r\nGeo-economic regions such as the Fergana valley are\r\nfacing a great number of acute problems, including\r\nunemployment, environmental deterioration, poverty,\r\ninequality of women and all types of crime. They can, and\r\nshould, be a focal point for the attention and effort of all\r\ncountries concerned in Central Asia, for the United Nations\r\nsystem, and for donor countries. Consistent and vigorous\r\nefforts to resolve the urgent development problems of this\r\ndensely populated valley will also act as necessary\r\npreventive actions to strengthen security, stability and\r\npeace between the States of the region.\r\nMy country wholly supports the efforts of the United\r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope and the Commonwealth of Independent States, to\r\nbring about a peaceful settlement in the inter-Tajik\r\nconflict. We commend the contributions made by Russia\r\nand Iran, and welcome the mediating role of\r\nTurkmenistan, which has opened a goodwill office for\r\nconducting the inter-Tajik talks.\r\nEvery conflict has a recognizable identity. It is time\r\nfor the United Nations to synthesize and develop the legal\r\nbasis, procedures, and methods of work for each party\r\ninvolved, whether they are representatives of international\r\norganizations, the parties to the conflict or various\r\nworking groups. The United Nations should have regular\r\nconsultations with the countries in the region and with the\r\nregional alliances.\r\nBecause of the protracted nature of the crisis, which\r\nhas caused enormous suffering to innocent civilians, and\r\ngiven the widespread consequences of the hostilities for\r\nneighbouring countries, we believe that a solution to the\r\ninter-Tajik conflict should be the basis for the long-term\r\nsustainable development of that country and for the whole\r\nof Central Asia.\r\nThe exodus of refugees from Tajikistan is\r\ncontinuing. This is a painful subject for the people of\r\nTajikistan, and we feel for them in their suffering. The\r\nratification by Kyrgyzstan this year of the 1951\r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees of and its\r\n1967 Protocol was not merely a demonstration of our\r\nrespect for human rights but reflected our willingness to\r\nshare the international community’s burden of\r\nresponsibility for providing assistance to people who are\r\nforced to leave their homes to seek protection for\r\nthemselves and their children. The conference on the\r\nproblem of refugees and displaced persons in the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, which was\r\norganized by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees in Geneva in May 1996,\r\ndemonstrated the international community’s full support\r\nfor refugees from Tajikistan.\r\nThe humanitarian situation remains critical,\r\nparticularly in mountainous areas, which are very hard to\r\nreach, and especially now, with winter approaching. We\r\nare convinced that not only the United Nations and its\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nspecialized agencies but the World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund, the European Union and the Organization\r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development will work\r\ntogether successfully to promote a peaceful settlement of\r\nthe conflict and alleviate the hardship and pain of the long-\r\nsuffering Tajik people.\r\nWith regard to recent events in Afghanistan, we\r\nbelieve that a comprehensive political settlement must be\r\nfound to the Afghan conflict, that territorial integrity cannot\r\nbe ensured and that non-interference in the internal affairs\r\nof this sovereign country must be respected. We call on the\r\nSecurity Council to work for national reconciliation among\r\nthe warring factions and to seek an end to the long,\r\ndebilitating war that has destabilized the Asian continent as\r\na whole.\r\nHalf a century of experience of world political\r\ndevelopment under the aegis of the United Nations leads us\r\nto conclude that there should be more non-conflict,\r\nsustainably developing nuclear-weapon-free zones. This\r\nwould guarantee peace and security. The long-awaited hour\r\nhas come: the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has\r\nbeen signed by an overwhelming majority of States\r\nMembers of the United Nations. When I signed the Treaty\r\non behalf of my people, as the representative of a country\r\nthat until recently had been squeezed from both sides by\r\ntwo of the world’s largest nuclear-weapon-testing areas, I\r\nexperienced a special feeling of satisfaction and hope for\r\nthe future of my country and for the whole world.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nare major milestones on the road to a future nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. We are resolved to make Central Asia\r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone. Support and appropriate\r\nguarantees from the nuclear States would constitute an\r\nimportant prerequisite for that achievement.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is in favour of reforming the\r\nUnited Nations. The permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil should be enlarged to include Germany, Japan and\r\nrepresentatives of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nEquitable geographical representation would also mean an\r\nincrease the number of non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil. The nature of the interaction between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly should also change, and\r\nbecome more transparent.\r\nSince becoming Members of the United Nations less\r\nthan five years ago, the newly independent States have\r\nbecome full-fledged members of the United Nations family.\r\nWe, like others, were pleased about the establishment of\r\npeace in Haiti and Bosnia, and paid tribute to the many\r\npeople who lost their lives, in whatever part of the world.\r\nWith regard to regional alliances, we are developing our\r\nrelations equally with West and East, South and North.\r\nThree countries of our group — Kyrgyzstan, Kazakstan\r\nand Uzbekistan — are creating a Central Asian\r\npeacekeeping battalion to act as a future reserve force of\r\nBlue Helmets. On a basis of mutual respect, Russia,\r\nKazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan this year concluded\r\na treaty on confidence-building measures in the military\r\nsphere on the border with the People’s Republic of China.\r\nWe are determined to learn every step of the way. We,\r\ntogether with the other Member States, are on the road to\r\nthe twenty-first century. By combining our efforts we\r\nshall be worthy to meet its new challenges.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\ndistinguished Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Equatorial Guinea, His Excellency\r\nMr. Miguel Oyono Ndong Mifumu.\r\nMr. Oyono Ndong Mifumu (Equatorial Guinea)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): At the outset, Sir, allow me\r\nto join with earlier speakers in congratulating Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session. His election is\r\nunquestionably a recognition of the role that his country\r\nhas been playing in advancing the ideals of our\r\nOrganization. It is also a great honour, and a personal\r\ntribute to his well-known experience as a diplomat. We\r\nwish him every success in his work during this session.\r\nWe are aware of the substantial number of topics for\r\ndiscussion during this session, and their subject matter.\r\nFirst, however, I wish to discharge the duty given me by\r\nthe President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, His\r\nExcellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, and convey to the\r\nrepresentatives of the friendly countries meeting here\r\ntoday his greetings and wishes for success in their work\r\nduring this session.\r\nA rapid review of our agenda reveals that many of\r\nthe issues go to the heart and central purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations. However, it is also true that most of them\r\nhave been the subject of broad-ranging and thorough\r\ndebate at many other sessions of the Assembly. To avoid\r\nrepetition, therefore, I shall briefly sum up my country’s\r\nposition on these main issues.\r\nDuring the past 50 years the United Nations has\r\nconstantly worked to heighten the awareness of the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\ninternational community and the conscience of the world\r\nwith respect to international peace and stability, justice,\r\nequality and development throughout the world. We do not\r\nwish to sound pessimistic, but this session of the Assembly\r\nis taking place in a context of great uncertainty. Some are\r\neven questioning whether the United Nations still has the\r\nability to contribute to solving the problems that have arisen\r\non a daily basis in recent years. For this reason, the first\r\nproblem that we must face is whether what we have been\r\nbuilding over the past 50 years is valid when tackling these\r\nissues. For Equatorial Guinea, the answer is “yes” in\r\nprinciple. However, we must also acknowledge that the\r\nsystem we invented 50 years ago must be adapted to\r\ncurrent realities.\r\nApart from considering the various options for\r\nreforming the United Nations system, we must ask\r\nourselves seriously whether we are prepared to provide the\r\nOrganization with the legal machinery to make its important\r\ndecision-making bodies — the General Assembly and\r\nSecurity Council — more democratic. My country believes\r\nthat the credibility of the United Nations is at stake. We\r\nhave within our grasp an opportunity to make the United\r\nNations the centre for the global harmonization of our\r\nendeavours to achieve the common purposes articulated in\r\nthe Charter. When making decisions that affect all the\r\ncountries in our Organization, therefore, the necessary\r\nconsensus must prevail for us to find appropriate solutions.\r\nGiven this belief, I wish to make a modest contribution on\r\ncertain issues that we consider vital to the Organization.\r\nReform of the Security Council is an extremely\r\nimportant and complex issue, which calls for very careful\r\nthought. Equatorial Guinea is in favour of establishing\r\nmachinery to allow for broad consensus in the decisions\r\ntaken by that body. We therefore support the arguments of\r\nthose who believe that there is a need for an increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe believe that, as others have said, exercise of the\r\nveto should evolve towards mechanisms that will make its\r\nuse more objective. The United Nations should also keep in\r\nmind the fact that the cooperation that will make\r\nsustainable economic development possible in the\r\ndeveloping countries is not just an option; it is an\r\nimperative, if we wish to eradicate the poverty and\r\ndestitution that breed violence and socio-political instability\r\nin many countries and regions of the world.\r\nPresent-day Equatorial Guinea has learnt the hard\r\nlesson of what it means to live in democracy and pluralism\r\nin a difficult socio-economic climate. Therefore, we\r\nbelieve that the preservation of peace and stability and the\r\nfostering of democracy are closely linked to the right of\r\nall the world’s peoples to development.\r\nFor that reason, Equatorial Guinea is concerned\r\nabout the fate that the resolutions adopted at four\r\nimportant world summit meetings of recent years — the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment at Rio de Janeiro, the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development at Copenhagen, the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women at Beijing and the World Summit\r\nfor Children at New York — can expect at the hands of\r\nthe international community. Are we once more going to\r\nfail to fulfil the hopes of our peoples, who had rejoiced\r\nto see the Organization take such salutary initiatives? The\r\ndebt problem remains unresolved, although timid steps\r\nhave recently been taken by the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund.\r\nWhere my country’s domestic affairs are concerned,\r\nwe are building a participatory democracy founded on the\r\npeople, by the people and for the people. Thus, our\r\ndevelopment policy is concentrated on the welfare of our\r\ncitizens. Indeed, within that approach the Government of\r\nEquatorial Guinea is pursuing a programme to promote\r\nhuman rights, with the technical and financial assistance\r\nof the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. In this\r\nconnection, a number of courses and seminars are being\r\noffered for public order and security personnel as well as\r\nfor administrative and judicial authorities responsible for\r\nlaw and order.\r\nWe are daily and progressively enhancing the degree\r\nof democratization of State political structures at the rural\r\ncommunity, municipal, parliamentary and governmental\r\nlevels to facilitate transition.\r\nIn the economic sphere our efforts are directed to\r\nreforms that will be an impetus to sustainable\r\ndevelopment that can improve the standard of living of\r\nour population. Nevertheless, we must note here my\r\ncountry’s concern at a trend in the international\r\ncommunity to erect barriers that hinder the efforts being\r\nmade by many developing countries to harness the\r\nresources needed for development.\r\nIn recent years, in fact, we have witnessed a\r\ncontradictory phenomenon: on the pretext of calling for\r\nthe restoration of unquestioned principles of democracy\r\nand respect for human rights, many developing peoples\r\nare being deprived of the resources that will enable them\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nto meet their basic needs. The donor community must, once\r\nand for all, learn to distinguish between the demands of\r\ncertain selfish political interests and the aspirations of\r\npeoples to freedom, democracy and development.\r\nIn the case of Equatorial Guinea, our aspirations to\r\nconsolidate a State based on the rule of law, democracy and\r\ndevelopment are held hostage to certain intransigent and\r\nradical political groups that are deliberately flooding the\r\ninternational community with disinformation that runs\r\ncounter to my country’s present-day socio-political realities.\r\nFor a number of years now, either out of ignorance or\r\nbecause of vested interests, the donor community has\r\nwielded the weapon of economic blockade, which has made\r\nit impossible to establish democracy on a sure footing in a\r\nnumber of countries.\r\nHowever, we are pleased to inform the Assembly that\r\nour ideals of peace, republican order and healthy social\r\ncoexistence have enabled Equatorial Guinea today to attract\r\nworld interest. Foreign investment is increasing at a rapid\r\nrate, cooperation with friendly countries and international\r\neconomic institutions is growing and economic growth will\r\nexceed 7 per cent by the end of this year. We believe that\r\nultimately Equatorial Guinea will be able to lay the\r\nfoundation for the country’s overall development in all\r\nareas.\r\nWe would therefore like to take this opportunity to\r\nappeal to the international community gathered here to\r\njudge Equatorial Guinea by what is actually happening\r\nthere, and thus to confirm the objective reality of our\r\nmovement towards progress and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Prakash Chandra Lohani. I invite him to make\r\nhis statement.\r\nMr. Lohani (Nepal): On behalf of my delegation and\r\non my own behalf, I should like at the outset to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his unanimous election to\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly, and to express my happiness at seeing a fellow\r\nAsian, from Malaysia, with which my country enjoys the\r\nbest of relations, guiding our deliberations. I pledge to him\r\nthe full cooperation of my delegation. I wish also to thank\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for having guided the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.\r\nMy profound appreciation and gratitude also go to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\ntireless efforts in quest of a world of peace, progress,\r\njustice and humanity.\r\nThe past five decades have seen the United Nations\r\nstriving to fulfil its Charter objectives. Yet peace and\r\nprosperity — mankind’s highest dream — remain\r\nunrealized. Conflicts, enormous cruelty, poverty, hunger\r\nand, of late, population and environmental problems, have\r\nbeen relentlessly on the rise. The United Nations, which\r\nhas limited resources at its disposal and is thus ill-\r\nprepared to deal with such situations, has become the\r\ntarget of increasing public criticism. The tendency to\r\nfocus on the Organization’s set-backs while ignoring its\r\nrecord of real and substantive success threatens to\r\nundermine the raison d’être of the United Nations.\r\nThose formidable odds notwithstanding, the world\r\nbody has achieved a great deal of success in the field of\r\npeace, democracy and human rights. It has many recent\r\nachievements to its credit, in Namibia, Mozambique,\r\nCambodia, Haiti and El Salvador, to name but a few.\r\nThanks to the efforts of the United Nations, the hope for\r\nstability and democracy has been a living reality in those\r\ncountries.\r\nThe presence of the United Nations Interim Force in\r\nLebanon, the United Nations Disengagement Observer\r\nForce and the United Nations Truce Supervision\r\nOrganization continues to make a difference in the Middle\r\nEast. Similarly, the United Nations has exerted efforts to\r\nkeep and mediate peace in many countries of Asia,\r\nAfrica, Europe and Latin America through use of its good\r\noffices and through peacekeeping operations. In spite of\r\nperceived setbacks suffered by the Organization in some\r\npeacekeeping operations, which were undermanned and\r\nlacked clear-cut mandates, we must not forget the real\r\ngood that has been achieved through the prevention of\r\nfurther genocides, the provision of massive humanitarian\r\nrelief and paving the way for political settlements.\r\nA year ago, many world leaders gathered here to\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations. With a deep sense of optimism, they took stock\r\nof the past and present performance of the Organization,\r\nas they also pondered the future course that it may have\r\nto traverse. They reaffirmed their faith in the principles\r\nand purposes of the United Nations Charter, renewed their\r\ncommitment to the world body and pledged their support\r\nto enable the Organization to come to grips with new\r\nrealities and challenges. No doubt the fiftieth anniversary\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nunderlined the need to reactivate the United Nations as the\r\ncentrepiece of international relations, thereby further\r\ndeepening our hopes in the world body.\r\nNepal takes comfort in the fact that the Dayton peace\r\nprocess has provided the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nwith a chance to realize their long-cherished dream of a\r\npeaceful homeland. The recently concluded elections, we\r\nhope, will contribute to a lasting peace in the Balkans, and\r\nwe take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to all\r\nwho contributed to this election process. We are equally\r\nhappy to be part of this peace process through our\r\ncontribution of civilian police monitors to the International\r\nPolice Task Force and the United Nations Transitional\r\nAdministration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\r\nSirmium, under the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. We hope that the next local elections will also\r\nbe held peacefully.\r\nLast year in this Hall I said that the peace process in\r\nthe Middle East had become irreversible. That is still the\r\nview of Nepal, but the recent aggravation of the situation,\r\ninvolving heavy loss of lives and consequent negative\r\nimplications for peace, has given us deep concern. It is my\r\nearnest hope that the recent Washington summit meeting\r\nbetween Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat\r\nwill restore trust between the two sides and be instrumental\r\nin the immediate resumption of serious negotiations within\r\nthe Middle East peace process.\r\nMore than any other country, the landlocked country\r\nof Afghanistan has been a victim of the cold war, and the\r\nAfghan people are still suffering from its far-reaching\r\nconsequences. We hope that peace prevails in that country.\r\nNepal, however, was deeply concerned at the flagrant\r\nviolation of the United Nations sanctuary.\r\nWe believe that United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations are indispensable in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Nepal has been a major\r\ntroop-contributing country to peacekeeping missions of the\r\nUnited Nations. Over the years we have participated in\r\nvarious peacekeeping operations with a total of 30,000\r\ntroops and hundreds of civilian police. Our commitment to\r\nUnited Nations peace initiatives continues undiminished.\r\nNepal supports ongoing efforts for the establishment\r\nof a rapidly deployable Headquarters team in the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations of the United\r\nNations Secretariat, within the framework of a system of\r\nstand-by arrangements to enhance the rapid response\r\ncapabilities of the United Nations — a system to which\r\nNepal has made a stand-by commitment to provide up to\r\n2,000 troops and 200 police monitors. Work on such a\r\nHeadquarters team should proceed in a transparent\r\nmanner and involve all interested Member States,\r\nparticularly troop-contributing nations. We believe that it\r\nshould be composed of staff recruited by the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe United Nations is unfortunately beset with a\r\nchronic financial crisis, which has seriously impaired the\r\nOrganization’s ability to perform well. Despite the year-\r\nlong meetings of the High-level Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations,\r\nthe financial health of the Organization is still precarious,\r\nand cross-funding of the regular budget from the\r\npeacekeeping account is becoming almost the rule rather\r\nthan the exception. The continuation of such practice,\r\nwhich invariably results in late reimbursements to the\r\ntroop-contributing countries, is detrimental to the rapid\r\ndeployment capability expected of the United Nations.\r\nThe capacity of the United Nations to plan and execute\r\npeacekeeping missions will be greatly undermined if the\r\npresent financial crisis persists. Without a secure financial\r\nbase, the international community cannot expect the\r\nUnited Nations to play the role demanded of it in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nModern peacekeeping missions, involving complex\r\nintra-State conflicts combined with massive humanitarian\r\nrelief operations, expose peacekeepers to an\r\nunprecedented level of danger. It is therefore only fitting\r\nthat those brave harbingers of peace who are put in\r\nharm’s way be treated on an equal footing by the United\r\nNations. We hope that a just system of death and\r\ndisability compensation, as mandated by the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, will be established\r\nsoon.\r\nFor Nepal, the recent adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nis a landmark in the history of nuclear non-proliferation\r\nand arms control. We hope that it is the culmination of\r\nour efforts to ban nuclear testing once and for all. We\r\nbelieve that the conclusion of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty brings us a step closer to our\r\ndream of a nuclear-weapon-free world. It is precisely for\r\nthat reason that Nepal supported the Treaty, to which I\r\nput my signature yesterday on behalf of my country.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is only\r\na partial fulfilment of our Treaty commitment to pursue\r\nin good faith the goal of the total elimination of nuclear\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nweapons. With the adoption of the Treaty, it has become\r\nmore urgent than ever that we seriously consider other\r\npriority issues of nuclear disarmament in a practicable,\r\ntime-bound framework. In this regard, Nepal wishes to\r\nunderline its support for the programme of action recently\r\nput forward by 28 non-aligned and neutral countries for the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons through a phased\r\nprogramme.\r\nIn recent times, substantial progress has been made in\r\nthe creation and expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones.\r\nThe Treaty of Bangkok and the Treaty of Pelindaba have\r\nestablished South-East Asia and the continent of Africa,\r\nrespectively, as nuclear-weapon-free zones. Indeed, these\r\nare steps, in the best tradition of the Treaties of Tlatelolco\r\nand Rarotonga, that could contribute greatly to the cause of\r\nnuclear disarmament and the global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. We earnestly hope that efforts will be\r\nintensified in the Middle East and in our own region of\r\nSouth Asia so that the goal of nuclear-weapon-free zones\r\nbecomes a reality in those regions as well.\r\nWe are of the view that our efforts towards the goal\r\nof total nuclear disarmament must be matched by efforts to\r\nachieve the non-proliferation of other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We therefore fully support measures aimed at\r\nimposing a total ban on chemical, biological and other\r\ninhumane weapons, including the production, sale and\r\nexport of anti-personnel landmines. In this regard, I am\r\nglad to say that Nepal is now at the final stage of\r\ncompleting the necessary constitutional process in order to\r\nratify the chemical weapons Convention, which we have\r\nalready signed.\r\nAs host to the United Nations Regional Centre for\r\nPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, my\r\ndelegation wishes to emphasize the need for institutional\r\narrangements for the strengthening of the World\r\nDisarmament Campaign. The Kathmandu Centre has\r\ncontributed to international, regional and subregional\r\ndialogue aimed at transparency and confidence-building in\r\nthe areas of disarmament and security.\r\nIn his annual report on the work of the United\r\nNations, the Secretary-General notes that the past year\r\nwitnessed a determined effort by the international\r\ncommunity to take action to end the scourge of terrorism.\r\nI would like to reaffirm the commitment of Nepal to the\r\nDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate International\r\nTerrorism adopted by the General Assembly two years ago.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is considered\r\nnecessary to make that crucial organ of the United\r\nNations more reflective of contemporary realities. We\r\nagree that any expansion of the Security Council must\r\naccommodate the interests and concerns of the bulk of the\r\ntotal membership, to redress the existing imbalance and\r\nanomalous representation. Any agreed formula for\r\nexpansion, in our view, must take into account the issue\r\nof equitable global representativity. The selection of the\r\nmembers of an expanded Security Council should be\r\nguided by the contribution of Member States to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nHaving said that, I want to emphasize that since the\r\nSecurity Council is the principal instrument of the\r\ninternational community in the area of collective security,\r\nno expansion or reform should diminish in any way its\r\ncapacity for prompt and effective action to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe establishment of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round\r\nhas made it clear that no country can ignore the\r\nglobalization process, which is gaining tremendous\r\nmomentum. At the same time, the acceleration of this\r\nprocess of global economic integration has failed to\r\nnarrow the gap between the developed and the developing\r\ncountries. The economic situation of many countries of\r\nAfrica and the least developed countries is further\r\ndeteriorating, and those countries are being marginalized\r\nbecause of unfavourable conditions prevailing in the\r\nglobal market in the trade of their exportable products.\r\nFurthermore, those countries lack national capacity in\r\nterms of technology and product development capability\r\nand also face various tariff and non-tariff barriers to their\r\nexports abroad.\r\nThe situation of the landlocked developing countries\r\namong the least developed countries is further exacerbated\r\nby the high costs associated with the production and\r\ntransportation of their exportable commodities and their\r\ndifficulty in maintaining the tight delivery schedules\r\ndemanded by the global market. Without direct access to\r\nthe sea and given the absence of a significant market base\r\nwithin their boundaries, those landlocked countries cannot\r\noffer any of the comparative advantages so essential to\r\nattracting foreign investment. Additional financial\r\nresources and the transfer of appropriate technology,\r\naccompanied by concrete measures to offset those built-in\r\nhandicaps, are the bare minimum requirements. We\r\nexpect that the WTO ministerial meeting at Singapore\r\nwill take this reality into account and ensure that the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nproducts of the least developed countries are given free and\r\nunrestricted access to world markets in order to facilitate\r\nthe integration of those countries into the liberalizing and\r\nglobalizing world economy.\r\nIt is with great distress that the developing countries,\r\nand in particular the least developed countries, witness the\r\nsteep decline in the resources of United Nations operational\r\nactivities for development. The least developed countries\r\nneed the enhanced support of those agencies more than\r\never, since most of them have embarked on far-reaching\r\nreforms. In the absence of the flows of direct foreign\r\ninvestment now available to many developing countries, the\r\nleast developed countries that lack basic physical\r\ninfrastructure and material resources have nowhere else to\r\nturn. The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system\r\nengaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to\r\nthe least developed countries, particularly the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), need to be supplemented adequately by the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and regional financial\r\ninstitutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and\r\nsocial situation of the least developed countries.\r\nThe solidarity of the support received from the\r\nrepresentatives of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nGroup of 77 during the recently concluded ministerial\r\nmeeting of least developed countries is an expression of\r\nunderstanding and an acknowledgment of the responsibility\r\nof the international community to the least developed\r\ncountries. We are confident that the emphasis given by the\r\nleaders of the Group of Seven at the Lyon Summit on the\r\nneed to assist the least developed countries and to integrate\r\nthem in the global economy will be backed by concrete\r\nactions.\r\nSouth-South cooperation is another important\r\ncomponent of international economic cooperation that\r\nshould be further explored and promoted. The Government\r\nof Costa Rica deserves our appreciation for its generous\r\noffer to host a South-South conference on finance, trade\r\nand investment in January next year.\r\nIn recent years we have witnessed a decline in the\r\neconomic conditions of more and more people, especially\r\nthose from the developing countries, who now comprise a\r\npopulation of 1.3 billion people living in poverty. The\r\nDeclaration of the year 1996 as the International Year for\r\nthe Eradication of Poverty and the Declaration of the first\r\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty,\r\nbeginning in 1997, must be taken seriously if poverty is to\r\nbe eradicated with renewed vigour and dedication. The\r\neradication of poverty must be a priority agenda for all\r\nmultilateral development institutions.\r\nIn this regard, we express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his initiative to establish, through\r\nthe Administrative Committee on Coordination, inter-\r\nagency task forces to oversee coherent implementation by\r\nthe United Nations system of various cross-sectoral issues\r\ncovered in recent major international conferences. It is\r\nheartening to note that one of the task forces, which is on\r\nthe creation of an enabling environment, is chaired by the\r\nWorld Bank. We look forward to the reports of the task\r\nforces, which are expected in April 1997.\r\nWe are confident that the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the Rio Declaration to be held in\r\nJune of next year will be successful in achieving the\r\nobjective of acquiring new and additional resources to\r\nimplement Agenda 21. We urge the developed countries\r\nto honour the commitments they have made at major\r\ninternational conferences, including those at Rio, Cairo,\r\nCopenhagen, Beijing and Istanbul. We are deeply\r\nconcerned at the declining level of official development\r\nassistance to developing countries, in particular the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWe are happy to see that the Framework Convention\r\non Climate Change has entered into force and is being\r\nimplemented effectively. We are at the same time\r\nconcerned about the Convention on Biological Diversity,\r\nwhich has not been ratified by many countries. I am\r\nespecially pleased to say that the Parliament of Nepal has\r\nalready ratified the International Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification.\r\nWe are firmly committed to the Charter obligation\r\nto promote and protect fundamental human rights for all,\r\nwithout distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.\r\nMy delegation is closely following the negotiations that\r\nare taking place in the Third Committee working group\r\nestablished to oversee the recommendations of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women was a\r\nlandmark in reaffirming the equal rights of women, and\r\nfocused our attention on the important aspect of the equal\r\nparticipation of men and women in development\r\nactivities. We in Nepal are serious about implementing\r\nthe outcome of that Conference, with the creation,\r\ninitially, of a separate Ministry of Women and Social\r\nWelfare.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 9 October 1996\r\nPolitical strife, ethnic conflicts and the denial of basic\r\nhuman rights in many parts of the world have resulted in an\r\ninflux of a large number of refugees, mostly women and\r\nchildren. We express our appreciation to the High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees for her untiring and continued\r\nefforts to take care of refugees around the world, despite\r\nthe limited resources at her disposal. The Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\r\ndeserves our special praise for providing\r\nnecessary food and other services to some 100,000\r\nrefugees in the camps in eastern Nepal. His Majesty’s\r\nGovernment of Nepal upholds the right of every refugee\r\nto return to his or her homeland safely and with dignity.\r\nThe Government will make every effort to solve the\r\nproblem of refugees from Bhutan through mutual\r\ndiscussion and understanding.\r\nAs a critical part of our broad policy of peace,\r\ncooperation and friendship with all countries of the world\r\non the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nprinciple of non-alignment, Nepal is pursuing a policy of\r\npromoting regional cooperation and understanding under\r\nthe umbrella of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC). We celebrated the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Association last year. The seven\r\ncountries of the Association are engaged in various areas\r\nof cooperation, including the suppression of terrorism and\r\ndrug abuse, environmental preservation, poverty\r\nalleviation and the promotion of regional trade. It is a fact\r\nthat SAARC is far behind other similar regional\r\ncooperation arrangements, but the countries of the\r\nAssociation, particularly Nepal, are persevering in their\r\ndetermination to develop both the habit and concrete\r\nmeasures of cooperation, understanding and peace among\r\nthe South Asian partners.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.05 p.m.\r\n18\r\n"
