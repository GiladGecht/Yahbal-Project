(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Evariste Marson, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMadagascar.\r\nMr. Marson (Madagascar) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): In common with the speakers preceding me, I\r\nshould like to congratulate you upon your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. We see it not only as a recognition of your\r\npersonal qualities, but also, and above all, the consecration\r\nof the distinguished part played by your country in the\r\ninternational arena. Through your person, the honour that\r\nderives from your election is shared with the member\r\ncountries of the Non-Aligned Movement, which gives us\r\nparticular pride. I would like to assure you of the complete\r\ncooperation and full support of the delegation of\r\nMadagascar, which it is my privilege to lead.\r\nMy congratulations also go to the other members of\r\nthe General Committee, to whom we wish every success in\r\ntheir work.\r\nLastly, I would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral, our warm gratitude for all the efforts that he made\r\nduring his term as President of the Assembly at its fiftieth\r\nsession. I would like to assure him that we followed\r\nclosely and with interest the activities and contacts which\r\nhe undertook on behalf of our Organization and in order\r\nto further its objectives.\r\nThe disappearance of the political and ideological\r\ndivisions arising from the cold war gave birth to hopes\r\nfor greater international security, stability, peace and\r\nprosperity, so that the international community could\r\nhenceforth focus its efforts on the establishment of a just,\r\nequitable and truly multilateral and non-discriminatory\r\ninternational order, and on the strengthening of\r\ncooperation for international development. These hopes,\r\nhowever, not been fulfilled. A feeling of anxiety prevails\r\nin the face of the imbalances, insecurity, tensions and\r\ncontradictions clouding the prospects for peace and\r\neconomic development. The forces of conflict have grown\r\nto dangerous proportions as they have spilled over\r\nfrontiers, and have assumed various forms such as\r\nterrorism, separatism, fundamentalism, intolerance and\r\nxenophobia.\r\nSimilarly, the interdependent world economy\r\ncontinues to be dominated by uncertainty, imbalances and\r\nrecession. Negative economic growth rates, persistent\r\nimbalances in the commercial and financial fields,\r\nincreased transitional or structural unemployment, and an\r\nabsence of coordination in exchange rates and trade\r\npolicies — these are some of the problems connected\r\nwith the system of the developed world which have an\r\nadverse impact on the developing countries. For in fact\r\nthe resources allocated to cooperation for development\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nhave fallen, on the pretext that up to now this has achieved\r\nnothing for the beneficiary countries, including our\r\ncountries in Africa, whose priorities, at both national and\r\ncontinental level, have been to relieve absolute, endemic\r\npoverty, to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, to overcome\r\ndisease and illiteracy, and to meet the needs for housing\r\nand sanitation.\r\nIn this connection, just as we welcomed Habitat II last\r\nJune in Istanbul, we commend the initiative of the Director-\r\nGeneral of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations (FAO) to convene the World Food Summit\r\nnext November in Rome, to sensitize international opinion\r\nto the problem of hunger in the world, thereby reviving\r\ninterest in the subject that has apparently waned.\r\nThus it is clear that the world today is confronted with\r\nurgent social and economic problems which, at the national,\r\nregional and international levels, require efforts and the\r\nimplementation of policies and measures that can provide\r\nurgent solutions. The future of world trade, financial and\r\nmonetary regimes, economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment, as well as human rights, the environment and\r\npopulation in relation to development, are vital issues that\r\ninextricably link the fate and destiny of all countries.\r\nIt is therefore comforting to recall the solemn\r\ncommitment made by the international community on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\non the night of 24 October 1995, to mobilize in the quest\r\nfor peace, security, development and stability. In order to\r\nattain these objectives and successfully discharge the\r\nfunctions assigned to it in the Charter, the United Nations\r\nneeds to be reformed in order to adjust to a world in\r\nconstant change.\r\nWith respect to the increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, the principle is accepted in general, if for\r\nno other reason than to respond to the increase in the\r\nnumber of United Nations Member States. The proposals\r\nput forward in this context are as interesting as they are\r\nvaried, each invoking praiseworthy objectives, depending on\r\none’s viewpoint. Thus the Italian proposal, drawing on the\r\nprinciple established in Article 23 of the Charter, highlights\r\nthe need to favour the geographical regions that are\r\ncurrently under-represented. This comes close to the\r\nconcern of countries such as Madagascar, which wholly\r\nsubscribes to the decision taken by the African summit in\r\nJuly 1996, namely that the Security Council must become\r\nmore representative in nature and reflect the composition of\r\nthe Organization in a new international system, so as to\r\ncorrect the geographical imbalance that now characterizes\r\nit and make it a genuine organ for the execution of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s resolutions.\r\nThe African position gives priority for the time\r\nbeing to an increase in the number of members. both\r\npermanent and non-permanent. This restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council should allocate two new permanent seats\r\nto Africa, three to Asia, two to Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, and one to the European and other States.\r\nWith respect to the post of Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, Madagascar associates itself with the\r\nchorus of all African countries, through the Declaration of\r\nYaoundé, which reaffirmed Africa’s right to a second\r\nterm in the Secretary-General’s post, as has been the\r\npractice since the creation of the Organization.\r\nAccordingly, Madagascar supports the re-election of\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, one of whose main objectives\r\nhas been to identify and elaborate concrete proposals for\r\nthe recovery and development of Africa so as to make the\r\nUnited Nations system’s support to the continent as\r\neffective as possible. In that context, the support of the\r\ninternational community as a whole is a must.\r\nWe take note of the progress achieved in resolving\r\nthe debt problem and in the implementation of the Naples\r\nterms, as well as the recommendations made by the\r\nGroup of Seven summit convened in Lyon in June 1996.\r\nThe developing countries, particularly in Africa, certainly\r\nneed substantial international support, but it is above all\r\nthe responsibility of our leaders and peoples to make the\r\nnecessary changes to create a suitable sociopolitical\r\nclimate for development on a large scale. Thus we have\r\nno choice but to continue to work, by ourselves to begin\r\nwith, to achieve collective self-reliance at the national,\r\nregional and continental levels. For its part, Madagascar,\r\nwhich has just completed its economic policy framework\r\ndocument, hopes in the near future to benefit from\r\nadditional measures from its creditors going beyond the\r\nNaples terms to give a fresh impetus to its development.\r\nIndeed, in today’s world of multidimensional\r\ninterdependence, any failure in development can only\r\nharm us all, rich and poor alike, since poverty is defined\r\nin terms of collective responsibility and the rights of\r\nevery individual.\r\nIn the field of human rights, efforts must be stepped\r\nup to translate into real action the 1992 Declaration on\r\nthe Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic,\r\nReligious and Linguistic Minorities, adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nWith respect to the challenges arising in the Middle\r\nEast, Bosnia and Northern Ireland, we note that we are\r\nadvancing in the right direction. Madagascar is attentively\r\nfollowing the recent phases, particularly as regards the\r\npeace process between Israel and the Palestinians.\r\nMoreover, like all peoples of the world, we reaffirm our\r\nwish to see the peaceful reunification of Korea.\r\nIn the face of the situation obtaining in the Western\r\nSahara after the Security Council’s decision of May 1996,\r\nMadagascar remains concerned.\r\nThe frequent setbacks experienced by the conventional\r\napproach to peacekeeping should persuade us to persevere\r\nin our efforts to prevent conflict and give subregional\r\nstructures responsibility for the maintenance of peace, as\r\nadvocated in the United Nations Secretary-General’s\r\nAgenda for Peace, and as applied by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution.\r\nAgainst this background, the General Assembly should\r\nbe given appropriate powers to have access to mechanisms\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The mechanisms for\r\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts should be strengthened\r\nin the light of the provisions advocated in the Agenda for\r\nPeace. When peace is restored, the role of United Nations\r\nforces as a buffer in international, civil or ethnic conflicts\r\nshould also be strengthened. Madagascar intends to\r\nparticipate concretely in peacekeeping operations. Regional\r\nstructures for conflict resolution, such as those that exist\r\nwithin the United Nations, the Organization of African\r\nUnity and the Non-Aligned Movement, should again be\r\nstrengthened.\r\nFor us, the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution has proved its usefulness in\r\nAfrica in a number of cases, inter alia, through the\r\nintervention of regional units of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Drought and Development\r\n(IGADD), which have operated respectively in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica and in the Sahel. Madagascar fully subscribes to this\r\napproach, as is borne out by its direct involvement in the\r\nmediation process for the settlement of the Comorian\r\nconflict in 1995.\r\nThe signing of the Pelindaba Text of the African\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty this year attests to the\r\nwillingness of the African countries to banish all nuclear\r\nweapons from their soil. Madagascar, faithful to its\r\nprinciples, is now initiating the procedure for accession to\r\nthis Treaty. It is in this connection that Madagascar has\r\njust signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nSimilarly, my country also considers that the extension of\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) is an initial response to the major challenges of our\r\ntime in the area of nuclear proliferation and arms\r\nlimitation.\r\nIn the environmental sphere, after the legitimate\r\nconcerns expressed by Heads of State and Government at\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, energetic\r\nmeasures must be taken through a common commitment\r\nby all countries. There is no need to demonstrate that\r\nenvironmental problems know neither political nor natural\r\nboundaries. Nevertheless, at the domestic level, it must be\r\nemphasized that people are not always sensitive to the\r\nalmost irreconcilable concepts of conservation and\r\nprotection and meeting basic needs (heating, fuel,\r\nfisheries resources, etc.).\r\nIt is in the light of these considerations that\r\nMadagascar has opted for a gradual approach regarding\r\nits accession to international environmental conventions.\r\nThus the country has set up a basic framework for\r\nenvironmental policy, termed the Environmental Charter.\r\nIt has drawn up an environmental programme in three\r\nstages phased over a 15-year period; negotiations for\r\nmulti-donor financing of this programme have just been\r\ncompleted in September in Paris.\r\nWith respect to international conventions,\r\nMadagascar has ratified the main Conventions, including\r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity, the United\r\nNations International Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, the\r\nVienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer,\r\nand the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the\r\nOzone Layer. As it implements these various\r\nConventions, Madagascar wishes to enlist the\r\nparticipatory involvement of its people, and thus apply the\r\nprinciple of “Think globally — act locally”.\r\nLastly, one year after the Beijing Conference and\r\none year after the Copenhagen summit, I would not wish\r\nto conclude without recalling Madagascar’s efforts in the\r\nsocial sphere, as demonstrated by the permanent\r\nstructures within successive Governments for the benefit\r\nof women, children and social problems in general.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, Madagascar,\r\nlike all nations on earth, aspires to a world of peace and\r\nprogress in which the scourges of war, poverty and\r\ndestruction will be banished forever. The United Nations is\r\nthe ideal place to build such a world, provided that all\r\npeoples and all leaders have the necessary political will and\r\ntransform into reality all the promises made. That is the\r\nMalagasy delegation’s ardent hope.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President\r\nof the Republic of Sierra Leone\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nMr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone, His Excellency\r\nMr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabbah: On behalf of my country and on\r\nmy own behalf, I extend to you, Sir, our warmest\r\ncongratulations on your unanimous election as President of\r\nthe fifty-first session of the Assembly. Your election is\r\nindeed a deserving tribute to you personally and to your\r\ngreat country, Malaysia, which, over the years, has been\r\nunflagging in its commitment to the principles and ideals of\r\nthis Organization — the attainment of international peace\r\nand justice. I am confident that your rich diplomatic\r\nexperience, coupled with your fine human qualities, will\r\nenable you to guide the deliberations of this session of the\r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. Permit me, Sir, to\r\nalso take this opportunity to extend my delegation’s\r\ngratitude to your predecessor for having so ably steered the\r\nAssembly’s fiftieth session up to this momentous occasion.\r\nI should like at this point to convey our appreciation\r\nand gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for the dedicated and able manner in which\r\nhe has guided the work of the Organization. In this regard,\r\nwe reaffirm our support for the Organization of African\r\nUnity’s (OAU) declaration on the Secretary-General’s re-\r\nelection. Permit me, Mr. Secretary-General, to convey,\r\nthrough you, to the entire staff of the United Nations our\r\nadmiration for their loyalty and commitment to the\r\nOrganization.\r\nI bring also the greetings and good will of the\r\npeople of Sierra Leone. They have requested me to\r\nconvey our sincere gratitude to the international\r\ncommunity for its support in restoring democracy to our\r\ncountry in March this year. I stand here today as a\r\ntestimony to the right of that people, who in March of\r\nthis year elected their Government and chose their\r\ndestiny. As their leader, I am determined to live up to\r\ntheir high aspirations and expectations. Allow me on this\r\noccasion also to pay tribute to our gallant citizens, many\r\nof whom lost their lives in the process of restoring\r\ndemocracy and constitutional rule to our country.\r\nDespite this great achievement, my country is still\r\nhaunted and tormented by the spectre of ongoing civil\r\nconflict in our country. The rebel war inflicted severe\r\npain and suffering on my people, who had never before\r\nimagined that such a terrible thing could happen to us.\r\nThousands of innocent civilians — men, women and\r\nchildren — lost their lives; others were traumatized, as\r\nwell as physically or psychologically crippled for life; still\r\nothers continue to languish as refugees or displaced\r\npersons in inhospitable camps.\r\nThe Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has no\r\npolitical agenda and no respect for the democratic\r\nprocess. It consistently ignored an invitation to participate\r\nin the recent internationally supervised elections in spite\r\nof numerous appeals and offers of assistance by the\r\nUnited Nations and other intergovernmental organizations.\r\nInstead, it set out to disrupt those elections by unleashing\r\nviolence against the electorates, killing many and\r\nmaiming many more. Thanks to our determination to\r\nrestore democracy in our country, this RUF attempt\r\nfailed, as did its effort to collude with the military junta\r\nand share power in defiance of the democratic process.\r\nThe RUF draws its support from abducted villagers\r\nand rural schoolchildren, including girls aged seven and\r\nolder, and maintains their “loyalty” with the use of drugs\r\nand terror.\r\nThis notwithstanding, my Government entered into\r\npeace negotiations in the spirit of reconciliation, and I am\r\npleased to report that the talks have advanced\r\nconsiderably. In March 1996, just after my assumption of\r\noffice, a ceasefire was agreed upon. In spite of some\r\nincidents, it is still generally holding.\r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to express my sincere thanks to the Secretary-\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the continuing\r\nsupport he has afforded us to in promoting the cause of\r\ndemocratization and the restoration of peace in my country\r\nand, in particular, for his assignment of a Special Envoy,\r\nwhose constructive and enduring role has helped to advance\r\nthe peace process. I should also like to express gratitude to\r\nPresident Henri Konan-Bédié and the Government and\r\npeople of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire for the selfless and\r\npainstaking efforts they have deployed in hosting and\r\nmediating the talks between the Government of Sierra\r\nLeone and the RUF.\r\nAfter protracted and painstaking negotiations that\r\ninvolved extensive Government concessions, including a\r\ngeneral amnesty for all RUF members; an undertaking to\r\nhelp set up a trust fund for the RUF to assist it in\r\ntransforming itself into a political party; the offer of jobs to\r\nthe RUF leader and his followers, including their absorption\r\ninto the army, the police and other government institutions,\r\nthe RUF leader finally indicated his readiness to sign a\r\npeace agreement drafted by the host Government, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire.\r\nHowever, the RUF leader now seems to be unwilling\r\nto honour his commitment to sign the agreement,\r\nmanufacturing various excuses to justify his prevarication.\r\nWe are concerned that continued intransigence and\r\nprevarication by the RUF could precipitate a full-scale\r\nresumption of hostilities, given the increasing level of\r\ndistrust between the two sides. It is therefore time for the\r\ninternational community to act to forestall this potential\r\ncatastrophe by demanding that the RUF sign the peace\r\nagreement without further delay. Failing this, the imposition\r\nof sanctions against it should be considered, including the\r\ndenial of access to the facilities and territories of third\r\ncountries, and the prospect of its arraignment before a war\r\ncrimes tribunal for the serious crimes being perpetrated\r\nagainst innocent civilians.\r\nWhile we persevere in our efforts to bring this conflict\r\nto a peaceful end, I owe it to our people to emphasize the\r\nneed for the continued support of the international\r\ncommunity to help us in the task of rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction. We are encouraged by the outcome of the\r\nrecent round-table conference on Sierra Leone held in\r\nGeneva under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). We take this\r\nopportunity to express our sincere thanks to those countries\r\nthat have pledged generously to assist in our post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. We, for our part,\r\nare determined to rebuild our country with all the energy\r\nand resources we can muster from within our borders. We\r\nhave already embarked on this process, and we are\r\ndetermined to see it through, no matter what sacrifice is\r\nnecessary.\r\nTwo decades ago, the prevailing perception in this\r\nbody was that the end of the cold war would dramatically\r\nreduce the incidence of regional conflicts and thus\r\nenhance international peace and security. Today, however,\r\nthose conflicts appear to have been replaced by civil wars\r\nand ethnic strife, which now pose the greatest challenge\r\nto the peacekeeping and peacemaking capacities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe have witnessed mass horrors in Rwanda and\r\nBurundi, and intense internal strife in Somalia, Liberia\r\nand, to a lesser extent, in my own country. Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Chechnya and the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories all have continued to engage the attention of\r\nthe international community. We call upon the leaders and\r\nactors in those conflicts to renounce violence and to\r\nembark on sincere and serious negotiations with a view to\r\nfinding peaceful solutions. Agreements reached should be\r\nhonoured and respected. The innocent, who are all too\r\noften the victims of such conflicts, cry out for peaceful\r\nresolution.\r\nAs regards the question of the peaceful resolution of\r\nconflicts, of particular concern to my country is the\r\nsituation in Liberia. Consensus has once again emerged\r\nfrom the political dialogue between the various factions,\r\ngiving rise to renewed hopes of a durable peace for that\r\ndevastated country and its people. Full implementation of\r\nthe conditions embodied in the new implementation plan\r\nof the Abuja Agreement, concluded at the recent\r\nEconomic Community of West African States Committee\r\nof Nine summit held in Abuja, Federal Republic of\r\nNigeria, would provide real hope for Liberia. We remain\r\nconfident that this time around, those responsible for the\r\nLiberians’ pain and suffering will find the courage and\r\npatriotism to spare their fellow citizens further violence\r\nand bloodshed. Enough is enough. The defenceless people\r\nof Liberia, especially innocent children, men and women,\r\nhave a right to freedom from violence; they have a right\r\nto life.\r\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa is\r\nalso cause for serious concern. As we watch the cautious\r\nreturn of Rwandan refugees, we hope and pray that the\r\nwounds inflicted by ethnic strife will heal on the platform\r\nof national reconciliation. The ongoing crisis in Burundi\r\nalso poses a challenge to the international community. In\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nthe light of my own country’s recent history, we cannot\r\ncondone the seizure of power by the military from a\r\nconstitutionally elected Government. We call on all\r\nconcerned not to relent in their search for a long-term\r\nsolution to the horrendous crisis. Looking at the broader\r\npicture of tackling such difficulties, we hope that others\r\nwill support the efforts of the Organization of African\r\nUnity to strengthen its Mechanism for the prevention and\r\nresolution of conflicts.\r\nClosely linked to the issue of peace is that of the\r\nprotection of human rights. We reaffirm our faith in justice\r\nand in the dignity and worth of the human person. That is\r\nwhy Sierra Leone fully supports the work of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe commend the work of the Preparatory Committee for\r\nits current efforts aimed at preparing the text of a statute\r\nfor an international criminal court, which will have an\r\nimportant role in the area of massive human rights\r\nviolations, which, notwithstanding the sad lessons of\r\nhistory, continue today in several parts of the world.\r\nWhile political, regional and ethnic conflicts, civil\r\nwars and the menace of armaments — both nuclear and\r\nconventional — are a major concern, Sierra Leone believes\r\nthat the greatest threat to international peace and security\r\ntoday lies in poverty and in economic and social\r\ndeprivation. The nature and complexity of the economic\r\nand social problems that beset Africa are all too familiar to\r\nus. The majority of African countries, including Sierra\r\nLeone, continue to face a myriad of economic and\r\nstructural challenges. Africa has the largest number of least\r\ndeveloped countries and the lowest average per capita\r\nincome in the developing world. In fact, Africa’s overall\r\nliving standards and socio-economic conditions have\r\ndeteriorated considerably since the beginning of this decade.\r\nMost African countries have encountered numerous\r\ndifficulties over the years in their effort to mobilize and\r\ndeploy financial and human resources for economic\r\ndevelopment. The levels of investment have not been\r\nencouraging; nor have the levels of agricultural and mineral\r\noutputs, due in large part to drought, economic\r\ndisincentives, political manipulation and an unfavourable\r\ninternational environment. In many cases, aided and abetted\r\nby ruthless arms merchants, many of us continue to engage\r\nin senseless fratricidal conflicts and the wanton destruction\r\nof the development infrastructure.\r\nWe are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints\r\nfaced by various developed countries, clarification of\r\nforeign aid objectives, revised conditions governing the\r\ngranting of assistance, and the heightened competition\r\namong various regions for aid packages constitute a\r\nserious challenge for developing countries such as mine.\r\nThe ubiquitous debt burden and the debt- servicing levels\r\nin no way help the situation, as they continue to be a\r\nmajor stumbling block on the path of African economic\r\nrecovery and sustainable growth. Overseas development\r\nassistance and resource flows have dwindled to a level\r\nthat gives us cause for concern. The downward trend in\r\nexport commodity prices and the agricultural policies of\r\nsome of the industrialized nations have had a negative\r\nimpact on Africa’s trade in these commodities, the main\r\nsource of income for socio-economic development. In this\r\nconnection, the debt burden that continues to hang over us\r\nhas conspired to frustrate our efforts at economic recovery\r\nand development.\r\nSierra Leone strongly believes that the urgent\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, adopted by the\r\nAssembly on 18 December 1991, is the best hope yet for\r\nsetting Africa on the road to positive sustainable\r\neconomic development. We appreciate the fact that the\r\nbasic tenets of the New Agenda are grounded on the\r\nprinciples of shared responsibility and global partnership\r\nbetween Africa and the rest of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nVirtually all Member States of the first and second\r\nworlds represented in the Assembly have experienced, at\r\none time or another, the same or similar problems in their\r\nstruggle for national unity and economic prosperity; we\r\nread about them in the cold pages of history.\r\nUnfortunately for us Africans, our economic and other\r\nproblems — teething problems, if I may say so — are\r\ntransmitted live, instantly, by satellite to television sets\r\nacross the globe.\r\nLooking at current economic, social and political\r\nconditions on our continent, including the atrocities meted\r\nout to our own kith and kin, one is inclined to lose hope\r\nin the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBut the thrust of my message today is simple: I\r\nappeal to the international community not to abandon\r\nAfrica. Even though we may be on our knees in anguish,\r\nI firmly believe that there is hope for Africa, that Africa\r\nand its people have the ability and capacity to overcome\r\nnatural and self-inflicted constraints and to achieve\r\npolitical stability as well as reasonable economic\r\nprosperity. We have recently witnessed many changes on\r\nthe continent that lend credence to Africa’s genuine\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\ncommitment to the New Agenda for Africa and to other\r\nplans for economic and political stability. Hence, there is\r\nstill hope for Africa. My presence here is symbolic of that\r\nhope. In spite of a rebel war that still hangs over my\r\ncountry, and in spite of attempts to frustrate the will of the\r\npeople to choose their destiny freely and in a democratic\r\nmanner, Sierra Leoneans opted for democracy. We are\r\ndetermined to achieve genuine peace as well as the\r\nobjectives we have set for ourselves, which are\r\ncommensurate with the enormous sacrifices our people have\r\nmade.\r\nI am confident, therefore, that the political dialogue to\r\nensure the advent of good governance, which has begun in\r\nearnest in most countries throughout the continent, will\r\ncontinue. Given the proper chance to grow, our new and\r\nemerging democracies will gradually bear fruit, and our\r\ndistressed nations will once again be guided by lofty\r\ndemocratic ideals in an environment of peace, security and\r\nstability. African democracy will eventually be the order of\r\nthe day. For these gains to be fully realized, it is therefore\r\nimperative that the international community continue to\r\nplay a catalytic role in Africa’s development.\r\nIn virtually every policy statement, every address and\r\nevery current discussion about the United Nations there is\r\nsome reference to reform in our Organization. We are\r\nencouraged by the work of various intergovernmental\r\nbodies to develop constructive ideas for reform. However,\r\nreform should not be seen only in terms of the so-called\r\nbloated bureaucracy of the Secretariat, to be used as a\r\nscapegoat for not meeting our obligations towards the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn the view of the Government of Sierra Leone, we\r\nneed a systemic reform; a reform of the political decision-\r\nmaking process in the Organization; a reform of some of\r\nthe archaic methods and practices in the institutions that\r\ncompose the United Nations system. Let us begin by\r\ntransforming, indeed transferring, the principles and\r\nconcepts of democratic governance, empowerment, power-\r\nsharing, decentralization and pluralism that we espouse for\r\nnation States to the international community at large. In this\r\nregard, Africa should be entitled to play its role in the\r\nSecurity Council, the primary decision-making organ of this\r\nOrganization, particularly in relation to international peace\r\nand stability.\r\nIn pursuit of this objective, we would like to recall\r\nand support the position expressed by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, that is, if there is no agreement on other\r\ncategories of membership, expansion should take place, for\r\nthe time being, only in the non-permanent category. I\r\nshould like to note in this regard that the proposal of\r\nItaly, among others, deserves careful consideration, as it\r\naims at increasing the participation of all Member States\r\nin the Council, in particular medium-sized and small\r\ncountries, and it would improve its representative and\r\ndemocratic character.\r\nFor our part, we affirm our faith in the United\r\nNations, which, in spite of its defects, remains the\r\ngreatest hope for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, and for the promotion of the economic and\r\nsocial advancement of all peoples in our interdependent\r\nworld.\r\nWho needs the United Nations? First, it is an\r\nimportant institution. Furthermore, it is an effective\r\ninternational mechanism when used properly. Some of us\r\nrepresented in the Assembly may need it more than\r\nothers, but we all do, in one way or another.\r\nLet us therefore rededicate ourselves to its principles\r\nand objectives, and, in the words of the Charter, make it\r\nat least\r\n“a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\r\nthe attainment of these common ends”.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Sierra\r\nLeone for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Sibusiso Barnabas\r\nDlamini, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland.\r\nThe Right Honourable Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, The\r\nRight Honourable Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): I bring with me from the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland the greetings and good wishes of\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi\r\nand Queen Mother, the Government and the whole Swazi\r\nnation to our friends and fellow Members here at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland, may I\r\ncongratulate you most sincerely, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of this fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that the wisdom, experience\r\nand diplomatic skills you bring to this office will ensure\r\nsuccess in the important business before us.\r\nSwaziland would also like to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who presided\r\nwith such skill over the historic fiftieth session.\r\nI should also like to record the deep gratitude of the\r\nSwazi nation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, and to the staff of the Secretariat for their\r\nuntiring efforts in meeting the many challenges that face\r\nour Organization as we prepare to enter a new millennium.\r\nOne year ago, His Majesty King Mswati III joined\r\nother leaders from around the world to celebrate the first 50\r\nyears of achievement of the United Nations, to set out a\r\nvision for the future and to reaffirm the commitment of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland to the principles set out in our\r\nOrganization’s founding Charter.\r\nSwaziland recognizes the vital role the Organization\r\nhas played throughout its history, and we remain convinced\r\nthat the United Nations represents humankind’s best hope\r\nof providing global leadership and guidance towards\r\nachieving the conditions of universal peace and security that\r\nwill allow equitable and sustainable development for all our\r\npeoples.\r\nLast year’s occasion was seen by many as an\r\nopportunity to review the internal mechanisms of our\r\nOrganization and to call for greater efficiency,\r\naccountability and representation in all areas of its work.\r\nSwaziland is therefore encouraged by the progress\r\nbeing made by the various working groups established by\r\nthe General Assembly, in particular progress towards the\r\nreform of the Secretariat and Security Council. We will\r\ncontinue to support all initiatives that bring about a more\r\nefficient and cost-effective Organization.\r\nAs the Organization’s membership has increased\r\nover the years, so has the scope of its operations and\r\nresponsibilities. It is an unfortunate fact that our will to\r\nface these new challenges has not been met by a\r\ncorresponding desire to pay for the means to overcome\r\nthem. We are faced with a stark choice between whether\r\nto accept new responsibilities and the bill they attract, or\r\nadmit that we lack the financial commitment to meet\r\nthem.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has always believed in\r\nthe principle of meeting our financial responsibilities in\r\nfull and on time. We fully endorse the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to our fellow Members to do likewise, so\r\nthat the United Nations can have the resources at its\r\ndisposal to perform the tasks that we expect of it.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been most\r\nencouraged by recent developments towards the eventual\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction. The\r\nnegotiations leading up to and the signing of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by an\r\noverwhelming majority brings great credit to our\r\nOrganization and to those whose hard work made it\r\npossible.\r\nWhile we recognize and are deeply grateful for the\r\nhumanitarian assistance provided to Africa by the United\r\nNations, we believe that the Organization needs to do\r\nmore to strike at the causes of the hardship suffered by so\r\nmany Africans who find themselves caught up in the\r\nhorror of war.\r\nOne important issue concerns the flow of weapons\r\ninto Africa from many other parts of the world. It is a\r\nsimple fact in today’s world that arms, ammunition and\r\narmaments are too easily accessible to those with the\r\nmeans to procure them. The duration of conflict situations\r\ncan be limited by the non-availability of the weapons of\r\nwar.\r\nIt has been suggested that the first action of a truly\r\ncaring world in response to a conflict situation should be\r\nto cut off the supply of arms to all involved, and that the\r\nfinal responsibility of a caring world towards a country\r\nthat has endured conflict is the clearance of the last\r\nlandmine.\r\nThis is a lesson we learned very late in recent\r\ndisasters such as the Bosnian crisis and in Rwanda. We\r\nhave clearly not learned from it in other situations around\r\nthe world. Let us hope that the global community\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nrepresented here can move faster in future to impose\r\nlimitations on man’s ability to harm his fellow man.\r\nWe in Africa recognize the need to be prepared for\r\nimmediate reaction to our continent’s problems and are\r\ntaking the necessary steps to abide by the principle of\r\n“African solutions to Africa’s problems”.\r\nThe example of Burundi shows our continent’s desire\r\nto heed the warning signs and to ward off potential\r\ndisasters before they happen.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland commends the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and those individual\r\ncountries whose diplomacy and actions have prevented the\r\nsituation from spiralling out of control. The Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity has also been at the forefront in attempting\r\nto resolve crisis situations in Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and\r\nLiberia.\r\nWe join the rest of the world in applauding these\r\nefforts, and we continue to offer our encouragement and\r\nsupport in bringing about an end to the suffering of those\r\ninvolved. The OAU represents the hope of all Africans for\r\nunity, peace and development, and deserves to be supported\r\nstrongly by the rest of the world.\r\nOn a subregional basis, and in the field of economic\r\nand trade cooperation, the Kingdom of Swaziland is a\r\nmember of the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\r\nAfrica.\r\nSADC has recently expanded its mandate to include a\r\nnew Organ on Politics, Defence and Security. This is an\r\nattempt to provide a mechanism by which member States\r\ncan call for advice and support from other members in the\r\nevent of national and international issues that might threaten\r\nthe stability of the whole subregion.\r\nThe new organ is founded on the principle of the\r\nrecognition of the sovereignty of independent States and is\r\nintended precisely to identify potential problems, in\r\nwhatever context, and to look for solutions to persistent\r\nconcerns in our area. The organ provides an example of our\r\nsubregion’s commitment to peace and stability within and\r\namong our member States as essential conditions for the\r\ndevelopment of our separate nations. It deserves the support\r\nand encouragement of the rest of the world.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been heartened by\r\nthe various initiatives of the United Nations towards an\r\nimprovement in global socio-economic conditions.\r\nThe establishment of an international criminal court\r\nis welcomed by Swaziland as a necessary extension of\r\njustice in cases where national jurisdiction does not apply.\r\nThis step relies for its success on the political will of all\r\nStates and requires the widest possible representation of\r\nMembers in its operation. Similarly, the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland welcomes the move by the United Nations to\r\naddress the increasing threat posed to civil society by\r\norganized crime and money-laundering.\r\nOf particular danger to Swaziland in this regard is\r\nthe increase in traffic across our borders and abuse among\r\nour people of illegal drugs and related substances. This is\r\na relatively new and alarming phenomenon for our\r\nKingdom and undermines our efforts to promote national\r\ndevelopment. We therefore welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on promoting international cooperation\r\nin the fight against the illegal drug trade, and we are\r\nappreciative of the high priority this subject attracts in the\r\nrelevant agencies of the Organization.\r\nThis effort has been matched by a similar initiative\r\nwithin our own SADC organization to encourage cross-\r\nborder cooperation among our security personnel and to\r\nagree on measures among the Member States to contain\r\nthis potentially devastating problem.\r\nIt has been acknowledged that the continent of\r\nAfrica presents particular challenges in the quest for\r\nsustainable development and a decent standard of living\r\nfor all its peoples.\r\nWith this in mind, the Kingdom of Swaziland gave\r\nan enthusiastic welcome to the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative on the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. It was hoped that\r\nthe Agenda would provide fresh impetus for change and\r\nfor the good of the people of Africa, but for many\r\nreasons this remains an elusive dream. While social and\r\neconomic conditions in many areas of the continent\r\ncontinue to decline, we are comforted by the fact that\r\nefforts are being made to identify the reasons why so\r\nmany commitments continue to remain on paper and why\r\nsome are implemented, but slowly.\r\nSwaziland echoes the call from all African brothers\r\nand sisters for real commitment to the New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa so that future generations of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nAfricans will not be locked into the same spiral of despair\r\nthat many people on our continent find themselves in.\r\nIt is to avoid being caught in this very situation that\r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland has always worked hard to\r\nensure that our people are at the centre of all our national\r\ndevelopment efforts. To this end the Kingdom frequently\r\nconsults with all its people on all the most important\r\ndevelopment issues. Each and every Swazi has a voice and\r\nis given the opportunity to express his or her views on the\r\nmatters that affect them.\r\nIn recent times we have consulted in this way with the\r\nnation on our political direction and our economic\r\npriorities. Currently we are addressing ourselves to a review\r\nof our Constitution.\r\nA constitutional review committee has been\r\nestablished, representing the widest range of views, which\r\nwill now consult with the nation and gather the people’s\r\nwishes on the way they would like to see their country\r\nmanaged. All will be free to contribute, and we will abide\r\nby the views of the majority. The end result will be the\r\nKingdom’s defining document, and it will, in a very real\r\nsense, be the people’s Constitution. This current\r\nconsultation exercise is the latest example of our nation’s\r\nadherence to the principle of rule through consensus, and it\r\nis one that has served us well throughout our history.\r\nIn a world where the definition of such concepts as\r\nhuman rights and democracy can vary so greatly and is so\r\ndependent on timing and circumstances, the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland has had a consistent vision of what is really\r\nrequired of its rulers by its people: to provide the freedom\r\nand opportunity for all Swazis to offer an opinion on the\r\ngreat matters of the day and for our leaders to be bound by\r\nthe wishes of the majority. We owe our survival as a nation\r\nto this principle, and we will continue to abide by it for as\r\nlong as it suits us.\r\nFor the past three years the Kingdom of Swaziland has\r\ngiven its support to efforts by the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan to have its case presented to the General Assembly.\r\nAs the world concentrates its attention on the great social\r\nchallenges facing us all today, we must surely acknowledge\r\nthe need to engage all peoples of the world in a truly global\r\neffort to overcome them. Indeed, the Charter speaks of the\r\nrequirement for universality in our Organization so that all\r\nmay feel represented here.\r\nThe 23 million people of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan believe they can contribute significantly to this\r\neffort and have already shown that they are willing to do\r\nso in many areas of expertise, including poverty\r\nalleviation, private enterprise development and\r\nhumanitarian assistance. Many countries have\r\nacknowledged this will on the part of the Government and\r\nthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and the\r\nrecent political developments in Taiwan have encouraged\r\nmany others to support our call.\r\nWe are positive that a lasting solution can be found\r\nto resolve this question. Hence, we support the idea of the\r\nGeneral Assembly establishing an ad hoc committee to\r\naddress the question of the readmittance of the Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan into the United Nations.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to place its\r\nconfidence in the United Nations and in the principles on\r\nwhich it was founded. We remain deeply grateful for the\r\nassistance we have received over the years from its\r\nagencies, and we look forward to many more years of\r\ncooperation and support.\r\nFor 51 years, and despite the many obstacles in its\r\npath, the United Nations has presented to successive\r\ngenerations the only chance for a united, global approach\r\nto the world’s problems. We are reassured by the\r\ninitiatives for reform in the Organization and look\r\nforward to a new dynamism and efficiency in its\r\noperations.\r\nI am charged by His Majesty King Mswati III, by\r\nHer Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Queen Mother, and by\r\nthe Government and the people of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland, with proclaiming the renewal of our\r\ncommitment to the founding Charter of the Organization.\r\nWe ask for Almighty God’s blessing on its leaders and\r\nthose who work here, to give them the wisdom and\r\ndirection they need to carry out their vital tasks on behalf\r\nof all humankind.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland for his statement.\r\nThe Right Honourable Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nAddress by The Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius.\r\nThe Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ramgoolam (Mauritius): I join all those who\r\nhave gone before me in congratulating you, Sir, on behalf\r\nof Mauritius, on your accession to the office of President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. I also thank\r\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for his skilful\r\nstewardship of the fiftieth session.\r\nHearing and reading the speeches of world leaders to\r\nthis Assembly, I am struck by the extraordinary degree of\r\nunanimity between them — how much we seem to agree in\r\nprinciple but how little on the right course of action; on the\r\nnecessity of diplomacy and discussion as the primary path\r\nto peace; on the necessity of according to every man,\r\nwoman and child the fundamental rights and freedoms\r\nwhich this Organization has, over the years, done so much\r\nto establish; on the necessity of providing equal\r\nopportunities for men, women and children in all our\r\nsocieties; on the necessity of protecting the environment;\r\nand on the need to ensure that mankind moves forward\r\ntogether on the path of development.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIn all these noble and commendable aims we are\r\nunited. However, we often seem to suffer from a paralysis\r\nwhen it comes to actual implementation of these good\r\nintentions.\r\nThis Organization was the response of the human race\r\nto the catastrophic experiences of two world wars and to\r\nscientific discoveries and inventions which confronted us\r\nwith unprecedented choices. It was an expression of faith\r\nin the power of human beings to be rational in the face of\r\nthese choices and to choose the paths of peace and progress\r\ninstead of war and destruction.\r\nBut sometimes its voice has seemed very faint and\r\nfar off in the midst of the terrible troubles that have\r\nafflicted us since then. Some have begun to mutter of the\r\nineffectiveness of the institution and to complain of the\r\ncost. I am convinced that those criticisms do not begin to\r\nexpress the whole truth about the work that is done by\r\nthis Organization. We are embarked upon a great and\r\nnecessary experiment, and that is why the work of the\r\nSecretary-General is so important. Here I should like to\r\npay tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\r\ncontribution has been so valuable in recent years. It is\r\nparticularly appropriate that this great office should be\r\nfilled, as we move into the next millennium, by a\r\nrepresentative of Africa, for Africa remains the great\r\nintransigent challenge which the world has scarcely yet\r\nbegun to face. Only through the renewed and concerted\r\ndetermination of this Organization and the vision of\r\ncooperation and mutual responsibility which it represents\r\nis there any hope of successfully meeting the\r\nextraordinary difficulties which the next century will\r\nbring.\r\nDecade after decade, many of the nations of Africa\r\nhave seen their efforts at development frustrated by\r\nnatural and man-made disasters, poor governance and a\r\nhostile international environment. Foreign aid has not had\r\nthe desired impact on the progress of these countries, and\r\nthe poorer nations have accumulated huge and\r\nunmanageable debt which they labour, with inadequate\r\ntools, to support.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, of the 36 poorest countries\r\nin the world, as classified by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme in the human development\r\nindex, 29 are in Africa. The majority of them have per\r\ncapita incomes lower than they were 20 years ago. The\r\ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa last year attracted only 3\r\nper cent of the foreign direct investment into the\r\ndeveloping world, compared to 20 per cent for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean and 59 per cent for East Asia\r\nand the Pacific region. Life expectancy is placed at 50.9\r\nyears, the lowest among developing countries.\r\nAt the same time, a new and more demanding\r\ninternational economic order is emerging, one in which\r\nAfrica is beginning to feel overwhelmed and isolated\r\nfrom the mainstream of world economic development. If\r\nsome of its nations have not yet caught up with the\r\nindustrial revolution, what hope have they, unaided, of\r\nreaching the heights of the technological and information\r\nrevolutions which are sweeping the developed countries\r\nof the world towards new horizons.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nIf we are to bring Africa into the general march of the\r\neconomies of the world towards progress and prosperity, we\r\nmust begin, at the highest level, to coordinate and to chart\r\na course for Africa to join in. Piecemeal aid and occasional\r\nintervention on the occasion of awesome disasters will not\r\nbe enough.\r\nTherefore, we welcome the Group of Seven’s\r\ncommitment in Lyon to a partnership for development and\r\nto the elimination of trade barriers to exports from\r\ndeveloping countries. These barriers must come down. But\r\nwe question whether this and private investment alone will\r\nbe sufficient. Swift and dramatic debt relief for countries in\r\nneed of it is essential. We welcome the lead provided by\r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\r\nin this regard, but it must be followed by decisive and\r\nurgent action. Measures should also be designed to promote\r\nthe growth of real democracy and good governance, for\r\neconomic prosperity must go hand in hand with democracy\r\nand the rule of law. It may seem temporarily otherwise. It\r\nmay seem that the creation of wealth can, for a while, be\r\nseparated from the yearning of the people and of\r\nindividuals to be free, but sooner or later the force of the\r\naspirations which prosperity brings will burst forth, as the\r\nwaters burst from the dam.\r\nSurely we must look with dismay at many areas of our\r\nworld in which human rights are discounted or denied. A\r\ncase in point is Myanmar, where a democratic vote, held in\r\n1990, has been defeated and denied by force, and where the\r\nhouse of the elected leader of the people is kept under\r\nconstant surveillance and surrounded by soldiers.\r\nMy Government will continue to support the cause of\r\ndemocracy and human rights in Africa and wherever in the\r\nworld such support is required. Mauritius will later this\r\nmonth host the twentieth session of the African\r\nCommission of Human and People’s Rights, which\r\ncommemorates the tenth anniversary of its African Charter.\r\nThis session of the Commission will undertake, with the\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations and other\r\ninterested elements of civil society, an assessment and\r\nreevaluation of the implementation of the Charter and\r\nprepare a five-year plan of action which we are confident\r\nwill greatly help strengthen and improve the situation of\r\nhuman rights in our continent.\r\nMy country, whose only resources are the stability of\r\nits democracy and the enterprising spirit of its people,\r\ncomprises many races, cultures and religions. We look to\r\nEurope, Africa, the Far East and the Indian subcontinent for\r\nour cultural inheritance. Our people cross many divides.\r\nTherefore, we are able to witness and sense the impact of\r\nthe rapid development of the modern world upon these\r\ndifferent cultures and peoples more quickly, because we\r\nare a part of them. And I can tell the Assembly that what\r\nwe see gives us cause for concern.\r\nAs the old world order passes and a new one\r\nreplaces it, we are going through a period of transition\r\nfraught with pitfalls and dangers. We cannot but be\r\ndismayed at the number of countries that are falling prey\r\nto the ancient and deadly sirens of ethnicity and narrow\r\nnationalism that appeal to man’s baser instincts of\r\nintolerance and xenophobic fear. Our continent of Africa\r\nseems particularly affected. Somalia and Liberia seem to\r\ndescend endlessly into chaos, while Burundi threatens to\r\nblow up again.\r\nWe are concerned by recent indications that parties\r\nto the Middle East peace process may be giving in to the\r\ntemptation of pandering to extremist fringes. We owe\r\npeace to this Holy Land and to the generations to come.\r\nWe owe it to the memory of two statesmen who laid\r\ndown their lives to this cause. The resolute pursuit of\r\npeace is the only way to defeat the assassins, those who\r\nfelled President Sadat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.\r\nIn the Commonwealth family of nations to which we\r\nbelong, the uniqueness of which is its very diversity, a\r\nnumber of Member States are blighted by this affliction.\r\nMauritius fervently hopes that the sister island of Fiji\r\nwill soon be able to resume its rightful place in the\r\ncomity of nations by correcting the inequities written into\r\nthat nation’s constitution in a moment of tension, when\r\nracist passions were unbridled. We would be pleased to\r\nshare with the people of Fiji our own constitutional\r\nexperience of a pluricultural society.\r\nIn my own country, only 10 months ago in a free\r\nand democratic election, the people voted overwhelmingly\r\nfor change. The Government has pledged to render our\r\ndemocratic process even more transparent and\r\nunequivocal. The numerous strategies and policy\r\nobjectives enunciated by the new Government at the\r\nbeginning of the current legislature, earlier this year, aim\r\nprecisely at confronting squarely the problems that we\r\nface on all the issues that I have broached. Our overriding\r\nobjective will be to ultimately make the economy work\r\nfor the people and not the people work for the economy.\r\nWhile a Government’s overall objective is to\r\nimprove the well-being of the people, sound economic\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\npolicies alone will not make our countries prosper. In order\r\nto create the right environment for the economy to flourish\r\nthere must be good governance. This is also a moral\r\nimperative. The history of mankind inevitably moves in the\r\ndirection of greater freedom, more transparency, wider\r\naccountability in all sectors of public life and greater access\r\nto information held by public agencies relating to citizens.\r\nMy Government is committed to a continuing process\r\nof democratization which will reinforce our institutions by\r\ncreating wider confidence in them. We are convinced that\r\nthis will create a climate more conducive to investment and\r\nwill enhance the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of our\r\npeople.\r\nWhile the pursuit of happiness has perforce to be\r\nindividual and private, it cannot be to the detriment of the\r\ncollective good. The protection of the environment is one\r\nendeavour that has to be undertaken collectively at the\r\nnational as well as the global level. Only if mankind as a\r\nwhole takes care to ensure the integrity of our planet can\r\nwe envisage a future for generations yet to be born. It is up\r\nto us to ensure the viability and ecological health of the\r\nplanet we shall bequeath to those who come after us. My\r\nGovernment will pursue on its own national territory a\r\nvigorous policy of conservation and rehabilitation of natural\r\nresources. Our actions at the national level will be matched\r\nby our contributions at the international and regional levels,\r\nin concert with all our partners, to advance on these same\r\nissues.\r\nThrough our membership in regional and subregional\r\norganizations, we are undertaking, in close partnership with\r\nneighbouring countries, to advance and promote the same\r\nobjectives that I have defined. Only one year after joining\r\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC),\r\nMauritius has become an active member, putting its skills\r\nand knowledge in sectors where it has acquired valuable\r\nexperience at the service of fellow members.\r\nMauritius informed this Assembly last year that it had\r\ninitiated a process for the creation of a regional cooperation\r\nplatform in the Indian Ocean region. Indeed, the Indian\r\nOcean region was the only one in the world which did not\r\nhave such a platform to discuss the economic and social\r\ndevelopment policies of its countries in a coordinated\r\nmanner. I am pleased to inform the Assembly this year that\r\nthe Mauritius Indian Ocean Rim Initiative has gathered\r\nconsiderable momentum. The Initiative, which started with\r\nonly seven countries, has doubled its membership to 14\r\ncountries. A charter has been drawn up to provide the\r\nrelevant framework within which to develop and implement\r\nregional cooperation programmes. In addition, in contrast\r\nwith some existing regional blocs, it has adopted an\r\noutward-looking approach, so as to be compatible with\r\nthe multilateral system. The association has the\r\ndistinguishing feature of having adopted a tripartite\r\napproach comprising government, the private sector and\r\nthe academic community, to ensure as wide a consensus\r\nas possible.\r\nMauritius is convening a ministerial meeting in the\r\nfirst week of March 1997 to give political blessing to the\r\nIndian Ocean rim association for regional cooperation.\r\nThe Indian Ocean region can now serenely look forward\r\nto playing its role, as a serious regional partner in the\r\ninternational arena, in the effort to uplift the standard of\r\nliving of the peoples of the region. I am sure that the\r\ninternational community will lend its full support to this\r\nnascent regional grouping, in line with the often repeated\r\nappeal for South-South cooperation.\r\nWe have witnessed in recent years the growing\r\nsignificance of regional accords and blocs in determining\r\nand fashioning the orientation of multilateral financial and\r\ntrading systems and institutions. We believe that\r\nregionalization is a necessary step towards a more liberal\r\nglobal environment inasmuch as it allows the less\r\nendowed countries and regions with specificities of their\r\nown to experiment and to test the political, economic and\r\nsocial reforms of their programmes. A similar approach\r\nhas been adopted by the more advanced countries and\r\nregions, as evidenced by the emergence of the North\r\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement and the consolidation of\r\nexisting groupings, such as the European Union and the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, to mention just\r\na couple of them.\r\nIn addition, we have witnessed a new interpretation\r\nof the concept of regional blocs as purely geographical\r\nunits that make use of their own individual characteristics\r\nto experiment, and to test political, economic and social\r\nreforms programmes within a smaller geographical entity\r\nbefore challenges are confronted on a worldwide scale.\r\nRegionalization is increasingly being viewed by aid\r\ndonors and international financial institutions as a means\r\nto promote overall economic development and to create\r\nan enabling environment that will attract foreign direct\r\ninvestment in specific regions. This process has also\r\nchanged the way in which international businesses and\r\nmultinational corporations are restructuring their activities.\r\nImprovements in telecommunications facilities, the\r\nadoption of advanced technology for the transmission of\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\ninformation in real time and the use of more rapid and\r\nreliable modes of transportation have all contributed to\r\ngiving regionalization a new dimension in political and\r\neconomic issues. Hence, the prospects for ensuring a more\r\nbalanced global development process are more real and\r\nattainable.\r\nThe decades-old partnership between African,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and the European\r\nUnion through the Lomé Conventions, the fourth of which\r\nwill come to an end in the year 2000, has served as an\r\nexcellent instrument for trading agreements between the\r\nAfrican, Asian, Pacific and Caribbean countries and the\r\nEuropean Union. This instrument has to a very large extent\r\nhelped in consolidating the links between the ACP States\r\nand the European Union. It has permitted the growth of\r\ntrade, economic, political, social and cultural development,\r\nfor both developed and underdeveloped countries. However,\r\nthe successor agreement to Lomé IV will have to take into\r\naccount the changing pattern in world trade and the\r\nacquired benefits under the Lomé Conventions, and in this\r\ncontext we shall wait for the publication of the green book\r\non the subject commissioned by the European Union.\r\nThe Sugar Protocol, which provides for guaranteed\r\nprices and quotas for the ACP sugar-producing countries,\r\nhas been instrumental to a large extent in the socio-\r\neconomic development of Mauritius.\r\nWhile I have addressed development issues mainly, we\r\nshould not overlook the crucial question of disarmament.\r\nThe principled stand of Mauritius in the field of\r\ndisarmament has always been to advocate a world free of\r\nnuclear weapons as well as chemical and other weapons of\r\nmass destruction. On the question of nuclear weapons, we\r\nonce again reaffirm our total commitment to nuclear\r\ndisarmament, and hope that the world community will make\r\nall efforts to secure unanimity around the views expressed\r\nin this Assembly by Member States that have some\r\ndifficulties with some treaty provisions. Furthermore, with\r\nregard particularly to the position of Mauritius on the recent\r\ndecision on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nwe stood by the principle that we have always applied to\r\nother issues in the past, namely that of fairness and non-\r\ndiscrimination against any party. It is therefore imperative\r\nthat we give renewed momentum to the disarmament\r\nprocess in general, and address the flaws of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty urgently.\r\nIn order to meet the challenges of the next century, we\r\nbelieve that it is urgently necessary to pursue the reform of\r\nthe United Nations. It is vital that the Security Council\r\nshould be enlarged and made more representative and\r\nbalanced among its permanent members, and should\r\ninclude developing countries such as India. And it is\r\nequally imperative that the Working Groups of the\r\nGeneral Assembly should complete their task of\r\nproducing an effective and credible programme for\r\nreform. It seems to us self-evident that, after 50 years,\r\nsome revision and redesign is necessary. We think, with\r\nShakespeare,\r\n“When we mean to build,\r\nWe first survey the plot, then draw the model;\r\nAnd when we see the figure of the house,\r\nThen we must rate the cost of the erection;\r\nWhich if we find outweighs ability,\r\nWhat do we then but draw anew the model\r\nIn fewer offices...?” (King Henry IV, Part 2, Act I,\r\nScene 3)\r\nSome have come to this Assembly in order to\r\ncomplain that the world and the United Nations are not\r\ndoing enough. But we should inquire of ourselves first:\r\nWhat are we doing to advance or to hinder these causes\r\nupon which, in principle, there is such remarkable\r\nagreement?\r\nAfter this overview of the world situation, allow me\r\nto speak of a matter of national interest to us. One of the\r\nfundamental principles to which we all subscribe is that\r\nof respect for the sovereignty of Member States.\r\nInterference in the internal affairs of States and disregard\r\nfor their national sovereignty has often been a source of\r\ntension and conflict. Now that the cold war is behind us\r\nand we move towards ever greater economic, commercial\r\nand cultural integration, we should be able to find\r\namicable answers to questions of sovereignty. Mauritius\r\nhas sovereignty disputes regarding the Chagos\r\nArchipelago and Tromelin Island with two countries with\r\nwhich we have historically close and friendly ties. These\r\ndifferences were referred to as friendly disputes by\r\nSir Seewoosagar Ramgoolam, architect of our\r\nindependence and father our nation. We hope to resolve\r\nthese differences through quiet diplomacy and dialogue.\r\nThe cold war has died, but the need for peace and\r\nsecurity lives on. The state of affairs in the world today\r\nchallenges us but must not daunt us. Against this\r\nbackground, the principle of meliorism — that the world\r\nmay be made better by human effort — should prevail in\r\nour actions. Those who have the means and capabilities\r\nto help should not waver or shy away at the call of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nThese are some of the ideas that I wanted to share\r\ntoday. It is my hope that we will all join in a global\r\npartnership for the achievement of a better and stronger\r\nUnited Nations at the service of the peoples in whose name\r\nwe stand here.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I call next on His Excellency\r\nMr. Ugyen Tshering, Chairman of the Delegation of\r\nBhutan.\r\nMr. Tshering (Bhutan): I have the honour to convey\r\nto the President and all the members the warm greetings\r\nand good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck,\r\nKing of Bhutan, for the success of the fifty-first session of\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly.\r\nWe congratulate Ambassador Razali on his unanimous\r\nelection as President of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are happy that a close friend of Bhutan is\r\npresiding over our deliberations. We are fully aware of his\r\nwide experience and deep interest in the United Nations. He\r\nis not only an outspoken critic of the shortcomings of the\r\nUnited Nations but is also one of its greatest supporters,\r\nand we look to this session with high expectations.\r\nI would like to express our deepest appreciation to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the exemplary\r\nmanner in which he conducted the Special Commemorative\r\nMeeting of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nand the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. I am also\r\ngrateful for the privilege of having had the opportunity to\r\nserve in his Bureau.\r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to pay a\r\nspecial tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his leadership in steering the United\r\nNations through a period of many challenges and changes.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, on 21 September 1971, Bhutan\r\nbecame a Member of the United Nations. That day saw the\r\nfulfilment of a long-cherished dream and was a historic\r\noccasion on which the people of Bhutan joined hands with\r\nthe international community. We have since taken great\r\npride in our membership of the world body and have made\r\ngreat strides. Bhutan has stepped forward to take an\r\nactive role by seeking membership in all major United\r\nNations and other international bodies including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions. Our membership of the\r\nUnited Nations has provided us with the opportunity to\r\nparticipate in all international discussions of importance.\r\nOur participation, which we consider both a privilege and\r\nan obligation, has always been guided by a positive\r\nattitude, seeking to contribute constructively and fairly.\r\nOn the part of the international community, Bhutan\r\nhas received an outpouring of goodwill and friendship.\r\nThe United Nations and its agencies have come to our\r\nassistance with enthusiasm and dedication. Every sector\r\nin Bhutan has received the benefit of United Nations\r\nassistance, and the lives of the people of Bhutan have\r\ngreatly improved. Today, the development of Bhutan rests\r\nin the hands of young Bhutanese, many of whom were\r\ntrained through United Nations assistance. I take this\r\nopportunity to put on record the heartfelt gratitude of the\r\npeople of Bhutan to the United Nations and international\r\ninstitutions, in particular the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, the United Nations\r\nCapital Development Fund, the International Fund for\r\nAgricultural Development, the World Food Programme,\r\nthe United Nations Volunteers programme, the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World\r\nHealth Organization, the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the World Bank and\r\nthe African Development Bank, many of which have been\r\nworking constructively in Bhutan for the last 25 years.\r\nBhutan takes the opportunity of the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of our membership to rededicate ourselves to\r\nthe principles of the United Nations and its Charter. As\r\nwe rededicate ourselves to the United Nations and express\r\nour support and gratitude, we are conscious of the fact\r\nthat the United Nations is at a crossroads, and that there\r\nis a struggle for the heart and soul of the Organization.\r\nThe world has changed, and the United Nations too must\r\nchange to meet the new realities.\r\nToday we would like to confine our remarks to a\r\nfew areas which we feel need to be addressed in the\r\nprocess of reform and in preparing the United Nations for\r\nthe next century.\r\nThe increase in membership from the original 51\r\nMembers to the current 185 is the clearest indication that\r\nthe United Nations is truly a global body. The\r\nrepresentation and participation of all United Nations\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nMembers in the General Assembly give true meaning and\r\nlegitimacy to the United Nations, yet increasingly the\r\nGeneral Assembly has little influence in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. The role of the Assembly must be\r\nenhanced. It must become the centre of the United Nations\r\nand the source of both its moral and real authority. In order\r\nto do this, the General Assembly must change its own\r\nworking methods, and its debates and agenda must be made\r\nmore meaningful. It must become the point from which all\r\nUnited Nations policies emanate. The General Assembly’s\r\nrelations with other principal organs and bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations must be streamlined and strengthened.\r\nThe structure of other principal organs such as the\r\nEconomic and Social Council must also be reviewed. In\r\nmany of the principal organs, subsidiary bodies and\r\ncommissions have taken a more prominent role than the\r\norgans themselves. While we agree that the more detailed\r\nwork of implementing the technical aspects must be\r\ndevolved to commissions and subsidiary bodies, policies\r\nmust be made by the principal organs themselves. Many\r\nhere will agree that the subsidiary bodies, committees,\r\ngroups, and so forth, are too numerous to keep track of, let\r\nalone participate in. All United Nations bodies must finally\r\nbe made accountable to the General Assembly. Unless this\r\nlinkage is strengthened, many Members will be excluded\r\nfrom the activities of the United Nations. For many smaller\r\nMembers, the possibility of being elected to and\r\nparticipating in many United Nations bodies is limited.\r\nTherefore, the General Assembly is of paramount\r\nimportance for enhancing the participation and role of\r\nMember countries.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, there is increasing\r\nconcern that the United Nations is unable to maintain peace\r\nand provide security, particularly for its smaller and more\r\nvulnerable Members. This view seems to persist despite a\r\nnumber of successful interventions by the United Nations.\r\nThere is growing frustration that the Security Council, the\r\nonly body of the United Nations with any real authority, is\r\nunable to respond to the challenges posed by the present\r\nconflicts, and that the Security Council is primarily driven\r\nby the views of its major members. The need for reform\r\nand expansion is more and more keenly felt. In our view,\r\nthere must be an increase in the number of both permanent\r\nand non-permanent members. Developing countries and\r\ndeserving countries from all regions must be included in the\r\nranks of permanent members. Using the objective criteria\r\nof equitable distribution, the ability to contribute to the\r\nwork of the United Nations and the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, Bhutan believes that India\r\nand Japan qualify for permanent membership of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nExpansion alone is not sufficient. The decision-\r\nmaking process of the Security Council, its relations with\r\nthe General Assembly, and other powers such as the veto\r\nand the Council’s virtual hold over the appointment of\r\njudges of the International Court of Justice and other\r\nimportant positions in the United Nations, must be\r\nreviewed.\r\nProgress towards a world free of tension can only be\r\nmade with disarmament that includes all types of\r\nweapons. While various steps have been taken towards\r\neasing the nuclear threat, no significant progress towards\r\nthe goal of the complete elimination of all nuclear\r\nweapons has been made. We must not lose sight of the\r\nprimary objective of the complete elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons. The disarmament dialogue must include all\r\nparties and address the genuine concerns of every\r\nMember State.\r\nA brisk international business in conventional arms\r\ncontinues to pose a threat to peace and security. As long\r\nas there is an unlimited supply of arms, their use in the\r\nsettlement of disputes will continue. We must expand our\r\ninitiatives at the United Nations to control the global arms\r\ntrade. Bhutan supports the steps taken towards the\r\nelimination of chemical and biological weapons. The\r\nUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms is a useful\r\nstep. Efforts must also be redoubled to bring about a\r\nmoratorium on the manufacture, sale and deployment of\r\nanti-personnel landmines, with the objective of\r\neliminating this weapon which kills indiscriminately.\r\nWith the major agreements and common ground\r\narrived at during the United Nations global conferences of\r\nthe 1990s, it was hoped that the stage had been set for\r\nfresh impetus and a new direction in international\r\ndevelopment. In reality the new era of development has\r\ncontinued to elude us.\r\nThere is an emerging consensus that the new\r\napproach to development must be to concentrate on the\r\nwell-being of the individual person and to release the\r\nproductive capacity of the human spirit and of nations\r\nthrough social development, free markets, international\r\ntrade and investment. While this strategy has brought\r\nprogress to many countries, many poorer developing\r\ncountries have not been able to compete and benefit, due\r\nto structural inadequacies in their economies or because\r\nof the small size of their markets.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nTo adapt to the new approaches to development, all\r\nUnited Nations agencies have to undergo major changes in\r\ntheir organization and operations. However, the resources\r\navailable to United Nations agencies have declined both in\r\nactual and real terms. Many of them are unable to carry out\r\nprogrammes at the level of previous cycles. In these\r\ncircumstances, many of the targets set in the major global\r\nconferences, whether in health, environment, population,\r\neducation, or other social fields, may not be met.\r\nIt is often said that the overall contribution of United\r\nNations agencies to a country’s development is small.\r\nWhile this may be the case in larger countries, it should be\r\npointed out that in many smaller countries the input of\r\nUnited Nations agencies plays a substantial role. It is\r\nunfortunate that the most far-reaching responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations, which can make a lasting impact in\r\nimproving the lives of millions of people, is being\r\nconstrained and reduced at a time when more efforts are\r\nnecessary.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations development bodies\r\nare of particular importance to the 48 least developed\r\ncountries. It has become increasingly difficult for the\r\nconcerns and needs of these countries to find a place in the\r\ninternational development dialogue. The United Nations,\r\nthrough the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment and all other agencies, must ensure that the\r\nsituation and the needs of the least developed countries are\r\nkept in focus and as part of any agenda for development.\r\nOtherwise we risk the further marginalization of a\r\nsignificant number of countries.\r\nThe United Nations development agencies must ensure\r\nthat the resources they spend in finding and developing new\r\nideas and approaches are balanced and matched by\r\nprogrammes and resources in the field. The agencies and\r\ndeveloping countries must work closely together in order to\r\nregain the confidence of the donor community. Bhutan\r\nstrongly believes that the special role that many\r\ndevelopment agencies fulfil must not be allowed to\r\ndiminish due to a lack of funds.\r\nBhutan recognizes that developing countries must\r\nwork closely with other major participants in the\r\ninternational development effort, such as financial\r\ninstitutions, bilateral donors and the world business\r\ncommunity. Bhutan has greatly benefitted from the\r\ncontributions and efforts of our bilateral donors. Their\r\nassistance has been utilized effectively and has contributed\r\nmeaningfully to our development. We take this opportunity\r\nto express our gratitude to our bilateral donors, in particular\r\nIndia, Switzerland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands,\r\nAustria, Norway, Kuwait, Germany, Australia and\r\nThailand, for their cooperation and generous assistance.\r\nAllow me to express a few thoughts concerning the\r\nimpact of reform on the United Nations. We are aware\r\nthat the issue of reforming the United Nations system and\r\nits organizational structure is not new, and that it was\r\nraised just a few years after the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations itself. However, the issue of\r\norganizational reform has taken on special significance in\r\nthe last few years, given the financial situation of the\r\nUnited Nations and some of its major agencies. While the\r\ndialogue on reform of the United Nations continues, the\r\nOrganization has had to implement major cuts in staff and\r\nactivities. The morale of the international civil servants\r\nhas been greatly affected. This situation should not be\r\nallowed to continue for long. All Member countries must\r\ntake cognizance of these facts, work towards completing\r\nthe reform process, and place the Organization on a firm\r\nfinancial footing at an early date.\r\nWe must not be afraid of reform and change. Major\r\nchanges have already been carried out, and there are still\r\nmany areas which need to be addressed. However, it is\r\nour view that the process of reform of the Organization\r\nshould be time-bound. A long, drawn out process with no\r\nend in sight will hinder the Organization in effectively\r\ncarrying out the vast responsibilities we have assigned to\r\nit.\r\nThe calls for change and reform of the United\r\nNations, in their own way, are the best indicator of the\r\nstrong support of its Members. The United Nations today\r\nhas become an indispensable institution in international\r\nrelations and development. It is up to us, the Member\r\nStates, to ensure that it will be able to meet the\r\naspirations and expectations of all its Members, large and\r\nsmall. It must become the source of inspiration for all and\r\na guiding beacon that will take the world to the next\r\nmillennium of peace and prosperity for all the peoples\r\nand nations of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I call next on the Chairman\r\nof the delegation of Dominica, His Excellency Mr. Simon\r\nPaul Richards.\r\nMr. Richards (Dominica): It is indeed a pleasure\r\nfor me to extend my delegation’s congratulations to\r\nAmbassador Razali and his country, Malaysia, on his\r\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I entertain no doubt that\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nhe will be able to draw upon his proven diplomatic skills\r\nand considerable experience to guide the affairs of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in a creditable and exemplary manner.\r\nPermit me also to express my appreciation and thanks to\r\nhis immediate predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\r\nPortugal, for the competence which he demonstrated in\r\npresiding over the historic fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe United Nations was established 51 years ago with\r\na focus on the maintenance of peace and security, and\r\nwhile that remains the objective, the linkage between peace\r\nand economic and social development, enshrined in the\r\nCharter, must be recognized and strengthened if the world\r\nis to escape the inexorable consequences of the\r\ncontinuously widening gap between rich and poor nations.\r\nWe were led to believe that the peace dividend resulting\r\nfrom the end of the cold war would provide the engine for\r\ngreater economic development. Obviously, that has not\r\nmaterialized. Indeed, the opposite has occurred. The\r\ndeveloping world continues to experience a steady\r\nshrinkage of development assistance. And at this critical\r\njuncture, small island States, already hampered by size,\r\ngeographic location, topography and climatic conditions, are\r\nhaving their very existence threatened by the policies and\r\npractices of multinationals, made all the more formidable\r\nby overwhelming support from their Governments.\r\nThe production and export of bananas are vital to the\r\neconomic viability of the Commonwealth of Dominica, as\r\nthey are to all the islands of the Windward group. The\r\nbanana industry in the Windward Islands accounts for less\r\nthan 5 per cent of world production. The producers are\r\nsmall landowners; the production costs are relatively high;\r\nand any attempt by the Windward Islands producers to sell\r\ntheir products on the open market would be suicidal.\r\nRecognizing the peculiar difficulties of Windward Islands\r\nproducers and their traditional access to the European\r\nmarket, the European Union has established a regime\r\nreserving less than 10 per cent of its market for bananas\r\nfrom the Caribbean. That regime is now under attack from\r\nmultinationals in Latin America and elsewhere, with huge\r\nresources augmented by the power, prestige and political\r\nmight of their national Governments.\r\nIn the struggle to save an industry critical to our\r\neconomic survival, our political stability and our democratic\r\ntraditions and institutions, we call upon the international\r\ncommunity to take note of the very real possibility of social\r\nupheaval and political disaster in the region if this challenge\r\nto the European Union regime were to succeed. It is rather\r\nincongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of\r\nthe effort to establish democratic institutions and\r\nrepresentative governments in certain parts of the world\r\nare also engaged in an enterprise which, if successful, is\r\ncalculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life\r\nin the eastern Caribbean. The international community has\r\nan interest in seeing that these small societies remain free\r\nand stable, and it has an obligation to ensure that that\r\nfreedom and stability subsist.\r\nThe scourge of illicit drug traffic and drug abuse\r\nmust continue to be of great concern to the international\r\ncommunity. The problem knows no boundary, it respects\r\nno ideology or power, it makes no distinction between\r\nrich and poor, North and South, East and West. Its engine\r\nis driven by the prospect of huge fortunes amassed\r\nclandestinely and quickly. Universal in its destructive\r\nforce, the illicit drug problem presents a unique challenge\r\nto the world. The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken\r\nsteps, commensurate with its limited resources, to deal\r\nwith the problem at the national level, and it is a party to\r\ncooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the\r\ntrans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean\r\nregion. Recognizing, however, that the problem is\r\ndemand-driven, we must make it clear that the prospects\r\nfor success in this effort will remain dim unless there is\r\na greater undertaking by the major consumer centres to\r\nreduce the demand for the product.\r\nConnected with international drug trafficking is the\r\nillegal trade in arms and, tangentially, international\r\nterrorism. The twin evils of illicit arms and international\r\nterrorism have as their purpose the destruction of innocent\r\nlives, the violation of the fundamental tenets of the\r\ncivilized world and the subversion of the democratic\r\nfreedoms of all mankind. An unprecedented effort by\r\nMembers of the United Nations will be required if we are\r\nto control the illicit trade in arms and extinguish the\r\nthreat of terrorism. Compounding the problem is the legal\r\ntrade in conventional weapons of increasing sophistication\r\nand destructiveness. With regard to nuclear weapons, the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica believes that the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty are merely way-stations on the road to the\r\ndesirable end of a world free of all such arsenals.\r\nWe are extremely concerned and aggrieved by the\r\ncontinuing practice of trans-shipping nuclear waste and\r\nother hazardous substances through the Caribbean Sea.\r\nAssurances of safe procedures and infinitesimal risks are\r\nunconvincing, particularly when such trans-shipments are\r\nmade through the Caribbean Sea during the hurricane\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nseason and at a period of heightened seismic activity in the\r\nCaribbean region.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica, together with other\r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\ncontinues to view this dangerous practice as a potentially\r\nserious threat to the fragile ecosystem and to the livelihood\r\nand well-being of the people of the region, and we call\r\nupon the States engaging in the practice to demonstrate\r\nsome regard for our justifiable concerns. We earnestly seek\r\nthe support of the international community in our ongoing\r\neffort to halt the shipment of these dangerous materials\r\nthrough the Caribbean Sea.\r\nFor several decades, the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nhas exercised and continues to exercise sovereign authority\r\nover a defined geographical area inhabited today by 21\r\nmillion souls. This year, the process of political reform\r\nachieved its ultimate goal when, for the first time in\r\nhistory, the President of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nwas democratically elected in free and fair elections.\r\nDemocracy is alive and well in the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan. The peace and security of the region are not\r\nthreatened today, nor have they ever been threatened, by the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Indeed, the Republic of\r\nChina’s human rights record, its commitment to market\r\neconomy and multilateralism and its economic assistance\r\nprogrammes have served to enhance the prospects for\r\npeace, security and stability in the area and beyond.\r\nAs the members of the European Parliament stated in\r\ntheir resolution of 17 July 1996, the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan can play an important beneficial role in the\r\ninternational community, and it is clear that the exclusion\r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan from the world’s\r\ncouncils, from the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, and from the major international financial\r\ninstitutions concerned with development and the eradication\r\nof poverty is a detriment to us all. The Commonwealth of\r\nDominica believes that on the principle of universality, the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan should be admitted as a\r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nJust over two years ago the world applauded the\r\nprogress that had been made in the bilateral negotiations\r\nbetween Israel and its Arab neighbours in the Middle East,\r\nand we expressed cautious optimism with respect to the\r\neventual resolution of the conflict and the progress towards\r\na full and just peace in the region. Recent events have\r\ngiven reason for pause, however. We recognize that a\r\nsolution to the problem in the Middle East can only be\r\nachieved through the energies of the States in the region\r\nand their genuine commitment to peace. But the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations in\r\nparticular have an interest — indeed, a duty — to\r\nfacilitate and assist the process towards the realization of\r\nthe legitimate hopes, aspirations and security needs of the\r\npeoples in the area.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica abhors the concept\r\nof national laws having extraterritorial jurisdiction and\r\nserving as underpinnings for illegal secondary boycotts.\r\nWe are particularly troubled by the potential use of these\r\ninstruments by large and powerful States to compromise\r\nthe territorial integrity and national sovereignty of small\r\nStates like ours.\r\nThe restructuring and reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem continues in the face of a forced financial crisis\r\nthat undermines the very result intended by the reform\r\nprogramme, namely, an Organization with the capacity to\r\ndischarge its worldwide obligations effectively and\r\nefficiently. We continue to be supportive of the efforts to\r\nexercise budgetary restraints, to reduce waste and to\r\neliminate unnecessary duplication, but we caution against\r\na programme of retrenchment detrimental to the existence\r\nof programmes designed to assist small developing\r\nnations. Indeed, we believe that the end-product of the\r\nreform of the United Nations should be an Organization\r\nbetter equipped to be an effective force for development\r\nand economic growth.\r\nIn this age of globalization, the United Nations\r\ncontinues to be an important agent for economic growth\r\nand development and a vital instrument in maintaining\r\nworld peace. The Commonwealth of Dominica recognizes\r\nand applauds the achievements of the United Nations in\r\nthose areas. The capacity of the Organization to meet the\r\nchallenges of the years ahead will depend on our\r\ncollective will and commitment to effecting measurable\r\nimprovement in the human condition.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Central African\r\nRepublic, Mr. Henry Koba.\r\nMr. Koba (Central African Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): On behalf of the delegation of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, I should like to express our warmest\r\nand most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Razali Ismail on\r\nhis election to the presidency of this session. His proven\r\nskill in international affairs assures us that our work will\r\nbe crowned with success. I would assure him of my\r\ndelegation’s cooperation.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nWe also wish to extend to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, the deepest appreciation of\r\nthe delegation of the Central African Republic for the\r\ncompetence with which he served the Organization\r\nthroughout his mandate.\r\nLastly, I should like to pay a heartfelt tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his courageous and tireless work, work\r\nwhich does honour to Africa and which is often performed\r\nin a hostile context, to have the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter prevail in all circumstances. The work of\r\nour Secretary-General deserves to be encouraged and must\r\ncontinue.\r\nThe evaluation of the United Nations 50 years of\r\nexistence revealed the Organization’s continuing\r\nshortcomings in the accomplishment of its mission.\r\nHowever, the end of the cold war, which allowed us to\r\nglimpse a new era in international relations, opened\r\nprospects for renewed cooperation commensurate with the\r\nhopes that emerged at the end of the world’s division into\r\nblocs. In that connection, the United Nations was at last to\r\nrediscover its capacity to handle relations among States on\r\nthe sole basis of the application of the principles that have\r\nbrought us together here in this Hall.\r\nOpposing tendencies continue to vie for attention at a\r\ntime when we must, with shared resolution, ensure respect\r\nfor an international rule of law. The world today has\r\nchanged. The aspiration to wider freedom and greater\r\nrecognition of equality is stronger than ever before.\r\nThus, the delegation of the Central African Republic\r\nbelieves that the shortcomings and limitations of our\r\nOrganization, like those inherent in any human endeavour,\r\nmust be rectified, and they can be, if States give priority to\r\nconcerted action, to dialogue and a shared search for\r\nsolutions to the world’s problems. Together, we will be\r\nbetter able to establish the universal values of the United\r\nNations. Indeed, that is our principal task.\r\nThe wider advent of democracy, its affirmation and its\r\nimplantation are of course primarily the choice of a people.\r\nHowever, democracy, which is a universal value, is also the\r\nstruggle of all democratically minded people who share its\r\nideals, and the struggle of the United Nations, whose very\r\nestablishment was a response to an international order of\r\ndictatorship and terror with the tragic consequences we all\r\nknown. We are therefore in duty bound to create true\r\nsolidarity so as to ensure the defence and spread of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThis is an appropriate time for me to dwell for a\r\nmoment on the case of my own country, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic.\r\nIn the space of one month, a country that was\r\nalready very far advanced in negotiations to conclude an\r\nagreement with the Bretton Woods institutions was to\r\nundergo two mutinies that proved to be attempts at coups\r\nd’états. The world was presented with a shocking and\r\nunfamiliar picture of my country, erasing the efforts of\r\nthe national community to turn its back on its past and\r\nwiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devote\r\nthemselves, within the framework of their sovereign\r\nchoice, to the search for the means of developing the\r\nCentral African Republic, with its vast potential in\r\nmining, agriculture and livestock and with its abundant\r\nrainfall.\r\nThere were deaths, there was destruction, but above\r\nall there was an attempt, by force of arms, to impose the\r\nwill of a tiny fraction of the nation on the majority. The\r\nlong struggle of the Central African nation freely to\r\nchoose its leaders at the ballot box was about to be\r\nobliterated without any legitimacy or legality whatsoever.\r\nCentral African democracy is three years old. It is\r\ndeveloping in very difficult economic circumstances, and\r\nit must find within itself the necessary spirit of\r\nconfidence, solidarity, hard work and organization. The\r\naffairs of state of this young democracy must be given the\r\ntransparency needed for good governance and the\r\nconfidence to build at last a country whose potential will\r\nenable it to provide its children with a healthy future.\r\nThat is the constant message that President Ange-\r\nFélix Patassé, our Head of State, has expressed to his\r\ncompatriots ever since assuming office in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic. But there is still a long road to follow,\r\nand one strewn with pitfalls, before we can arrive at the\r\ntranquillity of older democracies that makes military\r\nadventurism inadmissible.\r\nWhile this destiny is mainly the responsibility of\r\neach country, the Central African Republic believes that\r\ndefence of the universal values of freedom and equality\r\nis also the responsibility of all democrats, whether or not\r\nthey are States. That is why I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express the gratitude of the Government of\r\nthe Central African Republic to those friendly countries,\r\nespecially France, the United States of America,\r\nGermany, Gabon, Chad, Zaire, Congo, Senegal, Togo,\r\nBenin, Mali, Côte d’Ivoire and Sudan, which gave their\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nsupport, in the name of the principles of democracy, to the\r\nchoices of the Central African Republic and its institutions\r\nduring this difficult period. That same appreciation is\r\nextended to the Secretary-General of the OAU, and above\r\nall to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his\r\nunambiguous and courageous position in defence of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nCollectively, the Central Africans overcame this\r\ndifficult stage in the history of their country because in\r\ndark moments they always had the spirit to find a solution\r\nto preserve the essential, the unity of the country,\r\nreinforced by a common language, Sango.\r\nSince then, the Central African Republic has been\r\nworking to find ways and means to strengthen the peace\r\nand security it has restored. Hence, with the participation of\r\nfriendly countries such as France, Gabon, Senegal, and Mali\r\n(with the contribution of its former President Amadou\r\nToumani Toure), the Government has organized national\r\nstructures for defence. It recently convened an important\r\nseminar, with the support of the United States of America\r\non the role of the military in a democracy. This meeting\r\nserved to draw attention to the place of the army within the\r\nnation; in other words, in a republic the armed forces must\r\nbe under civil authority.\r\nAnother dimension of restoring peace and security is\r\nthe relaunching of the economy. My country wishes to pay\r\ntribute to the promptness with which countries such as\r\nFrance, the Republic of China and Germany and bodies\r\nsuch as the United Nations, through the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) intervened, either\r\nproviding direct support for the re launch or helping to\r\ndevelop an emergency programme leading to a joint\r\nmeeting of donors in Bangui. The pledges made during that\r\nmeeting were encouraging and we hope for further such\r\noffers of support during the round table planned for 1997.\r\nBut it is the intention of the President of the Republic,\r\nAnge-Félix Patassé, to reach an agreement with the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. This\r\nintention has been repeated and will be pursued.\r\nThe course taken in international relations since the\r\nend of the cold war should prompt States to turn to\r\nmultilateral cooperation and United Nations principles\r\nshould come fully into play in crisis settlement. This should\r\napply to the question of the Middle East, where the current\r\npeace process must be pursued and concluded without\r\ndelay. It should also apply to the situation in Rwanda and\r\nBurundi, where regional initiatives must also back up\r\ninternational efforts, in the Western Sahara, in Angola and\r\nin Liberia, where it should be possible to implement the\r\nUnited Nations plan of action.\r\nThe firm political will of all continues to be\r\nnecessary to achieve this, with a constant search for\r\nmechanisms that build and strengthen confidence among\r\nStates. In this respect, the signing of the non-aggression\r\npact among States members of the United Nations\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Questions of Security\r\nin Central Africa will certainly contribute, if observed, to\r\npreserving good-neighbourly relations among the\r\nsignatories and will free the dynamic elements in one of\r\nthe richest regions of the world for integrated\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nIn that same spirit, during this session the Central\r\nAfrican Republic intends to sign the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which it fully supported at the\r\ndraft stage.\r\nPolitical will presupposes the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations authority and its universal nature. That\r\nauthority flows from its rightful place in the world, a\r\nworld that has changed to such an extent since the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations that the working\r\nmethods of its organs need to be adapted. The United\r\nNations is no longer accorded the status it had during the\r\ndecolonization movement. There has been a loss of regard\r\nfor the United Nations, especially since the division of the\r\nworld into hostile blocs came to an end. States,\r\nparticularly the powerful ones, prefer to resolve problems\r\noutside the United Nations, or consider that the\r\nOrganization should merely endorse their decisions. The\r\nUnited Nations should not be used as a tool in this way;\r\ntherein lies the root cause of the powerlessness of which\r\nit stands accused.\r\nThe restructuring efforts begun two years ago must\r\nbe pursued and stressed in order to achieve rational and\r\nreal structural reforms allowing the Organization to\r\noperate more efficiently in various areas, beginning with\r\nthe Security Council. The Security Council should include\r\ncountries from both the North and South that can provide\r\nthe financial and political resources needed by the\r\nOrganization to defend peace. From this standpoint, the\r\nCentral African Republic delegation supports the\r\ninitiatives taken by Germany and Japan. The economic\r\nweight of these countries and their activities to promote\r\ndevelopment and peace give them an outstanding place in\r\ninternational cooperation today.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\nWhat is more, the democratization of international\r\nrelations also involves a strengthening of the universalist\r\nnature of our Organization, because the United Nations,\r\nwith its mission to bring together all States and civilizations\r\nof the world, can no longer refuse to admit States,\r\nespecially if those States are able to meet the obligations\r\ninherent in the status of Member.\r\nI should like to raise here the question of the Republic\r\nof China in Taiwan. My delegation regrets that this\r\nquestion is once again not on our agenda this year. Yet the\r\nfirst consequence of the end of the cold war was the\r\nreassessment of questions associated with this period, for\r\nexample the issues related to General Assembly resolution\r\n2758 (XXVI), which artificially deprives the Republic of\r\nChina of its place in the United Nations. This is a flagrant\r\ninjustice that should be redressed by the international\r\ncommunity, which can surely not allow a sovereign and\r\nindependent State, in which free and democratic elections\r\nhave recently been held, to be indefinitely excluded, with\r\nits 21 million inhabitants, from United Nations activities.\r\nThe European Parliament has recognized this. Last July it\r\nadopted a proposed joint resolution requesting the United\r\nNations to study the possibility of participation by the\r\nRepublic of China in the activities of bodies that report to\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nFurthermore, there are many challenges facing the\r\nworld today requiring the general mobilization of all States,\r\nincluding the Republic of China, whose participation in\r\nefforts for peace and development throughout the world is\r\nalready highly appreciated. The delegation of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic therefore appeals to the General\r\nAssembly’s wisdom and realism and invites it to examine\r\nthe question during its next session so that the Republic of\r\nChina in Taiwan can resume its seat in the United Nations.\r\nIt has been said time and again that the world has\r\nbecome a global village, characterized by an intermingling\r\nof cultures, ideas, economies, markets, norms of behaviour\r\nand the ever more rapid coming together of peoples, despite\r\nthe barriers imposed by frontiers. My delegation believes\r\nthat the acceleration of the process of globalization will\r\nlead to an increasingly integrated approach to development\r\nmanagement so as to find a global solution.\r\nGiven the proliferation of internal conflicts and\r\nregional tensions, the harmful effects of economic disorder,\r\nthe spread of the AIDS pandemic, the rise of crime and\r\nterrorism, violations of human rights, the ever-widening\r\ninternational character of drug-trafficking networks and the\r\ndeterioration of the environment, there is no single area of\r\ninternational relations that does not require a collective\r\neffort on the part of States if it is to be mastered.\r\nThe Central African Republic would like to\r\nemphasize the issue of the AIDS pandemic. This problem\r\nrequires the keen attention of the entire international\r\ncommunity, because no solution is near. The small size\r\nand youthfulness of the country’s population explain why\r\nthe Government is paying special attention to this\r\npandemic, and to the question of health in general. That\r\nis why we believe that agencies such as the World Health\r\nOrganization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund must be encouraged.\r\nFor the delegation of the Central African Republic\r\nthe hope that has been placed in the will of States to\r\nmobilize for this vast international cooperative action will\r\ntruly make it possible to embark on the second 50 years\r\nof the United Nations in a way that will avoid the pitfalls\r\nexperienced during the first 50 years of its existence.\r\nIn our lives as human beings there are always times\r\nwhen we need to look within ourselves, and at our\r\nexistence, to see exactly what must be done and in what\r\ndirection to go. It is the responsibility of States to make\r\nof the United Nations what they want it to be, taking\r\naccount of its failings, weaknesses, limits and\r\nshortcomings.\r\nStates today must do all they can, with a constant\r\neffort of political will, to support our Organization so that\r\nmultilateral cooperation has full scope. The defence of\r\npeace and the promotion of sustainable development\r\nduring this time of globalization cannot succeed\r\notherwise.\r\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic\r\nwould like to share with the other members of the\r\ninternational community the hope that, during the next 50\r\nyears, the world will embark resolutely on the path laid\r\ndown by the founding fathers of the Organization. An\r\nimportant part of the attainment of the principles and\r\nvalues of the Charter will be the implementation of the\r\nproposals made by our\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 10 October 1996\r\ndynamic Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, through the\r\nAgenda for Peace, the Agenda for Development and, above\r\nall, the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
