(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/1)\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is a source of pride and a privilege for us to\r\nsee you, Sir, presiding over the General Assembly with\r\nsuch efficiency, dynamism and sensitivity; your presence\r\ngives us both pleasure and hope.\r\nIn this setting, on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, we observed and took\r\npart in a series of momentous statements on the universal\r\nnature of this Organization, as well as the formulation of\r\nsolemn commitments to the principles and purposes that\r\nhave guided and should continue to guide the future work\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nHowever, predictably, during the past year the\r\npurposes and principles that have guided us for over\r\n50 years have once again undergone unilateral\r\ninterpretation. It seems that those commitments have\r\nbecome nothing more than a dead letter.\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General was especially\r\nobjective in noting that there have been\r\n“indications of a diminished willingness to engage\r\nthe critical issues on the international agenda\r\nthrough the United Nations.” (A/51/1, para. 3)\r\nThis is a core issue in today’s world, and we should\r\nconduct an in-depth analysis of the causes of the problem\r\nand ways to remedy it.\r\nFor the vast majority of our nations, if not for all of\r\nus, the world is now even more insecure than in the past.\r\nPoverty is growing and wealth is becoming increasingly\r\nconcentrated. The gulf between the North and the South\r\nis widening. Conflicts break out, and the United Nations\r\nis unable to find a way to resolve them. The ecological\r\nthreat is becoming more serious and widespread every\r\nday.\r\nMeanwhile, to the astonishment of the vast majority\r\nof humankind, simplistic and, in essence, colonial\r\nconcepts, are being devised to make us believe that our\r\npoverty is our own fault and that so-called globalization\r\nconsists of the globalization of wealth — wealth that is\r\nwithin our grasp if we are industrious and docile tools\r\nwho submit to fashionable dictates.\r\nHowever, the facts show that we can truly speak of\r\nglobalization only in terms of problems and inequality.\r\nOnly an arrogant villager can believe that the world ends\r\nat the edge of his own village, and we are aware of the\r\nchallenges of the modern age — the technology,\r\ninterdependence and intercommunication that make\r\ntoday’s world different. The “globalized world” that some\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nare trying to sell to us, however, is a unipolar world, one\r\nthat is ungovernable because of the growing scale of its\r\nproblems. Any illusion of world government is doomed to\r\nfailure.\r\nNever before has the United Nations faced such\r\nchallenges, and never before have its principles and\r\npurposes been so threatened. Never has the United Nations\r\nfaced such an acute dilemma between serving all or serving\r\nonly a few. If the United Nations were deprived of the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States it would have\r\nno choice but to move inexorably towards becoming a\r\ncaricature of world government; in other words, it would\r\ninevitably become a direct instrument of the super-Power of\r\nthe end of this century.\r\nThese attempts at aggressive unilateral action, which\r\nare humiliating to the sovereignty of all, are already being\r\nfelt today in every debate and negotiation, in the\r\ncomposition and election of the main bodies and positions\r\nin the United Nations, and in every peacekeeping operation.\r\nThere is no problem more pressing, practical or concrete\r\nfor the United Nations today than that of serving the\r\nlegitimate interests of all its States Members, so that it does\r\nnot become a hostage to or a tool of any one of them.\r\nIt would be physically impossible to cover, in just one\r\nspeech, the whole range of ideas contained in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General. We are glad that this important\r\ndocument contains certain assertions which, in our view,\r\nrepresent an objective assessment of the successes and\r\nfailures in the work of the United Nations at this stage in\r\nits history. I will therefore confine myself to commenting\r\non the work of the Organization during this period and\r\nexpressing our views on some ideas that have prevailed in\r\nits everyday activity.\r\nThe so-called financial crisis still exists, but its causes\r\nhave now been clearly identified. It has become clear that\r\nit is a payments crisis, and that the political conditions\r\nimposed on such payments are unacceptable. The question\r\nis therefore whether the United Nations has the political\r\ncapacity to make the country with the largest economy in\r\nthe world, which is also the greatest beneficiary of the\r\nexistence of this Organization, honour its commitments\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nin full, on time and without conditions.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nThe conflicts that have cast a pall over the world,\r\nand which call for the attention of the United Nations,\r\nhave not diminished. However, that is not because, apart\r\nfrom current financial constraints, the Organization has\r\nnot allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping\r\noperations; it is because it has not come to grips with the\r\nreal causes of conflicts, and because artificial solutions\r\nhave so often been imposed which, far from fostering a\r\nnegotiated and objective settlement of conflicts, have been\r\ndictated by hegemonic interests. Peacekeeping operations\r\nhave grown increasingly complex. The world is shaken by\r\nconflicts that are developing within the borders of\r\nsovereign States. In this respect the United Nations will\r\nface failure today and in the future so long as it continues\r\nto ignore the root causes and nature of internal conflicts\r\nand to be guided by philosophies that regard sovereignty\r\nand sovereign equality to be out of date, no matter how\r\nmuch money the advocates of such ideas may possess or\r\nhow clever they may be at bookkeeping.\r\nThe disquieting decrease in resources allocated for\r\ndevelopment persists, but the origin of this situation does\r\nnot lie in the lack of programmes or the absence of an\r\nagenda for development. The real causes of this\r\nphenomenon lie in the lack of political will to promote\r\ndevelopment on a worldwide scale. Developing countries\r\ncannot delegate to other international actors the primary\r\nresponsibility that should be assumed by the United\r\nNations as the real manager of international cooperation.\r\nThe reduction of the resources allocated for\r\ndevelopment is also a result of the fact that, although the\r\nrelationship between peace and development is rightly\r\nnoted by most of the world, it has hardly become the\r\nmotto of the developed countries. This is unfortunate.\r\nThis phenomenon is also a result of the fact that some\r\nMember States insist on preaching that the right to\r\ndevelopment, an incipient institution of international law,\r\nshould not be subject to the needed codification. They\r\nalso seek to silence the international community’s\r\nrejection of disorder and inequality in international\r\neconomic relations and in the imposition of conditions for\r\ndevelopment cooperation.\r\nWe support the entire statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Colombia on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, especially the proposal that development be\r\ndiscussed in a separate chapter of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nThe institutional and structural imbalance of the\r\nOrganization is growing. However, this cannot be attributed\r\nto lack of analysis or of radical approaches to the issue.\r\nLegitimate and reasonable proposals genuinely to strengthen\r\nand revitalize the functions of the General Assembly have\r\nmet only with resistance and have been answered by\r\ncompromise solutions and conditions that offer the\r\nelimination of items from the agenda as the only viable\r\nalternative.\r\nNecessary reform of the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and improvement in its methods and working\r\nprocedures continue to be priority issues for most Member\r\nStates. However, the Working Group entrusted with this\r\nmatter will not be in a position during this session to\r\nsubmit a report reflecting progress in its work. This is\r\nbecause of the lack of flexibility of certain delegations,\r\nwhich continue to approach such reform from a\r\ndiscriminatory perspective that is incompatible with the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of all States.\r\nWe cannot speak of genuine reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, the Economic and Social Council or any other\r\nbody as long as some Member States insist on keeping the\r\nanachronistic privilege of the veto — or even the threat to\r\nuse the veto, which has become a sort of concealed veto\r\nused to avoid public consequences — or on maintaining a\r\ndouble standard whereby all States are equal, but some are\r\nmore equal than others.\r\nCuba agrees with the Secretary-General with regard to\r\nthe long deliberations that have taken place in the\r\nframework of the Informal Open-ended Working Group on\r\nan Agenda for Peace. However, it is precisely the sensitive\r\nand controversial nature of the ideas being considered in\r\nthose deliberations that make it necessary objectively and\r\nimpartially to reflect the various trends and positions that\r\nhave emerged from that Working Group. It would be\r\ncounterproductive to try to promote definitions, ideas and\r\ntrends that have been rejected by a significant number of\r\nStates in the Working Group. We might agree with the\r\nassertion contained in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nthat\r\n“Member States continue to attach importance to\r\npreventive diplomacy and peacemaking as the most\r\ncost-effective ways” (A/51/1, para. 651)\r\nof dealing with disputes.\r\nNonetheless, we should also point out that, contrary to\r\nthis view, many States have expressed their opinions on\r\nsuch ways and means — or “alternatives” — from a\r\nsubstantive, comprehensive and critical perspective.\r\nCuba believes that preventive diplomacy and\r\npeacemaking cannot be conceived or applied on the basis\r\nof cost-benefit analysis, especially given that it has not\r\nbeen possible to reach consensus on the definition of any\r\nof these concepts. We must recognize that, in the\r\nopinion of many Member States, preventive diplomacy\r\nand peacemaking should be conceived solely as\r\ndiplomatic means to prevent the escalation of a dispute\r\nand its possible development into a conflict. Cuba\r\nassociates itself with this position.\r\nFurthermore, we understand that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s ideas on such concepts as preventive\r\ndeployment or preventive action and the possible\r\nreplacement of the Organization’s diplomatic efforts with\r\npreventive action, have not yet been negotiated\r\nsubstantively, and have not yet received the necessary\r\nconsensus. It is clear that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral does not place the necessary emphasis on the\r\nprinciple of consent — a principle that many of us define\r\nas a cornerstone of any United Nations diplomatic\r\ninitiative, an element which should always prevail over\r\nany attempts to implement or impose an artificial peace\r\nthat might derive from or turn into an act of interference\r\nin the internal affairs of a sovereign State.\r\nThose are our comments on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization. We\r\ndisagree with some aspects of the document, as well as\r\nwith some of the ideas and trends supported in it.\r\nHowever, we support the Secretary-General’s approach to\r\nmany issues, although we believe that important aspects\r\nof the work of the Organization have been left out of the\r\nreport or are stated without having been arrived at by\r\nconsensus.\r\nCuba believes that the United Nations of the twenty-\r\nfirst century will be effective only to the extent that its\r\nobjectives and actions succeed in striking the right\r\nbalance between the solidity and validity of the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter and its concerted response to\r\ncurrent and future challenges.\r\nThe United Nations will not be strong and effective\r\nif it allows cardinal principles of international law, such\r\nas respect for sovereignty, the territorial integrity of States\r\nand the right of States freely to choose their political,\r\neconomic and social system, to succumb to unilateral\r\npolitical interests and the imposition of models.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nCuba is ready to make its contribution, in a spirit of\r\nconstructiveness and flexibility, to the United Nations of the\r\nfuture so as to enable it truly to respond to the interests of\r\nall its sovereign and equal Members.\r\nMr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): My statement will be brief.\r\nAt the outset, the Chinese delegation would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his annual report on the\r\nwork of the Organization. The report reviews the work of\r\nthe Organization and the progress it has made in various\r\nfields over the past year. It also identifies the problems and\r\ndifficulties confronting it. We wish to take this opportunity\r\nto pay tribute to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nfor his commendable and tireless efforts in fulfilling the\r\nmission entrusted to him by this Organization and in\r\nenhancing the role of the United Nations. We also wish to\r\ntake this opportunity to thank the staff of the Secretariat for\r\ntheir hard work despite the shortage of financial and human\r\nresources.\r\nLast year, we gathered here solemnly to commemorate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. The leaders\r\nof all the countries that participated once again reaffirmed\r\ntheir commitment to the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter and expressed their readiness to help the United\r\nNations better to meet the challenges of the new century.\r\nOver the past year, this Organization has made many efforts\r\nto alleviate regional conflicts, bring the question of social\r\ndevelopment to the attention of the international community\r\nand push forward its own reforms. However, there are also\r\ndisturbing trends: The question of development fails to get\r\ndue attention, the financial difficulties of the United Nations\r\nare increasing and the role of the United Nations is being\r\nweakened.\r\nPeace and development are the two most important\r\nissues in the world today. Given the current international\r\nsituation, the question of development, particularly in the\r\nvast number of developing countries, has increasingly come\r\nto the fore. Preventing conflicts, restoring stability,\r\neradicating poverty and achieving the objectives of social\r\ndevelopment are, without exception, closely linked to\r\neconomic development. The United Nations has a unique\r\nand important role to play in the field of development.\r\nHowever, recent years have witnessed a further decline in\r\nthe position of the United Nations in the economic and\r\ndevelopment fields, as is shown by the shortage of funds\r\nand the shrinking operations of United Nations development\r\nagencies. In the past year, the level of resources made\r\navailable for development, including through the United\r\nNations system, has continued to drop. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance from the developed countries has\r\ndeclined even further, year by year, to a mere 0.27 per\r\ncent in 1995, a level far below the United Nations target\r\nof 0.7 per cent. This is an important issue, and United\r\nNations assistance is required to promote the economic\r\ndevelopment of all countries, particularly the developing\r\nones, and to eradicate poverty. The role of the United\r\nNations in the field of development should therefore be\r\nstrengthened rather than weakened. The United Nations\r\nwill be able to prove itself worthy of its name in the\r\ntwenty-first century only when it treats development\r\nissues in the same way as it treats international conflicts.\r\nThe financial crisis of the United Nations is another\r\npressing issue that merits our attention. In recent years,\r\nthe Organization has been shrouded in the shadow of a\r\nfinancial crisis. According to the latest Secretariat\r\nstatistics, as of early September this year Member States\r\nowed the Organization over $2.9 billion, of which $1.6\r\nbillion were owed by the largest contributor. The serious\r\nfinancial difficulties confronting the Organization have\r\nnot only hampered its effective operation, but also\r\nimpaired its reputation. The financial crisis is, in the final\r\nanalysis, a payment crisis resulting from delayed payment\r\nby a few Member States — in particular the major\r\ncontributor — of their assessed contributions to the\r\nregular and peacekeeping budgets. It is obviously\r\nunjustifiable for a certain major contributor to withhold\r\npayment of its assessed contributions on the basis of the\r\nneed for reform of the United Nations, a position that has\r\nnaturally met with wide opposition from Member States.\r\nThe practice of making irresponsible remarks and\r\nunwarranted accusations against the United Nations on the\r\none hand and, on the other, withholding the payment of\r\nassessed contributions to the United Nations over a long\r\nperiod, is of no help at all to genuine reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. We urge the countries concerned to fulfil\r\ntheir financial obligations as set out in the Charter by\r\nunconditionally paying in full without further delay.\r\nIt is the need of our era as well as the desire of the\r\ngeneral membership to carry out appropriate and rational\r\nreform of the United Nations. In the past year, the\r\nrelevant working groups of the General Assembly have\r\nconducted useful discussions on various aspects of\r\nreform. The ultimate aim of United Nations reform is not\r\nreform itself and should not be construed as merely\r\nstreamlining the administrative structure, cutting\r\nexpenditure and reducing staff. What is more important is\r\nfor reform to enable the United Nations to adapt itself\r\nbetter to changes and development in the world situation,\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nso as more effectively to achieve the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter and play a more positive role in\r\npromoting peace and development, thereby better serving\r\nthe entire membership. In brief, the structure and scale of\r\nthe United Nations should be suited to its mandates.\r\nReform not only involves the future of the United\r\nNations, but is also closely linked to the interests of the\r\nentire membership. It should be emphasized that major\r\nreform plans for all areas of the United Nations, including\r\nthe Secretariat, should be subject to full discussion by the\r\ngeneral membership and confirmed and endorsed by the\r\nmajority of Member States, rather than formulated\r\naccording to the will of a small number of countries, still\r\nless to that of one single country. Only in that way can\r\nreform be successful and its objectives achieved.\r\nIn recent years, the United Nations has played a\r\npositive role in alleviating and resolving conflicts and has\r\nalso made useful efforts in trying to consolidate peace and\r\nprevent the recurrence of conflicts. We expect the United\r\nNations to make greater efforts to address the deep-rooted\r\ncauses of conflicts. At the same time, it should be\r\nemphasized that we are living in a world of diversity.\r\nCountries differ from one another in their social systems,\r\nvalues, level of development, historical tradition, religious\r\nbelief and cultural background. Without diversity, there can\r\nbe no world as we know it; and without diversity, there can\r\nbe no United Nations. The United Nations must have a\r\nclear understanding of this situation and base its\r\npeacemaking and peace-building practices on it.\r\nThe United Nations has followed an unusual course\r\nfor half a century. It remains the most important\r\nintergovernmental and international Organization in the\r\nworld today and its role in international, political and\r\neconomic life is unique and indispensable, although, as a\r\nresult of its various failures and difficulties, its\r\nachievements still fall short of the expectations of all\r\ncountries. The United Nations needs our support just as we\r\nneed it to exist. The Chinese delegation hopes that\r\nconsideration of the report of the Secretary-General will\r\nhelp Member States to summarize more cogently the\r\nexperience of the United Nations and define further its\r\nmain tasks so that it can live up to the expectations of all\r\ncountries by better accomplishing the solemn mission\r\nentrusted to it.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): Allow me to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his detailed report. It highlights the priorities\r\nset by Member States for the Organization and analyses the\r\nmanner in which it is meeting these identified needs.\r\nEmerging political, social and economic situations\r\ncontinue to challenge our Organization. Yet the United\r\nNations remains the only forum in which Member States\r\nmeet daily to deliberate on issues. As problems become\r\nmore complex, the greater becomes the need for this\r\nforum, in which States formulate and pledge their\r\nrequired cooperation. The inability of most societies to\r\ncontain or address certain issues purely within their\r\nnational boundaries has given renewed impetus to our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThese evolving needs now pose an institutional\r\nchallenge requiring adaptation. The report details the\r\nreform measures already introduced. Reform has been and\r\nis still under way. Individual instances of streamlining\r\nrequire a clear perception of the ultimate objective of\r\nsuch exercises. The focus of our efforts should remain the\r\nvision that inspires and guides reform. The core principles\r\nthat formed the base on which the United Nations was\r\nfounded are the measures by which we assess the success\r\nand weakness of our Organization. They remain our\r\nbeacons.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General has grown\r\nconsiderably longer over the years. This is partly due to\r\nthe increase in areas serviced by the United Nations, but\r\nit is also a response to the call for transparency. The\r\nreport is not a mere checklist to put on record the efforts\r\nof the Organization and its Member States. It is an\r\nopportunity to be introspective, to analyse our\r\nundertakings more closely and to identify what needs to\r\nbe buttressed and what needs to be streamlined. It\r\nindicates our willingness to examine how our mandate\r\nmay be put into action more effectively to benefit the\r\npeoples who form the international community.\r\nThe human imperative has transformed the United\r\nNations into a symbol of hope for millions. The\r\nSecretary-General stresses the equal importance of our\r\ncommitment to building a global society that rests on\r\nsocial justice and the continued assistance of the United\r\nNations to the victims of man-made or natural disasters.\r\nPeacekeeping and conflict prevention are essential\r\nelements of this engagement. The details provided by the\r\nSecretary-General are a stark reminder that the world\r\ncommunity cannot limit its action to providing assistance\r\nonly during or in the immediate aftermath of disaster.\r\nThere are innumerable instances of tragic situations\r\nthat fail to attract the continued attention of the media\r\neven though the suffering of millions persists. The United\r\nNations has kept alive its consistent commitment to these\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nvictims, be they the populations affected by the Chernobyl\r\ncatastrophe, Somali or Palestinian refugees or those who\r\nlive the daily agony of extreme poverty and exclusion.\r\nAs the Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Edward Fenech\r\nAdami, said at the World Summit for Social Development,\r\n“The tasks ahead are not easy, but the cry of\r\nmillions of infants worldwide whose lives are\r\nthreatened by hunger should be enough to consolidate\r\nour resolve. Our commitment is a debt owed to future\r\ngenerations.”\r\nAwareness needs to be translated into the will to engage.\r\nThat is what the United Nations is doing.\r\nThe development of international humanitarian law\r\nreflects our commitment to containing the impact of war.\r\nThis aspect of the Organization’s work requires constant\r\nattention and further focus. It stems from the innate dignity\r\nof each human being, which inspires the laws of all nations\r\nand the United Nations in particular. The promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights is another key aspect of this\r\nhumanitarian imperative. This important hallmark of United\r\nNations commitment has changed the international\r\nenvironment. This focus on human rights has been\r\ninstrumental in demolishing the walls behind which\r\nauthoritarian regimes that trampled upon human dignity\r\nsought to hide. It has inspired and enabled us to combat the\r\nviolation of human rights and to restore social justice,\r\nfreedom and progress.\r\nRio de Janeiro, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing\r\nand Istanbul have become landmarks in our common search\r\nto consolidate our commitment to furthering the right to\r\ndignity, justice and development for all human beings. The\r\nfollow-up to these recent United Nations conferences\r\nremains central to undertakings by our Organization.\r\nEffective action to realize the provisions of agreed\r\nplatforms requires not only the means but also the\r\nstreamlining of effort and activity. The Secretary-General\r\nlists many instances in which United Nations offices have\r\npooled resources and cooperated on projects. Such efforts\r\nare welcome; ultimately they yield better results.\r\nSimilarly, the section on joint programmes for\r\ndevelopment outlines the varied manner in which the\r\nUnited Nations has addressed this important aspect of its\r\nmandate. Together with the rule of law and respect for\r\nhuman rights, development is and remains a major focus in\r\nthe promotion of peace and prosperity. Freedom from want\r\nis a vital aspect of this humanitarian imperative.\r\nIn the introduction to his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral underlines the importance of renewal and reform.\r\nThe commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations provided Member States with the\r\nopportunity collectively to renew their commitment to the\r\nCharter and to underline the need for a process of\r\nsustained reform. In his statement to the Open-ended\r\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations System, the Secretary-General rightly\r\npointed out that\r\n“reform — indeed change in the Organization —\r\nshould be perceived not as an imposition, not as\r\ncompromising the objectives of the Charter, but as\r\nadapting structures and methods to the new global\r\nenvironment that the Organization has helped to\r\nbring about.” (A/51/1, para. 6)\r\nThe measure by which the system’s functions may\r\nbe assessed is the Charter. It establishes the principles on\r\nwhich our work is based, guided and furthered. These\r\nprinciples survived the cold war. They inspired social and\r\neconomic progress, the protection of human rights and\r\njustice and security. They should continue to guide us in\r\nour new, changed and challenging international\r\nenvironment.\r\nAs we review and renew the structures of our\r\nOrganization, an expanded Security Council and a\r\nrevitalized General Assembly remain institutional\r\npriorities. Consensus-building is a key to the achievement\r\nof progress in these two important areas of reform. The\r\nrisks that procrastination carries are many. International\r\npeace and security is confronted by new, complex threats\r\nthat make its maintenance — the primary responsibility of\r\nthe Security Council — more difficult. Inflexible\r\npositions will not assist us in making progress.\r\nEqually important is the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of States, which is fundamental to this\r\nOrganization and particularly to the role of the General\r\nAssembly. The process of the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly and its enhanced relationship with the Security\r\nCouncil should not be held hostage to agreement in other\r\ndistinct areas.\r\nCooperation on the institutional level helps avoid\r\nduplication. It is cost-effective and provides an\r\nopportunity for enhanced sharing of information and\r\nexpertise. It gives us the opportunity better to identify\r\nproblem areas — those that overlap or are not addressed\r\nat all. Recent enhancement of cooperation between the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil is one such example.\r\nThere is a need to apply such a coordinated approach\r\nto areas of the common heritage of humankind. This\r\nconcept, based on the principle of trust, is an integral part\r\nof a number of conventions and resolutions that ascribe\r\nresponsibility for different areas of common heritage to\r\nspecific international institutions. Malta believes that the\r\nTrusteeship Council should be entrusted with such\r\ncoordination — an initiative first launched by the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister of Malta, Mr. Guido de Marco, when he\r\nwas President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth\r\nsession.\r\nAt the fiftieth session, Malta submitted a draft\r\nresolution on the review of the role of the Trusteeship\r\nCouncil, which was later adopted by the General Assembly.\r\nMember States were requested to submit their views on the\r\nfuture of the Council, which several did. Our proposal is\r\nbased on the necessity to preserve the institutional balance\r\nwithin the Organization — a balance that preserves the\r\nbasic principles on which the Charter was founded. The\r\nTrusteeship Council, a principal organ of the United\r\nNations, should continue to exist because of its present\r\npotential under the Charter, the principles of which it is\r\ndepositary, with regard to current and emerging realities.\r\nMalta’s proposal has prompted a range of opinions and\r\nviews. Aware of the time it takes for ideas to mature and\r\nconsensus to emerge, we look forward to further discussion.\r\nLater this month the world community will witness the\r\ninauguration of the International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea — the fruit of a long negotiating process and proof\r\nof the world community’s will and persistence in fostering\r\ncooperation and resolving the complex issues codified by\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThis same will and persistence should remain with us\r\nas we address and map out cooperation in other complex\r\nareas, ranging from trans-boundary pollution to drug\r\ntrafficking, and from overfishing to money laundering.\r\nEnhanced codification of international law is a means by\r\nwhich States are given the tools not only to exercise\r\nrestraint, but also to find recourse to mechanisms for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. The United Nations has\r\nbeen and remains the unique forum for such cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads. As we move\r\ninto the next millennium, the vision of a world at peace,\r\nwhich inspires our action, requires constant renewal to\r\nensure present and future generations their share of dignity,\r\nsocial justice and freedom. This Organization has\r\nprovided the inspiration and means for the birth, survival\r\nand growth of States. It has been and continues to be the\r\nmain forum in which the principles that guide the\r\nbehaviour of States develop and evolve.\r\nDuring the past 50 years, many people have\r\nexamined the United Nations and questioned its existence\r\nand performance. No one has ever called into question the\r\nneed for a continued commitment to the principles that\r\ngave birth to the United Nations. Those principles remain\r\nat the core of our daily effort.\r\nThe spirit of solidarity that bonds human beings and\r\nsocieties has helped us to overcome obstacles and\r\nchallenges to peace. It is this same spirit that continues to\r\nunite our nations.\r\nMr. Blukis (Latvia): My delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and future-oriented report on the work of\r\nthe Organization. The report deserves an exhaustive\r\nanalysis, but that is not a practical choice for one\r\ndelegation. However, the Prime Minister of Latvia, in his\r\nstatement to the Assembly on 24 September 1996,\r\npresented the views of Latvia on matters pertaining to the\r\nmajor substantive categories covered by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report.\r\nThis supplementary statement can therefore be brief.\r\nIt is a response to the information on United Nations\r\nreform presented in chapters I, II and V of the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General. It also takes into account relevant\r\ninformation presented in the recently issued progress\r\nreport of the Efficiency Board to the Secretary-General,\r\nas well as the even more recent comments thereon by the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Administration and\r\nManagement.\r\nIn paragraphs 8 to 16 of his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral describes what has been accomplished at three\r\nlevels of institutional reform: intergovernmental,\r\norganizational and managerial. My delegation will\r\ncomment on the state of reforms on the intergovernmental\r\nlevel, a matter the Secretary-General barely touches upon,\r\nsince these reforms are outside his sphere of\r\nresponsibility.\r\nMy delegation agrees with previous speakers that\r\nreforms on the intergovernmental level lag behind reforms\r\non the organizational and managerial levels. It is the\r\nresponsibility of the relevant intergovernmental bodies, in\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nparticular this Assembly, to remedy the lag. I will make\r\nseveral suggestions in this regard that the General\r\nAssembly might find useful. First, the General Assembly\r\nshould examine the possibility of establishing a system of\r\nself-management that, like the management of the\r\nSecretariat, would be mission-driven and results-oriented, in\r\nplace of the present procedure-driven and resolution-\r\noriented system.\r\nSecondly, priority should be given to reaching a\r\nframework agreement or separate agreements for different\r\nreform areas on the general shape of the reforms of\r\nintergovernmental bodies that are to be implemented in the\r\nforeseeable future. A framework agreement or agreements\r\ncould guide the further work of the working groups that are\r\ndealing with reform.\r\nTo date, the working groups have devoted most of\r\ntheir efforts to gathering and examining the details, or\r\nbricks, from which reform could be built. What is missing\r\nis the plan or framework needed to decide which bricks are\r\nnecessary and what kind of bricks have yet to be found or\r\nmade in order to build reform. My delegation sincerely\r\nhopes that other delegations will seriously examine these\r\nsuggestions and offers its cooperation.\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium) (interpretation from French): As\r\nthe General Assembly considers the report on the work of\r\nthe Organization, for which I thank the Secretary-General\r\nand the Secretariat, I wish to emphasize some of the topics\r\nthat my Government considers especially important.\r\nFirst of all, I wish to confirm that we fully endorse the\r\nSecretary-General’s assessment that, in an international\r\nsystem that has once again become multipolar, the\r\nOrganization itself is in the process of radical change and\r\nits future, more than ever, depends on improving the way\r\nit is financed and functions. In this respect, implementation\r\nof the plan for general management reform will play a\r\ndecisive role. We have noted the efforts made under\r\ndifficult conditions by the Secretariat in the areas of cost\r\nstructure, human resources, information and technology, for\r\nwhich we are grateful.\r\nIn order to guarantee the long-term future of the\r\nUnited Nations as it goes through the necessary changes,\r\nwe must also make sure that it is financially sound. In this\r\nregard, reform and financing have to go hand in hand. The\r\nobligation of all Member States to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions in full, on time and without conditions, and to\r\npay their arrears must be respected. Naturally, we may\r\nconsider adapting means of payment, in a way yet to be\r\ndetermined, in cases where it may be necessary. Certainty\r\nof payment will, moreover, allow us to avoid a situation\r\nin which the Secretary-General has to resort to perilous\r\nfinancial operations to maintain a shaky budgetary\r\nbalance. In addition, the uncertainty that weighs over the\r\nfinancing of peacekeeping operations may pose problems\r\nfor United Nations troop-contributing countries. Finally,\r\nwe hope to be able to count on the universal will to adapt\r\nfinancing machinery to the realities of today.\r\nPredictability of resources and the balanced apportionment\r\nof contributions are the two pillars of the new, healthy\r\nfinancial basis that our Organization needs so badly.\r\nAs I had the opportunity to remind the Assembly\r\nlast year, my Government is following with great\r\nattention the efforts to adapt United Nations bodies and\r\ninstruments to the challenges of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. For sure, progress has been made. The\r\nSecretary-General has noted that progress in his report.\r\nWe nonetheless feel that refocusing the activity of the\r\nagencies and funds of the United Nations must continue\r\nand that the coordination of development activities, both\r\nat Headquarters and in the field, can be improved further.\r\nWe fully support the proposals made by the European\r\nUnion in these fields and we hope that work on an\r\nAgenda for Development and the implementation of the\r\nproposals contained in resolution 50/227 on the\r\nrestructuring and revitalization of the Organization in the\r\neconomic and social fields will lead to concrete results at\r\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. We have\r\nalso noted with great interest the importance the\r\nSecretary-General attaches to the problems of\r\ndevelopment: global development, as described in his\r\nreport, in particular development in Africa. We believe\r\nthat the mid-term review conducted a few weeks ago is\r\nproof that Member States share the same concern.\r\nThe role of the United Nations with regard to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\r\nincreased substantially in recent years. The Organization\r\nwill continue to be called on to maintain peace, in\r\nconflicts both between States and within States. This\r\ndevelopment has led us to supplement traditional\r\npeacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that\r\nincorporates political, economic, social and humanitarian\r\ncomponents within the framework of what is now known\r\nas preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General\r\nhas quite rightly baptized as “preventive action”. This is\r\nnot really a new concept, but the multidimensional\r\napproach, on the other hand, deserves our full attention.\r\nNo matter how attractive they are, preventive diplomacy\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nand preventive action will probably not always be possible.\r\nIn our view, respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms is one of the areas for action in preventive\r\ndiplomacy. Like many, if not all Governments, our\r\nGovernment remains highly committed to the principle of\r\nthe universality of human rights as the World Conference\r\non Human Rights in Vienna reminded us in 1993. Ensuring\r\nrespect for these rights — and here we do not just mean in\r\nconflict situations, but also and mainly in countries in times\r\nof peace — is the primary responsibility of Member States\r\nand their Governments before the international community.\r\nIn this respect, existing United Nations machinery deserves\r\nour support, not least in terms of financing. Furthermore, a\r\nspecial effort should be made with regard to international\r\nhumanitarian law, which has been systematically trampled\r\nupon in recent years. I am talking not about preparing new\r\ntexts or new treaties, but quite simply about the most\r\nelementary respect for existing law.\r\nOne of the most outstanding results of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations has undoubtedly been the signing by a large\r\nnumber of States from all regional groups of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. My country\r\nwelcomes this and we urge all United Nations Member\r\nStates to sign and ratify this Treaty, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral quite rightly called an historic landmark. But we\r\nalso share his disappointment at the poor results of the\r\nReview Conference of the States Parties to the Convention\r\non Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\r\nConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be\r\nExcessively Injurious and its work on Protocol II. Belgium\r\nwill work unremittingly to achieve a complete ban on the\r\nproduction, use and export of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to emphasize\r\nthe usefulness of this report and its consolidated and\r\nforward-looking approach, which will help us set the\r\nparameters to guide our work at the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAs the Assembly debates the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization today, my\r\ndelegation feels that it is only fair to pay tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for several\r\noutstanding achievements. First, we in Kuwait view with\r\nadmiration and pride the efficient manner in which the\r\nSecretary-General guides this vital institution, which has a\r\nsignificant and direct impact on international and human\r\nrelations. We would like to place on record our full\r\nappreciation for the enormous efforts he has made and\r\ncontinues to make with a view to streamlining and\r\nenhancing the efficiency of the United Nations, which\r\nwas created to promote peace, security and development\r\nby fulfilling the aspirations of all humankind in those\r\nareas.\r\nThe significance of the report before us today cannot\r\nbe overemphasized, since it outlines in perceptive detail\r\nthe full spectrum of United Nations activities and\r\nprogrammes, including the reform of the Organization’s\r\nadministrative structures, development and humanitarian\r\nactivities, and the prevention, control and resolution of\r\ninternational disputes. The timing of discussions on this\r\nreport is well chosen, as it comes immediately after the\r\ngeneral debate in the plenary meetings of the Assembly.\r\nMr. Nsanze (Burundi), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThus, Member States can analyse and evaluate the\r\nfunctions of the General Assembly and the means\r\navailable to it for fulfilling its mandates through the\r\nSecretariat. This will ultimately enable Member States to\r\ndefine their positions or their priority concerns in the\r\ncontext of the General Assembly’s scope and functions.\r\nThe importance we attach to the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the work of the Organization can be explained\r\nby the wealth of information it contains and by its\r\nperceptive analyses of the issues and international\r\ndisputes being dealt with by the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community. Today, I should like to draw\r\nattention to the case of my own country, which is of great\r\nconcern to the United Nations, as the Secretary-General\r\nnotes in chapter IV, section D of his report, “Current\r\nactivities in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and\r\npeacekeeping,” under item 16, “Iraq-Kuwait.” In this\r\nconnection I would note that the Secretary-General\r\ndeplores Iraq’s continuing failure to comply with a\r\nnumber of Security Council resolutions, especially those\r\ncalling upon it to release Kuwaiti and third-country\r\nnationals being held as prisoners and hostages and its\r\nfailure to return Kuwaiti property seized by Iraq during its\r\nbarbaric occupation of my country.\r\nThe Secretary-General also expresses his concern\r\nover the non-compliance by the Government of Iraq with\r\nthe demands and obligations set forth in relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, and he states:\r\n“It is a matter of great concern to me that more than\r\n600 Kuwaiti and third-country nationals are still\r\nmissing in Iraq, and I once again call upon Iraq to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\ncomply fully with its obligations in this regard.”\r\n(A/51/1, para. 829)\r\nWith regard to the Kuwaiti property seized by Iraq,\r\nthe Secretary-General says:\r\n“The return of property seized by Iraq to Kuwait is\r\nanother of Iraq’s obligations. ... Of particular concern\r\nto me are those items which are irreplaceable,\r\nincluding archives belonging to the Offices of the\r\nAmir, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Foreign\r\nMinistry. Other missing items of particular\r\nsignificance are properties belonging to Kuwait’s\r\nMinistry of Defence.” (ibid., para. 830)\r\nThe fact that the Secretary-General expresses his\r\npersonal concern over Iraq’s continued failure to comply\r\nwith its formal obligations under Security Council\r\nresolutions, especially with regard to prisoners, hostages\r\nand property, proves the importance of those issues, which\r\nKuwait has persistently stressed on all occasions and in all\r\nforums. Furthermore, the statement by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the Government of Iraq has failed to fulfil its\r\nobligations in regard to those two matters refutes the claims\r\nmade by high-ranking Iraqi officials that the release of\r\nKuwaiti hostages and the return of Kuwaiti property are\r\nobligations that Iraq has fulfilled and that Kuwait and the\r\nStates of the coalition have exaggerated their repeated\r\nclaims with a view to increasing pressure on the\r\nGovernment of Iraq and further isolating it. These are\r\nindeed priority issues, and Kuwait has constantly\r\nemphasized them as being the major yardstick to be used\r\nby members of the Security Council to ascertain the extent\r\nof Iraq’s compliance with its resolutions.\r\nMoving to facts on the ground, I should like to inform\r\nthe Assembly that Iraq has not as yet released one single\r\nKuwaiti prisoner, nor has it closed a single one of the\r\nprisoner-related dossiers that were submitted to the\r\nGovernment of Iraq some three years ago. In fact, Iraq is\r\ncontinuing to exploit for propaganda purposes its purported\r\ncooperation with the Tripartite Commission and its\r\ntechnical subcommittee, which are sparing no effort to\r\nresolve this issue. Instead of returning seized Kuwaiti\r\nproperty, Iraq is using certain items of that property to\r\nthreaten the sovereignty and stability of Kuwait. By that I\r\nmean Iraq’s use of some Kuwaiti military vehicles and\r\nhardware stolen in the military exercise carried out in\r\nOctober 1994.\r\nAccordingly, Kuwait once again calls upon the\r\nGovernment of Iraq to expedite the implementation of all\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, particularly those\r\nregarding the release without further delay of prisoners\r\nand hostages and the return of all stolen Kuwaiti property.\r\nIn closing, I wish to express once again our deep\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for his remarkable\r\nefforts in pursuing the long-standing goals of humankind,\r\nnamely, peace, security and development, as set forth in\r\nthe United Nations Charter. After all, the United Nations\r\nwas created to fulfil the aspirations of people to live in a\r\nharmonious and stable world.\r\nMr. Zlenko (Ukraine): The delegation of Ukraine\r\nnotes with satisfaction that today we are witnessing\r\nincreasingly perceptible efforts by the General Assembly\r\nto reform and modernize the United Nations, the goal set\r\nby the Heads of State and Government at the special\r\ncommemorative meeting held at the Assembly’s fiftieth\r\nsession.\r\nThis has been proved by intensive deliberations in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council, the Informal Open-\r\nended Working Group of the General Assembly on an\r\nAgenda for Peace, the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working\r\nGroup of the General Assembly on an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, the High-level Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Financial Situation of the United Nations and the\r\nOpen-Ended High-Level Working Group on the\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations System, all of which,\r\nwe hope, will bear positive results.\r\nToday, therefore, we can speak of some progress\r\nhaving been made within the framework of these Working\r\nGroups during the past year. Naturally, we do not mean\r\nthat a breakthrough has been achieved, but we are sure\r\nthat another step forward has been made.\r\nThe Informal Open-ended Working Group on an\r\nAgenda for Peace has continued its deliberations on the\r\nfour key areas it had identified, namely, preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking, post-conflict peace-building,\r\ncoordination and the question of sanctions imposed by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy delegation is grateful to the coordinators of each\r\nof the four sub-groups on those problems, namely, the\r\nrepresentatives of Australia, Singapore, Norway and\r\nBrazil, for their tireless efforts, and we state our full\r\nsupport for their commitment to achieving real progress\r\nin the work of those sub-groups.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nHowever, my delegation would like to comment on\r\nboth the form and the substance of deliberations in the\r\nWorking Group, in general, and in its sub-groups, in\r\nparticular.\r\nThe most important failure of the Informal Open-\r\nended Working Group, as we see it, was the lack of activity\r\non the part of delegations in elaborating and submitting\r\nspecific proposals and formulating conceptual approaches.\r\nUnfortunately, Member States relied mainly on the\r\ninnovative approach of the coordinators and, consequently,\r\nconcentrated on criticism of the drafts they had prepared.\r\nAs a result, many valuable ideas were not reflected in the\r\npapers presented.\r\nAt the same time, the coordinators of the subgroups\r\nwere unable to benefit from the suggestions submitted by\r\na number of delegations. Oddly enough, in elaborating their\r\npapers delegations strongly rejected using a scientific\r\napproach, which could have helped to solve many\r\nproblems. It is regrettable that delegations were not in a\r\nposition to reach agreement on such simple issues as actors,\r\ntypes and forms of preventive diplomacy and peacemaking\r\nand post-conflict peace-building.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction that the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and its Secretariat\r\nhave begun on their own to implement proposals made by\r\nMember States during the discussion of the Supplement to\r\nthe Agenda for Peace, not waiting for the results of the\r\nWorking Group’s deliberations. We welcome the creation\r\nwithin the Secretariat of a standing Oversight Group of\r\nsenior officers, which reviews potential and/or ongoing\r\ncrisis situations on the basis of information provided by the\r\ndesignated officers.\r\nThe Ukrainian delegation considers the creation of\r\nsuch a Group to be an important step towards the\r\nestablishment of a special group of experts on conflicts,\r\nwhich would not only monitor but would conduct early-\r\nwarning analysis and propose specific actions. My\r\ndelegation has repeatedly pointed out here the need to\r\nestablish such a group.\r\nWe cannot but support the Secretary-General’s\r\nconclusion that:\r\n“the prevention of conflicts through early warning,\r\nquiet diplomacy and, in some cases, preventive\r\ndeployment, is better than undertaking major politico-\r\nmilitary efforts to resolve conflicts after they have\r\nbroken out.” (A/51/1, para. 644)\r\nIn this context, I would draw attention to the\r\nproposal made by the President of Ukraine, Leonid\r\nKuchma, at the special commemorative meeting on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\r\nwith regard to the establishment of United Nations\r\ntrusteeship and monitoring of the development of\r\nprocesses in new and restored democracies in order to\r\nprevent the use of force and ensure respect for the\r\nestablished rules of international law. Such machinery\r\ncould draw upon the positive experience gained from the\r\nmonitoring of migration flows in countries of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and their\r\nvarious neighbouring countries by the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nInternational Organization for Migration and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE).\r\nUkraine has always understood the term “preventive\r\ndiplomacy” in a broader sense. Therefore, we welcome\r\nthe proposal of the Secretary-General with regard to\r\nchanging the term “preventive diplomacy” to “preventive\r\naction”. In fact, recent United Nations experience has\r\nshown that there are several other forms of action that can\r\nhave a useful preventive effect, namely, preventive\r\ndeployment, preventive disarmament, preventive arms\r\nembargo, preventive humanitarian action and so on.\r\nPreventive peace-building, in our view, also deserves\r\ndue attention and careful consideration. In this respect, we\r\nhope that the thought-provoking proposal of the\r\nSecretary-General will facilitate the successful completion\r\nof the work of the sub-groups on preventive diplomacy\r\nand post-conflict peace-building.\r\nI would like also to elaborate briefly on the issue of\r\neconomic sanctions imposed by the Security Council,\r\nwhich was the focus of work in one of the sub-groups.\r\nNotwithstanding the successful result of its work, as\r\nembodied in the agreed text of the document, the\r\ndelegation of Ukraine is not enthusiastic about the\r\ncontents. Unfortunately, one of the most important and\r\ncomplex issues — the negative impact of economic\r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council on third\r\nStates — was not even discussed in the sub-group. We\r\ncannot agree with that approach when unwillingness to\r\ndeal with the problem is motivated by lack of time or by\r\nthe problem’s complexity.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine does not find persuasive\r\nthe allusions to the fact that the issue is anticipated in the\r\nSixth Committee within the framework of discussions on\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nthe application of Article 50 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe problem of the negative impact of economic sanctions\r\nimposed by the Security Council has long ago outgrown\r\nArticle 50. It should be examined through the prism of\r\nstrengthening the effectiveness of such sanctions.\r\nThe inability of the world community to provide a\r\nswift and effective answer to the problems arising from the\r\napplication of sanctions threatens to undermine trust in the\r\nvery institution of sanctions. This, in turn, calls into\r\nquestion the principle of collective United Nations action in\r\nimplementing enforcement measures. In order to contribute\r\nto working out adequate approaches to solving the problem\r\nof the negative impact on third States of economic\r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council, the delegation\r\nof Ukraine has submitted for the consideration of Member\r\nStates an aide-mémoire on the position of Ukraine on the\r\nproblems of implementation of economic sanctions imposed\r\nby the Security Council (A/51/226). We regret that this\r\nimportant issue on the agenda of the Informal Open-ended\r\nWorking Group has not found a reflection in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization we\r\nare now discussing.\r\nThe financial crisis of the United Nations has reached\r\ndramatic proportions and taken on a chronic character. It\r\nhas become one of the main factors negatively affecting\r\nUnited Nations activities. Today, when the Organization is\r\nbeing called upon to play an entirely new role in\r\npeacemaking and in the maintenance of peace and security,\r\nin the promotion of sustainable development, in the\r\nimplementation of humanitarian operations and in the\r\nprotection of human rights, its existing financial system\r\nappears to be unable to provide it with the capacity or\r\nflexibility that would enable it to respond expeditiously to\r\nthe new challenges facing it.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine shares the view that\r\nensuring a viable financial base for the United Nations\r\ndepends in the first place on the political will and\r\ncommitment of Member States to meet their financial\r\nobligations in full and on time. At the same time, the\r\ndeepening of the financial crisis is an immediate result of\r\nour inability to find appropriate solutions to the complex\r\nissues raised in the framework of the High-level Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAll of us should demonstrate the political will to avoid\r\nmutual accusations and intolerance in the working\r\nprocedures of this important body. The financial\r\nrehabilitation of the Organization can be achieved only\r\nthrough joint effort. Ukraine supports the proposals aimed\r\nat reforming the United Nations financial mechanism,\r\nincluding the existing system of the apportionment of\r\nexpenses and the scale for peacekeeping operations. The\r\nfirst stage of their practical implementation should be the\r\nadoption of a draft resolution determining the parameters\r\nfor the formulation of the scale of assessments for the\r\nperiod 1998-2000 at the fifty-first regular — and I would\r\nrepeat the word “regular” — session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are deeply convinced that the achievement of\r\nconsensus on a draft resolution providing for the fair\r\napportionment of United Nations expenses among\r\nMember States would facilitate agreement on carrying out\r\nthe other elements of the financial reform. The efforts of\r\nsome Member States to promote other approaches only\r\ncomplicate the deliberations in the High-level Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Financial Situation of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine also expects that in\r\ndrawing up the provisions for financial reform adequate\r\naccount will be taken of the situation of those Member\r\nStates that have accumulated arrears for reasons beyond\r\ntheir control.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to assure the Assembly that the\r\ndelegation of Ukraine will continue to play an active and\r\nconstructive role in the efforts undertaken by the world\r\ncommunity to strengthen the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Rana (Nepal): We are pleased to see Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail of Malaysia presiding over the deliberations of the\r\nGeneral Assembly with dignity, firmness, dexterity and\r\nefficiency. I would venture to say that he has taken an\r\nimportant step in supplementing the ongoing reform\r\nprocess at the United Nations. He has the full cooperation\r\nand support of my delegation.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made\r\non behalf of the countries members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement today, a statement whose principal purpose, as\r\nwe understand it, is to assist the Secretary-General in the\r\npreparation of better and better reports in the future. We\r\nacknowledge without reservation that the present report,\r\nin its form and content, represents a distinct improvement\r\nover the reports of previous years.\r\nWe are of the view that the Secretary-General’s\r\nannual report is not only a report on the state of the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nOrganization but also a reflection on the activities of the\r\nSecretary-General during the year in all the areas outlined\r\nin Chapter XV of the Charter. In that light, it is clearly\r\nevident that Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali is an outstanding\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nThe delegation of Nepal is grateful for his tenacious\r\nand tireless efforts for peace. He has spared no effort to\r\nachieve better management of the Organization. As the\r\nForeign Minister of Nepal, Mr. Prakash Chandra Lohani,\r\nhas noted, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has succeeded in large\r\nmeasure in giving shape to the deliberations of the United\r\nNations through his far-reaching proposals in the Agendas\r\nfor Peace and for Development. His keen interest in the\r\nsocio-economic area, in the environment and in the fields\r\nof women, children and human rights is well known. No\r\none has more eloquently pleaded the case for democracy\r\nand human rights, better emphasized the need for greater\r\nhelp to the weaker and the needy, and been a stronger\r\nadvocate of the case of the developing countries — in\r\nparticular the least developed among them — than has the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nThe ongoing reform process of the United Nations\r\nmust take us in one direction, towards an Organization that\r\nis well equipped, financed and structured to serve\r\neffectively the purposes for which it was established. It\r\nmust not fail to serve the needs and aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the world in whose name the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations was signed. That was the vision of the\r\nHeads of State and Government of Member countries who\r\nassembled last year on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Organization. That continues to be our\r\nvision today.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): I would like to congratulate\r\nthe Secretary-General for the presentation of his fifth report\r\non the work of the Organization. The report successfully\r\ncaptures many of the broad trends in the evolution of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the United\r\nNations is in the midst of a dramatic transformation. This\r\nprocess of transformation and transition has not been\r\nsmooth. The United Nations has been attempting for many\r\nyears now to put in place a workable and enduring\r\ninternational system.\r\nAlthough some forward movement has been made, the\r\nrole of the United Nations in the post-cold-war period has\r\nto be more clearly understood and defined. New patterns of\r\ninternational cooperation are emerging. Some attempts are\r\nbeing made to redefine the very purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter. The greatest threat to the United Nations\r\ntoday is the trend towards neo-isolationism and\r\nneo-provincialism. Poor nations of the world are being\r\ntold to solve their economic problems themselves. Nations\r\nlocked into conflicts are being left at the mercy of\r\npowerful aggressors. The United Nations must reverse\r\nthese dangerous trends.\r\nThe Secretary-General has reported that the\r\nvoluntary resources coming into United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes have declined over the last year. The flow of\r\nofficial development assistance from Organisation for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\r\ncountries has declined to 0.27 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct as against the agreed United Nations target of\r\n0.7 per cent.\r\nIn order to build the foundations of peace, we should\r\nnot undermine the crucial aspect of development. Within\r\nthe framework of the deliberations for the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, we must intensify our efforts to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation and to enhance the role and\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to meet this challenge.\r\nWe endorse the Secretary-General’s view that the\r\nbest course of action for preventing and resolving\r\nconflicts is through preventive diplomacy and preventive\r\ndeployment in order to avoid costly politico-military\r\noperations. Preventive diplomacy can take many forms,\r\nincluding quiet diplomacy, early warning and activation\r\nof the existing United Nations mechanisms of mediation\r\nand arbitration. Preventive diplomacy has to be translated\r\ninto preventive action. It should be a proactive policy and\r\nnot a passive or belated response to conflicts after they\r\nhave erupted. The United Nations should play its primary\r\nrole of facilitating peaceful settlement of disputes between\r\nparties, no party being given a veto in imposing its will\r\nor in offering arbitrary justifications for illegal actions.\r\nPakistan believes that United Nations peacekeeping\r\nexemplifies the sustained political commitment of\r\nMember States to the concept of collective security and\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWithin the framework of the United Nations Charter,\r\npeacekeeping is a crucial element in addressing the root\r\ncauses of conflicts and in promoting reconciliation\r\nbetween the parties.\r\nDespite enormous difficulties and the heavy costs\r\ninvolved, Pakistan has been in the forefront of United\r\nNations peacekeeping efforts. We are one of the very few\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\ncountries who have strongly advocated a United Nations\r\npeacekeeping role, and even offered our services in areas of\r\nhigh risk. At present Pakistan is the largest troop-\r\ncontributing country in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. We are therefore fully aware of the great\r\ndifficulties, referred to in the Secretary General’s report,\r\nregarding peacekeeping operations and resources. It is\r\nindeed ironic that the financial crisis of the Organization\r\nhas hit troop contributors from the developing countries.\r\nTroop contributors should not be made to finance the\r\nshortfalls that result from the failure of some Member\r\nStates to pay their own assessed contributions.\r\nIn his 1994 annual report, the Secretary-General noted\r\nthat Jammu and Kashmir was one of the oldest unresolved\r\nconflicts still on the United Nations agenda. The United\r\nNations oldest peacekeeping operation, the United Nations\r\nMilitary Observer Group in India and Pakistan\r\n(UNMOGIP), has been continuing its efforts to monitor the\r\nceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir since 1949. In his\r\nreport, the Secretary-General warned that the level of\r\ntension in Jammu and Kashmir had increased considerably\r\nin recent years. Last year the Secretary-General reported\r\nthat the situation in Jammu and Kashmir had further\r\ndeteriorated, and he highlighted the urgency of seeking a\r\npolitical solution through meaningful dialogue.\r\nIn this year’s report the Secretary-General has again\r\nexpressed the hope for an early and peaceful resolution of\r\ndifferences between India and Pakistan, including the\r\nJammu and Kashmir dispute. During the last three years,\r\nthe Secretary- General has reiterated his offer of good\r\noffices to facilitate the search for a lasting solution to the\r\nKashmir issue.\r\nOver the past several years, Pakistan has explored all\r\navenues for the resolution of this dispute. First and\r\nforemost, we have asked for a plebiscite under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations, which would be an international\r\ncommitment to the people of Kashmir and a binding\r\nobligation on India and Pakistan. Secondly, we have offered\r\nto hold meaningful and substantive talks on Kashmir, in\r\neither a bilateral or a multilateral framework. Thirdly, we\r\nhave accepted the United Nations Secretary-General’s offer\r\nto find a lasting solution to the problem. India has blatantly\r\nrejected all these overtures.\r\nIndia’s response to the political uprising in Kashmir\r\nhas been one of brutal and unabating repression. In the last\r\nsix years, it has deployed 700,000 troops to suppress the\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir. In those six years, it has\r\nkilled over 50,000 Kashmiris, imprisoned thousands of\r\npolitical activists and raped and dishonoured Kashmiri\r\nwomen. It has turned the whole of Kashmir into a\r\nmilitary concentration camp.\r\nLast year, when India realized that it could not crush\r\nthe will of the people of Kashmir through naked\r\naggression, it came up with two diabolical devices. First,\r\nit recruited and trained an army of renegades and\r\nmercenaries and unleashed them on unarmed Kashmiri\r\ncivilians. Second, it initiated a farcical electoral process\r\nto neutralize the political leadership of Kashmir. India has\r\nfailed on both counts. The renegades and mercenaries\r\nstand isolated, and the elections have been rejected by the\r\nKashmiri population.\r\nThe leader of the puppet regime installed in Jammu\r\nand Kashmir just two days ago said himself in an\r\ninterview on 7 October 1996:\r\n“Kashmir is not just elections. There is anti-India\r\nsentiment in the valley. It has been there since\r\n1947.”\r\nA pro-India leader in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Bim\r\nSingh, said:\r\n“the Assembly elections were manipulated through\r\nadministrative skill and fraud. In the 1987 elections,\r\nthe people voted and were robbed, while in the 1996\r\npolls the voters were robbed in absentia.”\r\nThe Telegraph, an Indian newspaper, wrote on\r\n17 September 1996:\r\n“Jawans [that is, Indian army personnel] choked the\r\npolling booths like bees around a honey-comb ...\r\nThe deeper you went into [Kashmir’s] wooded hill\r\ncountry, the more soldiers you found, stuffed into\r\nnature’s lovely crevices like hay in sacks.”\r\nAn Indian army soldier overseeing the elections was\r\nquoted as saying:\r\n“What kind of election is this? No polling agent, no\r\nelection agent, no polling list, no sign of parties or\r\ntheir candidates. We are having to do all their work.\r\nWe might well have contested [the elections]\r\nourselves.”\r\nImmediately after completing the farce of elections,\r\nIndia has now started targeting civilians. Ten to 20\r\nKashmiris are being killed by the Indian army every day.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nThe Indian occupation forces have declared their intention\r\nto continue their orgy of killing in Kashmir. Today\r\nKashmir’s genuine political leaders in Indian-held Kashmir\r\nare in jail.\r\nThe Jammu and Kashmir dispute is a critical threat to\r\npeace and security in a critically important region of the\r\nworld. The tensions generated there threaten both regional\r\nand international peace and security. That is why we\r\nconsider it absolutely vital that the United Nations should\r\nintercede to promote a just and peaceful solution to this\r\ndispute.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the search\r\nfor a political solution to the issue of Jammu and Kashmir\r\nthrough meaningful dialogue “is a matter of urgency”.\r\n(A/51/1, para. 806)\r\nThe main stumbling block to this dialogue is India’s\r\nobduracy. The moment any round of negotiation starts,\r\nIndia takes a historically incorrect and legally invalid stance\r\nthat Jammu and Kashmir is a part of India. There is a\r\nvirtual stalemate in Indo-Pakistan dialogue. Therefore, there\r\nis a need for the United Nations Secretary-General’s\r\nintercession to initiate his mediatory efforts.\r\nAs a first step, we propose that the Secretary-General\r\nconsider appointing a special representative who could\r\ncollect correct information about the situation in Jammu and\r\nKashmir and facilitate the process for a meaningful\r\ndialogue with a view to a lasting solution to the Kashmir\r\nissue.\r\nThe United Nations is passing through a critical phase\r\nof its history. Many feel that the Organization has lost its\r\nsense of direction and has not been able to come to terms\r\nwith some of its inherent weaknesses which were swept\r\nunder the carpet for far too long by the cold war. Many of\r\nthe issues emanating from these weaknesses were brought\r\nback squarely onto the table during the course of\r\ndeliberations in the high-level working groups and other\r\nmeetings earlier this year.\r\nUnfortunately, no solutions have yet been found for\r\nany of the major problems. The absence of the necessary\r\npolitical will on the part of many major actors, who appear\r\nunwilling to adjust to the need for fundamental\r\nreorganization, is responsible for the deep turmoil in which\r\nwe find ourselves.\r\nThe responsibility is ours, here in the General\r\nAssembly, to break this deadlock. The only question that\r\nwe are facing is whether we have the vision and the\r\npolitical commitment to depart from an Alice-in-\r\nWonderland approach of business-as-usual in order to\r\ntackle the real problems of a real world.\r\nMr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): Allow me first of all\r\nto express my delegation’s satisfaction with the manner in\r\nwhich Ambassador Razali has steered the work of the\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly since its\r\nopening. We look forward to his able stewardship in the\r\ndemanding months ahead. We also wish to express our\r\ndeep gratitude to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and revealing report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/51/1) which is before us today. My\r\ndelegation fully associates itself with the statement made\r\nby Colombia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWhile we have called for reform and restructuring of\r\nthe Organization in order to make it more effective,\r\ndemocratic, transparent and responsive to the needs of\r\nMember States, that reform should not be construed as a\r\nmere downsizing exercise, for that could result in a\r\nweakened and ineffective Organization. Reform of the\r\nSecretariat should not be approached merely as a cost-\r\ncutting exercise without due consideration to programme\r\ndelivery. The principal objective should be to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Organization. Cost-cutting per se does\r\nnot guarantee the attainment of that objective.\r\nTaking into account the changes that are taking place\r\nin our “global village”, it is imperative that we enhance\r\nand strengthen the multinational system so that our\r\nOrganization can respond effectively to the growing needs\r\nof the international community. In this connection, the\r\nSecretary-General rightly observes that change in the\r\nOrganization\r\n“should be perceived not as an imposition, not as\r\ncompromising the objectives of the Charter, but as\r\nadapting structures and methods to the new global\r\nenvironment that the Organization has helped to\r\nbring about.” (A/51/1, para. 6)\r\nWhile we agree that there are three main levels of\r\ninstitutional reform, it is clear that the mandate to reform\r\nand the programme of work of the Secretariat are the\r\nprerogative of Member States, through the General\r\nAssembly. The Secretariat, however, is responsible for the\r\nproper implementation of that mandate. The Secretariat\r\nshould not attempt to find ways of circumventing\r\ndecisions of the intergovernmental machinery. Any\r\nattempt to pursue the reform and restructuring of the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nOrganization in haste, without the authority and support of\r\nthe legislative authority, runs the risk of transforming the\r\nUnited Nations into an Organization that serves the interests\r\nof the few.\r\nA fortnight ago the Foreign Minister of the Republic\r\nof Zimbabwe stated in this Assembly that our primary\r\nobjective in reform should be to reaffirm the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the decision-making body of the\r\nentire United Nations system. Any process of restructuring\r\nand revitalization or strengthening should necessarily\r\nredress the erosion of the accountability to the General\r\nAssembly of the principal and subsidiary organs, and the\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations.\r\nThe continued existence of the open-ended working\r\ngroups of the General Assembly, which are at various\r\nstages of their work, is testimony to the legislative body’s\r\ncommitment to reform and revitalize our Organization. The\r\nforty-ninth session assigned the task of restructuring the\r\nSecretariat and the General Assembly to the Open-ended\r\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations System. That Group, which presented its\r\nfirst report to the fiftieth session, is charged both with a\r\nthorough review of the work of the various entities and\r\nwith determining future trends and the role of the\r\nOrganization. In our view, attempts to implement reforms\r\nin a selective manner will result in undermining the role of\r\nthat Working Group as well as the credibility of the\r\nGeneral Assembly itself. It would be prudent to wait for the\r\ndecisions of this and other working groups before\r\nimplementing any reforms.\r\nZimbabwe is fully aware of the financial crisis this\r\nOrganization is facing, mainly because of the failure of\r\ncertain Member States to pay their assessed contributions in\r\nfull, on time and without conditions. The failure to meet\r\nfinancial obligations and attempts to reform the\r\nOrganization by circumventing the General Assembly serve\r\nto further paralyse the Organization and erode the principle\r\nof representativity.\r\nDuring the fifty-first session, the Informal Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on An Agenda for Peace is expected to\r\ncontinue its work on two remaining sub-items: preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking; and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding. We believe that the General Assembly holds the\r\nkey role to play in post-conflict peace-building, since this\r\nis a reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction phase.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposals on preventive diplomacy\r\ncontained in the Supplement to “An Agenda for Peace”\r\ndeserve our support insofar as they seek to prevent and to\r\ncontain conflicts between States. We would, however, like\r\nto emphasize that the twin principles of request and\r\nconsent should always be respected.\r\nWe are perturbed that in paragraph 652 of his report,\r\nthe Secretary-General seeks to change the term\r\n“preventive diplomacy” to “preventive action” while the\r\nGeneral Assembly is still grappling with the definition of\r\npreventive diplomacy. These new and undefined\r\nterminologies, including “peace operations”, might throw\r\nthe entire process into confusion. While we commend the\r\nUnited Nations for its humanitarian activities in areas of\r\nconflict such as Somalia, Liberia and Angola,\r\nhumanitarian interventions should be linked to\r\ndevelopment in order to give the people affected a more\r\npredictable and sustained source of livelihood.\r\nWe note that issues pertaining to development do not\r\nreceive the same priority. But when they do, they are\r\nlinked to conflict resolution. It will be recalled that the\r\ndeveloping countries insisted in 1992, after the Secretary-\r\nGeneral had published his report “An Agenda for Peace”\r\nthat there should be an Agenda for Development because\r\nof our firm conviction that development is a precondition\r\nfor peace.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nAgenda for Development has the potential to provide an\r\nimportant blueprint for international development\r\ncooperation. However, given the attitudes so far shown in\r\nthe negotiations, my delegation has serious doubts that\r\nthat potential will be fully realized. Of particular concern\r\nto us are the attempts by some in our midst to renegotiate\r\nthe agreements and commitments already entered into at\r\nrecent major world conferences. The Agenda for\r\nDevelopment will be of no practical value to the\r\ndeveloping countries if it limits itself to an analysis of the\r\nworld economic outlook while failing to put forward\r\nspecific action-oriented measures for implementation in an\r\nintegrated and coordinated manner. In addition, this\r\nexercise should place the United Nations at the centre of\r\ninternational cooperation for development.\r\nMy delegation is satisfied with the outstanding work\r\nbeing carried out by United Nations programmes and\r\nfunds with meagre resources. Despite underfunded\r\nbudgets that are leaner every year, United Nations\r\ndevelopmental activities in the field have made a\r\ndifference in the lives of ordinary people in our cities and\r\nvillages. However, their performance is being seriously\r\nundermined by waning public support in the developed\r\ncountries.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nNumerous reforms have been proposed, or are already\r\nbeing implemented, to change the programming\r\narrangements, management style and funding mechanisms\r\nof United Nations programmes and funds. While we agree\r\nthat there is a need to increase efficiency in the delivery of\r\nprogrammes, we also caution that reform should not be an\r\ninterminable, open-ended exercise. The corporate culture\r\nthat the United Nations programmes and funds have been\r\ntrying to instil and to promote can have only a marginal\r\neffect if innovation is pursued for its own sake. I say this\r\nbecause for the last three years or so, we have been\r\noverwhelmed by a rapid succession of perhaps well-\r\nintentioned, but ill-defined and poorly understood proposals\r\nfor change. These include, among others, new successor\r\nprogramming arrangements, country strategy notes and\r\ncountry cooperation frameworks.\r\nEffective delivery of programmes should manifest\r\nitself in the improved lives of their beneficiaries. In order\r\nto profit from these reforms, the beneficiaries, who should\r\nalso be the active agents of change, should understand the\r\nfull import and value of the proposed reforms. If the\r\nrecipients understand change only when they experience a\r\nreduced level of funding for a country programme, as\r\nhappened to my country in the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA), this obviously sends confusing, if not\r\nwrong, signals. We believe that changes to criteria, to\r\nmethods of funding or to the longevity of programming\r\ncycles will not in themselves be a credible substitute for\r\nstrong political commitment to increasing resources for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the concluding chapter, and in paragraph 1140 in\r\nparticular, the Secretary-General alludes to a set of new\r\ndirections and ideas for future restructuring of the\r\nOrganization through the formation of clusters. These\r\ninclude peace and security, human rights, humanitarian\r\nassistance, economic and social analysis, and operational\r\nactivities for development. The report is not crystal-clear on\r\nthe content of, and linkages between, these clusters. The\r\ncriteria for selecting the clusters approach are not clear.\r\nWhile we recognize that the Secretary-General is the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the Organization, the concurrence\r\nof Member States is critical to the discharge of his\r\nmandate. We caution against any reform measures that seek\r\nto undo what has been accomplished in the recent past.\r\nRather, we should build on this.\r\nFor instance, the ninth session of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX)\r\nreached agreement on development. UNCTAD should\r\ntherefore retain its unique ability to offer a comprehensive\r\ntreatment of development under one roof. It must be given\r\nthe means to implement the programme of work to which\r\nall Member States committed themselves only four\r\nmonths ago.\r\nI wish to conclude by stating that my delegation\r\nbelieves that initiatives concerning simplification of the\r\nSecretariat structures, regrouping of its activities and\r\nassigning priorities to its programme of work are of a\r\nsubstantive nature and should not be considered merely\r\nmanagerial or administrative. Any modifications or\r\nchanges in that regard, therefore, should be left to the\r\nvarious Working Groups established by the General\r\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. It is expected that\r\nupon resumption of their activities, these bodies shall\r\nprovide appropriate advice to the General Assembly on\r\nrequired steps, the magnitude of changes and adequacy of\r\nresources for proper sustainability of the Organization and\r\nits enhanced operations. In this endeavour, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is expected to provide all necessary services and\r\ninformation, in particular as relates to the mandated tasks\r\nof these Working Groups, in order to assist them in their\r\ndeliberations and in the fulfilment of their mandate.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like to inform members that the representative of\r\nCosta Rica has asked to participate in the debate on this\r\nagenda item. Given that the list of speakers was closed at\r\nnoon today, may I take it that the General Assembly has\r\nno objection to that representative’s being added to the\r\nlist of speakers?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nshould like at the outset to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which touches on many issues that are the\r\nfocus of the Organization’s attention. Our views on these\r\nissues were expressed earlier this week in the statement\r\nmade by my country’s Foreign Minister before the\r\nAssembly.\r\nI will therefore limit myself in this connection to\r\nwhat was included in the section of the report entitled\r\n“The Humanitarian Imperative”, particularly that part\r\nrelated to Operation Lifeline Sudan, which stated that the\r\nGovernment of Sudan has restricted the delivery of relief\r\nsupplies. We would like to remind the Assembly that the\r\nGovernment of Sudan, of its own initiative, declared its\r\nwillingness to cooperate with the international community\r\nto relieve the suffering of those affected by the war that\r\nwas kindled by the rebel movement in the southern part\r\nof Sudan. To alleviate suffering and mitigate the effects\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nof war, we initiated Operation Lifeline Sudan so that the\r\ninternational community could channel its actions through\r\nthe United Nations. How could the Government of Sudan\r\nbe restricting the delivery of relief supplies, when it\r\ninitiated the whole process?\r\nSeven years have passed since the establishment of\r\nthis operation, which has become a model for relief-supply\r\ndistribution operations and for international cooperation and\r\nharmonization of national efforts in the service of\r\nhumanitarian objectives.\r\nOperation Lifeline Sudan depends on the element of\r\ntrust. Our trust in the impartiality, efficiency and\r\ntransparency of the United Nations led us to authorize it to\r\ncoordinate the work of the Operation. Although we consider\r\nit a success, the Operation faces certain difficulties. Some\r\nof the international organizations participating in the\r\nOperation complain that their access to the affected\r\npopulation is restricted. In addition, the Government of\r\nSudan believes that it is not participating sufficiently in the\r\nOperation.\r\nThe General Assembly discussed this issue last year\r\nand included a paragraph in its resolution on humanitarian\r\naid to Sudan that provides for full participation by the\r\nGovernment of Sudan in Operation Lifeline Sudan. The\r\nimplementation of that resolution, by ensuring full\r\nparticipation by the Government of Sudan, will promote\r\ntrust among the participants in the Operation, strengthening\r\nits prospects for success. It would also solve the problem of\r\nproviding access by the parties to the Operation to the\r\naffected population.\r\nThe Government of Sudan reiterates its determination\r\nto assist all peoples affected by war, in any part of the\r\nworld, including those besieged in areas of rebellion.\r\nMy country has witnessed positive political\r\ndevelopments on a large scale this past year, which have\r\nled to progress on the path to peace. Key rebel factions\r\nhave chosen peace and rejected war. Efforts in this\r\ndirection continue to be deployed, and we hope that other\r\nfactions also will choose peace. Therefore, the problem of\r\nrelief in Sudan does not constitute a severe emergency.\r\nPeace has created a great deal of stability and security,\r\nwhich has made relief-supply distribution easier and\r\ncheaper. Peace has also emphasized the need for the return\r\nof the displaced and for the rehabilitation and rebuilding of\r\nthe areas destroyed by war. This will require the\r\nparticipation of the international community, and we urge\r\nit to respond to the United Nations call concerning\r\nOperation Lifeline Sudan for 1996.\r\nThe rebel movement is fully responsible for the\r\nobstacles still impeding the delivery of relief supplies,\r\nsuch as the kidnapping of relief workers, destabilization,\r\nmanipulation, the plundering of supplies, and attacks\r\nagainst innocent civilians in their camps. The most recent\r\nof these events was the detention of relief workers three\r\nweeks ago. All of these practices were overlooked in the\r\nreport, which focuses on alleged government measures\r\nthat restrict the delivery of relief supplies. This position\r\nprejudices the principles of transparency and impartiality\r\nupon which the work of the Organization is based.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize the\r\nwillingness of the Government of Sudan fully to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations and all parties\r\nconcerned to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies to all\r\ncitizens in need. I reiterate that Sudan, which initiated\r\nOperation Lifeline Sudan in an unprecedented undertaking\r\nand a model of commitment to human rights, especially\r\nin circumstances of war — cannot be perceived as\r\nimpeding this Operation. I emphasize that the Sudan will\r\ncontinue efforts to establish peace in the country so there\r\nwill be no need for relief.\r\nMr. Hamdoon (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/51/1). The report outlines\r\nclearly the challenges and opportunities that face the\r\nUnited Nations in an increasingly complex world. The\r\nreport summarizes the important measures taken in many\r\nareas over the past year in order to reform the\r\nOrganization, strengthen its role and enhance its\r\nperformance, so that it will be capable of responding\r\neffectively to these challenges, utilizing these\r\nopportunities and achieving the goals enshrined in the\r\nCharter.\r\nWhile we commend the Secretary-General and the\r\nSecretariat staff for their dedicated efforts to attain that\r\ncherished goal, we reaffirm our conviction that the\r\nSecretary-General’s tireless efforts will not lead to the\r\ndesired reform of this world Organization unless all\r\nMember States work together towards that end. How, for\r\ninstance, can we achieve reform of the Security Council\r\nwhen some influential Powers insist on keeping the\r\nCouncil a club for the wealthy, refusing to recognize the\r\nintellectual, political, economic and social transformations\r\nthat have taken place in the world and that must be\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nreflected in the composition and methods of work of the\r\nCouncil? How can the financial situation of the United\r\nNations be reformed when the Organization is the hostage\r\nof one major Power, which refuses to fulfil its financial\r\nobligations towards the Organization? How can we\r\nrevitalize the role of the United Nations in the economic\r\nand social spheres when the countries of the North remain\r\nreluctant to give the countries of the South the opportunity\r\nthat they deserve in building an international economic\r\norder that will ensure sustainable development and equitable\r\ndevelopment opportunities?\r\nThese questions and many others make it abundantly\r\nclear that the core of reform is the political will of Member\r\nStates to prepare the United Nations to enter the next\r\ncentury as a true representative of the hopes and aspirations\r\nof all peoples.\r\nIn the chapter entitled “Preventing, controlling and\r\nresolving conflict”, there is a subsection entitled, “Iraq-\r\nKuwait”. That section begins by stating that the\r\n“easing or lifting [of sanctions] is blocked by Iraq’s\r\ncontinuing failure to comply with a number of\r\nobligations in the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions.” (A/51/1, para. 807)\r\nMy remarks will focus primarily on this quote, because the\r\nuse of the phrase “Iraq’s failure to comply” is not accurate.\r\nThus, all subsequent conclusions based on that idea are not\r\ncorrect either.\r\nI should like to elaborate. It has become common\r\nknowledge that the sanctions resolutions contain vague and\r\nunclear demands and leave to the implementing Power the\r\nfreedom to interpret what is required, without defining a\r\ntimetable or technical modalities for their implementation.\r\nLet me cite two examples. In regard to the question of\r\nprisoners and missing persons, Iraq has fully and sincerely\r\nfulfilled its obligations. Since 1991, it has repatriated more\r\nthan 6,500 prisoners, detainees and missing persons. Iraq\r\ncontinues to cooperate with the International Committee of\r\nthe Red Cross (ICRC) in the search for other missing\r\npersons; those who were found have been repatriated. Iraq\r\ncontinues to cooperate with the ICRC in order to resolve\r\nthis humanitarian issue.\r\nIs it admissible then to use the phrase “failure to\r\ncomply” to describe Iraq’s attitude and behaviour regarding\r\nthis issue? Everyone recognizes that the search for missing\r\npersons, in the aftermath of a war that saw the use of\r\nbombs more than eight times as destructive as the\r\nHiroshima bomb, will require many long years and\r\nperhaps decades. The Americans know this firsthand,\r\nsince they continue to search to no avail for some of their\r\nmissing soldiers from the Viet Nam war.\r\nIs it admissible that 4,500 Iraqi infants die monthly\r\nbecause of the lack of food and medicine, as was stated\r\nby a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)\r\nrepresentative a few days ago? Is it admissible to allow\r\nhealth and nutritional conditions in Iraq to deteriorate to\r\nthe point where an estimated 4 million people — the\r\nmajority of them children under five — are in danger of\r\nsevere physical and mental damage as a result of\r\nmalnutrition, as indicated in paragraph 821 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report? And all that because there are\r\n600 missing persons who have not yet been found. Is it\r\nadmissible to starve, even kill children in order to bring\r\npressure to bear on the Iraqi Government in an area in\r\nwhich Iraq is cooperating?\r\nWith regard to the question of the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, which is covered in detail\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, the use of the phrase\r\n“failure to comply” to describe Iraq’s conduct is wrong\r\nand unjust. Iraq has been cooperating with the United\r\nNations Special Commission and the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) since they began their work in\r\nMarch 1991 to achieve the goals set out in section C of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991). The semi-annual\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency, dated\r\n7 October 1996 and submitted to the Security Council,\r\nstates in paragraph 29,\r\n“All quantities of special nuclear material\r\n(highly enriched uranium or plutonium) found in\r\nIraq have been removed, and the industrial\r\ninfrastructure which Iraq had set up to produce and\r\nweaponize special nuclear material has been\r\ndestroyed.” (S/1996/833, para. 29)\r\nParagraph 28 of the same report states that:\r\n“In the period since the last report to the Council,\r\nthe IAEA has not seen instances of activities, or the\r\npresence, in Iraq, of equipment or materials\r\nproscribed by those resolutions.”\r\nand that:\r\n“The IAEA continues with the rigorous\r\nimplementation of its plan for the monitoring and\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nverification of Iraq’s compliance with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions”.\r\nIn the same paragraph, the report speaks to Iraq’s\r\ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency:\r\n“The Iraqi counterpart has continued to cooperate with\r\nthe IAEA in a productive way.”\r\nIs it reasonable then, to speak of Iraq’s failure to\r\ncomply, and is it admissible for marginal details and old\r\ndocuments to serve as pretexts for claiming that Iraq has\r\nfailed to comply with its obligations, while ignoring its\r\ncooperation over a period of more than five years? During\r\nthat time, the essential requirements of Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991) have been implemented. Iraq has\r\nturned millions of documents over to the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission; the report of the Secretary-General\r\nconfirms in paragraph 810 that more than 1 million pages\r\nof documents were handed over in August 1995. Yet the\r\nSpecial Commission continues to search for more\r\ndocuments. This situation raises legal and moral issues\r\nregarding the extent of requirements under Security Council\r\nresolutions, especially as these resolutions link the\r\nimplementation of their provisions to the lifting or easing\r\nof the comprehensive sanctions regime imposed on Iraq,\r\nwhich forbids the import of even medicine and food.\r\nOn 10 July 1996 the General Assembly ad hoc\r\nworking group on sanctions adopted a paper containing\r\nsome basic principles that must be considered when\r\nimposing, and during the imposition of, sanctions. That\r\npaper emphasized that sanctions should fully accord with\r\nthe provisions of the Charter; that they should have clear\r\nobjectives; that there should be precise conditions for their\r\nlifting; and that they should not cause unnecessary suffering\r\nfor the civilian population. The Security Council must set\r\na timetable for the sanctions regime, taking all those factors\r\ninto consideration.\r\nThe sanctions regime must also specify the steps to be\r\ntaken by the country concerned in order to ensure the lifting\r\nof the sanctions. Foodstuffs, medicine and medical supplies,\r\nas well as basic medical, agricultural and educational\r\nequipment, must be exempted from the sanctions. The\r\nfollowing question naturally comes to mind: Does the\r\nsanctions regime imposed on Iraq accord with these\r\nprinciples? I leave the answer to the discretion of fair-\r\nminded people.\r\nIn closing, I wish to emphasize that the sanctions\r\nregime imposed on Iraq is not only tantamount to an act of\r\ngenocide against an entire people, but is also a crime in\r\nthat it goes against the principles and values upon which\r\nthe United Nations was founded.\r\nMr. Kim (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea):\r\nI should like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his comprehensive report (A/51/1). I\r\nshould also like to thank him for his attention to the\r\nKorean question. As the report states, last year my\r\ncountry was hit by the heaviest floods in 100 years, and\r\nconsecutive natural disasters over a period of several\r\nyears have created temporary food problems. Now our\r\npeople, firmly united around the great leader Comrade\r\nKim Jong Il, are waging a nationwide campaign to repair\r\nthe damage, resettle the victims, and overcome all the\r\ndifficulties. I should like to take this opportunity to extend\r\nour gratitude to those countries and international agencies,\r\nincluding the United Nations, that provided sincere\r\nhumanitarian assistance to our people.\r\nThe Korean question is one of the most important\r\nmatters of which the United Nations remains seized. The\r\nfundamental aspect of the Korean question is the\r\ntermination of foreign intervention and the reunification\r\nof the country by peaceful means. The United Nations, in\r\nits early days, intervened in Korea at the forceful demand\r\nof the Powers, and thus is one of the parties responsible\r\nfor the division of Korea and the agony of the Korean\r\npeople.\r\nAs is well known, the United Nations is still legally\r\nin a state of war with the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea. The existence of the United Nations Command\r\nin South Korea is not based on any United Nations\r\nresolution. The July 1950 Security Council resolution that\r\nis often referred to as a legal basis for this Command\r\ndoes not mention anything about organizing it. These\r\nhistorical facts show that the great Powers have abused\r\nthe United Nations when dealing with the Korean\r\nquestion. Therefore, it is essential that the Organization\r\ncorrect the past with regard to this question. We regret,\r\nhowever, that the Secretary-General’s report does not\r\ntouch on the substance of the Korean question, which can\r\nbe construed as meaning that the United Nations does not\r\nhave the will to correct hostile relations with the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, but does have\r\nthe will to maintain them.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report mentions the\r\ncontinued observance of the Armistice Agreement,\r\nconcluded in 1953.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nThe Korean Armistice Agreement of 1953 is only a\r\ntemporary measure to suspend military actions between\r\nbelligerent parties. It was expected that it would be\r\ntransformed into a peace agreement. The Armistice\r\nAgreement cannot now prevent any accidental incidents —\r\nnot to mention the reoccurrence of war — as it has become\r\na mere scrap of paper because of the unilateral abrogation\r\nby the United States of its essential provisions.\r\nIn these circumstances, in April 1994 the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea proposed to the United States\r\nthe establishment of a new peace mechanism which would\r\nreplace the outdated Armistice Agreement. In February\r\n1996 the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea again\r\nproposed to conclude an interim agreement as a minimal\r\ninstitutional mechanism to prevent armed conflicts and the\r\nrecurrence of war, taking into consideration the United\r\nStates policy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the status of their bilateral relations. However,\r\nup to now the United States has not responded to our\r\npeace-loving proposals.\r\nIf the United Nations is really concerned about the\r\nsituation on the Korean peninsula, it should correct\r\nbelligerent relations with the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea by dissolving the United Nations command,\r\nretrieving the United Nations flag from the United States\r\nArmy in South Korea and assisting in the establishment of\r\na new peace mechanism to replace the outdated Armistice\r\nmechanism, which is of no use for peace and security on\r\nthe Korean peninsula.\r\nIn this regard, we think the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should present measures and recommendations\r\nintended to correct the unsavoury past history of the United\r\nNations in Korea and to contribute to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of the Korean question.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): My delegation would like\r\nfirst of all to thank the Secretary-General for his very\r\ncomprehensive and forward-looking report on the work of\r\nour Organization. Its sheer volume, which increases\r\nannually, enables us to imagine how wide and varied the\r\nactivities of our Organization have been in the common\r\nservice of mankind. These activities vary from international\r\npeace and security to international economic cooperation;\r\nfrom humanitarian and relief activities to technical\r\nassistance, and from the promotion of human rights to the\r\nmonitoring, organization and certification of elections\r\nwithin Member States.\r\nMy delegation observed from the report that United\r\nNations activities in the fields of conflict prevention,\r\nconflict resolution, peacemaking, peacekeeping and\r\nhumanitarian activities — particularly emergency relief\r\nactivities — continue to engage most of our\r\nOrganization’s attention and have heavy resource\r\nimplications, to the detriment of development efforts. Of\r\ncourse, we would have loved the United Nations to focus\r\nmore of its attention on, and devote the bulk of its\r\nresources to, socio-economic activities aimed at poverty\r\nalleviation, but we are painfully aware that there can be\r\nno development without peace and no sustainable peace\r\nwithout development.\r\nThe linkage between the two justifies the attention\r\nthe General Assembly continues to devote to the\r\nSecretary-General’s “An Agenda for Peace” and to “An\r\nAgenda for Development”. We note the progress that has\r\nbeen achieved by the various General Assembly working\r\ngroups and urge the early completion of the exercise in\r\norder to produce agreements on the major, defining\r\nthemes.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping operations, we welcome\r\nthe new efforts in improved United Nations cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations, as envisaged under Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. However, in doing so\r\nwe wish to emphasize that the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security lies\r\nsquarely with the United Nations. Moreover, the\r\ninternational community should, in our view, give\r\nconcrete logistical and financial assistance to regional and\r\nsubregional bodies such as the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) for peacekeeping efforts\r\nin their respective areas.\r\nWe also welcome the observation in paragraphs 651\r\nand 652 of the Secretary-General’s report which identify\r\npreventive diplomacy and peacemaking as critical\r\nelements in preventing crises. In this connection, we note\r\nwith satisfaction the measures introduced by the\r\nSecretary-General to enhance the Organization’s capacity\r\nto discharge what he refers to as “preventive action”\r\nthrough early warning, quiet diplomacy and, in some\r\ncases, preventive deployment. The joint and coordinated\r\naction of the key departments in this area — namely the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs (DPA), the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs (DHA) — need to be further\r\nenhanced. We agree with the Secretary-General that\r\npreventive activities could help prevent human suffering\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nand serve as an alternative to costly politico-military\r\noperations to resolve conflicts after they have broken out.\r\nThe increasing globalization and interdependence of\r\nthe world economy mask one disturbing reality: the\r\ncontinued impoverishment of the large population of the\r\ncountries of the South. More integrated efforts will be\r\nclearly required of the United Nations system if the\r\nobjectives set out in “An Agenda for Development” are to\r\nbe achieved. It is imperative that we improve the system’s\r\nability to develop and to implement social and economic\r\ndevelopment programmes in a more coordinated and\r\ncoherent manner.\r\nWe also support the increasing efforts to enhance\r\ncoordination and collaboration between the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and United Nations bodies in order to work in\r\ncloser harmony for the mutual benefit of all, particularly the\r\nmajority, who are in developing countries. In this regard,\r\nwe look forward to an early conclusion of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly with regard to the elaboration of an\r\nAgenda for Development.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General demonstrates\r\nclearly the challenges and opportunities which now face the\r\nUnited Nations in an increasingly complex global\r\nenvironment. It also outlines the significant reform\r\nmeasures and staff rationalization which have been\r\nundertaken in many areas of the Secretariat by the\r\nSecretary-General over the past four and a half years in\r\norder to strengthen the role and functioning of the\r\nOrganization to respond effectively to the new challenges\r\nand opportunities at the dawn of a new millennium.\r\nUnfortunately, however, all the reform measures that\r\nhave been implemented will not produce the required\r\nresults as long as we continue to starve the United Nations\r\nof the requisite financial resources. As the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Nigeria remarked during the general\r\ndebate,\r\n“A vibrant and responsible United Nations\r\nrequires an assured financial base. The failure or\r\nunwillingness of Member States to pay their assessed\r\ncontributions as and when due is a dereliction of\r\nCharter obligations and a threat to the survival of the\r\nUnited Nations.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary Meetings, 21st\r\nmeeting, p. 13)\r\nIn this connection, we note the proposal of the\r\nSecretary-General in paragraph 187 of his report (A/51/1)\r\nconcerning the ceiling of the scale of assessments, and\r\nwish to stress that any review of the scale must take into\r\naccount the principles of capacity to pay and special\r\nresponsibility of any Member under the Charter.\r\nMy delegation believes that we should make clear\r\nthe difference between the imperative for any organization\r\nlike the United Nations constantly to devise ways and\r\nmeans to enhance its performance, its effectiveness and\r\nits efficiency in order to meet current challenges, and the\r\nrationalization that is induced by the deliberate refusal of\r\ncertain Members to pay their dues.\r\nReform is necessary but should not be used to\r\nundermine the capacity of the Organization to carry out\r\nits mandates. The present rationalization exercise has led\r\nto the cutting of some mandated programmes and\r\nservices, as well as the reduction of personnel devoted to\r\ndevelopmental activities, without much analysis or\r\nappreciation of their relevance to the lot of the poor.\r\nAfter all, if we were all to pay our outstanding\r\nobligations, the United Nations would not be experiencing\r\nany financial problems or, worse still, a crisis.\r\nThe crisis manifests itself in some unacceptable\r\nsituations such as arrears in reimbursement to troop-\r\ncontributing nations. As the Secretary-General himself\r\nobserved, it is absurd that our reward to countries,\r\nincluding some of the world’s poorest, that send their\r\nsons and daughters into harm’s way on behalf of the\r\ninternational community, is to impose an additional\r\nfinancial burden on them. Troop contributors are in effect\r\nfinancing the shortfalls that result when some Member\r\nStates fail to pay their assessed contributions on time and\r\nin full. Reforms will not cure this anomaly; only payment\r\nof assessed dues will.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): My delegation would like to express its full\r\nsupport for the statement made this morning by Colombia\r\non behalf of the non-aligned countries on the matter we\r\nare discussing today.\r\nWe welcome with satisfaction the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization. We\r\nthank him warmly for the report, just as we thank him for\r\nthe various initiatives he has taken to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization and to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Secretariat.\r\nAs a reflection of the various and wide-ranging\r\nactivities of the United Nations, this year’s document is\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nof very special importance because it gives a rather\r\nreassuring picture, on the basis of our many achievements\r\nand the reaffirmation of continued commitment to the goals\r\nof the United Nations by the world leaders who met here a\r\nyear ago. However, frustration is still felt by most countries\r\nof the world because of difficulties in meeting requirements\r\nof their own economic and social development.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General on the close\r\ncorrelation and interaction between development and peace.\r\nHowever, in such an important document as the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, it is important that development be\r\na goal in itself. That is to say, it constitutes a separate\r\nchapter as a requirement that must receive the priority\r\ninterest of the entire international community, as a right of\r\ncountries and peoples and as a basis for peace in the\r\nbroadest possible sense. Future action, both by the General\r\nAssembly and the Organization as a whole, should deal\r\nwith continuing and strengthening efforts to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of commitments made, in particular in the\r\nframework of the major United Nations conferences, to\r\nbring about progress in international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe important questions taken up by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report obviously include the question of the\r\nreform of the Organization. In this respect, we believe that\r\nthe deliberations within the working groups on the reform\r\nof the United Nations system and of the Security Council\r\nshould be given priority attention by Member States during\r\nthis session so as to speed up discussion and see to it that\r\nthe goals sought are met. These include the strengthening\r\nof the role of the General Assembly as a universal body\r\nsymbolizing the sovereign equality of States, in accordance\r\nwith the Charter, the democratization of the Security\r\nCouncil and the enhancement of the transparency of its\r\nactivities, in accordance with the new geopolitical realities\r\nof the world. If we are expeditiously to complete\r\nnegotiations on reforming the Council and arrive at\r\nconsensus, there needs to be a spirit of compromise on the\r\npart of the various States and groups of States concerned.\r\nThe ongoing reform of the Secretariat should also be\r\ncontinued in order to enhance the efficiency of the\r\nadministrative structure of the Organization and to further\r\nrationalize its functioning. However, reform of the\r\nSecretariat should encompass, inter alia, an equitable\r\ndistribution of high-level posts among nationals from the\r\nvarious regions of the world. It goes without saying that our\r\nOrganization cannot meet its responsibilities appropriately\r\nand that the global reform we are discussing cannot be\r\nfollowed through to the end and achieve the desired results\r\nif the financial crisis the Organization has been\r\nexperiencing for several years continues. Once again, we\r\naffirm here the urgent need to put an end to this state of\r\naffairs. Member States are duty-bound to fulfil their\r\nfinancial obligations to the United Nations by paying their\r\nbudgetary contributions on time and in full.\r\nThe vast and multidimensional spectrum of activities,\r\nas well as the other questions taken up by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, cannot be covered in such a brief\r\nand general debate. We therefore think it is highly\r\ndesirable that each year a summary, a short version of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, be published and\r\nhighlight the main issues on the agenda of the United\r\nNations and the major problems it has to face.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I\r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and informative report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, in which many important national, political,\r\neconomic and social issues have been discussed and\r\nanalysed. In the light of the analysis of the activities and\r\nreform efforts of the Organization in the past year, the\r\nSecretary-General’s vision of the future of the\r\nOrganization is of a United Nations that works.\r\nBecause of the importance of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General in mapping out the future of the\r\nOrganization, we believe it deserves serious and careful\r\nconsideration by Member States. We welcome this\r\nopportunity to make some preliminary observations. Of\r\ncourse, the report requires more in-depth consideration in\r\na more appropriate venue. The Open-ended High-level\r\nWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United\r\nNations System dealt with some topics of the report\r\nduring the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation fully endorses the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Colombia on behalf of the\r\nnon-aligned countries. At the same time, I would like to\r\nmake the following preliminary observations of a general\r\nnature to highlight my delegation’s understanding of the\r\npriorities of the United Nations agenda, the division of\r\nresponsibility and the manner and assessment of reform\r\nand of the implementation of General Assembly\r\nmandates.\r\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out in his report,\r\nthe recent major international conferences on\r\ndevelopment, as well as the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, provided the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nopportunity for the international community to commit itself\r\nto give the twenty-first century\r\n“a United Nations equipped, financed and structured\r\nto serve its peoples” (A/51/1, p. iii)\r\nin whose name it was established. In this respect, we agree\r\nwith him that the reform process is neither an imposition,\r\nnor a compromise over the objectives of the Charter.\r\nHowever, these endeavours can bear fruit if the crucial need\r\nfor and legitimate expectation of the developing world to\r\nplace the issue of development, both as a prerequisite for\r\npeace and stability and as a right, at the forefront of the\r\nagenda of the United Nations is fully taken into account.\r\nWe share the view of the Secretary-General that:\r\n“Development and democratization can themselves be\r\nthe most effective forms of conflict prevention.” (ibid.,\r\npara. 1133)\r\nHowever, issues related to development have received\r\nlesser priority and, where they are addressed in the report,\r\nit is in the narrow confine of conflict prevention.\r\nFurthermore, we share the concern expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General over the fact that the United Nations is:\r\n“facing a sharp decline in international development\r\nassistance” (ibid., para. 1134)\r\nI would like to emphasize that the success of the reform\r\nefforts depends, to a great extent, on the degree to which\r\ndeveloped countries fulfil their commitments in terms of the\r\nprovision of new and additional financial resources.\r\nDisarmament has traditionally been at the top of the\r\nagenda of the United Nations. However, there has been a\r\ndiscernable trend in the Organization in recent years to\r\nde-emphasize the role of disarmament, particularly at the\r\nmacro level, in strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity. The place accorded to the issue of disarmament in\r\nthe contents of the report of the Secretary- General and the\r\nminor treatment of macro-disarmament in the main body of\r\nthe report are among the indications of this trend. In\r\naddition, major developments in the field of disarmament\r\nhave not been adequately addressed in the report before us.\r\nThey include: the recent historic advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on the illegality of nuclear\r\nweapons; the continuing qualitative improvement of nuclear\r\nweapons; the threatening revision of the nuclear policy of\r\nnuclear-weapon States; the refusal of the biggest possessors\r\nof chemical weapons to ratify the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\r\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,\r\nthe race among the largest producers of conventional\r\nweapons to transfer such weapons to already destabilized\r\nregions of the world, such as the Middle East; and the\r\nproliferation of secret, discriminatory and non-negotiated\r\narrangements under the pretext of non-proliferation.\r\nThe issues raised in the international debate over\r\npreventive diplomacy, peacekeeping, peacemaking and\r\npost-conflict peace-building are stimulating and\r\nchallenging. In my delegation’s view, these activities\r\nshould be devised, developed, and undertaken in\r\naccordance with the objectives and principles of the\r\nCharter. Definitions, objectives, terms of reference and\r\nmeans of implementation of such activities should be\r\nclearly elaborated by Member States so as to uphold the\r\ncardinal principles of the sovereign equality of States,\r\nrespect for the political independence of States,\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States, and\r\ninviolability of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nStates.\r\nPeacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building are\r\ntwo kinds of United Nations operations with the common\r\ngoal of maintaining peace and security in the world.\r\nHowever, their functions are different and, in the view of\r\nmy delegation, the General Assembly should have the key\r\nrole in the post-conflict peace-building activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in close cooperation with other relevant\r\norgans of the United Nations system.\r\nThe Secretary-General distinguishes three different\r\ntypes of reform: intergovernmental, organizational and\r\nmanagerial. As for the division of responsibility on\r\norganizational reform, the report states that\r\n“it is a joint responsibility of the Secretary-General\r\nand the Member States” (ibid., para. 11)\r\nwhile the managerial reform is presented as being purely\r\nwithin the discretion of the Secretary-General.\r\nIt should be noted that not all managerial reforms\r\nare purely of an non-contentious, administrative nature,\r\nfalling within the purview of the Secretary-General. Any\r\nmajor reform will of necessity have a direct implication\r\nfor the implementation of the work programme mandated\r\nby the governing bodies. While the Secretary-General is\r\nthe chief administrative officer, he should, in the process\r\nof implementation of General Assembly resolutions and\r\ndecisions, keep the General Assembly informed of any\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nchanges and keep the channel of communication and\r\nconsultation open.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General should provide an\r\nanalysis of the effects of restructuring, its programme\r\nimplications, and shifts in the resources approved by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOne of the measures taken in balancing the budget as\r\npresented by the Secretary-General is a 12 per cent\r\nreduction in posts (in comparison with 10 years ago). Even\r\naccepting efficiency increases, it is hard to imagine how the\r\nincreased responsibilities entrusted to the Organization by\r\nMember States could be carried out with such a reduced\r\nstaff base. This drastic reduction is bound to have a\r\nnegative impact on programme delivery, as is evidenced by\r\nvarious paragraphs, such as paragraphs 25 and 56, which\r\nrefer to the lack of resources in support of development\r\nissues.\r\nThe report briefly refers to a set of new directions and\r\nideas for future restructuring of the Organization in its\r\nconcluding chapter, and proposes the formation of a small\r\nnumber of clusters involving all entities of the\r\nOrganization. In this context, we believe that our efforts\r\nshould focus on identifying the roots and causes of the\r\nmaladies of several funds and programmes and trying to\r\nremedy this malaise in order to enable them to implement\r\ntheir mandates in full rather than to cluster and undermine\r\nthem. The accumulated experience and expertise of these\r\nagencies, bodies, funds, programmes and regional\r\ncommissions are valid instruments for enhancing\r\ninternational cooperation for development — an objective\r\nthat was impossible to achieve in the era of the cold war.\r\nIn the final analysis, we continue to maintain that the\r\nproposed reform concerning clustering should not be\r\ndevised, developed, and carried out in a manner that\r\nvirtually leads to dismantling or undermining the funds and\r\nprogrammes with mandates in development.\r\nWe would like to be able to share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view that last year’s reform efforts and activities\r\nrepresent a vision for a “United Nations that works”\r\n(A/51/1, para. 1144). We consider the Secretary-General’s\r\nview of the future of the United Nations to be\r\nconstructive — one that could serve the growth and\r\ncentrality of the United Nations in the post-cold war era.\r\nHowever, the continued undue influence exercised by\r\ncertain Members not only on the Organization but also on\r\ninter-State relations, the diminished desire to join\r\nmultilateral problem-solving efforts, and above all the use\r\nof power politics and unilateral measures to impose the\r\nself-serving narrow interests of one or a small group of\r\nnations over others can overshadow the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s vision of a “United Nations that works”.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): I wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the impressive documentation he has provided\r\nin his report on the work of our Organization, and I wish\r\nto thank him especially for the political orientation of his\r\nintroductory remarks and some specific sections. More\r\nthan in previous years the report provides some basic\r\nguidelines for the Organization to follow. We welcome\r\nthis new approach.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report highlights various\r\nissues I wish to discuss, following the order in which they\r\nare presented in the report: first, the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system; second, development,\r\nhumanitarian action and human rights; and third, peace\r\nactions.\r\nOn the first point, coordinating a comprehensive\r\nstrategy and strengthening the United Nations system, I\r\nam pleased to recall that my country has made an\r\nongoing contribution to the activities of all five working\r\ngroups. Although their main goals were not achieved,\r\nsignificant steps forward were made in identifying the\r\nmost urgent problems. One of these is the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. My country is against any extension of\r\nthe status quo. The time has come to open the door and\r\nlet the future in. To this end, Italy has presented a\r\nproposal that, in the more than two and a half years since\r\nthe beginning of this exercise, has received public\r\nstatements of support or interest from 77 countries, some\r\nof whom see it as a fall-back position in the event that a\r\nconsensus cannot be reached on the other proposals\r\ntabled.\r\nThe report of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council (A/50/47)\r\nacknowledges that granting permanent seats to only two\r\ncountries is “unacceptable”. The report also informs us\r\nthat in the deliberations of the Working Group the\r\nproposal for new permanent seats received “both support\r\nand objections”. But instead “wide support” was received\r\nfor an increase in non-permanent seats in case of no\r\nagreement on the increase of other categories of\r\nmembership. Consequently, it seems to us that an increase\r\nin non-permanent seats is the most natural road to follow,\r\nand in fact this is the underlying principle of both the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement’s position and the Italian\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nproposal. As Foreign Minister Dini said in his address to\r\nthe General Assembly:\r\n“We are willing to discuss and adhere to a formula\r\nthat is not inconsistent with the fundamental principles\r\nthat govern our own proposal.” (A/51/PV.10, p. 5)\r\nAnd I do not need to recall here that these principles are\r\ndemocracy, equitable geographic representation,\r\ntransparency and efficiency.\r\nIn other words, we say “no” to new regimes of\r\nprivilege, and we say “yes” to the participation of all and\r\nthe exclusion of none. In our opinion, the general debate\r\nthat just ended yesterday has confirmed this trend, and we\r\nare encouraged by the degree of support expressed for our\r\nproposal. I repeat, we are for participation, and not\r\nmarginalization or exclusion. We are for openness and\r\ntransparency. Above all, we are for democracy and against\r\nelitism.\r\nThis approach applies not only to institutional reform\r\nbut also to procedures. Therefore we strongly believe that\r\nthe steps taken in the Security Council by Argentina, New\r\nZealand and the Czech Republic, and followed later on by\r\nItaly and others, toward improving the transparency of the\r\nCouncil should be continued, by making it not only regular\r\npractice but a requirement for the Security Council to hold\r\nconsultations with interested parties before decisions are\r\nmade, especially decisions that concern them directly.\r\nOther reforms are also urgently needed, especially to\r\nstreamline the work of this Assembly, reduce duplication\r\nand overlap, and place the Organization on a sounder\r\nfinancial footing. At the same time as we pay homage to\r\nwhat has already been done, let us not forget that there are\r\nbodies such as, for instance, the Trusteeship Council that no\r\nlonger have any reason to exist as they are now. Here I\r\nwish to reiterate my country’s position in favour of granting\r\nspecial consideration to the proposal submitted by Malta\r\naimed at strengthening the Trusteeship Council’s mandate\r\nby conferring upon it the function of guardian and trustee\r\nof the so-called “common heritage of mankind”, the wealth\r\nthat belongs to all.\r\nA similar spirit should also prevail in confronting the\r\nfinancial situation of the Organization. Italy has repeatedly\r\nexpressed its full support for the position defined and\r\nofficially presented by the European Union. We believe that\r\nconsiderable efforts have already been made to balance the\r\nbudget and to eliminate waste. To this end I wish to\r\ncommend specifically the excellent job done by the Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Administration and Management,\r\nMr. Joseph Connor, whose leadership has been invaluable\r\nin already achieving some ground-breaking results. In\r\ncommon with many others, however, we also believe that\r\nthe policy of budget cuts must never get in the way of the\r\nOrganization’s achieving its priority objectives: assuring\r\ninternational peace and security, promoting development,\r\nsupporting democracy, and safeguarding human rights.\r\nItaly continues to support with the same conviction\r\nthe position of the European Union regarding the need for\r\nall Member States to pay their assessments in full, on\r\ntime and without condition. It is also in favour of a\r\nreview of the scale of assessments based on capacity to\r\npay and a substantial reduction or elimination of the floor.\r\nThe second chapter of the Secretary-General’s report\r\ndeals with building the foundations of peace,\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian action and human rights. Italy\r\nhas been an enthusiastic supporter of an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment from the very beginning. In this regard, I\r\nwish to recall the participation in 1994 World Hearings of\r\nour expert in development issues, Mrs. Emma Bonino,\r\nwho is currently the Commissioner of the European\r\nCommunity Humanitarian Office. Italy believes that “An\r\nAgenda for Development” must constitute a key\r\ndocument to guide the future action, not only of our\r\nOrganization but also of our national Governments. The\r\nOpen-ended Working Group presided over by the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Benin and Sweden,\r\nAmbassadors Mongbé and Osvald, has undoubtedly made\r\nremarkable progress. Regrettably, the group was not able\r\nto conclude its negotiations by the end of the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, but we hope that the\r\nwork can be resumed and completed during the current\r\nsession and that an Agenda for Development will address\r\nthe dramatic and rapid changes taking place in the field\r\nof international cooperation, especially with the increase\r\nin globalization, liberalization and interdependence.\r\nStill in the framework of development, Italy\r\ncommends the “White Helmets” initiative launched by the\r\nenlightened President of Argentina, His Excellency\r\nMr. Carlos Menem, and their participation in United\r\nNations activities in the field of humanitarian relief. We\r\nhave supported this initiative in concrete terms by\r\nco-sponsoring a resolution and co-funding activities in the\r\nfield.\r\nItaly attaches the utmost importance to the United\r\nNations role in the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, which is based on\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nhistoric values and principles enshrined in the Charter. We\r\nconsider the World Conference on Human Rights held in\r\nVienna in 1993 a landmark event. At the following session\r\nof the General Assembly, it was decided to establish the\r\npost of United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights. Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso of Ecuador, who was\r\nappointed to carry out this task, is indeed doing an\r\nexcellent job in strengthening United Nations machinery in\r\nthis field.\r\nWith regard to the third chapter of the report that we\r\nare examining now, on preventing, controlling and resolving\r\nconflict, it is our firm conviction that the United Nations\r\ncannot impose peace by making war. In other words, the\r\nUnited Nations is ill-equipped to carry out peace-\r\nenforcement operations due to a lack of the proper\r\nvocation, structure and resources. Let us mandate peace\r\nenforcement to those who can do it — namely, properly\r\nequipped regional organizations or a coalition of States. But\r\nthis realization should not be taken as a signal for\r\ndisengagement. Indeed, as the Secretary-General’s report\r\nmakes clear, in the year under review, peacekeeping\r\noperations made up the bulk of the United Nations peace\r\noperations: 17 out of 33. Above all, we are glad to say that\r\nlast year, the United Nations focused more both on\r\npreventive diplomacy and on post-conflict peace-building,\r\nwith special regard for bringing speedy humanitarian relief\r\nand helping rebuild economies. We were also glad to see\r\nthe emphasis given to improving the rapid deployment of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. We welcome the\r\nprogress made in developing a rapidly deployable\r\nheadquarters module, as suggested by Canada, and we\r\nsupport the efforts to enhance preparedness for conflict\r\nprevention and peacekeeping in Africa, as in other parts of\r\nthe world, and in further developing the system of stand-by\r\narrangements. Friends of rapid reaction have been\r\nparticularly active in this regard, and I would like here to\r\nsingle out the contribution and the innovative thinking of\r\nBelgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and the\r\nUnited States.\r\nIn this context, I would like to underline that the need\r\nfor more efficient logistic support and rapid deployment of\r\npeacekeeping operations recognized in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report led Italy to make available, free of charge,\r\nthe first United Nations logistic base in Brindisi. We have\r\nsuggested a separate allocation in the peacekeeping budget\r\nfor the logistic bases, as advised by the special committee\r\non peacekeeping operations during the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Again, what we need here in this field\r\nis action, not mere words.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary year marked the end of one\r\nera and the beginning of a new one. As we embark on\r\nthis journey, I look forward to working under the\r\nleadership of our colleague Ambassador Razali Ismail,\r\nwhose deep knowledge of United Nations machinery,\r\npragmatism, diplomatic skill and well-known impartiality\r\nare a guarantee that the new chapter which is opening in\r\nUnited Nations history will be a most fruitful one.\r\nMrs. Incera (Costa Rica) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I\r\nwish to convey my congratulations to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on his election. We are certain that his\r\nknowledge and experience will contribute significantly to\r\nthe success of the work of this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China wishes to thank the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for\r\npresenting his report contained in document A/51/1 which\r\ncontains much valuable information on the activities of\r\nthe Organization and its Secretariat. I wish to take this\r\nopportunity only to point out for the record that, for the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, in the Fifth Committee,\r\nparagraph 94 of the report poses difficulties. Accordingly,\r\nwe wish to state that the Group of 77 and China does not\r\naccept the content of that paragraph and we request that\r\nthis be duly reflected in the record.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 October 1996\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have thus concluded the present stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 10.\r\nAnnouncement by the President\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe President: I should like to point out that,\r\naccording to our calculations and based on the number of\r\nspeakers who remain, we will have to continue the debate\r\non Monday. Without trying to limit the right to speak, I\r\nappeal for brevity. Perhaps we could limit speeches to 10\r\nminutes or less, as the Committees are doing. If we do\r\nnot, fewer people will be able to speak or we will have to\r\nspend more time on the subject being debated. I accept\r\nthat the subject is very important, but nevertheless I\r\nappeal for brevity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
