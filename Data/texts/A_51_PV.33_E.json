(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other\r\nelections\r\n(b) Election of twenty members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/51/269)\r\nThe President: In accordance with General Assembly\r\ndecision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the Assembly elects\r\nthe members of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination upon their nomination by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/51/269,\r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to fill the vacancies in the Committee that will\r\noccur as a result of the expiration on 31 December 1996 of\r\nthe terms of office of Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Cameroon,\r\nCanada, Comoros, the Congo, Cuba, Germany, India,\r\nIndonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Netherlands,\r\nNorway, Pakistan, Romania, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nUkraine and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 1997, the following States will still be members\r\nof the Committee: the Bahamas, Benin, China, Egypt,\r\nFrance, Ghana, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the\r\nRussian Federation, Togo, the United States of America,\r\nUruguay and Zaire.\r\nTherefore, those 14 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nThe following States have been nominated by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council: four African States for four\r\nvacancies — Cameroon, Congo, Nigeria, Zimbabwe; four\r\nAsian States for four vacancies — Indonesia, Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Pakistan, Thailand; four Eastern\r\nEuropean States for three vacancies — Bulgaria, Poland,\r\nRomania, Ukraine; four Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates for four vacancies — Argentina, Brazil, Nicaragua,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago; four Western European and other\r\nStates for five vacancies — Austria, Germany,\r\nNetherlands, United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nMr. Verweij (Netherlands): I have to inform the\r\nAssembly formally that my Government has decided to\r\nwithdraw the Netherlands candidature for the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination.\r\nThe President: The number of States nominated\r\nfrom among the African States, the Asian States, the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States and the Western\r\nEuropean and other States is equal to or does not exceed\r\nthe number of seats to be filled in each of those regions.\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 14 October 1996\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nall elections shall be held by secret ballot. However, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, the\r\nAssembly may, in elections to subsidiary organs, dispense\r\nwith secret balloting when the number of candidates\r\ncorresponds to the number of seats to be filled.\r\nTaking into account the statement just made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Netherlands, may I take it that the\r\nAssembly wishes to declare those States nominated by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council from among the African\r\nStates, the Asian States, the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates and the Western European and other States —\r\nArgentina, Austria, Brazil, Cameroon, the Congo, Germany,\r\nIndonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nicaragua, Nigeria,\r\nPakistan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and\r\nZimbabwe — elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination for a three-year term\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1997?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have\r\nbeen elected members of the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination.\r\nWith regard to the three seats to be filled from among\r\nthe Eastern European States, the number of candidates\r\nnominated exceeds the number of vacancies allocated to\r\nthis region. Therefore, the Assembly will now proceed to a\r\nvote by secret ballot to elect three members from the\r\nEastern European States.\r\nIn accordance with the rules of procedure, the required\r\nnumber of candidates that receives the largest number of\r\nvotes and not less than the majority will be declared\r\nelected.\r\nIn case of a tie vote for the last seat, there will be a\r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have\r\nobtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that\r\nprocedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Ballot papers for the Eastern European\r\nStates will now be distributed.\r\nThe voting process has begun.\r\nOnly the following four States nominated by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council are eligible: Bulgaria,\r\nPoland, Romania and Ukraine. I should like to stress that\r\nonly the names of three of those States should be written\r\non the ballot paper.\r\nI request representatives to use only the ballot papers\r\nthat are being distributed and to write the names of the\r\nthree States for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers\r\ncontaining more than three names will be declared\r\ninvalid. Names of ineligible States appearing on a ballot\r\npaper shall not be counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Miss Montaño-\r\nDuran (Bolivia), Miss Miller (Malta) and Mr. Seaton\r\n(South Africa) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.05 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 160\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 160\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of Members voting: 160\r\nRequired majority: 81\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nPoland 131\r\nRomania 127\r\nUkraine 125\r\nBulgaria 89\r\nThe following States, having obtained the required\r\nmajority and the largest number of votes, were\r\nelected members of the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination for a three-year term beginning on\r\n1 January 1997: Poland, Romania and Ukraine.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have\r\njust been elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination, and I thank the tellers for\r\ntheir assistance in the election.\r\nThe following 18 States have thus been elected\r\nmembers of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination for a three-year term beginning on l January\r\n1997: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cameroon, Congo,\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 14 October 1996\r\nGermany, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nNicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Thailand,\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, and Zimbabwe.\r\nRegarding the two remaining vacancies from among\r\nthe Western European and other States, the General\r\nAssembly will be in a position to act on them upon the\r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council of two\r\nMember States from that region.\r\nI therefore propose that the Assembly keep this\r\nsub-item on the agenda of the fifty-first session. May I take\r\nit that the Assembly agrees to that proposal?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this stage of\r\nour consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 17.\r\nAgenda item 98\r\nOperational activities for development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/256)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\nconsider the report of the Secretary-General on the progress\r\nat mid-decade on the implementation of General Assembly\r\nresolution 45/217 on the World Summit for Children, which\r\nhas been issued as document A/51/256.\r\nI call on the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: The World Summit for\r\nChildren was held six years ago in this building. Six\r\nmember States — Canada, Egypt, Mali, Mexico, Pakistan\r\nand Sweden — convened that important meeting, with the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) serving as\r\nsecretariat. Seventy-one Heads of State or Government and\r\n88 ministerial representatives participated, making it the\r\nlargest gathering of world leaders held up until then. It was\r\nthe first truly global summit conference in history,\r\ninaugurating the series of major international development\r\nconferences of the 1990s and our collective assault on\r\npoverty.\r\nAt the World Summit for Children, the high\r\nexpectations of the international community immediately\r\nfollowing the end of the cold war were translated into\r\ncommitments to children. The participants pledged to\r\nachieve seven major goals and 20 supporting goals relating\r\nto the survival, health, nutrition, education and protection\r\nof children by the year 2000. The General Assembly, in\r\nits resolution 45/217 of 21 December 1990, urged the\r\ninternational community to work together to achieve\r\nthem.\r\nWhat can we say six years later? Are the promises\r\nmade to children in 1990 being kept? How have the\r\nworld’s children fared?\r\nThe findings in the report, contained in document\r\nA/51/256, on the progress that has been made since the\r\nWorld Summit for Children are on the whole a cause for\r\ncelebration — and we did just that two weeks ago in the\r\nTrusteeship Council Chamber on the sixth anniversary of\r\nthe Summit, with the participation of children, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, representatives of the\r\ninitiating countries, the Executive Director of UNICEF\r\nand others. It is not often that we are able to report global\r\nbreakthroughs in the field of development, so we are\r\nparticularly encouraged that we now can point to\r\nconsiderable and widespread progress for children, who\r\nare our collective future.\r\nAlthough there is considerable variation across\r\ncountries and regions, information we have from 90\r\ncountries suggests an encouraging trend towards the\r\nachievement of the majority of the goals for children in\r\nmost countries. The greatest progress has been in the\r\ncontrol of preventable diseases. Immunization continues\r\nto reach approximately 80 per cent of all children before\r\ntheir first birthday, now saving 3 million young children\r\nevery year. Polio has been eradicated from large parts of\r\nthe world and, with continued effort, this scourge should\r\ngo the way of smallpox by the year 2000. Major progress\r\nhas been made towards the elimination of neonatal\r\ntetanus. Guinea worm disease, which sapped the energies\r\nof millions of people only five years ago, is now on the\r\nverge of elimination, having declined by 97 per cent.\r\nThere has been dramatic improvement in home\r\nmanagement of diarrhoea, the second leading cause of\r\nchild deaths. The use of oral rehydration therapy has\r\ndoubled over the past five years and is now saving the\r\nlives of some 1 million children every year. Some\r\n1.5 billion more people are consuming iodized salt today\r\nthan in 1990, preventing the largest single cause of\r\npreventable mental retardation in children. Vitamin A\r\nsupplementation and fortification to prevent blindness and\r\nimmune-system damage to young children is up in many\r\ncountries. Access to safe water has improved\r\nconsiderably. Some 82 per cent of all primary-school-age\r\nchildren are now enrolled.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 14 October 1996\r\nThese would be formidable achievements in any\r\ncircumstances, but the fact that so much progress has been\r\nmade in a period of unprecedented population growth,\r\nproliferating conflicts, widening gaps between rich and poor\r\nand cutbacks in government budgets and development\r\nassistance attests to the increased importance of children on\r\nthe international agenda. It demonstrates the effectiveness\r\nof the strategies and low-cost interventions being used to\r\nimprove children’s lives.\r\nMember States should feel encouraged by this\r\nperformance. I am proud that the United Nations — whose\r\nwork in development often goes underreported and\r\nunrecognized — has been able to make such an important\r\ncontribution. And I want to take this opportunity to\r\nrecognize and commend the leadership role that UNICEF\r\nhas played in this United Nations success story. UNICEF\r\nwill continue to play an indispensable role in the future.\r\nThe children who spoke at the Summit\r\ncommemoration two weeks ago warned us, however,\r\nagainst self-satisfaction. They spoke with deep emotion on\r\nbehalf of their sisters and brothers throughout the world,\r\nwho are still being bypassed by progress. And the\r\nExecutive Director of UNICEF, Ms. Bellamy, reminded us\r\nthat progress made to date must be sustained and that\r\nspecial efforts will be needed to accelerate progress in areas\r\nwhere results have been disappointing to date.\r\nChild mortality, while declining, is still being reduced\r\ntoo slowly to reach the year 2000 goal. New estimates\r\nshow that maternal mortality is a bigger problem than was\r\npreviously thought. There has been little or no improvement\r\nin child malnutrition. The quality of basic education leaves\r\nmuch to be desired, resulting in high drop-out rates,\r\nparticularly for girls. Safe drinking-water supply has not\r\nkept pace with population growth, especially in cities, and\r\nprogress in providing adequate sanitation has lagged even\r\nmore. Millions of children continue to lose their childhoods\r\non battlefields and streets, in prostitution and sweatshops.\r\nIn presenting this report to the General Assembly,\r\ntherefore, I want to stress the need to reaffirm the\r\ncommitments made to children in 1990. The progress I\r\nhave outlined today must generate greater momentum. We\r\nmust redouble our efforts to achieve the year 2000 goals,\r\nadjusting them where necessary and tailoring the strategies\r\nused to achieve them to the realities of each country. Civil\r\nsocieties will have to play a greater role, along with\r\nGovernments at all levels, if the goals are to be met.\r\nEconomic and social empowerment of the poor is\r\ncritically important. Increased investment in basic social\r\nservices for all, while necessary, will not be sufficient to\r\nsustain reductions in poverty. Economic policies aimed at\r\nmore equal distribution of land, credit and income are\r\nalso essential. We must increasingly use the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child — now nearly universal — as\r\na social tool to reach the unreached and to meet the needs\r\nand respect the rights of the most disadvantaged, the most\r\nvulnerable and the children of minorities suffering under\r\ndiscrimination. Improving the status, well-being and\r\nopportunities of girls and women is particularly important.\r\nFollow-up to the World Summit for Children and the\r\nother global conferences of this decade needs to be\r\npursued in an integrated fashion, with full United Nations\r\nsystem coordination on the ground. A troubling trend has\r\nbrought development assistance to its lowest level in a\r\nquarter century must be reversed.\r\nThe report before the Assembly today tells us what\r\nworks in development. It tells us that international\r\ncooperation is getting measurable results. It tells us that\r\nsummits and global conferences can make a real\r\ndifference. It tells us that the twenty-first century can be\r\nbrighter if we have the political will to put children first.\r\nIt tells us that investing in children and women is the path\r\nto sustainable development.\r\nChildren are a prominent feature of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly. In addition to\r\naddressing this report in plenary and in the Second and\r\nThird Committees of the General Assembly, members\r\nwill be discussing the full range of children’s rights in the\r\nThird Committee and will soon have before them the\r\nimportant report on the impact of armed conflict on\r\nchildren, prepared under the leadership of Mrs. Machel.\r\nOur deliberations here over the coming months can\r\nhelp maintain and accelerate the pace of progress for the\r\nworld’s children. It is my hope that an end-of-decade\r\nreview will be held in the year 2000 and its results\r\npresented to the General Assembly to advance global\r\ncooperation on behalf of the world’s children into the\r\nnext century.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 14 October 1996\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention of\r\nmembers to document A/INF/51/3/Rev.1, which contains\r\nthe revised programme of work of the General Assembly\r\ncovering the remainder of October and the beginning of\r\nNovember, and which is now available to delegations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.25 a.m.\r\n5\r\n"
