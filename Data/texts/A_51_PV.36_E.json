(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 119 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of expenses\r\nof the United Nations (A/51/366/Add.4)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/51/366/Add.4, the Secretary-General informs me that,\r\nsince the issuance of his communications dated 17 and 20\r\nSeptember, and 2 and 11 October 1996, Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe has made the necessary payment to reduce its\r\narrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 45\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/348)\r\nThe President: Before calling on the first speaker on\r\nthis agenda item, I should like to propose, if there is no\r\nobjection, that the list of speakers for the debate on this\r\nitem be closed at 12 noon.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMrs. Castro de Barish (Costa Rica) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): On behalf of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nCosta Rica is pleased to express its satisfaction at your\r\nexcellent and innovative performance, Sir, in the exercise\r\nof the presidency of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China welcome the Bureau’s\r\ndecision to allocate this important item to the plenary,\r\nsince it concerns the follow-up to the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, held in Copenhagen. Our Group\r\nacknowledges with appreciation the initiative and effort of\r\nthe Government of Chile, a member of the Group of 77,\r\nand of China in convening this Summit on subjects of\r\nsuch great relevance and urgency. We believe that\r\nmultilateral cooperation is indispensable to meeting the\r\nfundamental challenges that affect the survival of our\r\npeoples on the eve of the twenty-first century and of the\r\nnext millennium.\r\nWe would like to stress that, in accordance with the\r\nagreements reached at the World Summit, a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly will be convened in the\r\nyear 2000 in order to assess the implementation of those\r\nagreements. Clearly, the follow-up of the Summit by the\r\nplenary and on that occasion fully justifies such effort.\r\nThe Commission for Social Development held a\r\nspecial session in order to implement the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration on Social Development and the Programme\r\nof Action of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nThe Commission reviewed its mandate, its terms of\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nreference, the composition of its membership, its scope of\r\nwork and the frequency of its meetings, and it also\r\nelaborated a multi-year programme of work. In this regard,\r\nwe wish to reiterate the importance that our Group attaches\r\nto the follow-up of the Summit by the Commission for\r\nSocial Development. This important Commission has been\r\nstrengthened by the decision to hold annual instead of\r\nbiennial sessions, to expand its membership from 32 to 46,\r\nand to ensure it a minimum of eight working days so that\r\nit can better and more efficiently fulfil its mandate. We\r\nexpect that the required resources will be made available.\r\nThe Group is pleased that the Commission adopted a\r\nresolution that called for the implementation of agreed\r\nmeasures to eradicate poverty and for strengthened\r\ninternational cooperation to that end, and which also called\r\non the international community to mobilize additional\r\nfinancial resources that are both adequate and predictable to\r\ncontribute to poverty eradication.\r\nWe must acknowledge our responsibility to leave to\r\nfuture generations a framework for this cooperation. True\r\nsecurity is global. Poverty and exclusion should not be the\r\nonly perspectives for two thirds of humankind. It is not\r\npossible to ignore the inequality of world development and\r\nthe ever-widening gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nDevelopment and social justice remain an elusive\r\ndream for poor people around the world. The Group of 77\r\nand China share this sentiment and reiterate the\r\ncommitments entered into at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. The Summit recognized that the peoples of\r\nthe world have demonstrated and reiterated the urgent need\r\nto focus on critical social problems, particularly poverty,\r\nunemployment and social exclusion. The task before us is\r\nto take due account of both the underlying and structural\r\ncauses and their unfortunate consequences, so as to reduce\r\nthe uncertainty and insecurity of their lives. We are\r\nconvinced that individuals should not only be the\r\nbeneficiaries of development, but should also have the\r\nopportunity to become the agents of their own development.\r\nHumankind has begun to recognize that poverty is not\r\nan inevitable part of the human condition. It can be\r\nconquered and eradicated from the face of the earth. We\r\nhave the resources and the organizational ability to do this\r\nsuccessfully. The issue has always been the political will of\r\nall Members of the United Nations to attain this objective\r\nand to pursue it within a framework of global partnership\r\nfor development, with the aim of waging a concerted fight\r\nagainst poverty and its consequences. This would give\r\nglobalization and interdependence a more profound\r\ndimension.\r\nIn their efforts to become integrated in the global\r\neconomy, many developing countries have been\r\ncompelled to undertake structural adjustments at\r\nenormous social and human cost. Although this process\r\nhas adversely affected all developing countries, the\r\nAfrican countries and the least developed countries in\r\nother parts of the world have been the most seriously\r\naffected by this critical situation.\r\nIn the absence of an external environment to support\r\ntheir national development efforts, many developing\r\ncountries continue to languish in poverty, backwardness\r\nand stagnation, and even to experience negative economic\r\ngrowth. Every year, between 13 million and 18 million\r\npeople, most of them children, perish from hunger and\r\nfrom poverty-related causes.\r\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women recognized\r\nthat the eradication of poverty will require implementing\r\nand integrating strategies at the national and international\r\nlevels, addressing all the critical areas of concern outlined\r\nin the Platform for Action that it adopted. The Conference\r\nemphasized, among other things, that empowering women\r\nis a critical factor in the eradication of poverty, and it\r\ngave particular priority to the situation of women living\r\nin poverty, recognizing the need to improve their access\r\nto income, education, health care and other resources.\r\nAs long as the developing countries remain on the\r\nperiphery of international decision-making, which would\r\nenable them to devise global solutions to the global\r\neconomic problems that affect them, this unfortunate state\r\nof affairs will continue. It needs to be faced resolutely\r\nand in a spirit of solidarity by both the developing\r\ncountries and the developed countries that are Members\r\nof this world Organization. After all, the United Nations\r\nis an Organization that, because of its very nature,\r\nprinciples and objectives, transcends all individual or\r\nnational interests to represent the interests of all. No\r\nbetter form of partnership has yet been proposed at the\r\nglobal level to address the major problems of an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world.\r\nOur Group supports the Secretary-General’s System-\r\nwide Special Initiative for Africa, which reinforces the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s. A major constraint on the\r\ndevelopment efforts of these countries is the critical loss\r\nof the financial and human resources to combat poverty\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nand underdevelopment. In an international climate in which\r\nthey are unable to secure adequate levels of investment or\r\nother financial sources to promote development, they must\r\ndepend almost exclusively on official development\r\nassistance. Regrettably, however, such assistance has\r\nplummeted over the past decade, dropping by as much as\r\n25 per cent in the past four years alone.\r\nEven more daunting, especially with regard to the\r\nheavily indebted poor countries, including those of Africa,\r\nis the continuing crisis of excessive external indebtedness.\r\nNotwithstanding the broad range of internationally\r\nsupported debt-relief measures carried out over the past\r\ndecade, the crisis continues to cripple the ability of these\r\ncountries to generate economic growth and development.\r\nThere is a critical need, therefore, to expand the current\r\ninternational debt strategy so that it becomes more\r\ncomprehensive, development-oriented and durable.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the approval of the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions’ proposal to reduce the overall debt\r\nburden of the heavily indebted poor countries to more\r\nsustainable levels. However, to enhance the initiative’s\r\nchances of success, we call on the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions to further refine it so as to make it less\r\nrestrictive by, for instance, reducing the adjustment period\r\nfrom six to three years and by modifying eligibility\r\nrequirements so as to better serve the legitimate interests of\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nWe reiterate that investing in people is as vital as\r\ninvesting in capital. Special attention should be paid to\r\nsound basic education, to skill formation and to training,\r\nwhich is a lifelong undertaking that improves the transition\r\nfrom school to work.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration, adopted by all the\r\nSummit participants, stressed that development and social\r\njustice are indispensable for the achievement and\r\nmaintenance of peace and security within and among our\r\nnations. Conversely, social development and social justice\r\ncannot be achieved in the absence of peace and security or\r\nof respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This\r\nbasic interdependence was recognized 50 years ago in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and has gained strength ever\r\nsince.\r\nThe Group appeals to all Member States and to the\r\nUnited Nations system to honour their commitments,\r\nparticularly with respect to the provision of adequate\r\nresources, to ensure full implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development. At the\r\ntwentieth annual meeting of the Ministers for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Group of 77 and China, held in New York\r\non 27 September 1996, the Ministers stressed the fact that\r\n1996 is the International Year for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty and that the General Assembly declared the years\r\n1997-2006 as the first United Nations Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty. In this context, the Ministers\r\nreaffirmed that the goal of eradicating poverty in the\r\nworld is an ethical, social, political and economic\r\nimperative that can be achieved only through a\r\nmultidimensional and integrated approach. They also\r\nemphasized that the commitments agreed upon at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development should be fully\r\nimplemented. To this end, they look forward with interest\r\nto the special session of the General Assembly in the year\r\n2000, which will review and appraise the outcome of the\r\nSummit with a view to considering further initiatives on\r\nthe eradication of poverty.\r\nLet us therefore make every effort to fully realize\r\nthe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action,\r\nwith their lofty principles and commitments, to fulfil the\r\njust aspirations and urgent needs of all our peoples on a\r\nuniversal basis as we begin the new millennium.\r\nMr. Camacho-Omiste (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for the delegation of Bolivia, in\r\nits capacity as coordinator of the Rio Group, to make this\r\nstatement on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,\r\nCosta Rica — representing the countries of Central\r\nAmerica — Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nUruguay and Venezuela.\r\nThe Rio Group believes that at the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, one of the most important events\r\nof our times, the international community recognized the\r\nneed to adopt urgent measures to check social problems.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development\r\nand the Programme of Action adopted at that time\r\nestablished the guidelines for the creation of a just society\r\nfor all and for effectively meeting human needs, on the\r\nbasis of democracy, human rights, equality, social justice,\r\ntolerance and respect for diversity.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction, and particularly its 10 commitments, made\r\neconomic and political issues the focus of international\r\ndebate. The key element of Copenhagen is the\r\ninterrelationship between analysis and processes, which\r\nwere previously approached in a partial and fragmented\r\nmanner, and an emphasis on the fact that poverty is a\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nworldwide concern and a threat to world peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAt the conclusion of the series of high-level world\r\nConferences organized under the auspices of the United\r\nNations in the course of the 1990s, we noted that their\r\ncommon denominator was the promotion of economic and\r\nsocial justice, with the fundamental objective of\r\napproaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted\r\nmanner. The Declaration and Programme of Action\r\nestablish an interrelationship between the outcome of the\r\nSocial Summit and agreements reached prior to the World\r\nSummit on Children in 1990, followed by the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development in\r\nJune 1992, the World Conference on Human Rights in June\r\n1993, the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States in April\r\nand May 1994, the International Conference on Population\r\nand Development in September 1994, the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women in September 1995, and the Second\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements\r\n(Habitat II) in June 1996.\r\nThe General Assembly, at its fiftieth session, included\r\non its agenda the item “Implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development”, and in\r\nconsidering in plenary the report of the Summit emphasized\r\nthe nature of that Conference, pointing out its role as the\r\nfoundation for the elaboration of national and international\r\nsocial development policies.\r\nIt also decided that a revitalized Commission for\r\nSocial Development, together with the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the Assembly itself, would constitute a “three-\r\ntiered intergovernmental process” in the follow-up to the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General describes the\r\nmeasures taken in the wake of the adoption of resolution\r\n50/161, and draws attention in particular to commitment 2\r\nof the Copenhagen Declaration and to chapter 2 of the\r\nProgramme of Action, concerning the observance in 1996\r\nof the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty and\r\nthe proclamation of the first United Nations Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty (1997-2006).\r\nIn this context, the Heads of State and Government of\r\nthe countries of the Rio Group, meeting in the city of\r\nCochabamba, Bolivia, on 3 and 4 September 1996,\r\nreaffirmed our Governments’ resolve to overcome poverty,\r\nmalnutrition, exclusion, lack of access to health services,\r\nand illiteracy, through policies leading to sustainable\r\neconomic development in the medium and long term.\r\nOur leaders appealed to the international financial\r\ninstitutions to strengthen their support in the fight against\r\npoverty by providing resources and technical assistance to\r\nnational programmes.\r\nThe countries of the Rio Group reaffirm their\r\nsupport for the holding of a special session in the year\r\n2000 to undertake an overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit and to\r\nconsider further measures and initiatives.\r\nAs a complementary measure to the Summit for\r\nSocial Development, the 20/20 initiative recognized the\r\nobjective that to achieve the eradication of absolute\r\npoverty, we must formulate a broad range of policies and\r\ntake actions at all levels. The Oslo consensus on the\r\n20/20 initiative pointed out that basic social services must\r\nbe made universal and that their beneficiaries should\r\npreferentially be the poorest and most vulnerable sectors.\r\nAs stated in the Declaration of Cochabamba, we the\r\nmember countries of the Rio Group undertook to continue\r\nto implement favourable policies to enable economic\r\nagents, in particular small and medium businesses, to\r\ncreate productive jobs with livable remuneration levels.\r\nWe also undertook to promote education, training and\r\nsocial skills, with priority given to the more vulnerable\r\nsectors of our populations.\r\nIn this context, the member countries of the Rio\r\nGroup reiterate their support for resolution 48/98 of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which calls upon the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to draft a conceptual framework of a programme\r\nfor the preparation for and observance of the International\r\nYear of Older Persons in 1999.\r\nThe global theme of the year, “Towards a society for\r\nall ages”, constitutes an appeal for the participation of all\r\ngenerations and organizations from all sectors of society.\r\nThis sends a message that all men and women, of any age\r\nor status, have a valuable contribution to make to society.\r\nThis in turn helps to promote dialogue between\r\ngenerations and social harmony.\r\nThe member countries of the Rio Group consider\r\nthat with the International Year of Older Persons we will\r\ncome closer to achieving the ultimate objective of social\r\nintegration, which is to create a society for all, in which\r\neach individual will have an active role to play.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Mr. President, I know how important it is to you\r\nthat we be concise in our statements, and I am aware of the\r\ngreat concern you have for making the best possible use of\r\nthe time allotted to us. That is your mark of distinction.\r\nAfter reiterating to you the congratulations of my\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, I would like to turn to agenda\r\nitem 45, entitled “Implementation of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development”. I also endorse the\r\npoints made by the Ambassador of Costa Rica in his\r\nstatement here on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nA total of 118 heads of State and Government and\r\nover 800 non-governmental organizations all acknowledged\r\nin March 1995, at Copenhagen, Denmark, the vital\r\nrelationship between social development and improving the\r\nhuman condition. Commitments were undertaken to work\r\nurgently to attain the goals set, principles for action were\r\ndetermined, and directives were provided for implementing\r\nand following up the outcome of the Summit.\r\nWhat is the situation almost 18 months later?\r\nFollowing the adoption of General Assembly resolution\r\n50/161, we now have the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nwhich gives us an overview of the initiatives and actions\r\nundertaken as part of the follow-up to the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development. The efforts made by the United\r\nNations system to coordinate follow-up activities to the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences, whose common\r\ndenominator is development, are immediately evident.\r\nMy delegation would like to make the following\r\nassessment of the Social Summit. Three major themes\r\nemerged at the Conference: the battle against poverty and\r\nmeasures to promote development; the involvement of civil\r\nsociety; and the need for financial resources.\r\nIn connection with the first issue, the debate held in\r\nthe Economic and Social Council on the coordination of the\r\nactivities of United Nations bodies to eradicate poverty\r\nyielded objective, balanced and clear conclusions.\r\nCombating poverty is primarily the responsibility of\r\nGovernments, which must formulate, execute and\r\nstrengthen national plans and programmes.\r\nThe international community is duty-bound to\r\ndischarge the commitments it has undertaken. Poverty can\r\nbe national or regional; but its origin always — in one way\r\nor another and to varying degrees — has international\r\ndimensions. As a result, the implementation of plans and\r\nprogrammes to combat poverty succeed better through the\r\ndevelopment of increased solidarity, through honest,\r\nserious cooperation and through self-reliance and the\r\nshouldering of one’s full responsibilities, relying on a\r\nfoundation of social justice, equity and respect for others.\r\nWith regard to measures taken in favour of social\r\ndevelopment, we must recognize the work of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank and\r\nencourage them to redouble their efforts. Loans made\r\nwithin this framework must be harmonized with the\r\nspecial situations of the recipients in order to prevent\r\ninterest from accumulating at a dizzying rate. Recipient\r\npopulations should not arrive at an impasse, crippled by\r\ngrowing debts instead of enjoying sought-after and well-\r\ndeserved social well-being.\r\nThe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative\r\nfor Africa, which highlights the priorities of health,\r\neducation, water and food security, should become one of\r\nthe operational aspects of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nAt the institutional level, the United Nations\r\nCommission for Social Development will be expanded\r\nsoon through the election of new members. The General\r\nAssembly must provide that body with the necessary\r\nmeans to discharge its mandate and fulfil its role.\r\nThe involvement of civil society in social\r\ndevelopment is a growing trend. The increasing\r\ncommitment and activity of the non-governmental\r\norganizations, together with governmental responsibility\r\nand action, is weaving a new fabric of solidarity among\r\nindividuals, peoples and nations. This valuable, daily\r\ncontribution at the grass-roots level should be utilized in\r\nthe social sphere in a way and to an extent that are\r\ncompatible with the sovereign expression of States.\r\nHowever, the mobilization of human and material\r\nresources through non-governmental organizations is not\r\nenough in itself to meet the needs expressed or to satisfy\r\nthe priorities of peoples. This brings me to the oft-asked\r\nabout the financial resources needed to implement the\r\nsocial programmes and plans formulated at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and as part of its follow-\r\nup. The Summit’s conclusions included the 20/20\r\ninitiative, which the Oslo meeting, held in April 1996,\r\nfurther defined in order to make it operational. This opens\r\nup the possibility of allowing everyone to benefit from\r\nbasic social services, according to a realistic and precise\r\ntimetable.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nThat timetable was established on the basis of a\r\nredirection of available resources. It is to be followed by\r\nthe mobilization of additional resources and, finally, by an\r\nimprovement in the effectiveness and quality of services.\r\nBurkina Faso supports the 20/20 initiative and has\r\nagreed to participate in a pilot plan for its implementation.\r\nStill within the framework of the follow-up of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nBurkina Faso has set up an inter-ministerial follow-up\r\nnational committee, headed by the Prime Minister. This\r\ncommittee has three key tasks before it: to monitor the\r\nspecific implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development at all ministerial and\r\ninstitutional levels; to develop initiatives to consolidate and\r\naccelerate the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nSummit; and to monitor coordination of the various steps\r\ntaken at the national level.\r\nThe committee’s permanent secretariat provides a\r\nformal structure for negotiations, which have led to the\r\nelaboration of a national programme of activities. Burkina\r\nFaso, despite its limited resources, is preparing to continue\r\nits work following the holding of a national workshop to\r\nheighten people’s awareness of the outcome of the Summit.\r\nIn the short and long terms, combating unemployment\r\nis best done by adopting a global approach that takes\r\naccount of material, social and psychological factors. The\r\npromotion of Burkina Faso’s social sectors is in keeping\r\nwith its desire to build a just and unified society in the\r\nplace of the current one, in which destitution and the law\r\nof the market are shredding our social fabric. Burkina\r\nFaso’s social development policies are therefore focused on\r\neducation, health and the environment. Women are the\r\ndriving force in this regard because rapid progress cannot\r\nbe made without their participation in socio-economic\r\nactivities, an area in which they are already very active,\r\nparticularly in informal ways. These are some of the aspects\r\nof Burkina Faso’s follow-up to the Social Summit.\r\nI wish to conclude by stressing the need for genuine\r\npartnership. The coordination and complementarity of\r\nactivities and development programmes is increasingly\r\nnecessary at the intergovernmental and non-governmental\r\nlevels. We all still need to respect our commitments and the\r\nagreed priorities and programmes, and to work tirelessly so\r\nthat political will does not waver and the aspirations of our\r\npeople for justice and peace with solidarity can prevail.\r\nMr. Shah (India): Since this is the first time I have\r\nspoken, Sir, since you assumed the presidency, I would\r\nlike to begin by congratulating you on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession. You have already displayed some of your well-\r\nknown talent for organization and effectiveness, and my\r\ndelegation looks forward to working further with you to\r\nimprove the effectiveness and the image of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy delegation heard with interest the statement\r\nmade by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nlends its support to that statement.\r\nAt the World Summit for Social Development in\r\nCopenhagen, our leaders committed themselves to the\r\ngoal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive\r\nnational actions and international cooperation, as an\r\nethical, social, political and economic imperative of\r\nhumankind. At the international level, it was agreed to\r\nfocus attention on and support the special needs of\r\ncountries and regions in which there are substantial\r\nconcentrations of people living in poverty. They are the\r\nones who face the most serious difficulties in achieving\r\nsocial and economic development. The Summit reaffirmed\r\nrights in the areas of education, food, shelter,\r\nemployment, health and information, particularly for the\r\npurpose of assisting people living in poverty. On the other\r\ntwo core issues identified for the Summit, they committed\r\nthemselves to promoting the goal of full employment and\r\nsocial integration.\r\nThe world today stands at the crossroads of history,\r\neven as it struggles to free itself from the attitudes and\r\nconfines of the cold-war era. Certain paradigms of\r\ndevelopment that had placed the State alone at the centre\r\nhave had to be reversed significantly. National rivalries\r\nand competition, defined in the past along ideological\r\nlines, are searching for new identities and motivations.\r\nInterest in the cause of development, often defined in the\r\ncontext of a search for allies, is now giving way to an\r\nunfortunate questioning of the utility of international\r\ndevelopment cooperation. The pendulum has swung\r\ndecisively to the syndrome of private-sector-based growth\r\nand to a tendency to put an unfettered market system\r\nalone at the centre of the new scheme of things.\r\nWhile this enthusiasm is being pushed throughout\r\nthe world, practical experience is generating a search for\r\nand recourse to an approach that blends economic growth\r\nwith social justice and market imperatives with social and\r\nenvironmental concerns. There is a continued role for\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\npublic policy, both at the national and international levels,\r\nto tackle market imperfections and failures. Otherwise, the\r\npoor and the weak will suffer continued exclusion from\r\ngrowth and prosperity due to the imperfections and the\r\ntyranny of the market.\r\nAt both the Social Summit and the ninth session of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), the positive and negative effects of\r\nglobalization were reflected upon. It was also recognized\r\nthat the rapid processes of change and adjustment have\r\nbeen accompanied by intensified poverty, unemployment\r\nand social disintegration, and that they bring increased risks\r\nof instability and marginalization.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nTo succeed, any long-term strategy must place people\r\nat the centre. This centrality of people in the development\r\nprocess is extremely important. It was recognized in the Rio\r\nDeclaration and reaffirmed and expanded upon at\r\nCopenhagen. The central strategy for achieving social and\r\neconomic development to sustain human progress should be\r\nto empower the people themselves. The effort must be to\r\nempower every disadvantaged class and group, particularly\r\nwomen. This will be possible only when certain rights\r\nfundamental to human development are guaranteed to\r\npeople.\r\nIn today’s context, international cooperation remains\r\nessential to facilitate and accelerate national economic and\r\nsocial development. All countries, regardless of their\r\ngeographical location, are in need of social development\r\nand integration. The dominant causes for discord may be\r\ndifferent in different countries, but no society can claim to\r\nbe fully integrated. We have only to look around us to see\r\nthe exclusion and marginalization experienced by significant\r\nsections of the population in developed countries, due in\r\npart to human failings and imperfections of social\r\norganization and due significantly to the dictates of the\r\nmarket-based approach.\r\nThe core issues of poverty eradication, employment\r\ngeneration and social integration cannot be addressed\r\ncredibly without adequate resources, non-discriminatory\r\naccess to markets and the availability of modern\r\ntechnologies for invigorating economic and social progress.\r\nAt the national level, countries have to commit the\r\nresources required to secure the rights of the poor in terms\r\nof building infrastructure, building and strengthening\r\ninstitutions, formulating policies and designing strategies\r\nand mechanisms of monitoring and evaluation that permit\r\nsustainable implementation.\r\nThe father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi,\r\nmobilized the masses of India in our struggle for freedom.\r\nHe inspired an impoverished nation to win freedom from\r\nthe world’s mightiest empire by non-violent means. As\r\nIndia struggles towards its second freedom, the freedom\r\nfrom want, disease and ignorance, we go back to\r\nMahatma Gandhi and his technique of social mobilization\r\nof the people. Our strategy goes well beyond\r\nrepresentative governance and endeavours to involve more\r\nand more people at the grass-roots level. Our current five-\r\nyear plan, the eighth, stipulates that\r\n“it is necessary to make development a people’s\r\nmovement, and people’s initiative and participation\r\nmust become the key element to the whole process\r\nof development”.\r\nTo this end, in the last couple of years, we have\r\namended our Constitution to provide for decentralized,\r\nparticipative, village-level democratic institutions with\r\nstatutory representation to the socially disadvantaged\r\ngroups of our people. One third of all elective\r\nrepresentative posts at the local level have been reserved\r\nfor women. A bill has now been introduced in the Indian\r\nParliament to reserve for women one third of Federal and\r\nState legislative offices. It is our resolve to make the\r\nconcerns of gender and the rights of children, adolescents\r\nand youth the centre of all our decision-making, including\r\neconomic decision-making. Beginning next year with the\r\nninth five-year plan, India’s expenditure on education is\r\nplanned to rise from its present 3.7 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product to 6 per cent of GDP. The Common\r\nMinimum Programme, adopted by the United Front\r\nGovernment constituted after the elections earlier this\r\nyear, has also set for itself the target of eradicating\r\nabsolute poverty by the year 2005.\r\nIn Copenhagen our leaders adopted a visionary\r\ndocument that incorporates major commitments for\r\nnational action and international cooperation. It is\r\nessential that we put in place effective follow-up\r\nmachinery to translate these commitments into action. The\r\ndiscussions that have taken place so far in the\r\nCommission for Social Development and the information\r\nthat has been made available to the Commission show\r\nclearly that most of the follow-up action has been at the\r\nnational level. There has been very little progress in the\r\narea of international cooperation. The Commission should\r\ntake a more critical look at these aspects in its\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nforthcoming meetings. The synergy between national action\r\nand international cooperation should not be allowed to fall\r\nout of balance merely because of perceived domestic\r\nconstraints in the developed countries.\r\nThere is a clearly recognized need to increase\r\nsubstantially the resources available for international\r\ncooperation for social development. It is particularly\r\nshocking, therefore, that soon after the adoption of these\r\nmajor commitments, we are faced with the prospect of the\r\neleventh replenishment of the International Development\r\nAssociation at reduced real levels. Greater attention should\r\nbe paid to the commitments made to facilitate increased\r\ntransfer of real resources to the developing countries.\r\nLegitimate worldwide concern with social development\r\nought not simply to degenerate into additional\r\nconditionalities imposed on developing countries from\r\noutside. The social-development agenda cannot be viewed\r\nin isolation. The domestic resources needed for social\r\ndevelopment can be mobilized only if the economy is\r\ngrowing rapidly. A holistic approach has to be adopted in\r\nassessing the balance between expenditure on economic\r\nservices and expenditure on social services.\r\nThe entire United Nations system should be involved\r\nin the follow-up process. The Bretton Woods institutions\r\nand the specialized agencies, in particular the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO) and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), should be\r\ninvolved in the follow-up process in a coordinated manner.\r\nWe should look at not only the situation in developing\r\ncountries, but also the societal problems in developed\r\ncountries. My delegation supports the three-tiered structure\r\nfor follow-up, which is now in place, consisting of the\r\nCommission on Social Development as the functional\r\ncommission with primary responsibility; the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, with responsibility for coordination; and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, with responsibility for policy guidance.\r\nWe also welcome the decision to hold a special session of\r\nthe General Assembly in the year 2000 to review\r\nimplementation.\r\nFor their part, of course, the developing countries must\r\nincrease the availability of domestic resources by\r\nreorienting public expenditure and minimizing waste.\r\nHowever, the central question relating to the overall limits\r\nof available resources cannot be ignored. Given low per\r\ncapita income levels, sufficient resources cannot be\r\nmobilized for the programmes outlined at the Summit, even\r\nwith the best political will and expenditure policies. The\r\nonus therefore rests on the international community to\r\ngenerate a substantial increase in the flow of external\r\nresources for poverty eradication and social development.\r\nThis has to be achieved not just through conventional\r\nmeans, such as official development assistance, but also\r\nthrough measures in the areas of trade, development and\r\ntechnology transfer, in the clear recognition that\r\naccelerated and sustained growth rates in the developing\r\ncountries will, in turn, generate greater trade and\r\nemployment benefits for developed countries.\r\nI believe that in the post-cold-war era our countries\r\nhave, through the United Nations, entered into a major\r\ncompact for national economic and social development\r\nand international cooperation to this end. This compact is\r\nembodied in the outcomes of the series of world\r\nconferences held over the past five years. We now have\r\nto ensure an effective and coordinated follow-up of the\r\ncommitments undertaken, including commitments for\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nMr. Albín (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nFirst, I wish to state that my delegation associates itself\r\nwith the statement made by the Permanent Representative\r\nof Bolivia on behalf of the Rio Group.\r\nLast year the General Assembly adopted the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration on Social Development and\r\nProgramme of Action, which resulted from the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, thereby enshrining social\r\ndevelopment as an essential element in human progress.\r\nThe growing deterioration in the living conditions of\r\nmillions of people and the alarming spread of poverty and\r\nunemployment were the elements that triggered\r\nconsideration of this matter at the highest political level.\r\nThe outcome of the Summit stressed the importance of\r\nurgent and decisive action on the part of Governments\r\nand the international community as a whole. Social\r\ndevelopment now constitutes an undisputed priority on\r\nnational agendas, as well as on that of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction provide a framework for governmental action at\r\nthe national and international levels. We, the Member\r\nStates, are obliged to fulfil the commitments that we\r\nfreely entered into there. In accordance with\r\ncommitment 1 of the Copenhagen Declaration, and\r\ndespite the economic difficulties we have faced, social\r\npolicy currently absorbs most of Mexico’s budget. Of\r\nevery 100 pesos spent by the Government, 54 pesos —\r\nmore than half — are spent on measures to improve the\r\nliving conditions of people, families and communities.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nSocial expenditure accounts for 9.2 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product.\r\nIn Mexico, social support policies cover the entire\r\npopulation and include special measures for those who live\r\nin conditions of extreme poverty. We are aware that\r\nadditional efforts are required to break the vicious circle of\r\nmalnutrition, poor health, educational deficiencies and lack\r\nof opportunities. Our main challenge on the eve of a new\r\nmillennium is to meet the needs of approximately 22\r\nmillion Mexicans who live in extreme poverty.\r\nIn order to implement commitment 2 of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration, Mexico has accepted the\r\nimperative ethical, social, political and economic need to\r\novercome poverty by taking vigorous action, with the main\r\nshort-term objective of mitigating the effects of deficiencies\r\nand the long-term aim of establishing conditions for the\r\nsustained reduction of economic and social inequality.\r\nAs was emphasized at the Summit, overcoming\r\npoverty is linked to better control over resources and the\r\nexpansion of social participation in decision-making\r\nmechanisms. To that end, we have promoted an integrated\r\npolicy tied to the strengthening of democracy in the\r\ncountry. In his second Government report, President Zedillo\r\nannounced that, on the basis of an integrated and federalist\r\napproach, efforts being carried out separately in the areas\r\nof food, health and basic education had been coordinated in\r\na more coherent and effective programme. The Government\r\nof Mexico will continue to take whatever measures are\r\nnecessary to achieve the goals agreed upon at the Summit.\r\nA consideration of the subject of social development\r\nfrom a broad-based and integrated perspective was one of\r\nthe most significant achievements of the Summit. It stressed\r\nthe direct relationship between the promotion of equality of\r\nopportunity, economic growth and the international\r\neconomic context. It was recognized that social\r\ndevelopment is the responsibility of each country, and it\r\nwas accepted that in order to achieve it, a stronger\r\ncollective effort by the international community is needed.\r\nIn this context, the contribution of the United Nations\r\nsystem is crucial. The agencies of the system must\r\nincorporate the goals agreed upon in Copenhagen into all\r\ntheir activities, so as to give effective support to\r\nGovernments in translating these commitments into concrete\r\npolicies and programmes.\r\nAt the intergovernmental level, the General Assembly,\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Commission for\r\nSocial Development must continue, in timely fashion, to\r\nfollow up implementation of the commitments undertaken\r\nat the Summit. The Economic and Social Council has\r\ntaken an important step in substantially changing the\r\nnature of the Commission for Social Development by\r\ngiving it a central role in following up the implementation\r\nof agreements made in Copenhagen.\r\nStrengthening the mandate of the Commission, in\r\naddition to establishing new working methods,\r\nannualizing meetings, expanding the membership and\r\nadopting a multi-year programme of work to address all\r\nthe issues contained in the Copenhagen Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action, should allow the Commission to\r\nfollow up the implementation of these commitments in an\r\neffective, integrated and broad-based manner. The\r\nCommission will provide a suitable forum for an\r\nexchange of national experiences, assess achievements\r\nand obstacles and formulate necessary substantive\r\nrecommendations to achieve the goals established. The\r\nestablishment of inter-agency task forces within the\r\nsystem has encouraged greater coordination and made a\r\npositive contribution to this effort.\r\nAs the Copenhagen Declaration states, the human\r\nbeing must be at the centre of development, and in this\r\ncontext, economy must be aimed at meeting the needs of\r\nall members of society. We must attach the highest\r\npriority to promoting social progress and improving the\r\nhuman condition, on the basis of the full participation of\r\nall. Economic development with social justice is one of\r\nthe central objectives that we established at the Summit.\r\nThe Government of Mexico today reiterates its\r\ncommitment to this fundamental cause.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): At its fiftieth session\r\nthe General Assembly reaffirmed the commitments made\r\nby the Heads of the State or Government at Copenhagen\r\nand decided to give highest priority to the national,\r\nregional and international policies and actions for the\r\npromotion of social progress, justice and the betterment\r\nof the human condition, based on full participation by all.\r\nBy its resolution 50/161, the General Assembly\r\nunderlined the critical importance of national action and\r\ninternational cooperation for social development and\r\nattributed this specific role to the United Nations system\r\nfor implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development. We thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report outlining the progress made\r\nso far and the initiatives he proposes to take for the\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social\r\nDevelopment and Programme of Action.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nWe are also happy that the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment is being discussed and considered in plenary\r\nmeeting. Our general concerns on the matter have largely\r\nbeen expressed in the statement made by Costa Rica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77. I should like to elaborate on the\r\nspecific issues of concern for Bangladesh and the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWe all recall that last year the Assembly recognized\r\nthat the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action in developing countries, in particular\r\nAfrica and the least developed countries, would need\r\nadditional financial resources and more effective\r\ndevelopment cooperation and assistance. The Assembly also\r\nconcurred in the view that substantial debt reduction would\r\nbe needed to enable developing countries to implement the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action, as\r\nset out in commitment 9 of the Declaration and paragraph\r\n90 of the Programme of Action. The debt burden of many\r\nleast developed countries, particularly in Africa, is\r\nunsustainable. Although a few steps have been taken to\r\ngive debt relief to these countries, the measures remain\r\ngrossly inadequate.\r\nWe recognize with satisfaction that the important\r\n20/20 initiative, which was endorsed by the Copenhagen\r\nSummit, was also endorsed and its importance reiterated by\r\nthe General Assembly. We are also happy to note that at a\r\nrecent meeting in Oslo consensus was reached with regard\r\nto the implementation of this important initiative and its\r\nuniversal application. We commend the Governments of\r\nNorway and the Netherlands for organizing the meeting,\r\nwhich outlined the framework and modalities for\r\nimplementation of the 20/20 initiative. We believe that the\r\nmain focus for the 20/20 initiative should be the effective\r\nand efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor\r\nand disadvantaged and other vulnerable sectors of our\r\nsociety.\r\nWe are encouraged to note that the Commission for\r\nSocial Development called upon the international\r\ncommunity to seek to mobilize additional financial\r\nresources that are both adequate and predictable to\r\ncontribute to poverty eradication. During discussions in\r\nParis in 1990 on the Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s, and subsequently in\r\nmany international conferences, our partners in development\r\nexpressed commitments to come forward with 0.15 per cent\r\nof gross national product as official development assistance.\r\nIt is disquieting that only a few countries have met the\r\ntarget. We urge others to fulfil their commitments in this\r\nregard.\r\nWe look forward to the outcome of the study the\r\nSecretary-General is to undertake with the World Bank,\r\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and multilateral\r\ndevelopment institutions on the impact of structural\r\nadjustment programmes on economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The study will indicate ways and means to\r\nassist adjusting countries in creating conditions for\r\neconomic growth, job creation, poverty eradication and\r\nsocial development. In this context, we recall the concept\r\nof development with a human face, and we are convinced\r\nthat this concept continues to be important and valid for\r\nmany of our countries.\r\nAt the international level, Bangladesh put forward\r\nproposals for follow-up of the outcome of the Social\r\nSummit. One of the proposals was the establishment of a\r\nhigh-level task force by the Secretary-General in\r\nconsultation with the heads of the World Bank, IMF and\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), with a view to\r\nmaking the entire multilateral system more responsive to\r\nthe war against poverty. The task force would also aim at\r\nachieving proper coordination between the United Nations\r\nand those bodies and at introducing transparency in their\r\nwork. It could also contribute to outlining procedures to\r\nmake possible the active participation of developing\r\ncountries in the decision-making processes of the World\r\nBank, IMF and WTO.\r\nThe other proposal by Bangladesh was for the\r\nestablishment of an independent commission. Bangladesh\r\nproposed that such a commission include eminent\r\npersonalities under the leadership of the chairperson of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development. The\r\nCommission would submit recommendations on such\r\ncrucial issues as cancellation of outstanding debts,\r\nproviding a more human face to structural adjustment and\r\nmatching the official development assistance targets set in\r\n1981 at the Paris Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries. It would also look into the implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action in these countries.\r\nIn response to our démarche, the Secretary-General\r\ninformed us that he had submitted to the executive heads\r\nof the specialized agencies a series of proposals for the\r\nestablishment of inter-agency task forces aimed at\r\nproviding strong coordinated support for country-level\r\naction, in the areas of the extension of basic social\r\nservices, access by the poor to productive assets and\r\nemployment and the creation of an enabling environment\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nfor poverty eradication and social development. In this\r\ncontext, he also acknowledged that he had personally been\r\npursuing, with the heads of these institutions, the\r\nparticipation and close cooperation of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization, and that he\r\nintended to keep the progress being made under close\r\nreview through the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination.\r\nIn view of the least developed countries’ increasing\r\nmarginalization in world trade — a specific consequence of\r\nglobalization and liberalization — Bangladesh drew the\r\nattention of the current Chairman of the Group of Seven to\r\nthe concerns of the least developed countries. We felt that\r\nit would be expedient to do so, as most of our efforts at\r\ndevelopment, particularly social development, are seriously\r\naffected by the continued decrease in national income from\r\ntrade. In response, the Chairman of the Group of Seven\r\nassured the Prime Minister of Bangladesh that the Group of\r\nSeven would work with the least developed countries in our\r\neffort to face our development challenges. It is a matter of\r\ngreat satisfaction and encouragement that, in their Lyon\r\nSummit economic communiqué, the Group of Seven\r\nexpressed their firm commitment to further the integration\r\nof the least developed countries into the global economy\r\n“using the full range of policy instruments having an\r\nimpact on development.” (A/51/208, annex II, para. 37)\r\nThey have made a commitment to improve the access of\r\nthe least developed countries to their markets. They have\r\nalso encouraged other developed and developing countries\r\nto undertake similar measures.\r\nI wish to refer briefly to the action taken by\r\nBangladesh at the national level for the implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action. The Government has designated\r\nthe Ministry of Planning as the focal point for the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, which\r\nincludes the eradication of poverty as one of the key goals.\r\nThe implementation components are being allocated to\r\nconcerned ministries, divisions and agencies of the\r\nGovernment. The role of civil society in particular has been\r\nrecognized and, in fact, some of its members are being\r\ninvited to participate in inter-ministerial consultations so\r\nthat we can receive their views and input with regard to the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action.\r\nAt the regional level, the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation has launched a Poverty Alleviation\r\nProgramme pursuant to the Dhaka Declaration on Poverty\r\nEradication adopted in 1993. Under this programme, each\r\ncountry will, at the district level, form an evaluation\r\ncommittee — the Committee of Agents and Beneficiaries\r\nof Poverty Eradication at District Level — to take stock\r\nof and eventually coordinate all ongoing poverty-\r\nalleviation schemes. Of the six countries in the region that\r\nhave joined the scheme so far, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh\r\nhave identified and initiated programmes in one model\r\ndistrict.\r\nAbout 50 agencies working in the model districts at\r\nthe field level have started coordinating their action under\r\nthe guidance of the Ministry of Planning. The scheme,\r\nwhich is being elaborated in line with the 15-year\r\nParticipatory Perspective Plan of Bangladesh, calls for a\r\ncoherent integrated approach to address hard-core poverty\r\nin the district at the grass-roots level.\r\nI should like to welcome the important initiative to\r\nconvene a micro-credit summit in Washington, D.C., in\r\nFebruary 1997, aimed at helping 100 million families to\r\ncome out of poverty by the year 2005. We urge all\r\ncountries that are involved in poverty eradication at any\r\nlevel to participate in the summit. The provision of micro-\r\ncredit, especially to women, was recognized at the Social\r\nSummit as being an important tool for poverty\r\neradication. In this respect, Bangladesh is proud to share\r\nwith the international community its experience with the\r\nGrameen Bank.\r\nFinally, I should like to reiterate the fact that social\r\ndevelopment is a Charter obligation for all United Nations\r\nMembers. The preamble to the Charter makes repeated\r\nreference to social development and better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom. It also includes a clear commitment\r\nto employing international machinery for the promotion\r\nof the economic and social advancement of all peoples.\r\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations, when drafting\r\nthe Charter against the backdrop of the Second World\r\nWar, did not fail to see the foundations of durable peace.\r\nLet us work together to realize the depth of their vision.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nMr. Enkhasaikhan (Mongolia): My delegation first\r\nwishes to associate itself with the statement made earlier\r\ntoday by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nMongolia attaches particular importance to the\r\nconsideration in plenary meeting of agenda item 45, entitled\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development”. In our view, it will help to sustain\r\nthe momentum of the Summit — one of the largest\r\nmeetings of world leaders, which was crowned by their\r\ncollective commitment to fight poverty, create productive\r\nemployment and strengthen social integration. We believe\r\nthat consideration of this item will also promote an\r\neffective implementation of and an integrated and\r\ncoordinated follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration on\r\nSocial Development and Programme of Action, in tandem\r\nwith the results of the other major United Nations-\r\nsponsored conferences, in the economic, social and related\r\nfields.\r\nThe holding of these conferences has, indeed, brought\r\nissues relating to human well-being to the top of the agenda\r\nof the international community. As the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, rightly underlined in his\r\nstatement to the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nsocial problems that once could be confined within borders,\r\nnow spread across the world. Once considered to be the\r\nexclusive responsibility of national Governments, they are\r\nnow of global scale and require global attention.\r\nRaising global awareness of the fact that social\r\nproblems are a major source of tension — and fraught with\r\nthe increasing danger of disrupting the social and political\r\nfabric, both within and between States, led to specific\r\ncommitments being undertaken. Now is the time for those\r\ncommitments to be translated into action at the national and\r\ninternational levels. Having studied the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, my delegation wishes to make the\r\nseveral observations related to actions taken at the\r\ninternational level to implement the outcome of the Social\r\nSummit.\r\nWith regard to institutional adjustments, the\r\nCommission for Social Development, as part of the three-\r\ntiered intergovernmental process, has been entrusted with\r\nthe primary responsibility for the follow-up to and review\r\nof the implementation of the Summit. The Commission has\r\nbeen strengthened through an increase in membership, the\r\nholding of annual meetings and the reaffirmation of its\r\nmandate. We welcome the adoption of its multi-year\r\nprogramme of work for 1997-2000, which will focus on the\r\ncore issues of the Summit, as well as the introduction of\r\nsuch innovative working methods as forming panels of\r\nexperts and holding dialogues with the participation of\r\nvarious entities of the United Nations system, civil society\r\nand governmental delegations.\r\nIn order for the Economic and Social Council to\r\nprovide overall guidance and system-wide coordination in\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Summit, it is of\r\nsignal importance to harmonize and coordinate the multi-\r\nyear work programmes of all the relevant functional\r\ncommissions and to avoid duplication of work. In this\r\nrespect, my delegation looks forward to receiving the\r\nSecretary-General’s report containing comprehensive\r\ninformation on the mandates, composition, functions and\r\nworking methods of the functional commissions, expert\r\ngroups and bodies to be submitted to the Council early\r\nnext year.\r\nThe General Assembly’s role lies mainly in policy\r\nformulation and overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit. It is\r\ngratifying to note that the functional commissions of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, including the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development, the Commission on the\r\nStatus of Women, the Statistical Commission, as well as\r\nthe regional commissions, have all been undertaking\r\nimportant initiatives respectively to support the\r\nimplementation of the objectives set out in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nWith regard to the mobilization of resources, the\r\nimplementation of the Summit’s decisions calls for a\r\ngenuine political commitment on the part of the\r\ninternational community to increasing substantially\r\nresources for sustainable human development. We\r\nstrongly believe that the mobilization of additional\r\nfinancial resources for social development can be made\r\npossible even — to use a frequently quoted, notoriously\r\npopular term — “within existing resources” through, inter\r\nalia, the introduction and wider use of such innovative\r\nschemes as alternative packages of socially responsible\r\nstructural adjustment, the 20/20 concept and debt\r\nexchanges for social development. In this connection, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the Economic and Social Council\r\ndecision requesting the Secretary-General to prepare a\r\nreport, in cooperation with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, on all aspects of new and\r\ninnovative ideas for generating funds for globally agreed\r\ncommitments and priorities\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nApart from exploring ways and means of mobilizing\r\nnew and additional resources, the Mongolian delegation\r\nwishes to underscore the paramount importance of\r\nhonouring the long-overdue commitment to the 0.7 per cent\r\ntarget by those donor countries that have not yet done so.\r\nFinding an effective, development-oriented and durable\r\nsolution to the external debt problem of developing\r\ncountries — by, inter alia, reducing and cancelling the\r\ndebt — would undoubtedly help free resources for\r\ninvestment in social development. One might add that the\r\nrealistic assessment of the underlying political and\r\neconomic causes of the multiplying debt burden should be\r\nborne in mind when addressing this issue. Furthermore, my\r\ndelegation would find useful the inclusion of a set of\r\nvulnerability factors in the criteria for determining the\r\nsustainability of a country’s debt burden, an idea that is\r\ncurrently being developed by the International Monetary\r\nFund and the World Bank and to which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral refers in chapter V (G) of his report.\r\nPoverty means, among other things, lost\r\nopportunities — opportunities for adequate education and\r\ntraining and for equitable access to productive resources.\r\nFor the overwhelming majority of developing nations,\r\nhowever, the problem of poverty is infinitely more severe,\r\nverging on desolation and despair. Solutions must be sought\r\nthrough cooperative action, both nationally and\r\ninternationally. In this respect, we wish to emphasize the\r\nimportance of setting time-bound goals and targets for the\r\nsubstantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication\r\nof absolute poverty within a national context, as stipulated\r\nin the Copenhagen Programme of Action.\r\nMongolia supported the relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions to observe the International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty in 1996 and to proclaim the first\r\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty. It\r\nwould be only logical for national action to be\r\ncomplemented by a global strategy with time-specific goals\r\nto combat poverty. Along these lines, and in accordance\r\nwith resolution S-1996/1 of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment on strategies and actions for the eradication\r\nof poverty, we expect the forthcoming report of the\r\nSecretary-General on actions to be taken by the United\r\nNations system in preparation for the first United Nations\r\nDecade for the Eradication of Poverty to propose specific\r\nactivities for each year of the Decade in order to facilitate\r\nthe follow-up to and evaluation of such activities.\r\nTurning to our activities at the national level, I should\r\nlike to point out that immediately following the Summit,\r\nthe National Preparatory Committee, headed by a Cabinet\r\nMinister responsible for social policy, was entrusted with\r\na renewed mandate to ensure nationwide coordination of\r\nthe Summit follow-up. Given the urgent need to elaborate\r\nand implement a well-targeted strategy for the eradication\r\nof poverty, which is a relatively new phenomenon in my\r\ncountry, in 1994 the Government of Mongolia adopted a\r\nPoverty Alleviation Programme (PAP). Many social\r\nproblems have become acute and some new ones have\r\nemerged as Mongolia has entered the transition process\r\nfrom a centralized planning and state-subsidized social-\r\nsecurity system to a market economy with its own social-\r\nsafety arrangements.\r\nA study of social conditions in Mongolia, conducted\r\nprior to the formulation of the PAP, revealed that poverty\r\nhad increased dramatically since 1989 and, by early 1993,\r\nhad reached alarming proportions. In terms of per capita\r\nincome, 26 per cent of the population has been classified\r\nas poor, including 6 per cent who are in absolute poverty.\r\nChildren with single parents or no parents, disabled\r\npeople, elderly people and female-headed households with\r\nmany children were found to be especially vulnerable.\r\nWhile poverty is high in urban and rural areas alike, the\r\nsituation is particularly serious in the latter, which are the\r\nmainstay of the country’s economy. Poverty was also\r\nfound to have had a markedly negative effect on women,\r\ndue partly to a rapid increase in the number of female-\r\nheaded households. Indeed, 72 per cent of single heads of\r\nhouseholds, most of them female, live below the official\r\npoverty line, which simply implies a lack of access or\r\nlimited access to basic social services, including food,\r\nsanitation, shelter, basic education and primary health\r\ncare.\r\nThe overall aim of the PAP is to reduce the number\r\nof people in poverty from 26 per cent to 10 per cent by\r\nthe year 2000. It is focusing on strengthening the\r\ninstitutional capacities of government, at both the central\r\nand local levels, with regard to policy management and\r\npoverty monitoring; promoting human resources\r\ndevelopment by providing better access to health and\r\neducation opportunities; alleviating rural poverty; and\r\ndeveloping and strengthening the basic social-safety net,\r\namong other issues. Special emphasis is placed on\r\nincome-generation and the promotion of employment\r\nopportunities among small herders and the livestock\r\nsector in general. In an attempt to raise the income of the\r\nrural poor, the PAP is designed to restructure the rural\r\neconomy through market development and upgrading\r\nbasic infrastructures, targeting the poorest households for\r\nspecial credit and welfare schemes and promoting small-\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nscale rural industries in agro-processing and non-farming\r\nactivities.\r\nThe programme is decentralized, with most activities\r\ncarried out at the local and grass-roots levels, directly by\r\nlocal governments or through non-governmental\r\norganizations and cooperatives. To ensure coordination of\r\nPAP activities at the national level, a Poverty Alleviation\r\nCommittee, composed of representatives of sectoral\r\nministries and relevant non-governmental organizations, has\r\nbeen set up. The Committee undertakes its activities in\r\nclose synergy with the national focal point for the follow-up\r\nto the Summit.\r\nAs seen from the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nalmost 100 focal points have been set up at national level\r\nto ensure the implementation of the basic objectives of the\r\nSocial Summit. The establishment of the three inter-agency\r\ntask forces on basic social services, employment and\r\nsustainable livelihoods and the enabling environment for\r\neconomic and social development has proved to be\r\ninstrumental in providing United Nations system-wide\r\nsupport and assistance, through Resident Coordinators, to\r\nnational Governments in implementing the Summit goals.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my delegation’s\r\nsincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will\r\nhelp to generate renewed political will at the national and\r\ninternational levels to attain the objectives of sustainable\r\nhuman development.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): At the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, the international community\r\narticulated a new social contract at the global level, which\r\nbrought renewed hope to men and women throughout the\r\nworld. It marked a turning point in the history of\r\nhumankind for human-centred development, with a firm\r\ncommitment to giving social evolution the highest priority\r\nand to putting people at the forefront of global\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDuring the Summit, the leaders of the world pledged\r\nto ensure universal well-being and social progress in the\r\ntwenty-first century while outlining comprehensive policies\r\nand measures by which to meet those goals. Furthermore,\r\nto translate those promises into working realities, the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session stressed, inter alia,\r\nthe need for renewed, solid political will at the national and\r\ninternational levels to invest in people and their well-being\r\nso as to achieve the objectives of social development, and\r\nreiterated its call upon the world’s Governments to fulfil\r\ntheir commitments made at the Summit.\r\nAs for national-level implementation of the outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development, the Korean\r\nGovernment earlier this year formulated the Framework\r\nfor the National Welfare of the Twenty-first Century. This\r\nmaster plan is aimed at the achievement of a higher\r\nstandard of living for all Koreans by guaranteeing a stable\r\nlivelihood, expanding social and welfare services and\r\nimproving the social insurance system. The preparation of\r\nmedium-term strategies and programmes to realize this\r\nFramework is about to be finalized.\r\nFurthermore, my Government places particular\r\nemphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups, such as the\r\ndisabled, in the process of social development, in the firm\r\nconviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society\r\ncan be realized only when all people, irrespective of their\r\nphysical or mental disadvantages, are able to pursue a life\r\nof happiness and dignity based on stability and equality.\r\nIt was in that context that the Republic of Korea was\r\nthis year honoured to be the first recipient of the Franklin\r\nDelano Roosevelt International Disability Award in\r\nrecognition of my country’s noteworthy progress towards\r\nthe fulfilment of the United Nations World Programme of\r\nAction concerning Disabled Persons. I should like to take\r\nthis opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his message of congratulations to\r\nthe President of the Republic of Korea on that occasion.\r\nBoth President Kim’s acceptance speech and the\r\nSecretary-General’s message have been distributed as\r\nofficial documents of the General Assembly.\r\nTurning to the follow-up measures to the\r\ncommitment to international cooperation made by my\r\ndelegation during the Summit, we reaffirm our pledge\r\nvigorously to pursue all efforts towards that end. My\r\nGovernment has set out its objective not only to expand\r\nthe scale of our official development assistance in a way\r\nthat is commensurate with Korea’s economic strength, but\r\nalso to provide technical training for more than 30,000\r\npeople from developing countries by the year 2010. As a\r\nprimary step in the implementation process, this year we\r\nincreased our grant-type aid by 21 per cent and provided\r\ntechnical training for 1,100 people. Next year, we will\r\nincrease grant-type aid by an additional 30 per cent and\r\ninvite 1,200 people from developing countries for\r\ntraining.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report in document A/51/348\r\nprovides a good general overview of where exactly we\r\nstand in terms of implementing, in the broader context, the\r\noutcome of the Summit and, in a narrower context,\r\nresolution 50/161. My delegation believes that the progress\r\ndocumented in the report and, in particular, the setting-up\r\nof an appropriate framework within the United Nations\r\nsystem represent a positive initial step in the right direction.\r\nWhile we will actively continue with our own efforts\r\ntowards the implementation of the outcome at both the\r\nnational and international levels, my delegation wishes to\r\nunderline four specific areas to which particular attention\r\nshould be paid in the implementation process.\r\nFirst, coherent policies and partnerships must be\r\nforged among the United Nations, the international\r\ncommunity and donors if the goals of various international\r\nconferences, including the Social Summit, are to be\r\nrealized. Secondly, the United Nations system must\r\nfacilitate the implementation of conference outcomes at the\r\ncountry level through, inter alia, national capacity-building.\r\nThirdly, gender perspective must be effectively\r\nincorporated into the implementation of the Summit\r\noutcome. Fourthly, the more active involvement of civil\r\nsociety and other relevant actors — especially non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — must be ensured in the\r\nplanning, elaboration, implementation and evaluation of\r\nsocial policies at the national level, as should their\r\nmaximum participation in the United Nations process\r\nrelating to the Summit.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress that, in our\r\npursuit of global progress, human-centred development\r\nshould continue to be our foremost priority. It goes without\r\nsaying that human-centered development depends upon\r\nthree indispensable and closely interrelated factors: the\r\nprotection of fundamental human rights, the democratic\r\nparticipation of all sectors of society and the promotion of\r\nsocial welfare and equality.\r\nThe Republic of Korea will continue to provide its\r\nshare of contributions to the achievement of human-centred\r\ndevelopment and endeavour to implement the outcome of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development.\r\nMr. Somavía (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): It\r\nis a pleasure for me to address the Assembly with\r\nAmbassador Minoves-Triquell in the Chair.\r\nLast year, we met here in the General Assembly to\r\ncelebrate the success of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment at Copenhagen. Today, we are meeting to\r\nmake a first assessment of the initiatives being taken to\r\nimplement its agreements.\r\nMy comments are in line with the excellent\r\nstatements we have just heard from the Group of 77 and\r\nthe Rio Group, with which Chile fully agrees. In\r\nparticular, I appreciated the kind words addressed to Chile\r\nby Mrs. Emilia Castro de Barish.\r\nAs other delegations have noted, the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action constitute a new\r\nsocial contract at the global level. They represent the\r\nmost progressive commitment in the history of the\r\ninternational community to making the war against\r\npoverty, unemployment and social exclusion the principal\r\ngoal of the twenty-first century. The meeting of human\r\nneeds, and especially the needs of the poorest, should\r\nbecome the yardstick for progress in our societies. This\r\ngreat international consensus is embodied in the decision\r\nto make social and ecologically sustainable development\r\nand growth with equity and gender equality the major\r\nchallenge of our time.\r\nTo this end, we have undertaken 10 basic\r\ncommitments. Today, our task is to make them a reality\r\nthrough concrete measures and activities at all levels. The\r\nSocial Summit expressed the political will to take\r\nadvantage of a window of opportunity that has opened in\r\nthe world with the end of the cold war to let in fresh air\r\nand to overcome the age-old ideological intolerance and\r\nrivalries of power politics, which were impediments to\r\ntrue international solidarity and served only selfish self-\r\ninterest.\r\nThe commitments of the Social Summit opened the\r\ndoor to a new era of cooperation among nations based on\r\nthe security of the individual, above and beyond political,\r\ngeographical and cultural barriers. We must ensure that,\r\nin implementing them, we do not falsify those high ideals,\r\nfor the cold war is currently being replaced in the\r\ndevelopment sphere by a cold peace, a peace of\r\ninsensitivity and indifference within and among nations.\r\nA clear indication of this is the fact that developed\r\nsocieties have entered into a cycle of introspection and\r\ninsecurity, in which their attitude towards the dispossessed\r\nwithin and without their own countries has become\r\nincreasingly severe. Unfortunately, a similar attitude is\r\nemerging in the wealthy sectors of developing countries\r\nwith respect to their own have-nots. It would seem that,\r\nin a globalized and competitive world, coldness of feeling\r\nhas become the norm.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nOn this occasion, I should like to examine a topic that\r\nI view as one of particular importance, and I shall do so by\r\nraising 10 points. I am referring to the impact of the Social\r\nSummit on the operations of the United Nations and of the\r\nmultilateral system in general. We can say with satisfaction\r\nthat the Summit has made an important contribution to\r\nrevitalizing and strengthening the social sector. The\r\nimplementation of the Social Summit has become a\r\ndynamic stimulus for the reform and mobilization of the\r\nsystem as a whole. As I said, however, I wish to make 10\r\nconcrete points.\r\nFirst, the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the main United Nations organ of cooperation, has\r\nmade the commitment to eradicate poverty as its first\r\npriority. As a result, the nearly 130 Resident Coordinators\r\nhave been instructed to make themselves available to\r\nGovernments to cooperate in the preparation and\r\nimplementation of their anti-poverty policies. Mr. James\r\nGustave Speth has stated that, in its commitment to the\r\neradication of poverty, the UNDP must be what the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) was for the World\r\nSummit for Children and what the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund was for the Cairo International Conference\r\non Population and Development. In other words, we have\r\na clear operational United Nations presence at the national\r\nand local levels, and that is where the Summit will become\r\na reality.\r\nIn this respect, the March 1996 decision of the UNDP\r\nAdministrator to launch the Poverty Strategies Initiative,\r\nwhich to date includes 46 support programmes, was a\r\ntimely and valuable action within the context of UNDP’s\r\nsupport to more than 80 countries in its follow-up to the\r\nSummit commitments.\r\nSecondly, we have taken a significant step in the\r\nhistoric problem of the lack of coordination — and even\r\nanimosity — among various organizations of the United\r\nNations family. The four task forces that have been set up\r\non employment and sustainable livelihoods, basic social\r\nservices for all, the enabling environment for economic and\r\nsocial development, and women are undoubtedly an\r\nimportant advance. After a few years of experience here at\r\nthe United Nations, I would even qualify it as an amazing\r\nadvance, since we have become rather used to the\r\ninstinctive resistance with which the bureaucracies of the\r\nagencies, the programmes and the Secretariat greet the\r\nnotion of working together without wondering who will be\r\nable to claim the credit. The early results of the task forces\r\nhave been encouraging. If they are successful, they will\r\nhave made an important contribution to the task of\r\ncoordination, which is a responsibility of the Economic\r\nand Social Council.\r\nThirdly, the Commission for Social Development has\r\nbeen revitalized. As we all know, the Summit was\r\nnecessary precisely because we had completely lost sight\r\nof the political implications of social questions. Early in\r\nthis decade — and I say this with sorrow, because I value\r\nthe Commission for Social Development — that body was\r\nlanguishing in peaceful obscurity within the system,\r\ndiscussing important matters but with no real influence on\r\nthe overall workings of the United Nations. The concrete\r\nfact is that today, thanks to the Social Summit, the\r\nCommission has a new agenda and a new dynamic.\r\nFourthly, the Summit gave significant political\r\nsupport to the tripartite task of the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO) by advocating a modern vision of the\r\nrelationship between growth, social and economic\r\ndevelopment and job creation. That has put cooperation\r\nbetween Governments, businessmen and workers on the\r\npath towards a contemporary, innovative and creative\r\nattitude with regard to the links between society, security\r\nand employment. When so many Heads of State set\r\nemployment as a national priority, ILO must accept the\r\nresponsibility — and the challenge — of fulfilling that\r\ndemand.\r\nSimilarly, this year the Summit had an impact on the\r\nmost recent meeting of the Group of Seven at Lyon,\r\nFrance, where that Group, along with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, set world unemployment as a priority item. That\r\nis being followed up by the ILO-led inter-agency task\r\nforce.\r\nFifthly, until very recently, the relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nwas marked by a certain distant reserve. Today, I think\r\nwe can say that the links between them are closer, and I\r\nshould like to say why: In part, it is due to a deliberate\r\npolicy on the part of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to seek areas of\r\nagreement and cooperation with Michel Camdessus and\r\nJames Wolfensohn. But in addition, and importantly, it is\r\nthe result of the fact that the formulations and\r\ncommitments of the Summit have facilitated a meeting of\r\nthe minds with those institutions in developing joint and\r\nindividual actions.\r\nI wish to emphasize the recent efforts of the World\r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to adapt\r\ntheir development policies to a more social vision. Both\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ninstitutions are reformulating their public expenditure\r\npolicies for borrowing countries in order to incorporate\r\nsocial criteria in their recommendations, giving special\r\nemphasis to basic social services in health and education as\r\nan investment in human capital. These steps are important\r\nin terms of the Summit’s commitment to introduce a social\r\ndimension in the adjustment programmes of the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. However, bolder steps are still needed\r\nto be able to reach a broad conceptual consensus on\r\ndevelopment policies with the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nI remember having heard Michel Camdessus in a\r\ndialogue with the Economic and Social Council, at the\r\nbeginning of this year or last year, when he said that the\r\nSocial Summit was the first great document of the United\r\nNations with which he fully agreed. Someone asked him\r\nhow he could hold such an opinion when the Social\r\nSummit was strongly critical of the Fund’s structural\r\nadjustment programmes. He replied that views on structural\r\nadjustments could differ and that, in any case, these had\r\nbecome more flexible; the important thing was that the\r\nSocial Summit advocated that in order to have a sound\r\nsocial policy countries had to have a sound economy, and\r\non that basis cooperation was possible.\r\nIn that framework, and given the structural nature of\r\nemployment problems where macroeconomic policies play\r\na determining role, IMF and the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO) are organizing a joint meeting of\r\nministers of finance and labour as part of the follow-up to\r\nthe Summit. The purpose of this is that, for the first time,\r\nmacroeconomic policy, which determines many factors in\r\nthe labour market, will also be reviewed by ministers of\r\nlabour, who need to take other factors into account with a\r\nview to generating jobs.\r\nSixth, ties with the World Bank have become even\r\ncloser. After uncertain beginnings, when James Wolfensohn\r\nfirst appeared in the Economic and Social Council in\r\nGeneva in 1995, the new President of this institution has\r\nemphasized cooperation with the United Nations. The Bank\r\ncoordinates one of the follow-up task forces for the\r\nSummit. It has committed itself to the African initiative\r\nunder United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\ncoordination and has given the war against poverty much\r\ngreater momentum than it had before in the Bank. Recently,\r\nfor the first time, and I will refer to this later on, decisions\r\nhave been taken to begin to reduce the multilateral debt\r\nburden, despite the fact that, as the representative of the\r\nGroup of 77 mentioned, some of the provisions need to be\r\nmore flexible.\r\nSeventh, we welcome the fact that in implementing\r\nthe commitments of the Summit the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has adopted measures to strengthen its economic\r\nand social areas so that it can appropriately fulfil its role\r\nto give general orientation and supervise the coordination\r\nof the entire system with respect to the outcome of the\r\nSummit. This was stated at the last session where the\r\nsubject that was selected for coordination was the war\r\nagainst poverty.\r\nEighth, implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nprogramme calls for the mobilization of financial\r\nresources at the national and international levels, and we\r\nall know that we are today going through a stage of\r\nfalling official development assistance. Within this\r\nregrettable situation, certain initiatives aimed at redressing\r\nthe problem are discernable. Noteworthy on the\r\nconceptual level, for example, was the recent meeting of\r\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) which proposed a world\r\nassociation for development in order to achieve several\r\nobjectives of the Social Summit, including the halving of\r\nthe number of persons living in extreme poverty and\r\nuniversal primary education for all by the year 2015. As\r\nseveral other speakers have mentioned, the 20/20 concept\r\nis also making progress.\r\nWe should also mention the recent initiative to\r\nreduce the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries\r\nadopted at the last annual meeting of the World Bank and\r\nMonetary Fund to make use of new facilities which deal\r\nin particular with the multilateral debt. Those mechanisms\r\ncan be made more flexible, but we wish to point out that\r\none of the points which received more political pressure\r\nduring the Social Summit was, precisely, in the first\r\nplace, the cancelling of the bilateral debt by developed\r\ncountries, such as Denmark and Austria. In the second\r\nplace, something that up to the time of the Summit had\r\nnot yet been possible, there was a recognition that the\r\nmultilateral debt of heavily indebted countries is today the\r\nmain problem faced by those countries and that they must\r\nbe able to continue to borrow from multilateral agencies\r\nwhile at the same time receiving assistance with their\r\nprevious debt. This has started to occur and the political\r\nimpact of the Summit was unquestionably instrumental in\r\nthis decision.\r\nNinth, I wish to refer to the contribution of civil\r\nsociety to the Summit. This was fundamental to its\r\nsuccess, and at this follow-up stage it continues to be\r\nvital. So many things are happening that it is impossible\r\nto refer to them all but I have selected some of them as\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\na symbol of all the initiatives that are taking place to\r\nimplement the Summit. For example, in June this year,\r\nclose to the first anniversary of the Summit, the\r\nInternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which\r\nincludes 194 affiliated trade union organizations throughout\r\nthe world, took the follow-up to the Summit as one of its\r\nmain themes at its 16th World Congress held in Brussels,\r\nand asked its national members to initiate work together\r\nwith ILO with a view to implementing the Summit’s\r\ncommitments. I should also point out that the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, with more than 100 member\r\nparliaments, has mobilized around the Summit’s goals, and\r\nat its recent Inter-Parliamentary Council meeting in Beijing\r\nin September adopted a document on priority actions for\r\nthe implementation by parliaments of the outcome of the\r\nSummit. If we think only of these two items, 194 trade\r\nunion organizations asked by their central organ to promote\r\nthe objectives of employment at the national level and more\r\nthan 100 parliaments also resolved to take initiatives on the\r\nSummit, we realize how this process has been gaining\r\nground in the political and main social sectors in our\r\ncountries.\r\nThe same could be said of the International Council\r\non Social Welfare, one of whose major initiatives had to do\r\nwith a group of organizations which have constituted\r\nsomething termed “Social Watch”, an interregional effort by\r\ngrass-roots and research groups operating in many countries\r\nwhich are developing national case studies and also\r\ncompiling information at the global level on the specific\r\npurposes of the Summit. As can be seen, there is an\r\nenormous list. I have merely picked a few examples to\r\nshow how this is becoming part of society, apart from what\r\nwe can do here in the United Nations system.\r\nTenth, in this statement I have emphasized the impact\r\nof the Summit on the United Nations system and civil\r\nsociety because I think this has been truly important.\r\nHowever, we cannot forget that it is at the national\r\ngovernment level where we must first reflect our will to\r\ncarry forth our commitments. We see with satisfaction that\r\nthe Secretary-General refers to replies from over 100\r\nGovernments to his appeal to prepare goals and objectives\r\nin order to implement the commitments made at the\r\nSummit. The number of replies shows that the momentum\r\nof Copenhagen has not been lost. In many cases, the\r\nnational preparatory committees for the Summit are still\r\noperational. There is no doubt, however, that it is at the\r\nnational level where we must do more, especially in terms\r\nof the commitment to formulate or strengthen and\r\nimplement, preferably this year, national plans to eradicate\r\npoverty. It is at the country level where we must establish\r\nthe foundations for implementing the commitments, with\r\nthe firm will of our Government, so that social\r\ndevelopment will become the new commitment of the\r\nsocial contract, as mentioned at the outset.\r\nRegional governmental action is also important, and\r\nalmost all regions have taken regional initiatives. I will\r\nmention only the one in which we were involved, which\r\nwas the follow-up to the Summit in which we organized\r\na hemispheric summit on the eradication of poverty and\r\ndiscrimination, held in Chile in January 1996.\r\nAs I approach the conclusion of my statement, I\r\napologize for its length, but some of you know how\r\npassionate I am on this subject, so I am sure that you will\r\nallow me to take a little more time than most other\r\ndelegations have been taking.\r\nWe must emphasize that the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly set for the year 2000 will be of historic\r\nimportance and will provide an opportunity for many\r\nHeads of State or Government to participate. Many\r\nPresidents have already told me, “prepare the session for\r\nthe year 2000 well, because you are going to see me at\r\nthe General Assembly. Don’t just put it together at the\r\nlast minute, because I will be there to see what we have\r\ndone five years after the Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.”\r\nThat is why it is essential to begin to prepare in\r\nadvance that great gathering with the participation of all\r\nMember countries of the system, just as we prepared for\r\nthe Summit with a broad Preparatory Committee in which\r\neveryone had a right to speak his mind. We must prepare\r\nsimilarly for the special session of the General Assembly,\r\nand in particular we must open it to all the countries\r\nwhose Heads of State were in Copenhagen. It would be\r\nabsurd if the countries whose Heads of State were in\r\nCopenhagen were not at the special session as well. I will\r\nnot go into the details of this, but what I wish to convey\r\nis that we bear a major political responsibility in\r\npreparing that special session of the General Assembly\r\nvery well. It will not be just any session of the General\r\nAssembly. It will be the result of this major process now\r\nunder way.\r\nClearly, the 10 points I have mentioned were not\r\nmade with the objective of concluding that all is well and\r\nthat because of the realization of the Social Summit there\r\nis nothing to worry about. Obviously, that is not the case\r\nin many respects. What I wished to do was highlight the\r\nsignificant impact the Summit has had on the work of the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ninstitutions of the multilateral system, which I believe is\r\nextremely significant.\r\nI wish to conclude by making three substantive\r\ncomments. Firstly, the Social Summit will not have been a\r\nreal success over time if it is not a success for Africa and\r\nthe least developed countries. One of the results of the\r\nSocial Summit of which I am proudest is the special\r\ncommitment made to Africa. It is the first time in history\r\nthat almost 120 Heads of State have affirmed that African\r\nand other least developed countries should be given\r\npolitical priority in the area of cooperation. I must say that\r\nI personally fought to achieve that commitment, even, at\r\ntimes, in the face of a lack of understanding by other\r\ndeveloping countries. But we did this because Chile is\r\ndeeply convinced that Africa requires and deserves\r\ninternational solidarity and a major flow of financial and\r\nmaterial support. In their policies of cooperation, the United\r\nNations and the developed countries must carry out\r\neffectively this commitment to Africa. The initiative for\r\nAfrica is a good beginning, especially because for the first\r\ntime — and this was of great interest to me now that Chile\r\nis on the Security Council — it links questions of security\r\nand development, a fundamental factor in the internal\r\nreality of every country. However, this initiative for Africa\r\nis not sufficient, and we most go far beyond it.\r\nSecondly, the Summit will not be a success unless it\r\nalso succeeds in making progress on the issue of gender\r\nequality and equity. It was also the first time in history that\r\na gathering of Heads of State, not technical or ministerial\r\nmeetings, raised the political standing of women’s rights as\r\na commitment of the international community.\r\nIn this respect, I would like to share an observation\r\nwith the Assembly. The other day I was looking around this\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall during the general debate in which\r\nour Ministers participated, and I noticed the overwhelming\r\nabsence of women in delegations. Today it is somewhat\r\ndifferent because, as we all know, there are always more\r\nwomen present to deal with social items than with other\r\nitems. But during the general debate there were very few\r\nwomen in the Hall. Then this thought came to mind: would\r\nthis not be the right time, when we have asked the\r\nSecretariat of the United Nations to gradually incorporate\r\nmore women into managerial and other posts, for us to do\r\nthe same ourselves — we, the Governments. I will leave\r\nthe Assembly with this idea: we should agree, through a\r\nresolution, to appeal to our own Governments to\r\nincorporate into their delegations to the United Nations a\r\nhigher percentage of women. We, the Governments, must\r\nbe able to lead by example.\r\nFinally, I mentioned at the beginning of my\r\nstatement that we were living in a world of human\r\nindifference. However, we all know that there is a part of\r\nus that needs to act on the basis of values, ideals and\r\ndreams. We know that we are not heartless robots and\r\nthat feelings and affection are an important part of our\r\nhuman identity. The Social Summit was a modern,\r\ncontemporary, realistic and practical effort to take a\r\nhuman look at things and to overcome the moral\r\nindifference of our times. I invite all present to keep the\r\nspirit of Copenhagen alive in ourselves and in the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Hoey (Ireland): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The following associated\r\ncountries, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovenia and Slovakia, align themselves with this\r\nstatement. Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway have also\r\naligned themselves with this statement.\r\nThe gathering of world leaders in Copenhagen in\r\nMarch last year marked a new consensus among the\r\ninternational community on the issue of development. It\r\nprovided that economic development, social development\r\nand environmental protection are interdependent and\r\nmutually reinforcing components of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It agreed to place renewed emphasis on\r\npeople at the centre of development, to underline that the\r\nmain purpose of development is to benefit the individual,\r\nand that development policies must be directed to\r\nachieving this aim. It agreed to give the goals of social\r\ndevelopment and human well-being\r\n“the highest priority both now and into the twenty-\r\nfirst century” (A/CONF.166/9, p. 5, para. 1)\r\nand provided for a global and integrated approach to\r\nsocial development.\r\nOver the last 50 years, there has been an enormous\r\nincrease in global wealth and, in most countries, people\r\nexpect to live longer, are better educated and have greater\r\naccess to health care and social services. Many\r\ndeveloping countries are participating more fully in the\r\nglobal economy and are playing an increasingly\r\nsignificant role in generating growth and expanding trade.\r\nYet the gap between the richest and poorest countries\r\ncontinues to widen. Within many countries, the benefits\r\nof economic growth and wealth are unevenly distributed,\r\nwith a disproportionate share going to the wealthiest.\r\nNearly 1.3 billion people around the world live in\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nabsolute poverty, and their number is growing at the rate of\r\nalmost 25 million a year. Over 120 million people are\r\nunemployed, many of them for long periods of time.\r\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms continue to be\r\nviolated, despite the solemn commitments entered into at\r\nthe World Conference on Human Rights. Discrimination\r\nflourishes, whether the motive be gender, race, religion,\r\nethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability or any other\r\ngrounds.\r\nThe Heads of State and Government gathered at\r\nCopenhagen entered into a series of far-reaching\r\ncommitments designed to address and overcome these\r\nchallenges. They emphasized that development is not solely\r\na question of economic growth. It encompasses also the\r\nlegal and constitutional frameworks of States. It requires\r\ndemocratic and open governance in which government is\r\naccountable to the people and the individual is empowered\r\nand can participate fully in decision-making at all levels. It\r\nalso requires social justice and the equitable distribution of\r\nwealth and income.\r\nDevelopment also demands full respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, and their enjoyment by\r\nall. It cannot be achieved unless women enjoy in law and\r\npractice full equality with men, and are able to participate\r\nfully in all aspects of society, and to obtain equal benefit\r\nfrom development. It cannot be achieved, either, if society\r\ndiscriminates against any of its members on any ground. On\r\nthe contrary, the abilities, talents and experiences of all\r\npeople, including the young and the old as well as people\r\nwith disabilities, should be recognized, promoted and used\r\nin working towards a society for all.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration recognizes that the\r\nformulation and implementation of strategies, policies,\r\nprogrammes and actions for social development are the\r\nresponsibility of each country. In so doing, Governments\r\nmay take into account the particular conditions that each\r\nfaces. Indeed, given the diversity of situations around the\r\nworld, and the complexity and interdependence of the\r\nfactors affecting social development, there is no single\r\nstrategy which is universally applicable. However, the need\r\nto take account of differing conditions and to apply the\r\nstrategy that is best suited to meet them cannot be used as\r\na pretext to avoid or circumvent the commitments freely\r\nundertaken by Governments at the Social Summit and the\r\ninternational conferences.\r\nThe Programme of Action is very clear in this regard.\r\nIt proclaims that the ultimate goal of social development is\r\nto improve and enhance the quality of life of all people. It\r\nsets out numerous actions that must be undertaken to this\r\nend. Among others, the achievement of this aim requires\r\ndemocratic institutions, increased and equal opportunities,\r\nthe rule of law, the promotion of respect for cultural\r\ndiversity and respect for all human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, including the rights of persons belonging to\r\nminorities. All these commitments, and the others\r\nadopted, must be implemented in their entirety.\r\nGovernments cannot excuse a failure to fulfil one aspect\r\nby pleading the inability to achieve another. They cannot\r\nadduce lack of development as a reason for denying the\r\nfull equality of women, or for denying the rights of\r\nminorities or indigenous people. Equally, they cannot\r\npoint to achievements in one area as a mitigating reason\r\nfor neglecting another. A democratic system, respect for\r\ncivil and political rights, and free and fair elections do not\r\npermit Governments to ignore social and economic\r\ndeprivation and exclusion from society.\r\nThe eradication of poverty is the most daunting\r\nsocial challenge facing national Governments and the\r\ninternational community today, when more than one\r\nperson in five lives in absolute poverty, and many more\r\nhave unacceptably low standards of living. Poverty is a\r\ncomplex and multidimensional problem which has its\r\nroots in structural, institutional and developmental causes\r\nat both the national and international levels. It is often\r\naccompanied by lack of participation in civil and political\r\nlife. The economic and social problems faced by people\r\nliving in poverty are exacerbated by their exclusion from\r\ndecision-making and the fact that their views are\r\nfrequently ignored by those in positions of authority.\r\nAchieving the goal of the eradication of poverty\r\nrequires that Government and society address all aspects\r\nof the problem. It may be necessary to alter the economic\r\nand administrative systems so that everyone can have\r\naccess to resources and opportunities. Ensuring that all\r\ncan benefit from sustainable economic growth may\r\nrequire far-reaching changes in the way wealth and\r\nincome are distributed. Measures must be taken to ensure\r\nthe democratic participation of people living in poverty,\r\nincluding participation in the design and implementation\r\nof anti-poverty programmes. It is also necessary to\r\nprovide social protection programmes for those who\r\ncannot support themselves. A gender perspective must be\r\nintegrated fully into all aspects of the design and\r\nexecution of strategies and programmes to combat\r\npoverty. Indeed, since the majority of those living in\r\npoverty are women, any anti-poverty programme that fails\r\nto mainstream a gender perspective will fail in its\r\nobjectives.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nThis was what we agreed at Copenhagen. It is time to\r\nput these commitments into effect. Governments agreed to\r\nformulate or strengthen, preferably by 1996, and implement\r\nnational poverty eradication plans to address the structural\r\ncauses of poverty. These national plans should establish\r\nstrategies and goals for the substantial reduction of overall\r\npoverty and the eradication of absolute poverty. Each\r\ncountry should also develop a precise definition and\r\nassessment of absolute poverty. Many Governments,\r\nincluding Governments within the European Union, are\r\nengaged in activities aimed at developing these national\r\nanti-poverty strategies as well as supporting developing\r\ncountries in the design and implementation of these\r\nstrategies. It is essential that Governments fully involve\r\ncivil society in the development and implementation of\r\nthese strategies. This participation should extend to all those\r\nwith an interest in the outcome, and particularly\r\nrepresentatives of people living in poverty, as well as\r\nwomen, people with disabilities, youth and older persons.\r\nThe support of national poverty eradication plans is,\r\nin our view, the key task for the United Nations system and\r\nshould be implemented in an effective, coordinated and\r\naction-oriented manner. We appreciated the discussion of\r\nthe issue at the last session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, and we believe that the agreed conclusions\r\nconstitute solid ground for action by the Commission for\r\nSocial Development and the United Nations system as a\r\nwhole. The political commitment of the system needs to be\r\ncomplemented by an appropriate operational framework,\r\nparticularly at country level. Poverty eradication plans\r\nshould be incorporated fully into the various United Nations\r\nmechanisms to support Governments in their efforts to\r\nachieve sustainable social and economic development. For\r\nits part, the United Nations system, through the resident\r\ncoordinators, should provide support to Governments, where\r\nrequested, in the planning, formulation, implementation and\r\nmonitoring of these plans and programmes.\r\nThe European Union believes that the support of the\r\ninternational community at both the bilateral and\r\nmultilateral levels is essential in helping to create an\r\nenvironment in which Governments take the lead in\r\nassessing poverty situations and in developing national\r\npoverty eradication strategies and programmes, and we will\r\nplay our part in such efforts. The effective mobilization of\r\nfinancial resources for poverty eradication and a more\r\neffective orientation of development cooperation and\r\nassistance to this goal need to be fully explored, bearing in\r\nmind our commitment to the 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct as the target for official development assistance.\r\nWe also note the work that interested countries have\r\nundertaken in developing the 20/20 concept, notably at\r\nmeetings that led to the adoption of the Oslo consensus.\r\nWe look forward to the follow-up meeting next year,\r\nwhich will review and assess progress in implementing\r\nthis initiative.\r\nThe Programme of Action identified full and\r\nadequately remunerated employment as an effective\r\nmethod of combating poverty and promoting social\r\nintegration. The goal of full employment requires that the\r\nState, the social partners and all the other members of\r\ncivil society at all levels cooperate to create conditions\r\nthat enable everyone to participate in and benefit from\r\nproductive work. It is essential to place the creation of\r\nemployment at the centre of national strategies and\r\npolicies. Particular attention should be paid to the\r\nenhancement of employment and the need for quality\r\njobs, with full respect for the rights of workers as defined\r\nin relevant international instruments, notably those agreed\r\nin the framework of the International Labour\r\nOrganization.\r\nParticular efforts are required to ensure gender\r\nequality, equal opportunity and non-discrimination.\r\nSpecial priority must be given to the problems of\r\ns t ruc tu ra l , l ong- t e rm unemploymen t and\r\nunderemployment. Priority should also be given to\r\nensuring productive employment for youth, women,\r\npersons with disabilities, and disadvantaged groups and\r\nindividuals. Education and training programmes assume\r\na particular importance in providing individuals with the\r\nnecessary skills and qualifications to avail themselves of\r\nopportunities for full and productive employment.\r\nNext year, the Commission for Social Development\r\nwill examine the theme of “Productive employment and\r\nsustainable livelihoods”. We look forward to a focused\r\nand pragmatic discussion of the various issues involved.\r\nThis will require thorough preparation by the Secretariat,\r\nand the active participation of Governments, the social\r\npartners and those elements of the United Nations system\r\nwith particular responsibilities in this area. The input and\r\nparticipation of the International Labour Organization in\r\nthis discussion will be particularly valuable.\r\nUnemployment within the European Union remains\r\na matter of great concern. While the conditions for\r\neconomic recovery in Europe are in place, the rate of\r\nunemployment remains unacceptably high, and the fight\r\nfor employment remains the top priority of the European\r\nUnion and its member States. The European Council,\r\nmeeting in Florence last June, had a detailed discussion\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nof growth and employment, and stressed that new impetus\r\nwas to be given to job creation strategies and to their\r\nimplementation. Sustainable employment creation requires\r\nan approach which involves macro-economic stability,\r\nstructural reform in the functioning of labour, product and\r\nservices markets, and a wide range of labour-market\r\npolicies designed to help the labour categories particularly\r\nhit by unemployment. These include the long-term\r\nunemployed and, in most countries, women, young people\r\nand the unskilled. The issue of employment is an important\r\nquestion in the context of the intergovernmental conference\r\nat present under way to review the operation of the treaties\r\nand to prepare reforms of the Union’s institutions.\r\nThe aim of social integration is to create a “society for\r\nall, in which every individual can participate fully”. Society\r\nmust be firmly rooted in the rule of law, democratic\r\nparticipation, gender equality, the full enjoyment of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms by all, social justice,\r\ntolerance, respect for ethnic, religious and cultural diversity,\r\nand meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs,\r\nsuch as young and older people, as well as people with\r\ndisabilities. Achieving this requires transparent and\r\naccountable public institutions that are accessible to people\r\non an equal basis and are responsive to their needs. It\r\nrequires action by Governments to enshrine in law the\r\nrights of the individual, and to ensure that effective action\r\nis taken in cases where these are not respected.\r\nStrengthened participation and involvement of civil society\r\nin the formulation, implementation and evaluation of\r\ndecisions determining the functioning and well-being of\r\nsocieties is also critical.\r\nThe European Union is composed of multicultural and\r\nmulti-ethnic societies. We are concerned about many\r\nserious incidents of racial or ethnic discrimination,\r\nintolerance, xenophobia and racially motivated violence,\r\nwhich continue to occur despite the efforts of Governments\r\nand law enforcement authorities to prevent them and to\r\nbring their perpetrators to justice. The European Union will\r\ncontinue to combat vigorously these incidents and all other\r\nforms of discrimination. In addition to actions undertaken\r\nat national level, we have launched a Union-wide effort to\r\ncombat these manifestations. At its meeting in Florence in\r\nJune, the European Council reaffirmed the Union’s\r\ndetermination to combat racism and xenophobia with the\r\nutmost resolve, and approved the principle underlying the\r\nestablishment of a European monitoring centre. The Union\r\nis currently taking steps to establish the centre and is\r\nconsidering the links between it and the Council of Europe.\r\nThe Council of Ministers is also considering other measures\r\nrelating to the laws and the judicial and administrative\r\nprocedures of member States in this field.\r\n1997 has been proclaimed the “European Year\r\nagainst Racism”. The aim is to highlight the threat posed\r\nby racism to human rights and fundamental freedoms, as\r\nwell as to the economic and social cohesion of the Union.\r\nThese objectives will be realized in close partnership with\r\nall elements of civil society, including non-governmental\r\norganizations and those affected by racism.\r\nThe World Summit on Social Development enabled\r\nthe international community to adopt a particular\r\nperspective in relation to development. But it did not take\r\nplace in isolation. It built upon the outcomes of earlier\r\nconferences, notably those of Rio de Janeiro, Vienna and\r\nCairo. In turn the commitments entered into in\r\nCopenhagen have been expanded further at Beijing, and\r\nwill continue to be built upon in future years as the\r\ninternational community continues its efforts to “promote\r\nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger\r\nfreedom” (A/CONF.166/9, p. 39, para. 17 (a)). As a\r\nresult, it is important that Governments and the United\r\nNations system implement these outcomes, and monitor\r\ntheir implementation, in an integrated manner. We fully\r\nshare the views expressed by Under-Secretary-General\r\nDesai when he addressed the Third Committee on\r\nMonday that the credibility of the policy-of-development\r\nprocess requires that there be a shift of focus to\r\nimplementation, and that the analytical, normative and\r\noperational work of the United Nations should\r\nincreasingly be guided by the objectives of integration\r\nand mainstreaming.\r\nLast year, the General Assembly adopted a three-\r\ntiered mechanism to ensure that the follow-up to the\r\nSocial Summit should take place in such an integrated\r\nmanner. It provided that the General Assembly should act\r\nas the principal policy-making organ on manners relating\r\nto the follow-up of the Summit. This role would be\r\nensured most effectively if this question were to be\r\nconsidered in those main committees which have the\r\nprimary responsibility for economic and social issues, as\r\nis the case of the follow-up to other major conferences.\r\nThe experience of this year, where we have had\r\nessentially the same debate in plenary and in the Third\r\nCommittee, should not be repeated. We are of the view\r\nthat our agenda and programme of work for future years\r\nshould take account of these concerns.\r\nImportant decisions were taken at this year’s session\r\nof the Economic and Social Council on coordination of\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nthe work of its functional commissions in relation to\r\npoverty eradication, one of the priority themes of the\r\nSummit. We trust that in future years, this coordinated\r\napproach will extend to other matters that were discussed\r\nat Copenhagen and other major United Nations conferences.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council also adopted a\r\nframework for the functioning of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development to enable it to fulfil its central role as\r\nthe functional commission with the primary responsibility\r\nfor the follow-up and review of the implementation of the\r\nSummit. It is important that the Commission receive the\r\nsupport of Governments in carrying out this task. In this\r\nregard, it is important to ensure the participation of high-\r\nlevel representatives from the field of social development\r\nin its work.\r\nIndeed, the need for such high-level involvement in\r\nthe follow-up and implementation of the Social Summit at\r\nboth national and international level is essential if we are to\r\nmaintain the necessary political will to turn the\r\ncommitments of Copenhagen into reality.\r\nMr. Owada (Japan): It is now almost one and a half\r\nyears since the World Summit for Social Development was\r\nheld in Copenhagen. The Copenhagen Summit was the\r\nculmination of a series of international conferences on\r\nsocial issues that the international community has to tackle\r\nin the contemporary world on a priority basis. The\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted at the\r\nSummit, containing an important set of commitments and\r\nrecommendations to be implemented, became a historic\r\nlandmark that established the international consensus on the\r\ngoals to be pursued and achieved in the area of social\r\ndevelopment for the coming decades.\r\nWith the demise of the cold war and the evolution of\r\nan environment characterized by ever-increasing\r\nglobalization and economic interdependence, the\r\ninternational community faces a new opportunity as well as\r\na new challenge for tackling the problem of development in\r\na new light. Some progress has been made in the right\r\ndirection in this regard, but much remains to be done. In\r\nthis context, the Copenhagen Summit should be looked at\r\nas a new attempt to address this most important problem of\r\ndevelopment from the angle of its social components.\r\nOne of the most important achievements of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit was the agreement to place people at\r\nthe centre of the development process. As noted in its\r\nProgramme of Action,\r\n“economic development, social development and\r\nenvironmental protection are interdependent and\r\nmutually reinforcing components of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, which is the framework for our efforts\r\nto achieve a higher quality of life for all people.”\r\n(A/CONF.166/9, p. 5, para. 6)\r\nThe Government of Japan believes that in order to realize\r\nthis, a new development strategy, to be pursued along this\r\nline, is very much needed, based on this concept of\r\npeople-centred development. We in Japan believe that\r\nsuch genuine development can only be achieved on the\r\nbasis of a comprehensive approach to development which\r\nwould involve activities ranging over the economic and\r\nsocial fields, such as financial resource mobilization\r\nthrough official development assistance, investment and\r\ntrade, and human resource mobilization through social\r\nintegration of people by means of ensuring basic\r\neducation, primary health care and empowerment of all\r\ngroups of people in society.\r\nIn any society, sound economic growth can be\r\nattained only in conjunction with sound progress in social\r\ndevelopment. With that clear recognition in mind, we\r\nhave to tackle the three basic issues on which the Summit\r\nchose to focus its attention — the eradication of poverty,\r\nthe expansion of productive employment and social\r\nintegration — as challenges to be tackled in unison on\r\nour way to the attainment of development based on social\r\njustice. The Declaration adopted by Heads of State or\r\nGovernment at the Summit recognizes that today more\r\nthan 1 billion people are living in absolute poverty, over\r\n120 million people are unemployed and a great number of\r\ncitizens are excluded from the social and political process.\r\nJapan maintains the view that these three basic issues are\r\nclosely interrelated. If we cannot succeed in coping\r\neffectively with one issue, it will adversely affect the\r\nsolution of the other two, with the result that none of\r\nthem will be solved. Each country needs to formulate and\r\nimplement comprehensive and effective policies based on\r\nthe clear recognition of this interrelationship.\r\nAn essential step towards moving in that direction is\r\nto ensure the participation of people, Governments and\r\nother actors of civil society in carrying out the\r\ncommitments agreed upon in the Programme of Action on\r\nthe basis of this integrated approach. This would include\r\nsetting up such targets as universal access to basic\r\neducation, a reduction in the infant mortality rate, a\r\nreduction in malnutrition among children and the\r\nattainment by all people of a higher level of health.\r\nEfforts to achieve these targets by the countries in the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nprocess of development need to be complemented by well-\r\ncoordinated assistance from developed countries,\r\ninternational organizations, the private sector and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. It is with a keen awareness of\r\nthis point that Japan has undertaken its initiative for\r\npromoting a new strategy for development and has, for its\r\npart, been implementing such an integrated approach in its\r\ndevelopment cooperation policy.\r\nAt this juncture in our consideration of the issues\r\ninvolved in social development, I wish to emphasize the\r\nimportance of one of the three basic themes of the Summit:\r\nsocial integration. The achievement of social integration is\r\nnot only important from the viewpoint that each citizen\r\nshould be given the opportunity to make the most of his or\r\nher potential; it is also important from the viewpoint that\r\nthe participation of citizens, who have an indispensable role\r\nto play in following up this Summit, is essential to\r\nachieving the goal of development.\r\nThe commitments and recommendations agreed upon\r\nat Copenhagen, contained in the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action, will have to be implemented on the\r\ninternational level as well as on the national level. It is in\r\nthis context that the proposal to achieve and maintain the\r\n20/20 initiative has its significance. Thus, Japan allocated\r\n23.2 per cent of its bilateral assistance in 1994 to projects\r\nrelated to social infrastructure such as education, public\r\nhealth, sanitation and population, while 33.3 per cent went\r\nto meet basic human needs, including projects in the social\r\nand agricultural sectors and the area of emergency relief.\r\nThe share of the social sector in Japanese official\r\ndevelopment assistance has grown steadily in recent years,\r\nand Japan intends to further intensify its cooperation in this\r\narea.\r\nThe promotion of social integration requires active\r\nparticipation by local communities in the development\r\nprocess and activities at the grass-roots level. As part of its\r\nefforts in these areas, Japan is offering assistance to\r\nactivities of non-governmental organizations and local\r\ngovernments. Furthermore, in order to encourage the\r\nintegration into society of disadvantaged people, Japan is\r\nactively engaged in providing assistance to developing\r\ncountries in support of persons with disabilities, the elderly\r\nand minorities. Japan is also extending cooperation for the\r\nempowerment of women and for child health care. My\r\ndelegation urges other Governments to work in the same\r\ndirection to meet our promise at the international level.\r\nAs regards the organizational side of our work for the\r\nimplementation of what was agreed upon at Copenhagen,\r\nmy delegation notes with satisfaction that the General\r\nAssembly last year began its consideration of ways and\r\nmeans for the United Nations system to follow up the\r\nCopenhagen Summit. Let me offer the views of my\r\ndelegation on how these follow-up activities should be\r\ncarried out at the international level, primarily within the\r\nUnited Nations system, and on what part of this process\r\nwe must place our primary emphasis.\r\nMy delegation is gratified to see that the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nCommission for Social Development, a three-tiered\r\nmechanism for the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nSummit, have begun their work in their respective roles,\r\nin accordance with the mandates conferred on them by\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 50/161. As regards the role\r\nof the Commission for Social Development, Japan\r\nwelcomes the adoption of Economic and Social Council\r\nresolution 1996/7 at the Council’s substantive session this\r\nyear. The Commission, as part of its existing mandate, is\r\nto assist the Council in monitoring, reviewing and\r\nappraising the progress achieved and problems\r\nencountered in the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction. The resolution also establishes further substantive\r\nagenda items for the Commission, as well as its\r\nprogramme of work and the methods to be employed in\r\ncarrying it out. My delegation is fully convinced that all\r\nthese new procedural arrangements will enhance the\r\ncapacity of the Commission and revitalize its functions as\r\nthe key intergovernmental institution engaged in\r\nmonitoring, promoting and guiding the follow-up to the\r\nSocial Summit at the global level.\r\nThe role of the Economic and Social Council in the\r\nfollow-up activities of the Social Summit must be to\r\nprovide overall guidance, maintain system-wide\r\ncoordination and review the progress made towards\r\nimplementing the outcome of the Summit. In carrying out\r\nthis task, it is imperative that the whole structure of the\r\nUnited Nations, including the roles and functions of the\r\nCouncil and the organization of the Secretariat in the\r\neconomic and social fields, should be reviewed and\r\nreformed with a view to meeting the new requirements\r\nand expectations of contemporary international society.\r\nAs for the role of the General Assembly in this area,\r\nthe Assembly, as the highest decision-making organ\r\nwithin the United Nations, should strengthen its policy-\r\nmaking role on social development in the\r\nintergovernmental process and provide policy guidance to\r\nall relevant organs and bodies.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nOther agencies and institutions in the United Nations\r\nsystem, working in the field of social development, should\r\nalso be brought into this more integrated scheme of\r\ncooperation. In this connection, the delegation of Japan\r\nnotes with satisfaction that the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) has responded to the request of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in a timely manner, particularly by\r\nreorienting its programming activities to target poverty\r\neradication as its paramount concern.\r\nThe active participation of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions in the follow-up process is likewise essential. It\r\nis hoped that these institutions will pay much attention to\r\nthe importance of social factors in the overall strategy for\r\ndevelopment and strengthen their efforts in that area.\r\nIntensified cooperation on their part with the United\r\nNations system at the global, regional and national levels in\r\nthe area of economic and social development would be\r\nmost desirable to ensure coherent development efforts to\r\nproduce fruitful results.\r\nIn order to effect such an integrated scheme of\r\ncooperation along the lines I have just outlined, my\r\ndelegation believes that the institution of inter-agency task\r\nforces, as established by the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination, can be a major channel through which\r\nparticipating agencies can engage in constructive dialogue\r\nfor the purpose of ensuring close cooperation in effectively\r\nimplementing the Programme of Action. Intensified efforts\r\nfor coordination and cooperation are very much desired.\r\nIn the year 2000, the United Nations is scheduled to\r\nconduct an overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Social Summit.\r\nTowards that goal, the United Nations system, other\r\ninternational organizations, Governments and the relevant\r\nactors in civil society must work together to move forward\r\nin a spirit of cooperation and partnership. Japan, for its part,\r\nwill be actively engaged in this process by promoting the\r\nnew strategy for development, of which the task assigned\r\nto us in the Programme of Action for social development\r\nshould form an integral part.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): A short while ago, the\r\nrepresentative of the European Union spoke on behalf of\r\nthe European Union and associated countries, including\r\nSlovenia. The purpose of my statement is to add a few\r\nadditional points to the statement made on behalf of our\r\ndelegation.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development was an\r\nimportant conference, and its outcome represents one of the\r\nmost far-reaching programmes ever adopted within the\r\nframework of the United Nations. Let me recall in this\r\ncontext that Ambassador Somavía of Chile, in his\r\nstatement earlier this morning, spoke about the great\r\ninternational consensus formulated at Copenhagen. The\r\nSummit articulated, in a systematic and coherent manner,\r\na set of basic and very demanding commitments and an\r\nambitious Programme which has the potential to be a\r\nmajor contribution to the shaping of world economic and\r\nsocial policies in the decades to come.\r\nIt is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be\r\nthe international forum that enables the formulation and\r\nadoption, by the highest representatives of States, of such\r\nambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate\r\nabsolute poverty by a target date to be set by each\r\ncountry, or the pursuit of the objective of full\r\nemployment and the protection of social integration based\r\non the enhancement and protection of human rights for\r\nall. These are ambitious commitments and the\r\nachievement of practical results will require time. It is\r\nimportant to keep in mind the long-term nature of this\r\nvision and the Programme adopted at Copenhagen.\r\nHowever, the effort to give concrete form to\r\ncommitments adopted at the Summit must be continuous\r\nand result-oriented. The implementation process will\r\npreserve its credibility only if the first results are seen\r\nsoon and if the continuity of a result-oriented approach is\r\npreserved.\r\nTwo basic conditions have to be met in order to\r\nmake the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development successful. The first is\r\nessentially ethical, in our opinion, while the second is\r\npractical and essentially political. The first condition\r\nrelates to the actual readiness of decision-makers, both at\r\nthe national and the international levels, to take their\r\ncommitments seriously. The second requires careful\r\npolicy-making and appropriate institutional support. These\r\ntwo conditions are closely interrelated: without an ethical\r\ncomponent, there is very little hope for genuine success\r\nin policy-making, while without effective policy-making\r\neven a genuine ethical commitment remains empty.\r\nSlovenia takes the ethical aspect of implementing the\r\ncommitments of the world social Summit very seriously.\r\nOur experience, like that of many other States, is that in\r\npractical reality difficult policy choices need to be made.\r\nThus, in situations when choices are required, the\r\ncommitments adopted at the world social Summit must\r\nnot be neglected. Moreover, it is precisely in situations\r\nrequiring difficult choices that the objectives,\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ncommitments and Programme of Action adopted in\r\nCopenhagen can be given specific meaning, despite various\r\nobstacles which limit the leeway of decision makers.\r\nThe objectives and commitments of the world social\r\nSummit can be inconvenient in practice, or can conflict\r\nwith other priorities at the local, regional and international\r\nlevels. It is therefore necessary that special efforts be made\r\nin implementation, in particular in the first years, in order\r\nto prove the viability of the outcome of the Summit.\r\nThe second basic condition relates to policy-making.\r\nHere, both persistence and imagination are required from\r\npolicy makers. For Governments, the question of how to\r\ninvolve the increasingly important non-State actors and civil\r\nsociety in a meaningful way, and without creating a\r\nrelationship of subordination, poses one of the major\r\nchallenges for the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nworld social Summit.\r\nThe most important part of policy-making has to take\r\nplace at the local and national levels. United Nations\r\nMember States bear the primary responsibility for their\r\npolicies in the field of social development and for the\r\nresults of such policies. Activities at the international level\r\nare a supplement — sometimes an essential one — to the\r\nactivities of Governments at the national level.\r\nAs we read the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\noutcome of the world social Summit (A/51/348) in the light\r\nof these basic ethical and policy requirements, we can\r\ndiscern important elements of progress. Let me mention, by\r\nway of illustration, only two among them. I shall select two\r\nthat are not necessarily always the focus of our attention.\r\nIt is clear that any serious effort for measuring actual\r\nprogress in the implementation of the outcome of the world\r\nsocial Summit requires appropriate methodology. In\r\nparticular, it requires a set of adequate and internationally-\r\naccepted statistical indicators to measure actual progress\r\nand agreed-upon methodology to use them. It is therefore\r\nvery important that — as we learn from the report of the\r\nSecretary-General — serious initiatives have already been\r\ntaken in this domain.\r\nWe learn in the report about the statistical project\r\nlaunched by the Government of Denmark, the host country\r\nof the world social Summit. We entirely agree with the\r\nGovernment of Denmark that:\r\n“better statistics are essential for a meaningful\r\ndebate on the solutions to social problems”.\r\n(A/51/348, para. 17)\r\nThis approach demonstrates the high level of\r\ncommitment of the Government of the Summit’s host\r\ncountry to making a major and very meaningful\r\ncontribution to the implementation of the programmes\r\nadopted at Copenhagen. What is required at the level of\r\nthe United Nations is not only recognition but also\r\neffective support for the Government of Denmark for the\r\nsuccess of its statistical project.\r\nIn this context, we find it encouraging that a related\r\ndevelopment has taken place in the United Nations\r\nStatistical Commission. In paragraph 42 of the report of\r\nthe Secretary- General, we read that the Commission has\r\nalready established an Expert Group on the Statistical\r\nImplications of Recent Major United Nations Conferences\r\nto draw up a work programme reflecting the major action\r\nareas identified by the Summit and indicators where\r\ninternational statistical work in the social field should be\r\nconcentrated. We learn from the same paragraph that the\r\nExpert Group has already reached agreement — and I\r\nemphasize, has already reached agreement — on a core\r\nlist of 15 specific indicators comprising a minimum\r\nspecial data set to be collected by each country. These\r\nindicators were recommended to the Commission for its\r\nendorsement, and we hope that the Commission will\r\nagree on them soon.\r\nThese developments in the field of statistics should\r\nbe encouraged and should converge. There is a need for\r\nboth methodological improvement and stronger\r\ninternational agreement on indicators, and I would\r\nespecially emphasize the need for stronger international\r\nagreement on the indicators to be used to measure social\r\nprogress, in the future, in a coherent and universally\r\napplicable manner. The level of knowledge about the\r\nactual situation, the actual progress or regression, must be\r\nimproved in order to enable the decision-making bodies\r\nof the United Nations and of Governments to promote\r\ncompetent and successful policy-making.\r\nThe critical importance of such a seemingly\r\ntechnical aspect as statistics for successful policy-making\r\nreminds us that we need to understand more completely\r\nthe social phenomena we are dealing with in the context\r\nof the follow-up to the Copenhagen Summit in order to\r\ndevelop appropriate policies. The task of eradicating\r\npoverty requires a better understanding of the structural\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ncauses of poverty, some of which are specific to a given\r\nsociety while others may result from global factors.\r\nThe acceptance of poverty as a social reality has in the\r\npast created a specific cultural effect which continues to\r\npersist, an effect that some commentators call the culture of\r\npoverty, which is based on the belief that the problem is\r\ntoo large and that the situation cannot really be changed.\r\nThat belief is still strong worldwide. The commitment to\r\neradicate poverty adopted at Copenhagen is an important\r\nconceptual challenge to that belief. However, that challenge\r\nis only a beginning which may or may not lead to effective\r\npolicy.\r\nWe are encouraged to see that in the context of\r\npreparations for the first United Nations Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty, which will start in 1997, a\r\nconceptually sound policy approach is emerging. It insists\r\non income-generating activities by the affected people\r\nthemselves and on support through the delivery of basic\r\nsocial services and social safety nets.\r\nHowever, the conceptual soundness of the emerging\r\nUnited Nations approach to the eradication of poverty has\r\nto be tested in the context of actual policies and has to\r\nyield measurable results in terms of attaining the targets set\r\nat Copenhagen, narrowing the income gap within societies\r\nand between States and measurably empowering the people.\r\nIn this context it is particularly important to put the gender\r\nissue at the centre of analysis of the problems to be\r\naddressed and of the policy-making. The experience gained\r\nin a variety of social settings worldwide has confirmed the\r\nprimary importance of the empowerment of women and the\r\nprimary need to develop appropriate policy approaches to\r\naddress this issue.\r\nIn this way, the agenda of implementing the central\r\ncommitment adopted at Copenhagen — the commitment\r\nto eradicate poverty — becomes very diverse and\r\ndemanding; it is an agenda that will require a great deal\r\nof energy and persistence in its implementation.\r\nLet me say in conclusion that it is important that the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development be followed closely and continuously\r\nby the General Assembly. We would therefore favour\r\nregular reports by the Secretary-General and regular\r\nconsideration of this item by the General Assembly.\r\nAgenda item 119 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/51/366/Add.4)\r\nThe Acting President: Before calling the next\r\nspeaker, I should like to inform the Assembly that since\r\nthe issuance of the provisional version of document\r\nA/51/366/Add.4, I have been informed that Chad has also\r\nmade the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below\r\nthe amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter. May I\r\ntake it that the General Assembly duly takes note of this\r\ninformation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: This information will be\r\nincorporated into the final version of addendum 4.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
