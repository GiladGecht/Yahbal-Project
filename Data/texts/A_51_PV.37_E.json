(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 45 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/348)\r\nMrs. Gittens-Joseph (Trinidad and Tobago): In\r\nMarch 1995, over 100 Heads of State or Government\r\nattended the World Summit for Social Development at\r\nCopenhagen, affirming the importance of this issue as an\r\nitem of the highest priority on the international agenda and\r\ntheir determination to deal decisively with the challenge of\r\nachieving social progress for all. The Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration on Social Development and Programme of\r\nAction represents a comprehensive blueprint to secure this\r\ngoal.\r\nThis decision to devote plenary meetings to this\r\nagenda item at both the fiftieth and the fifty-first sessions\r\nof the General Assembly is indicative of the general desire\r\nto maintain the momentum produced by the landmark\r\nCopenhagen conference and to translate the commitments\r\nmade into concrete action. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development (A/51/348) provides useful\r\ninformation in assessing the follow-up to the Summit.\r\nLast December, the General Assembly, in resolution\r\n50/161, reaffirmed the critical importance of national action\r\nand international cooperation for social development. The\r\nAssembly stressed the need to invest in people and their\r\nwell-being in order to achieve the objectives of social\r\ndevelopment. It reiterated the call on Governments to\r\ndefine time-bound goals and targets for reducing poverty\r\nand eradicating absolute poverty, expanding employment\r\nand reducing unemployment and enhancing social\r\nintegration within each national context.\r\nThe World Bank estimates that about 1.5 billion\r\npeople live in absolute poverty today, most of them in\r\ndeveloping countries, and that the number is increasing by\r\napproximately 25 million a year. Poverty has been\r\nbrought into greater focus this year as it is the\r\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty. The\r\nstruggle against poverty is a struggle for human dignity.\r\nThe situation of a people driven by misery and\r\ndesperation provokes social instability and threatens peace\r\nand security.\r\nIt has been recognized that the struggle against\r\npoverty and for the promotion of social development need\r\nto be pursued jointly by developed and developing\r\ncountries, and that it is mutually beneficial to both. In this\r\nrespect, my delegation wishes to express its appreciation\r\nto the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for\r\nthe meeting held at Oslo last April to review the\r\nimplementation of the 20/20 initiative, which was\r\nenunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action, and\r\nwhich aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery\r\nof basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the\r\ndeveloping world through a partnership between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nThe mobilization of financial resources is critical in\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, and the Oslo consensus on the\r\n20/20 initiative is important. In this regard, there needs to\r\nbe a sustained and active effort to generate funds and\r\nprovide financial assistance, which are essential if we are\r\nto realize the commitments made at Copenhagen.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the actions taken so far by\r\nthe United Nations as a follow-up to the Summit. The\r\nCommission for Social Development, which has primary\r\nresponsibility for the follow-up to the Summit, decided at\r\nits special session in May that its work programme for the\r\nyears 1997 to 2000 will be geared towards implementation\r\nof the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action\r\non a thematic basis. Consideration of the special theme of\r\npoverty at the May meeting was timely, and the measures\r\nproposed for its eradication would be useful for follow-up\r\nwork at the national and international levels. The increase\r\nin membership of the Commission and the decision that at\r\nfuture sessions panels of experts will participate in\r\naddressing critical areas of concern will greatly assist the\r\nCommission in fulfilling its mandate.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council held a fruitful\r\nsession in July to look at coordination of the activities of\r\nthe United Nations system for the eradication of poverty.\r\nThe decision by the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination to establish inter-agency task forces will\r\nenhance the coordination required at the operational level\r\nin the United Nations system to provide support to\r\nGovernments and national institutions for implementation\r\nof the outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and other recent United Nations conferences.\r\nRegional commissions are also expected to play a key\r\nrole; the Economic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC) has assisted and participated in follow-\r\nup meetings in the region, notably the Summit Meeting of\r\nSocial Welfare Ministers from the Rio Group held at\r\nBuenos Aires in May 1995 and the regional technical\r\nfollow-up meeting on the agreements reached at the Social\r\nSummit held in Quito in November 1995. ECLAC also\r\nassisted in the organization of the Hemispheric Conference\r\non the Eradication of Poverty and Discrimination, which\r\nwas held in Santiago in January 1996. In response to the\r\nSummit’s call for the convening of regional meetings on a\r\nbiennial basis at a high political level to review the progress\r\nmade towards fulfilling the outcome of the Summit, the\r\nGovernment of Brazil has kindly agreed to host such a\r\nmeeting in São Paulo in March 1997.\r\nAt the subregional level, the Heads of Government\r\nof the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) at their\r\nsixteenth summit conference, in July 1995, urged member\r\nStates to conduct national consultations and asked the\r\nCARICOM secretariat to prepare a Caribbean policy\r\nposition on social development based on the outcome of\r\nthese consultations. It is hoped that such a policy will be\r\nready for the regional economic and social conference\r\nproposed for next year. A Caribbean ministerial meeting\r\non poverty eradication will be held in Port-of-Spain from\r\n28 October to 1 November 1996 with the assistance of\r\nthe ECLAC subregional headquarters in Port-of-Spain.\r\nAddressing the causes of poverty is high on the\r\ndevelopment agenda of the Government of Trinidad and\r\nTobago because of the increase in poverty levels and a\r\nshift in the character of poverty to encompass the\r\nphenomenon of the “new poor”, most of whom have been\r\nvictims of structural adjustment policies of the past\r\ndecade. Trinidad and Tobago has always shown a\r\ncommitment to the provision of a social safety net, but\r\nthe Government is attempting to approach the problem in\r\na more holistic manner through an integrated and\r\nmultisectoral strategy. The focus is not only on supportive\r\nand remedial measures, but also addresses the\r\nrehabilitative and developmental aspects necessary for\r\neliminating the root causes of poverty. The objective is to\r\nenable the poor to move out of their predicament and to\r\nenjoy sustainable livelihoods. This requires collaboration\r\nwith all sectors of the national community.\r\nA Change Management Unit for Poverty Eradication\r\nand Equity Building is being established, and the\r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago has obtained the\r\nsupport of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) in this endeavour. The Unit is expected to give\r\npermanence to and ensure the continuation of the\r\nGovernment’s efforts at poverty eradication and a general\r\nimprovement in the quality of life of its citizens. It will\r\ncreate an enabling environment to facilitate national\r\ndialogue on the development of an intersectoral approach\r\nto poverty-eradication policies in order to promote\r\nconsensus-building and practical approaches to\r\ncollaborative planning. It is envisaged that the Change\r\nManagement Unit will strengthen the capacity for\r\nplanning, management, implementation and monitoring\r\npoverty eradication strategies, including the development\r\nof national goals and targets.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago has also\r\ndecided to establish a National Social Development\r\nCouncil under the chairmanship of a senior cabinet\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nminister; the Council will be launched on 24 October,\r\nUnited Nations Day. The National Social Development\r\nCouncil will oversee national action as a follow-up to the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action emanating from the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and to the outcome\r\nof related international conferences. The Council will\r\noperate at the ministerial and technical levels, and the\r\nChange Management Unit for Poverty Eradication and\r\nEquity Building will serve as its Secretariat. The Council\r\nwill address the issues of poverty eradication, the expansion\r\nof productive employment and the enhancement of social\r\nintegration.\r\nThe United Nations sustainable development matrix,\r\nwith appropriate adaptations, will be used, since this will\r\nfacilitate easier collaboration among ministries,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector. This\r\nexercise has begun through a joint UNDP/ECLAC project\r\nwhich will develop an interactive database for collating\r\nnational information on social development initiatives and\r\nneeds. In order to take into account the particular concerns\r\nof Trinidad and Tobago, the United Nations matrix has\r\nbeen adapted to include the problems facing young males\r\nin society and the emerging phenomenon of street children.\r\nThe project will involve the participation of civil society,\r\nincluding the communities affected. It is hoped that this\r\nproject and indeed the efforts generally undertaken by\r\nTrinidad and Tobago to eradicate poverty and build social\r\nequity will continue to obtain tangible support from the\r\nUnited Nations system and relevant international agencies.\r\nSome 18 months ago, the international community was\r\nmobilized at the World Summit for Social Development to\r\nconfront the seemingly intractable problems of poverty and\r\nunemployment and there was great resolve to work\r\ncollectively to enhance social integration and social\r\ndevelopment where the well-being of the individual will be\r\nparamount. The commitments made in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration on Social Development and Programme of\r\nAction need to be implemented so that the social well-being\r\nof a significant segment of the world population will be\r\nimproved as we move apace to the twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The representative of Costa Rica has made a very\r\ngood statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nand I would like to lend my support to that statement.\r\nMany of the things that need to be said have already been\r\nsaid. What we need now is action. Therefore, my statement\r\nwill be very brief.\r\nIn the year and a half since the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, many countries have made great\r\nefforts in implementing the outcome of the Summit at the\r\nnational level by designating national focal points,\r\nformulating short-, medium- and long-term strategies and\r\nplans for social development and starting to take\r\nappropriate and concrete measures to implement them.\r\nThis is indeed commendable.\r\nHowever, we have also noted with concern that there\r\nare more words than substance in some of the actions\r\ntaken by relevant bodies of the United Nations and that\r\nthere is very little substantive cooperation at the\r\ninternational level. This trend must be reversed.\r\nConcrete goals for social development were set at\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development. To attain\r\nthese goals, all countries have made a commitment to\r\ncooperate at the international level. The Declaration of the\r\nSummit clearly states that:\r\n“these goals cannot be achieved by States alone. The\r\ninternational community, the United Nations, [and]\r\nthe multilateral financial institutions ... need to\r\npositively contribute their own share of efforts and\r\nresources”. (A/CONF.166/9, para. 27)\r\nIn order to accelerate international cooperation, we\r\ndeem it essential to stress the following requirements.\r\nFirst, top priority should be given to the eradication of\r\npoverty. Poverty eradication was one of the three\r\nfundamental issues at the Summit and is a primary task\r\nfacing many nations. It is absolutely unacceptable that\r\nsome one fifth of humankind should live in abject\r\npoverty, most of them suffering from hunger every day.\r\nA commitment was made at the Summit to achieve the\r\ngoal of eradicating poverty through prompt action. Now\r\nwe need to see whether the international community,\r\nparticularly the multilateral financial institutions, are ready\r\nto take action in this regard.\r\nSecondly, the mobilization of resources is of key\r\nimportance. The eradication of poverty, expansion of\r\nproductive employment and enhancement of social\r\nintegration all need resources as their material basis.\r\nMobilizing resources is therefore a core issue in the\r\nfollow-up to the Summit. Commitments were made at the\r\nSummit to:\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\n“mobilize new and additional financial resources that\r\nare both adequate and predictable and are mobilized in\r\na way that maximizes the availability of such\r\nresources” (A/CONF.166/9, Commitment 9 (i)),\r\nand to fulfil as soon as possible the agreed target of\r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official\r\ndevelopment assistance. The world is still waiting to see if\r\nthe developed countries will honour these commitments.\r\nThirdly, the United Nations should play a central\r\ncoordinating role. Such coordination could focus on\r\nensuring unified and comprehensive implementation and\r\nappraisal of the outcome of the Summit and other important\r\ninternational conferences related to social development, and\r\nparticularly on mobilizing financial resources. Solid\r\nprogress by the United Nations in this regard will be its\r\nmost valuable contribution to implementation of the\r\noutcome of the Summit.\r\nI should like now to brief the Assembly on China’s\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has formulated its Ninth Five-Year Plan for\r\nNational Economic and Social Development and an Outline\r\nof Long-Range Objectives to the Year 2000. In formulating\r\nthis plan and outline, China has taken full account of the\r\nrequirements of the Summit. China is determined basically\r\nto solve the problem, and has helped 200 million people\r\nbreak the cycle of poverty. This is a remarkable\r\nachievement by any standard in the world. We are also\r\ndetermined basically to solve the problem of food and\r\nclothing for 65 million people who are currently living in\r\na state of poverty. We will continue to expand employment\r\nto reduce the number of people unemployed or awaiting\r\nemployment to a minimum. We are determined to create 40\r\nmillion new jobs. We are committed to raising living\r\nstandard and will try to ensure the availability of nine-year\r\ncompulsory education in the next decade, reduce or\r\neliminate illiteracy among young people and ensure full and\r\ncomprehensive progress and development. We will also\r\nstress environmental protection, ecology and natural\r\nresources.\r\nChina will, as always, support and cooperate with the\r\nUnited Nations in its efforts in the area of social\r\ndevelopment and take an active part in international\r\ncooperation in this field, thus making its contribution to the\r\npromotion of world social development.\r\nMr. Gorita (Romania): My country endorsed the\r\nstatement delivered today by the Irish delegation on behalf\r\nof the European Union, so I would just like to add some\r\nspecific comments.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development\r\nrepresented a landmark in development-related\r\ninternational cooperation. It created an unprecedented\r\nframework for a global social vision projected into the\r\ntwenty-first century based on the three core themes of the\r\nSummit: the elimination of poverty; employment; and\r\nsocial integration. It highlighted the need to complement\r\neconomic growth with social development and reflected\r\nimportant shifts in the post-cold-war international\r\napproach to security through its focus on human security\r\nand sustainable human development. Furthermore, it\r\nplaced emphasis on important principles and values such\r\nas responsibility and solidarity within and among nations\r\nand the idea of a new social contract, at the global level.\r\nThis generous and coherent vision gained tremendous\r\npolitical weight through the strong common commitment\r\nexpressed by States Members of the United Nations from\r\nthe rostrum of the Summit.\r\nThe full and effective implementation of the\r\ncommitments laid down in the Copenhagen Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action represents a challenge to\r\nGovernments, civil society and the international\r\ncommunity. Romania believes that Governments bear the\r\nprimary responsibility for working out and implementing\r\nsocial development policies. At the same time, all actors\r\nin civil society, including non-governmental organizations,\r\nshould participate actively in the attainment of these\r\ngoals. Likewise, the contributions made by the United\r\nNations and multilateral institutions represent an essential\r\nsupport to the national efforts.\r\nAs for the role of the United Nations in this area, I\r\nwill not go into detail, because my delegation fully shares\r\nthe views already expressed by the European Union. I\r\nwish to commend the progress achieved so far in the\r\nwork of the three-tiered mechanism — comprising the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and\r\nthe Commission for Social Development — which has\r\nbeen entrusted with the task of monitoring and\r\nimplementing related to the Summit.\r\nRomania supports the further strengthening of the\r\nfunctions of the Economic and Social Council to ensure\r\nan integrated and multidimensional approach to the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development\r\nand of the other major conferences by harmonizing the\r\nagendas and work programmes of the functional\r\ncommissions and enhancing coordination among relevant\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nUnited Nations agencies and with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. At the same time, more effective use of the\r\ninputs from the three ad hoc task forces of the\r\nAdministrative Committee an Coordination and of the\r\nInter-Agency Committee on Women will be extremely\r\nhelpful in this respect.\r\nWe also encourage the extension of the interactive,\r\ninnovative methods of work introduced in Economic and\r\nSocial Council and some subsidiary bodies including the\r\nCommission for Social Development with a view to\r\ndeveloping dialogue between Governments, the\r\nrepresentatives of civil society and United Nations agencies.\r\nSocial development issues have been a constant\r\npriority item on the agenda of the Romanian Government.\r\nAccording to a modern integrated concept, social welfare\r\npolicy is an important dimension of the Romanian\r\ngoverning programme. One of its major objectives is to\r\nprotect the population against the social costs of the\r\ntransition to a market economy. This policy has been\r\ncarried out in compliance with the provisions of the\r\nConstitution of Romania and the human rights treaties to\r\nwhich it is a party, as well as with other relevant principles,\r\nsuch as: promoting social partnership; tailoring social\r\nprotection to the needs of groups and individuals;\r\ndecentralizing social policy; and striking a balance between\r\nneeds and resources, between protection and self-protection\r\nand between the needs of current and future generations.\r\nIn this context, the outcome of the social Summit\r\nprovided the basis for reviewing and developing the\r\nexisting social strategy and laws of Romania. It also\r\nprovided valuable inspiration for turning our national\r\npotential of social innovation to better account.\r\nIn the period since the Copenhagen Summit, the\r\nRomanian Government has strengthened its actions devoted\r\nto improving living standards and enhancing social\r\nintegration, particularly for the most vulnerable groups.\r\nHere are a few facts. First, a project for the development of\r\nsocial services, sponsored by the Action Plan for\r\nCoordinated Aid to Poland and Hungary, is now well under\r\nway. Secondly, a pilot programme for poverty eradication,\r\nat the level of families and communities, was recently\r\nlaunched in conjunction with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme. Thirdly, through the latest\r\namendments to our law on social assistance, the assistance\r\nto the elderly, the disabled, to families without income or\r\nwith a low income and to other high-risk groups has been\r\nsubstantially improved and diversified. Fourthly, further\r\nmeasures have been taken to enhance the protection of\r\nchildren under the National Plan of Action for Children\r\nto improve health care, education and the family\r\nenvironment. Moreover, a bill on the protection of minors\r\nin special situations was recently put before Parliament.\r\nTwo other important bills, on health insurance and on\r\npensions, aimed at reforming these social welfare\r\nmechanisms are on the agenda of the Romanian\r\nParliament.\r\nIn the field of employment, significant action has\r\nbeen taken to improve training and job access for young\r\npeople. Furthermore, innovative solutions have been used\r\nto reduce unemployment and encourage job creation. For\r\nexample, in order to shift the emphasis from passive\r\nprotection to active self-protection, a part of the\r\nunemployment compensation fund has been successfully\r\nused since 1995 to grant credits for the creation of small\r\nand medium-sized enterprises, with the stipulation that the\r\nentrepreneurs hire unemployed people for at least 50 per\r\ncent of the newly created positions.\r\nConvinced that gender equality is a prerequisite for\r\nsound economic and social development, the Romanian\r\nGovernment has set up, in response to both the Beijing\r\nand the Copenhagen Conferences, a State department for\r\nthe advancement of women. The subject of the\r\nempowerment of women was also broached at a recent\r\nsubregional conference organized in Bucharest in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations on the\r\nimplementation in Central and Eastern Europe of the\r\nBeijing Platform for Action.\r\nThe development of partnership with the main actors\r\nof civil society in the implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe major conferences has been a constant concern of the\r\nRomanian Government. An important institutional step to\r\nthis effect was to set up an interministerial working group\r\nfor cooperation with civil society.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that international\r\ncooperation at all levels — bilateral, regional and\r\nglobal — is crucial for the effective implementation of\r\nthe goals of the social Summit. Therefore, we welcome\r\nthe Austria’s initiative to host a regional conference on\r\nfollow-up to the Summit and wish to participate actively\r\nin its preparation.\r\nMr. Mahugu (Kenya): At the outset, I wish to join\r\nprevious speakers in commending you, Mr. President, on\r\nthe able manner in which you are presiding over the work\r\nof the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nI also wish to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report, contained\r\nin document A/51/348. My delegation would like to\r\nassociate itself with the views expressed by the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China on agenda item 45, on “Implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development”.\r\nEconomic and Social Council resolution 1996/7\r\nreaffirmed the crucial role to be played by the Commission\r\nfor Social Development in the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction underscored the conviction that development and\r\nsocial justice are indispensable for the achievement and\r\nmaintenance of peace and security within and between our\r\nnations. Conversely, social development and social justice\r\ncannot be achieved in the absence of peace and security, or\r\nwithout respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThis interdependence, which was recognized 51 years ago\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations, has acquired even\r\ngreater importance today.\r\nThe holding of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment at Copenhagen in March 1995 was a\r\nsignificant milestone in the realization that the eradication\r\nof poverty, unemployment and social disintegration, and the\r\nachievement of sustainable development required an\r\ninternationally coordinated strategy. Poverty continues to be\r\nthe root cause of most ills in society despite the high level\r\nof prosperity achieved by sections of the world community\r\nthis century. It manifests itself in many ways and should be\r\ntackled in an integrated manner, since economic\r\ndevelopment and social progress are interrelated.\r\nAppropriate action is therefore required to address the\r\neffects of poverty in both developing and developed\r\ncountries.\r\nWe recognize that the primary responsibility for\r\npoverty eradication rests with national Governments and,\r\nmore important, poverty eradication depends on their ability\r\nto mobilize grass-roots community involvement in the\r\ninitiation and execution of income-generating programmes.\r\nHowever, without the timely and effective support of the\r\ninternational community as envisaged in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, these efforts will\r\nhave limited impact.\r\nIn this regard, Kenya commends the Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination for establishing inter-agency\r\ntask forces designed to help coordinate United Nations\r\nactivities in an integrated manner. We are also\r\nencouraged by the initiatives taken so far by the various\r\nUnited Nations bodies to prioritize poverty eradication in\r\ntheir programmes. We therefore look forward to healthy\r\nand enhanced complementarity between national strategies\r\nand the priorities of United Nations bodies and agencies.\r\nTowards this end, my delegation thanks the\r\nSecretary-General, in collaboration with the President of\r\nthe World Bank and the Heads of all United Nations\r\nagencies, for launching the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa on 15 March 1996. Its\r\nprogrammes of concrete action will accelerate Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. We have no doubt that this Initiative on\r\nAfrica, designed to complement the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and\r\nthe System-wide Plan of Action for African Economic\r\nRecovery and Development will be instrumental in the\r\neradication of poverty in Africa.\r\nAs a follow-up to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Government of Kenya, in collaboration\r\nwith the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund, has prepared a comprehensive economic policy\r\nframework paper which outlines the development strategy\r\nand key plans to be implemented over the next three\r\nyears. The national objectives and strategies formulated in\r\nthe policy paper are designed to create conditions for\r\nrapid and sustained economic growth, to a level which\r\nwill result in a significant reduction in unemployment and\r\npoverty in my country on the basis of the following\r\nmeasures: first, maintaining macroeconomic stability by\r\nstrengthening money and public sector financing;\r\nsecondly, improving efficiency in the public sector by\r\naccelerating and streamlining reform in the civil service;\r\nthirdly, enhancing the external and domestic\r\ncompetitiveness of the economy; and fourthly, addressing\r\nthe social aspects of development through targeted\r\npoverty interventions for vulnerable groups.\r\nTo achieve a significant reduction in unemployment\r\nand poverty, our economy needs to grow at an average of\r\nover 5 per cent of real gross domestic product. In this\r\ncontext, my Government has introduced measures\r\ndesigned to provide an enabling environment for private\r\nsector development with an emphasis on policies which\r\nare environmentally friendly. While the policies in support\r\nof growth and the social sectors are designed to ensure\r\nthat the benefits of development reach the poor, targeted\r\ninterventions will be required to provide income support\r\nto those who cannot wait until the growth process gathers\r\nfull steam, as well as to those who cannot readily\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nparticipate in it because of special handicaps such as\r\ngeographical isolation. The most important targeted\r\ninterventions will be in rural areas where the need for\r\nremunerated employment is most acute. Energizing the\r\ninformal sector, as the main source of income for about a\r\nquarter of rural households and possibly more in urban\r\nareas, will be an effective means of reducing poverty.\r\nKenya has designated national focal points to\r\nimplement the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction in an integrated manner. We have established\r\ncommittees from the grass-roots to the national levels,\r\ncomprising Government officials, local communities and\r\nnon-governmental organizations. We have also established\r\nspecial social development funds committed to financing\r\nprojects for social development, including the fight against\r\npoverty at the grass-roots level.\r\nKenya therefore wishes to reaffirm its support for\r\nobservance of the International Year for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty in 1996 and the proclamation of the first United\r\nNations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, as contained\r\nin General Assembly resolution 50/107. We fully recognize\r\nthat the goal of poverty eradication represents a major\r\nchallenge for the United Nations system. In this regard, we\r\nare of the view that the United Nations system has an\r\nimportant role to play in the eradication of poverty by\r\nassisting Member States to translate into reality the global\r\ngoals and commitments of international conferences,\r\nespecially the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nIn order to realize these objectives, there is an urgent\r\nneed to mobilize substantial new and additional resources\r\nfrom all sources, in both developing and developed\r\ncountries, in conformity with the commitments of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. Kenya\r\nurges the urgent fulfilment of the previously agreed United\r\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product of\r\nthe developed countries for the overall official development\r\nassistance as soon as possible, and an increase in the share\r\nof funding for social development programmes.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is convinced that the\r\ninternational community should now demonstrate political\r\nwill by honouring the commitments made if we are to\r\nrealize these objectives.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil): I have the honour to speak on\r\nagenda item 45, “Implementation of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development”. I wish to start by\r\nassociating my delegation with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica, who spoke on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, as well as the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Bolivia, speaking on behalf of the\r\nRio Group. I would also like to commend Ambassador\r\nSomavía’s statement which once again proved that he is\r\na guiding spirit when it comes to this subject.\r\nImportant changes have taken place in recent months\r\nwith regard to the follow-up of the Copenhagen World\r\nSummit. These are reflected in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, which summarizes with clarity the\r\nalternatives open to us to maintain the momentum for the\r\nimplementation of the commitments adopted during that\r\nSummit.\r\nThe Commission for Social Development has been\r\ndesignated by the General Assembly as the functional\r\ncommission with the primary responsibility for addressing\r\nsocial and development matters. In addition, the\r\nCommission has submitted to the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil a multi-year programme of work to the year\r\n2000, providing for comprehensive consideration of\r\nrelevant themes within its field of responsibility.\r\nThese and other steps, enumerated in greater detail\r\nin the report, indicate the need to move from conceptual\r\nto more concrete approaches. The centrality of the\r\nquestion of development is no longer an issue among us.\r\nOn the contrary, the measures recently submitted by the\r\nCommission for Social Development to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council actually reflect a concerted effort to\r\nupgrade the question of development within the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs a consequence of the results of recent global\r\nconferences, new strategies are being considered in the\r\nfight against poverty. In the United Nations, there is a\r\ngrowing awareness that issues such as investment, trade\r\nand financial flows, among others, should be urgently\r\ndiscussed by the Organization. It is also widely felt that\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, when addressing questions\r\nrelated to development, should lay stronger emphasis on\r\nthe social dimension of structural adjustment programmes.\r\nThese changes have firm and historic roots. They\r\nalso reflect ongoing discussions regarding the concrete\r\nmeasures the United Nations should take to raise strong\r\nand visible support in the fight against poverty. For my\r\ndelegation, it is particularly encouraging in this context to\r\nwelcome the fact that the Secretary-General has been\r\nasked by the Commission for Social Development to\r\nconsult with relevant international organizations, among\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nthem the Bretton Woods institutions, with a view to\r\nsecuring their cooperation in the implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen Programme of Action. We hope that\r\nappropriate mechanisms will be soon established to\r\nfacilitate this dialogue.\r\nThese efforts, inspired and undertaken by the United\r\nNations, are indeed important. They constitute the\r\nbackground against which we must work. But when it\r\ncomes to the implementation and monitoring of the\r\nmechanisms set forth in Copenhagen, nothing can replace\r\nthe role that Governments and civil society must play at the\r\nnational level. This was recognized by the Heads of State\r\nor Government at the Summit.\r\nIn Latin America, there is a growing awareness of this\r\nbalance between self-promoted development and\r\nmultilateral cooperation. As a consequence, Governments in\r\nthe region have adopted a more realistic approach in their\r\nattempts to translate into concrete action their political\r\ncommitment to the Summit’s recommendations. The Rio\r\nGroup countries, for instance, have established a regional\r\nmechanism dedicated to defining priorities designed to\r\nstrengthen social policy programmes. Since Copenhagen, a\r\nnumber of meetings have taken place with the objective of\r\nreviewing and reformulating existing social policies on the\r\nbasis of an integrated approach to social development. Two\r\nof these meetings were held at the ministerial level, in\r\nBuenos Aires and in Quito. The Summit of the Heads of\r\nState and Heads of Government of the Rio Group, which\r\ntook place in Bolivia last September, highlighted the\r\npriorities accorded by the Group to the challenges facing\r\nour region.\r\nAs indicated in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nBrazil will have the honour next year to host a meeting in\r\nSão Paulo at a high political level to evaluate the progress\r\nmade towards implementing the outcome of the Summit.\r\nThis event will be held in cooperation with the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which\r\nplayed a key role in the Summit follow-up meetings of\r\nQuito and Buenos Aires. Other players with an active role\r\nin the development question will also participate, including\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nWe welcome the cooperation of non-governmental\r\norganizations in this domain. As we all know, as its priority\r\ntask next year the Commission on Social Development will\r\nbe targeting matters related to productive employment and\r\nsustainable livelihood. It is only logical to assume that such\r\nthemes could greatly benefit from the interaction generated\r\nby the participation of different segments of our civil\r\nsocieties in these discussions.\r\nBrazil has often stated that a country’s capacity to\r\nsatisfy the needs of its people depends on good social\r\nindicators, political stability, economic competitiveness,\r\nand scientific and technological progress. Without\r\neconomic growth, however, the elimination of poverty,\r\nunemployment and marginalization loses the very fuel\r\nupon which it depends to revise adverse situations in\r\nthese different domains. The common denominator of the\r\nmultiple aspects of these problems is still development.\r\nTherein lies the key to peace, social justice, full\r\nemployment and democracy.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Speaking today under agenda item 45, entitled\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development”, I should like to associate myself\r\nwith the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. My country’s contribution will\r\nconsequently be based on certain themes that are of\r\nparticular interest to us.\r\nThe review of the follow-up of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit offers us, for the second consecutive year, the\r\nopportunity to review at both the national and\r\ninternational levels our achievements in the context of the\r\nobjectives and commitments assumed at the Summit.\r\nClearly, this will not be an exhaustive consideration, and\r\neven less a stock-taking, since the task we have set\r\nourselves is a long-term one. Nevertheless, in this way we\r\nare continuing our dialogue on the best ways and means\r\nof strengthening the necessary complementarity among\r\nour countries in a world dominated by globalization and\r\ninterdependence.\r\nGlobalization is a positive force for the future of the\r\nentire world: unprecedented development in investment\r\nand trade, the opening up of the most populous regions of\r\nthe world to international trade; and the possibility for\r\nmore developing countries to improve their populations’\r\nliving standards. Nevertheless, globalization also entails\r\nrisks and can have potentially negative consequences for\r\ndevelopment by exacerbating inequalities among countries\r\nand, within countries themselves, among individuals.\r\nOf course, no country is immune to this trend, but\r\nthe threat looms chiefly over the countries of the South,\r\nparticularly those low-income countries that are unable to\r\nbenefit from the advantages of globalization and are\r\nbecoming increasingly marginalized. This is why our\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ncountry, in the resolution adopted last year on the agenda\r\nitem now under consideration, reaffirmed the validity of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. It was\r\nalso stressed that strong determination is needed to invest\r\nin people and in their well-being in order to achieve the\r\nobjectives of social development. We must commit\r\nourselves to reducing poverty, eradicating destitution,\r\ncreating new job possibilities and reducing unemployment.\r\nTo this end, the promotion of an integrated and\r\nmultidimensional approach was underlined. These\r\nfundamental elements for the implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action should\r\nbe considered within the context of an effective partnership\r\nand cooperation among Governments and individuals in\r\ncivil society.\r\nMr. Fernández Estigarribia (Paraguay), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIn this connection, concerning national action for the\r\neffective implementation of the commitments assumed at\r\nCopenhagen, I should like to recall here the main areas in\r\nwhich my country has already taken action. Tunisia’s\r\npioneering and innovative achievements in this respect have\r\nin many ways been reinforced by the decisions of the\r\ninternational community within the context of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. Tunisia’s actions for\r\nsocial development are ambitious and multidimensional.\r\nThey are the cornerstone of our national policy to ensure\r\nthe well-being and prosperity of the entire population, and\r\nthey aim to guarantee both present and future generations\r\nconditions that are conducive to equity and prosperity.\r\nI should like briefly to touch on a number of sectoral\r\nand inter-sectoral programmes, such as the initiative for the\r\nadvancement of women, which Tunisia set up to ensure that\r\ncomprehensive sustainable development, for the country.\r\nThe main aspect of this multidimensional action is\r\nunquestionably the advancement of the role of women in\r\nthe development process. We have taken many and varied\r\nmeasures in this area. In 1988, President Zine El Abidine\r\nBen Ali reaffirmed his devotion to the “Code of Rights and\r\nObligations”, a real source of pride for modern Tunisia. He\r\ndid this by creating a ministry for women’s and family\r\naffairs.\r\nA monitoring mechanism on the status of women was\r\nset up to remedy the lack of information on the role of\r\nwomen in economic activity. Its task is to gather\r\ninformation on the situation of women and to analyse and\r\ndisseminate it. A special programme was begun aimed at\r\nintegrating 67,000 young women, aged 15 to 29, in the\r\nnational literacy programme.\r\nGreater opportunities have been made available to\r\nwomen so that they can benefit from continuing training\r\nprogrammes and improve their chances of access to\r\nmanagement posts. We have also strengthened their right\r\nto work by enacting legislation and specific measures, and\r\nseveral projects in favour of rural women have been\r\ninitiated.\r\nThe second aspect of social development that I\r\nwould like to touch on relates to education, teaching,\r\nscientific research and vocational training. In Tunisia,\r\nbasic education is free of charge and compulsory until the\r\nage of 17. The educational system was restructured in\r\n1991, from kindergarten up to the last year of higher\r\neducation. In the area of scientific research, a State\r\nsecretariat was set up, followed by the establishment of\r\nnew specialized institutes for scientific research. The\r\nvocational- training sector was also completely\r\nrestructured, which has led to the creation of new,\r\nspecialized structures.\r\nAnother, no less important, area of human\r\ndevelopment is that of basic health care. This sector,\r\nwhich has always been a priority, has received additional\r\nimpetus during this past decade. The resources allocated\r\nto this sector have increased consistently, in the range of\r\n23 per cent per year. Through the mobilization of\r\nsupplementary human and material resources, we have\r\nseen improvements in health-care coverage and in the\r\nmain health indicators. Tunisia has thus reached the goals\r\nof “Health for All by the Year 2000”, as advocated by the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO).\r\nA key sector to which Tunisia attaches priority\r\nimportance is that of children. Tunisia considers\r\nimproving the status of children as an integral part of the\r\ngeneral amelioration of the social situation. Accordingly,\r\nit has focused its efforts on developing mechanisms to\r\nensure the follow-up and monitoring of children in order\r\nto protect them and to promote their development. In this\r\nrespect, Tunisia has adopted a code for the protection of\r\nthe rights of children.\r\nOne last point that is fundamental to the national\r\ndevelopment strategy is that of promoting social solidarity\r\nin the context of combating exclusion. Tunisian policy in\r\nthis area consists of employment programmes creating\r\nincome sources and combating poverty in all its aspects.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nI should like to mention here certain achievements in\r\nthis area. The national programme for needy families has\r\nrisen from 73,590 recipient families in 1987 to 101,000 in\r\n1993. As regards child protection, over the last few years\r\n100,000 children from 3 to 6 years of age have benefited\r\nfrom children’s development programmes. Several centres\r\nfor social defence and social integration have been created,\r\nand a number of activities have been carried out for the\r\nadvancement of the disabled and for their inclusion in\r\nactive life. We have set up several regional centres to\r\nprotect elderly persons in need and benefits given to the\r\nelderly have been increased.\r\nI should like to dwell a little longer on the National\r\nSolidarity Fund, the latest of our achievements for human\r\ndevelopment. Created in 1992 at the initiative of the\r\nPresident of the Republic, the National Solidarity Fund is\r\naimed at financing services for low-income social\r\ncategories and for towns lacking the minimum of basic\r\ninfrastructures. Generally, it applies to isolated rural areas\r\nthat are difficult to reach and that, due to the high unit cost\r\nof services, do not meet the criteria laid down in\r\ndevelopment plans. The Fund is financed from various\r\nsources, in particular by voluntary contributions from\r\ncitizens, and enterprises and by grants and subsidies\r\nallocated by the State budget.\r\nIn 1993, a standing committee for the Solidarity Fund\r\nwas set up to define, together with the central and regional\r\nadministration services, criteria for identifying priority\r\nintervention areas. Along with these services, it monitors\r\nthe implementation and progress of projects.\r\nSix basic services were identified: roads and tracks,\r\ndrinking water, electrification, education, health and\r\nhousing, to which have been added cultural centres, youth\r\nactivity centres, sanitation, combating desertification, and so\r\non.\r\nIn 1994, the Fund was charged with improving income\r\nand employment levels in the zones concerned, and with\r\nseeing that people remain on their lands and in their home\r\nareas, which involves creating and consolidating income\r\nsources. From 1993 to 1996, the National Solidarity Fund\r\nmade it possible to provide 35,160 homes with electricity\r\nand 60,382 homes with drinking water; to build or to\r\nimprove 8,796 homes; and to build 1,565 kilometres of\r\nroads and tracks, 75 schools and 71 health-care centres.\r\nThe impact of the Fund on the populations concerned\r\nhas been extremely beneficial, and it has further increased\r\nthe spirit of solidarity of the Tunisian people in this respect.\r\nThus, we decided to implement, during the period 1995\r\nto 2000, a more ambitious national programme to develop\r\nall of the marginal areas by the year 2000. To strengthen\r\nthese development activities, in 1996 the Fund was\r\nconverted to a State secretariat.\r\nAs regards action at the international level for the\r\nfollow-up to the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nTunisia believes that the entire international community\r\nmust mobilize, in a spirit of solidarity and effectiveness,\r\nto support the efforts and the sacrifices made by the\r\ndeveloping countries in this area. However, we must\r\nrecognize that the work now being done by the developed\r\ncountries and by the United Nations system is not\r\ncommensurate with the scale of the problems facing many\r\ncountries, including a large number of African countries.\r\nThis shortfall is reflected in the level of official\r\ndevelopment assistance and of investment, and in the way\r\nthe debt problem is being dealt with.\r\nIn this spirit, we must urgently strive to reach the\r\ngoal, set by the Summit, of devoting 0.7 per cent of the\r\ngross national product of developed countries to official\r\ndevelopment assistance. It would also be useful to\r\nmobilize new, substantial additional resources from all\r\nsources, whether national or international, public or\r\nprivate, traditional or new.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation is pleased with the\r\ncommitment assumed by the G-7 Summit, held in Lyons\r\nin June 1996, to set in motion a world partnership for\r\ndevelopment for countries with emerging economies, for\r\nthe poorest countries and for the sub-Saharan African\r\ncountries. We also note the commitment of the G-7\r\ncountries to contribute to the creation of an enabling\r\nenvironment for private trade and financial flows to\r\ndeveloping countries, as well as to guarantee major flows\r\nof official development assistance and to improve the\r\nquality of that assistance.\r\nAs regards international cooperation to promote\r\nsustainable development and with respect to building a\r\nconsensus on development objectives and policies, my\r\ndelegation would like to recall the following:\r\nMember countries should undertake to respect the\r\n20/20 formula. This implies firstly that the industrialized\r\ncountries should devote 20 per cent of their official\r\ndevelopment assistance to basic social programmes. It is\r\nclear that developing countries at the same time should\r\ndevote 20 per cent of their national budgets to human\r\ndevelopment.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nAs regards new and innovative ideas to mobilize\r\nfunds, the following principles should be reaffirmed. Funds\r\nmobilized by new and innovative ideas should not take the\r\nplace of official development assistance. New and\r\ninnovative funding methods should be distinct from\r\nfinancing from the regular budget and peacekeeping budget\r\nof the United Nations. Lastly, we feel that public\r\ninvestment remains necessary, but it must be supported by\r\nprivate investment in financing for development.\r\nAs regards the United Nations in the coordination and\r\nimplementation of policies decided at the multilateral level,\r\nTunisia stresses the essential role of the Organization. Its\r\neffectiveness, however, depends on its capacity to adapt,\r\nand on the political will of States to strengthen cooperation\r\nand partnership for economic and social development.\r\nIn this respect, Tunisia is pleased with the expansion\r\nof the mandate of the Commission for Social Development,\r\nwhich has been given the chief responsibility for the\r\nfollow-up and review of the application of the results of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. However, we\r\nwould like to stress that the Commission will only be able\r\nto carry out its work successfully if Member States provide\r\ntangible support and give it the necessary means.\r\nLastly, as regards the specialized agencies, and\r\nparticularly the Bretton Woods institutions, Tunisia would\r\nlike to mention the role they have been given in mobilizing\r\nfinancial resources for social development and in acting on\r\nthe commitments undertaken at Copenhagen, particularly as\r\nregards debt reduction in developing countries and\r\nassistance to countries carrying out structural adjustments\r\nso that they can move from the stage of adjustment to that\r\nof development.\r\nMr. Hormel (United States of America): When Vice-\r\nPresident Gore addressed the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, he asked the question: “What can be done to\r\nlift the poorest of our citizens into productive lives?” It is\r\nfitting that we take stock today of the progress we have\r\nmade in implementing the ambitious commitments made 18\r\nmonths ago in Copenhagen.\r\nAs representatives of Governments, we agreed at the\r\nSummit that we, in partnership with non-governmental\r\norganizations and the actors of civil society, would\r\neradicate absolute poverty, create jobs, and empower\r\nwomen and men, especially older persons and people with\r\ndisabilities, to become full participants in their societies.\r\nThese are challenging goals, but the tools are at hand to\r\nachieve them and progress has been made.\r\nThe United States is committed to alleviating\r\npoverty by attacking its root causes. Indeed, in his State\r\nof the Union address this year, President Clinton spoke to\r\na number of issues that address this goal. These include\r\na call for an increase in the minimum wage, which was\r\nrecently enacted by our Congress; the need for pensions\r\nfor all workers; and reform of health insurance policies so\r\nthat people will be able to keep health insurance when\r\nthey change jobs and be free of the fear that they will not\r\nbe able to get health insurance in a new job because of\r\ntheir health condition. The health insurance reforms have\r\nalso been signed into law by President Clinton.\r\nWe are dedicated to reducing the federal deficit,\r\nwhich is key to investment, growth and job creation. We\r\nare also addressing falling real wages, and expanding tax\r\ncredits for working families with children. Action to\r\nensure that spouses pay child support, and strategies to\r\nprovide support for child care for working parents, are\r\nalso priorities.\r\nAt Copenhagen, we gave the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) a mandate to address\r\npoverty alleviation through coordinated social\r\ndevelopment programmes. My Government fully supports\r\nUNDP’s commitment to poverty eradication through its\r\nPoverty Strategies Initiative. We also called on the\r\nmultilateral development banks and other donors to\r\nenhance targeted social development investment lending.\r\nWe are pleased that the international financial institutions,\r\nparticularly the World Bank and the Asian and\r\nInter-American Development Banks, are responding to\r\nthis imperative.\r\nEmployment growth and poverty alleviation are\r\ncritically linked. The United States is currently enjoying\r\none of the lowest rates of unemployment since the early\r\n1970s. Equally important, we have seen unemployment\r\nrates fall while inflation has remained in check. While the\r\nUnited States clearly has not faced the daunting economic\r\nchallenges of the developing countries, some factors that\r\nhave helped us to achieve this positive state of affairs\r\nmay be applicable elsewhere.\r\nA society in which individuals are encouraged to\r\ntake initiative, coupled with a flexible job market that\r\nfacilitates rather than impedes mobility, is a key factor.\r\nSimilarly, an economy open to competition will help to\r\nprovide the confidence needed to attract private\r\ninvestment that is critical to growth and job creation.\r\nFinally, sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented\r\nby a government which is transparent and accountable\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nwill also help to provide the confidence needed to attract\r\nprivate sector investment that is critical to growth and job\r\ncreation.\r\nWe gathered in Copenhagen to chart a course of action\r\nthat would “put people first”. Unfortunately, progress has\r\nbeen painfully slow with regard to the integration of people\r\nwith disabilities into the economic and social mainstream.\r\nWe recall that the Copenhagen Declaration on Social\r\nDevelopment stated that\r\n“one of the world’s largest minorities, more than\r\n1 in 10, are people with disabilities, who are too\r\noften forced into poverty, unemployment and\r\nsocial isolation.” (A/CONF.166/9, chap. I,\r\nresolution 1, annex I, para. 16 (h))\r\nAlthough the series of United Nations conferences has\r\nfocused increasing attention on issues affecting the disabled,\r\nwe must not lose the momentum gained through the\r\ncommitment of the global community. For instance, we are\r\nseeing that more and more countries are adopting\r\nnon-discrimination laws that protect the rights of persons\r\nwith disabilities. This is an essential step towards\r\nempowerment, inclusion, and fostering independence.\r\nWork within the United Nations on disability issues\r\ncontinues to achieve modest and positive success. This is\r\ndue largely to the efforts of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment’s Special Rapporteur on Disability, who is\r\nnow in the third year of assisting Member States to\r\nimplement the Standard Rules on the Equalization of\r\nOpportunities for Persons with Disabilities that were\r\nadopted by this body in 1993. His work should continue. A\r\npanel of experts to advise the Special Rapporteur ensures\r\nthat non-governmental organizations working in the\r\ndisability field do so in partnership with the United\r\nNations — again, work that must continue and be a priority\r\nin the future.\r\nThe First Lady of the United States, Hillary Rodham\r\nClinton, pledged in Copenhagen an investment of $100\r\nmillion over 10 years to achieve higher school-completion\r\nrates for girls in developing countries. Girls’ education is\r\none of the most important investments developing countries\r\ncan make. Yet out of every three children who are not in\r\nschool, two are girls. The Girls’ and Women’s Education\r\nInitiative (GWEI) signalled a new commitment that all\r\nbasic education programmes assisted by the United States\r\nAgency for International Development (USAID) will\r\naddress the special barriers that prevent girls from enroling,\r\ncompleting and achieving equally with boys in school.\r\nIn September of this year, a special GWEI project\r\nwas awarded to provide technical leadership to this effort.\r\nUSAID currently funds basic education activities in 22\r\ncountries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Near\r\nEast. Under the new project, six “emphasis” countries will\r\nfocus on building sustainable public-private partnerships\r\nto support girls’ and women’s education.\r\nThe New Partnerships Initiative, announced in\r\nCopenhagen by Vice-President Gore, is a comprehensive\r\nframework to strengthen civil society and to encourage\r\npartnership between the public and private sectors. It is an\r\napproach to sustainable development that seeks to\r\ntranscend old debates about the relative merits of\r\ntop-down or bottom-up assistance models. Instead, it\r\nstresses the need to build synergy between efforts at both\r\nlevels and across the sectors within which our Agency for\r\nInternational Development works.\r\nWorking with partners in 18 countries, USAID is\r\nundertaking a learning process designed to explore and\r\ndocument new ways to build capacity and linkages among\r\ngroups at the local level; to forge solid society-to-society\r\nlinkages between these local groups and their United\r\nStates counterparts; and to foster a legal, regulatory and\r\nfiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and\r\ncommunity initiative.\r\nUSAID’s micro-enterprise programme, initiated in\r\nJune 1994, is designed to reach the poorest members of\r\nsociety, particularly women, with loans and savings\r\nservices. It aims to build financially independent\r\ninstitutions that serve increasing numbers of poor\r\nentrepreneurs. During 1996, USAID allocated $120\r\nmillion for micro-enterprise funding in developing\r\ncountries. At a recent congressional round table, USAID\r\npledged to continue its micro-enterprise initiative in 1997\r\nand 1998.\r\nIn its resolution 50/161, this body established a\r\nthree-tiered process, including the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Commission for\r\nSocial Development, to monitor implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. In\r\nJuly, the Economic and Social Council decided to\r\nannualize the meetings of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment and to expand its membership in order to\r\nstrengthen the Commission’s ability to fulfil this\r\nmonitoring role. It is well known that my Government\r\nopposed this decision by the Council. Now we must work\r\ntogether to ensure that the Commission can respond\r\neffectively to its new mandate.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Commission has adopted\r\na multi-year program of work, and we applaud its decision\r\nto invite experts to contribute to that work. The\r\nCommission has chosen the theme of employment for\r\nreview at its next session. We look forward to participating\r\nin that discussion, while emphasizing that the Commission\r\nmust work closely with the International Labour\r\nOrganization in its consideration of this topic. The ILO\r\nchairs the Summit follow-up Task Force on full\r\nemployment and sustainable livelihoods for all.\r\nIf the promise of Copenhagen is to be realized, we\r\nmust affirm our commitment to the goals of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. The United States is\r\nprepared to do its part to work for a more just and\r\nequitable global community.\r\nMr. Biørn Lian (Norway): My delegation fully\r\nsupports the statement made by the representative of the\r\nEuropean Union. We would like, however, to make a few\r\nadditional comments regarding the follow-up of the 20/20\r\ninitiative.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development in\r\nCopenhagen was a manifestation of a growing consensus\r\nthat people must be at the centre of our development\r\nefforts. A central aspect of this consensus is the\r\ncommitment to the goal of universal access to basic social\r\nservices. Such services do not only produce invaluable\r\nsocial benefits; they are essential for sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment and constitute an investment in people’s hopes\r\nfor the future. Investing in people’s health and education\r\nis a long-term investment for the benefit of society at large\r\nand should be an integral part of any strategy for poverty\r\neradication and sustainable development.\r\nInternational conferences such as the Summit have\r\noften been criticized for producing statements of good\r\nintentions, but little action. One of the Summit’s outcomes\r\nthat could prove such criticisms wrong was the call upon\r\ninterested countries to implement the so-called 20/20\r\ninitiative, which aims at achieving universal access to basic\r\nsocial services. We believe the 20/20 concept has a special\r\nappeal, inter alia, because of the mutuality of the\r\ncommitment involved. It does not address the donor\r\ncommunity alone, nor is it another conditionality for aid. It\r\nis intended to be a tool for both developing countries and\r\ntheir partners jointly to give higher priority to basic social\r\nservices.\r\nNorway has taken a special interest in making sure\r\nthat this commitment from Copenhagen is translated into\r\naction. Together with the Government of the Netherlands,\r\nwe therefore invited interested countries and multilateral\r\norganizations to Oslo in April of this year in order to\r\nconsider ways to implement this initiative. Today I am\r\nable to report that the meeting was successful. A\r\ncomprehensive analysis of the 20/20 initiative and its\r\npotential was undertaken, and I believe that we managed\r\nto bring the objective of universal access to basic social\r\nservices one important step closer to becoming a reality.\r\nThere was broad agreement at the meeting in Oslo\r\nthat the fight against poverty requires a broad range of\r\npolicies and actions at all levels, including, inter alia,\r\nsuch macroeconomic policies and actions to meet basic\r\nhuman needs. Within this framework, development of\r\nbasic social services was considered of particular\r\nimportance in reducing the worst aspects of poverty and\r\nas a key element in breaking the poverty cycle.\r\nThe 20/20 initiative should be seen in this context\r\nand should be applied as a pragmatic and flexible\r\nguideline. The full outcome of the Oslo meeting — “The\r\nOslo Consensus on 20/20” — is available as United\r\nNations document A/51/140.\r\nHaving said that, the real test of success will, of\r\ncourse, be the extent to which we are able to translate the\r\nOslo Consensus into practical action. Participants at the\r\nOslo meeting agreed that developing countries should take\r\nthe lead and set the priorities. Developing-country\r\nGovernments were encouraged to prepare basic social\r\nprogrammes as part of the poverty-reduction strategy\r\nsuggested by the Summit, with the aim of achieving\r\nuniversal access to basic social services over an ambitious\r\nbut realistic time period. Donor countries and multilateral\r\nagencies were invited to provide technical and financial\r\nsupport for the preparation and implementation of such\r\nprogrammes. Several developing countries present\r\nexpressed their interest in being “pilot cases” for the\r\ninitiative.\r\nFor our part, we recently had a review of our\r\ndevelopment cooperation policy in the Norwegian\r\nParliament, and I am happy to report that there was\r\nstrong support for giving increased priority to basic social\r\nservices and for reaching, and even going beyond, the\r\n20/20 goal. This has now been followed up in the\r\nGovernment’s budget proposal for 1997, which includes\r\nsignificant increases in the allocations for health and\r\neducation purposes.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nThe participants in the Oslo meeting agreed that a\r\nfollow-up meeting should be held within two years to\r\nexchange information and experience, and to review and\r\nassess progress in implementing the 20/20 initiative.\r\nNorway took on the responsibility of ensuring that such a\r\nfollow-up meeting will take place. It is our sincere hope\r\nthat interest in the initiative will have grown significantly\r\nby then and that we will be able to review concrete\r\nexperiences underway in a number of countries.\r\nMr. Scarpetta (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is my honour to address the General Assembly\r\non agenda item 45, “Implementation of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development”. Colombia\r\nassociates itself with the statement made this morning by\r\nCosta Rica in its capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77\r\nand China, and wishes to express its gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for the report on the item before us\r\ntoday.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development was a\r\nhistoric event that brought together the Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the world in order to recognize the\r\nimportance of social development and the well-being of\r\nhumanity, and to give the highest priority to these\r\nobjectives in the light of the urgent need to solve serious\r\nsocial problems, particularly poverty, unemployment and\r\nsocial exclusion.\r\nDuring the Summit the Heads of State or Government\r\nrecognized that the primary responsibility to attain the goals\r\nset out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction rested with the national Governments themselves.\r\nThe previous session of the General Assembly reiterated its\r\ncall to Governments to define time-bound goals and targets\r\nfor reducing overall poverty and for expanding employment\r\nissues as issues of the highest priority.\r\nThe guidelines that the Government of Colombia has\r\nfollowed in drafting its development plan, known nationally\r\nas the “Social Leap”, fully coincide with those of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit. The Government’s development plan\r\ngives priority to the eradication of poverty, the creation of\r\nproductive employment, social integration and attending to\r\nthe basic needs of society.\r\nThe Government of Colombia has set in motion the\r\nSocial Solidarity Network, a central element of its strategy.\r\nIts objective is to improve the living conditions of the\r\npoorest and most vulnerable sectors, and to facilitate their\r\nparticipation in the major social programmes through joint\r\nefforts by State and regional institutions, non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society. The Social Solidarity\r\nNetwork has been implementing 13 special programmes,\r\naimed at the most vulnerable sectors of the population\r\naffected by poverty.\r\nThese include the plan for emergency urban\r\nemployment, through which the Government has\r\nco-financed 572 projects that have benefited 42,400\r\npeople. The assistance programme to support and train the\r\npoor and the unemployed has benefited 21,000 low-\r\nincome young people. The plan for emergency rural\r\nemployment has financed 635 projects that have generated\r\nincome for 27,000 families. The programme for child and\r\nmaternal care has provided subsidized social security for\r\n82,000 mothers and 64,000 children under a year of age.\r\nClose to 900,000 children have benefited from the\r\nprogrammes for food assistance. The programme to\r\nsupport mothers who are heads of families with children\r\nin elementary schools has assisted 78,128 mothers. The\r\nprogramme to help the elderly, which focuses on the most\r\nvulnerable group — the destitute elderly — has aided\r\n67,000 people. The rural housing programme has\r\nprovided subsidies for 147,343 families; and owing to the\r\nprogramme for sport and artistic talent, 2,150 young\r\npeople have obtained access to economic support.\r\nLikewise, among the social policies in favour of\r\nchildren, the Government has promoted a “pact for\r\nchildhood”, through which the Government and civil\r\nsociety have carried out joint activities in the fields of\r\nhealth, nutrition, education, childhood protection and\r\njustice, all within a structured and permanent plan.\r\nIn this way, the Government fulfils one of the\r\nobjectives of the Declaration by defining goals and\r\nobjectives, within a time-bound framework, in order to\r\nreduce poverty and to increase employment. The\r\nGovernment has formulated specific and concrete plans\r\naimed at modernizing the productive structures of the\r\ncountry, in order to legitimize a new economic plan\r\nthrough genuine proposals for social development, based\r\non the concept of social solidarity and good governance.\r\nAt the regional level, Colombia has actively\r\nparticipated in meetings convened by the Rio Group. In\r\nthis regard it associates itself with the statement made by\r\nBolivia on behalf of the Group. During the most recent\r\nRio Group Summit, which took place in Cochabamba on\r\n3 and 4 September, the Governments reiterated their\r\ncommitment to fight against poverty, malnutrition,\r\nmarginalization, lack of access to health services, and\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nilliteracy, through policies aimed at sustainable social\r\ndevelopment in the mid- and long term.\r\nIn addition to the efforts made by Governments in the\r\nnational context, it is necessary to reiterate, as the\r\nSecretary-General does in his report, the importance of\r\ninternational support and cooperation among nations,\r\nincluding between developed and developing countries and\r\namong individual developing countries. This cooperation\r\nshould be based on equality, mutual benefit and the spirit\r\nof solidarity. Technical assistance for national programmes\r\nand the support of international financial organisms are\r\nrequired.\r\nThe General Assembly in its resolution 50/161\r\nreaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual\r\ncommitment between interested developed and developing\r\ncountries to allocate, on average, 20 per cent of official\r\ndevelopment assistance and 20 per cent of the national\r\nbudget, respectively, to basic social programmes. This\r\ninitiative, if carried out effectively, should benefit the\r\npoorest and most vulnerable social sectors.\r\nIt is equally necessary effectively to fulfil a\r\ncommitment of the Copenhagen Declaration: the pledge of\r\nthe donor Governments to strive to achieve as soon as\r\npossible the agreed target of allocating 0.7 per cent of their\r\ngross national product to official development assistance.\r\nThese two important commitments were reiterated by\r\nPresident Ernesto Samper Pizano, in his capacity as\r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, in the message\r\nhe addressed to French President Jacques Chirac, in the\r\nlatter’s capacity as Chairman of the Group of Seven on the\r\neve of that Group’s meeting in Lyon.\r\nThe United Nations should play a fundamental role in\r\nfollowing up on the implementation of the Summit results.\r\nIn this regard, the Commission for Social Development’s\r\nrecent important decisions to hold annual meetings and to\r\nincrease its membership will make its work more effective.\r\nColombia also hopes that the International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty and the first United Nations Decade\r\nfor the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) will lead to\r\nsignificant progress. These would be laudable results of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit, where the current Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Chile to the United Nations acted so well\r\nas Vice-President and Chairman of the Main Committee.\r\nColombia will continue to implement firm internal\r\nmeasures to combat poverty and unemployment and to\r\npromote social integration, since it is convinced that we\r\nshould focus on the human being as the centre of\r\ndevelopment. As President Ernesto Samper stated to this\r\nbody, the final objective should be the creation of a new\r\ncitizen who is more productive in the economic field,\r\nparticipates more in the political field, and provides more\r\nsolidarity in the social field.\r\nMrs. Florez Prida (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): May I, at the outset, endorse the statement\r\nmade by the delegation of Costa Rica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development is\r\ncredited with having strengthened our recognition of the\r\nhuman being as the purpose and goal of any national or\r\nglobal strategy or policy for development. However, there\r\nare still innumerable obstacles to achieving this goal,\r\nmany of them structural.\r\n1996 has marked an important turning point in the\r\nSummit follow-up, primarily because of the focus on the\r\nmultidimensional and multisectoral nature of international\r\ncooperation for the eradication of poverty. Last year, 25\r\nper cent of the world’s population lived below the\r\nunbearable level of absolute poverty, most of them in\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa. Inequality in\r\nthe distribution of wealth at the global, national and\r\nterritorial levels has been growing rapidly.\r\nMy delegation is deeply concerned by the situation\r\ndescribed by the Secretary-General in his report in\r\ndocument A/51/348. It shows that, although some\r\nprogress has been made, it is not enough given the extent\r\nof the problems, some of which, rather than abating, have\r\ngotten worse. The difficult situation facing the\r\ninternational mobilization of development resources\r\ndeserves special attention. The official development\r\nassistance provided by most donor countries has\r\ndecreased and, apparently, will continue to dwindle over\r\nthe next several years, since the foreign assistance has\r\nbeen one of the budget items most affected by deficit-\r\nreduction programmes in donor countries.\r\nThe burden of the foreign debt continues to crush a\r\nsignificant number of developing countries and the\r\nproposed relief measures are in many cases accompanied\r\nby the imposition of structural reform and adjustment\r\nprogrammes, whose negative impact on the people of the\r\ndebtor countries has contributed to the development of\r\nexplosive social situations in those countries. The\r\nglobalization of the economy and the effects of neoliberal\r\npolicies are increasingly frustrating the realization of the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nnoble goals of social justice included in the Copenhagen\r\ncommitments.\r\nThe African countries and the so-called least\r\ndeveloped countries need special attention. For this group\r\nof nations, recent developments have been extremely\r\nnegative. Political will continues to be crucial to solving the\r\ngloomy prospects ahead. Resources do exist, but they are\r\nwasted on an arms race inconceivable in the wake of the\r\nso-called end of the cold war.\r\nMy delegation wishes to express its most resolute\r\nsupport for the decisions of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil on the composition and working methods of the\r\nCommission for Social Development, and is convinced that\r\nthis body is in a better position today to fulfil the mandate\r\nthis Assembly entrusted to it in resolution 50/161.\r\nI should also like to recognize the results achieved\r\nthrough the system-wide coordination of work on the\r\nCopenhagen Summit follow-up. This was evident in the\r\norganization of discussions and additional activities during\r\nthe International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. We\r\nhope that there will be further improvements during the\r\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty,\r\nwhich begins next year.\r\nOver the last three decades, Cuba has designed and\r\nput into practice, with significant results, policies and\r\nstrategies aimed at achieving development on the basis of\r\na fairer and more equitable distribution of available\r\nresources. Cuba has thus managed to meet primary health,\r\neducation and social-security needs, to mention but a few\r\nand, according to several indices, even to surpass them,\r\ndespite a particularly tense economic situation, aggravated\r\nby the tightening of the United States blockade of Cuba.\r\nThese results have reinforced the validity of the thesis\r\nthat, in a framework of social justice, it is possible to\r\nachieve certain basic social development goals in\r\ncircumstances of scarce economic growth and even decline.\r\nHowever, numerous social development projects have been\r\ndiscontinued and it has become apparent that it is\r\nimpossible for us to make steady progress towards social\r\ndevelopment without an international environment\r\nconducive to our economic growth and overall\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy country, as always, is ready to share its\r\nexperiences in this sphere and to participate actively in any\r\neffort of the international community to promote\r\ncompliance with the commitments entered into during the\r\nCopenhagen Summit.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): I would first like to\r\nwelcome the consideration of the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development in this plenary session.\r\nIt reflects the level of importance attached to the\r\ncommitments made in Copenhagen. I would also like to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Permanent Representative\r\nof Costa Rica for the statement she delivered on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nWhen the international community decided to\r\nconvene the World Summit for Social Development, it\r\ndid so with the clear purpose of promoting higher\r\nstandards of living, full employment and conditions of\r\neconomic and social progress and development. It did so\r\nto find solutions to international economic, social, health\r\nand related problems. While the Summit did succeed in\r\nbringing together Heads of State and Government to lend\r\nthe highest levels of support to this undertaking, and did\r\nmove social development to the centre of international\r\nattention, serious problems remain. The developing\r\ncountries have not reaped the benefits of globalization and\r\nin fact many of their economies continue to suffer\r\nreversals. Rampant poverty in the world remains one of\r\nthe more serious threats to peace and stability, in addition\r\nto being a barrier to social progress.\r\nWe in the international community committed\r\nourselves to eradicating poverty. We committed ourselves\r\nto creating an enabling environment for social\r\ndevelopment. We committed ourselves to an agenda that\r\nwould remove obstacles, free the potential of the\r\nindividual to improve his or her standard of living and the\r\nwelfare of children. The propositions enunciated at\r\nCopenhagen were simple: reduce poverty, increase\r\nemployment, improve social integration. Yet too many\r\ncountries remain marginalized with little sign of help\r\nforthcoming in the immediate future, and too many\r\npeople continue to pass their lives with little or no hope.\r\nIndonesia recognizes that the primary responsibility\r\nfor social development is at the national level. And\r\ndeveloping countries are doing what they can with what\r\nthey have. But we cannot accept that the developing\r\ncountries are to undertake significant measures — let\r\nalone achieve the Summit’s goals — with their hands\r\ntied. Only when the international economic situation is\r\nconducive to development and international cooperation\r\nfor development strengthened will the developing\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ncountries be in a realistic position to achieve any\r\nmeaningful and lasting progress.\r\nA new compact for international development needs to\r\nbe pursued, based on the spirit of partnership and\r\ncooperation. And I would not hesitate to add that any\r\nefforts within the United Nations should be geared toward\r\nsupporting such a partnership, with a view to making the\r\nUnited Nations more responsive to poverty-alleviation\r\nactivities. However, I would also caution that any deviation\r\nfrom such a course must be avoided.\r\nAt the same time, it is urgent and absolutely necessary\r\nfor the international community to take action to solve the\r\ndebt burdens of the developing countries. The recent\r\nproposal of the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund to address the indebtedness of the heavily indebted\r\npoor countries is a welcome step, although it will require\r\nmodification to remove its restrictive aspects. The poverty\r\nand destitution of a country should not be made an occasion\r\nfor forcing on it alien values nor for making judgments that\r\nbear little or no relation to development.\r\nFurthermore, the agreed official development\r\nassistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product of\r\nthe developed countries must be fulfilled at the earliest\r\npossible time. And we still await a multilateral trading\r\nsystem that is equitable, transparent and rule-based, in\r\naccordance with the conclusions of the Uruguay Round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations.\r\nDuring this session of the General Assembly we need\r\nto move forward vigorously on the agreed conclusions\r\n1996/1 adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its\r\ncoordination segment. Those conclusions support the efforts\r\nof the Member States to implement their global goals and\r\ncommitments in the field of poverty alleviation made at\r\nseveral international conferences, in particular at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. The General Assembly\r\nshould, moreover, provide the necessary guidance to ensure\r\nthat the entire United Nations system, including the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, works cohesively to implement the\r\nconclusions and undertakes substantive follow-up to the\r\nSummit.\r\nAlthough the special session of the General Assembly\r\nto review the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development is still four years away, it\r\nis important to closely monitor both the progress on and the\r\nobstacles to the implementation of the agreements reached\r\nat the Summit, as well as the coordination efforts outlined\r\nin resolution S-1996/1. In this regard, the revitalized\r\nCommission for Social Development has ample room to\r\nplay a role.\r\nIndonesia has been active in addressing its own\r\nproblems of poverty, unemployment and social\r\nintegration. In 1970, 60 per cent of our population — 70\r\nmillion people — were poor. By 1993, after considerable\r\nefforts by the Government to improve the economic\r\nsituation, the number of poor had declined to 25.9 million\r\npeople, or only 13.7 per cent. And during that same time,\r\nthe population in Indonesia increased by 73 million. Our\r\ngoal now is to reduce the numbers of poor, especially the\r\nabsolute poor, by 12 million people. One means being\r\nemployed is what we term the IDT Programme, or\r\nfinancial assistance under presidential instruction. The\r\nIDT channels small amounts of seed capital to less\r\ndeveloped villages, providing local communities with\r\ninput into programme development and implementation.\r\nThe people themselves become empowered to contribute\r\nto development, for it is they who will reap the benefits.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline the central\r\nimportance for the international community to respond\r\neffectively and cohesively to meeting the expectations\r\nraised at Copenhagen. For although each nation must bear\r\nresponsibility for improving its socio-economic situation,\r\nproblems of a global nature demand global solutions.\r\nWith all certainty, to ignore the plight of the poorest\r\namong us and to become lax in the follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development is to hamper\r\nfuture progress and prosperity for all humanity.\r\nMr. Jayanama (Thailand): The Thai delegation\r\nwould like to associate itself with the important statement\r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Costa Rica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. Thailand would also\r\nlike to express its support for the Ministerial Declaration\r\nadopted at the Twentieth Annual Ministerial Meeting of\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nWe would also like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nWe wish to draw particular attention to the role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP), as mentioned in the report. ESCAP can\r\nplay an important role in enhancing regional cooperation\r\nand in achieving the outcomes of the Summit through\r\nmeans such as the proposed regional ministerial\r\nconference on social development in 1997 to review\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nprogress in the implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action.\r\nIt was acknowledged last year in Copenhagen that\r\n“the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out\r\nin the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction rested with national Governments”. (A/51/348,\r\npara. 11)\r\nThis sentiment was further emphasized by the adoption of\r\nresolution 50/161 in 1995, wherein the General Assembly\r\nproclaimed the critical importance of national action for\r\nsocial development. Thailand is in full accord with this\r\nview and has undertaken a concerted effort to realize these\r\ngoals within our country in order to address such social ills\r\nas poverty, drug abuse, disease and hunger, which —\r\ndespite our considerable success in national economic and\r\nsocial development — continue to bring suffering to\r\npeople’s lives.\r\nIn the implementation and monitoring of the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action of the Summit, the\r\nGovernment of Thailand has designated the Office of the\r\nNational Economic and Social Development Board as the\r\nfocal point. Thailand’s eighth five-year national, economic\r\nand social development plan, which commenced on 1\r\nOctober of this year, is consistent with the goals of the\r\nSummit and also integrates the recommendations of the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women. The plan is a people-\r\ncentred development plan in which economic development\r\nis to be regarded as a means and not as an end in national\r\ndevelopment. Its single objective is human-centred\r\ndevelopment, and it has adopted the human development\r\nindex as the means of setting development targets.\r\nThe plan aims to empower the Thai people to solve\r\nproblems by themselves by enabling them to upgrade their\r\ncapabilities, wisdom and ethics. It also marks the first time\r\nin Thai history that people from all professions have been\r\ninvited to participate in the development planning process.\r\nTowards achieving the three main objectives of the\r\nSummit — the eradication of poverty, the enhancement of\r\nproductive employment and social integration — our eighth\r\nnational development plan has mapped out three\r\ncorresponding strategies.\r\nThe first strategy is to strengthen the national economy\r\nby promoting equitable income distribution and improving\r\nthe quality of life of the Thai people. This strategy will\r\nhelp eradicate poverty and enhance productive employment.\r\nTo achieve this first strategy, the Government has\r\nimplemented an overall economic policy aimed at\r\nachieving stability and employment-generation. Rural\r\ndevelopment and prosperity-decentralization in the region\r\nhave been expedited by building up economic and social\r\nbasic services to catalyse sustainable rural development\r\nand by expanding the quality and quantity of basic\r\nservices to meet the local demands of the country.\r\nMoreover, the public sector’s continued investment in\r\ninfrastructure and social services has contributed to the\r\nrise of income and the improvement of the status and\r\nquality of life of the Thai people. It is also important to\r\nnote that the Government encourages measures to\r\nintegrate economic development that is environmentally\r\nsound.\r\nThe second strategy aims to promote social\r\nintegration and social justice by encouraging popular\r\nparticipation and by upgrading the potential of people of\r\nall ages and of both genders. The measures under this\r\nstrategy include the adjustment of the learning and\r\ntraining processes in order to enable people to think\r\nconceptually and work practically; upgrading the potential\r\nand capability of the underprivileged to earn more income\r\nand rely on themselves, so as to bridge the disparities in\r\nincome; the encouragement of spiritual development,\r\nemphasizing good deeds, self-discipline and ethics; and\r\nthe development and improvement of the existing social-\r\ninsurance system to reach various target groups.\r\nThis strategy also seeks to strengthen family and\r\ncommunity institutions in order to increase their role and\r\nparticipation in the development of the economy, society,\r\nculture, environment, politics and administration. It seeks\r\nto enhance the role of women to be a driving force in\r\nnational development and to participate actively in the\r\ndecision-making process for the sake of integrated and\r\nbalanced development. It also seeks to create a supportive\r\nand favourable environment for youth and juvenile\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe third strategy is aimed at developing our\r\nnational administration in the implementation of our\r\nnational plan. This strategy provides for clearer measures\r\naimed at enhancing the participation of the private sector\r\nin national development, building up the capacity of the\r\nmass media to advocate national development, creating\r\ncommon understanding among relevant parties from the\r\ntop-down to bottom-up planning system, and setting\r\nclearer methodologies, under joint programmes, for\r\ngovernment- service reforms.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nThailand believes that, by achieving the goals of the\r\neighth national development plan, it will also be able to\r\nachieve the goals of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nAlthough the Human Development Report of 1996\r\nrecognizes Thailand as being among those countries which\r\nhave a high rate of human development, despite modest per\r\ncapita income, we recognize that we must not become\r\ncomplacent, but must press ever forward. Thailand is firmly\r\ncommitted to fulfilling the noble goals of the World\r\nSummit for Development and to taking all necessary\r\nmeasures to develop the potential of our people to the\r\nfullest, in order to ensure their full participation in building\r\na society for all.\r\nAmong other measures undertaken, perhaps the most\r\nimportant is that we have committed to decreasing the\r\nproportion of the poor per total population to less than\r\n10 per cent by the next millennium.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): Malta associates itself with the\r\nstatement delivered earlier by the delegation of Ireland on\r\nbehalf of the European Union.\r\nThe delegation of Malta welcomes the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development, contained in\r\ndocument A/51/348 of 18 September 1996.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution\r\n50/161 of 22 December 1995, acknowledges that the\r\nprincipal duty for the attainment of the goals set rests with\r\nthe national Governments. Also proclaimed is the critical\r\nimportance of the cooperation, support and contributions of\r\nthe international community, the United Nations, the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions, all regional organizations\r\nand local authorities, and all actors of civil society —\r\nincluding private citizens — for social development.\r\nBy the same resolution, the General Assembly\r\nmandated the Commission for Social Development, on\r\nwhich Malta is honoured to serve, with the primary\r\nresponsibility for the follow-up to and review of the\r\nimplementation of the Summit; it also mandated the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to provide overall guidance\r\nand coordination.\r\nMy delegation commends the action taken so far by\r\nthe Commission for Social Development, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, other functional committees and the United\r\nNations Secretariat, funds, programmes and specialized\r\nagencies.\r\nMy Government’s programme of action to follow up\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development is based on a\r\nnumber of principled criteria.\r\nSocial justice is guaranteed by giving particular\r\nattention to the more vulnerable members of society.\r\nThe provision of both social security and social\r\nwelfare continue and is enhanced. The former ensures\r\nmaterial sustenance; the latter is essentially concerned\r\nwith non-material aspects of support from the community\r\nto all persons, particularly those suffering from forms of\r\npsychological, cultural or material deprivation.\r\nSocial services should aim at a more personal and\r\nfamily-centred focus. While it is the general intention to\r\norganize and channel welfare services as much as possible\r\nthrough the family, it is recognized that this has to be\r\ndone as a function of individual needs and personalities\r\nand according to the choice of each member of the\r\nfamily.\r\nIndividuals should not become passive recipients of\r\nassistance, but ought to be encouraged to participate\r\nactively in helping themselves, and eventually others, in\r\nsafeguarding their well-being. Every person should be\r\nable to benefit from and contribute to the spirit of\r\nsolidarity, the reciprocal concern between all the members\r\nof society thus being underlined. Services need not be\r\ndirectly provided by the State, but are often better\r\nprovided through other agencies. Consequently,\r\ngovernment and non-governmental agencies are to\r\ncomplement each other.\r\nThese principled criteria which guide my\r\nGovernment are based on a vision that places the human\r\nperson and the family at the very centre of social\r\ndevelopment. Following these principled criteria, the\r\nGovernment of Malta has over the past years enacted\r\nlegislative measures to buttress social security,\r\nemployment without discrimination, the equal status of\r\nwomen and the provision of equal and universal\r\nopportunity and access to free education at all levels, as\r\nwell as the whole range of health services and social\r\nhousing. In the case of employment, special provisions\r\nhave been made for the disabled, single parents and\r\nmarginalized or disadvantaged groups, including\r\nrehabilitated drug abusers and former prison inmates.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nResources have been made available so that welfare\r\nservices could operate efficiently. An institute for social\r\nwork has been established within the University of Malta to\r\nprovide for the training of social workers in the preventive,\r\nrehabilitative and reintegrative social work connected with\r\nthe family, youth, the elderly, the disabled, abusers of drugs\r\nand alcohol and victims of domestic violence.\r\nMalta has also established national commissions with\r\nspecialized mandates. These include commissions on youth,\r\nthe elderly, the disabled, the advancement of women and on\r\ncombating the illicit use of drugs. Civil society is strongly\r\nrepresented on and is considered an essential component of\r\nthese commissions.\r\nMalta is fortunate to have a strong sense of\r\ncommitment ingrained in its people and in having an active\r\nbody of volunteers working under the guidance of several\r\nnon-governmental organizations. The role of the Catholic\r\nChurch in this sphere is of particular significance in the\r\ndevelopment of awareness and the provision of a wide\r\nrange of services to the community. These\r\nnon-governmental organizations — many of which are\r\npioneers in social work in Malta — today continue to play\r\na significant role in conjunction with the Government in the\r\nprovision of psychological, social and material support to\r\nthose most in need.\r\nThese principled criteria and the strategy adopted\r\nunderline the need to strengthen social justice in ways other\r\nthan purely financial. They provide and sustain a more\r\ncaring attitude among citizens, as they reciprocally share\r\nproblems and benefits. The common good and the well-\r\nbeing of communities at the local or national levels is as\r\ndependent on awareness at the personal and social level as\r\nit is on commitment and engagement.\r\nOur commitment to ensuring social justice and our\r\npromotion and protection of human rights, fundamental\r\nfreedoms and the rule of law are the supporting columns of\r\nthat bridge which should lead us into the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): I would first like to\r\nassociate myself with the statement the representative of\r\nCosta Rica made on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe Philippine delegation also commends the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the item under\r\ndiscussion.\r\nEarly in the spring of 1995, we were witnesses to a\r\nmost historic event. One hundred and eighteen Heads of\r\nState and Government gathered in Copenhagen to address\r\nthe problems of poverty, unemployment and social\r\ndisintegration.\r\nThe cold war had ended and there was a promise of\r\ngreater and closer international cooperation to achieve\r\nhigher living standards and improved social conditions, a\r\nprocess that would hopefully lead to the empowerment of\r\nthe individual. Unrelenting poverty, especially among\r\ndebt-strapped countries, widespread and worsening\r\nunemployment, a deepening environmental crisis and a\r\ngrowing technological and economic gap between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries had focused attention\r\non the plight of the human person. It became increasingly\r\nclear that people and their needs were both the reason for\r\nand the beneficiaries of development.\r\nTowards this end, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment sought to secure international and country-\r\nspecific commitments and time-bound goals and targets\r\nfor reducing overall poverty, eradicating absolute poverty,\r\nexpanding productive employment and enhancing social\r\nintegration. The special concerns of marginalized and\r\ndisadvantaged groups were given recognition that went\r\nbeyond the pale with politics.\r\nThe role of non-governmental organizations and civil\r\nsociety in nation-building and in the empowerment of\r\npeople was recognized, and their participation in the\r\nfollow-up to the Summit was encouraged.\r\nIt is a source of pride and gratification to my\r\nGovernment that during this historic event and its\r\npreparatory process, the Philippines had the privilege of\r\nserving as Chair of the Group of 77 and China. The\r\nPhilippines has also been closely involved with the\r\nimplementation phase of the Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action of the World Summit for Social Development\r\nin its capacity as Vice-Chair of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development and as Chair of the working group\r\nthat worked on the framework for the follow-up process.\r\nThe Philippines has also been involved in the functioning\r\nof the Commission itself, in the monitoring, review and\r\nappraisal of implementation efforts.\r\nShortly after the Copenhagen Summit, the\r\nPhilippines began to undertake various measures to\r\nimplement fully its commitments. Most notably, the\r\nPhilippine Government created the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development Multisectoral Committee, in order to\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ncoordinate fully its efforts in this regard. It is composed of\r\nrepresentatives from government, non-governmental\r\norganizations, people’s organizations and other concerned\r\ngroups.\r\nThis year, the mandate of this Committee was\r\nexpanded to cover the recent round of other international\r\nhuman development conferences held at Cairo, Beijing and\r\nIstanbul. It was therefore renamed the Multisectoral\r\nCommittee on International Human Development\r\nCommitments. This Committee will serve as a coordinating\r\nbody that will harmonize all follow-up activities resulting\r\nfrom the international human development conferences.\r\nThe efforts of the Philippines to improve the human\r\ndevelopment goals and aspirations of its people are focused\r\non poverty alleviation, employment expansion and social\r\nintegration. These concerns are addressed by our Social\r\nReform Agenda through its three-point agenda: access to\r\nquality basic services; access to productive resources and\r\nasset reforms; and institution-building and participation in\r\ngovernance. The Social Reform Agenda pursues a\r\nconvergence strategy which emphasizes services to\r\nvulnerable sectors of society, such as the small farmers,\r\nfisherfolk, indigenous people, workers in the informal\r\nsector, the urban poor, disadvantaged women, youth, senior\r\ncitizens, persons with disabilities and victims of disasters.\r\nAt the core of the Social Reform Agenda strategy is\r\nthe minimum basic needs approach, which aims to meet the\r\nsurvival, security and enabling needs of needy households.\r\nOn top of this approach, the Social Reform Agenda has\r\nadopted basic reform commitments addressing the specific\r\nneeds of the sectors for greater access to productive assets,\r\nfor example, post-harvest facilities for farmers.\r\nOn employment expansion, the Philippine Government\r\nhas embarked upon a Comprehensive Employment Strategy\r\nProgramme, which emphasizes employment-generation, the\r\npromotion of labour welfare, and human resource\r\ndevelopment focused on providing skills for productive\r\nemployment. To strengthen social integration, the\r\ncomposition of the Social Reform Council was expanded to\r\ninclude representatives from basic organized labour,\r\nbusiness and non-governmental organization sectors.\r\nMoreover, sectoral representatives were appointed by the\r\nPhilippine President to the Philippine Congress.\r\nFor the elderly, the President signed into law the\r\nSenior Citizens Act, which seeks to establish senior citizen\r\ncentres in every municipality and city, and which provides\r\ncertain privileges for low-income elderly persons. Likewise\r\npassed into law was the Magna Carta for Disabled\r\nPersons, which provides for rehabilitation, self-\r\ndevelopment and self-reliance for persons with disabilities\r\nand for their integration into the mainstream of society.\r\nOn the issue of youth, the National Youth Commission\r\nwas created to coordinate youth programmes in the\r\ncountry.\r\nWe wish to state that the Philippines is well on its\r\nway towards implementing its commitments with respect\r\nto the 20/20 initiative. This is indicated by the\r\nencouraging increase in the percentage of national\r\nGovernment resources and official development assistance\r\nmobilized for priority social programmes over the past\r\nfew years. At the domestic level, local government units\r\nare being encouraged to increase spending on human\r\ndevelopment priorities. Such local efforts are needed to\r\ncomplement resource mobilization at the national level. In\r\nthis connection, we were glad to hear from the\r\nrepresentative of Norway of the successful outcome of the\r\nOslo consensus on the 20/20 initiative.\r\nAt this point, we wish to state that there is a need to\r\nemphasize efforts at the international level for mobilizing\r\nresources to implement fully the commitments reached at\r\nCopenhagen. It is our earnest hope that the momentum\r\nreached at the World Summit for Social Development will\r\nbe sustained in the years to come. In Copenhagen, we\r\nachieved a common acceptance of human equality and\r\nhuman dignity as the framework upon which to build a\r\nfuture where each person will be vested with the right to\r\nthe enjoyment of basic human needs, as well as the\r\nopportunity and capacity to develop his or her potential to\r\nthe fullest. Now, the bigger task of realizing this is at\r\nhand.\r\nWhile some decisions have been made with regard\r\nto the mechanisms for the implementation of Copenhagen,\r\nas was done during the special session of the Commission\r\nfor Social Development, one has yet to see a concrete\r\nproposal on resources: the necessary wherewithal to\r\nimplement the Programme of Action.\r\nAs we draw closer to the end of the millennium,\r\nwhen we shall meet again in this very Hall to take stock\r\nof what we have accomplished or have failed to\r\naccomplish in the interim, we shall need more than\r\npromises in order that we shall not be found wanting.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Vietnam): Let me first\r\nexpress a note of high appreciation for the exemplary way\r\nAmbassador Razali has been presiding over the work of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. This\r\ndemonstrates a deep sense of responsibility and also\r\nconstitutes a substantial contribution, in practical terms, to\r\nthe Organization at this difficult time.\r\nIt has been over a year and a half since our leaders\r\nmet at Copenhagen to highlight the significance of social\r\ndevelopment for human well-being. Together, they solemnly\r\nmade a universal commitment to social development with\r\na far-reaching vision.\r\nAt this session we are to look back and take stock of\r\nthe developments and progress made so far and devise the\r\nnext steps to implement further and follow up the\r\nCopenhagen commitments. We note with satisfaction that\r\nthe question of social development has since then been\r\ngenerally accorded a higher priority on both the\r\ninternational and the national agendas. Efforts have been\r\nmade to tackle issues embodied in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action — such as poverty\r\neradication, productive employment and social\r\nintegration — as essential to economic and social\r\ndevelopment for every country and for the world as a\r\nwhole.\r\nOn the basis of Copenhagen and as suited to their\r\nspecific conditions, countries have initiated their national\r\nprogrammes of action and achieved initial results. The\r\nUnited Nations, its specialized agencies and international\r\nfinancial institutions have contributed their part in the\r\nimplementation of activities and programmes at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. The Commission\r\nfor Social Development has also carried out meaningful\r\nwork this year in this regard.\r\nMy delegation highly appreciates the comprehensive\r\nanalysis presented by the representative of Costa Rica,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, on the\r\nquestion of social development.\r\nIn reviewing the 18-month follow-up of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit, I shall focus on two concrete issues\r\nwhich, in the view of my delegation, are of the utmost\r\nimportance, especially to the people of developing countries\r\nwho make up the majority of the world’s population. Those\r\nissues are an enabling international environment and the\r\nalleviation of poverty and hunger.\r\nIn today’s world of ever-increasing interdependence,\r\ninternational support and multilateral cooperation have not\r\nonly been helpful; they have been indispensable. Given the\r\nnumerous global challenges to our survival that must be\r\nmet, they are particularly indispensable for the countries\r\nof both the North and the South. For social development\r\nwe need peace and we need efforts and actions at both\r\nnational and international levels. However, there are still\r\nconflicts that divert the energy and resources needed for\r\ndevelopment, and they must be resolved. There are still\r\nconstraints and unavoidable extraneous conditions that\r\nhamper our common efforts and restrict our cooperation\r\nfor the betterment of mankind in each and every country.\r\nIn addition, the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national product for official development assistance\r\nis ever farther out of reach. The past two years have\r\nwitnessed a trend towards continued reduction in the\r\nprovision of development aid. The greatest sufferers from\r\nthis situation are the developing countries.\r\nAs was recognized at Copenhagen, social\r\ndevelopment is an integral part of and the result of many\r\nrelated issues and must be pursued as a component of an\r\noverall development strategy. In addition, the human\r\nperson has been placed at the centre of development. Yet\r\nhunger and poverty remain an acute problem in our\r\nworld. More than one fifth of the world’s population is\r\nnow living in conditions of absolute poverty, lacking the\r\nmost essential means necessary for daily survival — food,\r\nclean water and sanitation. Many developing countries\r\nmust overcome this critical situation of poverty and\r\nhunger before they can enjoy the fruits of social\r\ndevelopment. In this respect, we express our hope that the\r\noutcome of the World Conference on Food Security will\r\nhelp in the alleviation of hunger and poverty, especially\r\nfor those in the most difficulty.\r\nIn the light of the above situation, we, together with\r\nother delegations, call for a renewed and greater\r\ncommitment to multilateralism and international\r\ncooperation based on genuine partnership and mutual\r\nbenefit. More resources need to be mobilized to support\r\nthe countries of the South in their efforts to overcome\r\ndifficulties. In this context, the United Nations needs to\r\nplay a more active role. We therefore urge that the\r\nAgenda for Development now under consideration be\r\nadopted as soon as possible. That will be beneficial to our\r\ncommon cause of social development.\r\nSince Copenhagen, Viet Nam has made great efforts\r\nto implement the Summit’s Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action. In line with our commitments at Copenhagen,\r\na national programme of action has been developed.\r\nPriorities have been set and measures to allocate energy\r\nand resources to achieve them have been adopted and\r\ncarried out. These strategies have been included as an\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nintegral part of the country’s overall renewed policy for\r\neconomic and social development towards the goal of\r\nbuilding a Viet Nam with a prosperous people, a strong\r\ncountry and a just and civilized society. We have achieved\r\nsignificant results in many fields, providing the people with\r\nbetter living conditions.\r\nIn the pursuit of social development in Viet Nam, as\r\nin many other developing countries, the alleviation of\r\npoverty and hunger remains a critical problem. This issue\r\nis high on our national agenda. We recognize that economic\r\ngrowth is important but that it is not the sole factor in\r\neradicating hunger and poverty. Hunger and poverty have\r\nmultiple causes that must be dealt with in the broader\r\ncontext of economic and social development as a first and\r\nnecessary step.\r\nThus, a nation-wide programme for hunger eradication\r\nand poverty alleviation has been launched, and we have\r\nresponded actively to the International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty, 1996. I would like to share some of\r\nour experiences in this connection.\r\nThe main focus of the programme for hunger\r\neradication and poverty alleviation is the creation of\r\nopportunities for the poor to increase their incomes and\r\nimprove their standards of living, and not merely a means\r\nof social relief. It is a comprehensive programme that\r\nranges from helping the poor with capital for income\r\ngeneration to policies for education, training, health care,\r\ninfrastructure building and so on. Almost all provinces and\r\ncities have established and implemented programmes for\r\nhunger and poverty alleviation. Resources and funds have\r\nbeen mobilized through a joint venture between the State,\r\nlocal government and the people.\r\nA Bank for the Poor, with an initial capital equivalent\r\nto $45 million, has been established to make credit funds\r\naccessible to poor households and to help them in their\r\nproductive activities. The Bank is a non-profit institution\r\nthat provides the poor with direct preferential credit, and it\r\nhas branches in all the country’s 53 provinces and cities.\r\nWe have also developed various cooperation\r\nprogrammes for hunger and poverty alleviation with\r\nassistance from other Governments, from such international\r\norganizations as the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),\r\nthe World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the\r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),\r\nand from non-governmental organizations. In May 1996,\r\nthe Government of Viet Nam, in coordination with\r\nUNDP, organized an international workshop on this\r\nsubject. We also participated in the Indo-China conference\r\non hunger and poverty held at Bangkok from 22 to 24\r\nJuly 1996.\r\nWe support the proposal that this item be considered\r\nat the General Assembly’s session each year until the year\r\n2000, when a special session will be held for an overall\r\nreview, assessment and appraisal of the programmes and\r\nactivities undertaken to implement the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. That will provide\r\nus with opportunities to exchange experiences and work\r\ntogether to advance faster towards the fulfilment of the\r\ncommitments we entered into at the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): More than a year has\r\npassed since the World Summit for Social Development,\r\na forum that determined the strategy for future world\r\nsocial development. The Copenhagen Programme of\r\nAction is a rich source of ideas and practical\r\nrecommendations that can be helpful for national\r\nstrategies and programmes aimed at achieving specific\r\ngoals in the field of social development, taking due\r\naccount of national conditions, traditions and priorities.\r\nIn our view, the spirit of the agreements reached at\r\nthe Summit reflects the sense of solidarity within and\r\namong nations and their intention to curb the acute social\r\nproblems being faced by many countries. Once considered\r\nan exclusive responsibility of national Governments, such\r\nproblems are now of a global scale and hence require\r\nglobal attention.\r\nAlthough the global conferences held earlier in this\r\ndecade drew the attention of the world community in\r\nvarious ways to the problems of social development, we\r\nagree with speakers who have concluded that the social\r\nSummit at Copenhagen absorbed all the trends in world\r\nsocial development and dealt with all societies,\r\nhighlighting the interdependence and the universality of\r\nour world.\r\nAll countries, irrespective of their geographical\r\nlocation, experience the need for social development and\r\nintegration. This is also true for Ukraine and other newly\r\nindependent States, for which the transition from one\r\nsocio-economic system to another, and from a totalitarian\r\nsystem of government to real democracy, has turned out\r\nto be a more complex and protracted challenge than was\r\nimagined at the outset. The implementation of\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ncomprehensive, radical political reforms and the\r\nintroduction of a socially oriented market economy are the\r\ntwo key elements on which Ukraine is focusing its new\r\neconomic strategy in present-day conditions.\r\nUkraine’s participation in the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment at the presidential level was of special\r\nimportance for us, and that is why the Government is\r\ntaking specific social measures to apply the Summit’s\r\nrecommendations in its domestic policies.\r\nIn a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General in\r\nMarch of this year, the President of Ukraine outlined the\r\nmeasures undertaken at the national level in following up\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development. One of the\r\nmajor practical steps was the recent approval of the main\r\ndirection of the activities of the State executive power of\r\nUkraine in the implementation of the final documents of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development.\r\nTaking into account the proclamation by the United\r\nNations of the year 1996 as the International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty, Ukraine has also elaborated a\r\nspecific national plan of activities for the Year, which is\r\ncurrently under way.\r\nAs a new member of the Council of Europe, Ukraine\r\nis making every effort to meet the exceptional demands of\r\nthis authoritative body in social and economic matters, in\r\nparticular with regard to social policy, social security,\r\nemployment, demography and migration.\r\nYesterday, at the 35th plenary meeting, our delegation\r\ninformed the General Assembly about some of the\r\nmeasures that the Government of Ukraine is undertaking to\r\ncreate favourable conditions for the general development of\r\nchildren. A number of other programmes in the social field\r\nare also being launched, among them the long-term\r\nprogramme on the advancement of women and the family,\r\nthe programme for the protection of maternity and children,\r\nthe education programme, the national family-planning\r\nprogramme, the integrated programme on the problems of\r\nthe disabled and others.\r\nIt is the view of our delegation, that the report of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General (A/51/348) gives an\r\nexhaustive picture of the work done in implementing the\r\nCopenhagen Programme of Action endorsed by the General\r\nAssembly in its resolution 50/161. We note with\r\nsatisfaction the efforts undertaken to establish a reliable\r\nmechanism to ensure the Summit follow-up. The delegation\r\nof Ukraine considers that this mechanism creates a reliable\r\nbasis for coordinating United Nations activities in the\r\nimplementation of the decisions of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit. A series of international conferences and\r\nmeetings for social progress, held in France, Norway and\r\nChile, and the preparation of a series of seminars to be\r\nheld in Denmark will also serve that end. The initiative of\r\nAustria to convene a European regional meeting in 1997\r\nto review the progress made towards fulfilling the\r\ncommitments entered into at the Summit has our full\r\nsupport.\r\nIn this connection, our delegation takes note of the\r\nresults of the special session of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development held in May of this year, which\r\nadopted a multi-year programme of work within the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action\r\nand came up with recommendations on the coordination\r\nof the activities within the United Nations system for the\r\neradication of poverty.\r\nWe believe that adoption of agreed conclusions\r\n1996/1 on the role of the United Nations in the overall\r\neffort for the eradication of poverty and in assisting\r\nMember States to translate the global goals and\r\ncommitments of international conferences and the\r\nstatutory mandates of each organization into concrete\r\nactions and activities at all levels should promote\r\ncoordination and strengthen the role of the Organization.\r\nln general, we consider that a year after the World\r\nSummit we have the necessary mechanisms that can help\r\nus to implement the decisions of that important forum.\r\nWe therefore hope that the special session of the General\r\nAssembly to be held in the year 2000 will review our\r\nfive-year joint efforts with a special view to evaluating\r\nthe capability of the Organization to solve the global\r\nsocial problems facing the international community.\r\nMr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): I have the honour to\r\naddress the Assembly on agenda item 45,\r\n“Implementation of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment”, on behalf of the States members of the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC):\r\nAngola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,\r\nMozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,\r\nTanzania, Zambia and my own country, Zimbabwe. We\r\nwould like first of all to endorse the statement made by\r\nCosta Rica as Chairman of the Group of 77.\r\nI should like to express my region’s appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his informative report on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\nSocial Development (A/51/348). We have found the report\r\nuseful in providing us with an indication of what the United\r\nNations is doing with regard to follow-up activities.\r\nWith the decline of conflicts within our region, the\r\nSADC member States are now beginning to concentrate\r\nseriously on economic and social-development issues. With\r\nregard to the implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, the member States\r\nhave set up focal points that will be responsible for the\r\nnational follow-up of the Summit goals.\r\nAt the World Summit for Social Development at\r\nCopenhagen our Heads of State and Government committed\r\nthemselves to the goal of eradicating poverty, expanding\r\nproductive sectors, creating employment, and creating a\r\nfavourable and enabling environment for world economic\r\nrecovery and growth through decisive international and\r\nnational action. That commitment was the result of the\r\nrealization that social development was an ethical, political\r\nand economic imperative for humankind. The Summit\r\nreaffirmed rights relating to education, food, shelter and\r\nemployment. The Summit also identified the goals of the\r\npromotion of full employment and social integration. The\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted at\r\nCopenhagen provided the international community with a\r\npragmatic and viable framework for advancing the social\r\ndevelopment and well-being of all peoples, as enunciated in\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nNotwithstanding the international commitment to rid\r\nthe world of those social ills, we have yet to see a concrete\r\nfinancial commitment to change rhetoric into the realization\r\nof set targets. The socio-economic gains that have been\r\nmade in recent years have yet to have a significant impact\r\non the daily lives of men, women and children. Over one\r\nbillion people live in absolute poverty, and 67,000 join the\r\nranks of the poor each day. We see poverty eradication as\r\nbeing at the very core of the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the social Summit; this was aptly summed up\r\nby President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania in his address to\r\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. He said:\r\n“Unless the issue of poverty is addressed\r\ncomprehensively, we cannot achieve meaningful and\r\nenduring peace.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fifty-First Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n22nd meeting, p. 2)\r\nPoverty is a denial of human rights, and we cannot have\r\nfull democracy amidst absolute poverty and social injustice.\r\nIn this context, we believe that the Copenhagen\r\nProgramme of Action reflects the determination of the\r\ninternational community to address the problem of social\r\ninjustice and its attendant ills. The full implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the world social Summit requires the\r\ncooperation of developed and developing countries. There\r\nmust be the requisite political will to ensure that the\r\nCopenhagen document is not relegated to the shelves of\r\nthe archives. The momentum generated by the world\r\nsocial Summit must not be allowed to dissipate into\r\nnothingness.\r\nWhile we agree with the view that the\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen Programme of Action\r\nis primarily the responsibility of each national\r\nGovernment, it is undeniable that developing countries,\r\nespecially those in Africa, are encountering\r\ninsurmountable difficulties in reallocating already\r\noverstretched budgets to finance follow-up activities. The\r\nincreasing disparities and instability that characterize the\r\ninternational economic system offer bleak development\r\nprospects to most African countries, making it difficult to\r\nmarshal the necessary resources for social development.\r\nWe continue to struggle with the overwhelming problems\r\nof ponderous debt burdens, trade barriers and other forms\r\nof protectionism, low commodity prices and onerous\r\nstructural adjustment programmes. National social\r\nintegration programmes cannot be sustained without\r\ninternational solidarity. Social disintegration is a threat to\r\npeace both within and between nations. Social\r\ndevelopment should therefore be on a global scale. There\r\nis an urgent need for international cooperation in\r\nstrengthening the institutional capacity of developing\r\ncountries to implement the Summit goals.\r\nThe implementation of the 20/20 compact would go\r\na long way towards achieving the goals of the world\r\nsocial Summit. The SADC subregion, my subregion, has\r\nembraced the 20/20 compact, convinced as it is that it is\r\nvital for the provision of social safety nets in the quest for\r\nsocial development. We realize that the 20/20 compact\r\nwas agreed upon on a voluntary basis, but we feel that\r\nthe global implementation of the compact would enable\r\ndeveloping countries to integrate the socially excluded\r\ngroups.\r\nWhile we acknowledge with appreciation that some\r\ndeveloped countries have attained the target of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product for overall official\r\ndevelopment assistance, we note with great concern that\r\nthe target has not been reached by many of our developed\r\npartners and that in fact the level is regrettably on the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 16 October 1996\r\ndecline. We call on our development partners to honour the\r\ncommitment they made at Copenhagen.\r\nWith regard to trade, it has been recognized that the\r\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements will have\r\nan initial negative impact on developing countries,\r\nespecially the net food importers. In this context, measures\r\nshould be taken to mitigate those negative effects, in\r\nparticular the loss of markets and competitiveness. At\r\nCopenhagen, we agreed to ensure the establishment of an\r\nenabling economic environment and that an exercise to\r\noffset the negative consequences of the Uruguay Round\r\nagreements would be an essential part of the setting up of\r\nthat environment.\r\nThe debt crisis is a major obstacle, not only to\r\neconomic growth but also to the provision of essential\r\nsocial services in most countries in our region. We agreed\r\nat Copenhagen that the objective was indeed to reduce debt\r\nto sustainable levels. In fact, we believe that there has to be\r\na serious effort at debt cancellation for Africa, the continent\r\nwith largest number of least developed countries. That\r\ninitiative has to entail the participation and commitment of\r\ninternational financial institutions, particularly the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, the Paris Club and other multilateral\r\ncreditors. We welcome the launching of the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa and hope that it\r\nwill give a fillip to the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s and deal\r\ncomprehensively with the problem of African development.\r\nThe United Nations should play a greater role in\r\npromoting the effective implementation of the Summit’s\r\nProgramme of Action. We acknowledge that the United\r\nNations system has undertaken some important initial\r\nsteps to facilitate the implementation of the Summit goals.\r\nWe welcome the setting up of the inter-agency task\r\nforces, which are meant to assist Governments and\r\nnational institutions in implementing Summit\r\ncommitments. The recent establishment of an Inter-\r\nAgency Committee on Women with the responsibility of\r\naddressing, on a system-wide basis, all aspects of the\r\nBeijing Conference, is a far-sighted development on the\r\npart of the United Nations system, and we welcome it.\r\nI wish to conclude my remarks by noting that\r\nalthough various types of machinery have been put in\r\nplace, there is no mention of the necessary resources to\r\nstart the process going. There should be a coordinated\r\neffort to mobilize financial resources if we are to move\r\nfrom sheer rhetoric to implementation.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe President: Tomorrow morning, as already\r\nannounced, remaining speakers in the debate on agenda\r\nitem 98 will be heard first.\r\nTomorrow morning, the Assembly will also take up\r\nthree reports of the Fifth Committee: on agenda item 126,\r\nentitled “Financing of the United Nations Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara”; on agenda item 133,\r\nentitled “Financing of the United Nations Observer\r\nMission in Georgia”; and on agenda item 135, entitled\r\n“Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nLiberia”.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
