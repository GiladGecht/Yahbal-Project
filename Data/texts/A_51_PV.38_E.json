(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 98 (continued)\r\nOperational activities for development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the progress at\r\nmid-decade on the implementation of General\r\nAssembly resolution 45/217 on the World Summit\r\nfor Children (A/51/256)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform the Assembly\r\nthat the representative of Uganda has requested to\r\nparticipate in the debate on this item.\r\nInasmuch as the list of speakers was closed on\r\nTuesday, 15 October, at 4 p.m., may I ask the Assembly\r\nwhether there is any objection to the inclusion of this\r\ndelegation in the list of speakers?\r\nThere being no objection, Uganda is included in the\r\nlist.\r\nMr. Ruiz Pérez (Colombia): I wish to begin by\r\nexpressing, on behalf of the Government and the delegation\r\nof Colombia, solidarity and deepest sympathy to the\r\nbeloved fraternal Republic of Guatemala at this time of\r\nsorrow.\r\nI have the honour of speaking at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on an issue of great importance to my\r\ncountry: the progress made in the implementation of the\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution on the World Summit for\r\nChildren.\r\nAllow me to thank the Secretariat for the preparation\r\nof the report that is the basis for our deliberations. The\r\nreport is particularly informative and useful for evaluating\r\nthe achievements reached at mid-term and the difficulties\r\nfaced in fulfilling the commitments.\r\nThe World Summit for Children was a historic\r\nmilestone for the protection and defence of children.\r\nMoreover, it was the first of the United Nations world\r\nconferences of the 1990s. It initiated a new cycle which\r\ncontinued up to the most recent conference, the United\r\nNations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).\r\nIt was therefore a starting point for renewed efforts by the\r\ninternational community for social development and the\r\nfight against poverty.\r\nThe agreed objectives opened up new hopes, not\r\nonly for the definition of specific goals — for example,\r\nin terms of child mortality — but for the provision of\r\ninternational assistance required to achieve them. These\r\npromises have been translated into national action plans,\r\nan innovative way of preventing the objectives and\r\ncommitments from remaining merely on paper. At the\r\nmid-point of the decade, information on progress achieved\r\nhas proved difficult to interpret. In some areas, as in the\r\ncase of the fight against preventable diseases and the\r\nratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,\r\nadvances have certainly been significant. In areas such as\r\neducation and the reduction of malnutrition and mortality,\r\nhowever, the results still leave much to be desired.\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nWe hope that the ratification of the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child will lead to its prompt incorporation\r\ninto domestic legislation. This is indispensable for the\r\nsupport of measures pertaining to health, nutrition and\r\neducation, as well as of other actions for the protection of\r\nchildren. It also constitutes an important base for the\r\nimplementation of national plans of action.\r\nThe effectiveness of these plans depends on the\r\ncapacity of the international community — and particularly\r\nthe United Nations system — to provide the assistance\r\nrequired by the developing countries. We concur that\r\nresponsibility should not fall solely to the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF). That would be to deny the\r\nincreasing generalized character of problems concerning\r\nchildren in the context of the fight to eradicate poverty and\r\nto improve levels of social development.\r\nInstitutions such as the World Health Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the United Nations Population\r\nFund, the World Food Programme and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) have equally important\r\nroles to play. Only through them can we ensure that our\r\nobjectives where children are concerned will become an\r\neffective part of the comprehensive strategies for human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMobilization of necessary resources to attain the\r\nobjectives of the Summit is one of the most serious\r\nproblems we face. The capacity of developing countries to\r\ngenerate their own resources and earmark the necessary\r\nfunds for the social sectors has been seriously eroded by\r\nfiscal constraints deriving from economic structural reform\r\nprogrammes and, in many cases, from the heavy burden of\r\ndebt. There are no indicators suggesting a satisfactory\r\nimprovement in budgetary appropriations earmarked for\r\nbasic social services.\r\nThe efforts of developing countries to mobilize\r\nresources at the State, private-sector and civil-society level,\r\ncannot alone guarantee the volume of resources needed to\r\nfinance programmes for children. International cooperation\r\nneeds to be substantially increased, both in the form of new\r\nand additional financial resources and through broader\r\nprogrammes of technical assistance and other forms of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nOnly if the international community lives up to its\r\ncommitments to finance social development and transfers\r\nincreased resources to the developing countries will we be\r\nable to fulfil the promises made to our children seven years\r\nago. It is now time to renew that commitment and to\r\nadopt the measures necessary to ensure compliance with\r\nthe responsibilities upon which we have agreed by the\r\nyear 2000.\r\nFor all of these reasons, my delegation supports the\r\nidea that in the year 2001, a special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly should be held to review the extent to\r\nwhich we have succeeded in fulfilling our promises to\r\nchildren and how well we have implemented the\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action of the World Summit for\r\nChildren.\r\nOn that occasion, those sitting in supreme judgement\r\nover us will be the new generation of youths and children.\r\nAt that historic moment the international community will\r\nhave an opportunity to design new strategies so that our\r\ncommitments to children will extend beyond the year\r\n2000.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The World Summit for Children, held at\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters in New York in 1990, was\r\na turning point in international cooperation to promote the\r\nsurvival of children, their health, nutrition, education,\r\nprotection and development — in general, to look out for\r\ntheir future. The participation of the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nin the World Summit for Children was based on its desire\r\nto participate in the actions undertaken to enhance efforts\r\nto achieve these supreme objectives.\r\nBefore mentioning the achievements of the Syrian\r\nArab Republic since the World Summit for Children, I\r\nwould first like to express our satisfaction with the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the progress at mid-decade on\r\nthe implementation of General Assembly resolution\r\n45/217 on the World Summit for Children.\r\nWhile expressing our satisfaction with what has been\r\ndone to implement and carry out the resolutions of the\r\nSummit for Children, we should also like to confirm the\r\nneed to promote concerted action to ensure that the cause\r\nof children continues to be the focus of our concerns.\r\nAccording to one particular social theory, the future of\r\nthe State depends on progress achieved in fostering the\r\nwell-being and prosperity of children. In the other words,\r\nchildren are, as it were, the very kernel of the State.\r\nSince the Summit Declaration the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic has been making considerable efforts to provide\r\nprotection and development for children and the family.\r\nNational action has taken place on a large scale.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nSymposia and conferences have been held, the most\r\nimportant being the first national conference on child\r\nsurvival, held under the auspices of the President of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Hafez Al-Assad, on 28-29 January\r\n1991. That conference followed preparatory activities by\r\ncommittees of experts in the social, economic, health,\r\ncultural and environmental fields.\r\nThe economic sector, various professional and social\r\norganizations and religious institutions participated in this\r\nconference, as did ministers and heads of people’s\r\norganizations. An overall national plan of action was\r\nadopted at that conference, which reflected the status of\r\nSyrian children and what had been achieved to promote\r\ntheir interests in various areas. This programme of action,\r\nwhich defined the 1995 mid-decade goals, the strategic\r\nobjectives up to the year 2002 and the ways and means for\r\nimplementing these targets in all areas, was approved by\r\nthe Syrian Government for inclusion in the country’s basic\r\neconomic and social plans. The programme was then\r\nsubmitted to the various governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental sectors in our country for implementation. To\r\nthat end, a follow-up committee was also established under\r\nthe direction of the Minister of Health.\r\nAt the beginning of this year, we drew up a national\r\nreport indicating what had been accomplished in relation to\r\nthe mid-decade goals, as a result of the periodic review\r\ncarried out by experts. I would like to refer to some of the\r\nsalient points of the review. First, in the health field, action\r\nis under way to reach the target of eliminating\r\npoliomyelitis; salt iodization is being implemented; the rate\r\nof maternal mortality has decreased from 143 in 1989 to\r\n107 in 1995 for every 100,000 live births; 93 per cent of all\r\nchildren have been vaccinated and immunized against\r\nhepatitis; studies and evaluations have been made to\r\nsupplement current child nutrition information; and health\r\nplans have been drawn up to promote future health care.\r\nSecondly, in the field of education, the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic is in the vanguard of countries of the region with\r\nregard to applying a system of free and compulsory\r\neducation at the primary, secondary and university levels.\r\nSchool attendance at the primary level for 1994-1995 was\r\n98.8 per cent, including 99.2 per cent in the case of boys\r\nand 98.6 per cent in the case of girls.\r\nThirdly, the State has developed activities to assist\r\nchildren with disabilities through a national plan containing\r\nvarious programmes providing many benefits to children in\r\nthe areas of training, employment and social integration.\r\nThe State protects children in the aftermath of war and\r\narmed conflict, which has led to a massive and forced\r\nexodus from neighbouring areas. The State is striving for\r\na just and comprehensive peace to put an end to the\r\nsuffering of children in the aftermath of war. Similarly,\r\nthe State protects children and low-income families\r\nthrough the provision of grants and low-cost loans.\r\nMr. Muntasser (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nFourthly, the Syrian Arab Republic ratified the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child in 1992 and a\r\nministerial committee was established to disseminate\r\npublic information on the principles of the Convention\r\nwithin Syria and the Government, with the cooperation of\r\nofficial and people’s organizations. The State is doing\r\nwhat it can to ensure that laws on children are fully\r\nobserved in the social and cultural areas. These\r\nconstitutional provisions are in full accordance with the\r\nspirit and letter of the international Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child. This has been achieved by applying\r\nits provisions in our national legislation. Matters relating\r\nto children are the focus of the Syrian Government, which\r\nprovides many social grants for pregnant women and\r\nmothers. It is also developing child benefits since 48 per\r\ncent of the country’s population are children under the\r\nage of 18.\r\nThus, we are following the fundamental principles\r\nand the directives laid down by President Hafez Al-\r\nAssad. Despite our economic needs and the cost of\r\ndefending our territorial integrity, we are very proud of\r\nthe accomplishments of our country. Furthermore, our\r\ncountry will continue its efforts to ensure and promote the\r\nhealth, education and protection of children, as well as\r\nfocus on population matters and the environment, to\r\nensure that Syrian children have the requisite level of\r\neducation to enjoy a bright future.\r\nNow that we are discussing the sacred mission of\r\ncaring for children, I would like to refer to another\r\nhumanitarian question, and that is: can any child in the\r\nworld develop in the context of occupation and massacre?\r\nAll the children in the Golan, the occupied Arab\r\nterritories or in southern Lebanon are suffering as a result\r\nof the occupation. The reply to the question is found in\r\nUnited Nations resolutions. In this regard, I would like to\r\nreiterate that the costs of war are far greater than the cost\r\nof peace and must affect the needs of children.\r\nMr. Meniang (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to inform you of the measures\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\ntaken in my country in the context of the implementation of\r\nthe provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child\r\nand of the cooperation between the Ministry for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Sudan, the National Council on Children’s\r\nWelfare and the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF). On 23 June 1996, a symposium was held in our\r\ncapital, Khartoum, to keep members of the national\r\nParliament abreast of ways they can contribute through\r\nlegislation to the implementation and furtherance of the\r\nprovisions of the Convention. The symposium was\r\ninaugurated by the First Vice-President, Mr. Al-Zubayr\r\nMuhammad Salih, who stressed the following positions of\r\nprinciple in his inaugural statement.\r\nFirst, the Government of Sudan takes a special interest\r\nin the implementation of the international Convention,\r\nparticularly as the Sudan was among its first signatories.\r\nThe President himself participated in the signing. Secondly,\r\nthe interest of Sudan in the rights of children arises from\r\nthe faith of Islam, which cherishes man and safeguards the\r\nrights of children. Thirdly, to translate this interest into\r\nreality, the Government of Sudan established the National\r\nCouncil on Children’s Welfare and takes special interest in\r\nthe education of children. It has made elementary education\r\ncompulsory and takes special interest in the health of\r\nchildren, including our interest in establishing children’s\r\nhospitals. Fourthly, the efforts of the Sudanese Government\r\nfor peace and stability will continue until it has put an end\r\nto the causes of displacement, so that children can lead a\r\nhappy life with their families and parents. The State\r\nattaches special interest to the programme of peace,\r\ndevelopment and stability, of which children will be the\r\nmain beneficiary. Fifthly, the First Vice-President stressed\r\nSudan’s full commitment to the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child.\r\nMany documents were discussed at the symposium,\r\nwhich together highlight various aspects of the welfare of\r\nchildren. As expected, the members of the National Council\r\nwho took part were familiar with the issues, demonstrated\r\ntheir enthusiasm and pledged to promote the well-being of\r\nchildren in their provinces. A final document was adopted\r\nat the symposium which is aimed at ensuring healthy living\r\nstandards for the children of Sudan. The document also\r\nprovides for priority to be given to children’s welfare in\r\nnational development programmes. Cognizant of the need\r\nto enhance governmental and voluntary institutions, the\r\nmembers of the National Council will endeavour to\r\nimplement the Convention’s provisions and enhance efforts\r\nto safeguard children’s health and eradicate poverty, famine\r\nand malnutrition. Furthermore, it will seek to promote\r\npeace and the culture of peace and to enhance international\r\ncooperation designed to safeguard the needs of children\r\nand their rights. In conclusion, we emphasize our\r\nreadiness to apply the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. In this connection, our Parliament ratified this\r\ninstrument at a special session, thus making it a legally\r\nbinding State document.\r\nParagraph 161 of the Secretary-General’s report\r\nstates that conflict and insecurity in the southern part of\r\nthe country are a barrier to the eradication of guinea-\r\nworm disease and that almost half of the world’s\r\nremaining cases are in the Sudan. I would like to inform\r\nyou of some of the efforts being made by the Sudan to\r\neliminate the disease. Despite the insecurity caused by the\r\nrebel movement, the Sudanese Government is cooperating\r\nwith the Carter Center to eradicate this disease by the\r\nyear 2000. Former President Carter has visited the Sudan\r\nmore than once and a Carter Center office has been\r\nopened in the Sudan to cooperate with appropriate\r\ngovernment organs. I call upon the international\r\ncommunity, through the United Nations, to provide\r\nmaterial and technical assistance to help eliminate this\r\ndisease. We also wish to emphasize that the rebel\r\nmovement stands in the way of implementing the\r\nprogramme to control guinea-worm disease. It also uses\r\nchildren in armed conflict, thereby endangering their\r\nlives.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): As one enters the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) headquarters\r\nin New York, one sees an inscription on the wall near the\r\nreceptionist’s desk which says that the earth has not been\r\ngiven to us by our parents but has been lent to us by our\r\nchildren. I think that inscription summarizes the essence\r\nof our debate here today.\r\nOur deep appreciation goes to the Secretary-General\r\nfor introducing the report on the progress at mid-decade\r\non the implementation of General Assembly resolution\r\n45/217 on the World Summit for Children. This report\r\nhas certainly provided the Member States with a unique\r\nopportunity to have a comprehensive assessment of the\r\nprogress that has been made so far towards “keeping the\r\npromise” made during the World Summit for Children in\r\n1990. It also permits us to share our experience with a\r\nview to finding more effective means to address the\r\nchallenges that lie ahead of us.\r\nWe are happy to note that the report indicates that\r\nsignificant progress has been made in improving the\r\nconditions of children in most parts of the world during\r\nthe last five years. Yet we agree fully with the Secretary-\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nGeneral that a great deal remains to be done. Nonetheless,\r\none fact deserves our attention and appreciation, and it is\r\nthat the coordinated efforts undertaken by the United\r\nNations agencies, in particular UNICEF, the global agency\r\nfor children, and Governments of Member States, and the\r\ninitiatives by the members of civil society, particularly the\r\nnon-governmental organizations, have set an example of\r\nhow the international community can be mobilized for the\r\nwelfare and well-being of children. That is what we call the\r\ngrand alliance for children. This testifies to the fact that\r\ngiven political will and appropriate mobilization we can\r\nhave an impact on the future of this world.\r\nImproving the conditions of children is closely linked\r\nwith overall societal progress. It is said that poverty has a\r\nfeminine face. We say it has the face of children as well.\r\nWhen the mother is struggling with poverty, children are\r\ndefinitely the victims. In addition, children, as the most\r\nvulnerable section of the society, remain at the receiving\r\nend of every onslaught of poverty. Therefore, any efforts\r\ndirected at improving the condition of children has a\r\nsocietal dimension, and this needs to be appreciated\r\nproperly. We are happy that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has made some significant references to this\r\ncompulsion.\r\nConscious of this imperative, successive governments\r\nin Bangladesh, in particular the present Government, have\r\npursued rather aggressive strategies to address the problems\r\nconfronted by children. Bangladesh has become a signatory\r\nto the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild, which forms the basis of our national activities in\r\nthis important area. In fact, this element constitutes one of\r\nthe major components of our struggle to eradicate poverty\r\nas well. We fully agree with the Secretary-General when he\r\nsaid during the introduction of his report that this\r\nConvention is a social tool to reach the unreached and that\r\ninvesting in children and women is the path to sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur efforts have already started to produce tangible\r\nresults. In Bangladesh, we have been able to immunize 91\r\nper cent of the children through the extensive network of\r\nthe Extended Programme of Immunization. The child\r\nmortality rate has declined significantly. We are hopeful\r\nthat we will be able to meet our target in this sector by the\r\nend of the decade. As the home of oral rehydration therapy\r\n(ORT), Bangladesh has made a notable contribution\r\ntowards the reduction of death from diarrhoea. We are\r\nproud to say that the mortality rate from this tropical\r\ndisease has dropped significantly in recent years.\r\nNonetheless, our struggle to eliminate this threat completely\r\ncontinues. We have mounted an 18-month communication\r\ncampaign to boost the level of ORT use from 45 per cent\r\nto 80 per cent once and for all at the earliest possible\r\ndate. More than 55,000 primary school teachers have been\r\nengaged in this campaign since 1993.\r\nPrimary education is considered to be an essential\r\nelement in improving the conditions of children. Pursuant\r\nto its objective, the Bangladesh Government has made\r\nprimary and secondary education free for girls in rural\r\nareas. Special incentives in the form of “food for\r\neducation” have been introduced to encourage students,\r\nparticularly the girl students, to go to school. We are\r\nhopeful that through these policies we will be able to\r\nempower the girls, which may in the long term help to\r\nimprove the condition of the poorest section of the\r\npopulation in Bangladesh.\r\nMy country has also initiated some imaginative steps\r\nto address a child-related issue, which I would like to\r\nshare with the Assembly. Involvement of children in the\r\nwork force is a concomitant problem of poverty in many\r\ndeveloping countries. We are not immune to this problem\r\neither. In order to address the problem in a humane and\r\nconstructive way, the Bangladesh Government signed a\r\nmemorandum of understanding with the International\r\nLabour Organization and UNICEF last year with a view\r\nto eradicating child labour from the garment\r\nmanufacturing sector. These retrenched child workers will\r\nbe sent to school and training centres to develop their\r\neducational and work skills. This arrangement will be\r\nfinanced jointly by UNICEF and the private garment\r\nsector. We hope that this can serve as a model for others\r\nfacing similar problems in their countries.\r\nWe are conscious of our limitations and resource\r\ncapabilities. Despite the fact that we are devoting more\r\nthan 40 per cent of our annual budget to the social sector,\r\nthe magnitude of the problem constantly defies our\r\nefforts. We therefore think that the national efforts should\r\nbe supplemented by regional and global efforts. In order\r\nto muster the desired level of resources, efforts must be\r\nmade to reverse the present downward trend of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. At the regional level, we have\r\nalready adopted a regional plan for South Asia under the\r\nColombo Resolution on Children, which was endorsed by\r\nthe Seventh Summit of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1993. We are\r\ncommitted to fulfilling our obligations under this plan and\r\nhope that cooperation at the regional level will have more\r\nimpact on our common efforts to tackle this issue. In\r\nparticular, we believe that regional cooperation is essential\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nto stop transborder trafficking in children and utilizing them\r\nas bonded labour and prostitutes.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to record the\r\nappreciation of the Government of Bangladesh for the\r\nconstructive engagement of the various United Nations\r\nagencies in the socio-economic development of Bangladesh,\r\nincluding efforts to raise the well-being of children. In\r\nparticular, I would like to commend the support extended\r\nto us by UNICEF to improve the conditions of children in\r\nBangladesh. It is our hope that the United Nations\r\ndevelopment agencies will remain actively engaged with us\r\nin our relentless efforts for the eradication of poverty, in\r\nwhich an essential focus remains on the children.\r\nIn conclusion, we join with other delegations in fully\r\nendorsing the Secretary-General’s recommendations for\r\nholding a special session of the General Assembly in five\r\nyears’ time to examine the progress made in fulfilling the\r\npromises for children. Following the World Summit in\r\n1990, we in Bangladesh strongly hope that the year 2000\r\nwill see the second summit level gathering on children in\r\nthis body.\r\nMrs. Castro de Barish (Costa Rica) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The protection and support of children has\r\nalways been part of Costa Rica’s social policy. That goal\r\nwas established in the 1920s with the creation as a\r\ngovernment agency of the National Board for Children,\r\nwhich is still very active today.\r\nLike all the delegations that have participated in the\r\ndebate on agenda item 100, we also wish to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the report he has\r\npresented to us (A/51/256) with regard to progress at mid-\r\ndecade on implementation of General Assembly resolution\r\n45/217 on the World Summit for Children, which my\r\ndelegation had the honour to co-sponsor.\r\nCosta Rica supports the assessments and\r\ncomprehensive information as well as the realistic\r\nconclusions of the report. We welcome its account of the\r\nresponse of the United Nations system, in particular, on the\r\nimportant and fundamental role played by various\r\ncomponents of the United Nations system such as the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP). WHO developed health-related goals\r\nin collaboration with the UNICEF/WHO Joint Committee\r\non Health Policy, while UNESCO and UNICEF\r\ncollaborated on complementary activities in the educational\r\nsector through the Joint Committee on Education and the\r\nConference on Education for All held in 1990 in Jomtien,\r\nThailand. We wish also to stress the importance of the\r\nEducation Summit held in New Delhi with the support of\r\nUNESCO, UNICEF and UNDP in the joint project on\r\n“Education for All: Making it Work”. Undoubtedly, this\r\nis an example of joint action that can serve as a model\r\nand yield very valuable and positive results. We support\r\nthe statement that any substantial plan to reduce illiteracy\r\namong adults must begin by effectively improving\r\nprimary education for the benefit of children who will,\r\notherwise, be the adult illiterates of tomorrow.\r\nCosta Rica endorses the observation of Nicaragua\r\nconcerning mobilization of resources since, indeed, until\r\ngreater efforts are made to achieve mobilization of\r\nadditional resources, it will not be possible for developing\r\ncountries to promote the proposed goals. The report\r\nrecognizes that only an average of 12 per cent of national\r\nbudgets is earmarked for basic social services. Clearly, in\r\nmany developing countries, structural adjustments have\r\nnot always had a human face.\r\nMy delegation wishes to stress the conclusion in\r\nparagraph 285 of the report that:\r\n“The goals established at the 1990 World Summit\r\nfor Children have had an extraordinary mobilizing\r\npower, generating a renewed level of activity on\r\nbehalf of children around the world and creating\r\nnew partnerships between Governments, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, donors, the media, civil\r\nsociety and international organizations in pursuit of\r\na common purpose. There is a wealth of evidence to\r\nshow that the World Summit Declaration and Plan\r\nof Action, together with the almost simultaneous\r\npassage into international law of the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child, provided the impetus and\r\nthe legal framework for galvanizing global action\r\nbehind the cause of children.” (A/51/256, para. 285)\r\nMy delegation wishes to stress here the well-being of\r\ngirls, since it has been demonstrated that the situation of\r\ngirls is even more precarious than that of boys in all\r\ncircumstances of life.\r\nWith regard to progress made in reaching the goals\r\nin the Latin American and Caribbean region, we note with\r\ngreat interest the information provided in the regional\r\noverview, notably on achieving universal ratification of\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child at mid-decade.\r\nMy country has adapted its national legislation on\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nprotection and promotion of the rights of children in order\r\nto fulfil the commitments assumed as a State party to the\r\nConvention. Costa Rica some years ago established the\r\noffice of ombudsman, whose role is to defend the rights of\r\nall people whether they are citizens of the country or\r\nresidents of any nationality or origin.\r\nReturning to the report, we note that efforts at the\r\ninternational level to achieve universal ratification by the\r\nend of the decade have been less successful but,\r\nnevertheless, considerable. My delegation respectfully urges\r\nGovernments that have not yet signed and/or acceded to the\r\nConvention to consider doing so in order to make universal\r\nratification a splendid reality as we approach the year 2000.\r\nIn annex II of the report, which indicates the status of\r\nsignature of the World Summit Declaration, preparation of\r\nnational programmes of action and ratification of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child as of 31 May 1996,\r\nwe are pleased to note that Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean have fully ratified the Convention and signed the\r\nSummit Declaration, and virtually all the States parties have\r\ncompleted their national plans of action.\r\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity cordially\r\nand respectfully to urge States parties to the Convention\r\nthat have not yet done so to respond favourably to the\r\nrequest addressed to them by the Secretary-General under\r\narticle 50 of the Convention, which provides that an\r\namendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of that\r\narticle shall enter into force when it has been approved by\r\nthe General Assembly and accepted by a two-thirds\r\nmajority of the States parties to the Convention. The States\r\nparties have already adopted the amendment during\r\nconsideration of the recommendation at the Conference of\r\nStates parties to the Convention on 12 December 1995. The\r\nAssembly later gave its approval on 21 December 1995.\r\nCosta Rica’s amendment consists of replacing the word\r\n“ten” by the word “eighteen” in article 43, paragraph 2, of\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, and it was\r\napproved without a vote. The Secretary-General’s letter\r\ncontaining his request to States parties to the Convention\r\nwas sent on 29 March 1996. Accordingly, my Government\r\nwould be most grateful to the Governments of States parties\r\nto the Convention for their valuable support for this\r\namendment, whose purpose is to endow the Committee on\r\nthe Rights of the Child with eight experts in addition to\r\nthose it now has in order to carry out the multiple aspects\r\nof its mandate. Let us not forget what James Grant, the late\r\nExecutive Director of UNICEF always used to say:\r\n“Children first”.\r\nMr. Kiwanuka (Uganda): I should like to start by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for the report on progress\r\nat mid-decade on implementation of General Assembly\r\nresolution 45/217 on the World Summit for Children. Six\r\nyears ago, Heads of State and Government assembled in\r\nthis Hall adopted a World Declaration on the Survival,\r\nProtection and Development of Children and a Plan of\r\nAction for its implementation. This was only the\r\nbeginning of a series of global United Nations summits\r\nand conferences which will culminate with the World\r\nFood Summit in Rome next month. The deliberations of\r\nall these meetings have helped to redefine thinking on\r\nhuman development, to further attempts at achieving a\r\nqualitative difference to the lives of people and, not least,\r\nto reaffirm the commitment to the needs of children.\r\nAlthough progress towards achievement of the goals\r\nwe set ourselves for the survival, protection and\r\ndevelopment of all children has been uneven throughout\r\nthe world, it is gratifying to note that programmes of\r\naction for children are being implemented in 155\r\ncountries. What is equally significant is that 187 States,\r\nincluding Uganda, have now ratified the Convention on\r\nthe Rights of the Child. The challenge now is for\r\nGovernments to ensure implementation of the obligations\r\nundertaken under the Convention.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the positive trends\r\nreported by the Secretary-General to improve the\r\nprospects of survival and the lives of children worldwide.\r\nEncouraging progress has been made in immunization and\r\nthe eradication of guinea-worm disease. We commend\r\nalso the great efforts made to address iodine deficiency,\r\npromote oral rehydration programmes and improve access\r\nto safe water.\r\nUnfortunately, as the report indicates, there appears\r\nto be slower progress in reaching the goals in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, where there are still difficulties in achieving\r\noptimum improvements in the quality of nutrition,\r\nreducing maternal mortality and providing access to basic\r\neducation, particularly for girls. Sub-Saharan Africa is\r\nstill too vulnerable to drought, environmental degradation\r\nand the HIV/AIDS pandemic, together with disruptions\r\ncaused by armed conflict.\r\nIt is not possible to discuss the implementation of\r\nthe decisions of the Summit for Children without\r\nacknowledging the important role that UNICEF has\r\nplayed and continues to play. Indeed, we note with\r\nsatisfaction that Ms. Bellamy, its Executive Director, has\r\nmade the implementation of the Summit for Children one\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nof its main activities. The Fund has done important work in\r\nproviding assistance to countries, including Uganda, in the\r\npreparation of national programmes of action for children\r\nand their subsequent implementation, particularly in the\r\narea of coordination and monitoring and the development\r\nof inter-agency cooperation in the field to improve girls’\r\neducation and mitigate the consequences of female illiteracy\r\nin our region.\r\nIn the opinion of the Ugandan delegation, the results\r\nof the mid-decade review and the national reports prepared\r\nby many countries should be used widely by UNICEF in\r\naccentuating its targets for the period up to the year 2000\r\nand thus influence the operationalization of country\r\nactivities.\r\nThe Government of Uganda, for its part, is about to\r\nembark on the implementation of its pledge to provide free\r\nprimary education for four children per family. Uganda\r\ncommends the measures adopted at the Consensus of Dakar\r\n(June 1993), which were the outcome of the 1992\r\nInternational Conference for Assistance to the African\r\nChild, and reaffirms that it still remains the principal point\r\nof reference for follow-up to the World Summit for\r\nChildren in sub-Saharan Africa. The participating countries,\r\nincluding Uganda, committed themselves to translate the\r\ngoals of the Summit into concrete national programmes of\r\naction. Nevertheless, we are aware that there have been\r\nshortfalls that are concealed by misleading national\r\naverages, as a result of the difficulties and contrasts of\r\nmajor social disparities and the children who are victims of\r\nexploitation, of physical and emotional violence, and of\r\nabandonment and injustice.\r\nUganda therefore reaffirms its commitment to share\r\nthe responsibility for ensuring the survival, protection and\r\ndevelopment of all children and taking note of the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to hold an end-of-decade\r\nreview meeting to examine the fulfilment of the \"promises\r\nto children\". It is in that spirit that we anticipate more\r\nprogress on child survival and great improvement in their\r\nquality of life.\r\nAgenda item 45 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/348)\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana): At the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment held in Copenhagen in March 1995, world\r\nleaders took tough political decisions and committed\r\nthemselves to create an economic, political, social,\r\ncultural and legal environment that would enable people\r\nto achieve social development and social justice. They\r\nrecognized the significance of human well-being for all\r\nand agreed to give the highest priority to the achievement\r\nof these goals now and into the twenty-first century.\r\nIn December 1995, this Assembly initiated the\r\ndebate on the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nSummit. For the second year running, this item has been\r\ninscribed on our agenda, underlining the importance that\r\nwe all attach to the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nConference. In this connection, my delegation fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by Costa Rica\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development is one\r\nof a number of world conferences which began in 1990\r\nwith the World Summit for Children and ended recently\r\nin June 1996 with the Istanbul Conference on Human\r\nSettlements. Organized under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, these global conferences have focused attention\r\non the complex phenomenon of development in the\r\npolitical, economic, social, cultural, environmental, legal\r\nand related fields in a holistic manner. With the\r\ndisappearance of East-West ideologies and North-South\r\nconfrontations, the potential for cooperation and the\r\nforging of a sense of partnership to seek global solutions\r\nto world problems have gained heightened awareness and\r\nhave made all this achievement possible.\r\nBenefiting from this new sense of responsibility and\r\nsolidarity within and between nations, the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development agreed on 10 major commitments\r\naround the overall theme of poverty eradication, full\r\nemployment and social integration. In addition, the\r\nSummit came up with a Programme of Action that\r\noutlined the policies and actions required to implement\r\nthe principles and fulfil the commitments agreed to in\r\nCopenhagen.\r\nWe are also mindful of the ground-breaking\r\nstrategies the Summit adopted to assign specific\r\nresponsibilities for actions to fully implement all of its\r\ncommitments and objectives. Thus while it acknowledged\r\nthat individual countries bear the primary responsibility\r\nfor the attainment of the goals of the conference, it also\r\nrecognized that the support of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole — including of the United Nations\r\nsystem, the multilateral financial institutions, bilateral\r\ndonors, non-governmental organizations and all actors of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\ncivil society — will be crucial if we are to realize all the\r\nobjectives of the conference.\r\nIt is too early at this stage to attempt to take stock of\r\nwhat has been achieved so far in terms of implementing the\r\noutcome of the Summit. Suffice it to say that my delegation\r\nis satisfied to see and learn about the various initiatives and\r\nengagements of all countries, large and small, rich and\r\npoor, as well as those of the United Nations system, the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and actors of civil society in\r\ngeneral, to implement the commitments.\r\nMy own country, for instance, has established a\r\nNational Development Planning Commission that is charged\r\nwith implementing and monitoring the Government’s\r\nmacroeconomic and sectoral policies to ensure broad-based\r\nsustained economic growth and equitable and sustainable\r\ndevelopment that meets the aspirations of all members of\r\nour society. A comprehensive development policy\r\ndocument, “Ghana Vision 20-20: The First Step”, placed\r\nbefore Parliament recently, has been fully debated; its\r\nprovisions are being translated into a national programme\r\nof action or reference document that will inform the entire\r\ngovernmental structure, non-governmental organizations and\r\nthe international community of the enabling environment\r\nestablished for the country’s priority social and economic\r\nactivities. Our programme of action places a great deal of\r\nemphasis on national coordination mechanisms, capacity-\r\nbuilding and the mobilization of internal and external\r\nresources to ensure its effective implementation.\r\nAt the international level, even though official\r\ndevelopment assistance continues to decline in real terms,\r\ncertain countries have raised their level of assistance in\r\nsupport of social development. In this connection, it is\r\npertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in\r\nApril 1996 on the implementation of the 20/20 initiative,\r\naccording to which interested developed- and developing-\r\ncountry partners will allocate 20 per cent of official\r\ndevelopment assistance and 20 per cent of the national\r\nbudget, respectively, to basic social programmes. It is also\r\nencouraging to note that at the annual meeting of the\r\nBretton Woods institutions a few days ago, some\r\nencouraging decisions were taken to address not only the\r\nissues of debt, but also the overall financial and resource\r\nproblems of developing countries, and to ensure that\r\nstructural adjustment programmes will be carried out in a\r\nhuman-centred manner.\r\nBy far the greatest impetus and momentum given to\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the world social\r\nSummit has come from the United Nations itself. Since\r\n1995, our Organization has assumed a true leadership role\r\nin the follow-up to the Summit — and, indeed, in the\r\nfollow-up to all the other reinforcing global conferences\r\nit organized — by assigning responsibilities to what has\r\ncome to be called lead United Nations agencies, which\r\nmonitor specific task forces that have been set up to\r\nimplement the outcome of the various conferences.\r\nHaving declared 1996 the International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty, the General Assembly has taken\r\nmeasures to review progress towards poverty eradication\r\nand to provide policy guidelines to encourage further\r\nactions in this regard. The recent mid-term review of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s and the launching in March 1996 of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Initiative on Africa must\r\nbe seen in this light. The Economic and Social Council\r\nhas, since its 1995 substantive session, and in particular\r\nits 1996 substantive session, intensified its dialogue with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and other specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations in support of a\r\ncoordinated implementation of economic and social\r\ndevelopment programmes. Furthermore, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council has gone beyond this to involve all its\r\nfunctional and subsidiary bodies — and in particular the\r\nCommission for Social Development — in the Conference\r\nfollow-up.\r\nAll these actions and measures assure us that we are\r\non the right path, even if there is still a long way to go to\r\nachieve the goals and objective agreed upon by our\r\nleaders in Copenhagen. We need to continue to invest in\r\nthe implementation process the same political will that\r\ncharacterized the agreements reached at the Summit. The\r\nreforms in the United Nations system as a whole should\r\nbe seen as part of this overarching desire to equip our\r\nOrganization so that it will be better able to discharge its\r\nobligations under the Charter, not only to maintain world\r\npeace and security but also to promote social progress and\r\ngreater freedom for all in such a manner that the human\r\nperson becomes the central object of our collective\r\nendeavours and attention.\r\nMs. Gordon (Jamaica): I wish to express my\r\nGovernment’s support for the statement made yesterday\r\nby Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nand to join previous speakers in thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report contained in document A/51/348.\r\nThe report is very thorough in its description of\r\nfollow-up activities undertaken by Governments and by\r\nthe entire United Nations system since the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption last year of a resolution on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nSocial Development. As described by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, there has been a great effort to implement the\r\nprovisions of the resolution and to consolidate joint\r\nactivities on the part of the United Nations bodies engaged\r\nin the follow-up process. My delegation wishes to highlight\r\nspecifically the recent decisions taken by the Commission\r\nfor Social Development and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil concerning the future organization of their work in\r\nconnection with their respective roles in the implementation\r\nprocess.\r\nIn this respect, the elaboration by the Commission of\r\nits agenda and multi-year work programme for 1997 to\r\n2000 demonstrates a keen commitment and willingness to\r\nbegin to fulfil its expanded mandate. Likewise, Jamaica\r\nwishes to endorse the resolutions adopted by the Economic\r\nand Social Council during its recent substantive session,\r\nparticularly on the follow-up to the World Summit and on\r\nthe future role of the Commission for Social Development.\r\nWe could not agree more with the concern expressed\r\nby the Economic and Social Council for mainstreaming the\r\ngender perspective in United Nations activities for poverty\r\neradication, and for taking a harmonized and integrated\r\napproach to intergovernmental consideration of poverty\r\neradication.\r\nJamaica, like other Member States, participated\r\nactively in the World Summit for Social Development and\r\nfully endorsed the fundamental principles embodied in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration. We are fully conscious, however,\r\nthat the true measure of our commitment must be\r\ndemonstrated in concrete actions.\r\nIn this connection, some 60 programmes contributing\r\ntowards poverty reduction are currently being spearheaded\r\nby Jamaican Government ministries. In addition, several\r\nnon-governmental organizations, as well as multilateral and\r\nbilateral donors, have been contributing to the poverty-\r\nreduction process by initiating or sponsoring a range of\r\nprojects in Jamaica.\r\nIt should be emphasized that the cornerstone of\r\nJamaica’s poverty-reduction efforts is human-resource\r\ndevelopment. The human-resource development programme,\r\nwhich consists mainly of investment and policy reforms in\r\neducation and health, represents the strongest expression of\r\nthe Jamaican Government’s intention to alleviate poverty\r\nthrough investment in human capital.\r\nIn keeping with its commitment to ensuring a\r\nstrengthened framework for national, regional and\r\ninternational cooperation for social development, Jamaica\r\nhas instituted definite planning, implementation and\r\nmonitoring systems as part of its follow-up to the\r\nSummit. These include: first, the establishment of a\r\nnational committee, headed by the Minister responsible\r\nfor social development, to monitor implementation of a\r\nnational plan of action; secondly, the launching of the\r\nnational poverty-alleviation programme; thirdly, the\r\ninvolvement of civil society through a social-partnership\r\napproach; fourthly, fostering social integration through the\r\nrecognition of the role of the family in social stability;\r\nand, lastly, employment generation through labour-market\r\nreform.\r\nThe response of the Jamaican people, including\r\nelements of the private sector, to these initiatives has been\r\nvery positive. There appears to be a collective recognition\r\nof the urgency with which the issues of poverty and\r\nsocial development need to be addressed in my country.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the vulnerability of the\r\neconomies of small States such as those in our subregion.\r\nCaribbean economies remain severely hampered by the\r\nexternal-debt burden, unfair terms of trade, wide\r\ndisparities in income distribution and threats posed by\r\ninternational drug trafficking, among other factors.\r\nStructural-adjustment policies adopted since the 1980s\r\nhave eroded many of the earlier gains made in the social\r\nsector, and it is partly these deficiencies that Caribbean\r\nGovernments, including my own, hope to address by the\r\nadoption of our respective social-development\r\nprogrammes. It is recognized, however, that these very\r\nprogrammes are often quite ambitious in their scope and\r\nin what they seek to achieve. Their implementation,\r\ntherefore, presents a further strain in the short term on the\r\nalready burdened State machineries of Caribbean\r\nGovernments.\r\nIn this connection, it has long been recognized that\r\nthere is a correspondingly urgent need for the\r\nmobilization of resources to assist national poverty-\r\neradication/social-development programmes. We therefore\r\nlook forward to the presentation at next year’s substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on all aspects of new and\r\ninnovative ideas for generating funds for globally agreed\r\ncommitments and priorities, particularly those established\r\nat recent United Nations conferences and summit\r\nmeetings.\r\nOn a similar point, my Government wishes to restate\r\nits concern that there is need for the scientific community\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nto be further sensitized to the crucial importance of science\r\nand technology in contributing to poverty eradication and\r\nsocial development.\r\nIn conclusion, Jamaica wishes to reiterate its\r\nappreciation to the relevant agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem for their responsiveness to the various Government\r\ninitiatives in the area of social development. The United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO), to name but a few, have all\r\nparticipated strategically in national consultations and have\r\nmade both financial and human resources available to the\r\nGovernment of Jamaica. They have played a key role in\r\nfacilitating collaboration with multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions in mobilizing support for poverty-alleviation\r\ninitiatives.\r\nDespite some persistent problems, my Government\r\nremains firmly committed to the implementation of the\r\nSummit commitments. We have no choice. We look\r\nforward to continued dialogue with our partners in the\r\ninternational arena on ways and means of achieving global\r\nsolutions to the myriad problems that we face in the area of\r\nsocial development, including poverty eradication.\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation takes special interest in speaking\r\nin the debate on agenda item 45, “Implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development”.\r\nUnited Nations concern for social development is\r\nnothing new. Suffice it to recall the Declaration on Social\r\nProgress and Development, the International Development\r\nStrategy and the Declaration on International Economic\r\nCooperation, which was adopted at the eighteenth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThese earlier steps led to the Copenhagen World\r\nSummit for Social Development, demonstrating once again\r\nthat the international community is truly attempting to deal\r\nwith the most serious social problems by proposing\r\ninnovative methods and approaches.\r\nWe are especially grateful for the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/51/348), which gives us a\r\ncompendium of the initiatives taken by national\r\nGovernments, the measures adopted by the United Nations,\r\nthe activities of the specialized agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system, the mobilization\r\nof financial resources and the participation by civil\r\nsociety and other elements.\r\nAt the meeting of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment held last May, my country spoke about a\r\ntopic that deserves special attention, namely, the\r\neradication of poverty. On that occasion, we noted that\r\nthe subject is one of extraordinary magnitude and\r\nimplications, that it is growing worldwide and that it is\r\none of the more complicated items in the social agenda.\r\nIn Argentina, favourable economic trends led to a\r\nsignificant increase in gross domestic product in the early\r\nmonths of this year. There are also concrete economic\r\nfactors and developments that can be viewed as positive\r\ngains in the struggle against poverty. Minimal inflation,\r\nmade and planned investments, increases in exports that\r\nwill further promote productivity and employment — all\r\nthese tend to confirm this trend.\r\nWe are aware that much remains to be done, and\r\ntherefore my Government’s activities, principally through\r\nthe Secretariat of State for Social Development and with\r\nthe cooperation of provincial and local authorities, have\r\nbeen stepped up and expanded in recent years.\r\nThus, we have implemented a broad-based social\r\npolicy that includes support for housing construction, the\r\nprovision of emergency food assistance to the needy and\r\nmeals for children, and the promotion of community\r\nactivities, along with various types of family assistance,\r\nand productive activities for workers in specific areas.\r\nWe have set up a social-information base in order\r\nbetter to monitor and systematically analyse the status of\r\npoverty in Argentina. This has served as a means of\r\nfocusing social programmes and has helped in evaluating\r\nthe before-and-after performance of those directed\r\nespecially to the poor.\r\nThrough the participatory fund for social investment,\r\nwe have established machinery for financing community\r\ninitiatives in the poorest parts of the country. We have\r\ncreated social-development programmes along border\r\nareas, thereby improving their inhabitants’ quality of life.\r\nLikewise, we have developed programmes for\r\nneighbourhood improvement and for assistance to\r\nespecially vulnerable children.\r\nThese actions are being taken in keeping with two\r\nessential elements: first, greater emphasis on education,\r\nsince, in the final analysis, poverty cannot truly be\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\neliminated without effective education; and secondly, a\r\nreform of the State that promotes investment so that\r\neconomic growth can lower the unemployment rate. These\r\ntwo elements are truly the only substantive approaches to\r\neradicating poverty. All these actions are being pursued in\r\na framework of good governance and austerity.\r\nOn a regional level, our firm commitment to fulfil the\r\nagreements of the World Summit led to the Summit\r\nMeeting of the Rio Group in Buenos Aires, from which\r\nemerged the Buenos Aires declaration on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. We also proposed a temporary\r\nsecretariat for the convening of a technical meeting to\r\ndevelop an operational plan. The goal of that meeting, held\r\nin Quito, Ecuador, was to establish machinery among the\r\nRio Group member countries for following up on the\r\ndecisions reached at Buenos Aires. Jointly with the\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs of the\r\nOrganization of American States, we also held in Buenos\r\nAires an American technical seminar on programmes to\r\novercome poverty. That meeting took place within the\r\nframework of the proposed work plan. Finally, I should like\r\nto highlight the initiative to send a group of “White\r\nHelmets” to work jointly with the countries requiring them\r\nfor the production of food, food aid and assistance in\r\ngeneral.\r\nAll these activities, together with Argentina’s\r\ncontributions to the various funds that, directly or indirectly,\r\nhave an impact on the eradication of poverty, and with the\r\nwork of many non-governmental organizations and private\r\nentities, are testimony to our intense and sustained national\r\ncommitment. According to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme’s (UNDP) Human Development Report,\r\nArgentina ranks sixth among developing countries and\r\nthirtieth among United Nations Members. This provides an\r\neven stronger impetus for persevering and forging ahead.\r\nThe eradication of poverty occupies a central place on\r\nArgentina’s agenda. We have taken effective action for its\r\neradication on various levels, because we know that poverty\r\ndegrades and diminishes human beings, and our\r\ncommitment is to the human being.\r\nMr. Meléndez-Barahona (El Salvador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I have the honour to make the following\r\nstatement on agenda item 45, entitled “Implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment”, on behalf of the Central American countries:\r\nCosta Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and\r\nEl Salvador. Central America shares and supports the\r\ncriteria set forth in the statement made yesterday by Costa\r\nRica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAt the outset, we wish to express our deepest\r\nsympathy at the disaster that occurred yesterday in the\r\nsisterly Republic of Guatemala, in which some 79 people\r\ndied and many others were wounded when a sporting\r\nevent turned tragic. This sad event has touched both\r\nCentral America and the world of sports.\r\nIn the context of the other world conferences the\r\nUnited Nations has held in recent years, the convening of\r\nthe world social Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in\r\nMarch 1995, was a historic political achievement. At that\r\nevent Heads of State or Government acknowledged the\r\nimportance of social development and human well-being.\r\nThey reviewed the various factors that affect the\r\nachievement of social-development goals as well as the\r\npressing need to achieve consensus on national, regional\r\nand international measures and machinery to resolve the\r\nurgent social problems that seriously challenge the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe convening of that important Summit is\r\ntestimony to the globalization that has occurred, a process\r\nthat has given rise to universal understanding and\r\nawareness, as well as the commitment and political will\r\nto redefine the paradigms of development. This process\r\ntakes account of the past and present realities that\r\ncharacterize the prevailing international system, a system\r\nthat places the human being at the centre of development\r\nand that recognizes that our economies must be more\r\neffectively reoriented to respond to the needs of peoples.\r\nWe must emphasize that this needs to take place in a\r\ncontext in which social and economic development,\r\nenvironmental protection, and peace and democracy are\r\ninterdependent, mutually reinforcing components of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nCentral America accepted the changes in the global\r\nsituation with optimism, especially with respect to the\r\nexpectations that have arisen for the creation of a new\r\ninternational system characterized by solidarity and\r\ncooperation among States. In that context, we supported\r\nthe holding of the World Social Summit and of other\r\nworld conferences, because we believe that the problems\r\nof development, viewed comprehensively and from the\r\nperspective of sustainability, present the greatest challenge\r\nto our societies. This is due to their close interrelationship\r\nwith peace, stability, democracy and human well-being.\r\nDespite this positive outlook, however, we recognize that\r\nthe less developed nations throughout the world must still\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\novercome considerable and serious obstacles in order to\r\nsurmount the structural causes of backwardness and\r\npromote sustainable development, and that they are\r\nnegatively affected by changes in the international order.\r\nThese changes have increased vulnerability, insecurity and\r\nuncertainty in many of our countries, especially because our\r\ndomestic conditions are not adapted to the requirements of\r\nchanging technology and competition that must be met in\r\norder for us to become part of the global economy. The less\r\ndeveloped nations must face this challenge with resolve.\r\nWe cannot ignore the fact that the gap between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries has been widening,\r\nnot narrowing. Most developing countries still can only\r\naspire to make progress in such campaigns as those against\r\npoverty, unemployment, the spread of disease,\r\nenvironmental risks, arms and drug trafficking, money\r\nlaundering and terrorism, as well as campaigns to empower\r\nwomen and consolidate democracy and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. This is due not only to the scarce and limited\r\nresources available, but also to the exhaustion of\r\ndevelopment cooperation funds.\r\nThe international community has, in recent years,\r\nwitnessed changes and advances in the political, economic\r\nand social spheres of Central America. With the help of\r\ninternational cooperation, we have overcome severe crises.\r\nThese joint efforts have shifted from the political-economic\r\nsphere to the socio-economic sphere, giving greater impetus\r\nto the establishment of a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development. Making progress in these\r\nareas and consolidating that already made is closely linked\r\nto the implementation of the commitments set forth in our\r\nregional development strategy. This strategy, devised by the\r\nCentral American presidents in the Alliance for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, encompasses human development, economic\r\ngrowth and environmental sustainability. It is an initiative\r\naimed at redefining the Central American development\r\nmodel by revitalizing our relationships with the\r\ninternational community and renewing our involvement in\r\na globalized, interdependent world economy. The\r\nimplementation of this strategy is based not only on the\r\nsignatory States’ taking greater responsibility, but also on\r\nthe assistance of extra-regional partners that are concerned\r\nabout the development of the subregion and wish to provide\r\nfinancial support to the initiative and share some\r\nresponsibility for its implementation. In 1994 the United\r\nStates of America became the first such partner when it\r\nsigned the joint United States-Central America declaration.\r\nWe also believe it is important to point out that for the\r\nfoundations of the Alliance for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Central America to become a reality we\r\nmust make the greatest efforts in the region to overcome\r\nthe major obstacles of extreme poverty and poverty in\r\ngeneral. We must have human resources that are well\r\ntrained at all levels so that the majority of the\r\npopulation — especially the most vulnerable sectors —\r\nwill have access to health and sanitation services.\r\nWe must foster and strengthen democratic\r\nparticipation in the political sphere to develop, through a\r\nsharing of responsibility between the State, local\r\ngovernment and civil society, a model of unified efforts\r\nfor social development.\r\nCentral America is currently promoting policies that\r\nstress social development, particularly to reduce poverty,\r\ncreate jobs and promote productive employment. At the\r\nsame time, it is evaluating and reformulating\r\ncommitments in keeping with the realities of our\r\ncountries, in order to develop strategic plans in priority\r\nareas, seek sources of financing for their implementation\r\nand allocate responsibility to the governmental bodies\r\nentrusted with their implementation. This includes efforts\r\nto achieve real coordination between the agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations system that cooperate in the formulation\r\nand the implementation of development plans at the\r\nnational level.\r\nWe are grateful for the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/51/348) on the agenda item under consideration. It\r\npresents an encouraging view of the feasibility of\r\napplying the results of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. This can be inferred from the positive\r\nresponses of Governments and international institutions\r\nwith regard to the importance of the Summit and its\r\nfollow-up.\r\nIt is important to maintain the momentum that began\r\nat Copenhagen in order to proceed progressively towards\r\nthe goals of eradicating absolute poverty, reducing general\r\npoverty and increasing employment and social integration\r\nin each national context.\r\nIn reviewing the report of the Secretary-General, we\r\nwish to emphasize some of its aspects.\r\nThe initiatives of Austria and Denmark deserve our\r\nsupport. Their results make possible a better\r\nunderstanding of the problems of social development.\r\nWe welcome with interest the Declaration of the\r\nGroup of Seven industrialized Powers, which was adopted\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nat their meeting in France this year, in which we should\r\nhighlight the offers to create a new global partnership for\r\ndevelopment, to cooperate towards achieving greater\r\neffectiveness in multilateral institutions and to provide the\r\nnecessary support for development.\r\nSpecial attention is warranted by the proposals of the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\non a global partnership for development to achieve specific\r\ngoals in the social sphere, and by the 20/20 initiative, which\r\ngives priority to basic social services for the vulnerable\r\nsectors of the population, a matter on which the\r\nAmbassador of Norway spoke more fully yesterday. Both\r\nof these proposals are consistent with the basic goals of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. We believe,\r\nhowever, that they should be examined in depth so that we\r\ncan have a more detailed understanding of them and\r\ndetermine how viable they are as part of national\r\nprogrammes for social development. This should be done\r\nin keeping with the priorities set by individual\r\nGovernments — especially in developing countries — so\r\nthat there will be coordination and consistency between\r\ninternational efforts and those of the Governments\r\nconcerned.\r\nWe are optimistic that the globalization process and\r\ninterdependence will lead to a better understanding and to\r\ninternational solidarity that will improve the trends in\r\nofficial development assistance and gradually achieve the\r\ndonor community’s agreed goal of providing 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross national product for that purpose, in fulfilment of\r\nthe promises made at Copenhagen. We also hope to see an\r\nincrease in the financing of development programmes,\r\nwhich are necessary to achieve the goals of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development.\r\nWith regard to the operation and cooperation of the\r\nfunds, programmes and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations, which play a fundamental role in following up\r\nfulfilment of the goals of the Summit, we believe that\r\ncoordination and consistency in their activities must be\r\nenhanced. We should establish a direct and dynamic link\r\nwith national agencies and the work they do in each\r\ncountry, in order to evaluate progress in the implementation\r\nof the commitments.\r\nOne of the immediate goals of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development is the eradication of extreme poverty\r\nand poverty in general. Poverty affects broad sectors of the\r\nworld’s population and generates despair and social\r\nconflict. We believe that in seeking solutions the\r\ndevelopment of policies to combat poverty must take a\r\nnumber of aspects into account. Among those aspects are\r\nthe following.\r\nBroad agreements should be reached at national,\r\nregional and international levels to put in place a long-\r\nterm anti-poverty strategy based on a determination of the\r\nbasic facts and features characterizing poverty.\r\nPoverty has structural roots. Accordingly, we must\r\napproach its causes, not simply its effects.\r\nThere should be greater understanding of the\r\nproblem’s scope and dimensions, and an open and\r\nflexible attitude should be adopted.\r\nPoverty is a massive and chronic phenomenon,\r\nespecially in developing nations. It calls for greater\r\nproductivity and the creation of employment.\r\nEconomic policy instruments should not exacerbate\r\nsocial conflict, adversely affect the distribution of income\r\nor contribute to the spread of poverty among the most\r\nvulnerable groups.\r\nEconomic strategies aimed at guaranteeing individual\r\nliberties, private property and free competition should also\r\nhave the goals of eradicating poverty and promoting a\r\ngreater degree of economic democratization.\r\nPriorities should not be exclusively focused on\r\nmacroeconomic factors or global balance; instead,\r\neconomic policies should include measures to improve\r\nliving conditions and economic and social opportunities\r\nfor the most vulnerable groups.\r\nNational redistribution policies should gradually be\r\nestablished. These are necessary in order to break the\r\nvicious circle of poverty and should include\r\nimprovements in health, nutrition, training, food\r\nprogrammes and policies for investing in human capital.\r\nThe dynamic redistribution of wealth should improve\r\ncredit for the production sector, public investment in the\r\nproductive infrastructure and public social expenditure. It\r\nshould make possible the development of a policy of\r\nrising productivity and economic opportunities for the\r\npoor.\r\nThere should be greater access to credit for small\r\nproducers, especially those in the agricultural sector,\r\nwhose modernization cannot come about through the free\r\nworking of market mechanisms.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nThere should be greater technical and financial support\r\nfor informal activities to improve the institutional\r\nenvironment and stimulate and increase its productive\r\nabilities, thus fostering a more integrated economy and\r\nsocial progress.\r\nThere should be a realistic re-evaluation of\r\nemployment and salaries that takes into account the social\r\ncosts of adjustment problems and their impact on living\r\nstandards of societies, particularly among the most\r\nvulnerable sectors.\r\nCentral America is pursuing efforts to promote social\r\ndevelopment with equity. While recognizing that the\r\nprimary responsibility to achieve the goals of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action falls to\r\nour Governments, we believe that the importance of\r\ncooperation and international assistance to achieve full\r\nimplementation is beyond question.\r\nThe spirit of solidarity, dialogue and cooperation\r\ndisplayed at the World Summit for Social Development\r\nshould be put into practice in order to create a more\r\nfavourable international economic environment and promote\r\nmore effective cooperation. We believe it is indispensable\r\nto establish an international strategy based on a new\r\npartnership that will make the fulfilment of our\r\ncommitments viable. That strategy should bear in mind the\r\ninterests and priorities of developing countries for the\r\nsolution of their serious problems. This would result in an\r\nimprovement in social conditions and the elimination of the\r\nroots of social tensions and conflicts.\r\nFinally, within the framework of this new partnership\r\nit is important that we pursue the process of revitalizing\r\nand restructuring the United Nations. We believe that the\r\ncapacity and efficiency of the Organization need to be\r\nenhanced. The Organization needs to be given sufficient\r\nfinancial resources to fulfil its mandate for development\r\nand social progress.\r\nWe must also stress, however, that by no means\r\nshould programmes in the economic and social sphere\r\nundergo budgetary cuts. International financial institutions\r\nshould re-evaluate the effects of structural-adjustment\r\npolicies and the negative consequences of debt servicing in\r\nrelation to the promotion of sustainable social development\r\non a global scale.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): Implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development is\r\na matter of great interest to the Government and people of\r\nGuyana. As the Chairman of the Group of 77 stated\r\nyesterday, developing countries everywhere have an\r\ninterest in ensuring that an enabling environment is\r\ncreated both nationally and internationally for social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur own commitment to social development has\r\nbeen clearly demonstrated, not least by our decision,\r\ndespite limited resources, consistently to increase — both\r\nin absolute and percentage terms — that portion of the\r\nnational budget destined to the social sector, and more\r\nparticularly to health and education services. The current\r\nallocation accounts for some 16 per cent of the 1996\r\nbudget and will be increased to 20 per cent in 1997. In so\r\ndoing, we will have fulfilled our obligations under the\r\n20/20 initiative, to which we fully subscribe.\r\nOur full acceptance of this initiative is less the result\r\nof any belief in a magic formula than of our persuasion\r\nof the value of people-centred development and of the\r\n“Oslo Consensus on 20/20” as a means of achieving that\r\ngoal. We are convinced that, within the framework of a\r\nglobal partnership for development, most basic social\r\nservices can be made available to all peoples and the\r\nscourge of poverty can be removed from the world.\r\nWe are pleased to note that steps have been taken at\r\nthe intergovernmental level over the past year to follow\r\nup the World Social Summit that, in our view, are\r\nevidence of the resolve of the international community to\r\nhonour the Summit commitments. Resolution 50/161, for\r\nexample, which was adopted by the General Assembly\r\nlast year, provides a firm basis for further action by\r\nGovernments and the United Nations system. It also\r\nunderscored the critical importance of national action and\r\ninternational cooperation for social development. At the\r\nsame time, it called for a suitably expanded Commission\r\nfor Social Development, which, with a membership of 46\r\nStates meeting annually instead of biennially, will allow\r\nfor greater participation in the monitoring of the\r\nimplementation process. The Commission’s role will also\r\nbe further dynamized through the active involvement of\r\ncivil society and relevant expert personnel.\r\nThe Commission’s multi-year programme of work\r\ncovering the period 1997-2000 will address the themes of\r\nproductive employment and sustainable livelihoods;\r\npromoting the social integration and participation of all\r\npeople, vulnerable groups and persons; and social services\r\nfor all. We trust that the deliberations will be directed\r\ntowards the eradication of poverty, which we consider a\r\nmatter of urgency. As acknowledged at Copenhagen and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\noft repeated since, over one billion people in the world\r\ntoday live in unacceptable conditions of poverty, mostly in\r\ndeveloping countries, with women and indigenous peoples\r\nespecially disadvantaged. In Africa, the situation of people\r\nliving in poverty is expected to worsen in the coming years\r\nwith the concomitant threat of further instability on that\r\ncontinent. As was decided at the recent substantive session\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, there needs to be great\r\ncoordination of United Nations system activities for poverty\r\neradication, both at the national level and at headquarters.\r\nIn this regard, the agreed conclusions of the Council on this\r\nissue should be fully implemented.\r\nAs part of our observance of the International Year\r\nand first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty, we must actively pursue resolution S-1996/1 on\r\nstrategies and actions for the eradication of poverty, which\r\nwas adopted by the Commission for Social Development at\r\nits special session in May 1996. In this regard, we believe\r\nthat the Caribbean Community Ministerial Meeting on\r\nPoverty Eradication, which is to be held around 28 October\r\nto 1 November in Trinidad and Tobago, will make an\r\nimportant contribution to the follow-up and implementation\r\nof this and other resolutions. Under the theme “Taking\r\naction on poverty eradication”, the Ministers will identify\r\npriority action to be taken at the national and regional\r\nlevels relating to poverty eradication as well as ways and\r\nmeans of enhancing inter-organizational cooperation within\r\nthe region.\r\nIn my own country, the Government has mounted a\r\nrelentless campaign against poverty. We have attempted to\r\nset clear objectives and provide means for their\r\nachievement. In this context, we are currently working to\r\nestablish realistic and measurable targets and to design\r\nconcrete plans and programmes of action. A national\r\ndevelopment strategy will soon be finalized to provide the\r\nframework for an action plan for poverty alleviation.\r\nRegrettably, however, like so many other developing\r\ncountries, we find our efforts severely constrained by an\r\nonerous debt burden, the servicing of which consumes a\r\ngood part of national revenue, and by the negative effects\r\nof structural adjustment, particularly its impact on social\r\ninfrastructure, including health, education and welfare\r\nprovisions. We are therefore understandably anxious for the\r\nUnited Nations system as a whole to have a common\r\nunderstanding of our problems and in particular of the\r\nrelationship between debt and poverty, between structural\r\nadjustment and poverty, and between drugs and poverty.\r\nAgainst the background of limited resources at the\r\ndomestic level, particular attention needs urgently to be\r\npaid by the United Nations to the mobilization of the\r\nsubstantial new and additional resources required for the\r\nfull implementation of the commitments issuing from the\r\nSummit. We welcome in this regard, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme’s Poverty Strategies Initiative\r\nand the United Nations Trust Fund for the Follow-up to\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development as concrete\r\nexamples of commitment to supporting the efforts of\r\ndeveloping countries. We need, however, to go further\r\nand expedite the implementation of existing debt-relief\r\nagreements and the negotiation of the further\r\narrangements called for by our Heads of State and\r\nGovernment.\r\nIn this context we wish to acknowledge, with\r\nappreciation, the recent initiatives announced by the\r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nInternational Development Association and the Paris Club\r\nto help the highly indebted and poorest countries. Still,\r\nwe must continue to build on the mandate of Economic\r\nand Social Council resolution 1996/48, regarding new and\r\ninnovative ways to generate funds.\r\nThe search for new and innovative ideas must in no\r\nway, however, supplant already existing commitments to\r\nthe financing of development. Official development\r\nassistance remains pivotal to the development of most\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed,\r\nwhich, despite their best efforts, remain economically\r\nstagnant.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that our attention must\r\nnow be focused on operationalizing assistance for efforts\r\nat the country level within the framework of national\r\npriorities and programmes through the active support of\r\nthe United Nations system and the wider international\r\ncommunity. For our part, we will continue to do all we\r\ncan to promote social development, both nationally and\r\ninternationally, so that when we come to the year 2000\r\nand review the Copenhagen Programme of Action, we\r\nwill be proud of the progress made.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The World Summit for Social Development\r\nheld in Copenhagen in March 1995 was an important\r\nmilestone in the joint international effort to establish a\r\nnew international order and initiate a new phase in human\r\nhistory.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nThe lofty ideals of the Summit — the elimination of\r\npoverty, full employment and social integration — provided\r\na framework to enable the international community to\r\ncreate a more just, secure and progressive world. My\r\ndelegation would like to associate itself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, which reflected the position of\r\ndeveloping countries on matters relating to the follow-up to\r\nthe international Summit.\r\nEach one of us will have to make efforts to implement\r\nthe decisions and guidelines laid down at the Copenhagen\r\nSummit, in addition to the ambitious targets that it\r\nidentified. My country believes that there can be no\r\nsubstitute for North-South and South-South cooperation in\r\nstemming the deterioration of social and economic\r\nconditions and in making the necessary adjustments in the\r\ninternational arena to promote the prosperity and stability\r\nof peoples.\r\nWe believe that the international community must be\r\nthorough and specific in expressing its solidarity with the\r\ndeveloping countries in resolving their basic problems. We\r\nalso believe that assistance given by developed countries to\r\ndeveloping countries also benefits the donors and their\r\nfuture generations. For their part, developing countries\r\nshould not rely solely on aid provided by developed\r\ncountries; on the contrary, all the actions of the developing\r\ncountries should reflect the principle of self-sufficiency.\r\nThose are the views of my country with regard to\r\ninternational cooperation and the achievement of social\r\ndevelopment at the international and local levels. Such\r\ncooperation should be based on the principles of mutual\r\nrespect and mutual benefit.\r\nSyria was an effective participant in the debate held at\r\nthe recent session of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment. We believe that it is important that every\r\npossible effort be made to consolidate and strengthen the\r\nCommission so that it can follow up on the results of the\r\nWorld Summit on Social Development at the appropriate\r\nlevel. We believe that the steps taken to expand the\r\nCommission and to convene its meetings on an annual basis\r\nare in keeping with the ambitions of the international\r\ncommunity for the future role and mission of that body.\r\nWe would like to confirm the importance of the role\r\nof the Bretton Woods institutions in implementing the\r\nresults of the Social Summit, especially in strengthening\r\nprogrammes for developing countries so that, no longer\r\nconstrained by unsustainable conditions, they can make\r\nfurther efforts to promote social development and\r\nalleviate the debt burden under which many of them\r\nsuffer.\r\nGiven Israel’s policies of occupation, my country is\r\nobliged to invest greatly in its military technical and\r\nhuman strength. Modern Syria has carried out a very\r\nsuccessful social development plan covering all sectors of\r\nsociety, to the extent allowed by our wealth, potential\r\nand, in particular, human factors.\r\nI should like to refer to the fact that Syria is one of\r\nthe 10 leading States in the developing world in the field\r\nof economic development, as the 1992 United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme Human Development Report\r\nmakes clear. Over the past two decades Syria, through the\r\nefforts of President Hafez Al-Assad, has been\r\napproaching the problem of development essentially by\r\nconcentrating on the basic target — the individual, the\r\nsole object of our efforts. We have therefore ensured that\r\neducation at all levels and health services are provided\r\nfree of charge. We have focused especially on the\r\nmarginalized sectors of the population living under\r\ndifficult circumstances. In this context, we are particularly\r\nconcerned about children, the disabled, displaced persons,\r\nrefugees, orphans, the elderly and others.\r\nThroughout our territory, there are considerable\r\nnetworks of national organizations and associations of\r\nbenevolent and civil institutions that play a distinctive role\r\nin society and freely and effectively participate in social\r\nactivities for development. Furthermore, the Government\r\nof Syria has agreed to implement the Standard Rules on\r\nthe Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with\r\nDisabilities, pursuant to resolution 48/96. All the policies\r\nthat my country is pursuing in this respect have yielded\r\nmajor social accomplishments, and this has been\r\nspecifically reflected in the standard of living of the\r\nmajority of our citizens throughout our national territory.\r\nIt has also resulted in an increase in education and health\r\nbenefits for people in towns and villages. The level of\r\nhealth care and education has been enhanced and infant\r\nand maternal mortality has been reduced. This is part of\r\na plan to foster national integration and to ensure\r\nopportunities for productive employment, with the aim of\r\neliminating unemployment.\r\nIn the Syrian Golan, however, where many Syrians\r\nhave had to leave their villages, work places and schools,\r\nthe Israeli occupation has for more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury imposed a heavy burden on Syrian efforts to\r\nbring about social and economic development in the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\ncountry. This occupation has increased the obstacles to our\r\nefforts to produce a higher standard of living.\r\nForeign occupation is a tremendous hindrance to our\r\nefforts for social development. Israel is occupying our\r\nterritory and flagrantly violating the human rights of Arabs\r\nliving under the yoke of its occupation. Israel is pursuing\r\nsystematic policies aimed at distorting our national identity\r\nand pillaging our resources by destroying houses,\r\nconfiscating lands and acting against our citizens.\r\nThe time that has elapsed since the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development may seem brief, but my country has\r\nbeen working on genuine social development for over two\r\ndecades. My country has attached particular importance to\r\nthe results of the World Summit. A world free of\r\ncolonialism, foreign occupation and aggression, and\r\nprotected from the threat of racial hegemony, expansionism\r\nor colonization is the necessary precursor of a world free of\r\npoverty, injustice and oppression, in which relations are\r\nmore democratic, humane, secure and stable for the well-\r\nbeing of one and all.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nKuwait has always attached particular importance to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen\r\nin 1995, where Kuwait was represented at the Summit by\r\nHis Highness the Emir. The Summit led to the revitalization\r\nof the Commission for Social Development to follow up on\r\nthe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nPermanence is the characteristic feature of Kuwait’s\r\nefforts in the areas of social development, human\r\nsettlements and administrative policies, as well as in\r\nmeasures to encourage the private sector, within the\r\nframework of the economic and social development process\r\nfor the years 1995-1996 and up to the year 2000. The basic\r\naim of these planning and development efforts is to make\r\nthe citizens of Kuwait productive and to improve the human\r\nand cultural dimensions of society.\r\nSocial development in Kuwait is covered by several\r\neducation, cultural, information and social welfare\r\nprogrammes that enhance the participation of citizens in\r\nvarious areas of social activity. These programmes also\r\npromote the role of women as the mothers of future\r\ngenerations, without reducing their role in the workforce,\r\nwhile strengthening programmes of social welfare with a\r\nspecial emphasis on children, adolescents and marginalized\r\ngroups. Of particular importance are measures to manage\r\nand coordinate volunteer activities between the Government\r\nand national institutions, as well as those that foster\r\ncooperation and rationalization. People can thereby\r\nparticipate in the social sector to improve health services,\r\nfocus on problems of consumption and production and\r\nhelp to offset unfortunate trends in those particular areas.\r\nTo that end, Kuwait has created machinery that has\r\nhad an important impact on achieving the goals of social\r\ndevelopment. Government annual expenditure in that\r\nsector reached 53.5 per cent of gross national product in\r\nthe 1980s, 108 per cent in the period 1990-1993, and\r\nnearly 82 per cent in 1993. This was due to the financial\r\nand economic costs of reconstruction after the liberation\r\nof Kuwait in February 1991, as well as to the efforts of\r\nthe State to continue to finance social services.\r\nBefore the discovery of oil on its territory, Kuwait\r\nmet the challenges of life under extremely difficult\r\neconomic conditions, which is why we are very aware of\r\nthe problems being faced by developing countries. Since\r\nKuwait has achieved a surplus from its oil earnings, it can\r\nnow participate in social and economic development\r\nactivities. Part of our assistance to developing countries\r\nis in the form of loans and grants made through the\r\nKuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, which\r\nwas created in 1961 to implement development\r\nprogrammes and economic and social programmes in\r\nArab and Muslim countries, as well as other fraternal and\r\nfriendly countries. As of 1994, that Fund had granted 445\r\nindividual loans to the amount of 2.22 billion dinars.\r\nThrough non-governmental organizations in Kuwait and\r\nthrough projects drawn up by those organizations, Kuwait\r\nhas been able to demonstrate the human dimension of its\r\nassistance. The rate of assistance provided by Kuwait was\r\n4.4 per cent of the gross national product in the 1980s.\r\nAlthough Kuwait is a donor and creditor country, we\r\nare aware of the problems faced by developing countries\r\nin the area of social development, and in particular from\r\nthe debt burden. That is why Kuwait has made an appeal\r\nto all donors to forgive part of their debts and to write off\r\nsome of their interest to the benefit of the poorest\r\ncountries. This was clearly reflected in the statement of\r\nMr. Al-Sabah to the General Assembly on 28 September\r\n1988, when he said that Kuwait was ready to cancel the\r\ndebts of those countries. This is testimony to Kuwait’s\r\npioneering efforts on behalf of international development.\r\nWe welcome the role being played by the\r\nCommission for Social Development in the Copenhagen\r\nProgramme of Action, the main elements of which are to\r\nbe implemented in coming years. We wish to reaffirm our\r\nsincere commitment to cooperating with the Commission\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nin order to achieve the targets set in Copenhagen, as well\r\nas implementing the Programme of Action.\r\nMy delegation would also like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the efforts being made by the regional\r\neconomic commissions in following up on the results of the\r\nSocial Summit. In particular, we point to the efforts of the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Western Asia. Efforts\r\nare being made, in cooperation with the International\r\nLabour Organization, to design profiles for poverty-\r\nalleviation policies in four sectors: health, education,\r\nemployment and fiscal policy. As regards social integration\r\nin Lebanon, we must define precise measures for achieving\r\nthe social development objectives specified for that country.\r\nMy delegation would like to commend the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to\r\nsupport national activities to promote follow-up to the\r\nCopenhagen Programme of Action and its assistance to\r\nnational programmes in creating favourable conditions for\r\nthe implementation of national poverty-eradication plans\r\nand strategies. It is our hope that UNDP will be able to\r\nimplement the 42 proposals that have been approved for\r\nfunding under the Poverty Strategies Initiative.\r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate its intention fully\r\nto cooperate, through the Kuwaiti National Committee, in\r\nthe follow-up to the Copenhagen Programme of Action and\r\nthe decisions taken at that Summit.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the\r\noutset, I would like to extend our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his informative report, contained in document\r\nA/51/348 and entitled “Implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development”. My delegation\r\nwould also like to associate itself with the statement made\r\nby the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nNineteen months have elapsed since the successful\r\nconvening of the World Summit at Copenhagen, where the\r\nHeads of State and Government carefully examined the\r\ngrave social problems facing humanity at large. Amongst\r\nother ills, poverty, unemployment and deteriorating social\r\nintegration — which had already been identified as the\r\nmost acute problems threatening the well-being and\r\nprosperity of the world community — were at the top of\r\nthe Summit’s agenda. They were duly and comprehensively\r\naddressed by the participants who, at the conclusion of the\r\nSummit, committed themselves to according the highest\r\npriority to national, regional and international policies and\r\nactions for the promotion of social progress worldwide.\r\nThis commitment entailed, inter alia, the realization of\r\njustice for all and the betterment of the human condition\r\nin an environment conducive to participation by all.\r\nNow, at this follow-up phase, we need to utilize the\r\nopportunity provided to take stock of both the\r\nachievements and progress made and of the shortcomings\r\nand failures encountered. Thus, a thorough evaluation and\r\nan objective assessment of international endeavours and\r\nnational initiatives is in order if we are determined to\r\nensure an effective and coordinated follow-up to the\r\ncommitments undertaken at the Summit.\r\nLet us begin by reviewing the concrete measures\r\ntaken at the international level to achieve the main goals\r\nof the Summit: the eradication of poverty, the expansion\r\nof productive employment and the enhancement of social\r\nintegration.\r\nIt goes without saying that unrelenting poverty is the\r\nmost serious problem facing humankind today. For\r\ndeveloping countries, it is aggravated by debt burdens,\r\nwidespread unemployment, deepening environmental\r\ncrises, lack of adequate international aid and deterioration\r\nin the trade environment due to the protectionist policies\r\nof certain States. We strongly believe that a renewed and\r\nfocused commitment to international cooperation is an\r\nimperative if we are to ease poverty globally. We may\r\nrecall that, although the Social Summit acknowledged that\r\nthe primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests\r\nwith national Governments, it also emphasized the\r\nimportance of support and contributions from the\r\ninternational community, the United Nations and\r\nmultilateral financial institutions.\r\nOne of the commitments made at the Summit was to\r\nmobilize new and additional financial resources that are\r\nadequate, predictable and mobilized to maximize the\r\navailability of such resources. Subsequently the\r\nCommission for Social Development, at its special session\r\nin 1996, reiterated that commitment by calling for the\r\nimplementation of agreed measures to eradicate poverty\r\nand for strengthened international cooperation.\r\nNevertheless, we have noted with concern certain\r\nindicators that point to a contrary trend. Apart from some\r\nactions taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations,\r\nthere is little substantive international cooperation in this\r\nrespect. In paragraph 34 of the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nwe read that\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\n“the Council expressed concern at the decline in\r\nconcessional resources for multilateral development\r\ninstitutions, which makes it more difficult for them to\r\nrespond to the massive challenge of assisting countries\r\nin poverty eradication.” (A/51/348, para. 34)\r\nIn light of the preceding observations — all of which\r\ntend to point to the responsibility of the international\r\ncommunity to generate a substantial increase in the flow of\r\nexternal resources for poverty eradication — we now need\r\nto raise the question as to whether the international\r\ncommunity, particularly multilateral financial institutions,\r\nare willing to play their role and to take action in this\r\nregard.\r\nAddressing the question of debt reduction or\r\ncancellation, identified in the Secretary-General’s report in\r\nparagraph 19, has been stressed as one of the main\r\nprerequisites for the implementation of the goals of the\r\nSummit. It goes without saying that the main responsibility\r\nhere rests first with the developed countries. It should be\r\nemphasized, however, that the developing countries are not\r\nlooking for hand-outs; rather they are calling for fair play\r\nin the world economy and honest observance of the rules of\r\nthe game. Genuine competition and laying the foundations\r\nfor a market economy are effectively hampered by the ever-\r\ngrowing burdens of protectionism. A reversal of protective\r\ntrade policies as well as the removal of obstacles for the\r\nsmooth and unhindered transfer of technology are among\r\nthe priority areas requiring action.\r\nThe problems of unemployment and underemployment\r\nmust be tackled at two levels. At the global level,\r\ndismantling of trade barriers by developed countries, flow\r\nof financial resources and investment to developing nations,\r\ntransfer of technology, alleviation of the debt burden and\r\nsharing experiences can play an important role. Although\r\nmost countries follow economic policies based on market\r\nforces, the attainment of reasonable development seems to\r\nbe out of reach, if not impossible. Many developing\r\ncountries have adopted and implemented structural\r\nadjustment policies, improved the overall level of\r\nmanagement and committed themselves to combat internal\r\ncorruption; despite all that, their development is still\r\narrested. Many of these countries have opted for the free-\r\nmarket-economy solution only to be disillusioned by the\r\nobliterating impact of an unfavourable international\r\nenvironment.\r\nOn the home front, supporting the private and informal\r\nsectors, promotion of self-employment, provision of credit\r\nfacilities to the unemployed, encouraging the creation of\r\nvolunteer organizations including grass-roots financial\r\norganizations, investment in training and education\r\nprogrammes, optimal use of resources such as land and\r\nwater, expansion of labour-intensive economic activities\r\nand a focus on the service sector are among the necessary\r\nfirst steps.\r\nIt has been strongly suggested that prescriptions\r\ndesigned to realize national social integration should also\r\nbe applied at the international level. To this end, each\r\nState should have an equitable and fair share in shaping\r\nthe international economic, social and political order. We\r\nneed to forge a rule-based system of international\r\nrelations in which might and wealth do not generate rights\r\nand in which principles of international law are fully\r\nobserved. The coercive economic measures and unilateral\r\nactions used by certain States against developing countries\r\nare inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter and also contradict the Declaration of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development which, inter alia,\r\nrequires States to refrain from any unilateral measure not\r\nin accordance with international law and the Charter or\r\nthat creates obstacles to trade relations among States.\r\nSuch measures are aimed at imposing the will of one\r\nState on others, and consequently impede the natural\r\nprocess of social development in developing countries. I\r\nwould like to emphasize that promotion of respect for the\r\nrule of law by all States, big and small, and for the\r\npriority of multilateralism and not unilateral actions, are\r\nthe hallmarks of our shrinking world. This is an approach\r\nthat serves the interests of the international community as\r\na whole.\r\nWe also learn, from paragraph 22 of the report, of\r\nsome views of leaders of the Group of Seven\r\nindustrialized countries, reflected in the final communiqué\r\nfrom their most recent meeting at Lyon, France. While\r\nthat communiqué, among other things, calls for\r\nstrengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for\r\nthe provision of necessary multilateral support for\r\ndevelopment, it is astonishing to witness how one of the\r\nmembers of that group, in total disregard of those stated\r\npurposes, which are relevant issues to the follow-up of\r\nthe Copenhagen Summit, and in pursuance of its own\r\nshort-sighted and politically motivated interests,\r\nvehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through\r\nthe adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects\r\nagainst other countries. The world community can no\r\nlonger tolerate this arrogant behaviour and irresponsible\r\nattitude, and should react appropriately and swiftly to stop\r\nthis trend before lawlessness receives de facto\r\nrecognition.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran’s development strategies,\r\npolicy plans and programmes are being reoriented to a\r\npeople-centred human development approach. In that\r\nprocess, the quality of life of the people has emerged as a\r\nnew focus of concern. Despite unfavourable external\r\nfactors, economic hardship and the long-term financial and\r\nsocial implications of hosting 2 million to 4 million\r\nrefugees for over 17 years, a large portion of total public\r\nexpenditure has been allocated to social development and\r\npoverty alleviation, which has had an effect on social\r\nindicators.\r\nHaving incorporated these elements into its second\r\nfive-year national development plan, the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran, in line with its commitments undertaken at the\r\nSummit, has embarked upon a wide range of initiatives,\r\nsome of which can be summarized as follows: a national\r\nproject for poverty eradication was adopted by our\r\nPresident last month. Identifying economic hardship of the\r\npeople, creating the appropriate bases and opportunities for\r\nfull employment of both men and women and addressing\r\nthe causes of vulnerable social groups, particularly the\r\ndisabled and elderly, are among its major goals.\r\nTo ensure youth the development and welfare, we\r\nhave established the High Council for Youth. This Council\r\ncoordinates the activities of other organizations and bodies\r\nworking for youth, with the aim of identifying priority areas\r\nof concern, such as employment, education and leisure time\r\nactivities.\r\nTo further promote the dignity and worthiness of the\r\ndisabled, a specific department has been set up in the\r\nMinistry of Labour and Social Affairs to coordinate and\r\nsupervise the development of medical and social protective\r\nservices and to ensure the availability of jobs for the\r\ndisabled. Furthermore, 10 per cent of overall employment\r\nopportunities have been allocated to war veterans and the\r\ndisabled.\r\nThe share of the development budget, in total,\r\nincreased from 19.4 per cent in 1988-1989 to 38 per cent\r\nin 1994-1995, and it is foreseen that the ambitious goal of\r\n48 per cent will be reached in 1996-1997, a step\r\nunprecedented throughout the history of Iran’s economy.\r\nMajor headway has been made in infrastructural\r\ndevelopment, so that potable water, roads, schools,\r\ntelephone services, clinics, and other basic services have\r\nbeen brought to thousands of cities, towns and villages,\r\nincluding the remotest areas of the country. At this time, 76\r\nper cent of the population in rural areas have access to\r\nproper roads, 74 per cent benefit from electricity, and 86\r\nper cent have access to safe drinking-water. By the end of\r\nthe second development plan, running from 1995 to 1999,\r\nsome 98.9 per cent of the urban population will be\r\nsupplied with sanitary piped water.\r\nNearly 80 per cent of the rural population and all\r\npeople in the urban areas have easy and free access to\r\nbasic health care. The United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) report entitled “Summary of mid-term reviews\r\nof country programmes” stated that the multiple indicator\r\ncluster survey conducted in September 1995 in the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran\r\n“confirmed that most of the mid-decade goals have\r\nbeen achieved. Therefore, the focus has now shifted\r\nto goals for the end of the decade.”\r\n(E/ICEF/1996/P/L.42, para. 30)\r\nMeanwhile, the Government has taken steps to\r\nimprove the economic conditions of people in lower\r\nincome brackets by adopting and implementing different\r\nmeasures such as enforcement of agricultural support\r\nprogrammes through subsidized input and guaranteed\r\nprice floors for the output, an inflation-adjusted minimum\r\nwage for workers in manufacturing, low-priced public\r\nutilities for the lower consumption levels, and subsidized\r\nhousing.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the\r\ncommon responsibilities of all of us — Governments,\r\nUnited Nations bodies, and non-governmental\r\norganizations — in ensuring the implementation of the\r\ncommitments undertaken at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment require joint efforts at all levels. In this\r\nregard, the Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared to\r\ncontinue its active participation in collective endeavours\r\nin order to achieve the goals of the Social Summit.\r\nMs. Thahim (Pakistan): Last year, here at the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we proclaimed the critical importance\r\nof national and international action for social\r\ndevelopment. We stressed that for an effective follow-up\r\nto the World Summit for Social Development, we\r\nrequired renewed political will and the definition of time-\r\nbound targets for the eradication of poverty, generation of\r\nproductive employment and promotion of social\r\nintegration.\r\nTo achieve these objectives, a multi-pronged strategy\r\nwas adopted. First, Governments were to initiate their\r\nefforts with the support of the United Nations, the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nmultilateral financial institutions, regional organizations and\r\nall actors of civil society. Second, the United Nations had\r\nto launch a three-tiered intergovernmental process. Third,\r\nthe Commission for Social Development was to be\r\nrevitalized. Fourth, the Economic and Social Council was\r\nto provide overall guidance and to oversee system-wide\r\ncoordination in the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nSummit.\r\nWe must express satisfaction over the impressive\r\nprogress made towards the achievement of these goals. In\r\nthis context, we would like to compliment the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for presenting a comprehensive report on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit. The\r\nexhaustive overview in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nclearly indicates that we have laid down the foundations for\r\nconcerted and coordinated action.\r\nThe goals of the eradication of poverty, reduction of\r\nunemployment and expansion of productive employment\r\nremain areas of top priority. The policy deliberations in the\r\nCommission for Social Development and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council in this regard are very important. Ultimate\r\nsuccess will, however, depend on operational programmes\r\nbeing implemented in the countries with the help of United\r\nNations agencies, regional commissions and multilateral\r\nfinancial institutions. The inputs of other functional\r\ncommissions, particularly the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the Commission on the Status of Women, the\r\nCommission on Population Development, the Statistical\r\nCommission and the Commission on Human Rights, are\r\nhighly valuable. The activities of the regional commissions,\r\nhowever, need to be upgraded.\r\nThe follow-up to the Social Summit should not merely\r\nlead to a boom in expert meetings. The real objective,\r\nnamely the alleviation of the suffering of hundreds of\r\nmillions of people, should not be blurred in a plethora of\r\nactivities. All initiatives have to remain cost-efficient and\r\nshould not be bogged down in minutiae. Above all, the\r\ngoals and targets have to be very realistic. Otherwise, at the\r\nend of the first five years, we shall be forced to report a\r\nfailure.\r\nThe United Nations Secretariat has made valuable\r\ncontributions to the follow-up process. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report indicates, during last year the United\r\nNations Secretariat brought out excellent publications on\r\nsocial development. These publications, which provide\r\nuseful guidelines to decision makers, could be disseminated\r\nin a more focused manner. Due regard should be given to\r\ntheir timely transmission to the focal points in missions\r\nand capitals.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) Administrator’s Poverty Strategies Initiative\r\nlaunched early this year has enormous potential. We must\r\nfully support this initiative as it holds tremendous promise\r\nfor the implementation of poverty eradication plans and\r\nprogrammes. The funds allocated to various programmes\r\nin different regions are very paltry. At present, they are\r\nmerely notional and represent just a beginning. In this\r\nregard, the UNDP Resident Coordinator system’s\r\ncollaborative follow-up should be further strengthened.\r\nWithin the existing inter-agency framework, UNDP, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO) and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions can steer the follow-up process from analysis\r\nto implementation to monitoring to periodic review.\r\nWe welcome the World Bank’s decision to expand\r\nits work in the areas of social development. The new\r\nexternal financing provided for education, health and\r\nnutrition will indirectly contribute towards the eradication\r\nof poverty. Direct investment in projects aimed at\r\neliminating poverty will produce quick and tangible\r\nresults. The increasing attention devoted by the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund to devising measures to\r\nprotect the most vulnerable segments of society is a step\r\nin the right direction. The focus of the World Bank and\r\nIMF on the efficiency of public expenditure is a worthy\r\ngoal, but one that requires public debate and closer\r\nscrutiny.\r\nThe time-bound targets in the areas of poverty,\r\nprimary education, gender equity, health care and\r\nsustainable development adopted by the Organisation for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\r\ncountries might be unrealistic because they are not\r\nmatched by any commitment for resources.\r\nThe decrease in official development assistance\r\nfollowing the Social Summit is disturbing. In his annual\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has noted that in the last year such assistance\r\ndeclined to 0.27 per cent of gross national product,\r\nagainst the agreed United Nations target of 0.7 per cent.\r\nWe, however, support the reorientation of official\r\ndevelopment assistance to development support.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nimplementation of the social Summit cites the overall new\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nincome of UNDP. We would have appreciated a clearer\r\ncorrelation of UNDP’s new income with the Summit goals,\r\nalthough we do realize that such a breakdown would have\r\nbeen a difficult exercise. We hope that the new funding of\r\n$22 billion announced for the International Development\r\nAssociation (IDA) in March of this year will be oriented\r\ntowards the outcome of the goals of the Social Summit,\r\nwith particular emphasis on poverty eradication. No\r\nmeaningful progress has yet been made in the field of new\r\nand innovative resources that could ultimately bail the\r\nUnited Nations out of its financial crisis. For independent\r\ndecision-making, the United Nations needs financial\r\nautonomy. We must therefore redouble our efforts to\r\nidentify new and innovative resources. The problem of the\r\nalleviation of the debt-servicing burden is being addressed\r\nat a very slow pace.\r\nWe must express our satisfaction at the consistent\r\nefforts made to establish an effective partnership between\r\nGovernments and the actors of civil society on the one hand\r\nand non-governmental organizations and the United Nations\r\non the other. The 28-year-old Economic and Social Council\r\nresolution 1296 (XLIV) was updated this year to ensure,\r\ninter alia, an enhanced and more meaningful involvement\r\nof non-governmental organizations in the implementation of\r\nsocial policies at the national and international levels and in\r\nthe follow-up to the social Summit. The active participation\r\nof non-governmental organizations in the follow-up would\r\ngo a long way towards guaranteeing the success of our efforts.\r\nThe Government of Pakistan actively participated in\r\nthe preparatory process to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. We are pursuing the goals of the Summit in\r\nclose cooperation with the United Nations, the Economic\r\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)\r\nand multilateral financial institutions. Pakistan has launched\r\nan $8 billion social action programme, which focuses on\r\npoverty eradication, basic education, primary health care,\r\nnutrition, water supply and sanitation. Within this\r\nframework, additional elements related to poverty\r\neradication, the empowerment of women, the generation of\r\nemployment and environmental protection have been\r\nincluded. Our programmes are being supported by United\r\nNations agencies based in Pakistan, donor countries and the\r\nWorld Bank. The Government of Pakistan is determined to\r\nachieve the goals of the Summit by utilizing its own\r\nresources. However, such a Herculean task cannot he\r\naccomplished without massive investment in human-\r\nresource development.\r\nThe central plank of our social action programme is\r\nthe massive spread of primary education, with an\r\nacceleration of the enrolment of girls. In one year alone,\r\n10,800 new primary schools have been established;\r\n34,000 new schools are being opened. To achieve our\r\nobjective of the universalization of primary education by\r\nthe year 2000, we have increased the allocation of\r\nexpenditure on education. In this context, special\r\nemphasis is being given to female education and health.\r\nSome 60 per cent of the funds have been allocated to\r\nfemale literacy, and 70 per cent of the new schools\r\nplanned over the next three years will be for girls. In\r\naddition, under the Prime Minister’s national health-\r\nworkers scheme, 100,000 girls are being trained to\r\nprovide multiple services encompassing health, education\r\nand population welfare.\r\nAll of these measures undertaken by the Government\r\nof Pakistan require consistent and determined efforts, the\r\nparticipation of the private sector and non-governmental\r\norganizations and the enhanced support of the\r\ninternational community. The international efforts should\r\nnot be limited solely to policy debates, research and data\r\ncollection. The answer lies in technical cooperation and\r\ntraining programmes at the operational level. Enhanced\r\ninternational technical assistance and advisory services\r\ncan decisively strengthen national capacities and the\r\ninstitutional bases for supporting national plans and\r\nstrategies that are designed to bring about sustained and\r\nsustainable social development.\r\nIn conclusion, I would express the hope that all\r\nnecessary steps will be taken to build on the elaborate\r\nframework put in place by the United Nations, United\r\nNations agencies, Governments and multilateral\r\ninstitutions. Our deep political commitment, clear\r\ndirection and faithful implementation of the Summit\r\ndecisions can sustain our efforts.\r\nMs. Wronecka (Poland): I would like to associate\r\nmyself with the statement made by the representative of\r\nIreland on behalf of the members of the European Union.\r\nHowever, I should like to add some comments. At the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, all the\r\nparticipants acknowledged that the primary responsibility\r\nfor attaining the goals set forth in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action rested with national\r\nGovernments, with the support and contribution of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nPoland welcomes the new framework created by the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the activities of the Commission\r\nfor Social Development as the functional commission\r\nwith the main responsibility for the follow-up and review\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nof the implementation of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. We are pleased that in the draft resolution it\r\nsubmitted to the Economic and Social Council the\r\nCommission recommended a multi-year programme of\r\nwork to the year 2000. That programme of work covers\r\nthemes that, in our opinion, are central to social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn a world that is changing at extraordinary speed, the\r\ncentral phenomenon of our age seems to be rapidly growing\r\ninterdependence, from the globalization of the world\r\neconomy to the information revolution. That being so, does\r\nnot our future depend on equitable and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in all parts of the world? In our view, such\r\ndevelopment depends, in turn, on flows of development\r\nassistance from the better-off to the less developed\r\ncountries and on opening up the world’s markets to trade\r\nand investment, but mainly on the efforts of each individual\r\ncountry to support its own social and economic\r\ndevelopment and to adapt to the fluctuating external\r\nenvironment.\r\nWe believe that the starting point is economic growth.\r\nEconomic growth creates employment, which is by far the\r\nmost effective mechanism for distributing wealth and\r\nopportunity so that both developed and developing countries\r\ncan alleviate poverty. Governments are wont to assume that\r\neconomic growth alone will eventually sort out their social\r\nproblems. However, economic growth alone will not ensure\r\njobs for the long-term unemployed.\r\nStructural changes taking place in the Polish economy,\r\naccompanied by changes in ownership, have already\r\nresulted in significant shifts in the social distribution of\r\nincome. Creation of an economic new deal, however, is not\r\npossible without social approval. Acquiring such approval\r\nfor a structural process is connected, inter alia, with the\r\nneed to initiate activities to prevent the extension of the\r\nsphere of poverty. Upon analysing the sources of poverty\r\nand its extent, it was assumed that support for economic\r\ngrowth, which reduces unemployment by raising labour\r\ndemand, was a method of overcoming poverty as it existed\r\nin Poland. The assumptions with regard to the socio-\r\neconomic development of the country, as formulated in the\r\nlong-term document entitled “Strategy for Poland” and in\r\na supplementary “Programme of socio-economic policy for\r\nthe years 1994-1997,” are in conformity with the\r\nrecommendations that emerged from the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. The multidimensional approach to\r\ndevelopmental problems presented in the “Strategy for\r\nPoland,” including the treatment of social issues,\r\ncorresponds to the commitments entered into during the\r\nSummit.\r\nWith regard to income security, the protection of a\r\nguaranteed minimum wage level within the national\r\neconomy has been established by law. As another element\r\nof the social network aimed at ensuring social safety, we\r\nshould mention activities aimed at halting and then\r\nrestraining unemployment and at providing the\r\nunemployed, during a period delimited by the law, with\r\nthe minimum means of subsistence.\r\nSeveral social guarantees which have been designed\r\nto limit poverty are contained in our universal social\r\ninsurance scheme. In the framework of this scheme, the\r\nState guarantees a source of income in respect to\r\nspecified risks through programmes to promote productive\r\nemployment and decrease unemployment, and to promote\r\nyouth vocational activities. These programmes assume\r\nthat special training and retraining strategies, particularly\r\nfor youth and the long-term unemployed, should be\r\nwidened and made more diverse. They also provide, as a\r\ntarget, the integration of the education system with youth\r\nand adult training, so as to better adjust the manpower\r\nresources structure to the needs of the labour market.\r\nTaking into account the particularly strong influence\r\nof unfavourable economic and social trends upon the\r\ndisabled, since 1994 the Government has implemented a\r\nprogramme to help the disabled and help integrate them\r\ninto the society. Particular support has been given to\r\nvocational rehabilitation and the employment of the\r\ndisabled.\r\nThe Polish social-security system is going through\r\ncomplex reform. The reform is aimed at restructuring the\r\nwhole social-welfare system to ensure that incomes\r\nreceived from work and from social benefits guarantee an\r\nadequate standard of living, and that social assistance is\r\nused only to intervene in special situations. An\r\nunemployment insurance system and a programme to\r\nactively counteract unemployment are being developed,\r\nwith a particular emphasis on the promotion of the\r\neconomic activity of the unemployed in small towns and\r\nin rural areas and of the disabled.\r\nWe believe that the role of civil society in the\r\nfollow-up and implementation process of the World\r\nSummit is highly important. Poland supports the efforts\r\nmade by the Economic and Social Council to stimulate an\r\ninformal dialogue within the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment, inter alia through the use of panels of\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nexperts to discuss with non-governmental organizations the\r\npriority subjects identified at the World Summit. We\r\nsupport the proposal that non-governmental organizations\r\nshould be encouraged to participate in the work of the\r\nCommission.\r\nIt is necessary to increase public awareness of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit and of the results achieved\r\nto date. Nothing can take the place of the United Nations\r\nefforts, not only to emphasize the importance of the\r\nproblems before us but above all to implement what the\r\nSummit recommended in the field of socially oriented\r\ndevelopment. Entering the twenty-first century, our\r\nOrganization — we ourselves — should be able to meet the\r\nchallenge of adding a human dimension to development.\r\nHuman beings are, after all, our primary objective. This\r\nbasic assumption of the Summit should guide us in our\r\ndeliberations on the follow-up of what was decided at\r\nCopenhagen.\r\nMr. Teagarajan (Malaysia): The Malaysian\r\ndelegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, entitled “Implementation of the Outcome of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development” (A/51/348). The\r\nreport provides an important and useful framework for our\r\ndeliberations in this Assembly. My delegation also wishes\r\nto associate itself with the statement made yesterday by the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nNineteen months have passed since our leaders met at\r\nCopenhagen and pledged their commitment to a global\r\npolitical, economic, ethical and spiritual vision for social\r\ndevelopment. Their commitment took into consideration the\r\nvarious religious and ethical values and cultural\r\nbackgrounds of all the peoples around the globe. The\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action\r\nsymbolize this basic compact. If we recall, the following\r\nwere the core issues discussed at the Summit: first, the\r\nreduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute\r\npoverty; secondly, the expansion of productive employment\r\nand the reduction of unemployment; and thirdly, the\r\nenhancement of social integration, particularly of the more\r\ndisadvantaged and marginalized groups.\r\nIn following up on the decisions made at Copenhagen\r\nwe must be guided by the principle of the centrality of\r\npeople in the development process. In the pursuit of social\r\njustice, solidarity, harmony and equality among peoples, the\r\ninternational community must continue to promote the\r\ncause of pluralism and just economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Even as we witness the economic and social\r\nprosperity enjoyed by certain parts of the global\r\ncommunity, we cannot be oblivious to the increasing\r\nnumbers of people in both the North and the South who\r\nare living in abject poverty. It is utterly untenable, indeed\r\ndeplorable, that about 1.3 billion people, a fifth of the\r\nhuman race, still lack access to the most basic necessities\r\nof life such as food and clean drinking water. Therefore,\r\nwe should collectively strive towards an action-oriented\r\nprogramme that seeks to ensure that poverty eradication\r\nis achieved.\r\nWhile the Declaration and Programme of Action of\r\nthe Copenhagen Summit clearly defined the issues\r\nrelating to poverty, employment and social integration, the\r\ncommitments made in respect of international assistance,\r\nofficial development assistance and new additional\r\nresources have regrettably not been fulfilled. At the same\r\ntime, major donor countries have been reluctant to\r\nprovide additional resources. In the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration, donor Governments pledged to strive to\r\nachieve the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct for overall official development assistance as\r\nsoon as possible, and to increase the share of funding for\r\nsocial-development programmes to achieve the objectives\r\nand goals of the Declaration and the Programme of\r\nAction. Unfortunately, the achievement of this target has\r\nbeen far from satisfactory. This is very disheartening. The\r\nmajor donors must live up to the pledges made if they are\r\nto contribute in any meaningful way to alleviating the\r\nplight of the world’s poor and underprivileged.\r\nMy delegation notes the positive involvement of and\r\nthe serious initiatives taken by various actors in the field\r\nof social development — national Governments, the\r\nvarious United Nations organs and bodies, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, regional organizations and the non-\r\ngovernmental actors — in trying to achieve what was\r\nagreed to at the Copenhagen Summit. Clearly all these\r\ninitiatives require adequate resources to make them a\r\nreality. Indeed, unless concrete actions are taken and\r\nfinancial resources found for their execution, the\r\nobservance of 1996 as the International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty will have been rather meaningless.\r\nI am afraid the same fate will befall the proclamation of\r\nthe first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty unless these commitments and pledges are\r\nfulfilled.\r\nMy delegation has noted that the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport refers to the initiatives undertaken by the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions — namely the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund — in pursuance of the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nSummit recommendations, especially in the areas of social\r\ndevelopment and human resource development.\r\nWe welcome the World Bank’s new external finance\r\nfor the social sector, which amounts to $3.33 billion for\r\neducation, health, population programmes and nutrition. We\r\nalso welcome the initiatives by the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund to provide special assistance\r\nto heavily indebted countries. In welcoming these initiatives\r\nwe hope that they are carried out in a fair and just manner.\r\nThese institutions should act neither as the debt collectors\r\nfor the rich North nor as the enforcers of the lenders.\r\nMy delegation wishes to underline the importance of\r\nsocial integration in the context of social development. The\r\nsecurity of the human person demands a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated approach which takes into account all other\r\nfactors, including cultural and religious values and norms.\r\nGiven the vast differences in the level of development\r\nbetween the poorest and least developed countries, those in\r\ntransition economies and those which are highly\r\nindustrialized, due consideration ought to be given to\r\nidentifying and agreeing on the priorities for the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action at the global\r\nlevel. We should be mindful that the priorities and the\r\nmeasures proposed to implement the Programme may not\r\nbe appropriate to all Member States. We should also never\r\nforget that, at the end of the day, the primary responsibility\r\nfor implementing the Summit’s agreed objectives will fall\r\non the individual Member States.\r\nAs for the institutional follow-up, the United Nations\r\nsystem undeniably has a role as a catalyst in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. On the one\r\nhand, the General Assembly should continue formulating\r\nthe overall policies vis-à-vis implementation. The Economic\r\nand Social Council, on the other hand, would provide the\r\noverall guidance and oversee system-wide coordination in\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Summit and\r\nmake recommendations in that regard within the United\r\nNations system. The coordinating role played by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in bringing the agencies\r\ninvolved in the implementation of the Programme of Action\r\ninto a closer working relationship would ensure the\r\navoidance of duplication of responsibilities.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate Malaysia’s\r\ncommitment to the pledge made by the world’s leaders at\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen\r\nin 1995. This is reflected in the various Government\r\npolicies and programmes which are well established and\r\nbroadly supported by the people. In addition, the\r\nadministrative machinery and processes for implementing,\r\nmonitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of those\r\npolicies are also very much in place and are generally\r\nfunctioning in an effective fashion.\r\nThrough its socio-economic policies and programme\r\nfor development Malaysia has been able to reduce\r\ndrastically the incidence of poverty, to achieve virtually\r\nfull employment, and to strengthen social integration and\r\nunity. This will continue to be one of the thrusts of the\r\nseventh Malaysia Plan for 1996 to 2000.\r\nMr. de Rojas (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Venezuela endorses the statements made on this\r\nagenda item by the delegation of Bolivia, on behalf of the\r\nRio Group, and by the delegation of Costa Rica, on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela also wishes to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on the implementation\r\nof the outcome of the Copenhagen World Summit for\r\nSocial Development (A/51/348), and to express its support\r\nfor its contents.\r\nMy country is aware of the dramatic growth of\r\npoverty and the spread of new forms of exclusion which\r\nthreaten human dignity of most of the citizens of the\r\nworld. We consider social development a crucial\r\nchallenge of our time. The Venezuelan Government\r\ntherefore maintains that future generations’ judgment of\r\nour time will depend on our ability to address\r\nsuccessfully the challenges of poverty and social\r\nexclusion.\r\nThe convening of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment renewed the hope of the Government and\r\nthe people of Venezuela. Following the Summit we\r\nimmediately decided to take action to follow up the\r\nagreements reached at that landmark social forum. This\r\nwas in accordance with what was laid down at the\r\nSummit, whereby it was stressed that national\r\nGovernments are the actors responsible for bringing about\r\nthe goals of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action.\r\nMy country’s new strategy in the social area has\r\nbeen designed not only in terms of our own activities in\r\nthat area; rather, it forms part of the State’s new\r\neconomic policy: “Agenda Venezuela”. In this agenda the\r\noperation of the productive apparatus itself is expected to\r\ngenerate greater equity.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nOne of the important components of this commitment\r\nto social solidarity is raising the capacity for organization\r\nin order to generate the ability among the most\r\ndisadvantaged part of the population to obtain its fair share\r\nof the social product. The promotion of community\r\norganizations is in keeping with this line of action. We\r\nshould also stress that this social commitment involves\r\ncontinuation of family supplementary income systems. As\r\nsocial programmes require time to be established and to\r\nmature, they should not be dismantled or replaced until\r\nbetter and more efficient alternatives are found.\r\nMy country has assumed the responsibility to diminish\r\npoverty in the short term through social and economic\r\nstrategies geared not only towards meeting basic physical\r\nneeds such as health, nutrition, education and work, but\r\nwhich are also aimed at defending human rights and\r\npromoting the equitable distribution of income and wealth.\r\nThis commitment implies activities in three specific areas.\r\nThe first involves promoting the development of a system\r\nof social and household services for low-income families\r\nthrough programmes of family and student subsidies and\r\ncare for the elderly. The second involves reviewing the\r\nlegal framework and administrative procedures to ensure\r\naccess by the most disadvantaged to economic, financial\r\nand technological resources, in order to join fully the labour\r\nmarket. The third involves promoting programmes for\r\nqualification and training to orient the labour force towards\r\nnon-traditional activities.\r\nRegionally, Venezuela has supported all of the\r\ninitiatives of the Rio Group aimed at ensuring the full\r\nfollow-up of the commitments of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. Accordingly, we have been working\r\nclosely with the countries of that Group to implement the\r\nprovisions of the Buenos Aires declaration on fulfilment of\r\nthe commitments of the Summit, and of its annex, which\r\nsets out the regional follow-up programme. Both documents\r\nreflect the imperative need to eradicate poverty as a key\r\nelement of our region’s social agenda.\r\nIn this context, Venezuela welcomed the\r\nrecommendation of the Rio Group on the lead body for\r\ncoordination of the follow-up of activities in the social\r\nsphere. In so doing it designated as national coordinator the\r\nMinistry of Family Affairs, as the governmental agency\r\nentrusted with the design and execution of social policies.\r\nAt the same time, it invited civil society to take part in this\r\nendeavour.\r\nAt the hemispheric level, during the Summit of the\r\nAmericas Venezuela reiterated the priority importance it\r\nattaches to the social sphere and gave its support to the\r\nconvening of the Hemispheric Conference on the\r\nEradication of Poverty and Discrimination held in January\r\n1996 at Santiago, Chile.\r\nAccordingly, the Government of Venezuela worked\r\nwith countries of the hemisphere to identify innovative\r\nand creative measures to attack poverty through focused\r\nnational programmes, the formulation of goals, and\r\nreform of the social sectors within the process of\r\nmodernization of the State.\r\nMy Government believes it is imperative to support\r\nthe idea of international social justice. To this end, each\r\nand every member of the international community must\r\ndo its part towards what we refer to as the universal\r\ncommon good. With this idea in mind, it becomes ever\r\nmore imperative to review the terms of the external debt\r\nthat weighs heavily upon the developing countries and\r\nmakes it difficult to meet the demands of development.\r\nVenezuela believes it is encouraging for the\r\ninternational community that the United Nations is\r\nresponsibly addressing the subject of social development\r\ntoday, more earnestly than ever, as we come to the end of\r\nthe twentieth century. This has been further buttressed by\r\nthe Organization’s recent world conferences geared to the\r\nsocial sphere, which also demonstrates that this is a\r\ncomplex task requiring a multidisciplinary, coordinated\r\napproach with an important ethical component. We hope\r\nthat implementation of the outcome of the Summit will\r\ngive renewed impetus to cooperation between countries\r\nand international organizations in order comprehensively\r\nto achieve development, justice and peace.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThere are no further speakers on this item. The draft\r\nresolution to be submitted under agenda item 45 will be\r\nconsidered at a later date to be announced.\r\nReports of the Fifth Committee\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe General Assembly will now consider the reports of\r\nthe Fifth Committee on agenda items 126, 133 and 135.\r\nIf there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly\r\ndecides not to discuss the reports of the Fifth Committee\r\nwhich are before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the recommendations\r\nof the Fifth Committee have been made clear in the\r\nCommittee and are reflected in the relevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401 the Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered in a\r\nMain Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation\r\nshould, as far as possible, explain its vote only once,\r\ni.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting\r\nunless that delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is\r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee”.\r\nMay I also remind delegations that, also in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner\r\nas was done in the Committee.\r\nAgenda item 126\r\nFinancing of the United Nations Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/51/502)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\nresolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 6 of its report (A/51/502).\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted by the Fifth\r\nCommittee without a vote. May I consider that the\r\nAssembly too wishes to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 51/2).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nagenda item 126.\r\nAgenda item 133\r\nFinancing of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nGeorgia\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/51/503)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\ndecision recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 6 of its report (A/51/503).\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft decision\r\nwithout a vote. May I consider that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do likewise?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nagenda item 133.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 17 October 1996\r\nAgenda item 135\r\nFinancing of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nLiberia\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/51/504)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\nresolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 6 of its report (A/51/504).\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted in the Fifth\r\nCommittee without a vote.
