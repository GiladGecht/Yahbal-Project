(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\nThe President: This morning the General Assembly\r\nwill proceed to the election of five non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council to replace those members whose\r\nterm of office expires on 31 December 1996.\r\nThe five non-permanent outgoing members are the\r\nfollowing: Botswana, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia and\r\nItaly. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore\r\ntheir names should not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the Security\r\nCouncil will include in 1997 the following States: Chile,\r\nEgypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea.\r\nThe names of those States, therefore, should also not appear\r\non the ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members which will remain\r\nin office in 1997 three are from Africa and Asia, one is\r\nfrom Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of\r\n17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members\r\nshould be elected according to the following pattern: two\r\nfrom Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean and two from Western European and other\r\nStates. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is an\r\nunderstanding to the effect that, of the two States to be\r\nelected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa\r\nand one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\nnumber of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats\r\nto be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of those present and voting will be\r\ndeclared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nwhich have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 21 October 1996\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballots, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed that for\r\nthe two vacancies from among the African and Asian\r\nStates, there are three candidates, namely India, Japan and\r\nKenya. Kenya has been endorsed by the group of African\r\nStates.\r\nAs for the Latin American and Caribbean States, there\r\nare two candidates for one vacancy. The two candidates are\r\nBolivia and Costa Rica.\r\nFrom among the Western European and other States,\r\nthere are three candidates for two vacancies: Australia,\r\nPortugal and Sweden.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nwe shall proceed now to the election by secret ballot.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed and to write on them the\r\nnames of the five States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will\r\nbe declared invalid. Names on a ballot paper of Member\r\nStates which do not belong to that region will not be\r\ncounted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Braha\r\n(Albania), Mr. Iragorri (Colombia) and Mr. Gwary\r\n(Nigeria) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10:30 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11:50 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting for the\r\nelection of the five non-permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil is as follows:\r\nGroup A — African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 181\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 180\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of Members voting: 180\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 120\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nKenya 172\r\nJapan 142\r\nIndia 40\r\nGroup B — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 181\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 181\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumbers of Members voting: 180\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 120\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCosta Rica 105\r\nBolivia 73\r\nColumbia 1\r\nDominican Republic 1\r\nGroup C — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 181\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 181\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumbers of Members voting: 181\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 121\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSweden 153\r\nPortugal 112\r\nAustralia 91\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nthe following States were elected non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council for a two-year\r\nperiod beginning 1 January 1997: Japan, Kenya and\r\nSweden.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States which have\r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council.\r\nThe representative of Bolivia has asked to speak on\r\na point of order, and I call on him now.\r\nMr. Camacho Omiste (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Bolivia signed a fair and\r\nfraternal agreement with the delegation of Costa Rica to\r\nthe effect that support would be given to the delegation\r\nobtaining the larger number of votes in the first round.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 21 October 1996\r\nThe first round having been completed with a result\r\nfavourable to Costa Rica, I am pleased and honoured to say\r\nthat my delegation withdraws its candidature in this second\r\nround and supports the candidature of Costa Rica for a non-\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council. The delegation of\r\nBolivia wishes to express thanks for the support it received\r\nfrom the delegations that voted for us. We shall be faithful\r\nto the commitments we have assumed with delegations on\r\nthis occasion.\r\nThe President: I thank the representative of Bolivia\r\nfor his cooperation. In accordance with the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall proceed now to a restricted ballot,\r\ntaking into account the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Bolivia.\r\nThere remain two seats to be filled: one from among\r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States and one from\r\namong the Western European and Other States.
