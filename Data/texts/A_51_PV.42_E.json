(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 14\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the Agency (A/51/307)\r\nDraft resolution (A/51/L.9)\r\nAmendments (A/51/L.10, A/51/L.11 and A/51/L.12)\r\nThe President: Before calling on the first speaker, I\r\nshould like to propose, if there are no objections, that the\r\nlist of speakers for the debate on this item be closed at\r\n12 noon today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now invite the Director General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr. Hans Blix, to\r\npresent the report of the Agency for the year 1995.\r\nMr. Blix (International Atomic Energy Agency): It is\r\nan honour for me, on the occasion of the submission of the\r\nannual report of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) for 1995, to address the General Assembly and give\r\nan up-to-date account of the activities and concerns that\r\nengage the IAEA.\r\nOne hundred years ago, the French professor Henri\r\nBecquerel discovered radioactivity. Some 50 years later,\r\nat the end of the Second World War, two nuclear bombs\r\nwere launched over Japan, demonstrating the destructive\r\npower of nuclear energy. Ten years later the peaceful\r\npotential of nuclear energy came to the fore at the first\r\nInternational Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic\r\nEnergy at Geneva. Much of the secrecy that had\r\nsurrounded nuclear science during and after the war was\r\nlifted, which led to widespread optimism about the\r\npotential benefits of the various uses of nuclear energy.\r\nSince then a nervous world has watched the\r\nbelligerent atom during some 2,000 nuclear-weapons tests\r\nand a nuclear armaments race. In the same period there\r\nhas been rapid development and deployment of the\r\nbeneficial uses of nuclear energy to generate electricity,\r\nto combat cancer and help diagnostics, to improve food\r\nproduction, and to measure and reduce pollution — to\r\nmention but a few uses.\r\nThroughout this period the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) has served member States by\r\nhelping to compile nuclear-relevant data, to disseminate\r\nknowledge and know-how about peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy, to draft common radiation protection and other\r\nsafety standards, and to verify that nuclear material under\r\ninternational safeguards is used only for peaceful\r\npurposes. Over time the work of the Agency has both\r\nexpanded and changed considerably. Governmental\r\ninvolvement in the promotion of nuclear science has\r\ngiven way somewhat to emphasis on regulatory work in\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nthe fields of the safe use of nuclear installations and the\r\nsafe disposal of nuclear waste. A similar change of\r\nemphasis has occurred also in the IAEA. While some of the\r\nprovisions of the IAEA Statute concerning ownership and\r\noperation of nuclear installations — for instance, for the\r\nstorage of plutonium — may have been overambitious and\r\nremain unused so far, the rule of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) obliging parties to\r\nsubmit all their present and future nuclear activities to\r\nIAEA safeguards has resulted in a sizeable verification\r\nactivity of growing importance. Development cooperation,\r\nbased both on the IAEA Statute and called for under the\r\nNPT, has similarly become a large activity. However,\r\nfinancing from the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), which was once a large source of\r\nfunding for IAEA technical cooperation, has now become\r\na minor source. Moreover, the orientation of programmes\r\nhas shifted somewhat from basic nuclear science and\r\ntechnology to projects with more direct impact on\r\nsustainable development: increased food production,\r\nidentification of water resources, eradication of insect pests,\r\ndevelopment of new plant mutants, and so forth.\r\nAs the world changes and the problems facing\r\nGovernments change, intergovernmental organizations,\r\nwhich are their joint tools, must also change. Moreover,\r\nunforeseen events influence the agendas of Governments,\r\nand this is reflected also in the agenda of the IAEA. It\r\nsuffices to mention the names Three Mile Island and\r\nChernobyl, Iraq and the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea (DPRK), Semipalatinsk and Mururoa, to evoke the\r\ngrowing engagement of the IAEA in the fields of nuclear\r\nsafety, safeguards verification and assessment of the\r\nradiological situation at nuclear-weapons test sites.\r\nChange is occurring also in the methods and\r\ntechniques used by the IAEA to fulfil its functions.\r\nInformation compiled by the Agency from member\r\nStates — for instance, on the operation of nuclear\r\ninstallations — is now processed electronically and often\r\nmade available on line not only to member Governments\r\nbut to all interested parties. To take an example, INIS, or\r\nthe International Nuclear Information System, is a truly\r\ninternational bibliography of material published in the\r\nnuclear field. It is available on line. I might further mention\r\nthat, although meetings of the Agency’s Board of\r\nGovernors are closed and the records restricted, under a\r\nrecent decision practically all Board documentation older\r\nthan two years is declassified and will soon be available to\r\nall on line. In addition, a home page on the Internet now\r\noffers a wealth of information about the Agency and its\r\ncurrent work. In the safeguards field, the control of nuclear\r\nmaterial is being made more effective and efficient by the\r\nuse of remote monitoring and automatic transmission of\r\ndata. Another innovation is a direct line between the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and myself to\r\nensure rapid communication in case of crisis. The Agency\r\nhas also indicated its readiness to have a televised link to\r\nthe Security Council to enable the Council to be briefed\r\nat any time without delay. So far the need has not been\r\nfelt for this, but a practice of informal briefings for the\r\nCouncil is developing, thus ensuring close liaison between\r\nthe nuclear inspection arm of the United Nations system\r\nand the enforcement organ.\r\nIt is possible that continuous change and adaptation\r\nhave been made easier within the IAEA by the practice of\r\nthe Agency of rotating most professional staff. Long-term\r\nstaff are most valuable for stability, experience and\r\ninstitutional memory, but for flexibility in programming,\r\nfor innovation and for awareness of current problems in\r\nthe field and their possible solutions, a steady inflow and\r\noutflow of professional staff has proved helpful in the\r\ncase of the IAEA.\r\nThere is no lack of challenges in the nuclear sphere\r\nand member Governments would want the organization to\r\nrespond to many of these. The problem is that the zero-\r\nreal-growth policy, combined with the difficulty of\r\nabandoning existing essential programmes and of making\r\nsufficient resources available through economies, limits\r\nwhat can be tackled. Many new tasks — for instance,\r\nmeasures countering illicit trafficking in nuclear materials\r\nor ad hoc projects concerning nuclear safety and waste —\r\nare, in fact, handled in large measure on the basis of\r\nextrabudgetary voluntary contributions. This is not\r\nsatisfactory, but is far better than inaction.\r\nLet me now turn to some of the challenges currently\r\nfacing the IAEA. With the nuclear arms race over, a\r\nnumber of nuclear arms control or disarmament treaties\r\nhave been concluded or are in the making. I shall soon\r\naddress the verification tasks which this may place on the\r\nIAEA, but at this point I would like to pose the important\r\nquestion of whether putting the evil genie of the\r\nbelligerent atom back into the bottle will contribute to a\r\nmore general acceptance of the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy, in particular the exploitation of the potential for\r\nthe generation of electricity and heat. It is too early to\r\nknow the answer, but it is not too early to recognize its\r\nimportance.\r\nAmong the vital issues facing the world is the risk\r\nof global warming caused by excessive emissions of some\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\ngases, linked in large measure to energy use: notably\r\ncarbon dioxide and methane. The Framework Convention\r\non Climate Change, signed at the Rio Conference in 1992,\r\ndid not specify how the risk is to be met. While the United\r\nNations system has at its disposal a group of prominent\r\nscientific experts in climatology — the Intergovernmental\r\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) — which examines the\r\nproblems, probability and causes of climate change, the\r\nsystem does not have any single organization providing\r\nimpartial expert data and analysis of different sources of\r\nenergy. As a result, some of the energy scenarios designed\r\nby the IPCC in response to the risk of global warming are\r\nquestioned by outside experts.\r\nAt the IAEA the goal of sustainable development is\r\nfully accepted, and it has been considered important that all\r\nenergy sources be impartially and scientifically analysed for\r\ntheir impact upon life, health and the environment,\r\nincluding climate. For this reason cooperation has been\r\nsought with several other international organizations in a\r\njoint project, known as DECADES, dealing with electricity\r\ngeneration. The project develops methods and software\r\nthrough which individual countries are able to assess and\r\ncompare the health and environmental impact, as well as\r\nthe cost, of different ways of generating electricity, taking\r\ninto account the full cycle — that is to say, from the\r\nextraction of fuel to the disposal of waste. Not surprisingly,\r\nthese analyses show that the fossil fuels — coal, oil and\r\ngas, in this order — are at the top of the scale of energy\r\nsources contributing greenhouse gases — particularly\r\ncarbon dioxide — while nuclear power and renewable\r\nsources of energy contribute the least greenhouse gases.\r\nThese findings are entirely consistent with the experience\r\nreported by Mr. Priddle, the Head of the International\r\nEnergy Agency (IEA) of the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD), at the second\r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, held in Geneva last\r\nsummer. Mr. Priddle observed that:\r\n“Nuclear power accounted for the greater part of the\r\nlowering of the carbon intensity of the energy\r\neconomies of the OECD countries”.\r\nThere should now be a general awareness among\r\nGovernments that an expanded use of nuclear power and of\r\nrenewable sources of energy, together with conservation\r\nmeasures, could significantly help to restrain greenhouse\r\ngas emissions. Regrettably, this has not yet led to common\r\nconclusions at the global level. A few Governments — in\r\nJapan, the Republic of Korea, China and in Eastern\r\nEurope — expressly refer to environmental concerns in\r\nexplaining their expanded use of nuclear power. However,\r\nat present most countries are continuing to expand their\r\nuse of fossil fuels and are failing to meet the targets\r\nwhich they have set for themselves to restrain their\r\nemissions of greenhouse gases. There is a regrettable gap\r\nbetween the rhetoric of restraint and the reality of\r\ngrowing greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nThe reason why nuclear power expansion is not very\r\nactively discussed by most Governments — despite its\r\nsignificant potential as a response to the risk of global\r\nwarming — lies in the controversy that surrounds this\r\nsource of energy in many industrial countries. Although\r\nnuclear arms control and disarmament will eliminate one\r\npast common concern, others remain, notably regarding\r\nsafety in nuclear power operation, safety in nuclear waste\r\ndisposal and illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. The\r\nIAEA is actively engaged in all these subjects.\r\nWith regard to nuclear safety, the accident at\r\nChernobyl in 1986 had very serious consequences for\r\nhuman health and the environment and a major negative\r\nimpact on the further expansion of nuclear power. This\r\nmakes it all the more important that all the lessons be\r\ndrawn that can be drawn from this tragic event. On the\r\ntenth anniversary of the accident, the IAEA, the World\r\nHealth Organization and the European Commission\r\nco-sponsored an international conference last April to sum\r\nup the results of the various assessments made and\r\nspecialized meetings held on the consequences of the\r\naccident. It attracted the participation of over 800 experts\r\nfrom 71 countries and concluded with a remarkable\r\ndegree of consensus. Among the conclusions was a\r\nconfirmation of a significant increase in the incidence of\r\nthyroid cancer among children born before and within\r\nsome months after the accident. No increase in any other\r\nform of cancer has been identified. The social and\r\npsychological consequences of the accident, combined\r\nwith the consequences of the political and economic\r\nchanges, have been severe. At the technical level renewed\r\nattention must be paid to the “sarcophagus” around this\r\ndestroyed reactor. The question of the closure of the\r\nwhole Chernobyl plant needs also to be conclusively\r\nsettled.\r\nA Summit of eight States on Nuclear Safety and\r\nSecurity was held in Moscow on 19-20 April 1996. It\r\nresulted inter alia in recognition of the importance of\r\nnuclear power as an energy source that is consistent with\r\nthe goal of sustainable development and in commitments\r\nto an international nuclear safety culture, as well as to\r\nstrengthening the IAEA safeguards system. Needless to\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nsay, this attention at the highest levels to nuclear matters is\r\nof great importance as guidance both to those working in\r\nthe nuclear sphere and to the general public.\r\nLast week on United Nations Day, 24 October, the\r\nIAEA Convention on Nuclear Safety entered into force.\r\nWhile recognizing that national authorities have the\r\nresponsibility for supervising the safety of nuclear power\r\nplants, this Convention lays down a number of basic\r\nprinciples which must be respected. It also provides a\r\nprocedure under which the parties are obliged to submit\r\nreports on the safety of nuclear power plants on their\r\nterritory and to accept review of these reports by other\r\nStates.\r\nIn the coming year three new legal instruments\r\nrelevant to safety are expected to be finalized. A new\r\nconvention will contain basic rules concerning the safe\r\nmanagement, including disposal, of radioactive waste. Like\r\nthe Convention on Nuclear Safety, it will oblige parties to\r\nsubmit periodic reports on implementation and to accept\r\nreview of them by States parties. Other instruments will\r\nbring about a revision of the Vienna Convention on Civil\r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage and an arrangement for\r\nsupplementary funding.\r\nThe development of conventions and other legal\r\ninstruments and standards, together with a variety of\r\ninternational services and assistance programmes, and\r\nheightened national attention to nuclear safety, help to\r\nestablish the international nuclear safety culture to which\r\nthe participants in the Moscow Summit committed\r\nthemselves. Results of the efforts to strengthen nuclear\r\nsafety can be seen in the reduced number of unplanned\r\nstoppages in nuclear power plants around the world.\r\nBefore I move on to discuss the IAEA’s various tasks\r\nrelating to the belligerent atom, I must touch briefly on the\r\nAgency’s work in disseminating nuclear techniques to\r\ndeveloping countries. I referred in my introduction to the\r\nchanges that have occurred in the IAEA’s programme of\r\ndevelopment cooperation, and in particular the shift in\r\nemphasis from basic research to projects that promote\r\nsustainable development and benefit the end user — for\r\ninstance, the cancer patient or the farmer. I am pleased to\r\nreport also that by raising the level of ambition and through\r\nbetter management, it has been possible to reach record\r\nhigh levels of programme delivery. Let me give but two\r\nexamples of projects, both in Africa.\r\nWater resources management is essential for\r\nsustainable development, and isotope hydrology techniques\r\nhave unique capabilities to trace and map water resources\r\nso that best use can be made of them. Within a major\r\nregional project in Africa, the IAEA is helping to apply\r\nthese techniques. For instance, the Moyale region in south\r\nEthiopia, covering 45,000 square kilometres, which has\r\nthree million inhabitants and one of the largest cattle\r\nherds on the continent, depends entirely on scarce\r\ngroundwater resources. Isotopic data have now made it\r\npossible to distinguish between renewable and\r\nnon-renewable water resources, leading to better estimates\r\nof the total sustainable capacity for meeting water\r\nrequirements in this region.\r\nThe other example I want to mention relates to the\r\nuse of radiation in the eradication of some insect pests\r\nthat affect food production and health. The sterilization of\r\ncertain insects, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly and the\r\ntsetse fly, and the release of large quantities of sterile\r\nmales make it possible, after unsuccessful campaigns with\r\nconventional means, actually to eradicate an insect pest.\r\nThus, through a major effort by the IAEA and the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO) a few years ago, the New World screwworm was\r\neradicated in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Right now the\r\nfocus is on a very promising project to eradicate the tsetse\r\nfly from Zanzibar in the United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nthereby permitting better cattle-rearing on the island. The\r\naim is complete eradication before the end of 1997. The\r\nexpected successful outcome is likely to stimulate similar\r\nprojects in some larger sites in Africa.\r\nI turn now to the growing role of the IAEA to help\r\nprevent a further spread of nuclear weapons and to verify\r\nnuclear arms control and disarmament agreements. The\r\nmost important event in this field during the past year\r\nwas undoubtedly the recent adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the convention prohibiting all nuclear\r\nweapons tests. Although there was considerable discussion\r\nduring the negotiations in Geneva about the possible\r\nfinancial and other advantages of using the IAEA to run\r\nthe verification activities under the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and to provide the\r\nsecretariat, the solution eventually adopted was a small\r\nseparate organization to be located in Vienna. At this\r\njuncture it is difficult to know whether simple co-location,\r\nwelcome as it is, will offer much by way of synergy.\r\nWhile there is some uncertainty about the formal entry\r\ninto force of the CTBT, it is worth noting that all\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are already\r\nobliged under the NPT not only to refrain from nuclear\r\nweapons tests, but also from preparing for such tests, and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nthe IAEA has the duty to verify in those States that these\r\nobligations are respected.\r\nThe dominant verification task of the IAEA consists\r\nin the operation of comprehensive safeguards under the\r\nNPT and nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. The 180\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States now party to the NPT have\r\ncommitted themselves to conclude comprehensive\r\nsafeguards agreements with the IAEA. I regret to report\r\nthat, despite periodic reminders, over 50 of these States\r\nhave yet to do so.\r\nTreaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones are\r\nincreasing in number and play an important role in\r\nconsolidating commitments to non-proliferation on a\r\nregional basis and in providing specific supplementary\r\narrangements and undertakings responding to needs of the\r\nparticular region. All of them rely on the IAEA for\r\nverification. The Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of\r\nTlatelolco) will hopefully enter into force for its entire zone\r\nof application during the next year. The Pelindaba Text of\r\nthe African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty signed in\r\nCairo last April, which establishes a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone for Africa, goes further than the NPT. For example, it\r\nprohibits any armed attacks against nuclear installations.\r\nSimilarly, the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\r\nTreaty, signed in Bangkok last December, goes beyond\r\nnon-proliferation and deals also with issues of nuclear trade,\r\nnuclear safety and radioactive waste.\r\nA nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East has\r\nbeen on the agenda of the United Nations and of the IAEA\r\nfor a number of years. The General Conference of the\r\nIAEA has requested me to consult with countries in the\r\nregion concerning the verification issues linked to such a\r\nzone. From my many discussions in the region, I conclude\r\nthat existing comprehensive safeguards alone will not\r\nsuffice as means of verification. Most likely, some\r\ncombination of international and regional or bilateral\r\narrangements will have to be worked out. I have been\r\nrequested to convene a second workshop on these\r\nverification issues in 1997, and I shall do so.\r\nThe Agency’s verification of Iraq’s compliance with\r\nits obligations under the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions has, since August 1994, involved more than 600\r\ninspections, the majority of which were conducted without\r\nprior notice. These inspections, plus the analysis of the vast\r\namount of documentation handed over to the IAEA and to\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) after the\r\ndeparture of the late Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel\r\nHassan Al-Majid and the follow-up of procurement\r\ntransactions, are part of the assessment of Iraq’s reissued\r\nfull, final and complete declaration of its former nuclear\r\nweapons programme. The carrying out of joint\r\nIAEA-UNSCOM multidisciplinary inspections at\r\nweapons-capable sites contributes to the effectiveness of\r\nthe ongoing monitoring and verification programme for\r\nthe detection of any attempts by Iraq to conduct activities\r\nproscribed by the Security Council resolutions.\r\nIn the case of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea (DPRK), the information and access provided to us\r\nhave been and remain insufficient for a comprehensive\r\npicture of the nuclear programme, and questions remain\r\nabout the completeness of the initial declaration of\r\nnuclear activities. Although present verification\r\narrangements give confidence that nuclear installations\r\nsubjected to a freeze under the agreed framework between\r\nthe United States and the DPRK are actually frozen,\r\nconfidence about the DPRK’s compliance with its\r\nnon-proliferation commitments under the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) can only\r\ncome about through more information and full\r\nimplementation of the safeguards agreement.\r\nA considerable strengthening of NPT-type safeguards\r\nbecame acceptable and was, indeed, demanded by most\r\nGovernments after the discovery of clandestine nuclear\r\nweapons activities in Iraq. In particular, greater assurance\r\nwas sought regarding non-declared nuclear material and\r\nactivities related to such material. It was clear that such\r\nassurances could only be obtained by giving the IAEA\r\naccess to more information, by allowing inspectors greater\r\naccess to relevant sites and by introducing new\r\ntechniques, such as analysis of environmental samples.\r\nMany of the measures contemplated have been\r\nintroduced under the authority given to the Agency under\r\nexisting comprehensive safeguards agreements. For the\r\nintroduction of measures which may go beyond the\r\nauthority given in these agreements, an additional draft\r\nprotocol has been worked out by the secretariat and is\r\nnow the subject of discussion in a committee under the\r\nBoard of Governors. Most of the measures now being\r\ndiscussed have been tried out in several industrialized\r\nStates without great problems for the Agency or for the\r\nState concerned. Although these measures will, in the\r\nlong run, bring efficiency gains and be cost-neutral, it is\r\ninevitable that they will also add some burden and\r\ninconvenience to the inspected party. Regrettably, as we\r\nall know from our experience of controls at airports,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nsecurity against possible violations by a few requires some\r\ninconveniencing of many.\r\nOne of the objections currently raised to the proposed\r\nstrengthened safeguards system is that it unfairly exempts\r\nnuclear-weapon States from measures which are seen as\r\nburdensome by some of the non-nuclear-weapon States\r\nrequired to accept them. As disarmament progresses, such\r\ninequality of burden should diminish. Verification in States\r\nthat still have nuclear weapons obviously cannot aim at\r\nestablishing the absence of nuclear weapons, which is the\r\npurpose of the strengthened safeguards system. However,\r\nverification in nuclear-weapon States could aim at providing\r\nassurance that fissionable material from dismantled\r\nweapons does not go into new weapons and that a cut-off\r\nagreement prohibiting the production of plutonium or highly\r\nenriched uranium for weapons use is respected.\r\nA cut-off agreement remains to be negotiated.\r\nMeanwhile the United States and Russia are, in fact,\r\ndismantling nuclear weapons, and the Moscow Nuclear\r\nSafety and Security Summit last April endorsed the idea of\r\nIAEA verification that material from dismantled weapons\r\nand other military stocks remains in peaceful storage or use.\r\nThe IAEA is, in fact, already safeguarding some such\r\nmaterial in the United States, and Russia appears willing to\r\naccept similar inspections in due course. At a recent\r\ntrilateral meeting of the Russian Minister of Atomic\r\nEnergy, the United States Secretary of Energy and myself\r\non the occasion of the IAEA General Conference, it was\r\nagreed jointly to explore technical, safeguards-related and\r\nfinancial issues which are connected with such verification.\r\nIt is my hope that we are here witnessing the first steps\r\ntowards verification of nuclear disarmament.\r\nOne final word of caution is needed after this\r\noptimistic note: even with a keen eye to efficiency, the\r\nmanagement of multilateral nuclear cooperation, including\r\nverification of arms control and disarmament, requires\r\nresources: well-qualified personnel, state-of-the-art\r\nequipment, and so on. Without adequate funding such\r\npersonnel cannot be recruited or retained, and the purchase\r\nof advanced, cost-effective equipment will be curtailed.\r\nIn concluding let me express appreciation to the\r\nGovernment of Austria for its continued support of United\r\nNations system organizations in Vienna.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of\r\nCanada to introduce draft resolution A/51/L.9.\r\nMr. Fowler (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the sponsors, Canada is pleased to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/51/L.9 on the report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This draft resolution\r\nreflects the significant developments that have taken place\r\nin the work of the Agency since 1995 under the steady\r\nand capable direction of its Director General, Mr. Hans\r\nBlix.\r\nThe Director General has provided visionary\r\nleadership over the last 16 years. He is to be commended\r\nfor his unwavering promotion of the safe and regulated\r\ntransfer of nuclear technology, and his defence of the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation objectives of IAEA safeguards.\r\nThis delicate balancing act was always achieved with the\r\nutmost degree of professionalism and diplomacy. We\r\nwelcome his comments this morning and thank him for\r\nyet another comprehensive report.\r\nThe Agency’s dedication to maintaining a balance\r\nbetween technical cooperation, safeguards and nuclear\r\nsafety — the three pillars of the Agency — is\r\nnoteworthy, and the draft resolution makes every attempt\r\nto mirror this equilibrium.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nPlease permit me to draw attention to some of the\r\nmore significant elements of this year’s draft resolution.\r\nThe richness of the discussions within the Agency and\r\namong its members on the technical cooperation activities\r\nof the Agency is reflected in this resolution. In particular,\r\nwe have included in this year’s text the thought expressed\r\nin IAEA General Conference resolution GC(40)/RES/13,\r\nregarding the strengthening of Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation activities related to the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. Examples of such contributions made by\r\nthe IAEA include important work on food irradiation,\r\nmedical isotopes and pest control.\r\nIn addition, there is a new and, we think, welcome\r\nreference to the need for the Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation activities to contribute to sustainable\r\ndevelopment in developing countries. The Agency’s\r\nefforts in the production of potable water are particularly\r\nnoteworthy in this regard.\r\nThe important decision of the Board of Governors to\r\nestablish a committee to draft a protocol to strengthen the\r\neffectiveness and improve the efficiency of the nuclear\r\nsafeguards system is also reflected in the draft resolution.\r\nWe are aware that a strong commitment to nuclear safety\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\npractices is paramount if nuclear energy is to continue into\r\nthe twenty-first century. In this connection, we were\r\npleased to welcome the entry into force of the Convention\r\non Nuclear Safety, on United Nations Day, 24 October\r\n1996. This is the first year in which such a reference has\r\nbeen included in the draft resolution. The significance of\r\nthis Convention to all States cannot be overstated.\r\nThe important work being done on a Convention on\r\nthe Safety of Radioactive Waste Management is also\r\nhighlighted — for the first time — in this year’s draft\r\nresolution.\r\nIt is important that this draft resolution on the\r\nAgency’s annual report receive wide support. We all have\r\na common interest in ensuring that the work of the Agency\r\nin all areas receives due recognition.\r\nFinally, on behalf of the sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution, which now include Japan, The former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Turkey and Ukraine, Canada is\r\npleased to put this text forward. We believe that this draft\r\nresolution accurately represents the activities of the Agency,\r\nand we have worked with all members in Vienna and New\r\nYork to develop a text which could attract consensus. We\r\nhope that this draft resolution will, indeed, be adopted with\r\nthe broadest possible support.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of Egypt\r\nto introduce an amendment to draft resolution A/51/L.9,\r\ncontained in document A/51/L.10.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I am pleased to speak today\r\nto introduce the amendment proposed by Egypt, contained\r\nin document A/51/L.10, to the draft resolution (A/51/L.9)\r\njust introduced by Permanent Representative of Canada on\r\nagenda item 14, entitled “Report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency”.\r\nBefore I proceed with the introduction of my\r\namendment, I would like first of all to express my\r\ndelegation’s sincere appreciation to Mr. Hans Blix, the\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), for his comprehensive introduction of the\r\nreport of the Agency on its activities for last year. I would\r\nalso like to pay tribute to the delegation of Canada for\r\npreparing, negotiating and presenting, on behalf of the\r\nsponsors, the draft resolution on this agenda item, and\r\nparticularly for its repeated attempts to accommodate our\r\nproposal in the main text of the draft — which, for certain\r\nobvious reasons, was not possible.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is fraught with\r\nincreasing anxiety and concern as a result of an\r\nambiguous Israeli nuclear programme and the refusal of\r\nIsrael to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) or to place its nuclear facilities\r\nunder full-scope IAEA safeguards. This situation was\r\nsubject to thorough discussion at the last IAEA General\r\nConference, in September 1996. The Conference accepted\r\nby consensus a statement by the President of the\r\nConference on 20 September 1996 relating to agenda item\r\n23 of the General Conference on application of Agency\r\nsafeguards in the Middle East, which requested the\r\nDirector General to invite experts from the Middle East\r\nand other areas to a technical workshop on safeguards,\r\nverification technologies and related experiences.\r\nIn view of the urgent need for extensive IAEA\r\nefforts in the fields mentioned in the statement,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East, my delegation believes\r\nthat such a request should be noted as a final preambular\r\nparagraph in the draft resolution.\r\nAs the statement by the President of the General\r\nConference, to which our amendment refers, was accepted\r\nby the General Conference by consensus, my delegation\r\nproposes that this amendment also be adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly by consensus, thereby enabling the\r\npreservation of the long-standing tradition of adopting by\r\nconsensus the draft resolution on this important agenda\r\nitem.\r\nIsrael claims that the statement on the workshop\r\nmade by the President of the General Conference was\r\nlinked in one way or another to a statement by the\r\nPresident concerning the composition of the regional\r\ngroups of the IAEA in the context of article VI of the\r\nStatute, which is a totally separate item. For my\r\ndelegation, this is an obvious, flagrant attempt to link two\r\nseparate issues. There was not and will not be any such\r\nlinkage between those two issues, either in the IAEA or\r\nin the General Assembly, because of the simple fact that\r\nEgypt alone does not have the right to decide on Israel’s\r\nacceptance by any IAEA regional group. In a nutshell, the\r\nposition of Israel within any regional group of the IAEA\r\nis a matter between Israel and the members of that\r\nregional group, and cannot, as has been claimed, be\r\npackaged with a sensitive and important issue such as the\r\nfuture of the Middle East as a whole. It can be settled\r\nonly through consultations with member States, as the\r\nstatement of the Conference President on that issue made\r\nclear.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of Israel to\r\nintroduce an amendment to draft resolution A/51/L.9,\r\ncontained in document A/51/L.12.\r\nMr. Yativ (Israel): I am pleased to introduce Israel’s\r\namendment (A/51/L.12) to the draft resolution on the report\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). During\r\nthe IAEA General Conference, held last month, two\r\nstatements were issued by the President of the Conference\r\nand adopted by the Conference. The first statement dealt\r\nwith a workshop on verification to be convened by the\r\nIAEA for Middle East experts and other interested parties.\r\nThe second statement dealt with the composition of regional\r\ngroups in the IAEA in the context of article VI of the\r\nIAEA’s Statute.\r\nBoth statements were negotiated and finally adopted\r\nas a package. Following the tabling of an Egyptian\r\namendment to the draft resolution entitled “Report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”, which deals only\r\nwith the workshop mentioned in one of the statements of\r\nthe President of the Conference, the Israeli delegation has\r\nfound it appropriate to table its own amendment. The Israeli\r\namendment deals with the second statement of the President\r\nof the Conference concerning the composition of regional\r\ngroups of the IAEA. It reads as follows:\r\n“Noting the statement by the President accepted by the\r\nGeneral Conference of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency on 20 September 1996, in the context\r\nof the agenda item “Amendment of article VI of the\r\nStatute” in which, inter alia, the President requests\r\nthat the Chairman of the Board of Governors consult\r\nwith member States and report, for the consideration\r\nof the General Conference, specific proposals to\r\ninclude each member State within the appropriate area\r\nat the time of the Conference in September 1997.”\r\n(A/51/L.12)\r\nIsrael did not wish to amend the draft resolution on\r\nthe IAEA. However, under the circumstances we had to do\r\nso in order to keep the balance. Therefore, we call upon all\r\nMember States to support Israel’s amendment.\r\nMr. Inderfurth (United States of America): On behalf\r\nof the United States, my delegation wishes to express its\r\nfirm support for the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) and its annual report. The IAEA has played a\r\ncrucial role in assuring that nuclear energy is not used for\r\nmilitary purposes and in promoting its peaceful use through\r\ntechnical cooperation and nuclear safety programmes.\r\nIndeed, the Agency holds an important position in\r\nmaintaining international security and assisting in the\r\ndevelopment of humankind. Because of this, the United\r\nStates and the global community have a compelling\r\ninterest in supporting a strong and efficient IAEA. We\r\ncommend the Director General, Mr. Blix, and the IAEA\r\nsecretariat for their continued effective and committed\r\nservice.\r\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has reaffirmed\r\nand strengthened the international community’s\r\ncommitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe foundation of international cooperation under this\r\nagreement rests on the IAEA’s safeguards system, which\r\nbuilds confidence among States that transfers of nuclear\r\ntechnology and information will not be diverted for\r\nmilitary purposes.\r\nIn the light of recent experiences, improvements to\r\nthe IAEA’s ability to detect the diversion of nuclear\r\nmaterial from declared facilities and to provide credible\r\nassurance of the absence of undeclared activities are\r\nnecessary. The goal of reinforcing the non-proliferation\r\nregime under the NPT also depends on reinforcing the\r\nIAEA safeguards system. Bearing this in mind, my\r\nGovernment supports early action in the IAEA to\r\nstrengthen its safeguards mandate.\r\nMy Government commends IAEA efforts to monitor\r\nthe freeze of nuclear activities and to implement\r\nsafeguards in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\n(DPRK). The United States-DPRK Agreed Framework is\r\nimportant to the preservation of stability on the Korean\r\npeninsula. None of the progress being made under the\r\nagreement would have been possible without the\r\ninvolvement of the IAEA. The United States remains\r\ncommitted to the terms of the Agreed Framework, and\r\ncontinues to urge the DPRK to cooperate fully with the\r\nAgency, as set forth in the agreement.\r\nOn the subject of Iraq, We believe that Iraq\r\ndeliberately continues to withhold information from the\r\nIAEA regarding its nuclear weapons programme. We\r\nnote, though, that the language on Iraqi compliance with\r\nrelevant United Nations Security Council resolutions\r\ncontained in operative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution\r\npresented today does not accurately reflect the current\r\nsituation. We must be clear — Iraq continues to withhold\r\ninformation concerning its nuclear programme in violation\r\nof its commitments under United Nations Security\r\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991) and other Security Council\r\nresolutions. The IAEA noted in its most recent semi-\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nannual report to the Security Council that it believes that\r\nIraq still retains a complete record of its nuclear\r\nprogramme.\r\nThe United States commends the continuing efforts of\r\nthe IAEA to determine the scope of Iraq’s clandestine\r\nnuclear weapons programme, which was undertaken in\r\nclear violation of Iraq’s commitments as a party to the\r\nNPT. We support the IAEA’s comprehensive on-site\r\nmonitoring and verification system, which is intended to\r\nthwart the rebuilding of Iraq’s nuclear weapons programme.\r\nI again call upon Iraq to honour fully the commitments\r\nit accepted under United Nations Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991) and other Security Council\r\nresolutions, and to provide immediately all information and\r\nequipment relating to its weapons of mass destruction\r\nprogrammes to the IAEA and the United Nations Special\r\nCommission. There can be no consideration of modifying\r\nthe sanctions regime on Iraq until it complies fully with all\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nMay I turn to two other subjects, namely nuclear\r\nsafety and technical cooperation. We commend the IAEA\r\nsecretariat for expanding significantly its activities in the\r\nfield of nuclear safety. These activities are now housed in\r\na separate department within the secretariat. In addition, we\r\ncommend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in\r\nfostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture\r\nbased on an improved international legal framework,\r\nrecommended safety standards and advisory services. The\r\nAgency should take great satisfaction in its supportive role\r\nin the successful conclusion of the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety which entered into force on 24 October 1996. The\r\nConvention underscores that final responsibility for nuclear\r\nsafety lies with national Governments and establishes the\r\nprinciple that international cooperation is essential for\r\nachieving the highest levels of nuclear power safety\r\nworldwide. The widest possible adherence to this\r\nConvention will enable this achievement to be met.\r\nWe support the IAEA secretariat’s efforts to enhance\r\nits technical cooperation activities through the model project\r\nconcept. By stressing its role as a partner in development\r\nand providing technology based on the socio-economic\r\nneeds of a State, the IAEA is improving its efficiency and\r\neffectiveness in providing tangible benefits in the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy for people around the world. We\r\nurge the secretariat to continue its reforms within the\r\nDepartment of Technical Cooperation aimed at improving\r\nproject formulation, management and implementation.\r\nIn closing, my Government applauds the IAEA’s\r\ncontribution to international peace, security, and welfare.\r\nThe United States pledges its continued strong support for\r\nthe Agency and its excellent work.\r\nMr. Baumanis (Latvia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Campbell (Ireland): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The following\r\nassociated countries align themselves with this statement:\r\nBulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary,\r\nLithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic and\r\nSlovenia. Iceland and Norway have also aligned\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nAllow me to begin by expressing the gratitude of the\r\nmembers of the European Union and those States which\r\nhave aligned themselves with this statement for the\r\nimportant work carried out by the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) during 1995 and the first part of\r\n1996, as described in the annual report for 1995. I should\r\nalso like to thank the Director General, Mr. Hans Blix,\r\nfor the additional information which he has just given.\r\nWe commend the Director General and the secretariat and\r\nstaff of the Agency for their commitment and\r\nprofessionalism in delivering an expanded programme\r\nwithin resource constraints.\r\nThe presentation to the General Assembly of the\r\nannual report of the IAEA provides us with a valuable\r\nopportunity to review the work which the Agency has\r\ncarried out and to measure the impact and efficiency of\r\nits activities in the various fields in which it operates in\r\naccordance with its statutory functions, both in respect of\r\nits work in the prevention of nuclear proliferation and in\r\nthe promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as\r\nwell as in the strengthening of international cooperation\r\nin nuclear safety, radiological protection and waste\r\nmanagement. The European Union wishes to offer a\r\nnumber of comments on some of these activities,\r\nbeginning with the achievements of the international\r\ncommunity in the field of non-proliferation.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the historic decision\r\ntaken by the General Assembly in September to adopt the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which\r\nwe consider to be one of the most significant nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament measures concluded by\r\nthe international community to date. For the European\r\nUnion, this Treaty represents the implementation of\r\ncommitments entered into in article VI of the Treaty on\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and as\r\nmost recently outlined in the Principles and Objectives for\r\nNuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, adopted at the\r\n1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\r\nthat Treaty.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the fact that already in\r\nthe first six weeks since the Treaty was opened for\r\nsignature, 129 Member States have demonstrated the\r\nimportance they attach to this instrument by signing the\r\nTreaty. The European Union calls on all States to ratify the\r\nTreaty at the earliest possible date. The establishment of a\r\nPreparatory Commission for the CTBT organization later\r\nthis year in Vienna will open the way for the necessary\r\npreparatory work to commence to give effect to the Treaty.\r\nWe expect that there will the closest possible cooperation\r\nand the minimum of duplication between the IAEA and the\r\nCTBT Organization in the fields of administrative and\r\nlogistical support in the interest of both efficiency and cost\r\neffectiveness. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban\r\ntreaty is not the end of a process. Further systematic and\r\nprogressive efforts leading to nuclear disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation are called for. The European Union urges\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament, also pursuant to the\r\nPrinciples and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT\r\nReview and Extension Conference, to proceed to\r\nnegotiations on a non-discriminatory, multilateral, and\r\ninternationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the\r\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other\r\nnuclear explosive devices, a so-called cut-off convention.\r\nWe call on the Conference to activate without delay the ad\r\nhoc committee for which the mandate had already been\r\nagreed early in 1995.\r\nLast year the Union welcomed the indefinite extension\r\nof the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the decision on Principles\r\nand Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and\r\nDisarmament and the decision on strengthening the review\r\nprocess of the Treaty. Further progress has since been\r\nachieved on the path to universality of the NPT. We once\r\nmore appeal to the remaining States, and particularly those\r\namong them that operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities,\r\nto accede to the Treaty at the earliest possible date and to\r\nconclude full-scope safeguards agreements with the IAEA.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the safeguards\r\nstatement for 1995 and the secretariat’s notice that it had\r\nnot found any indication that nuclear material which has\r\nbeen placed under safeguards was diverted for any military\r\npurpose or for purposes unknown, or that safeguarded\r\nfacilities, equipment or non-nuclear material were misused.\r\nWe are, however, concerned at the report of the\r\nobstacles which continue to be placed in the Agency’s\r\npath as it attempts to carry out its assigned task of\r\nverifying the correctness and completeness of the initial\r\ndeclaration of nuclear material by the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. Delays in the implementation\r\nof this verification may have a critical effect on the\r\nAgency’s ability to conclude that there has been no\r\ndiversion of nuclear material in the DPRK. We urge the\r\nDPRK to comply with its safeguards commitments.\r\nIn respect of Iraq, we note the conclusion of the\r\nsafeguards implementation report that, as of\r\n31 December 1995, there was no indication of a need to\r\nchange the Agency’s assessment that Iraq’s practical\r\ncapability to manufacture nuclear weapons had been\r\ndestroyed, removed or rendered harmless. In the light of\r\nIraq’s failure in the past to comply with Security Council\r\nresolutions, the European Union urges the secretariat to\r\ncontinue to exercise vigilance in this matter. In this\r\ncontext, while noting the more constructive approach\r\nadopted over the past 12 months by Iraq towards the\r\nAgency, the European Union expresses concern at Iraq’s\r\nfailure on 7 July 1996 to provide immediate access to the\r\nAgency’s action team and its previous withholding from\r\nthe Agency of information about its nuclear weapons\r\nprogramme in violation of its obligations under relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, and, in this context, stresses\r\nthe need for Iraq to cooperate fully with the Agency to\r\nresolve the remaining inconsistency concerning the full,\r\nfinal and complete declaration in achieving the\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nWhile such matters continue to give us cause for\r\nconcern in the context of non-proliferation goals, other\r\npositive developments have occurred in the past year,\r\nnotably in respect of nuclear-weapon-free zones. The\r\nEuropean Union considers such zones based on\r\narrangements freely arrived at among the States of the\r\nregion concerned as important complementary instruments\r\nto the NPT.\r\nThe European Union therefore welcomes the\r\nsignature on 11 April 1996 of the Treaty of Pelindaba,\r\nestablishing an African nuclear-weapon-free zone; and the\r\nsigning of the relevant Protocols to the Treaty of\r\nRarotonga, on 25 March 1996, by France, the United\r\nKingdom and the United States. The European Union\r\nwelcomes the efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone in South-East Asia. The Union supports this project\r\nand urges the countries of the Association of South-East\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to pursue their objective in a way\r\nthat recognizes general principles of international law. The\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the steady consolidation of the\r\nregime established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the first\r\nTreaty to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in a large\r\ninhabited region of the world.\r\nIn the Middle East, the European Union continues to\r\nsupport efforts for the early establishment by the States in\r\nthe region of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other\r\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. We\r\ncall upon all States directly concerned to overcome existing\r\ndifficulties and to take the requisite steps for the\r\nimplementation of a mutually and effectively verifiable\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.\r\nAccession by regional States, particularly in South\r\nAsia and the Middle East, to the NPT, which remains the\r\ncornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime,\r\nwould contribute to confidence that nuclear programmes in\r\nthese regions were exclusively for peaceful purposes.\r\nThe European Union confirms once again its strong\r\nsupport for strengthening the effectiveness and improving\r\nthe efficiency of the safeguards system and its full\r\ncommitment to Programme 93+2. The experience of recent\r\nyears has demonstrated the need for a vigorous approach to\r\nverification. The increased risk of detection is itself a major\r\ndeterrent to potential proliferators.\r\nIn our view, the adoption of adequate new measures\r\nwill significantly increase the IAEA’s capability to build as\r\ncomplete a picture as possible of a State’s nuclear activities\r\nand thereby increase the capability of the Agency to detect\r\nundeclared nuclear activities, in accordance with the\r\nDecision on “Principles and objectives for nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament” adopted by the 1995 NPT\r\nReview and Extension Conference.\r\nWe are already working with the Agency on the\r\nimplementation of part I measures, while in respect of part\r\nII we will continue to participate actively in the committee\r\nassigned to draft a model protocol at the earliest possible\r\ndate. We will continue to make every effort to bring the\r\nwork of the Committee to a successful conclusion at the\r\nearliest possible date.\r\nNuclear export control measures are useful instruments\r\nfor preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. It must be clearly understood that the right\r\nenshrined in article IV of the NPT to develop research,\r\nproduction and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes\r\nis to be exercised in conformity with the non-proliferation\r\nobligations set out in articles I and II of the Treaty. Thus,\r\nfar from being an obstacle to the promotion of the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, nuclear-related export\r\ncontrols are the necessary corollary of peaceful nuclear\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe European Union, which has endorsed the\r\nguidelines in matters of nuclear exports published by the\r\nAgency in the INFCIRC/254 series, calls on all exporting\r\ncountries which have not yet done so to accept these\r\nguidelines and to establish an effective national\r\nmechanism for export control. The principles and\r\nobjectives adopted at the NPT Review and Extension\r\nConference in 1995 state that nuclear-related export\r\ncontrols should be promoted within the framework of\r\ndialogue and cooperation among all interested States\r\nparties. The European Union has been actively following\r\nup this issue with others.\r\nIn relation to illicit trafficking, the European Union\r\nwelcomes the programme for preventing and combating\r\nillicit trafficking in nuclear material agreed upon by the\r\nparticipants in the Moscow Summit on Nuclear Safety\r\nand Security of April 1996. We call on all Governments\r\nto implement this programme, and we hope that it will\r\nlead to increased cooperation among Governments in all\r\naspects of prevention, detection, exchange of information,\r\ninvestigation and prosecution in cases of illicit trafficking.\r\nPhysical protection of nuclear material is one of the\r\nkey elements in the fight against illicit trafficking. The\r\nEuropean Union reiterates its call to all States that have\r\nnot yet done so to place all their nuclear material under\r\nan effective protection system, in accordance with\r\ninternational guidelines. The European Union further calls\r\non all States that have not yet done so to become parties\r\nto the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterial.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the work done by the\r\nparties concerned on guidelines for the management of\r\ncivil plutonium, which would constitute an important\r\ncomplement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration\r\non the safe and effective management of weapons fissile\r\nmaterial designated as no longer required for defence\r\npurposes, inter alia, through the Nuclear Suppliers Group\r\ncontrols on the traffic in nuclear materials, which would\r\nbe safely stored, protected and placed under IAEA\r\nsafeguards.\r\nTechnical cooperation is the area of Agency activity\r\nof most direct relevance to many members of the IAEA.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nThe scale of the European Union’s contribution across the\r\nrange of Agency cooperation activities reflects the\r\nimportance which we believe targeted assistance can have\r\nin economic and social development in those countries.\r\nFully one third of Technical Cooperation Fund resources in\r\n1995 came from the European Union.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the tragic accident at\r\nChernobyl provided an opportune moment for the IAEA,\r\nthe European Commission and the World Health\r\nOrganization to organize a conference to review the\r\nconsequences of the accident and the lessons that have been\r\nlearned. Its conclusions, as well as other relevant\r\ninformation, will serve as a factual basis for decisions about\r\nfuture work and collaboration.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the decision of the\r\nMoscow Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security to provide\r\ninternational assistance to Ukraine. The Union is committed\r\nto providing financial aid to assist Ukraine in improving\r\nnuclear safety and security. We look forward to Ukraine’s\r\nfulfilment of its commitment to close the old Chernobyl\r\ninstallations by the year 2000 at the latest. The Moscow\r\nSummit highlighted progress to date and it reinforced the\r\nimportance of international partnership in addressing\r\nnuclear safety concerns.\r\nThe European Union has taken a leading role in the\r\nstrengthening of regulatory regimes, including in the\r\nestablishment of the nuclear safety account, administered by\r\nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,\r\nthe G 24 coordinating mechanism, the European Union’s\r\nPoland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy\r\n(PHARE) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States (TACIS) programmes, the European\r\nAtomic Energy Community loan facility, coordinated\r\nsupport from the international financial institutions for the\r\nenergy sector, and bilateral cooperation projects.\r\nWhile recognizing that primary responsibility for\r\nnuclear safety rests with national Governments, the\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the\r\nIAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and\r\nits continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety\r\nculture, and recognizes its contribution to future work under\r\nthe Convention on Nuclear Safety, which is a major\r\naccomplishment in this field.\r\nWe congratulate the IAEA on its preparedness to\r\nundertake work on limiting the effects of a nuclear\r\naccident, should one occur.\r\nRadioactive waste management issues are\r\nincreasingly important to the public perception of nuclear\r\nsafety and have become a matter for closer international\r\ncooperation. In this connection, the elaboration of a draft\r\nconvention is well under way and we look forward to the\r\nconclusion of a convention in 1997 that will oblige\r\ncountries to manage their waste properly so as to avoid\r\nunacceptable risks now or in the future to both the public\r\nand the environment.\r\nOn the prospects for ensuring an effective nuclear\r\nliability regime providing adequate and equitable\r\ncompensation to victims in the event of a nuclear\r\naccident, we welcome the progress made in discussions\r\non the revision of the 1960 Vienna Convention on Civil\r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage. In particular, we wish to\r\nsee further efforts at concluding the provisions on\r\nguarantees. We remain concerned that vital safety\r\nimprovements remain to be undertaken in certain States.\r\nAt a time of financial stringency in both national\r\nadministrations and international organizations, we\r\nacknowledge the valuable assistance provided by\r\nextrabudgetary contributions from certain Governments.\r\nHowever, prompt payment of assessed contributions by\r\nall member States of the Agency would immediately\r\nimprove the Agency’s financial situation and permit a\r\ngreater degree of stability and forward planning in its\r\nactivities. We urge all members to forward promptly and\r\nin full their assessed contributions to the regular budget.\r\nThe European Union wishes to acknowledge the\r\nefforts of the Director General and his staff, who have\r\nshown dedication and commitment in concentrating on\r\npriority activities and by applying rigorous standards\r\nthroughout the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, the European Union supports the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/51/L.9 which has just\r\nbeen introduced by the representative of Canada and\r\nexpresses the wish that the General Assembly will adopt\r\nit.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nMr. Syargeeu (Belarus)(interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus has carefully\r\nstudied the report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) for the period under review and notes with\r\nsatisfaction the highly professional level of its preparation.\r\nWe are grateful to the Director General of the Agency, Mr.\r\nHans Blix, for having presented the report to the General\r\nAssembly. In the 40 years that have elapsed since the\r\nadoption of the IAEA Statute, the Agency has contributed\r\nsubstantially to the development and implementation of\r\ninternational machinery to strengthen security and to\r\nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\r\nBelarus, as a State that strictly adheres to the\r\nprinciples of non-proliferation, attaches special significance\r\nto that area of the Agency’s activities. Now that it is\r\nindependent, Belarus is taking meaningful steps to achieve\r\nnon-nuclear status. It has ratified the START Treaty,\r\nacceded as a non-nuclear State to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and signed a\r\nsafeguards agreement with the IAEA. The opening for\r\nsignature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is\r\nanother major landmark. The Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Belarus signed that Treaty on 24 September 1996, the\r\nvery first day it was open for signature.\r\nBelarus values the efforts of the IAEA to promote the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. With the\r\nsignature of the Treaty of Pelindaba, the entire southern\r\nhemisphere has become a single nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nIn our view, this should lead to similar steps by the\r\ncountries of the northern hemisphere.\r\nAn important contribution to the process of nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation is being made by Belarus, Kazakstan and\r\nUkraine, on whose territories 3,400 nuclear missiles were\r\ndeployed until recently. The last strategic nuclear missiles\r\nwill leave the territory of Belarus before the end of this\r\nyear, thus freeing the entire area of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope of nuclear weapons.\r\nIn this connection, the initiative by Belarus to establish\r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe is important and\r\ntimely. The implementation of that initiative would assist\r\nthe process of nuclear disarmament, help to prevent the\r\nrenewal of nuclear confrontation in Europe, consolidate the\r\nexisting non-nuclear obligations of States in the region,\r\nforestall the possibility of the further geographical spread of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, and enhance confidence\r\namong States.\r\nThe term “zone” is designed to give flexibility to\r\nthis idea and attract potential participants and interested\r\nStates to discuss it. We believe that such a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone could be based on a harmonious\r\ncombination of the legal and political, multilateral and\r\nunilateral obligations of States. Both our nearest\r\nneighbours, linking their security to membership in the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which have\r\na special position with regard to the nuclear arms of the\r\nalliance, and neutral countries could be participants in this\r\nendeavour. Members of NATO, which have a special\r\nposition with regard to the nuclear arms of the alliance,\r\ncould also join the zone to one degree or another.\r\nThis idea should not be regarded simply as a\r\ncountermeasure to the plans to extend NATO. It is not\r\ndesigned to block such plans but rather to help find\r\nsolutions towards the establishment of pan-European\r\nsecurity and strengthening of international security in\r\ngeneral. It takes into account the interests of all European\r\nStates and security structures. Belarus intends to move\r\ngradually towards that goal, bearing in mind the strategic\r\ninterests of the countries involved and guided by the\r\ndesire to avoid damaging security and stability on the\r\nEuropean continent.\r\nWe support IAEA efforts to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the safeguards system, and we intend to\r\ncomply strictly with the obligations we have entered into\r\nin this area. With the direct participation of the United\r\nStates, Sweden and Japan, as well as with Agency\r\ncoordination, Belarus has taken the first steps towards\r\nestablishing a State system of verification and control of\r\nnuclear materials. In this connection, we express our\r\ngratitude to the Governments of those countries for their\r\nassistance.\r\nBelarus welcomes the steps taken by the IAEA to\r\nstrengthen the existing safeguards system under its\r\nProgramme 93+2. We are sure that in the future the\r\nIAEA will play a key role in strengthening the non-\r\nproliferation regime.\r\nBelarus also notes the significant work done by the\r\nAgency in the sphere of international law and standards.\r\nWe refer in particular to the adoption of the Convention\r\non Nuclear Safety and the work under way on the revised\r\nConvention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and a\r\nconvention on radioactive waste management. In this\r\nregard, we would point out that Belarus has already begun\r\nthe procedure to accede to the Vienna Convention on\r\nCivil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Joint Protocol.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nIllicit trafficking in nuclear material can be a serious\r\nthreat to the security of States. In this connection, the\r\nprogramme of action in this area agreed on at the Moscow\r\nNuclear Safety and Security Summit is particularly timely.\r\nWe also note the proposals made by the Russian Federation\r\nfor a convention to combat acts of nuclear terrorism, which\r\nis now being discussed in the Sixth Committee.\r\nThis year, the world community commemorated with\r\nsorrow the tenth anniversary of the accident at the\r\nChernobyl nuclear power plant. That accident not only had\r\na negative impact on the development of nuclear energy, as\r\nmentioned by Mr. Blix, it also affected the health of\r\nmillions of people. Today, nearly two million people live in\r\nthe contaminated area of Belarus, including approximately\r\n500,000 children. According to the most modest estimates,\r\nthe economic and material damage done to Belarus by that\r\naccident is equivalent to 32 of the Republic’s annual\r\nbudgets, or US$ 235 billion.\r\nBelarus is profoundly grateful to the European\r\nCommunity, the IAEA, the World Health Organization\r\n(WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) and others for\r\ntheir contribution to the convening of international meetings\r\ndevoted to the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster\r\nand which were held at Geneva, Minsk, Vienna and Kiev.\r\nThe participants in the Minsk meeting concluded that\r\nthe significant increase in thyroid cancer among children\r\nand young persons in the affected countries — of whom\r\nthere are more than 1,000 altogether — was caused by the\r\nradioactive effect of the Chernobyl disaster. At the present\r\ntime, new kinds of oncological illnesses are appearing. The\r\ninternational meetings reaffirmed the large scale of the\r\nChernobyl tragedy and the long-term nature of its\r\nconsequences as well as the need to increase international\r\ncooperation in assisting the populations affected, the\r\nimportance of continued scientific research in this area, and\r\nthe need to move on from research to concrete projects.\r\nThe delegation of Belarus is certain that the United\r\nNations and the IAEA will utilize the results of those\r\nmeetings in their practical activities, as was mentioned by\r\nthe representative of the European Union. Belarus is\r\ngrateful to the United Nations for the work it has done to\r\nfind a solution to the Chernobyl problem. We are also\r\nseriously concerned at the fact that against the background\r\nof discussions now under way on the closing of the\r\nChernobyl installation less attention is now being paid to\r\nthe problem of eliminating the medical and ecological\r\nconsequences of the disaster. In this connection, we\r\nwould draw the attention of delegations to two important\r\ninitiatives put forward by Belarus at the Vienna\r\nconference on Chernobyl, namely, the establishment of a\r\nsingle international centre to deal with Chernobyl-\r\nconnected problems, which would unite the efforts being\r\nmade by scientists from various countries who are doing\r\nresearch in this area, and the need to set up a fund to\r\nprotect our planet, which might receive a percentage of\r\nthe income of nuclear engineering and energy companies,\r\nusing the funds to eliminate the consequences of nuclear\r\ndisasters and carry out important ecological programmes.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations and the IAEA will show\r\nunderstanding and support for these ideas.\r\nBelarus is convinced that we will soon arrive at and\r\nagree on a United Nations strategy on further expansion\r\nof international cooperation with regard to Chernobyl in\r\nthe second post-disaster decade, with the active\r\nparticipation of the IAEA.\r\nOne of the most important areas of activity of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is technical\r\ncooperation. We note the practical significance of the\r\nrecommendations of the third seminar on policies for\r\ntechnical cooperation, and in particular the positive role\r\nthat the IAEA is playing as coordinator in strengthening\r\nthe infrastructure for ensuring radiation and nuclear safety\r\nin the new, independent States. We support the recent\r\ninitiative taken by the Agency to render additional\r\ntechnical support as part of the programme of regional\r\ncooperation for 1997-1998. The Agency should in future\r\ncontinue to show a flexible approach to the organization\r\nof technical cooperation to those countries, bearing in\r\nmind their national interests.\r\nIn this connection, the Government of Belarus is\r\ncounting on the support of the IAEA, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) and interested States in\r\nthe Polessky State Radiation and Ecological Preserve,\r\nwhich deals with scientific research on the impact of\r\nionization on the environment. Highly qualified specialists\r\nat this facility are preparing a number of concrete\r\nscientific projects whose realization will need\r\ninternational financial support. In this connection, we\r\nwould like to request that support be given to these\r\nprojects, which are of scientific and practical value for the\r\nentire international community.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Belarus wishes to\r\nexpress its appreciation for the work done by the Agency\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nin 1995 and supports the priority areas for its future\r\nactivities. We also hope that there will be close\r\ncooperation with the Agency in solving all problems\r\npertaining to the peaceful use of atomic energy.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nKuwait bases its support for the work of the IAEA on the\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy on its belief in the\r\nimportance of the role and responsibility of the Agency.\r\nThe Agency will not be able to succeed in its endeavours\r\nwithout the cooperation and support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nKuwait and the other countries that aspire to peace,\r\nsecurity, and stability will never relinquish their dream of\r\nfreeing this beautiful planet from all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction — nuclear, chemical and biological. This hope\r\nhas emerged as a result of Kuwait’s realization of the\r\nterrible danger posed by these lethal weapons, which\r\nthreaten present and future generations and jeopardize the\r\nstability to which we all aspire. That dream will not be\r\nrealized unless we use nuclear energy in a rational way.\r\nKuwait associates itself with those who call for using\r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic\r\ndevelopment, particularly in view of the tremendous\r\ntechnological developments we have witnessed in the use\r\nof this energy. We wish to express our satisfaction at the\r\nreport of the IAEA on the progress made in evaluating the\r\ntechnical and economic feasibility of using nuclear power\r\nto desalinate the sea and to generate electricity, while\r\nensuring nuclear safety through a safeguards system.\r\nThe peaceful use of nuclear energy will dispel the\r\nanxiety and apprehension we feel as a result of the negative\r\nconsequences of the abuse of this energy, and allay our\r\nfears concerning radioactive emissions and their resulting\r\nrisks to health and to the international environment as a\r\nwhole.\r\nThe Government of Kuwait is following with interest\r\nthe international efforts to prohibit the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons, and it expresses its satisfaction at the fact\r\nthat the Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) resulted in the\r\nTreaty’s indefinite extension. We also welcome the\r\nadoption by the General Assembly last September of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), in the\r\nhope that this will be a prelude to complete and\r\ncomprehensive nuclear disarmament.\r\nKuwait is pleased to have been one of the first\r\ncountries to sign the CTBT on 24 September 1996. We\r\nhope that circumstances will be conducive to its speedy\r\nentry into force.\r\nKuwait also attaches great importance to the\r\nactivities of the Agency in guaranteeing the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons or their use for military\r\npurposes. We believe that one of the Agency’s most\r\nimportant activities is the strict application of the\r\nsafeguards system, which aims to prevent the diversion of\r\nnuclear energy for military use. We support enhancing the\r\nsystem and closing its loopholes, which, regrettably, have\r\nrevealed that the system is very easy to breach, as\r\nindicated in the report of the Agency.\r\nThe process of limiting nuclear armaments requires,\r\nas I indicated at the beginning of my statement, concerted\r\ninternational efforts in order to seriously and in a practical\r\nmanner work towards that objective.\r\nThe creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nSouth-East Asia and the signing of the Pelindaba Treaty\r\non a nuclear-weapon free zone in Africa are but two\r\nexamples of the practical application of the principle of\r\nlimiting nuclear armaments and of the non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nWe hope to see the day when the Middle East region\r\nwill also be free from nuclear weapons. However, Israel’s\r\nrefusal to accede to the NPT and to subject its nuclear\r\ninstallations to the safeguards of the Agency constitutes\r\na major obstacle to the realization of this objective.\r\nWe salute the efforts made by the Director General\r\nof the Agency to realize this endeavour. We call upon\r\nhim to continue his consultations with the Middle East\r\ncountries to facilitate an early application of the full scope\r\nof the safeguards on all nuclear activities, so that the\r\nMiddle East region can be free from all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including non-nuclear weapons.\r\nWe reaffirm our full support for the efforts of the\r\nAgency and for those of the teams of inspectors. We call\r\non them to continue their constant verification and\r\nmonitoring activities in Iraq. We also hope that, with the\r\neffective participation of the Agency and the Member\r\nStates, the export-import mechanism approved by the\r\nSecurity Council in its resolution 1051 (1996), which\r\nprohibits Iraq from acquiring any items for the\r\ndevelopment of its nuclear capability for non-peaceful\r\npurposes, will be implemented.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nKuwait also attaches great importance to the efforts\r\nmade by the Special Commission in charge of ridding the\r\narea of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and the efforts\r\nmade by international inspectors to ensure that Iraq does\r\nnot acquire such weapons. Kuwait would therefore like to\r\nexpress its complete support of the efforts made by the\r\nSpecial Commission, led by Ambassador Ekeus.\r\nWhen Kuwait speaks fear of the spread of nuclear\r\nweapons, we are speaking from ongoing experience. Thus,\r\nKuwait calls on the international community to make a\r\nconcerted effort to use nuclear energy to create a world that\r\nenjoys peace not anxiety, development not wars or\r\ndestruction. We believe in the relationship of peace and\r\nstability with development, and we believe that this energy\r\nthat we are endowed with should be used for the prosperity\r\nof all the peoples of the world.\r\nMr. Kovanda (Czech Republic): At the outset, I wish\r\nto recall that my delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatement presented earlier by Ireland on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. I shall therefore now address only those\r\nissues which the Czech Republic considers of particular\r\nimportance.\r\nFor the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\r\n1997 will be a year of profound evaluation of what has\r\nbeen achieved and what might have been done even better\r\nin the course of its 40 years of existence. In our view,\r\npositive results predominate both in the area of safeguards\r\nand in that of promotional activities. Let me review some\r\nof the major events which have taken place since the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. The international\r\nnuclear-energy community, and ultimately non-nuclear\r\nStates as well, have been marked by a cornerstone event,\r\nthe recent entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety. Concluding the Convention and opening it for\r\nsignature at the thirty-eighth session of the IAEA General\r\nConference in 1994 were two major steps towards reaching\r\nthe highest possible safety of nuclear power plants all over\r\nthe world. The Czech Republic calls upon all Member\r\nStates which have not yet done so to sign and ratify the\r\nConvention. Only the widest possible adherence to it will\r\nallow us to obtain the objectives of the Convention.\r\nNuclear safety includes safety of radioactive waste\r\nmanagement. Czech experts participate in the work of the\r\nopen-ended group preparing the text of a draft convention\r\nwhich will deal with this very sensitive issue. Concluding\r\na convention on safety of radioactive waste management is\r\na priority for us, and we believe that the discussions in the\r\ngroup will lead to a compromise text that could be\r\nsubmitted to a diplomatic conference in the near future.\r\nThe Czech Republic also views with satisfaction\r\ndevelopments in the area of thwarting illicit trafficking in\r\nnuclear material and other radiation resources. We\r\nwelcome the establishment of the IAEA database of\r\nincidents in this field. It is a very useful source of\r\ninformation which assists Member States in identifying\r\nsuppliers and potential recipients and in combating illegal\r\ncross-border transfers.\r\nWe are pleased that in the process of revising the\r\nVienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage\r\nexperts have managed to narrow their differences and\r\nhave made remarkable progress towards finalizing its\r\nupdate. We would like to witness similar progress in\r\nnegotiations concerning a convention on supplementary\r\nfunding in the near future.\r\nThe Czech Republic has always attached very high\r\nimportance to the role of the IAEA in safeguarding\r\nnuclear facilities worldwide in accordance with its\r\nmandate under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). However, we too have realized\r\nthat the present system of safeguards does not enable the\r\nAgency to detect possible clandestine and undeclared\r\nnuclear activities. It needs to be modified and\r\nstrengthened. We confirm once again our commitment to\r\nthe work of the drafting committee on the protocol\r\nsupplementary to the safeguards agreements. The Czech\r\nRepublic will do what it can to contribute to the earliest\r\npossible finalization of the text, which should become an\r\ninstrument for the more effective and efficient\r\nimplementation of safeguards.\r\nThe statute of the IAEA gives it a mandate to\r\npromote the use of nuclear energy in all human activities\r\nfor exclusively peaceful purposes. The Czech Republic\r\nfully recognizes the importance for many States of IAEA\r\ntechnical assistance and cooperation programmes and\r\ncommends the Agency for its efforts. We have never been\r\na recipient country of this type of technical assistance, yet\r\nwe have always both fulfilled our pledges to the\r\nVoluntary Fund for technical cooperation and paid our\r\ncontributions to the regular budget in full and in time.\r\nThis is the right way to deal with the financial difficulties\r\nof the IAEA and to enable the Agency to carry out all its\r\ntasks. When considering technical cooperation and\r\nassistance for Member States for the next period, the\r\nIAEA should take into account their financial discipline\r\nas well.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nDespite all its efforts, the IAEA remains unable to\r\nverify the initial declaration of nuclear material made by\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; that country is\r\nstill not in full compliance with its safeguards agreement.\r\nAlthough some progress has been made, the Czech\r\nRepublic continues to appeal to the DPRK to provide the\r\nAgency with all the information necessary to verify the\r\ncorrectness and completeness of the declaration, to allow\r\naccess by inspectors to all installations which are to be\r\nsubject to safeguards and to assist the IAEA in its\r\ndeliberations.\r\nWe also regret the circumstances in Iraq which have\r\nmade it difficult for IAEA inspectors to continue their\r\nmonitoring and verification activities outside Baghdad. The\r\nCzech Republic fully supports the Agency in its continuous\r\nefforts to investigate all aspects of Iraq’s past nuclear\r\nweapons programme and to analyse the documentation\r\ngained, and it calls upon Iraq to cooperate with the Agency\r\nin resolving remaining inconsistencies.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express once again my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation and support for the work of the\r\nAgency. My delegation recommends the adoption of the\r\ndraft resolution concerning the IAEA.\r\nMr. Abdellah (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like to thank the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) for the report submitted to the General\r\nAssembly on its activities for 1995, as contained in\r\ndocument A/51/307. We also wish to thank the Director\r\nGeneral of the Agency, Mr. Hans Blix, for his statement\r\nthis morning and for the additional information it provided\r\non the work of the Agency during the past year.\r\nThe annual review by the General Assembly of the\r\nreport of the IAEA reflects the ongoing interest of Member\r\nStates in the role played by the Agency and in its activities,\r\nwhich involve both strengthening the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime and providing technical\r\ncooperation and assistance to countries, particularly\r\ndeveloping ones, in connection with the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy.\r\nThis post-cold-war period has been characterized by\r\nthe adoption of significant measures in the field of\r\ndisarmament, including the recent adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which my country\r\nsupported and signed. The Agency, as an instrument for\r\nnuclear non-proliferation, thus has a vital role to play in\r\nstrengthening these measures, and others that remain to be\r\nadopted, in order to rid the world of its arsenals of terror,\r\nparticularly those of nuclear weapons.\r\nLikewise, we support the programme to strengthen\r\nthe Agency’s efficiency and to improve the effectiveness\r\nof its safeguards system — a programme that is\r\ncommonly known as 93 + 2. However desirable this may\r\nbe, we believe that the implementation of this programme\r\nshould take into account certain basic principles, in\r\nparticular the need for balance between States’ new\r\ncommitments and their fundamental sovereignty. It is also\r\nnecessary to ensure that this programme does not entail\r\nadditional costs, which would lead to an excessive\r\nincrease in the contributions of States. In this connection,\r\nwe believe that the nuclear-weapon States should assume\r\nthe bulk of the costs of the implementation of the\r\nproposed new measures. Lastly, the application of the 93\r\n+ 2 programme should be consistent with the principle of\r\nuniversality.\r\nThe goal of achieving universality for the IAEA\r\nsafeguards system should be the subject of constant and\r\nresolute efforts by the entire international community, the\r\nIAEA included. In the Middle East, Israel’s nuclear\r\ncapability still remains outside international control,\r\npresenting a constant threat to the security of other States\r\nand preventing the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone in the region. We would like here to reiterate our\r\nappeal to Israel, the only State in the region that has not\r\nacceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons, to adhere to it and to place its nuclear\r\ninstallations under the IAEA comprehensive safeguards\r\nsystem. This would allow the creation of a denuclearized\r\nzone in the Middle East and would, in turn, strengthen the\r\nconfidence of the States of the region in one another.\r\nSuch confidence is required for the achievement of lasting\r\npeace. The zone would be complementary to the African\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone, since peace and security on the\r\nAfrican continent and in the Middle East are\r\ninterdependent and closely connected.\r\nAnother, no less important aspect of the work of the\r\nAgency concerns technical assistance and cooperation in\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy for the benefit of the\r\ndeveloping countries. Given its importance to the\r\neconomic and social development of these countries, the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear technology should be encouraged\r\nand strengthened. In addition, the relevant technology\r\nshould be transferred in order to hasten the development\r\nof the countries of the South and by the foundation for\r\nsustainable development throughout the world. Such\r\ndevelopment is synonymous with security in the broadest\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nsense of the term. Among the many civilian areas in which\r\nnuclear energy can be used are those involving\r\nhydrogeology, the desalination of sea water and studies on\r\nthe use of small and medium-sized reactors, which can be\r\nadapted to the needs of developing countries, including\r\nTunisia.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has a crucial\r\nrole to play in promoting the peaceful use of nuclear\r\nenergy. We welcome the measures and decisions the\r\nAgency has adopted to strengthen its activities in this field.\r\nWe emphasize the need to ensure adequate financing for\r\nthe Agency’s programmes in the field of technical\r\ncooperation, and believe that the Standing Advisory Group\r\non Technical Assistance and Cooperation established within\r\nthe Agency should seek ways of further strengthening this\r\ncooperation.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of improving representation by the various\r\nregions of the world within the Agency’s organs. The\r\nregions of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia remain\r\nunder-represented on the IAEA’s Board of Governors. The\r\ntime has come to enlarge the Board in order to include\r\nother States from these regions, so as to enhance the\r\nrepresentativeness of the Agency and strengthen its\r\ncredibility and its universality.\r\nMr. Baltov (Bulgaria): My delegation shares the\r\nviews set forward earlier in the statement of the\r\nrepresentative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union\r\nand associated countries. Let me also commend the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the\r\nsecretariat of the Agency for the work done, as reflected in\r\nthe annual report for 1995 and in the comprehensive\r\nintroductory statement of Mr. Hans Blix. We hope that the\r\nannual draft resolution that has been submitted affirming\r\nconfidence in the role of the IAEA will be particularly\r\nhelpful for the Agency to accomplish the important tasks\r\nahead, in conformity with its statutory functions.\r\nThe conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) is undoubtedly an achievement of truly\r\nhistoric proportions. Bulgaria took a constructive role,\r\nwithin the Conference on Disarmament, in the CTBT\r\nnegotiation process. In conformity with its long-standing\r\npolicies in favour of nuclear arms control and disarmament,\r\nBulgaria signed the Treaty on the very first day it was\r\nopened for signature here in New York. We believe that the\r\nCTBT will strengthen nuclear non-proliferation and will\r\ncontribute to nuclear disarmament. We join the call for all\r\nStates to become parties to the CTBT so that the Treaty\r\nmay enter into force at the earliest possible date, thus\r\nbanning all nuclear test explosions in all environments\r\nforever.\r\nWe believe that the location in Vienna of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\r\n(CTBTO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) will facilitate maximum cooperation and\r\nminimum duplication in their work.\r\nAnother important step on the security ladder is the\r\nspeedy conclusion of the so-called cut-off convention by\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament. We urge the Conference\r\non Disarmament to activate its Ad Hoc Committee,\r\nmandated last year to negotiate a non-discriminatory,\r\nmultilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning\r\nthe production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or\r\nother nuclear explosive devices. Bulgaria supports an\r\nearly start of negotiations on this issue.\r\nAs reflected in the introductory statement on the\r\nactivities of the IAEA, 1996 features a number of\r\nimportant international agreements. First of all, the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety, fostering a global nuclear-\r\nsafety culture, entered into force on 24 October and, as a\r\nState already party to the Convention, Bulgaria looks\r\nforward to its early implementation. On another track, the\r\npreparation of the convention on safety of radioactive\r\nwaste management is advancing well. The work on the\r\nrevision of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for\r\nNuclear Damage seems to have reached a stage\r\nforecasting its completion in the not-so-distant future.\r\nGiven the importance of the broadest possible\r\nparticipation in the future revised Vienna Convention, we\r\nfavour the so-called phasing-in approach with regard to\r\noperators’ civil liabilities as a major incentive to meet this\r\nobjective. We also consider that the revision process\r\nshould not be decoupled from the elaboration of the\r\ncomplementary funding system.\r\nBulgaria welcomes the important contribution of the\r\nIAEA and States Members to nuclear non-proliferation\r\nthrough the implementation of part 1 and through the\r\nspeeding up of endeavours to finalize a model protocol\r\nfor implementation of part 2 measures of Programme\r\n“93 + 2”. We regard these measures as pertinent to\r\nassuring the non-existence of undeclared nuclear\r\nactivities. They will enhance the capability of the Agency\r\nin conformity with the decision on principles and\r\nobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nadopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension\r\nConference.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nNational export-control measures in the nuclear field\r\nare instrumental for preventing the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. As a member of the Zangger Committee and the\r\nNuclear Suppliers Group, Bulgaria supports the view that\r\nthe right enshrined in article IV of the NPT to develop\r\nresearch, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes is to be exercised in conformity with the\r\nnon-proliferation obligations set out in articles I and II of\r\nthe Treaty.\r\nProper handling of the problems related to illicit\r\ntrafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive\r\nsources also remains high on the international community’s\r\nagenda. Recognizing that the primary responsibility in this\r\nfield is at the national level, we welcome the growing\r\nimportance of international cooperation between the States\r\nMembers and the role of the IAEA in facilitating it. The\r\nprogramme for preventing and combating illicit trafficking\r\nin nuclear material adopted by the participants at the\r\nMoscow Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security of April\r\n1996 is expected to enhance cooperation among\r\nGovernments in all relevant fields, thus deterring illicit\r\ntrafficking. We are also pleased to note that the\r\nconsolidated database established by the Agency in this area\r\nis already operational.\r\nThe IAEA’s 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates\r\nthat the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy and in fostering global peace and security as\r\nprovided for in its statute and relevant international\r\ninstruments. We also welcome the encouraging 1995\r\nsafeguards statement of the Agency. Bulgaria reiterates its\r\nresolve to further fulfil its obligations in this field.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that, as regards technical\r\ncooperation, the overall increase in programme delivery in\r\n1995 resulted in the high implementation rate of 75.7 per\r\ncent. We would like to commend in particular the increase\r\nin model projects, fellowships, scientific visits and\r\nparticipation in training courses. These networking activities\r\nbroaden the principal objective of technical cooperation to\r\nenhance social and economic goals.\r\nThe IAEA’s activities with regard to nuclear power\r\nand the fuel cycle, as well as nuclear and radiation safety,\r\nare of great importance for the development of nuclear\r\npower and for the safe operation of nuclear facilities. As a\r\ncountry operating WWER-type power reactors, we are\r\nparticularly interested in the work of the Agency in this\r\nfield. We are grateful for the Agency’s practical assistance\r\nin improving the safety of our Kozloduy nuclear-power\r\nplant units and in strengthening the Bulgarian Nuclear\r\nSafety Authority.\r\nThe Bulgarian Government and our national Nuclear\r\nSafety Authority have demonstrated a responsible\r\napproach to nuclear safety by taking all necessary\r\nmeasures for the safe operation of the Kozloduy nuclear\r\npower plant. A programme for the reconstruction, safety\r\nupgrading and backfitting of Kozloduy nuclear power\r\nplant units 1 to 4 has been developed and is now being\r\nimplemented in cooperation with the IAEA, the European\r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),\r\nWestinghouse, Siemens, and the Kurchatov Institute.\r\nNuclear power is playing and will continue to play\r\nan important role in satisfying national energy demands.\r\nIn 1995 46.4 per cent of Bulgaria’s total electricity\r\nproduction was of nuclear origin.\r\nThe Republic of Bulgaria’s Strategy for Energy\r\nDevelopment during the period 1995-2010 and beyond,\r\nuntil the year 2020, has also been approved by the\r\nCouncil of Ministers and the relevant parliamentary\r\ncommissions. This Strategy’s goal is to establish an\r\noptimal ratio between the different energy resources. The\r\npresent diversification of energy resources meets this\r\nobjective. However, there is no alternative to the\r\nexpansion of nuclear- power electricity-generating sources\r\nafter the year 2010, according to this Strategy.\r\nTogether with the development of nuclear power,\r\nBulgaria continues to pay active attention to the\r\napplication of nuclear methods and techniques in\r\nmedicine, agriculture and industry.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating my\r\nGovernment’s support for the Agency’s activities. We are\r\nconfident that, under the able leadership of its Director\r\nGeneral, Mr. Hans Blix, it will meet its new challenges,\r\nas he and previous speakers have pointed out. Bulgaria is\r\ndetermined to be a reliable partner of the Agency in these\r\nendeavours.\r\nMr. Powles (New Zealand): My delegation has\r\nsupported the adoption of a draft resolution under this\r\nitem for many years, and we are grateful to the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) for his report on the activities of the Agency. It\r\nprovides a good overview of the important issues\r\ncurrently on the Agency’s agenda. We see the Agency as\r\nplaying an extremely important role in many issues, from\r\nfostering research into the peaceful uses of nuclear energy\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nto upholding the nuclear non-proliferation regime. In\r\ncarrying out this diverse range of functions, the IAEA is a\r\nmodel of efficiency and effectiveness. As in previous years,\r\nNew Zealand therefore fully supports the adoption of the\r\nrelevant draft resolution, and is pleased to have once again\r\nbeen able to co-sponsor it.\r\nThis year has also marked a milestone in New\r\nZealand’s relationship with the Agency. At this year’s\r\nGeneral Conference in September, New Zealand took a seat\r\non the Agency’s Board of Governors. It is the first time my\r\ncountry has been represented on the Board. We sought\r\nelection in recognition of the fact that the Agency’s\r\nnon-proliferation and other activities are of increasing\r\nrelevance to all countries, including countries such as New\r\nZealand, without major nuclear industries. We are\r\nespecially grateful to our colleagues in our regional group,\r\nthe South-East Asia and Pacific group, for their support for\r\nour candidature, and we look forward to working closely\r\nwith other members of the Board on the important issues\r\naddressed by the Agency.\r\nFor those reasons, the Agency is now more than ever\r\nbefore a focus for New Zealand. It seems to us an\r\nimportant time in the history of the Agency. Even the most\r\ncursory examination of the Director General’s report would\r\nhighlight the crucial role the Agency is playing in some of\r\nthe key issues that the international community is\r\nattempting to address. I should like to outline some of the\r\nareas to which New Zealand attaches considerable\r\nimportance.\r\nWe believe that the IAEA will have an important role\r\nin the implementation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT). We expect that the Agency will work\r\nclosely with the provisional technical secretariat soon to be\r\nestablished in Vienna. My delegation believes that there\r\nwill be many opportunities for cooperation between these\r\ntwo organizations in both the administrative and technical\r\nareas. Much can be learned from the IAEA’s experience\r\nover the last 40 years. However, we expect that the benefits\r\nof cooperation will flow both ways, and that many\r\nsynergies will be found.\r\nThe Assembly will recall the importance New Zealand\r\nattached to the successful conclusion of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The end of nuclear testing in our\r\nregion provided one of this year’s highlights for my\r\ncountry. However, the long-held concerns of New Zealand\r\nand other members of the South Pacific Forum regarding\r\nthe potential environmental effects of nuclear testing\r\nremain. In this context, New Zealand commends the\r\nAgency for its support of the international advisory\r\ncommittee’s study of the radiological situation at Mururoa\r\nand Fangatau atolls. We hope that this study will provide\r\nanswers about the effects of past nuclear testing.\r\nAnother issue of direct concern to my region is the\r\nshipment of nuclear material through the South Pacific.\r\nNew Zealand and the other countries in the region agree\r\nthat these shipments should be carried out in accordance\r\nwith the highest international safety standards. We\r\nendorse the Agency’s intention to keep the regulations\r\nunder review to ensure that they remain abreast of\r\nscientific and technological developments. A successful\r\nconclusion to the negotiations on a convention on the\r\nsafety of radioactive waste management will further\r\nreinforce high safety standards. We also believe that\r\nnegotiations on a convention on liability for nuclear\r\ndamage should be speedily concluded, and that the\r\nconvention should include environmental damage within\r\nits scope.\r\nThe Agency is also closely involved in efforts to\r\nresolve tension in two areas of great concern to my\r\ncountry. New Zealand has welcomed the Agency’s\r\neffective implementation of the Security Council\r\nresolutions on Iraq, and calls upon that country to\r\ncooperate fully with the Agency’s teams. We also support\r\nthe Agency’s efforts to implement the binding safeguards\r\nagreement with the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, and urge that country’s authorities to return to full\r\ncompliance with its provisions. New Zealand’s\r\nmembership in the Korea Energy Development\r\nOrganization (KEDO) is designed in part to encourage\r\nmoves in that direction.\r\nThese two experiences give ample evidence that the\r\nissue of non-proliferation is not an academic one. They\r\nalso underscore the need for effective safeguards. For\r\nthese reasons, my delegation would like to single out the\r\nAgency’s programme to strengthen the safeguards\r\nsystem — among the Agency’s wide range of important\r\nactivities — as being particularly crucial. The experience\r\nin Iraq has demonstrated that traditional safeguards are\r\nnot sufficient in themselves to provide full confidence in\r\nthe non-proliferation system. It is now essential that\r\nadditional measures be adopted to guard against the risk\r\nof clandestine nuclear activities.\r\nNew Zealand accordingly strongly supports\r\nProgramme 93 + 2, which has been developed to address\r\nthis problem. We welcome the measures that the Agency\r\nhas already been able to adopt under its existing authority,\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nbut it is clear that further, complementary measures will\r\nalso be needed to achieve a credible and effective system.\r\nThe capability to detect undeclared nuclear activities is\r\nfundamental to the credibility of the Agency and to\r\neffective safeguards. Indeed, it is a precondition for a non-\r\nproliferation regime in which we can all have faith and\r\nconfidence.\r\nMy delegation understands that the IAEA’s committee\r\non strengthening the effectiveness and improving the\r\nefficiency of the safeguards system has just completed its\r\nsecond meeting. We appreciate the progress that has been\r\nmade towards drafting a model protocol to enhance existing\r\nsafeguards agreements. We urge the IAEA and Member\r\nStates to make every effort to bring this process to an early\r\nand successful conclusion.\r\nTruly effective safeguards are an essential complement\r\nto the CTBT and will provide a foundation for further\r\nnuclear disarmament measures. The additional measures in\r\nthe model protocol will be directly relevant to the\r\nimplementation of a cut-off convention. In short, New\r\nZealand — and, we believe, the whole international\r\ncommunity — is looking to the Agency for the final\r\ncompletion of this important and urgent task.\r\nTo underscore the importance we attach to this issue,\r\nmy delegation notes that strengthened and effective\r\nsafeguards are fundamental to the operation of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty in 1995 was a major\r\nadvance in nuclear non-proliferation. Next year will see the\r\nstart of the enhanced NPT review process, to which my\r\ncountry attaches considerable importance. From the\r\nperspective of the IAEA, it is clear what is expected. I\r\nquote from the Principles and Objectives adopted at last\r\nyear’s Review Conference:\r\n“International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards\r\nshould be regularly assessed and evaluated. Decisions\r\nadopted by its Board of Governors (...) should be\r\nsupported and implemented and the Agency’s\r\ncapability to detect undeclared nuclear activities\r\nshould be increased.” (NPT/Conf.1995/32 (Part I,\r\nannex, para. 11)\r\nBut the Agency’s involvement in the NPT review\r\nprocess does not stop at developing enhanced safeguards.\r\nOnce again, the secretariat of the Agency and Member\r\nStates will be examining the implementation of articles III\r\nand IV of the Treaty. My delegation looks forward to\r\ncooperating with other Members in the three-year review\r\nprocess, culminating in the next Review Conference in the\r\nyear 2000.\r\nIt is clear that the activities of the Agency are\r\nrelevant to all countries, not just to those with nuclear\r\nindustries. New Zealand looks forward to playing its part\r\nin ensuring the continuing effectiveness of the Agency.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation welcomes the detailed and\r\nbalanced report on the activities of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) since the issuance of its\r\n1995 annual report (GC(40)/8), just introduced by the\r\nIAEA Director General, Mr. Hans Blix.\r\nDuring the past year, important progress has been\r\nachieved in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in my\r\ncountry and in the international community. At the\r\ndomestic level, the national Government, owing to radical\r\neconomic reforms, has made progress in the far-reaching\r\nprocess of bilateral cooperation with countries committed\r\nto the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nIn this connection, Argentine corporations are\r\nfinalizing the construction of a third reactor for research\r\non and the production of radioisotopes, contracted for by\r\na friendly country.\r\nIn addition, the Argentine Atomic Energy\r\nCommission, which has half a century of experience, has\r\ninitiated the final phase of the design of a modern,\r\nmodular low-power reactor with a high degree of safety.\r\nThis reactor could be used to generate electric power for\r\ncities with more than 200,000 inhabitants or for the\r\ndesalination of sea water. Argentina is firmly prepared to\r\nshare this technology with interested countries that have\r\na firm policy of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nWith regard to Argentina’s relations with the\r\nAgency, I wish to stress that we are continuing to provide\r\ncomplete support for technical cooperation activities. My\r\ncountry provides the IAEA with technical experts for\r\nspecific cooperation projects with other countries. In\r\naddition, we offer regular training and education courses\r\nfor interns from other member States of the IAEA.\r\nWe believe it is necessary for member States of the\r\nIAEA to make voluntary contributions in order to\r\nimplement fully the Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nprogramme. In this context, we would like to stress the\r\nimportance for national economies of regional\r\nprogrammes for the development of nuclear energy.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nAccordingly, my Government consistently supports the\r\nprogramme established under the Regional Cooperative\r\nArrangements for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and\r\nTechnology in Latin America (ARCAL). We congratulate\r\nthe secretariat of the Agency for its important efforts in\r\nrecent months, in cooperation with the countries of the\r\nregion, aimed at updating and modernizing that programme.\r\nIn addition, within the regional framework, we\r\ncontinue to strengthen the work of the Agency for the\r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (OPANAL). In this context, I should like to refer\r\nto resolution C/E/res.27, which was adopted by that\r\norganization, and which promotes cooperation and\r\nconsultation between members of the various nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones.\r\nWith respect to the strengthening of the IAEA\r\nsafeguards system, we have initiated work with the\r\nsecretariat of the Agency with a view to implementing part\r\n1 of Programme “93 + 2” in Argentine nuclear installations.\r\nWe urge States participating in the intergovernmental\r\ncommittee to finalize negotiations on part 2 of that\r\nprogramme. Completion would make it possible to improve\r\nthe current safeguards system by providing the Agency with\r\nbetter instruments to prevent or detect possible deviations\r\nfrom the non-proliferation system.\r\nIn this context, and in order to ensure that such\r\nmodernization is effective, we believe it essential for the\r\nnew safeguards system to be universal in application and,\r\naccordingly, completely independent of what kind of\r\nagreements countries have with the Agency.\r\nMy country wishes to express its profound satisfaction\r\nat the recent entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety. In this respect, the national executive authority has\r\ninitiated procedures so that Congress can ratify the\r\nConvention.\r\nWith regard to the IAEA Standing Committee on Civil\r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage, the Argentine Government\r\nwelcomes the results achieved at the most recent meeting\r\non the negotiation of a draft protocol on additional\r\nfinancing of a universal nature. We hope that this process\r\nwill lead to the convening of a diplomatic conference in\r\n1997.\r\nWe are also following with particular interest the\r\ninitiatives of the international community with regard to the\r\ntransport of radioactive waste by sea, and we believe that\r\nthe adoption by the International Maritime Organization of\r\na code on the safe transport of irradiated nuclear material,\r\nplutonium and highly radioactive waste is an important\r\nfirst step to safeguard the interests of coastal States.\r\nFinally, I wish to reiterate my congratulations to the\r\nDirector General of the IAEA, who we believe is one of\r\nthe most important personalities in the system, and,\r\nthrough him, to the entire staff of the secretariat of the\r\nAgency for their well-known professionalism, which has\r\nbeen manifested in the important results achieved by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in the past year.\r\nMr. González Gálvez (Mexico) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour and a pleasure to express, on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of Mexico, our appreciation to\r\nMr. Blix for the report on the work done last year by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which he\r\nleads so brilliantly and competently. Again, we\r\ncongratulate him and reiterate our support and\r\nappreciation.\r\nAlthough we understand that Mr. Blix has decided\r\nnot to stand for re-election as Director Agency of the\r\nAgency, my Government wishes to thank him in\r\nparticular for his work on the development of the reactors\r\nat Laguna Verde and for a series of projects on the use of\r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes, as well as for his\r\nfirm support for the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which prohibits\r\nnuclear weapons in Latin America. We wish to thank\r\nhim, in his capacity as an official and as a colleague, for\r\nhis contribution to the cause of peace, to which we are all\r\ncommitted.\r\nThe detailed report of the work carried out by the\r\nAgency in the different areas of its mandate gives us a\r\nclear picture of the valuable efforts made in the fields of\r\nnuclear-generated electricity and the use of nuclear\r\ntechnology for human health, agriculture, food and\r\nenvironmental protection, and the progress achieved with\r\nregard to technical cooperation and nuclear and\r\nradiological safety.\r\nMexico supports the work of the Agency in carrying\r\nout its important mandate and advocates balance, which\r\nwe consider essential, between its security activities and\r\nthose for cooperation and technical assistance. We attach\r\nparticular importance to all aspects of the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, of which the\r\ninternational safeguards regime is an essential element.\r\nWe are particularly pleased with the recent signing of the\r\nTreaties of Bangkok and Pelindaba, which establish\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia and Africa.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nWe hope that the Treaty of Bangkok will resolve the\r\ncurrent problems with regard to the delimitation of that\r\nzone and its interpretation by certain nuclear Powers in that\r\narea.\r\nWe also welcome the progress achieved in\r\nstrengthening the IAEA safeguards system, such as the\r\nestablishment of an open-ended committee to draft a\r\nprotocol for the implementation of the measures of\r\nProgramme “93 + 2”, which require additional authority\r\nand complementary judicial powers, such as broader access\r\nto information and the expansion of physical access.These\r\nmeasures should, of course, be consistent with the rights\r\nand constitutions of States.\r\nMexico’s desire to participate actively in strengthening\r\nthe safeguards system was emphasized in a formal offer to\r\nhold in our country field trials for the measures contained\r\nin part 2 of Programme “93 + 2”.\r\nFor the time being, the voluntary offer provides\r\nneither a binding commitment nor any precedent for the\r\nimplementation of the safeguards the IAEA is carrying out\r\nin Mexican territory by virtue of the Treaty of Tlatelolco\r\nand the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT). With Mexico’s ratification of the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety on 26 July 1996, the\r\nnecessary number of ratifications was reached for the\r\nConvention’s entry force, just four days ago. Mexico has\r\nthereby reiterated its lasting commitment to the objectives\r\nof the IAEA and its interest in attaining its goals in\r\nconnection with nuclear safety. Since the process has\r\nalready been launched in the IAEA, the Board of Governors\r\nshould be enlarged to enhance its representativeness and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nThere should also be greater clarity with regard to\r\ncriteria for the appointment of member States to the Board.\r\nAccount should be taken of progress made by member\r\nStates in a specific geographical area — in terms of the\r\npercentage of energy produced from nuclear sources, for\r\nexample. Mexico welcomes the progress made in the\r\npreparatory work on the Convention on Nuclear Safety and\r\nin the management of radioactive waste. At the same time,\r\nwe would like to express our Government’s great interest\r\nin promoting work on the implementation of the\r\nConvention, which should enjoy broad adherence and\r\ninternational consensus on general security principles.\r\nMoreover, the Convention should be applied to all kinds of\r\nradioactive waste, irrespective of its origin, and guarantee\r\nthe protection of human health and the environment.\r\nMexico welcomes the progress made in the review\r\nof the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear\r\nDamage and the preparation of a convention on additional\r\ncompensation which woudl help strengthen the\r\ninternational regime on liability for nuclear damage.\r\nLastly, my delegation allies itself with the support\r\nexpressed by the European Union for the adoption of\r\nmeasures to enhance the Agency’s capacity to detect\r\nundeclared nuclear activities. In this connection, Mexico\r\nwelcomes the establishment of the committee to draft an\r\nadditional protocol to the safeguards agreements that most\r\nStates have already agreed to on a bilateral basis with the\r\nIAEA. In this way, one of the main goals of the Agency\r\ncan be achieved: a strengthened, efficient and universal\r\nsafeguards system.\r\nThe peaceful uses of nuclear energy are increasingly\r\ndiverse and important for development. In Mexico’s\r\nopinion, the IAEA should step up and expand cooperation\r\nand assistance so that we can all benefit from science and\r\ntechnology. At the same time, the growing number of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones and the achievements in\r\nnuclear disarmament, which we hope will continue and\r\nprogress, will mean new and more important obligations\r\nfor the International Atomic Energy Agency in terms of\r\nnuclear safety. The international community’s recognition\r\nof and confidence in the role played by the Agency led\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament, with Mexico’s resolute\r\nsupport, to recommend that the Agency cooperate with\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\r\nin areas where the IAEA has a comparative advantage. Its\r\nexperience will be an important factor in strengthening an\r\neffective system to verify a complete ban on nuclear test\r\nexplosions.\r\nThe Agency headed by Mr. Blix is dynamic and\r\nsolvent and undoubtedly have to cope, as it has thus far,\r\nwith the challenge of growing responsibilities and limited\r\nresources. Its representativeness and effectiveness must be\r\nincreased, as should the transparency of its decision-\r\nmaking processes, and its security and cooperation\r\nactivities must be better balanced. We have confidence in\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency; we have\r\nconfidence in its Director General.\r\nMr. Mazilu (Romania): At the outset, allow me, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation, to congratulate Mr. Hans Blix,\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), for his clear and concise introduction of\r\nthe annual report, which stressed the main achievements\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nand trends of the activity of the Agency over the last year.\r\nMy delegation fully shares the assessments and\r\nproposals contained in this report. We would like to\r\nunderscore the significant contribution of the Director\r\nGeneral to the achievement of the goals laid down in the\r\nAgency’s statute and in the pertinent resolutions adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation endorses the views expressed on this\r\nreport by the delegation of Ireland on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union and the associated countries.\r\nAt the same time, my delegation would like to make\r\nthe following comments on some specific issues. First, as\r\nthe Assembly knows, my country is actively participating\r\nin the ongoing efforts for the wider peaceful use of atomic\r\nenergy, as well in the world community’s démarches\r\ntowards the promotion of the nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime, the basic precondition for establishing a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world.\r\nSecondly, I have the honour to inform the Assembly\r\nthat in April 1996, my country inaugurated the first unit of\r\nthe Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant. By mid-October 1996,\r\nthe unit reached the planned parameters. We would like to\r\nstress that the functioning of this Power Plant highlights our\r\nvery fruitful cooperation with companies from Canada, Italy\r\nand the United States, as well as the qualified technical\r\nassistance received from the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency.\r\nMy Government is aware of its huge responsibility\r\nregarding the safe functioning of this power plant. We have\r\nalready envisaged the necessary steps for environmental\r\nprotection that should accompany its functioning.\r\nThirdly, we appreciate the technical assistance and\r\ncooperation programme undertaken by the Agency. It has\r\nto be emphasized that technical cooperation is the Agency’s\r\nmost directly relevant area of activity to many of its\r\nmembers. We welcome, in particular, those initiatives\r\nundertaken by the Agency to strengthen the Technical\r\nCooperation Programme and to make it more effective and\r\nmore relevant to sustainable development. Technical\r\ncooperation should focus on improvements in management,\r\nsuch as the systematic assessment of the status of radiation\r\nsafety in member States and the planning of time-limited\r\nfollow-up activities. It is the view of my delegation that the\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Technical Cooperation\r\nshould make the necessary recommendation on means to\r\nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of the Technical\r\nCooperation Programme.\r\nMy country expresses hope in the future\r\nmaintenance of the level of technical assistance by the\r\nAgency, with a view to answering the pressing needs of\r\nthe development of its nuclear programme. On its part,\r\nRomania can support the Agency’s cooperation\r\nprogrammes by offering the knowledge and experience of\r\nmany Romanian experts who are ready to work within the\r\nframework of activities carried out by the IAEA.\r\nFourthly, bearing in mind the major aspects of the\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of our\r\ncountry’s economic and social development, we would\r\nonce more like to stress that our country is supporting the\r\nAgency’s measures for strengthening the nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime, within the context of the indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nLikewise, we are determined to further apply in good\r\nfaith the measures contained in Programme 93 + 2. We\r\nalso consider that the adoption of a model protocol\r\nadditional to the comprehensive safeguards agreements\r\nwould be of great importance to the strengthening of the\r\nIAEA’s system of verification of nuclear materials and\r\ninstallations, as well as of other related items. From this\r\nperspective, we share the opinion that this new proposed\r\nadditional protocol should be a balanced document,\r\nacceptable to all parties. Furthermore, we think that the\r\nurgent adoption of this legal instrument would represent\r\na new significant step towards the consolidation of the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nFifthly, our country firmly supports the measures\r\ntaken by the Agency to improve the safe operation of\r\nnuclear plants and storage of radioactive waste. We would\r\nlike to commend the Agency for the intense activity it has\r\ncarried out in this area, as well as in the field of\r\npreventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the tragic accident at\r\nChernobyl provided an opportune moment for the Agency\r\nto review the consequences of the accident and the\r\nlessons that have been learned. It is the view of my\r\nGovernment that the Agency should take further\r\nnecessary steps to prevent similar accidents in the future,\r\nbearing in mind the tragic lesson of Chernobyl.\r\nWe would like to emphasize the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation and partnership in addressing\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nnuclear safety concerns. We welcome the measures taken\r\nby the European Union for the strengthening of regulatory\r\nregimes, including the establishment of a nuclear safety\r\naccount. We also consider it appropriate to put into effect\r\nbilateral cooperation projects in this field.\r\nThere is no doubt that the primary responsibility for\r\nnuclear safety rests with national Governments. At the same\r\ntime, we welcome the initiatives taken by the IAEA to\r\nstrengthen cooperation and mutual assistance, and its\r\ncontinuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture.\r\nWe appreciate that the Convention on Nuclear Safety is a\r\nmajor accomplishment of the Agency in this field. This\r\nlegal instrument binds countries to basic principles covering\r\nthe regulation, management and operation of land-based\r\ncivil nuclear power plants. It is our hope that as many\r\ncountries as possible will ratify this Convention as soon as\r\npossible. My Government considers that all should be done\r\nat the national and international levels not only to limit the\r\neffects of nuclear accidents, but to prevent them completely\r\nand to guarantee the safe operation of every nuclear plant.\r\nRegarding radioactive waste management, my\r\nGovernment appreciates the efforts made to formulate a\r\ndraft convention, which should stipulate clear\r\nresponsibilities in this field in order to avoid unacceptable\r\npublic and environmental risks now and in the future. It is\r\nnecessary to establish an effective nuclear liability regime,\r\nproviding adequate and equitable compensation to victims\r\nin the event of a nuclear accident. At the last session of the\r\nStanding Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage,\r\nbroad agreement was achieved on the revision of the\r\nVienna Convention and important conclusions were reached\r\non supplementary funding. We fully share the view\r\nexpressed by other Member States that all necessary steps\r\nshould be taken to strengthen the international nuclear\r\nliability regime.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to reiterate the full support\r\nof my Government for promoting the Agency’s\r\nprogrammes and activities as noted in the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly for its consideration.\r\nMr. Tonishi (Japan): My delegation would like to\r\nthank the Director General of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Hans Blix, for his\r\ncomprehensive and clear introduction of the Agency’s\r\nreport, on which I would like to make some remarks.\r\nFirst of all, I note with satisfaction that the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was\r\nadopted by the General Assembly with the support of the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States. I welcome the\r\nadoption of the Treaty as a historic step towards nuclear\r\ndisarmament. It is hoped that, with its accumulated\r\nexpertise in the field of nuclear safeguards, the IAEA will\r\nassist the CTBT Organization, which is to be located in\r\nVienna, in its efforts to implement the Treaty effectively.\r\nProgress has been achieved based on the Framework\r\nAgreement between the United States and the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. This includes the conclusion\r\nin December last year of the Agreement between the\r\nKorean Peninsula Energy Development Organization\r\n(KEDO) and the DPRK on the supply of a light-water\r\nreactor project and six on-site surveys carried out by\r\nKEDO. Japan calls upon the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea to adhere strictly to the Framework\r\nAgreement and strongly urges it to implement fully the\r\nsafeguards agreement with the IAEA in order to dispel\r\nthe concerns of the international community. My\r\nGovernment continues to commend and support the\r\nDirector General and his staff for their consistent and\r\nimpartial efforts to implement the safeguards agreement\r\nbetween the IAEA and the DPRK, including their efforts\r\nto monitor the freeze of specified facilities, as requested\r\nby the Security Council.\r\nThe experiences of the IAEA illustrated the need to\r\nstrengthen further its safeguards system. The Agency has\r\nalready begun to address this need, but it is particularly\r\nimportant that it improve its ability to detect undeclared\r\nnuclear-development activities. Japan supports Programme\r\n“93+2”, which seeks to formulate measures to strengthen\r\nthe effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the\r\nsafeguards system. My Government, with the aim of\r\nensuring the full and early implementation of this\r\nProgramme, will continue to take an active part in the\r\nwork of the committee as it drafts a model additional\r\nprotocol to the current safeguards agreement.\r\nWith regard to nuclear safety, the entry into force on\r\n24 October of this year of the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety is truly an epoch-making development. Japan is\r\nhopeful that this Convention will ensure a high level of\r\nsafety in the use of nuclear power throughout the world\r\nand appeals to all States to become parties to it. In this\r\nconnection, Japan will continue to contribute to an early\r\nagreement in the ongoing discussions for a convention on\r\nthe safety of radioactive-waste management.\r\nIt is significant that at the Summit on Nuclear Safety\r\nand Security, which was held in Moscow in April of this\r\nyear, the leaders of the G-7 nations and the Russian\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nFederation not only confirmed the main principles relating\r\nto the safety of nuclear power, but also affirmed the\r\nimportance of international cooperation in the field of\r\nnuclear safety. As a means of building upon the\r\nachievements of the Summit in the context of the Asian\r\nregion, where countries are pursuing the introduction of\r\nnuclear-power generation, Japan is preparing to convene the\r\nTokyo conference on nuclear safety in Asia in the early\r\npart of November this year.\r\nJapan attaches great importance to the multilateral\r\ntechnical cooperation activities of the Agency and has\r\nactively contributed both human and financial resources to\r\nthem. It will continue to provide as much support as\r\npossible to help develop and improve human resources,\r\nskills and technology in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy.\r\nThe IAEA plays an essential and expanding role in the\r\npromotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in\r\nmaintaining and strengthening the non-proliferation regime.\r\nI would like to emphasize, in conclusion, that the degree to\r\nwhich the Agency is successful depends ultimately upon the\r\nfirm support of Member States. Japan, for its part, is\r\ndetermined to continue to do its best to further develop this\r\nimportant organization.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I\r\nwould like to commend Mr. Blix, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his\r\ninformative statement. His personal efforts and dedication,\r\nas well as those of the IAEA Secretariat, in pursuance of its\r\nobjectives for peaceful uses of nuclear technology\r\nthroughout the world, in accordance with its statute, have\r\nalways been appreciated by my country.\r\nMy delegation has reviewed the annual report of the\r\nIAEA for 1995. We are pleased to see that the Agency\r\ncontinues to make progress on its mandated objectives and\r\nduties. I take this opportunity to comment on some of the\r\nissues mentioned in the report.\r\nFirst, on the technical cooperation programme of the\r\nAgency, my delegation reiterates the importance and\r\nvalidity of this aspect of IAEA duties and the need to\r\nenhance it in an efficient manner. The IAEA role in\r\npromoting peaceful uses of nuclear technology in different\r\nareas, ranging from agriculture to medicine, needs the\r\nattention and support of all members of the Agency. There\r\nis a need for the Agency to focus further on meeting the\r\ndeveloping countries’ requirements and needs for peaceful\r\nutilization of nuclear technology, especially in the energy\r\nsector. It is our view that the activities of the IAEA in\r\nother areas should not adversely affect the operation of\r\nthe technical cooperation programme and that resources\r\nshould be allocated evenly among different programmes\r\nof the Agency.\r\nSecondly, my delegation welcomes the continued\r\nefforts by the Member States in negotiations to agree on\r\na protocol on strengthening the safeguard regime. Iran, as\r\nan original signatory of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), has always\r\nadhered to the Agency’s safeguards, has pursued an open\r\nand transparent policy in this respect and will continue to\r\nsupport the effectiveness of the safeguard regime.\r\nWe believe the strengthened safeguard system should\r\nenhance international cooperation in peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technology. Furthermore, the protocol should not\r\nbe limited only to those countries that already have\r\nfull-scope safeguard agreements with the Agency. To\r\naddress the concerns of the international community and\r\nachieve its stated objectives, the protocol should serve as\r\nan independent instrument which commits all States\r\nparties to the NPT on an equal footing. Hence, the\r\nnuclear-weapon States should be equally committed to the\r\nprotocol.\r\nThirdly, on the issue of nuclear-weapon-free zones,\r\nI would like to recall that despite more than 20 years of\r\ndiscussions and resolutions on the subject, the Middle\r\nEastern countries have yet to agree on the establishment\r\nof a nuclear-weapon-free zone in their region. This is due\r\nmainly to Israel’s refusal — with the full support of\r\ncertain Powers — to join the NPT and place its facilities\r\nunder IAEA safeguards.\r\nIran believes that establishment of nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones in different regions of the world is of the\r\nutmost importance and, for its part, would spare no effort\r\nin promoting this concept in all parts of the world,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East. The continued operation\r\nof unsafeguarded and non-peaceful nuclear reactors in\r\nIsrael is a source of grave concern to the international\r\ncommunity in general and to the Middle East region in\r\nparticular. As long as the Powers behind Israel do not\r\ngive up their double-standard attitude and continue their\r\nself-serving policy of ignoring Israel’s refusal to join the\r\nNPT and have its facilities placed under IAEA\r\nsafeguards, the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nthe Middle East will remain a distant goal. My country,\r\nwhich initiated the proposal for establishment of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in 1974, is\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nprepared to support any genuine and practical plan for its\r\nrealization.\r\nMy delegation notes the developments in the\r\ndiscussions on the revision of article VI of the Agency’s\r\nStatute. It is a fact that certain regions do not enjoy\r\nadequate representation in the IAEA’s main decision-\r\nmaking body. This issue has been discussed in the Agency\r\nover the past 20 years without any concrete results. Given\r\nthe political realities in the world and the three-fold\r\nincrease in the Agency’s membership, we hope that an\r\nagreement on this issue might be reached by the next\r\nsession of the Agency’s General Conference.\r\nWith regard to the classification of member States in\r\nregional groups, it is our deep conviction that the grouping\r\nof member States should be consistent with the\r\ndetermination to see continued progress in the work of the\r\nAgency and should not be seen as a self-serving policy of\r\nsome member States without due regard for the political\r\nrealities of the regions. While supporting the right of every\r\nmember State to be represented on the IAEA Board of\r\nGovernors, it is our firm belief that member States that\r\ndesire to do so should not represent any region so long as\r\nits membership in the region concerned and its\r\nrepresentation of the region are not agreed to by the\r\ncountries that are located in that region. Furthermore, the\r\nmember States of each region should have the final\r\ndecision on accepting any new member to the group. This\r\nis not an issue that should be forced upon regions.\r\nThe last issue I should like to raise concerns the\r\nunjustifiable insistence of some nations on the unilateral\r\nevaluation and certification of the activities of other\r\nmembers of the Agency. As was reaffirmed in the\r\nDeclaration of the 1995 Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), the IAEA remains the\r\ncompetent authority to verify and assure that the\r\nobligations of States Parties to the NPT are being fulfilled\r\nand that nothing is done to undermine the authority of the\r\nAgency in that regard. My delegation opposes the\r\ncontinued use of unilateral mechanisms for the evaluation,\r\nqualification and certification of some member States,\r\nsince they are not consistent with the letter and spirit of\r\nthe NPT, the principles of the sovereign equality of States\r\nand non-intervention and they undermine the authority of\r\nthe IAEA.\r\nI will conclude by reiterating our support for Mr.\r\nBlix and the Agency in promoting cooperation in the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy and the non-proliferation\r\nof nuclear weapons.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\nthe programme of work for the remainder of October and\r\nfor the month of November was issued this morning as\r\ndocument A/INF/51/3/Rev.1/Add.1. The list of speakers\r\nfor each of the items listed in that document is now open.\r\nI will in due course announce dates for the consideration\r\nof other agenda items, and keep the Assembly informed\r\nof any additions or changes.\r\nAnnouncement\r\nThe President: I should like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning agenda item 21, entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including\r\nspecial economic assistance”, which is scheduled for\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly on Thursday,\r\n21 November. The President of the General Assembly\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 28 October 1996\r\nhas requested His Excellency Mr. Ernst Sucharipa,\r\nPermanent Representative of Austria, who so ably\r\ncoordinated informal consultations during the fiftieth\r\nsession on draft resolutions under agenda item 21, to assist\r\nhim in the same capacity at this session, and Ambassador\r\nSucharipa has graciously accepted.\r\nI request those delegations intending to submit draft\r\nresolutions under agenda item 21 to do so as early as\r\npossible in order to allow time, if need be, for\r\nnegotiations with a view to reaching consensus on the\r\ndraft resolutions. In this connection, I should like to\r\ninform members that the first meeting of the informal\r\nconsultations will be announced in the Journal.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
