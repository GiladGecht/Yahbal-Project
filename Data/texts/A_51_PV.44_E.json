(Malaysia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Samhan (United\r\nArab Emirates), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3:05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 47\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): In\r\nconnection with the item before the Assembly, I should like\r\nto remind members that at its 126th plenary meeting of the\r\nfiftieth session, held on 16 September 1996, the General\r\nAssembly decided that the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council should continue its\r\nwork, taking into account the progress achieved during the\r\nforty-eighth, forty-ninth and fiftieth sessions and the views\r\nexpressed during the fifty-first session of the Assembly, and\r\nshould submit a report to the Assembly of its fifty-first\r\nsession, including any agreed recommendations.\r\nMr. Zlenko (Ukraine): It may be recalled that the\r\nrepresentative of Ukraine was the last speaker in the debate\r\non this agenda item at the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Today, at the fifty-first session, we have the\r\nhonour to open the discussion on the same subject, which\r\nis the backbone of the issue of United Nations reform. It\r\nshows that we have a sincere interest in and are not\r\nindifferent to the fate of the United Nations today and in\r\nthe future.\r\nIt is the view of our delegation that a revitalized and\r\nreformed United Nations would be impossible without a\r\nmore representative and open Security Council. Delays in\r\nresolving this important matter impair the United Nations\r\nability to respond adequately to the challenges of the\r\npresent and to enhance the Organization’s prestige in\r\ncontemporary international relations.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine shares the view that,\r\nnotwithstanding the absence of sound positive results, the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly was the most\r\nsuccessful so far in the deliberations of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nNow, at least, we have a better picture of what is not\r\nacceptable to Member States among the schemes to\r\nexpand the Security Council. The addition of only two\r\ncountries to permanent membership in the future Council\r\nhas clearly been ruled out by the Working Group.\r\nEqually, the permanent members of the Security Council\r\nare not ready to agree to any change in the status of the\r\nveto.\r\nUnfortunately, such an outcome is not enough to\r\nform the basis for an agreement that could bring us to a\r\nbreakthrough in resolving the issue.\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nWhat makes the work of the Working Group so\r\nineffective and not focus-oriented?\r\nIn our opinion, we are sitting too long at the starting\r\nline in the presentation of our national positions. Three\r\nyears after the Working Group was created, we have not\r\neven entered the stage of negotiations. Although there have\r\nbeen a lot of interesting proposals, they have not received\r\nadequate responses from delegations. Even the most\r\nthorough proposal, that of Italy, does not enjoy even the\r\nbasic understanding by members of some of its most\r\nappealing elements.\r\nIn this context, the delegation of Ukraine proposes to\r\nrestructure the discussions in the Working Group towards\r\ninitiating an unbiased and thorough debate on each of the\r\nproposals presented by Member States. We hope that such\r\nan option will help to determine both the merits and the\r\nshortcomings of the proposals and will use the constructive\r\nelements in the further work of the Working Group.\r\nAnother negative factor in our discussion, which we\r\ncannot help but mention, is the vague positions of the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, who often\r\nprefer to make hints instead of speaking straight. This\r\nuncertainty, as we see it, can only be interpreted as an\r\nunwillingness to accept any change in the present status of\r\nthe Security Council. If that is the case, we can only\r\nexpress our regret.\r\nTo know better the position of the five on the issue of\r\nequitable representation on and the increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and on other related\r\nmatters, we would like to request the Secretariat to prepare\r\na working paper that would reflect the relevant positions of\r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council on all\r\naforementioned issues. We believe that such a paper will be\r\nvery helpful to many of us, if not to all.\r\nSerious concerns have emerged in connection with\r\ncertain statements concerning the decision-making process\r\nin the Open-ended Working Group. The failure to achieve\r\ntangible results is attributed by some to the principle of\r\nconsensus which we apply here. The delegation of Ukraine\r\navails itself of this opportunity to state clearly that any\r\nother way of adopting a decision on the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council will have the most negative consequences,\r\nboth political and material, for the future of this\r\nOrganization. A refusal of the permanent members to\r\nsupport and then to ratify the amendments to the Charter\r\ncould result in unpredictable political implications as far as\r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions is\r\nconcerned.\r\nThe self-imposed rule of consensus serves our Group\r\nas an effective guarantor against such an unfavourable\r\ndevelopment of events and, in the long run, as a\r\nguarantee of the preservation of our Organization as a\r\nviable instrument for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nDo we have the potential to reach a compromise?\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine has no doubts about this. The\r\nmost persuasive proof to this effect is presented in the\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group. For the first\r\ntime in three years, the Member States agreed on a\r\nsubstantial part of it, notwithstanding all the differences\r\nthat still remain.\r\nIn our opinion, we should turn to the basic\r\nconceptual principle of negotiations: either to negotiate\r\nabout the goal and reach an agreement or to negotiate\r\nabout positions and find ourselves on a dead-end street.\r\nMy delegation believes that we should take step-by-step\r\ndecisions, each of which would facilitate the adoption of\r\nthe next one.\r\nAt this stage, we believe, the least controversial\r\nissue is the number of seats in the expanded Security\r\nCouncil. Using the principle of the lowest common\r\ndenominator, the Working Group could have taken a\r\ndecision to expand the Council to 25 or 26 members. My\r\ndelegation put forward this proposal during the work of\r\nour Working Group and would like to reaffirm that it is\r\nstill on the negotiating table.\r\nOne of the positive aspects of such a decision lies in\r\nits confidence-building potential. Once assured that the\r\ninterests of all regional groups have been met, Member\r\nStates, not afraid of being overwhelmed, would be more\r\ninclined to reach an agreement. At the same time, this\r\nwould make further negotiations more parameter-oriented.\r\nMy delegation would like to stress that any\r\nexpansion of the Security Council should take into\r\naccount the legitimate interests of the Eastern European\r\nregional group, which has more than doubled its\r\nmembership in recent years. We note with satisfaction\r\nthat this idea has found its place in the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group to the General Assembly.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nAnother basic pillar of the work of the Group should\r\nbe the strict and faithful observance of the fundamental\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. That is why my delegation is not in a position to\r\nsupport the application of the important principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution to the category of\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. The new\r\npermanent members, if there should be any, should be\r\nchosen on an ad hoc basis, as stipulated by the Charter.\r\nThus, any State which is individually capable of assuming\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at\r\nboth the regional and global levels can become a permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council through the relevant\r\nprocedure.\r\nIn this context, we think that only Germany and Japan\r\nmeet the criteria. Ukraine supports the desire of these\r\ncountries to acquire permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. This process should be accompanied by an\r\nincrease in the number of non-permanent members, due\r\nregard being specially paid, inter alia, to equitable\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\nThe goal of the expansion of the Security Council is\r\nto make it more representative and balanced and its work\r\nmore effective and transparent. Obviously, current realities\r\nshould be properly taken into account. The principle of\r\nbalance does not permit one group to dominate the other\r\ngroups of States and encourages States to seek cooperation\r\nand agreement in resolving problems. In our opinion,\r\nbalance in the composition of the Security Council can be\r\nreached by an increase in the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers, primarily from the developing countries.\r\nUkraine believes that, if two additional seats for\r\npermanent members in the Security Council are created, the\r\nnumber of non-permanent members should be increased by\r\neight, which would make a total of 18 non-permanent\r\nmembers. The additional seats for non-permanent members\r\ncould be distributed as follows: four seats for Asian and\r\nAfrican countries; two seats for the regional group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean countries; one seat for the regional\r\ngroup of Western European and other countries; and one\r\nseat for the regional group of Eastern European countries.\r\nThus, the Ukrainian proposal may be defined by the\r\nformula “2+8”. Through our proposal, we can achieve a\r\nbalance by increasing the representation of developing\r\ncountries in the Security Council to 13. If the current\r\ndecision-making procedure is retained, the approval of a\r\ndecision in the enlarged Council would require 15 votes in\r\nfavour, provided that none of the permanent members\r\nvotes against. With 13 votes, the developing countries\r\nwould have an effective group veto, without leaving the\r\nveto as the prerogative of any one State.\r\nAs to the status of these new non-permanent seats,\r\nUkraine supports a well-known proposal by Italy. At the\r\nsame time, to accommodate the interests of small\r\ncountries, the following modification might be considered.\r\nFirst, regional groups might be given the right to\r\ndetermine how many seats — except one that would stay\r\nunder the regular two-year rotation rule — would be used\r\nfor frequent rotation. Secondly, the regional groups might\r\nbe permitted to use their non-permanent seats — except\r\none that would stay under the regular two-year rotation\r\nrule — on a one-year rotation basis.\r\nThe position of Ukraine on the veto issue is well\r\nknown. We consider the existence of the power of veto,\r\nunder present political realities, to be unjustified. In the\r\nframework of the Open-ended Working Group, our\r\ndelegation voiced its support for the idea of the so-called\r\n“diluted veto”, as well as for restricted implementation of\r\nthe veto by the Security Council permanent members. In\r\nour opinion, these modifications could have limited the\r\nopportunities of the permanent members to use the veto\r\nonly in their own national interests, to the detriment of\r\nthe interests of the international community as a whole.\r\nBut one has to be a realist. We do understand that only\r\nthe permanent members themselves can abolish or at least\r\nmodify the right to veto.\r\nIn this context, we believe that a speedy solution to\r\nthe question of the expansion of the Security Council in\r\norder to balance its membership will contribute to the\r\nvoluntary limitation of the use of veto by the permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nThe so-called Cluster II issues are an indispensable\r\npart of the Security Council reform, but we are deeply\r\nconvinced that they should not be held hostage to the\r\nmain issue of enlarging the Council or depend on how\r\nthat issue will be resolved. My delegation assesses\r\npositively all the changes that have occurred in the\r\nworking methods and procedures of the Security Council\r\nand considers it necessary to consolidate them.\r\nUnfortunately, “common sense”, as Voltaire once\r\nsaid, “is not so common”; that holds true in the work of\r\nour Working Group. Quite often, we see that wisdom\r\nyields to political ambition, thus complicating an issue\r\nwhich is vital for the very existence of our Organization.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nMy delegation strongly believes that, if we want to get\r\nalong, we have to meet with dignity the new demands and\r\nthe new challenges facing this Organization and each of its\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): The General Assembly is\r\nconsidering the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council for the\r\nfourth time without, I am afraid, any immediate solution\r\nwithin reach. This fact calls for an urgent reassessment of\r\nthe objectives contained in resolution 48/26, the basis of\r\nour reform exercise.\r\nWe have decided to speak early in this year’s debate\r\non agenda item 47 not because our immediate national\r\ninterests are at stake, but because Austria has a long-lasting\r\ntradition of supporting a strong United Nations. The issue\r\nbefore us is closely related to our desire to see a healthier\r\nOrganization getting prepared for the challenges of the next\r\ncentury.\r\nWith the adoption of resolution 48/26, the General\r\nAssembly recognized the need to review the membership of\r\nthe Security Council: first, in view of the substantial\r\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations,\r\nespecially from developing countries; and secondly, in view\r\nof the substantial changes in international relations.\r\nAt the founding of the United Nations, the ratio of the\r\noverall membership of the United Nations to the\r\nmembership of the Security Council was roughly 6:1. After\r\nthe 1965 enlargement it was 8:1. The process of\r\ndecolonization has brought it up to about 12:1. It seems\r\nobvious, therefore, that the large increase in the overall\r\nmembership of the United Nations has to be reflected in the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council, taking into account the\r\ncriterion of equitable geographical representation. The need\r\nfor an efficient Council, however, imposes numerical limits.\r\nThe Working Group unanimously agreed on these\r\nprinciples.\r\nPursuant to a widely shared view, the current structure\r\nof the Council does not reflect the international political\r\nand economic changes of recent decades. The Security\r\nCouncil, bearing the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, no longer\r\nrepresents the universality and plurality of its mandators,\r\nthat is the members of the General Assembly. Lack of\r\nrepresentation engenders lack of legitimacy; hence the\r\nurgency for Security Council reform.\r\nA large number of Member States highly value the\r\nmerits of the concept of cohabitation and cooperation\r\nbetween permanent and non-permanent membership as it\r\nhas evolved over the last five decades. While these\r\ncountries — and I count Austria among them — favour\r\na balanced enlargement in these existing categories, others\r\nconcentrate their reform proposals inter alia on a\r\nmodified model for non-permanent membership.\r\nIf the reform process is to succeed, we must break\r\nout of this well-known dilemma of our discussions in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group. And, if I may refer to the\r\nstatement we have just heard by our colleague from\r\nUkraine, what he proposed could be a step in this\r\ndirection. At this stage my delegation would like to pay\r\na special tribute to Ambassador Fredrik Wilhelm\r\nBreitenstein of Finland and to Ambassador Asda\r\nJayanama of Thailand for their patience and untiring\r\nefforts as Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group.\r\nAlthough the deliberations during the fiftieth session\r\nof the General Assembly were substantial, lack of\r\nprogress persisted, which threatens to turn our serious and\r\nambitious efforts into a “never-ending story”. On the\r\noccasion of last year’s Special Commemorative Meeting\r\nof the General Assembly, as well as during this year’s\r\ngeneral debate, an impressive number of Member States\r\nexpressed their deep commitment to multilateralism, and\r\nto a strong and vital United Nations able to contribute to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe overall reform process aimed at restructuring\r\nand revitalizing, modernizing and updating the\r\nOrganization in order to equip it for future challenges has\r\nto be finally brought to a conclusion. The Security\r\nCouncil cannot be an exception. Reform of the Council is\r\na key element in the overall reform process. Let us,\r\ntherefore, redouble our efforts in the search for “general\r\nagreement” on the reform of the Council as stipulated in\r\nthe preambular part of resolution 48/26, and let us find\r\nthe necessary flexibility to meet that goal.\r\nWe believe that the following points could constitute\r\nthe parameters for such general agreement: for reasons of\r\nefficiency, any enlargement should not exceed a total of\r\n25 members. In order to safeguard effectiveness,\r\nenlargement should take full account of the reality and\r\npluralistic nature of today’s world and satisfy the need for\r\nequitable geographical representation.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nThe concept of permanent combined with\r\nnon-permanent, or elected, membership can provide the\r\nnecessary continuity in the Security Council’s work and an\r\nappropriate reflection of the structure of international\r\nrelations. It can safeguard necessary democratic elements to\r\nensure to a sufficient degree the necessary representative\r\nnature of the Council.\r\nCriteria for the choice of permanent members must be\r\npolitical and economic realities, global constructive\r\nengagement of the potential candidates, and their capacity\r\nand willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, in\r\nparticular through participation in and support of\r\npeacekeeping operations. These are general criteria with\r\nworldwide relevance. The principle of equitable\r\ngeographical representation is relevant as well.\r\nFor the election of non-permanent members — again\r\nbased on the principle of geographical representation — the\r\ncurrent criteria listed in Article 23 (1) of the Charter should\r\ncontinue to apply.\r\nAnd, finally, the veto should be limited in scope and\r\nin use.\r\nThe goal of legitimacy and efficiency for the Security\r\nCouncil not only calls for a higher degree of formalized\r\nrepresentation, but also for increased interaction between\r\nthe members and non-members of the Council. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the improvements undertaken by the\r\nCouncil in the last two years towards better access to\r\ninformation, inter alia in the context of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping, and we ask all of its present and future\r\nmembers to assure an appropriate and consistent follow-up\r\nto these initial steps. These improvements have to be\r\nconsidered a result of the proposals and debates in the\r\nframework of the General Assembly Working Group.\r\nThe increase in access to information ought to be\r\nsupplemented by similar improvements in the possibilities\r\nfor significant interaction between members and\r\nnon-members of the Council. Whenever necessary, the\r\nviews of non-members, especially those immediately\r\nconcerned with questions dealt with in the Council, should\r\nbe heard and their articulation encouraged. Here again we\r\nhave seen progress in recent years, and we hope that this\r\ntrend will continue.\r\nAs a final point, let me stress the importance Austria\r\nattaches to efforts aimed at redressing the political\r\nimbalance between the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. Increased relevance of the General Assembly in\r\nthe decision-making of this Organization is a crucial and\r\nessential element of United Nations reform. This goal\r\nneeds to be pursued with utmost vigour.\r\nTo this effect, the proceedings of the General\r\nAssembly need to be streamlined. We welcome the first\r\nsteps in this direction under the leadership of the\r\nPresident of the Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nBefore calling on the next speaker, I should like to\r\npropose that the list of speakers in the debate on this item\r\nbe closed today at 5 p.m.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I shall take it that the General\r\nAssembly agrees to that proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Eitel (Germany): The President of the General\r\nAssembly will also preside over the deliberations of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council during the fifty-first session. I wish him\r\nand the two Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group,\r\nAmbassador Wilhelm Breitenstein and Ambassador Asda\r\nJayanama, good luck in their difficult task. We are glad\r\nto see the two Vice-Chairmen again on the job.\r\nLet me begin with a metaphor. For almost four years\r\nthe United Nations reform train has been waiting in the\r\nUnited Nations central station on the East River to be\r\nrepaired and overhauled. Passengers outside, in the United\r\nNations country, are waiting for the train to depart and\r\narrive at destinations called Peace and Security,\r\nDevelopment, Human Rights and Environmental\r\nProtection. They are waiting in places that suffer from\r\ninternal conflicts, places still marked by poverty or lack\r\nof democracy and human rights, and places threatened by\r\ndestruction of or serious damage to their environment.\r\nThe United Nations train is the only train in the world\r\nthat can reach those places.\r\nThe train needs competent staff as well as a strong\r\nengine in which Member States have confidence. We\r\nmust therefore replace the old steam locomotive made in\r\n1945 with an up-to-date model engine that pulls the train\r\nforward and is, at the same time, easily controlled and\r\nadapted to the needs of the passengers waiting at the\r\nvarious stations.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nWhere do we stand today in our discussion? And\r\nsecond, where do we go from here?\r\nWith regard to my first question, in the view of\r\nGermany and many other countries, we are ready for\r\nconcrete negotiations on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe latest report of the Working Group of 13 September\r\n1996 includes all the elements necessary for a reform\r\npackage, which are the following.\r\nThe first element is greater transparency in the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council, in particular\r\nbetter information for non-members of the Security Council,\r\nconsultations with present and potential troop-contributing\r\ncountries and the participation of non-members of the\r\nCouncil in its discussions. During its presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council in August 1996, Germany held extensive\r\ndaily briefings and several open formal meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council, allowing a broad flow of information\r\nbetween members and non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil. Statements were also made by an observer country\r\nand an organization with observer status in a public debate\r\nof the Security Council. As President of one of the\r\nSanctions Committees, I gave briefings on its work\r\nthroughout the year.\r\nThe second element is enlargement of both categories\r\nof membership, permanent as well as non-permanent.\r\nDuring the last general debate, many Member States\r\nreferred to Germany as a possible new permanent member.\r\nWe are grateful for this support, and I wish to express my\r\nthanks also to my Ukrainian colleague, who has just\r\n“spoken straight”. Germany continues to stress that a\r\nreform should also provide for permanent membership for\r\nthe South, that is, three seats for Africa, Asia, and Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, all together. Together with new\r\nnon-permanent seats, the overall size of a future Security\r\nCouncil should be between 23 and 26, preferably 24. The\r\nrecent discussions have focused on how to determine who\r\nshould have access to the three new permanent seats for the\r\nSouth. In this context, we have noticed that quite a number\r\nof Member States who have expressed support for the\r\ncreation of new permanent seats have also mentioned the\r\nItalian proposal. This may be understood as a desire to\r\ncombine the principles of permanent regional representation\r\nand rotation, leading to permanent regional rotating seats.\r\nThis is one possible solution to the problem of selecting\r\npermanent members from the three regions I mentioned.\r\nThe third element entails adapting the decision-making\r\nprocedures to the new size and composition of an enlarged\r\nand reformed Security Council. The report of the Working\r\nGroup includes several proposals to this effect which\r\ndeserve our interest and attention. The German position\r\nregarding the so-called action threshold and the veto are\r\nwell known. It is evident, however, that the scope and\r\nconfiguration of these decision-making procedures are\r\ndependent on the political role of the new Security\r\nCouncil. Thus, progress in this area will not only require\r\ncreative thinking and close negotiation but will also be\r\npossible only after the other reform aspects have been\r\nresolved.\r\nThe fourth and last element is a periodic review.\r\nSeveral countries have proposed a re-examination or a\r\nperiodical review of the new composition of the Security\r\nCouncil as part of an overall agreement. Germany, in this\r\ncontext, has presented a proposal for a periodic review\r\nclause (A/50/47, annex XIV), the details of which are\r\nknown to participants. The general purpose of this\r\nproposal is twofold: to guarantee that neither the increase\r\nin membership nor the new composition of the Security\r\nCouncil is irreversible, and thus to facilitate the decision\r\nfor reform now.\r\nThis is where we stand today. Several reform\r\nproposals are on the table. Where do we go from here?\r\nFirst, we must prepare a Security Council reform\r\npackage based on the now existing proposals. After\r\nexcluding the proposals that have been proven to be too\r\nunrealistic or that have provoked only obvious silence on\r\nthe part of the membership, the remaining proposals\r\nshould merge into a reform package on which a general\r\nagreement of the membership can be reached.\r\nSecondly, progress will only be possible by way of\r\nconcrete political negotiation. While the Working Group\r\nwill continue its work, the membership must remain\r\nmindful of the reform mandate and enter into concrete\r\nnegotiations that lead to decisions. These decisions will\r\nhave to be taken according to the provisions and\r\nrequirements for amendments stipulated in the Charter.\r\nAll of us will work for the largest possible majority, but\r\nit would be unrealistic to expect decisions on the basis of\r\na 100 per cent consensus.\r\nThirdly, we must not forget other reform areas. The\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations, the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, the Agenda for Peace and the strengthening\r\nof the United Nations system as a whole are equally at\r\nthe centre of ongoing reform efforts. Germany shares the\r\nview of other countries that the lack of tangible progress\r\nwith regard to the reform of the Security Council\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\n“has an adverse effect on the negotiations on all other\r\naspects of the Organization’s future activities.”\r\n(A/50/47/Add. l, annex XVIII, para. 1)\r\nFourthly, the time to act is now. Let me quote the\r\noutgoing President of the General Assembly and previous\r\nChairman of the Working Group, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral:\r\n“[The] Member States ... now must deliver.... The\r\nissues cannot just be endlessly debated. There must be\r\naction, and there must be action soon.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 128th meeting, p. 7)\r\nThe General Assembly, with its principle of one State,\r\none vote, will have the final word on the composition,\r\ntransparency and effectiveness of the United Nations train\r\ninto the twenty-first century, on its destinations and on its\r\nschedule.\r\nThe passengers have been waiting long enough.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil): I should like to start by\r\nthanking Ambassadors Breitenstein and Jayanama for their\r\ncompetent Vice-Chairmanship during the past year of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, and by placing on record our appreciation\r\nof the leadership provided by Professor Freitas do Amaral\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.\r\nWe are convinced that our current President, Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail, will contribute his well-known dynamism and\r\nlucidity to our future work.\r\nThe Working Group continues to inspire heated\r\ndebates and stimulate profound reflection on an issue that\r\nis central to the future of the Organization. The Working\r\nGroup’s report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth\r\nsession can be described as a satisfactory summary of its\r\nrecent activity, even though, given the rule of consensus, it\r\nunderstandably omits important details and falls short of\r\nreflecting certain trends. It nevertheless stands as a useful\r\ntool to enable work to proceed towards a widely acceptable\r\nblueprint for equitable Council reform.\r\nAs the Brazilian Minister for External Relations, Luiz\r\nFelipe Lampreia, stated in the general debate,\r\n“There is a virtual consensus that the Security Council\r\nshould be enlarged to allow for greater participation\r\nby countries with the capacity to act on a global scale\r\nand the willingness to bear the responsibilities that\r\nwould entail. We must now set a course for this\r\nprocess. Its outcome is essential for strengthening\r\nthe United Nations.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 4th meeting, p. 4)\r\nAt the same time, we share with many a sense of\r\ndisappointment at the General Assembly’s inability to go\r\nfurther than it did during its fiftieth session in setting the\r\nstage for Security Council reform. The United Nations\r\ncannot face the future with confidence as long as the\r\ncomposition of the organ with primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security is not\r\nmade equitable and representative.\r\nReference has been made here to the fact that the\r\nCharter does not speak of equitable geographic\r\ndistribution in dealing with the issue of permanent\r\nmembers. However, if we consider the work of those who\r\nwrote the Charter in 1945, we must conclude that they\r\nalso had in mind the idea of equitable geographic\r\ndistribution. Since most of Africa was at that time still\r\nunder colonial rule, Latin America was the only region\r\nthat was excluded — the result of a specific fact to which\r\nI may refer on another occasion.\r\nWe must be wary of the risks involved in failing to\r\nact. But we must be even more careful not to mistake the\r\nneed for equitable representation in an expanded Security\r\nCouncil with forms of expansion that will make it neither\r\nrepresentative nor equitable and that, instead of taking us\r\ncloser to those objectives, may, on the contrary, lead us\r\nin the opposite direction.\r\nThe Working Group has already reached the\r\nconclusion that\r\n“In the event that there is agreement for an increase\r\nin the permanent membership, an increase only by\r\nindustrialized countries would be widely regarded as\r\nunacceptable”. (A/50/47, para. 26)\r\nHowever, despite the fact that this conclusion may be\r\ntaken as a welcome sign of wisdom, other ideas are still\r\nlurking in the background — sometimes even in the\r\nforeground — which, though disguised, would have the\r\nsame practical effect of aggravating the existing\r\nimbalance.\r\nProlonged discussions in the Working Group\r\nexposed the inherent flaws in proposals that conceived of\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\na regional process for the selection of permanent members\r\nfrom some quarters while exempting two industrialized\r\ncountries from the same type of selection procedure. The\r\nattempted justification for such ideas remains unconvincing.\r\nIt is said, for example, that there seems to be a lack of\r\nagreement in three regions with regard to who should\r\noccupy the corresponding permanent seats. Nothing is said\r\nof the regional situation of the two particular industrialized\r\ncountries, although some of the strongest opposition to the\r\nidea of permanent membership is to be found precisely in\r\ntheir parts of the world.\r\nIn our view, the concept of “equitable representation”\r\ncertainly encompasses the idea of equitable geographic or\r\nregional representation. However, it also has other\r\nconnotations. A body of such limited composition and\r\nwide-ranging powers as the Security Council must be\r\nperceived as legitimate, and for that to be the case it must\r\ninclude, as permanent members, a sample of Member States\r\nthat is broadly seen as representative of different\r\nperspectives.\r\nWe believe that the regional component must be kept\r\nin mind in any plan for reform, but not as a pretext for\r\nestablishing inequities at the outset of the reform process,\r\nin contravention of our very mandate. The selective\r\napplication of regional procedures for identifying new\r\npermanent members, to which I have just referred, is a case\r\nin point.\r\nLogically, the so-called regional permanent seat —\r\nwhether as its rotating variant or in some other guise —\r\nmight have an operational meaning in parts of the world\r\nwhere integration in the fields of foreign policy and defence\r\nhas advanced substantially. However, if the one region of\r\nthe world where this is already happening does not feel\r\nready to embrace the regional permanent seat for itself, it\r\nis doubtful whether there is a legitimate basis for\r\nencouraging others to do so.\r\nFurthermore, care should be taken not to confound the\r\ninformal regional groupings of the United Nations system\r\nwith regional bodies in the field of international affairs. Let\r\nus not forget that the establishment of a common foreign or\r\nsecurity policy only comes about, if at all, as one of the last\r\nstages in any process of regional integration. Perhaps we\r\nwill head towards an interregional world with a higher\r\nstandard of understanding among Governments and peoples\r\nin the future; that is certainly desirable. If — or when —\r\nthat happens, a revision of the basis for representation in\r\nthe Security Council would be in order. However, for the\r\ntime being, the truth is that we still live and work in an\r\ninter-State world — at least as far as cooperation for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security is concerned. The\r\ncurrent permanent members of the Security Council have\r\ngiven no indication whatsoever that they think otherwise.\r\nIt is impossible to discuss last year’s report without\r\ntaking due note of the wide support expressed in the\r\nWorking Group for proposals to limit the scope and use\r\nof the veto. We sympathize with many such proposals, in\r\nparticular those submitted by countries of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, and with the interesting\r\nsuggestions by the delegations of Uruguay and Mexico\r\nreferred to in paragraph 31 of document A/50/47. At the\r\nsame time, we recognize that these proposals have met\r\nwith some resistance, in particular on the part of the\r\nexisting permanent members.\r\nIn Working Group discussions I alluded to an idea\r\nthat I believe could help to discourage resort to the veto\r\nwithout abridging the current rights of permanent\r\nmembers. This would allow permanent members to cast\r\nnegative votes in the same way as non-permanent\r\nmembers cast them: without blocking decisions. Were the\r\nCouncil’s permanent members granted such a faculty, it\r\nwould offer new possibilities for self-restraint, not by\r\nlimiting their prerogatives but by giving them an\r\nadditional option that, strictly speaking, they do not enjoy.\r\nThey would still be entitled to vote in favour of or to\r\nabstain on a resolution, or to veto it. But in addition, they\r\nwould be entitled to vote against without vetoing, in the\r\nsame way as the non-permanent members have done for\r\nmore than 50 years. It would be like allowing someone\r\nwho is used to being chauffeur-driven around town in a\r\ncomfortable private limousine the right to use public\r\ntransportation. It could not do any harm, and would\r\nprobably have some constructive repercussions. This idea\r\nis certainly not a panacea, and does not address all\r\nconcerns, but it may be worth considering.\r\nTo my delegation, as well as to many others\r\ninvolved in the deliberations of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup, the democratization of the United Nations stands\r\nout as a priority. If the Security Council is to shape a\r\npeaceful world order capable of honouring the principles\r\nof the Charter, its decisions must be perceived as legally\r\nsound and politically wise. Its work must meet the\r\nrequired standards of accountability expected of\r\ngovernmental institutions in democratic regimes. The\r\nglobal responsibilities entrusted to the permanent and non-\r\npermanent members of the Council cannot be subject to\r\nnarrow-mindedness.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nThese considerations apply to all the Council’s\r\nactivities, but acquire greater significance with respect to\r\nthe authorization of coercive measures, even when they do\r\nnot involve the use of force. The political nature of the\r\nCouncil’s work does not entitle it to treat considerations of\r\na legal nature with laxity. The need for urgent action cannot\r\njustify persistent improvisation. The time has perhaps come\r\nfor a critical assessment of Council action since the end of\r\nthe cold war, with a view to identifying the cases where\r\ndecisions did not contribute to preserving the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations, as well as to looking at alternative\r\napproaches capable not only of preserving but, if possible,\r\nenhancing the Organization’s image as an impartial broker\r\nfor peace. In this context, discussions such as the ones\r\npursued in the General Assembly on the Supplement to “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” can be considered a healthy exercise to\r\nbe further stimulated.\r\nThe President of the International Court of Justice,\r\nJudge Mohammed Bedjaoui, has made an important\r\ncontribution in this regard, in his book entitled The New\r\nWorld Order and the Security Council: Testing the Legality\r\nof its Acts. We concur in particular with his prescription for\r\nfuture Council activity when he states that:\r\n“The task is to subject the use of force to ever more\r\nrigorous discipline, to confirm and develop the rules\r\nwhich fortify just recourse to it, to eliminate the\r\npractices which lead it astray and to endow such\r\nrecourse with the respect and recognition it inevitably\r\narouses when it serves to found order upon justice.”\r\n(The New World Order and the Security Council:\r\nTesting the Legality of its Acts, Martinus Nijhoff\r\nPublishers, 1995, page 6)\r\nWe need an Organization with a balanced and solid\r\ninstitutional architecture. The relationship between the\r\nGeneral Assembly, a restructured Security Council and a\r\nrevitalized Economic and Social Council is of fundamental\r\nimportance as we become increasingly aware of the\r\nmutually reinforcing interlinkage between peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy in all its aspects. The\r\nInternational Court of Justice is also an essential part of our\r\nedifice. A number of questions related to peace and security\r\ndo not fit exclusively within the Security Council’s area of\r\ncompetence. They can be treated either elsewhere or in\r\ncooperation with other organs. The General Assembly, in\r\nparticular, should be in close touch with the Council’s\r\nactivity. As a small step in that direction, I would suggest\r\nthat the President of the General Assembly be invited to\r\nparticipate in the monthly luncheon given by the President\r\nof the Security Council for the Permanent Representatives\r\nof Council members along with the Secretary-General.\r\nIn an article published last month, Mr. Paul\r\nKennedy, a British historian working at Yale University\r\ncommented that:\r\n“The end of the cold war has made much of world\r\npolitics unfamiliar, messy and difficult to assess”.\r\nBut he also argued that the challenges facing the\r\nworld today are not really greater than those confronting\r\nworld leaders in the chaos of 1945. He concluded that the\r\nworld is in need of leadership and that world leaders\r\nshould have the foresight to make the Security Council\r\nrepresentative. His article only provides us with one more\r\nincentive to continue to participate actively in the\r\npromotion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council, as an\r\nindispensable element in the effort to strengthen\r\nmultilateralism as part of our larger endeavour to build a\r\nUnited Nations capable of facing the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): Allow me to start with a brief\r\nsketch of where we stand after three years of deliberations\r\non the question of the expansion of the Security Council.\r\nFirst of all, there will be no quick fix. Everyone,\r\nincluding its potential beneficiaries, agrees that the quick\r\nfix has no future. As for the “2+3” proposal, it would be\r\nextremely difficult if not impossible to select one African,\r\none Asian, and one Latin American or Caribbean country\r\nfor a permanent seat. Moreover, one of the permanent\r\nmembers has already made it abundantly clear that it\r\nwould block any Charter amendment granting the veto to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThis leaves us with three main options: first, the\r\n“2+3 regional permanent rotating seats” and its variants;\r\nsecondly, the Italian proposal to establish 10 new\r\nnon-permanent seats for the more frequent rotation of 30\r\ncountries to be chosen by the General Assembly; and\r\nthirdly, the fall-back position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement to increase only non-permanent seats, for the\r\ntime being, in case no agreement is reached on other\r\ncategories of membership. Let us look at these options\r\none by one.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nThe first formula, “2+3 regional permanent rotating\r\nseats” ran into some lively opposition when it was\r\ndiscussed last spring in the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nSome representatives dubbed it a quick fix by the back\r\ndoor. To me, it looked like a Trojan horse: open it up, and\r\nout jump two new permanent members, Germany and\r\nJapan. We were also brought back to our logical senses on\r\nthis particular point by our Brazilian colleague, who spoke\r\nbefore me, when he reminded us that we are the United\r\nNations, not the “United Regions”.\r\nWe thought that the sun had set on this proposal, but\r\nto our surprise it was reincarnated this September in the\r\nform of a draft resolution circulated to an Asian capital and\r\nthrough the corridors of the United Nations. This latest\r\nversion carries the proviso that it would be up to the three\r\ncontinents, Africa, Asia and Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, to decide how often, how many and which of\r\ntheir respective countries would be the beneficiaries of\r\nthese regional permanent rotating seats. In fact, this text\r\nwould immediately grant permanent seats to two large\r\nindustrialized countries. The under-represented continents,\r\nmeanwhile, would be led into an endless, intractable dispute\r\nover the criteria and modalities for utilizing the seats\r\nassigned to them — assigned only on paper, of course.\r\nFrankly, we do not see how such a plan can be accepted.\r\nNo one — I repeat, no one — is so naive as to buy a\r\ncompromise that would give immediate advantages to two\r\ncountries and only a long-term credit to their counterparts.\r\nFurthermore as was just mentioned the establishment of\r\nregional permanent rotating seats would introduce two\r\ndouble standards at the United Nations. The first would\r\naffect two regional groups — the Western European and\r\nOther States, and the Eastern Europe States — which would\r\nbe excluded from the rotation. The second double standard\r\nwould affect all of us, since the hypothetical global\r\nsuperiority of certain countries would be treated as a\r\nforegone conclusion. But then where do we draw the line\r\nbetween countries that are economic global Powers and\r\ncountries that are not?\r\nLet us face another fact of life. Veto power will not be\r\ngranted to two self-appointed “global Powers” unless it is\r\nsimultaneously accorded to developing countries — a\r\npossibility that has, as I said earlier, been ruled out by one\r\npermanent member. Therefore, should this scenario prevail,\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations would be divided\r\ninto four categories: category A, the five current permanent\r\nmembers, with veto power; category B, two new permanent\r\nmembers, Germany and Japan, but without veto power, at\r\nleast for the time being; category C, a certain number of\r\ncountries, depending on how many are eventually chosen\r\nfrom the three developing continents — also without the\r\nveto, of course — that would occupy the three regional\r\npermanent seats on a rotating basis and probably forgo\r\nthe test of democratic elections; and category D — all the\r\nrest of us, who would have to continue to compete\r\nfiercely for the non-permanent seats, which would\r\nincrease in number only slightly. I refer here to 165 or\r\n170 countries, large and small, major and minor\r\ncontributors to the budget, active participants and\r\nnon-participants in peacekeeping operations, and so on.\r\nAs I said, the United Nations would end up with four\r\ncategories of membership. Now what kind of equality is\r\nthat?\r\nMany of us have already noted that the expression\r\n“permanent rotating”, semantically speaking, is a\r\ncontradiction in terms. If a seat is permanent, it does not\r\nrotate. If it rotates, it is not permanent. Yet the authors of\r\nthis terminology have touted it as “constructive\r\nambiguity”. With all due respect, it sounds to us more\r\nlike “destructive ambiguity”. It would destroy democracy,\r\nsince it would violate the principle of sovereign equality\r\nenshrined in our Charter. It would destroy justice, making\r\nthe Security Council even more elitist than it is now. It\r\nwould curtail one of the General Assembly’s main\r\npowers: the right to democratically elect by secret ballot\r\nand by a two-thirds majority no fewer than two thirds of\r\nthe Security Council members — 10 out of the present\r\n15.\r\nLet us learn from history; in 1926, the decline of the\r\nLeague of Nations was set into motion, at least in part, by\r\nan increase in its permanent membership.\r\nTurning now to the second option — the Italian\r\nproposal — I should like first sincerely to thank the\r\ncountries that have manifested their interest or support.\r\nWe are heartened by the growing momentum that is\r\nbuilding behind it. During the recent general debate, 29\r\ncountries expressly mentioned the Italian proposal, many\r\nof them for the first time. That number is on a par with\r\nthe number of delegations that mentioned granting\r\npermanent seats to Germany and Japan. All in all, since\r\nthe beginning of the exercise on Security Council reform,\r\n77 — I repeat, 77 — countries have publicly supported\r\nthe Italian formula or shown interest in it per se or as a\r\nfall-back position.\r\nThe Italian proposal addresses and reconciles the two\r\nmajor changes that have occurred on the international\r\nscene since the end of the Second World War: first, the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nemergence of a group of countries with considerable\r\neconomic and political capacities, including Italy, which by\r\n1 January 1998 will be the fifth largest contributor to the\r\nUnited Nations budget; and secondly, the emergence of the\r\ndeveloping countries, which are far more numerous and\r\nimportant today than they were in 1965, when the Security\r\nCouncil was enlarged.\r\nIt is a fact that over the past 50 years, several\r\nmedium- to large-sized countries have been elected to the\r\nCouncil more frequently than others. It is also a fact that 77\r\ncountries, including some founding Members, have\r\nnever — never — been elected to the Council, while 44\r\nhave been elected only once; in other words, for two thirds\r\nof the general membership, participation in the Security\r\nCouncil has either been completely blocked or severely\r\nlimited. Under the Italian proposal, these States would have\r\na far more concrete chance of being elected to the Security\r\nCouncil, since they would be shielded from the competition\r\nof the “big brothers” in their respective regional groups. As\r\nfor the medium- to large-sized countries, whose rivalry for\r\nseats has, as we witnessed last week, grown more heated\r\nand divisive with each passing year, our proposal aims to\r\nbring more harmony and less bitterness to the elections.\r\nLast but not least, the Italian proposal aims to\r\nstrengthen the role of the General Assembly, which is and\r\nmust remain the bedrock of our Organization. Since all\r\nnon-permanent members, whether frequently or regularly\r\nrotating, would have to stand for democratic election, the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s power within the United Nations\r\nsystem would be maintained and even strengthened.\r\nAs to the impact of Security Council reform on the\r\nfinancial situation, time and again we have heard that the\r\nreward for handing over two permanent seats to two great\r\neconomic Powers would be an influx of fresh cash into\r\nUnited Nations coffers. However, the financial situation\r\ncould also be improved through the Italian proposal, and\r\nnot at the immense cost of granting perpetual, irreversible\r\nseats to two nations.\r\nConsider the financing of peacekeeping operations.\r\nCurrently the permanent members pay the same share for\r\npeacekeeping as they do for the regular budget, plus a\r\nsurcharge of approximately 20 per cent. One argument that\r\nhas been made in favour of granting permanent seats to\r\nGermany and Japan is that their payment of such a\r\nsurcharge would increase the resources available to the\r\npeacekeeping budget. But the Italian proposal has a notable\r\nadvantage in this respect. It would distribute the burden\r\namong a larger number of countries — 30 rather than 2 —\r\nsince more frequently rotating States would also have to\r\npay a surcharge of 10 per cent, half the ratio paid by\r\npermanent members. This would also decrease the\r\nOrganization’s dependence on the contributions and on\r\nthe whims of two or three countries, and help to reduce\r\nthe contribution of the less-developed countries. In the\r\nlong term it might even lead to a reassessment of the\r\nsurcharge paid by permanent members.\r\nThe third proposal on the table is the fall-back\r\nposition of the Non-Aligned Movement:\r\n“If there is no agreement on other categories of\r\nmembership, expansion should take place only, for\r\nthe time being, in the non-permanent category.”\r\n(A/49/965, annex 9, para. 5)\r\nThis proposal follows in the footsteps of the first, and so\r\nfar only, successful reform of the Security Council in\r\n1965, when four non-permanent seats were added. I have\r\na very simple question: If it worked then, why should it\r\nnot work now?\r\nRecent voting results have led to speculation that the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement is losing its traditional unity and\r\nclout. In my opinion, this is a serious miscalculation.\r\nThose of us who were invited to Cartagena witnessed the\r\nimpressive solidarity of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\ncountries on general and specific issues. The Non-Aligned\r\nMovement fall-back position for the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council can count on a large base: 113 members\r\nin the General Assembly — almost the exact majority\r\nneeded to approve a proposal for an amendment to the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nItaly remains convinced of the validity of its own\r\nproposal; but, as Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said to\r\nthe General Assembly one month ago, we are also\r\nprepared to accept another formula that would be\r\nconsistent with the fundamental principles of our\r\nproposal — the principles of democracy, equitable\r\ngeographic representation, effectiveness, efficiency and\r\ntransparency. We remain firmly opposed to the granting\r\nof new permanent seats in any way, style or form.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement position is animated by\r\nthe same spirit as the Italian proposal and has a similar\r\norientation. It could represent a first step towards future\r\nsolutions, while instantly making available additional\r\nelective seats, for which all of us could freely compete.\r\nThe new seats should be allotted to every regional group.\r\nIt should not be hard to reach an agreement on the exact\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nnumber, since we all want a manageable, effective and\r\nefficient Security Council.\r\nAs to the amendment procedure, we would simply\r\nhave to follow in the footsteps of the 1963 enlargement,\r\nwhen only two small amendments to the Charter were\r\nnecessary: one on the number of non-permanent seats, the\r\nother on the new majority needed to adopt a resolution.\r\nAfter three years of intensive work, our inability to\r\nreach an agreement on the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil could damage the image of our Organization, and\r\nthis at a time when the United Nations is already being\r\ncriticized. But we simply cannot, and should not, accept the\r\nstatus quo. That is why we must proceed, with full respect\r\nfor the principles of openness and transparency. In this\r\nendeavour our best guarantee for success is, first and\r\nforemost, the objectivity and impartiality of our new\r\nPresident, Mr. Razali Ismail, as well as his determination\r\nand experience.\r\nWe are at a fork in the road. One path leads to new\r\npermanent seats, the other to new elective seats. One brings\r\nus back to more discrimination, elitism and inequity. The\r\nother takes us forward to greater democracy, participation\r\nand justice. It is up to us, and us alone, to decide; but\r\nwhether we like it or not, even as we speak the future is\r\ncharting the course we must follow. One hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago, that great political scientist, Alexis de\r\nTocqueville, wrote that democracy, which shuts the past\r\nagainst us, opens the future before us.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): In recent years, the General\r\nAssembly, through the Open-ended Working Group, has\r\nworked with renewed intensity towards a Security Council\r\nrestructured both in form and content. The challenge of\r\nchange must be met, even if a comprehensive solution has\r\nnot so far been found. This session is critical in our\r\ncollective efforts to find the answer.\r\nAfter three years of intensive deliberations, no\r\nconcrete progress has been made. Nonetheless, the global\r\nmomentum towards reform must be maintained and\r\nenhanced. The tireless efforts of the three consecutive\r\nChairmen of the Open-ended Working Group and the\r\nco-Vice-Chairmen therefore deserve our full appreciation.\r\nThere is universal acknowledgement, both within the\r\nAssembly and outside it, that the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should be expanded and its working\r\nmethods, including the use of the veto, modified and\r\nchanged. Failure to do so will undermine the legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council. The Council can no\r\nlonger be viewed through the prism of the victors of the\r\nSecond World War. It cannot ignore the fact that, today,\r\nit is answerable to 185 Member States and not just 51, as\r\nit was at the inception of the Organization.\r\nExpansion must take account of the legitimate\r\ninterests of Member States, especially of those that are\r\ndisadvantaged. The Council cannot remain nor become\r\nthe permanent abode exclusively of the rich and powerful.\r\nMalaysia maintains that expansion should take place\r\nin both categories of Council membership — permanent\r\nand non-permanent. Given the increasingly important role\r\nof regionalism in inter-State relations, as well as its\r\nrecognition in the Charter itself, Malaysia and a number\r\nof other countries have advocated the concept of\r\npermanent regional representation. Let me restate here\r\nthat that concept attempts to reflect today’s reality and to\r\ntake advantage of the diverse and accelerating\r\ndevelopments that have helped boost confidence among\r\nthe countries of the regions. Furthermore, the role of\r\nregionalism in global peace, security and development has\r\nblossomed. Permanent representation of a region on the\r\nSecurity Council, based on a mechanism to be worked out\r\nand agreed upon by members of that particular region,\r\nshould become an alternative to what is essentially the nineteenth-\r\ncentury model of great-Power politics that has\r\ndetermined the present structure and composition of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nInstead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam\r\nwith no solution in sight, the concept of permanent\r\nregional representation offers a practical alternative and a\r\nviable model for the future structure of the Security\r\nCouncil. The concept essentially seeks to address the need\r\nfor equitable and balanced geographical representation\r\nwherein permanent seats are allocated to each of the\r\ndeveloping regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean and not to individual countries. Under that\r\nconcept, the industrialized countries are conceived of as\r\nan identifiable region. The regional representatives,\r\nselected by their respective regions on the basis of criteria\r\nconsistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter,\r\nshall exercise all the rights enjoyed by the other\r\npermanent members.\r\nThe African Group has proposed two permanent\r\nseats for Africa. If the other two developing regions and\r\nthe industrialized groups are given two seats each, there\r\nwould be an additional eight permanent seats. The\r\nincrease in permanent seats must be complemented by an\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nexpansion in the number of non-permanent seats, especially\r\nfor regions that currently do not have sufficient\r\nmembership. This would make a Council of 27 members,\r\nwhich is relatively small in comparison to the whole of the\r\nmembership of the Organization today. Such a composition\r\ntakes into account the need for the Council to function\r\neffectively and in an efficient manner. The concept of\r\npermanent regional representation, as well as others put\r\nforward along similar lines, such as the African common\r\nposition and permanent regional rotating seats, should not\r\nbe set aside but should rather be treated with the\r\nseriousness that they deserve.\r\nThe continued existence of the veto in the Security\r\nCouncil has made that body, whose decisions have global\r\nreach and implications, a blatant instrument of the foreign\r\npolicies of the permanent members. Instead of safeguarding\r\nthe global interests of peace and security, the use of the\r\nveto or the threat of its use can only serve to promote the\r\nnational agendas of the individual permanent members. As\r\na result, the basic needs and interests of the general\r\nmembership are often compromised. While explicit exercise\r\nof the veto has declined since the end of the cold war, the\r\nthreat of its use has often been exploited by the permanent\r\nmembers, thereby creating imbalances in the decisions and\r\nactions of the Council. Furthermore, the veto negates the\r\nprinciples of democracy and the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, and its use, as has often been proved in the past,\r\nprevents the Council from fulfilling the will of the\r\ninternational community. For these reasons, Malaysia has\r\nconsistently declared that the veto power in the Security\r\nCouncil is undemocratic and anachronistic and we have\r\nconsistently called for its abolition.\r\nWhile recognizing the difficulties, and the reality that\r\nthe permanent members would not give up their privilege\r\nof absolute power in the Council, we believe that, at the\r\nleast, the use of the veto should be rationalized and the\r\npresent voting system in the Council modified. A\r\nmechanism should therefore be established that would\r\nensure that a single veto could not prohibit the majority in\r\nthe Council from making a decision or pronouncement. Its\r\nscope should be restricted solely to enforcement measures\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. A proposal on the\r\nquestion of the veto has been put forward by the Movement\r\nof Non-Aligned Countries and is contained in annex VII of\r\ndocument A/50/47/Add.1 of 9 September 1996. Enough has\r\nbeen said during our deliberations on this question over the\r\npast three years. Our only hope now is to see the permanent\r\nmembers recognize the fact and be more forthcoming\r\ninstead of continuing to adopt a dogmatic approach. Only\r\nthen could substantive progress in all aspects of Council\r\nreform be made.\r\nSimilarly, adequate suggestions have been put\r\nforward by various delegations with regard to the question\r\ndealing with the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. Those suggestions were not made for the sake of\r\nmaking comments or throwing unnecessary criticism at\r\nthe Council, but were aimed at ensuring the transparency,\r\naccountability and legitimacy of that body. My delegation\r\nfully subscribes to the proposals made by the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement as contained in General\r\nAssembly document A/49/965 of 18 September 1995. The\r\neffective functioning of the United Nations could be\r\nfurther enhanced through improved networking between\r\nits principal organs. The relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the general membership of the United\r\nNations in the General Assembly could be enhanced\r\nthrough regular consultations between their respective\r\nPresidents or through wide consultations with concerned\r\nparties, including regional organizations.\r\nThese proposals were developed further by other\r\ndelegations in the course of the Working Group’s\r\ndeliberations at the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe cannot deny that some measures have been adopted\r\nby the Security Council, but they should not be tentative\r\nor provisional. Instead, they should be further enhanced\r\nand institutionalized.\r\nIn my delegation’s assessment, the questions of\r\ndecision-making, in particular the veto and that of the\r\nworking methods of the Council, are the areas that could\r\nbe resolved without a need for any further deliberations.\r\nNumerous proposals have been made, but it is clear to my\r\ndelegation that they will not lead to any conclusion unless\r\nthere is both flexibility and political will on the part of\r\nthe permanent members.\r\nAnother related aspect of the Council reform pertains\r\nto the so-called “cascade effect”. Even in the absence of\r\nCharter provisions, the five permanent members of the\r\nCouncil have been permanent members in other principal\r\norgans of the United Nations. My delegation cannot find\r\nany basis for such automatic membership. It is certainly\r\nnot the right or prerogative of the five, as they have\r\nclaimed. In keeping with the democratization of the\r\nUnited Nations systems and in upholding the principle of\r\nthe sovereign equality of States, the automatic\r\nmembership of the permanent members of the Council in\r\nother organs or bodies of the United Nations should be\r\nreviewed as soon as possible. The permanent members’\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nautomatic elections to those organs should not be taken for\r\ngranted and, in other organs of this Organization where\r\nthey serve, they must share the responsibilities of\r\nmembership and not insist on membership while refusing to\r\ndischarge their responsibilities.\r\nFinally, my delegation wishes to acknowledge the\r\nimportance of the ideas and inputs that non-governmental\r\norganizations and academic society can contribute to the\r\nwork of the Working Group. Their involvement would\r\nbenefit our work as we move forward to resolve this\r\nimportant matter. Such involvement would, of course, be\r\nwithout prejudice to the whole issue, which we believe\r\nshould be finally determined by the intergovernmental\r\nprocesses. We do hope that the Working Group will devote\r\nsome meetings to hearing the views and receiving the\r\ninputs of these groups, which are rich in ideas on the\r\nreform the Council.\r\nMr. Wlosowicz (Poland): The international\r\ncommunity today seems to have no doubt as to the need to\r\nreform the Security Council. There is widespread agreement\r\nthat this reform should be instituted in order to respond\r\nadequately to the dramatic changes in international\r\nrelations. Its principal aim should be to enhance the ability\r\nof the Security Council to fulfil its main responsibility\r\nunder the Charter: to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAt its forty-eighth session, the General Assembly\r\ndecided to establish an Open-ended Working Group to\r\nconsider the questions related to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Although the results of the Group’s work so far\r\nhave fallen short of the cherished expectations of the\r\nmajority of United Nations Members, it must be noted that\r\nconsiderable progress has been made on some aspects of\r\nthe subject with which this body was charged. For the first\r\ntime, the Working Group managed to produce a\r\ncomprehensive report which covers the whole spectrum of\r\nissues related to the Security Council. It is a clear\r\nindication that discussions on the reform of the Council by\r\nthe Working Group went beyond the presentation by United\r\nNations Member States of their general positions and\r\nreached a new stage: the in-depth analysis of proposed\r\nsolutions.\r\nThe deliberations of the Working Group have also had\r\nan impact upon the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. In this regard, we note that non-members’ access\r\nto information about the proceedings of the Security\r\nCouncil has been improved through, among other things,\r\nregular briefings by the Council’s President. It is worth\r\nnoting as well that the recent and increasingly frequent\r\npractice of convening open orientation debates of the\r\nSecurity Council with the participation of interested States\r\nnot only has enhanced the transparency of the Council’s\r\nproceedings; but has also helped the United Nations\r\nMembers in general to express their views on the issues\r\nunder consideration by the Council. Transparency has also\r\nbeen enhanced in the field of peacekeeping operations\r\nfollowing the statement made by the Council President on\r\n28 March 1996 concerning the amendments to the\r\nprocedures of meetings of troop-contributing countries.\r\nMy delegation was one of those which proposed these\r\nchanges.\r\nYet in spite of the progress already accomplished by\r\nthe Working Group, a considerable divergence of views,\r\neven on the most important aspects of Security Council\r\nreform, still lingers among Member States and the\r\nprospects for compromise are still fairly remote. For this\r\nreason, we are convinced that the most important task\r\nbefore Member States is an arduous attempt to surmount\r\ntheir differences. We believe that, at present, the Working\r\nGroup should focus on the search for compromise\r\nsolutions, however difficult this search might prove. With\r\nthis in mind we note that we would pleased to see the\r\nmandate of the Working Group extended.\r\nPoland is ready to make its contribution to the\r\nsearch for mutually acceptable solutions. We believe that,\r\nat this critical juncture, it is imperative to display\r\nmaximum flexibility and readiness for compromise. For\r\nour part, we have carefully analyzed our position in the\r\nlight of the views expressed so far in the discussions and\r\nwe will soon present our considerations in the form of an\r\ninformal position paper, which will elaborate on our\r\npreviously presented views concerning the most important\r\naspects of the Security Council’s future, including one of\r\nthe most difficult among them: the issue of the size of the\r\nCouncil and the allocation of newly created seats.\r\nAt this stage I would like to focus on one point. We\r\nbelieve that the solution concerning the size of the\r\nCouncil is to expand it to between 21 and 25 members.\r\nWhile we are most favourably considering various ideas\r\nconcerning increased representation for other regional\r\ngroups, we have to state quite clearly that any\r\nenlargement of the Security Council should also result in\r\naugmented representation for Eastern Europe, a region in\r\nwhich the number of States has more than doubled in\r\nrecent years. We cannot go along with any formula which\r\nwould, directly or indirectly, imply a discriminatory\r\nstance towards the Eastern European Group and in which\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nall other regions would get a share in the extension. Having\r\nalready endorsed the entirely justified aspirations of\r\nGermany and Japan to permanent membership in the\r\nSecurity Council, we also support an enhanced\r\nrepresentation of the developing countries of Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America in both categories of membership of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nI would like to return for a moment to the important\r\nissue of improving the Security Council’s working methods.\r\nAlthough in the earlier part of my statement I pointed to\r\nsome progress that has been made in this field, it seems\r\nevident to my delegation that a lot still remains to be done\r\nand that efforts should be continued, especially with regard\r\nto transparency and the availability of information about the\r\nwork of the Security Council to the membership at large.\r\nJudging by our experience as a non-permanent member of\r\nthe Security Council, we are of the view that discussion of\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council, in addition to\r\nemphasizing improvements to the link between the Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations general membership, should\r\nfocus on, among other things, further developing the\r\ncooperative character of the Security Council’s proceedings\r\nand the process of executing its decisions. It should also\r\nfocus on more harmonious cooperation between the\r\nCouncil — as the body carrying primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security — and\r\nthe regional arrangements referred to in Article 52 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe believe that improvements in the working methods\r\nshould constitute a continuous task for the Council. They\r\ncan be implemented, as was the case in the past, without\r\nnecessarily waiting for the formal completion of the\r\nWorking Group’s work.\r\nIn conclusion, let me again stress the importance we\r\nattach to the reform of the Security Council. We believe\r\nthat this reform is one of the central elements in the effort\r\nto strengthen and reinvigorate the entire system of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): For\r\nthe third consecutive year, the General Assembly has before\r\nit a report of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council established by resolution\r\n48/26.\r\nIn the recent general debate, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of my country, Angel Gurría Treviño, stated:\r\n“Mexico considers it essential that in evaluating\r\nthe proposals before us, account should be taken of\r\nthe need for that organ’s composition to reflect the\r\nincrease in the membership of the Organization,\r\nwhile strictly respecting the wishes of the countries\r\nof each region and the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution”. (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 13th meeting, p. 15)\r\nThe report we are now examining is a faithful\r\nreflection of what took place in the Group, and makes it\r\nclear that, despite the general conviction of the need to\r\nenlarge the Security Council, major differences still\r\nseparate us on fundamental issues. I intend to focus on\r\nthe very limited areas of convergence that exist,\r\nparticularly with respect to the composition of the future\r\nCouncil and the need to limit the scope and exercise of\r\nthe right of veto.\r\nIn the first place, in paragraph 26 of its report the\r\nWorking Group rejected what is known as the “quick\r\nfix”, which involves admitting as permanent members\r\nonly the two developed countries that have so requested\r\ninsistently. With this affirmation, the most discriminatory\r\nformula among all those that have been put forward has\r\nbeen discarded. In addition, paragraph 29 of the report\r\nspecifically refers to the proposal of the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries to the effect that:\r\n“in case of no agreement on the increase of other\r\ncategories of membership, expansion should take\r\nplace only, for the time being, in the non-permanent\r\ncategory”. (A/50/47, para. 29)\r\nLet us not forget that this position reflects the view of a\r\nvery significant group of countries, almost two-thirds of\r\nthe Members of the United Nations.\r\nLastly, paragraph 31 of the report reflects the\r\nwidespread support for the idea of limiting the right of\r\nveto, an excessive privilege enjoyed by the five\r\npermanent members. It should come as no surprise, and\r\nindeed did not surprise us, that the only strong opposition\r\nto changing this situation has come from precisely those\r\nfive countries.\r\nAs will be recalled, we began the discussions in the\r\nWorking Group with great enthusiasm in January 1994.\r\nWe thought at that time that the international community\r\nwas in a position to design a Security Council that would\r\nreflect the circumstances of today’s world, so different\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nfrom those in which it was created in 1945. We set\r\nourselves the goal of strengthening the functioning of the\r\norgan to which we, the States Members of the United\r\nNations, have delegated the delicate responsibility of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. We recognized\r\nthat the task of reforming the Security Council should be\r\nbased on the principle of sovereign equality of Members of\r\nthe United Nations, on equitable geographical distribution\r\nand on contribution to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. We also reiterated at that time the need\r\nto transform the Council into a more transparent, more\r\nrepresentative, more legitimate and more efficient\r\ninstrument, capable of facing the new challenges.\r\nWe considered that the end of the cold war offered a\r\nunique opportunity to correct defects and imbalances in the\r\ncomposition and working methods of the Security Council.\r\nReality very quickly frustrated our hopes for genuine\r\nreform. We saw with great disappointment that, contrary to\r\nthe original spirit, there were some who had the intention,\r\nprecisely, of accentuating the inequalities and extending the\r\nprivileges to others.\r\nThe discussions in the Working Group were\r\ndeadlocked practically from the outset by the claims of a\r\nsmall number of countries which, on the basis of reasons\r\nthat were never convincing, requested admission to the\r\nprivileged group.\r\nAs is well known, Mexico sees no justification\r\nwhatsoever for increasing the number of permanent\r\nmembers. We have said, and we repeat it here now, that the\r\nfive we currently have are more than enough.\r\nWe do not understand how at the same time as the\r\nvalidity of the fundamental principle of sovereign equality\r\nembodied in the Charter is being reiterated, efforts are\r\nbeing made to increase the number of countries enjoying\r\nspecial rights and privileges.\r\nHow can we speak of the need to take equitable\r\ngeographical distribution into account if, as a result of the\r\nexercise, we are faced with a Council in which a single\r\ngeographical group would have four permanent members?\r\nHow can we believe that the Council’s effectiveness would\r\nbe increased by giving more countries the power to prevent\r\nthe adoption of its decisions?\r\nWe all know that the composition and working\r\nmethods of the Security Council are not an example of\r\ndemocracy. How then can we pretend to correct this\r\nshortcoming by increasing the number of its permanent\r\nmembers?\r\nThe political realities of 1945, we must not forget,\r\ncompelled us to accept that five of the founding Members\r\nof the United Nations should enjoy exceptional privileges,\r\nthus constituting an exception to one of the cornerstones\r\non which our Organization rests. We do not believe that\r\nthe contradiction should be repeated now by increasing\r\nthe number of those who are beyond the general rule.\r\nLike other countries, Mexico submitted a proposal\r\nthat could help to move the negotiations forward. With\r\nflexibility, in a constructive spirit and, I venture to say,\r\nwith ingenuity, in May 1995 we put forward for the\r\nWorking Group’s consideration a formula that could\r\nconstitute the basis for a solution. Nevertheless, all our\r\nefforts have as yet been of no avail in the face of the\r\ninsistence on the part of those who consider that they\r\nhave superior merits and are asking us to go back to\r\ntimes we thought already behind us rather than to move\r\nforward towards an Organization prepared to face the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, as is the wish of\r\nthe vast majority of Member States.\r\nIn a new attempt to unlock the negotiations,\r\nproposals have recently been surfacing for the\r\nestablishment of rotating permanent regional seats, as\r\nalready referred to by other speakers. As they have\r\nindicated, the very term “rotating permanent” embodies\r\nan inevitable semantic, logical and real contradiction.\r\nClearly, if something is permanent, it cannot be rotating,\r\nsince the latter necessarily implies periodic and continuing\r\nchange.\r\nAt the same time, we need to bear very much in\r\nmind that the establishment of this alleged new category\r\nis in fact nothing, I repeat nothing, new. It is precisely the\r\ncurrent system. For example, under the existing\r\narrangement, two rotating seats are permanently, I repeat\r\npermanently, assigned to my region, Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean. Today, they are occupied by Chile and\r\nHonduras. Two years ago, they were occupied by Brazil\r\nand Argentina. The same applies in the case of other\r\nregions. Indonesia and the Republic of Korea were\r\nelected to the two seats permanently assigned to the Asian\r\nGroup. Two years ago, these seats were occupied by\r\nPakistan and Oman. In the case of the Western European\r\nand other States, Italy and Germany were elected to the\r\ntwo seats permanently assigned to that Group. Two years\r\nago, those seats were occupied by Spain and New\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nZealand. The same scheme applies to Africa and Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nThus this apparently innovative suggestion is nothing\r\nother than the current system disguised under a new name.\r\nIn order to understand what is behind this initiative, we\r\nshould like to know whom it affects in each region: in other\r\nwords, which countries in each region would have the right\r\nto participate in the rotation; how often, that is to say, how\r\nmany years they would occupy the seat; and what privileges\r\nthese new seats would carry with them, that is, whether\r\nthey would have the right of veto or not. We hope the\r\nsponsors of this proposal will clarify these questions in due\r\ncourse.\r\nMy delegation, which has participated constructively\r\nin the discussions of the Working Group, regrets that the\r\nclaims of a very small number of countries have prevented\r\nus from making progress towards a viable solution.\r\nAccordingly, we urge those who are seeking a status\r\ncontrary to the spirit of the Charter to abandon their\r\nanachronistic ambitions, which are in any case very far\r\nfrom enjoying the support of the 124 countries necessary\r\nfor the two-thirds majority referred to in Article 108 of the\r\nCharter. We believe that the time has come to make an\r\nhonest choice between what is impossible and what is\r\nfeasible.\r\nMy delegation is in favour of the continuation of the\r\nwork of the Working Group in 1997. That is because we\r\nare convinced that with a serious and realistic attitude it is\r\npossible to achieve a reform which, as President Zedillo\r\nsaid in this same hall,\r\n“is respectful of the purposes and principles that gave\r\nbirth to the Organization, a reform that ensures a more\r\ndemocratic, transparent and efficient system, better\r\nequipped to forge a future of peace”. (Official Records\r\nof the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 36th meeting, p. 17)\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra)(interpretation from\r\nFrench): Allow me to address this Assembly briefly today\r\nin order to reiterate the interest of my State, the Principality\r\nof Andorra, in the process of reforming and enlarging the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council. Since my country was\r\nadmitted to the United Nations in 1993, Andorra has been\r\nguided by the Charter in evaluating possibilities for reform\r\nof that organ, and especially by the spirit inherent in the words\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations determined\r\n... to reaffirm faith ... in the equal rights ... of\r\nnations large and small”.\r\nWithin the Working Group on that subject, we have\r\ncarefully followed the discussions on the right of veto, the\r\npossible increase in the membership of permanent or non-\r\npermanent members, and the possible new characteristics\r\nfor these categories. Being one of the youngest Members\r\nof the United Nations entails maintaining a certain\r\nreserve, even modesty, in the approach to be adopted\r\nwhen faced with a problem as complex as the reform of\r\na vital organ of our Organization. Nevertheless, we spoke\r\nout when we thought that more transparency was needed\r\nin the activities of the Security Council or when the size\r\nof States was to be taken into consideration for possible\r\nmembership of the Council. The principle of sovereign\r\nequality of States, large and small, strong and weak,\r\nembodied in Article 2.1 of the Charter, underlies the very\r\nconcept of the United Nations and we will not cease to\r\ndefend it.\r\nUntil now the number of proposals for reform has\r\nbeen very great. Some States have argued in favour of\r\nincreasing the two categories of members. Others, such as\r\nItaly, propose that we only increase the number of non-\r\npermanent members. Many ideas have been expressed as\r\nto how to choose the members, that is, should we decide\r\non regional or subregional rotation and try to determine\r\nwhether certain States should have seats in the Council\r\nmore frequently than other States? At the same time, we\r\nhave seen a concern emerge that the effectiveness of the\r\nSecurity Council could be damaged if too many members\r\nwere to make decision-making impossible.\r\nHow are we to direct our debates in our joint\r\nendeavour? The Security Council must be operational:\r\nonce expanded, it cannot have more than some 20\r\nmembers without losing in performance, agility and rapid\r\nreaction capability. Perhaps, in fact, in order to facilitate\r\nmore frequent access to non-permanent seats by some\r\nUnited Nations Members, especially those who wish to\r\ninvoke Article 23 (1) —\r\n“due regard being specially paid, in the first\r\ninstance to the contribution of Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and to the\r\nother purposes of the Organization, and also to\r\nequitable geographical distribution” —\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nwe should delete the part of Article 23 (2) which states\r\nthat: “A retiring member shall not be eligible for immediate\r\nre-election”.\r\nThe veto is an historic witness to the Second World\r\nWar, but it is also an indicator of the balance of force and\r\npower which is hard to ignore. Even though it is used less\r\nthan before, it is still at issue in the debate in the\r\nframework of Security Council reform, on which it seems\r\ndifficult to arrive at a consensus. Obviously, if we reach\r\nagreement only on increasing non-permanent members, this\r\nquestion will no longer be so urgent. But if, on the\r\ncontrary, we opt to enlarge the group of permanent\r\nmembers, we will also have to see whether these new\r\nStates will also be given Council status including the right\r\nof veto. This, it would seem to me, requires further in-depth\r\nthought. Some States have already given their sometimes\r\nopposing positions in this regard.\r\nOne delegation at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference,\r\nand in San Francisco, suggested, according to Sydney\r\nBailey, that the United Nations Charter should specify that,\r\nin electing non-permanent members to the Council, special\r\nattention should be paid to military contributions made by\r\nStates for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Military and other contributions made by States\r\nare important and should be rewarded and acknowledged,\r\nespecially for the maintenance of peace where men and\r\nwomen risk their lives in areas of conflict. Nevertheless,\r\nStates with less military capacity would also have a role to\r\nplay in an enlarged Security Council, if necessary. Indeed,\r\nsome small countries, because of their history, are well\r\nacquainted with the art of compromise and negotiation, and\r\ncan bring to the Council a different world view and\r\ndifferent diplomatic skills, which are all quite necessary to\r\nface the new post-cold war situation. Bailey reminds us also\r\nthat representatives of permanent members of the Council\r\ndo not necessarily have more influence than representatives\r\nof non-permanent members:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“I would stress that non-permanent members\r\nhave sometimes played a decisive role, and their\r\nrepresentatives may win high esteem because of\r\npersonal qualities of courtesy, persistence and\r\nintegrity” (Bailey, S., the Procedure of the United\r\nNations Security Council, second edition, Oxford,\r\n1988, p. 110)\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI see in the reform of the Security Council new and\r\ncredible possibilities for seats for small States whose\r\nimpartiality and the nature of whose diplomacy might\r\nbreathe new energy and creativity into the resolution of\r\nconflicts entrusted to the good offices of the Council.\r\nThe Principality of Andorra would like the United\r\nNations to be the standard-bearer of human solidarity —\r\nan effective Organization, respected around the globe, an\r\nOrganization of which the citizens of the world can be\r\nproud. The reform process we have begun should help to\r\nproject this image and to restore the confidence of our\r\ncitizens in the validity of the Organization. In the case of\r\nSecurity Council reform, our major goal is an effective\r\nCouncil adapted to the needs of conflict prevention and\r\nthe maintenance of peace; a Council that acts rather than\r\nreacts; a Council that interacts with the rest of the United\r\nNations, which would have even closer links with the\r\nGeneral Assembly pursuant to the principles of\r\ntransparency and forthright cooperation.\r\nMr. Mahugu (Kenya): The question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council has engaged this Organization since\r\nthree years ago, when the Open-ended Working Group\r\nwas established to consider the matter. Considerable time\r\nand energy have been spent in the inter-sessional periods\r\nwith a view to coming up with a workable consensus\r\nagreement. The delegation of Kenya considers this to be\r\na very important task, and has therefore played an active\r\nrole in all the meetings, formal and informal, with the\r\nexpectation that an agreement would soon be reached on\r\nall the issues.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly early this\r\nmonth, the Foreign Minister of Kenya called for the\r\nreform of the Security Council to reflect the principles of\r\ndemocracy, transparency and equitable representation. He\r\nalso appealed to all Member States to exercise greater\r\nflexibility on the various positions they had taken so far,\r\nin order to reach an early consensus. I wish to reiterate\r\nthat appeal. We are of the view that it is high time that\r\nagreement was reached on this matter.\r\nIn this regard, I recall the positions presented to the\r\nWorking Group by the Non-Aligned Movement, as well\r\nas by the African group. As an active member of those\r\ntwo groups, I can only but reiterate the position already\r\neloquently and succinctly presented to the Working Group\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nby the groups, both of which have presented concrete\r\nproposals.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the Working\r\nGroup, contained in document A/50/47, and its annexes,\r\ncontained in document A/50/47/Add.1. It is evident from\r\nthat report, that the Working Group has covered\r\nconsiderable ground, particularly on the following specific\r\nissues: expansion of the permanent membership; expansion\r\nof the non-permanent membership; curtailment of the veto;\r\nimprovement of the working methods of the Council; and\r\nother matters, including the question of periodic reviews.\r\nFrom the report, it is clear that the notion of the “quick fix”\r\nhas been rejected. An agreement should be reached\r\naddressing the imbalance that now prevails.\r\nThe Security Council, as now constituted, is not\r\nrepresentative, but is a product of the situation which\r\nobtained after the Second World War. Indeed, it is an\r\narrangement that was designed to avoid another war and to\r\nachieve a balance of power during the cold war. The\r\nconduct of international power relations is now\r\ncharacterized by consensus and consultation, and the\r\nconcept of sovereign equality has received universal\r\nrecognition.\r\nThe question of the distribution of permanent and\r\nnon-permanent seats must be reconsidered in view of the\r\nimportant role that the Security Council continues to play\r\nin international peace and security, taking into account that\r\nmost conflicts are now concentrated in developing\r\ncountries. There is no more justification for the continuation\r\nof a situation in which at least two continents are not\r\nrepresented in the permanent membership. In this regard,\r\nAfrica has made a case for at least two permanent seats in\r\nthe Council. There is also a need to address the question of\r\nan expansion of the non-permanent membership to give\r\ngreater meaning to equitable geographical distribution.\r\nIn order to agree on the distribution of seats, it is\r\nimportant that agreement be reached on the overall size of\r\nthe Council. The figure of 25 is the very minimum that\r\nwould ensure equitable distribution. This is the only way\r\nthat could enable us to address the existing imbalance in the\r\nCouncil, where four out of five permanent members now\r\npresent virtually the same form of civilization. There is no\r\nmore justification for Africa and Latin American and the\r\nCaribbean not being represented in the permanent\r\nmembership. The African common position makes it clear\r\nthat seats allocated to the regional groups should be subject\r\nto nomination by their respective regions for eventual\r\nelection by the General Assembly.\r\nWe are of the considered opinion that members of\r\nthe Security Council must, individually and collectively,\r\nact in the collective interest of international peace and\r\nsecurity and not on the basis of their own narrow national\r\ninterests. The principle of regional seats would, in our\r\nview, go a long way towards ensuring this.\r\nWhereas it is imperative that consideration be given\r\nto a country’s contribution to international peace and\r\nsecurity, we are of the view that a criterion based purely\r\non factors such as the size, power, population or even\r\nwealth of a nation would be flawed since none of these\r\nfactors is static. The new arrangements must therefore\r\nhave the intrinsic capacity to be regularly reviewed to\r\nreflect the changing realities of international power\r\nrelations.\r\nOn the question of the veto, we have noted the\r\nreluctance of some members to accept any changes\r\nregarding either its elimination or the curtailment of its\r\nuse. The veto power may have had a justification during\r\nthe cold-war era. However, with the emergence of the\r\nnew international order, characterized by increased\r\nconsultations and consensus, the prolongation of such\r\npower and privilege can no longer be justified. My\r\ndelegation sincerely hopes that an agreement will be\r\nreached at least on the limitation of the use or threat of\r\nuse of the veto, along the following lines: restricted use\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter; a requirement that at\r\nleast two members be required to enforce the veto; and an\r\nenumeration of issues on which the veto cannot apply.\r\nAlthough the use of the veto has been minimized since\r\nthe end of the cold war, there is no doubt that the threat\r\nof the use of the veto has made it impossible for States\r\nMembers of the Organization to engage in a meaningful\r\ndialogue on some issues of grave importance. The use or\r\nthe threat of use of the veto creates an atmosphere in\r\nwhich it is difficult to reach a consensus on such issues.\r\nMy delegation continues to hold the view that the veto is\r\na negative instrument which cannot play a useful role in\r\ndecision-making in the prevailing international\r\natmosphere.\r\nFinally, my delegation welcomes the commendable\r\nefforts that the Security Council has recently initiated to\r\nimprove its working methods and decision-making\r\nprocess. These steps have gone a long way not only\r\ntowards improving transparency but also towards ensuring\r\nthe legitimacy of the Council’s decisions. We therefore\r\ncall for the formalization of these measures through an\r\namendment to the provisional rules of procedure of the\r\nSecurity Council as well as to the relevant sections of the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nCharter. We are of the view that these steps could be taken\r\nwhile the Working Group continues to be seized of the\r\nother, more complicated, questions.\r\nMy delegation will continue to work closely with the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and with other\r\ndelegations as we grapple with these important issues. We\r\nare confident that we shall benefit immensely from\r\nAmbassador Razali’s wide experience and well-known\r\nskills as a consensus-seeker and consensus-builder.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): First, I wish to convey my appreciation to the\r\nco-Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group whose report we\r\nare considering today. Ambassadors Breitenstein of Finland\r\nand Jayanama of Thailand have met the great responsibility\r\nof providing us with a valuable and solid document.\r\nThis document has led me to some very general\r\nreflections which I believe it useful to share. To begin with,\r\nI believe that there continues to be an interest among those\r\nof us who participated in the work of that Group in\r\nincreasing the membership of the Security Council. I also\r\nbelieve — and this is very important — that we all\r\nconsider that the Council should improve its working\r\nmethods in order to increase its transparency. That would\r\nbe the best way to move towards greater efficiency,\r\nrepresentation of legitimacy in its decisions.\r\nIt also seems quite clear that the initial optimism that\r\nrapid decisions would be possible has vanished since the\r\nidea of expanding the Council was put forward at the\r\nbeginning of this decade. We note today that Council\r\nreform is not a simple linear exercise that involves seeking\r\nspecific opinions on who will be members of the new\r\nCouncil, how many new members there will be, for how\r\nlong and with what powers. The matter in fact goes much\r\ndeeper than this. Thanks to the work of the Working Group\r\nand to its wise leadership, we have realized this in time.\r\nThis is a complex matter because it is not a question of\r\nchanging the composition of a principal organ of the United\r\nNations simply because some of us wish to do so, or\r\nbecause it seemed the right thing to do on the occasion of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary. The question at hand is to find\r\nacceptable mechanisms to overcome the crisis of the\r\nOrganization and to provide the Organization with the tools\r\nthat will enable it successfully to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe crisis of the Organization is not, as one hears,\r\nstrictly financial in nature, because all those of us who owe\r\nmoney and who make significant contributions to the\r\nbudget will, in the end, pay our contributions. Nor does\r\nthe crisis of the United Nations necessarily stem from\r\nantiquated structures, because these structures have been\r\nundergoing change.\r\nThe real crisis of our Organization is a crisis in the\r\nmultilateral spirit, a crisis in the spirit of collective action.\r\nIt was this spirit which, in order to put an end to\r\narrangements among the few and to mistrust, led to the\r\nestablishment of the League of Nations, which in 1945\r\ngave way to the United Nations. And it is this spirit\r\nwhich, unfortunately, may be disappearing today. This has\r\nled to a crisis in participation, especially among the\r\nsmallest countries.\r\nThe crisis is reflected in the secret and exclusionary\r\nmethods that the Security Council has practised ever since\r\nthe mid-1980s. The Security Council has become an\r\norgan many of whose deliberations are neither followed\r\nnor witnessed by Member States, nor explained\r\nthoroughly after the fact.\r\nThis is particularly sensitive for countries with\r\nsmaller delegations — in other words, those that represent\r\nsmaller countries. Such countries constitute the vast\r\nmajority of the Members of the United Nations. In\r\ngeneral, these countries can least influence the processes\r\nin which the Security Council is involved.\r\nIn this respect we should ask how many times this\r\nmajority of countries is consulted or informed when there\r\nis no urgent vote in the Assembly. This is what I would\r\nterm a crisis of participation; it is the most important\r\ncrisis, because it weakens the multilateral system at its\r\nroots.\r\nIt follows that we who form the majority would like\r\nto see, as a condition of any reform, greater transparency\r\nand wider participation in the Security Council. We\r\ncertainly all wish that the changes will put an end to\r\nunnecessary secrecy, exclusion, delays in distributing\r\ninformation and the fact that it is impossible for us to\r\nparticipate. Listening to the presentation of reports and\r\nforming our own opinions, for example, is a useful way\r\nof participating which would not affect confidential\r\nprivate consultations. Such consultations have always\r\nexisted, and will continue to do so, because they are a\r\nnecessary part of any negotiating process.\r\nIn this context, I believe that it would be useful to\r\nrecall the comments of Mr. Alain Juppé, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of France — a permanent member of the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nSecurity Council and a founding Member of the United\r\nNations — in document A/49/667 of 11 November 1994.\r\nHis comments are in line with ours. This document states,\r\ninter alia:\r\n“In his statement to the General Assembly, Mr. Alain\r\nJuppé ... expressed the wish for the Security Council\r\nto increase its reliance on public debate in reaching its\r\ndecisions”. (A/49/667, p. 1)\r\nI also wish to emphasize the comments, made in a similar\r\nvein, of the distinguished African representative,\r\nAmbassador Simbarashe Simbanenduku Mumbengegwi of\r\nZimbabwe. On 31 March 1992, in the Security Council\r\nitself, he stated:\r\n“Finally, this 15-member Council acts on behalf of a\r\ntotal of 175 States Members of the United Nations.\r\nThis means that 160 States have placed their security,\r\nand possibly their very survival, in the hands of the\r\n15. This is a solemn and heavy responsibility that each\r\nand every member of the Council carries. It is\r\ntherefore of crucial importance that every decision\r\ntaken by the Security Council be able to withstand the\r\ncareful scrutiny of the 160 Member States on whose\r\nbehalf the Council is expected to act.” (S/PV.3063,\r\np. 54-55)\r\nWhat we all, without exception, wish for is a Security\r\nCouncil that is forward-looking and does not fall back into\r\nthe structures of the past. Those structures were the result\r\nof wars, and as such no discussion or consultation took\r\nplace on them. That was in the past. With the end of the\r\ncold war and the dissolution of East-West antagonism, that\r\npast, fortunately, has come to an end.\r\nHence, we should not encourage further unjustified\r\nelitism. Today we must look towards the future. The\r\nWorking Group must guide the Assembly and the Council.\r\nTo a certain extent, and for this reason, the mandate of the\r\nGroup is of such overriding importance that it should not be\r\nset aside. Perhaps this fact was not duly realized.\r\nWhen we consider the Council’s agenda over the past\r\nfew years, we see that the main conflicts with which it has\r\nbeen dealing have taken place within, rather than between\r\ncountries. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali made that clear in his\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization. For us, this\r\nmeans that the Council must also deal with emergency\r\nsituations for civilian populations, propose humanitarian\r\nmeasures, punish terrorism, promote specific cases of\r\ndisarmament and even help with social issues and matters\r\nrelating to development and political organization within\r\ncountries in conflict.\r\nIn today’s world the concept of a threat to peace is\r\nnot the same as it was in 1945 or 1964. This has resulted\r\nin the Council’s novel, though debatable, interpretation of\r\nChapter VII of the Charter. It has also resulted in\r\ndevelopment being considered part of that broad concept\r\nof peace, an idea that has been supported by the\r\nnon-aligned countries and the countries of Latin America.\r\nWe must accept the fact that we have made progress, and\r\nthat our parameters today are more demanding than those\r\nof the past.\r\nMy participation in the debates of this Assembly\r\nbegan only recently, but I must confess that discussing\r\nthe expansion of the Security Council as we have been\r\ndoing seems somewhat frustrating. It is frustrating and\r\nworrying that the majority of the Members of the United\r\nNations could believe that this discussion is ultimately of\r\ninterest only to a minority. I also believe that it is\r\nfrustrating constantly to discuss formulas that permanently\r\nexclude countries that have made valuable and proven\r\ncontributions to the collective tasks of the Organization\r\nfor many years and which, furthermore, are among the\r\nmain contributors to the Organization. Such formulas,\r\ncoming after three years of work, are not realistic and are\r\nprobably one of the causes of the deadlock. If these\r\nformulas are not acceptable, we should not, for the\r\npresent, insist on them.\r\nIt is also worrying to hear it said that, in the end, a\r\npackage will have to be negotiated. What package? It is\r\nnot as though the changes required in other areas of the\r\nUnited Nations, which are truly urgent, cannot follow\r\ntheir course while the enlargement of the Council is still\r\nunder discussion.\r\nThe impression of the public and parliaments of\r\nmany countries is that the Organization needs to be\r\nrestructured so as to be less of a burden and to help\r\nensure good governance and development. The question\r\nof the expansion of the Council as viewed so far is not so\r\nurgent.\r\nIt has been hinted that the Council needs to be\r\nexpanded because this would help relieve the deficit. This\r\nargument is not even worth considering.\r\nIn the light of and despite all we have heard, we can\r\ncarry on discussing the matter as we have done to date,\r\nbut let us not forget that this is not a constructive debate\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nbecause it is deeply divisive for regions, the only basis on\r\nwhich any kind of representation could be founded. On the\r\ncontrary, I believe that we could make a more in-depth\r\nanalysis of the host of proposals not based on exclusionary\r\ncriteria.\r\nThe Council’s current agenda and worldwide trends\r\ncall for broader-based formulas. In my view, we need a\r\nCouncil with bona fide members politically motivated to\r\nface the new agendas with time-tested convictions.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The agenda item on equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nother related matters is one of the most significant and\r\nimportant on the agenda of the General Assembly. That has\r\nbeen made by the numerous references to the need to\r\nreform and democratize the Security Council made during\r\nthe recent general debate and by the long list of speakers\r\nfor today’s debate.\r\nFor our delegation, the necessary restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council involves the expansion of the number of\r\nits permanent and non-permanent members, the application\r\nof the principle of equitable geographical distribution and\r\nthe introduction of reforms that ensure democracy and\r\ntransparency in its work on the basis of the Council’s\r\nprocedures and authority being in accordance with the\r\npowers granted under the Charter.\r\nIn this comprehensive process of reforms, it is also\r\nparamount to revitalize the General Assembly and to\r\nrehabilitate the essential links between it and the Council.\r\nThis would enable the sole universal organ of the United\r\nNations fully to exercise its authority, including the right to\r\nremain duly informed of the Council’s activities and\r\ndecisions and to make the recommendations it deems\r\nnecessary, since the Council acts as a representative of and\r\nat the behest of all the Member States.\r\nAt the fiftieth session of the General Assembly, the\r\nCuban delegation participated with interest, flexibility and\r\nrespect for the opinions of others in the deliberations of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council reform.\r\nMany variables emerged or were reiterated during the\r\nnegotiations and the positions expressed by countries and\r\nregional groups varied greatly, which has turned this\r\nWorking Group into a broad-based and complex forum.\r\nLogically, the search for consensus on critical issues of\r\nuniversal interest is a process that demands flexibility and\r\ntime. It is only natural that it be controversial or sometimes\r\nseem too slow or contradictory, but it is the only\r\ndemocratic and sure way to find better solutions that have\r\nhad time to mature and can be shared by all. In our\r\nopinion, this scenario is reflected to a great extent in the\r\nreport the Working Group submitted to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn this connection, the Cuban delegation wishes in\r\nparticular to acknowledge the active presidency of Mr.\r\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral and the laudable and tireless\r\nwork of the Vice-Presidents of the Working Group, the\r\nPermanent Representatives of Finland, Mr. Breitenstein,\r\nand of Thailand, Mr. Jayanama, whose efforts and\r\npatience we highly appreciate.\r\nAs a result of the negotiations on this item, Member\r\nStates have been able to identify trends, priorities and\r\naspects without which it would not be possible to create\r\na solid consensus to keep us from hasty and artificial\r\nsolutions.\r\nOur delegation, as a member of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, endorsed and reiterates a motto that is widely\r\nsupported today: It is necessary objectively to evaluate the\r\ndirect historical relationship between the diversity and\r\nnumber of Security Council members and the\r\nOrganization’s membership.\r\nMore than 50 years after its inception, the United\r\nNations has changed radically. The remarkable increase\r\nin the number and diversity of its Members, which aspire\r\nto participate equitably in all the bodies and spheres of\r\nactivity of the Organization, is in our opinion one of the\r\nessential bases of the reform process in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe strict application of the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution should be the cornerstone of\r\nSecurity Council expansion, because it is the only genuine\r\nway to ensure the necessary representative and democratic\r\nnature, transparency and effectiveness of that organ.\r\nAny formula that excludes the interests of\r\ndeveloping countries from this process would be\r\ncounterproductive, because the main imbalance to be\r\nredressed in the composition of the Security Council is,\r\nin fact, the underrepresentation of developing countries.\r\nWe recognize that this is not the only element to be\r\nconsidered, but it is certainly the most important.\r\nWe have studied with profound interest and attention\r\nevery proposal submitted to the Working Group on the\r\nincrease of the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\nmembers, as well as the options for a more frequent\r\nrotation of non-permanent seats. The Working Group’s\r\ndeliberations have shown that a significant number of\r\nMember States do not support the establishment of so-\r\ncalled permanent seats, an option that, regrettably, would\r\nalways be discriminatory and selective in and of itself and\r\nin relation to the permanent members, and would never\r\nensure the representation deserved and desired by the\r\ndeveloping world, at least so long as the category of\r\npermanent membership continues to exist.\r\nWith regard to the democratization, transparency and\r\nreview of the Council’s working methods and procedures,\r\nthe Working Group examined many objective and\r\ncomprehensive proposals, including those submitted by the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe acknowledge with pleasure that, in the past few\r\nyears, in response to the repeated demands of the\r\nOrganization’s Member States, which the Security Council\r\nrepresents and is accountable to, some measures have been\r\nimplemented, which we welcomed with satisfaction, aimed\r\nat improving the transparency of the mechanisms and\r\ndecision-making process of the Council. However, such\r\nmeasures will only be effective when they are\r\ninstitutionalized once and for all. In this respect, our\r\ndelegation endorses the criterion that the process of\r\ninstitutionalization must be implemented de facto through\r\nthe adoption of the final rules of procedure of the Security\r\nCouncil and a thorough revision of the relevant provisions\r\nof the Charter.\r\nThe veto issue has also been the subject of substantive\r\ndeliberations. In recent times the Security Council has\r\nadopted consensus decisions on the most diverse\r\ninternational issues and on core peacekeeping and\r\ninternational security matters. But there have been other\r\ndecisions that have not been, nor should they be considered,\r\nexpressions of real consensus in the Security Council. We\r\ncannot underestimate the enormous damage to the\r\ncredibility of the United Nations and the Security Council\r\ncaused by double standards in the latter’s actions, often\r\nrelated to the principle or use of the veto.\r\nThe silent threat of the use of the veto continues to be\r\nan influential factor in some decisions and pronouncements\r\nof this body. Thus, our delegation stands for the complete\r\nelimination of the institution of the veto and, until then, at\r\nleast a gradual restriction of that privilege.\r\nThe General Assembly and the Working Group can\r\ncount on our delegation’s constructive, flexible and modest\r\ncontribution and its respect for the opinions of others.\r\nCuba is deeply committed to the goals of an authentic and\r\nfar-reaching reform of the Security Council, a reform\r\nguided by José Martí’s formula: with everyone and for\r\nthe good of everyone.\r\nMr. Ruiz Pérez (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to address the Assembly,\r\non behalf of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM), on the agenda item before us. The Non-Aligned\r\nMovement has attached the utmost importance to the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters.\r\nThe non-aligned countries have participated actively in\r\nthe deliberations of the Open-ended Working Group since\r\nits establishment three years ago.\r\nOn various occasions the Movement has expressed\r\nits position on the matters under consideration by the\r\nWorking Group. During the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly last year, we presented the decisions adopted\r\non these matters at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of\r\nState or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at\r\nCartagena in October 1995.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement has stressed the urgent\r\nneed to democratize the United Nations in a way that\r\nreflects the universal nature of the Organization and\r\nfulfils the principle of sovereign equality of States. The\r\nNon-Aligned Movement has pointed out the need for\r\ndemocracy and transparency in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAs expressed in the final communiqué of the\r\nmeeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of\r\ndelegation of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries,\r\nheld at New York on 25 September last, in the framework\r\nof the fifty-first session of the General Assembly the\r\nMinisters and heads of delegation renewed their support\r\nfor the proposal submitted by the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries on 13 February 1995 to the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council. They also expressed their support for\r\nthe document entitled, “The question of the veto”, also\r\nsubmitted to the Working Group by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. My delegation wishes to reiterate, on behalf\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, that the Movement will\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 29 October 1996\r\ncontinue to participate in the work of the Working Group\r\nin a constructive, concerted and active manner.\r\nMy delegation had the honour of reading the\r\ndeclaration issued by the Non-Aligned Movement on the\r\nitem under consideration, and it has our full support. Allow\r\nme now to express the position of the Government of\r\nColombia on the agenda item under consideration.\r\nAfter three years of discussion by the Working Group,\r\nwe have before us a report that goes beyond its\r\npredecessors and contains important substantive aspects. It\r\nis obvious, as the report shows, that, first, there is\r\nconsensus within the Group on the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, the review of its working methods, the\r\nstrengthening of its capacity and effectiveness, the\r\nenhancement of its representativeness and the improvement\r\nof its working efficiency.\r\nSecondly, the work of reforming the Council should\r\nbe based on the principles of sovereign equality of all\r\nMembers of the United Nations, equitable geographical\r\ndistribution and contribution to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as to the other\r\npurposes of the Organization.\r\nThirdly, in that context, the concepts of transparency,\r\nlegitimacy, efficiency and democracy should be taken into\r\naccount.\r\nRegarding the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, the report properly reflects what has been\r\nexpressed by a large number of delegations regarding the\r\nneed for the Security Council to improve its working\r\nmethods and transparency in the light of experience gained\r\non issues such as the reports of the Council to the General\r\nAssembly; briefings to States non-members of the Council;\r\nconsultations with current and potential troop-contributing\r\ncountries; the effective flow of information and exchange\r\nof views between the Council and the Assembly; and the\r\nparticipation of countries non-members of the Council in its\r\ndebates, as set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter.\r\nThe report also reflects the wide support for the\r\nproposals on working methods submitted by the Non-\r\nAligned Movement at the forty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly, and those submitted by Argentina and New\r\nZealand which, as has been stated on various occasions, are\r\nentirely complementary.\r\nWith respect to the size and composition of the\r\nSecurity Council, the report shows a clear reaffirmation of\r\nthe agreement existing on the need to expand the\r\nmembership of the Security Council while ensuring\r\nequitable geographical distributions, in the light of the\r\nsubstantial increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations, especially in terms of developing countries.\r\nThe report also emphasizes the wide support for the\r\nproposal of the Non-Aligned Movement that, should no\r\nconsensus be reached on other categories of membership,\r\nthe increase in the number of members should for the\r\ntime being take place only in the category of non-\r\npermanent members. Support for this position not only\r\nincluded that of the 113 members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, but also that of a considerable number of\r\nother countries that are not members of the Movement.\r\nWith regard to the adoption of decisions in the\r\nSecurity Council, including the question of the veto, the\r\nreport reflects the proposal of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement — which is also supported by a large number\r\nof non-member countries — to limit and rationalize the\r\nveto through an amendment to the Charter establishing as\r\na first step that the veto be applicable only to actions\r\nundertaken under Chapter VII of the Charter. Other\r\nproposals on the matter submitted by Mexico and\r\nUruguay received special consideration and support in the\r\ndeliberations of the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nColombia has opposed the veto power ever since the\r\nSan Francisco Conference, which it considers to be\r\ncontrary to the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates. Maintenance of the veto power also runs contrary\r\nto the aim of democratization shared by an overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States of this Organization.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement, in its document of 13\r\nFebruary 1995, indicated that the veto power, which\r\nguarantees an exclusive and dominant role to the\r\npermanent members of the Council, is contrary to the aim\r\nof democratizing the United Nations and therefore must\r\nbe reviewed.\r\nSince we are unable to eliminate the veto power in\r\nthe current circumstances we should, at least as a\r\nprovisional measure, define and limit its scope of\r\napplication, while bearing constantly in mind that only its\r\ncomplete elimination will permit the full exercise of\r\ndemocracy in the Security Council.\r\nFor this reason, we resolutely support the document\r\nsubmitted by the Non-Aligned Movement regarding the\r\nquestion of the veto, which responds to the need for\r\nlimiting the veto with a view to its elimination.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
