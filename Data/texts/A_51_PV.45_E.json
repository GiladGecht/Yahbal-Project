(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 47 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)\r\n(interpretation from French): First, I would like to thank\r\nthe representatives of Finland and of Thailand for their\r\noutstanding efforts in organizing so well the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. With much skill and with great integrity, they have\r\nconducted the work in a generally satisfactory manner. I\r\nwish them good luck and every success in the long and\r\ndifficult task ahead.\r\nThe Lao delegation would like today to reaffirm its\r\nwell-known position, which has been stated repeatedly both\r\nhere in plenary meeting and in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. We believe that there is a need to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council by increasing its\r\nmembership so as to better reflect the new global political\r\nrealities and in particular — I repeat, in particular — to\r\nimprove the representation of the developing countries. Like\r\nmany other delegations, we continue to believe that the\r\nnumber of both permanent and non-permanent members\r\nshould increase. Indeed, the Lao delegation believes that an\r\nincrease in the number of permanent members, from both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, would strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations and its legitimacy because the Organization\r\nwould thus better reflect the new international political\r\nconfiguration. An increase in the non-permanent members\r\nis no less important. Such an increase would allow more\r\nStates to hold seats on and participate in the work of the\r\nCouncil, thus increasing its credibility.\r\nAs for the criteria for selecting new permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members, my delegation takes note of the\r\nobservations and proposals that have been made, and we\r\nhope that a formula acceptable to all will soon be found.\r\nWe believe that — because of their importance and their\r\npolitical and economic influence — countries such as\r\nGermany, Japan and India should be become permanent\r\nmembers of a newly expanded Security Council.\r\nAfter more than three years of lengthy, difficult\r\ndiscussions, we have arrived at a point where, we believe,\r\nwe should assess the situation. It is important to know\r\nwhether we are at an impasse. If we are not, let us\r\ncontinue and let us make greater efforts and work with\r\nrenewed vigour towards our common goal: the\r\nstrengthening of the effectiveness of the Security Council.\r\nIf, on the other hand, we are at an impasse, we must have\r\nthe courage to ask the following questions: What can we\r\ndo? Why has this come about? And how can we work\r\ntogether to find a realistic solution to this problem? This\r\nis what my delegation wishes to tell the Assembly at the\r\ncrucial stage of our debate. Our delegation is prepared to\r\nconsider any new, realistic approach which would help to\r\nadvance the work of the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nWe commend certain measures that the Security\r\nCouncil has already taken to improve its practices and\r\nworking methods so as to make them more transparent. We\r\nare on the right path, and we should continue in this\r\ndirection. However, much still remains to be done.\r\nAccordingly, we still are of the view that the Council must\r\ninform and consult non-members of the Council that are\r\naffected by its decisions. Even more important, those\r\ncountries should have the right to state their positions to the\r\nCouncil publicly, before the Council embarks on informal\r\nconsultations, and they should also be able to be present as\r\nobservers in informal consultations of the whole on the\r\nitem relating to them. This practice can only be beneficial,\r\nbecause the Council, by hearing from these countries,\r\nwould understand them better and would therefore be in a\r\nbetter position to contribute to a solution to the conflict in\r\nquestion.\r\nThe question of the reform of the Council is neither\r\nsimple nor easy. It is of unprecedented complexity. We are\r\nneither too optimistic nor too pessimistic. Let us work\r\ntogether with patience and perseverance but, in particular,\r\nwith greater vigour. With collaboration and consultation\r\namong all, we very sincerely believe that we can go\r\nforward.\r\nMr. Biørn Lian (Norway): I have the honour to speak\r\non this agenda item on behalf of the Nordic countries:\r\nDenmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and my own country,\r\nNorway.\r\nAllow me first to say that the Nordic countries\r\nconsider reform of the Security Council an urgent priority.\r\nWe have therefore participated actively in the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, and we submitted a revised\r\nNordic position paper in June last year. The basic elements\r\nof that paper are still valid and I would like to go briefly\r\nthrough some important elements of the Nordic position.\r\nFirst of all, the fundamental objective of Security\r\nCouncil reform should be, as we see it, to strengthen the\r\ncapacity of the Council to discharge its duties in accordance\r\nwith the Charter. The Nordic countries support an increase\r\nin the permanent as well as in the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Council. The permanent membership\r\nshould be increased by five new seats. These new\r\npermanent seats should be allocated with the aim of having\r\nthe Security Council better reflect present political and\r\neconomic realities, including improved representation in the\r\nCouncil from Africa, Asia and Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean. In order to ensure equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation, it is also essential to increase the number of\r\nnon-permanent seats. For these seats, regions should be\r\nencouraged to establish equitable rotation systems, and the\r\nre-election ban should be maintained. The total\r\nmembership of the Council should lie in the low to mid-\r\ntwenties; in the Nordic position paper we have suggested\r\n23.\r\nThe question of the decision-making procedures of\r\nthe Council needs thorough consideration. Different\r\naspects of the voting procedure — such as the scope of\r\nthe veto and its possible extension to new permanent\r\nmembers — are interrelated. These questions are likely to\r\nbe settled only as part of a comprehensive reform of the\r\nCouncil, and should therefore be addressed by the\r\nWorking Group in that perspective.\r\nThe Nordic countries encourage the implementation\r\nof further measures that enjoy broad support and which\r\nhave the aim of improving the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council and the transparency of its work. We\r\nwelcome the steps that the Council has taken in this\r\nrespect. We attach particular importance to the new\r\narrangements established for consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nAfter long deliberations, the Working Group\r\nsubmitted quite a substantive report to the fiftieth session\r\nof the General Assembly. We welcome that report. It\r\nincludes a great deal of convergence of views on several\r\nissues. The discussions in the Working Group during the\r\nlast session were thorough and useful. A number of\r\ninteresting proposals were made with a view to\r\nfacilitating compromise solutions to the complex problems\r\ninvolved. We consider that major elements of a\r\ncomprehensive reform are now on the table, and that the\r\nWorking Group should move to a more concrete phase in\r\nits work as soon as it resumes its deliberations. We note\r\nthat this view was also expressed by a number of\r\nspeakers during the general debate at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Nordic countries thus feel that the time is now\r\nripe for the Working Group to move away from a general\r\ndiscussion and to engage in real negotiations. But, at the\r\nsame time, we are aware that the subject matter before us\r\nis politically both complicated and sensitive. Mindful of\r\nthe necessity to avoid a political impasse, it is essential\r\nthat we all approach the process we are engaged in in a\r\npositive manner and continue to actively explore creative\r\nand constructive ideas on how to meet the various\r\nconcerns involved. The Nordic countries stand ready to\r\nmake our contribution to such efforts. The Nordic\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\ncountries pledge their full support to you, Mr. President,\r\nand to the other members of the Bureau in the very\r\nimportant work you have before you.\r\nMr. Shah (India): Mr. President, as the Assembly\r\ncontinues its consideration of agenda item 47, I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to place on record my delegation’s\r\nappreciation of your predecessor, Ambassador Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral’s, sagacious guidance of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil. I would like to also thank the co-Vice-Chairmen,\r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Finland and of Thailand,\r\nfor their untiring efforts in steering the discussions during\r\nthe last session.\r\nThe comprehensive and substantive report of the\r\nWorking Group, contained in document A/50/47, is a vivid\r\nreflection of the status of deliberations on the subject. It\r\nplaces in perspective all aspects of the work undertaken on\r\nthis vital issue thus far, indicates the complexities,\r\nhighlights areas of congruence, delineates prevalent trends\r\nand clarifies the continuing differences. It is a reflection of\r\nthe progress achieved so far. It is also a testimony to the\r\nfact that, given time, sustained efforts and patience,\r\nconsensual progress can be achieved in regard to the\r\nunresolved issues before the Working Group.\r\nThe annexes to the report are a reflection of the\r\nseriousness with which Member States have approached the\r\nsubject. As many as 10 of the working papers submitted\r\nduring the course of the last session focused on the core\r\nissue of membership, four dealt with the veto and decision-\r\nmaking process, and three were related to various aspects\r\nof the Council’s working methods. This is in addition to the\r\nwealth of ideas suggested earlier and compiled in document\r\nA/49/965. Briefly, the discussions have evoked widespread\r\ninterest and multifaceted responses. The opinions expressed\r\nare an indication of the vibrancy of the deliberations and\r\nthe ingenuity that Member States have brought to the\r\nconsideration of this important yet complex subject.\r\nIndia was among the 10 Member States that initiated\r\nthe process of the inscription of this item on the agenda of\r\nthe General Assembly at the thirty-fourth session. The\r\nimperatives of expansion and reform that spurred that initial\r\nstep have been subsumed in the mandate provided to the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, owing to the substantial\r\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations,\r\nespecially of developing countries, and to changes in\r\ninternational relations. Consequently, suggestions for\r\nsolutions have to address the problem of the imbalance in\r\nthe representative nature of the Security Council and\r\nshould not accentuate existing inequities.\r\nIndia’s views on the question of expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council are well known and were most recently\r\nreiterated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of India in\r\nhis address to the General Assembly on 4 October, when\r\nhe stated,\r\n“India supports expansion of both the permanent and\r\nthe non-permanent categories. We are against\r\npiecemeal or temporary solutions which discriminate\r\nagainst developing countries. We believe that the\r\nsame yardstick must be applied to all countries,\r\ndeveloped or developing, from all regions or groups,\r\nfor induction as permanent members. We believe\r\nthat under any objectively derived criteria for the\r\nexpansion of permanent members, India would be an\r\nobvious candidate.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n22nd meeting, p. 15)\r\nMy delegation welcomes the decision taken at the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly to extend the\r\ntenure of the Working Group. We expect that when the\r\nGroup reconvenes next year, it will proceed to build upon\r\nthe progress already achieved. We encourage the Group\r\nto work towards consensus-building on the major issue of\r\nexpansion of the Security Council. For the Group to\r\nachieve a just and lasting solution to this very important\r\nissue, the prevailing suspicion that some parties might still\r\nbe considering a quick fix must be eliminated through\r\ntransparency and honesty.\r\nIt has been suggested on occasion that one country\r\nor the other should be added to the permanent category\r\nwithout going through a process of selection on the basis\r\nof relevant criteria. Paragraph 28 of the report\r\nacknowledges that criteria have been suggested by\r\nMember States to serve as the basis for selection. We\r\nbelieve that it would be prudent and beneficial for the\r\nWorking Group to examine this further and come up with\r\nan acceptable set of criteria against which the claims of\r\nevery country could be assessed. Selection should follow\r\nrather than precede the establishment of criteria.\r\nThe non-aligned countries emphasized in the\r\nCartagena Summit Declaration that any attempt to exclude\r\nnon-aligned countries from an expansion in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council would be\r\nunacceptable. This and other important proposals made by\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement have found wide acceptance in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. The legitimacy and\r\nefficacy of the Security Council is directly linked to its\r\nrepresentative nature. It is a recognition of this reality that\r\nin paragraph 26 of the report of the Working Group it is\r\nexplicitly stated:\r\n“In the event that there is agreement for an increase in\r\nthe permanent membership, an increase only by\r\nindustrialized countries would be widely regarded as\r\nunacceptable.” (A/50/47)\r\nIndia believes that in our discussion on the reform\r\npackage, the Council’s working methods and decision-\r\nmaking procedures should also necessarily receive adequate\r\nattention. The report of the Working Group highlights that\r\nthe consideration of this aspect has “deepened” and that\r\nthere is “a considerable convergence” of views. A number\r\nof imaginative, innovative and far-reaching proposals have\r\nbeen made. They are based on the premise that since the\r\nCouncil acts under the fiduciary responsibility bestowed by\r\nMember States, it has an obligation to take cognizance of\r\ntheir views, be transparent in decision-making, not encroach\r\non the jurisdiction of the General Assembly, and adjust and\r\nadapt to the aspirations and needs of the Member States.\r\nReform of the Security Council’s working methods and\r\ndecision-making procedures is intrinsic to any\r\ncomprehensive outcome.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations in all its aspects is\r\nour collective responsibility. Such reform must address not\r\nonly the failings of the past but also the needs of the future.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is cardinal to any\r\nreform of the United Nations. Such reform should therefore\r\nbe undertaken on the sound basis of durability, resilience\r\nand experience rather than expediency and artificial time-\r\nframes designed to force the pace. Decisions on an issue as\r\nimportant as the structure, composition and functioning of\r\nthe Security Council cannot be taken but by consensus.\r\nMr. President, my delegation has noted the promptness\r\nwith which you have moved in constituting the Bureau of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. May I assure you that\r\nIndia will constructively support your efforts when the\r\nGroup resumes its work next year.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): The latest report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil (A/50/47) marks, in my delegation’s view, the first\r\ntruly substantive account of the status and progress of\r\ndiscussions on issues before the Group since its inception.\r\nMore importantly, the report records a growing\r\nconvergence of views and wide support in the Group on\r\nmany issues. However, it also reflects differences on key\r\nissues.\r\nThe issue of increased membership in the Security\r\nCouncil cannot be considered in isolation but has to be\r\naddressed in the context of the reform of the Council,\r\nreforms towards greater transparency and democracy of\r\nits working methods and towards a more balanced\r\nrelationship with the General Assembly. In terms of our\r\nwork, this should translate into aiming for an agreement\r\nconsisting of significant elements relating to an expanded\r\nsize and a more representative composition of the\r\nCouncil, the enhanced transparency of the Council’s\r\nworking methods and the democratization of its decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nAlthough there has long been agreement to expand\r\nthe membership of the Security Council, the Group\r\nremains deadlocked on the issue of expanding permanent\r\nmembership. Efforts must therefore focus on finding\r\ncommon ground for a compromise on this issue. In this\r\nconnection, the Group should explore various options,\r\nwhich, in turn, could principally be based on the existing\r\nproposals on expansion as well as on any future\r\nsubmissions. Some of these options could include, first,\r\nthe 2+3 formula or other combinations of increases in\r\npermanent and non-permanent seats, including the\r\nregional rotation of permanent seats; secondly, the shared-\r\nseat formula; thirdly, proposals for purely non-permanent\r\nexpansion; and finally, the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nproposal for an expansion of non-permanent members for\r\nthe time being, if no agreement is reached on permanent\r\nmembers. We suggest that all the proposals falling under\r\nthese broad options be examined with a view to\r\nidentifying their common elements or identifying those\r\nproposals that could form the basis for compromise.\r\nThe issue of the Council’s working methods\r\nconstitutes a vital and essential component of this\r\nexercise. The Group should aim at building upon the\r\nreport’s observation in paragraph 20 that “discussions\r\nshowed a considerable convergence of views” on the\r\nissue of the working methods and transparency of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Group should aim to recommend\r\nto the General Assembly at an early date concrete and\r\nspecific measures on the basis of existing written and oral\r\nproposals on this subject, which, as stated in paragraph 22\r\nof the report, “received wide support in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group”. These proposals are geared towards\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nmaking the Council’s working methods more transparent or\r\nopen as well as enhancing the relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the general membership and other principal\r\nUnited Nations organs.\r\nThe Group should also devote serious attention to\r\nspecific measures which would contribute to the\r\ndemocratization of the Council’s decision-making process.\r\nTowards this end, the proposals on the table deserve full\r\nconsideration by the Group, including those on the veto.\r\nThe veto is an integral part of the issue of decision-making,\r\nand we look forward to a meaningful outcome on that\r\nsubject.\r\nMy delegation believes that at its next round of\r\nsubstantive discussions the Working Group should aim at\r\ntranslating the “wide support” on issues or proposals\r\nindicated in the report into concrete recommendations. It\r\nshould also seek to reconcile differences on the other\r\nissues. Although the report would serve as a good starting\r\npoint for the Working Group’s next round of discussions,\r\nthe Group might wish to consider subsequently, at the\r\nappropriate time, the feasibility of working on the basis of\r\na discussion paper or approximate draft discussion text. The\r\ncontent of this paper would naturally depend on the state of\r\nplay at the time, if ever, when it is considered feasible.\r\nWhat is important is that such a paper could facilitate and\r\nfocus our consideration of all relevant issues by enabling us\r\nto move away from the past format of general statements\r\nand reactions.\r\nMr. Pérez-Otermin (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The subject before us is undoubtedly the most\r\nimportant of all, as it involves changing the structure of the\r\norgan of greatest political power in the Organization: the\r\nSecurity Council. Therefore, the task of the Vice-Chairmen\r\nof the Working Group is also, as we see it, the most\r\ndifficult. My delegation is fully aware of all this and\r\ntherefore wishes once again to congratulate Ambassador\r\nBreitenstein of Finland and Ambassador Jayanama of\r\nThailand on the work they have accomplished, and in\r\nparticular for the preparation of the final document.\r\nIt can be seen from what I have said that my country\r\nattaches prime importance to this subject, and, without\r\nprejudice to our own ideas for contributing to the\r\nmodernization of the Security Council, we will always be\r\nprepared to study and discuss any other initiative in order\r\nto contribute to the achievement of a broad consensus.\r\nIt is Uruguay’s view, first of all, that a reform of the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council would contribute to a\r\npolitical updating of its structure, thereby giving it greater\r\nrepresentativity. The changes that have taken place in the\r\nworld since the signing of the San Francisco Charter and\r\nsince the only expansion of the Council which took place\r\nin 1965, have been of enormous importance, and it can be\r\nstated unequivocally that these changes could not have\r\nbeen foreseen by most world leaders, scholars and\r\nobservers of the political scene.\r\nThe Security Council is the essentially political\r\norgan created under the Charter. Since its structure,\r\ncompetence and decision-making process were established\r\naccordingly, it must inevitably be restructured in line with\r\nchanges to the foundation on which it has rested. It is\r\ntherefore Uruguay’s view that the composition and\r\nnumber of its members, both permanent and non-\r\npermanent, should be structured in accordance with the\r\nnew political reality.\r\nSecondly, it is Uruguay’s view that any change in\r\nthe number of its members, bearing in mind not only the\r\nsize of the Council but also its decision-making\r\nmechanism, should take account of the fact that the\r\nSecurity Council is intrinsically an executive organ, and\r\nthe change should therefore not affect this essential\r\ncharacteristic. This would mean the paralysis of the organ,\r\nand thus the end of the Organization.\r\nThirdly, in keeping with its deepest democratic\r\nconvictions, and in concurrence with virtually all the\r\nstatements made by the political leaders who attended the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, Uruguay agrees with the need to democratize the\r\nOrganization and to strengthen the General Assembly. We\r\ntherefore believe that it is the right time to begin to\r\ndiscuss proposals to that end.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation submitted an\r\ninitiative aimed at beginning to reduce the absolute power\r\nof the right of veto. This proposal is contained in annex\r\nXII and has been issued as document\r\nA/AC.247/1996/CRP.14. The proposal is based on the fact\r\nthat the veto mechanism is contained in most democratic\r\nconstitutions in the world today. Its goal is to balance the\r\nrelationship between the executive and legislative\r\nbranches in states of law. Thus, everyone is quite familiar\r\nwith the veto power of executive branches and the power\r\nof parliaments to override vetoes by a given majority. The\r\nmechanism allows for various gradations in\r\nimplementation, and therefore its application to the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly could be the subject of broad negotiations.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nFor example, there could be negotiations on when it\r\nwould be appropriate for the General Assembly to\r\nintervene; on the possibility of the Assembly acting only in\r\ncases where a single Member State has exercised veto\r\npower; on the possibility of the Assembly intervening when\r\nmore than one State has exercised veto power; and on the\r\nnecessary majority for the General Assembly to override a\r\nveto.\r\nSuch a mechanism would undeniably contribute to\r\nmeeting the aspirations reiterated by almost all the political\r\nleaders of the world and expressed at the commemoration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to\r\ndemocratize the Organization and to strengthen the General\r\nAssembly. We have no doubt that such a mechanism would\r\ndo both.\r\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, it is Uruguay’s\r\nview that any Security Council reform must be\r\nuncomplicated so as to avoid any major modification to the\r\nCharter, to preserve the essence of its basic tenets and not\r\nto alter its purposes and principles. One of these principles\r\nis the sovereign equality of all States, which must be amply\r\napplied in whatever procedures are used to agree on the\r\nadmission of new States to the Security Council. These\r\nprocedures must be transparently democratic, for the\r\nadmission both of permanent and of non-permanent\r\nmembers, and must not in any way allow the creation of\r\nnew categories of States, which would deepen the original\r\ndifferences contained in the Charter.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): I would like to begin with a\r\nword of congratulation and admiration for the work done by\r\nAmbassadors Fredrik Wilhelm Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nAsda Jayanama of Thailand, the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil. The progress made in the Working Group is to a\r\nvery large extent the result of their tireless efforts, their\r\ndiplomatic skill, their perseverance and their patience. The\r\nGeneral Assembly is thus given the opportunity to discuss\r\nthe report of the Working Group (A/50/47 and Add.1) and\r\nto deliberate on the progress made thus far.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is one of the most\r\nimportant reforms needed in the United Nations system. It\r\nis also one of the most sensitive reforms, and it is most\r\nclearly overdue.\r\nThe reasons for the needed reform of the Security\r\nCouncil have been stated and restated many times. As a\r\nresult, consensus has been practically achieved on the\r\nunderstanding that the Security Council must be expanded\r\nand its working methods improved.\r\nAll this is necessary in order to give the Security\r\nCouncil a more representative character, more support\r\namong the United Nations Members and a higher level of\r\nlegitimacy. Furthermore, the right kind of expansion\r\nwould strengthen the effectiveness of the Security Council\r\nand contribute to the authority of the United Nations in\r\ngeneral.\r\nI do not wish to present the views of Slovenia on the\r\nquestion of reform of the Security Council in detail at this\r\nstage. We explained our views in some detail on many\r\noccasions in the Working Group. Furthermore, our basic\r\npositions are represented among the submissions by\r\nMember States and groups of Member States on\r\npages 68-71 of the English text of last year’s report\r\n(A/49/965). Slovenia joined a group of Member States\r\nwith similar views and continues to hold those basic\r\nviews reflected in the document mentioned.\r\nLet me only mention that Slovenia is among those\r\nMember States that favour an increase in both categories\r\nof members of the Security Council, permanent and non-\r\npermanent. An increase of up to five additional permanent\r\nseats would be appropriate. Such an increase should take\r\ninto account the need for regional representativeness and\r\nthe willingness and the capacity of the candidates for new\r\npermanent seats to contribute to the global maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. As stated on earlier\r\noccasions, Slovenia sees Germany and Japan among the\r\ncandidates for new permanent seats.\r\nFurthermore, there should be an appropriate increase\r\nin non-permanent membership. We believe that a Security\r\nCouncil composed of a total number of up to 25 members\r\nwould be adequately representative and would, at the\r\nsame time, enhance the possibilities for effective action of\r\nthe Council on behalf of all Member States.\r\nWe also believe that the rule of non-eligibility of a\r\nretiring non-permanent member of the Security Council\r\nshould remain as a necessary safeguard against any form\r\nof indirect or de facto permanence in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn the area of improvement of methods of work, we\r\ncontinue to favour all those improvements which\r\nstrengthen the transparency of the work of the Security\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nCouncil and create closer cooperation between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\r\nAs we read this year’s report of the Working Group,\r\nand as we recall the discussions preceding the finalization\r\nof the report, we clearly recognize that further progress\r\nneeds to be made. We cannot be satisfied with what has\r\nbeen achieved so far. Last year there was still a great deal\r\nof repetition, and many general statements were made\r\nwhich did not lead to a genuine exchange of views. As\r\nrecognized in paragraph 23 of the report, it also became\r\nclear that a number of Member States were not ready to\r\ntake final positions on the questions of the size and\r\ncomposition of the Security Council because of the\r\ninterlinkages between the size and composition and other\r\nmatters in the mandate of the Working Group. Hence the\r\nfeeling that not enough progress has yet been made.\r\nOn the other hand, however, we see in the report of\r\nthe Working Group several new elements which require\r\ncareful discussion in the present session of the General\r\nAssembly and further elaboration in the context of the\r\nnegotiations to follow, next year. Let me address a few of\r\nthem.\r\nIn paragraph 20 of the report we find reference to a\r\nconsiderable convergence of views on the question of the\r\nmethods of work of the Security Council and to the fact\r\nthat the current improvements in the working methods of\r\nthe Council have been encouraged by discussions in the\r\nWorking Group. This is a very welcome evolution.\r\nWe would like to encourage those innovations made\r\nthis year in the work of the Security Council which enhance\r\nthe cooperation between the Council and the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations. The practice of holding\r\nopen orientation debates, based on a concept originally\r\npresented by France, has had a successful beginning, and\r\nwe would like to encourage the Security Council to\r\ncontinue with it. In addition to providing an opportunity for\r\nthe United Nations Member States to participate in the\r\ndiscussion preceding the decision-making stage in the\r\nSecurity Council, this new practice has also helped clarify\r\nthe distinction between debates, which can benefit from the\r\nvariety of views expressed by Member States, and the\r\nnegotiation of resolutions which remain the responsibility\r\nof the members of the Security Council.\r\nWe suggest that the Working Group continue to\r\nexplore the possibility of involving States which are not\r\nmembers of the Security Council in the work of the\r\nCouncil at the discussion stage. In that regard, useful ideas\r\nhave been suggested in the working papers by the Czech\r\nRepublic and by Argentina and New Zealand. These\r\npapers are mentioned in the report, in paragraph 22, and\r\nwe would like them to be discussed further at a\r\nsubsequent stage of the work of the Working Group.\r\nThe sections of the report devoted to the issues of\r\nthe size and composition of the Security Council and on\r\nits decision-making reveal the difficulties which still need\r\nto be resolved.\r\nIn addition to this we are reminded, in paragraph 24\r\nof the report, of the implications of an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council for equitable geographical distribution.\r\nIndeed, this Charter requirement might be affected,\r\ndepending on the final agreement on the total increase in\r\nthe number of members of the Security Council, and\r\ncareful calculation will be necessary before final\r\nagreement is reached in order to ensure that all regional\r\ngroups, including, in particular, that of Eastern Europe,\r\nwhose membership in the past few years has doubled in\r\nnumber, are adequately represented. The same care should\r\nbe given to ensuring the adequate representation of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThis question shows that further discussions and\r\nnegotiations concerning the expansion of non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council will have to take care\r\nof certain aspects of the wider problem of expansion\r\nwhich were less visible at earlier stages.\r\nThe main question, however, remains whether the\r\nexpansion of the size of the Security Council should take\r\nplace only in the category of non-permanent seats or\r\nshould encompass both permanent and non-permanent\r\nseats. While the opinions on this question remain divided,\r\nit is important to note that innovative approaches have\r\nbeen suggested and are mentioned in paragraph 27 of the\r\nreport before us. We support the proposal for two\r\nregional permanent seats for Africa proposed in the\r\nAfrican common position, and we noted that in his\r\nstatement yesterday, the Permanent Representative of\r\nKenya emphasized the importance of that proposal. We\r\nthink that this proposal should be given particularly\r\ncareful attention at a subsequent stage of the work on the\r\nreform of the Security Council. We also believe that other\r\nproposals of this kind should be studied with a view to\r\nascertaining to what extent the concept of regional\r\nrotation can meet the needs of different regions.\r\nIn this context, I wish to refer to a point made\r\nyesterday by the Permanent Representative of Germany,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nwho mentioned in his statement that several States\r\nexpressed support both for the creation of new permanent\r\nseats and also for the Italian proposal. He then said that this\r\ncould be understood as a desire to combine the principles\r\nof permanent regional representation and rotation, leading\r\nto permanent regional seats as a possible solution to the\r\nproblem of selecting permanent members from the three\r\nregions concerned.\r\nI think that this point is very interesting. It contains an\r\napproach that certainly needs to be discussed further. It\r\nsuggests a certain convergence of the different approaches\r\nmentioned so far in the Working Group, and I believe that\r\nthe Working Group should give it due attention during the\r\nnext stage of its work.\r\nAnother — and perhaps the most important — aspect\r\nof the question of expansion of the category of permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council relates to the veto, which,\r\nin addition to permanence, is the main factor characterizing\r\nthe status of permanent members.\r\nWe note with regret that the Working Group did not\r\nmake much progress with respect to the veto. As mentioned\r\nin paragraph 31 of the report, in the course of discussions\r\nmany proposals were made with respect to limitations on\r\nthe veto, and were widely supported. Given the importance\r\nand the inherent complexity of the subject, it is natural that\r\nopposition was expressed. However, it is worrying that the\r\nopposition expressed did not allow for any further\r\ndiscussion. That opposition was very clear and blunt, and\r\ndid not indicate any readiness for negotiation. This is\r\ndisturbing because the whole question of the nature and\r\nquality of the reform of the Security Council hinges on the\r\nissue of the veto. We therefore appeal to all to give\r\nparticular attention to the question of the veto at the\r\nsubsequent stage of work and to explore the possibilities of\r\nlimiting its scope and use in a reformed Security Council.\r\nIn this context, we wish to draw attention to the last\r\nsentence in paragraph 31 of the report, which refers to an\r\nimportant concept: non-discrimination. We believe that the\r\nmeaning of this concept, as it might relate to various\r\nmodels of expansion of the permanent membership, must be\r\nfully explored. In our view, all the permanent members of\r\na reformed Security Council should have equal status. To\r\nmake this possible, the scope and use of the veto ought to\r\nbe limited for all permanent members. Some specific\r\nproposals as to how that could be done have already been\r\nmade in the Working Group. Others may follow. They\r\nshould all be given careful consideration and the advantage\r\nof a more genuine dialogue than has been the case so far.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express once again\r\nour appreciation for the work done so far by the two\r\nVice-Chairmen of the Working Group. We greatly\r\nappreciate the work done by the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fiftieth session, who was also Chairman\r\nof the Working Group. We are convinced that your own\r\nrole, Mr. President, in the subsequent stage of the work\r\nof the working Group will be extremely important. A\r\ngreat deal of time has been spent on this issue, and we\r\nhope that in 1997 the work of the Working Group will be\r\nsuccessfully concluded.\r\nMr. Campbell (Ireland): The report to the General\r\nAssembly of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council contains a full\r\naccount of the discussions that have taken place since the\r\nbeginning of the year. The annex that accompanies the\r\nreport gives an indication of the richness and depth of the\r\nideas and proposals presented by many delegations to the\r\nWorking Group. I pay tribute to the Vice-Chairmen, who\r\nhave so patiently and skilfully steered our work. We look\r\nforward to the energy and authority that you,\r\nMr. President, will bring to the Working Group in support\r\nof their efforts.\r\nThe position of my delegation on the principal issues\r\nof substance has not changed since I addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly on this agenda item almost a year ago.\r\nI stated then that, on the basis of certain fundamental\r\npoints of principle, we would take a flexible attitude to\r\nvarious aspects of the issues as they evolve, giving full\r\nconsideration to the views of other Members. We\r\ncontinue to support enlargement of the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories to enhance the effectiveness of\r\nthe Council and provide more equitable geographic\r\nrepresentation. In addition to supporting seats for\r\nGermany and Japan — countries which many, including\r\nourselves, see as appropriate candidates for permanent\r\nseats in terms of the outreach of their economic and\r\npolitical status — we support new permanent seats for\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. From\r\nthe outset we have stated our view that curtailment of the\r\nveto — an issue on which the Permanent Representative\r\nof Slovenia has just spoken with much authority — and\r\nperiodic review should be intrinsic elements of any\r\noverall solution.\r\nWe have also supported the proposals put forward,\r\nand in some cases already endorsed by the Security\r\nCouncil, to improve the working methods and\r\ntransparency of the work of the Council. In this regard,\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nwe have found the proposal by the Czech Republic for a\r\nnew interpretation of Article 31 to be particularly\r\nconstructive and worthy of serious consideration by the\r\nCouncil. These are not secondary reforms. Together with\r\nenlargement of the Council, they will greatly strengthen\r\nunderstanding of and confidence in the Council’s authority\r\nthrough a greater openness in the Security Council’s\r\nrelationship with the general membership.\r\nParticipation in the debate last year and careful study\r\nof the proposals contained in the annex to the report of the\r\nWorking Group have given me the impression that our\r\napproach, which we put forward together with a number of\r\nlike-minded countries, is shared by a reasonably large\r\nnumber of delegations. However, as we all know, on a\r\nnumber of fundamental issues there is as yet no\r\nconsensus — to put it no more strongly than that.\r\nWhen the Working Group next meets to plan its\r\nprogramme of work for the fifty-first session, it will be\r\nfaced with an important choice: whether to proceed as\r\nbefore with a series of scripted exchanges on the principal\r\nissues of Security Council reform, all of which are listed in\r\nconsiderable detail in the annex to the report before us, or\r\nwhether to accept that, unless we inject a new sense of\r\nurgency into the work of this Working Group, and perhaps\r\ninto the reform process in general, the process is in danger\r\nof running out of steam.\r\nIf the Working Group takes the first course, without\r\nbeing more precise about its objectives, a year from now\r\nwe may have a report that is little altered from the one\r\nbefore us today. If, however, we concede that new\r\nmomentum is required, we will have to address seriously\r\nthe ways in which work should develop next year to best\r\neffect. We would need to identify ways of narrowing the\r\ndifferences that now separate us. This would mean moving\r\nfrom argument, analysis and debate towards a plane on\r\nwhich the first stages of negotiation might commence.\r\nIt is probably realistic to surmise that progress on the\r\nissues under consideration in the Working Group will be\r\ninfluenced by wider factors that can encourage solutions or\r\notherwise. Having said that, however, I should say that\r\nconditionality is not on our agenda, and we should explore\r\nevery avenue in the Working Group to get the maximum\r\nresults achievable in the common interest.\r\nTo give fresh impetus to the next stage of our work,\r\nwe should make use of all the established instruments of\r\nUnited Nations practice that are available to us. In addition\r\nto formal sessions of the Working Group, these would\r\ninclude open-ended informal consultations and perhaps\r\nsome brainstorming sessions on certain of the more\r\ncomplex issues. We believe that we should be flexible\r\nabout informal efforts to bring views closer together as\r\nlong as overall transparency in our work is respected so\r\nas to maintain confidence in the process.\r\nIt seemed clear to us from the Group’s discussion at\r\nthe last session that papers or non-papers from the Chair\r\ncan be particularly helpful in focusing discussion and\r\navoiding directionless debate. We recognize that this is\r\nnot an easy task and that it is only feasible if confidence\r\nand cooperation are forthcoming from all delegations. But\r\nif there were a greater readiness to use this approach, the\r\npotential for progress would be widened in our view.\r\nMy delegation will encourage working methods to\r\nmove things forward with general support. We look\r\nforward to participating actively in the work of the Group\r\nduring the fifty-first session and hope that we can make\r\ndecisive progress in reaching solutions to the issues which\r\nwe have now been addressing for over three years.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): The Republic of\r\nKorea has, with keen interest, been actively engaged in\r\nthe important deliberations of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand is pleased to join today’s debate on agenda item 47.\r\nThe modernization of the Security Council is a\r\ncritical issue of our time and a challenge to which the\r\ninternational community must rise. The ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to formulate a credible peace and security\r\nagenda for the next century will depend greatly upon our\r\naccomplishments in that undertaking. Therefore, this\r\ndaunting task must be addressed earnestly and with\r\nprudence. Throughout the reform process, the Republic of\r\nKorea has maintained a consistent position and one that\r\nwe should like to reaffirm on this occasion.\r\nFirst and foremost, we support the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council. That is clearly warranted in the light of\r\nthe dramatically changed character of international\r\nrelations as well as the substantial increase in United\r\nNations membership over the past decades. If the Security\r\nCouncil is to become more legitimate, credible and\r\neffective as the principal organ responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, it must\r\nbe more representative of today’s world.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nSecond, we have stressed that in enlarging the Security\r\nCouncil, particular caution should be exercised against\r\ntaking any decision that would empower a select few\r\nMember States by giving them a privileged and irreversible\r\nstatus. We believe that such a move would run counter to\r\nthe trend of democratization and further undermine the\r\nadaptability of the Organization to the continually evolving\r\ninternational environment.\r\nThe notions of “permanency” and “the veto” have\r\nbecome rather outdated. Despite the reality of the current\r\npermanent members, we are not yet convinced by the\r\nargument that without an increase in permanent\r\nmembership, Security Council reform would be neither\r\nbalanced nor complete. This cannot be reconciled with the\r\nnew era of democratization, global cooperation and\r\ninterdependence.\r\nThird, we support the expansion of the non-permanent\r\nmembership. We are pleased to note that this year’s report\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group documents the position\r\nof a large number of Member States, and states that:\r\n“The proposal that, in case of no agreement on the\r\nincrease of other categories of membership, expansion\r\nshould take place only, for the time being, in the non-\r\npermanent category received wide support.” (A/50/47,\r\npara. 29)\r\nAs to a concrete modality for enlargement of the non-\r\npermanent category, we are open to a variety of proposals,\r\nincluding the simple addition of several non-permanent\r\nmembers or schemes providing more frequent rotation. We\r\nbelieve that the Working Group must concentrate on\r\nworking out a modality for non-permanent expansion that\r\nwould be acceptable to the general membership, rather than\r\nfocusing on a highly divisive and controversial issue,\r\nnamely, whether or not permanent members should be\r\nadded. In this connection, I agree with the views of the\r\nItalian Ambassador that we stand at the crossroads, leading\r\neither to new permanent seats or to new elected seats, and\r\nI emphasize, elected seats.\r\nAs regards the question of new elected seats, we do\r\nnot confine our thinking to the current two-year term for\r\nnon-permanent members. For instance, we might consider\r\nthe addition of several new non-permanent members,\r\nperhaps as many as eight, with tenures longer than two\r\nyears, such as a four-year term, which would be elected in\r\nexactly the same manner as the current non-permanent\r\nmembers. The equal eligibility of all Member States for that\r\nnew opportunity could circumvent the strong conceptual\r\nobjections that any creation of a preselected and\r\nprivileged group of countries would incur. This can also\r\nenhance the overall representativity and credibility of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFourth, with regard to the current decision-making\r\nprocess of the Security Council, we believe that an\r\noverhaul of the veto system is in order. While we\r\nrecognize the growing trend away from exercise of the\r\nveto since the collapse of the cold war, many delegations\r\nexpressed the opinion during the Working Group’s\r\ndiscussions that any Security Council reform package\r\nmust include the improvement of that undemocratic\r\nsystem. To that end, we support the idea of\r\ncircumscribing the scope of the veto power to Security\r\nCouncil actions taken under Chapter VII of the Charter,\r\nas has been endorsed by so many countries, including the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement. In this connection, we take note\r\nof the Brazilian Ambassador’s interesting proposal to\r\nallow permanent members to cast a “no” vote without\r\nvetoing.\r\nAnother important and closely related veto issue is\r\nwhether it will be extended beyond the current permanent\r\nmembers. It seems entirely illogical and rather self-\r\ndefeating to allow the proliferation of veto holders while\r\nat the same time trying to minimize the overuse or abuse\r\nof the veto. We firmly believe that the privileged group\r\nof veto holders, endorsed 50 years ago as a special\r\nexception to the principle of sovereign equality, must not\r\nbe enlarged.\r\nAnd fifth, we support the further improvement of the\r\nSecurity Council’s working methods with a view to\r\nenhancing transparency and ensuring greater interaction\r\nbetween non-members and members of the Council, while\r\nnot sacrificing its operational efficiency. In this context,\r\nwe welcome the important progress made to that effect in\r\nrecent years, such as regular briefings by the President of\r\nthe Security Council to the general membership, more\r\nfrequent orientation debates, and consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries. These positive initiatives should be\r\nconsolidated and developed further.\r\nThe foregoing views are of particular importance to\r\nmy delegation and will continue to be our guiding\r\nprinciples in the common pursuit of Security Council\r\nreform. We sincerely hope these views can evolve and\r\ndevelop by virtue of constructive and enlightening input\r\nfrom other delegations.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nIt is understandable that each delegation will have a\r\ndifferent opinion as to where exactly we stand on the\r\nquestion of Security Council reform, and just what progress\r\nwas achieved by the Working Group during the Assembly’s\r\nlast session. Some see none at all, while others observe\r\nsomething tangible. For our part, we recognize at least two\r\nsignificant developments on the issue of enlargement.\r\nOne is that the so-called “quick-fix” solution has been\r\ndeclared off the table. This year’s report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group states:\r\n“In the event that there is agreement for an increase in\r\nthe permanent membership, an increase only by\r\nindustrialized countries would be widely regarded as\r\nunacceptable.” (A/50/47, para. 26)\r\nGiven this convergence of opinion, we may now be\r\nleft primarily with two options: either to increase the non-\r\npermanent category only in its broader sense; or to expand\r\npermanent membership to include the developing world\r\nalong with additional non-permanent members.\r\nThree years of experience in the Working Group tells\r\nus that the former option is less divisive in nature and\r\nwould be easier to bring about and that the latter would be\r\nextremely difficult to realize in the light of the complexities\r\nsurrounding the selection of new permanent members. The\r\nidea of permanent regional representation or permanent\r\nregional rotating seats was floated and discussed during the\r\npast session of the Working Group as a way of bringing the\r\ndeveloping world into permanent membership. However, it\r\nallows only — and I emphasize the word “only” — the\r\nindustrialized nations to join permanent membership in the\r\ntraditional sense, leaving the developing world in a state of\r\ngreat uncertainty.\r\nMoreover, given the complex regional dynamics of the\r\ndeveloping world, I wonder how such a formula could\r\nwork. I note that several delegations have already\r\nexpressed, rather convincingly, conceptual objections to this\r\napparent oxymoron. It was interesting to hear from the\r\nMexican Ambassador that non-permanent members have\r\nalready been elected to seats “permanently” assigned to\r\neach region.\r\nAnother development is that even those who support\r\nan increase in permanent membership accept the\r\nproposition that the word “permanent” should not imply\r\n“eternal”, a point made continually by delegations with\r\nstrong reservations on that increase. We note with interest\r\nthat Germany, a nation widely regarded as a potential direct\r\nbeneficiary of an increase in permanent membership, put\r\nforward the idea that new permanent members should not\r\nbe eternal but subject to periodic review with a 15-year\r\ninterval in the form of a General Assembly vote.\r\nAlthough its proposal as a whole may not enjoy\r\nbroad support, it echoes my delegation’s repeated\r\nadvocacy that the qualifications of Security Council\r\nmembers must be checked against time and that\r\ndemocratic review in the form of elections is essential.\r\nFurthermore, the combination of “permanent” and\r\n“periodic review” might be seen as having something in\r\ncommon with the mix of “non-permanent” and “longer\r\ntenure”. We take some encouragement from the fact that\r\nthe conceptual gap is not necessarily unbridgeable. If\r\ncommon ground exists, it would be worthwhile to explore\r\nand pursue it. In our view, longer term non-permanent\r\nmembership is worthy of further consideration.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation looks forward to\r\ncontributing to the deliberations on this important issue\r\nunder your able leadership, Sir. We also wish to assure\r\nyou and all other colleagues here today that my\r\ndelegation is ready to work together on any new\r\nconstructive initiatives or proposals which may lead us to\r\na consensus on the reform and restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey): The Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Turkey stated at the general debate almost a\r\nmonth ago that, as we embark on the second half-century\r\nof our Organization, it is appropriate for the international\r\ncommunity to reassess the ways and means by which we\r\ncan give new impetus to the efforts aimed at building a\r\nbetter and more secure future for all humankind.\r\nThe challenges that the United Nations will face in\r\nthe twenty-first century will probably be greater than ever\r\nbefore. Hence, the United Nations has to adapt itself\r\nwithout delay to changing times and circumstances. It is\r\non this premise that we support the ongoing reform\r\nprocess within the United Nations. Secretary-General\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, on the occasion of United Nations\r\nDay on 24 October, aptly stated that:\r\n“Let us remember that the United Nations\r\nfounded in 1945 was an unfinished edifice. ...\r\n“The United Nations is a work in progress. Just\r\nas our predecessors strove to give us a world\r\norganization capable of dealing with the challenges\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nof the age, so our task is to prepare the United\r\nNations of the twenty-first century.” (SGSM/6094)\r\nIn this respect, streamlining, rationalizing, revitalizing\r\nand restructuring the United Nations system and its work\r\nare the widely accepted components needed to bring about\r\na more effective, responsive, representative, democratic and\r\naccountable world Organization. These modifications, which\r\nare currently under intense consideration, will determine the\r\neffectiveness and, indeed, the validity and continued\r\nrelevance of the United Nations in the years ahead.\r\nThe central issue before us is the enhancement of the\r\nrepresentative character of the Security Council. The new\r\ninternational political environment requires the\r\ndemocratization of the Council. Since January 1994, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil has been formulating a set of guidelines for the\r\nongoing reform process.\r\nTwo main aspects of our work require equal attention.\r\nWe have to enhance the representative character of the\r\nCouncil and democratize its method of work.\r\nMr. Nsanze (Burundi), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nOn the first point, the enhancement of the\r\nrepresentative nature of the Council cannot be confined\r\nmerely to a quantitative expansion of its size. The\r\nmodalities of the enlargement should also be elaborated.\r\nWe do not think that an increase in the overall number of\r\nseats alone will suffice to ensure more equitable and\r\nrepresentative participation in the work of the Council. The\r\nenlargement should be coupled with a fair system of\r\nworkable rotation. In this context, we believe that the\r\nrevised proposal for the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil submitted by Italy on 12 June 1996, which is\r\ncontained in document A/50/47/Add.1, annex IX, and our\r\nposition paper of 15 September 1995, which is contained in\r\ndocument A/49/965, annex V, merit careful consideration.\r\nTurkey strongly favours a genuine and comprehensive\r\nreform. Since the establishment of the Working Group by\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 48/26, we have participated\r\nactively in every stage of this process. Turkey is against\r\ncontinuation of the status quo. We have to be mindful of\r\nthe fact that this unique organ has to be able to evolve so\r\nthat it will efficiently face the uncertainties and challenges\r\nthat lie ahead.\r\nThe recent report of the Working Group on the\r\nreform of the Security Council (A/50/47) lays out the\r\nfacts. Proposals for an increase in the non-permanent\r\nmembership only, including proposals on more frequent\r\nelections for a number of Member States, as proposed by\r\nItaly, Mexico and Turkey in annex V of document\r\nA/49/965, received both support and objections. The\r\nproposal by the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nthat, in case of no agreement on the increase of other\r\ncategories of membership, expansion should take place\r\nonly, for the time being, in the non-permanent category\r\nreceived wide support. In the event that there is\r\nagreement for an increase in the permanent membership,\r\nan increase only by industrialized countries would be\r\nwidely regarded as unacceptable. The concept of regional\r\nrotation of permanent seats received both support and\r\nobjections.\r\nConsequently, it seems to our delegation that an\r\nincrease in non-permanent seats would seem to be the\r\nmost natural course of action. Turkey believes that the\r\nWorking Group should concentrate its efforts on the\r\npoints that received the widest support.\r\nThe proposal introduced by Spain on 4 June 1996\r\nwith regard to the criteria for the non-permanent\r\nrotational seats, which is contained in document\r\nA/50/47/Add.1, annex VIII, deserves careful\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe agree that the contribution of military, police and\r\ncivilian personnel to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations should be the first criterion; the next criterion\r\ncould be the financial contributions disbursed to the\r\nOrganization’s budget; and the third criterion should be\r\nthe population of Member States. We believe that these\r\ncriteria, with the flexibility to update them, will address\r\nthe needs, expectations and changing conditions of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe improvement of the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council is an equally important aspect of the\r\nreform process. In this respect, the aim should be to make\r\nthe Council transparent, responsive, inclusive and\r\naccountable. The aspects which we would like to see the\r\nSecurity Council adopt are included in the working paper\r\nsubmitted by Argentina and New Zealand on 17 May\r\n1996, which is contained in document A/50/47/Add.1,\r\nannex VI.\r\nIn this context, we would like to reiterate the\r\nimportance of transparency. To this end, it should not\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nonly be a regular practice, but a requirement, for the\r\nSecurity Council to hold consultations with interested\r\nparties before decisions are made, especially decisions that\r\naffect them directly.\r\nThe issue of the reform of the Security Council no\r\ndoubt requires comprehensive and cautious analysis.\r\nReform in the financial area, which is being taken up\r\nseparately, is itself important. However, it would be\r\nunrealistic to assume that financial reform alone would be\r\nsufficient to make the United Nations better equipped for\r\nthe challenges that lie ahead. In this context, I would like\r\nto emphasize that with only short-term goals in mind,\r\nprogress and success will be at risk. At this point in time,\r\nwhen we embark upon the vitally important path of\r\nreforming the Security Council, we have to move carefully\r\nbut resolutely.\r\nMr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nMy statement will be very brief. Its sole objective is to\r\nexpress France’s continued interest in the work begun three\r\nyears ago on the expansion of the Security Council. This\r\nimportant endeavour, upon which we embarked in 1993 in\r\nthe awareness that it would entail difficult negotiations,\r\nmust be brought to a successful conclusion. Not to succeed,\r\nor not to do so within a reasonable time limit, would be a\r\nblow to multilateralism. We must — and indeed we\r\nwant — to achieve reform, in order to enable the organs\r\nestablished by the Charter of the United Nations to live up\r\nto their full potential.\r\nResolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993 laid the\r\nframework for efforts to expand the Council, and it\r\ncontinues to provide the mandate of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil. We need both to draw the necessary conclusions\r\nfrom the increase in the membership of the United\r\nNations, particularly among the developing countries, and\r\nto take into account the other factors that have affected the\r\nevolution of international relations.\r\nWe must draw a clear conclusion from this mandate:\r\nthe number of members of the Security Council must be\r\nincreased, but in a way that will not prevent it from\r\nresponding swiftly to crisis situations that pose a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. For that reason we feel\r\nthat a few more than 20 members should be the maximum.\r\nThe increase should be designed to ensure better\r\nrepresentation of developing countries in the Council. In\r\nour view, this presence of the developing countries should\r\nbe reflected in both categories of Council members: the\r\nnon-permanent and the permanent members. The general\r\ndebate has shown that this idea enjoys very broad support.\r\nFurthermore, we can all see that certain States today\r\nhave an international influence which should be exercised\r\nin a more sustained and official way in the United\r\nNations. This is the case with Germany and Japan, which\r\nhave our full support on this point, as well as the support\r\nof many other States. France also believes that the large\r\nStates of the South should have an appropriate place.\r\nFinally, we readily acknowledge that no geographical\r\ngroup should be excluded from the expansion effort. All\r\ngroups of countries whose numbers have increased are\r\njustified in demanding not to be left out.\r\nWith regard to the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, many steps have been taken over the last three\r\nyears to make them both more rational and more\r\ntransparent. We think that we should stick to the\r\npragmatic approach followed so far, which has yielded\r\ngood results, even though they can certainly be taken\r\nfurther and consolidated. We have managed to avoid the\r\npitfall of seeking to freeze the status quo; let us continue\r\non this path.\r\nDuring the general debate in the Assembly at this\r\nsession, we noted that many speakers expressed the hope\r\nthat there would be no excessive delay in taking the\r\ndecisions necessary to complete the reform process in the\r\nUnited Nations. Everyone knows that the question of the\r\nSecurity Council’s composition is a central element in the\r\nreform process. Agreement on increasing the Council’s\r\nmembership is therefore an indispensable component of\r\nany true reform.\r\nThe initial positions of each of us are now well\r\nknown, and their repetition would serve no useful\r\npurpose. We must therefore set ourselves the goal of\r\nconcluding negotiations within a reasonably brief time-\r\nframe. France, for its part, is prepared to contribute to\r\nthat process.\r\nMr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): I would like to begin\r\nby commending the Chairman and the co-Vice-Chairmen\r\nof the Open-Ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nrelated to Security Council reform for their tireless efforts\r\nduring the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. They\r\nhave my delegation’s full support as they continue to\r\nsteer the Working Group in the discharge of its mandate.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nMy delegation would also like to associate itself with\r\nthe statement made by the delegation of Colombia on\r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The\r\nMovement has made concrete proposals on all aspects of\r\nthe reform and restructuring of the Security Council, which\r\nwe hope will be a positive contribution to the building of\r\nconsensus on this vital issue.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Working Group, which\r\nreflects accurately the debate that took place in the Working\r\nGroup during the past Assembly session. The international\r\ncommunity had hoped that the Working Group would have\r\nridden on the wave of the jubilee of the Organization to\r\narrive at an acceptable formula for reform and expansion.\r\nWe are all aware that this did not happen, and the process\r\nis taking too long to yield even the first fruits. In our view,\r\nhowever, the Working Group has to continue until a\r\nsolution is found to make the Security Council transparent,\r\ndemocratic and accountable to the wider membership of the\r\nOrganization. The imbalance in the Council has therefore\r\nto be redressed.\r\nOnly a month ago, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\r\nZimbabwe addressed the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly and reiterated the urgent need to ensure that\r\ndeveloping countries are adequately represented in the\r\npermanent category. The Minister stated:\r\n“We in Africa maintain that the present arrangement\r\nwhere Africa and Latin America have no permanent\r\nrepresentatives on the Security Council, while Asia\r\nhas only one, is unjust and antidemocratic and must\r\nnot be allowed to continue. Those three regions should\r\neach have at least two permanent seats, with\r\nincumbents enjoying the same rights and privileges as\r\nthe present permanent members. Additional non-\r\npermanent seats should also be allocated to each of\r\nthose regions so as to ensure equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation proportionate to the numerical strength\r\nof each region in this Organization.” (Official Records\r\nof the General Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 10th meeting, p. 17)\r\nAs is evident from that quotation, Zimbabwe is\r\ncommitted to the common African position, as clearly\r\nstated by the Organization of African Unity. It is\r\ninconceivable that, in an era when the virtues of democracy\r\nand good governance at the national level are being\r\npreached, such democracy is not applied at the level of the\r\nUnited Nations and that an entire continent of 54 Member\r\nStates is not represented in the Security Council in the\r\npermanent category. A Council where all regions are\r\nequitably represented will, no doubt, not only enhance the\r\ncredibility and legitimacy of one of the principal organs\r\nof the United Nations, but also enhance the credibility of\r\nthose who champion the ideals of democracy in human\r\nrelations.\r\nThe Security Council, as at present constituted,\r\nempowers only a few Members of the world body, who\r\nwere accorded this privileged status presumably by virtue\r\nof their victory during a war fought half a century ago. In\r\nthat war, the peoples of the African continent made\r\nenormous contributions to the eventual defeat of fascism\r\nand Nazism. Yet today it is the handful of permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council who continue to wield\r\npowers that enable them to take or block decisions that\r\naffect the destiny of the vast majority of Member States\r\nof the Organization. It is our contention that the Security\r\nCouncil, in the post-cold-war era, should not continue to\r\nbe used as an instrument to serve the interests of a very\r\nfew powerful countries. It is also our contention that in\r\norder to enhance the credibility and universal character of\r\nthe United Nations, the visibility and vital role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as the highest decision-making body\r\nof the Organization, have to be highlighted and\r\nreinforced.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement presented a position\r\npaper on the veto that was supported by an overwhelming\r\nnumber of delegations. The veto is a relic of the cold war.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement’s proposal is clear. The\r\nscope of the veto has to be curtailed and restricted to only\r\nthose matters that fall under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nEventually, the veto has to be abolished altogether. It is\r\nclear from the discussions that took place in the Working\r\nGroup on this subject that the permanent five are reluctant\r\nto discuss this subject seriously. Their intransigent\r\nposture, if it persists, will be an obstacle to the reform\r\nprocess. We therefore appeal to them to review their\r\nposition on this vital issue.\r\nWhen negotiations on the reform and expansion of\r\nthe Security Council commenced three years ago, we\r\nwere told that the reform of the Council’s working\r\nmethods would constitute the so-called early harvest.\r\nHowever, the posture assumed by some Council members\r\nin recent days has blighted the prospect for such an early\r\nharvest. We applaud President Razali in his efforts to\r\nensure that there is transparency and accountability in the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council. We note, however, that some members\r\nof the Council were reluctant to see consultations being\r\ncarried out between the presidents of the General\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. We are convinced that\r\ngenuine consultations between the Council and the rest of\r\nthe membership will go a long way towards enhancing its\r\ndecision-making capability as well as its moral credibility.\r\nWe are told that the Council is in the process of gradually\r\nreforming itself, and also that it is the master of its own\r\nprocedures. Yet with increasing cogency the question is\r\nbeing asked whether the much-vaunted reforms are not just\r\ncosmetic. Should the pace and content of change be left\r\nentirely to the five permanent members, to the exclusion of\r\nthe rest of the 185 Member States of the Organization?\r\nIn this regard, my delegation would like to support the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement proposal to finalize the provisional\r\nrules of procedure — a step that will certainly grant legal\r\nweight to the decisions taken by the Council. In calling for\r\nthe formalization of these measures, we are not advocating\r\nthat this be done at the expense of other equally important\r\naspects of the reform exercise, such as the expansion. We\r\nbelieve that progress on both fronts can and should be\r\nachieved simultaneously, as a package. The current debate\r\nshould provide a legal and binding framework for the\r\ncollaboration between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, with ultimate authority vested in the General\r\nAssembly, as is stated in the Charter.\r\nMr. Fowler (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me first to mention that my delegation looks forward\r\nto working with President Razali in his capacity as\r\nChairman of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. We are also grateful for\r\nthe efforts this year of the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group, Ambassador Breitenstein of Finland and\r\nAmbassador Jayanama of Thailand. The General Assembly\r\ndebate on the report of the Working Group allows us the\r\nopportunity to review the results of our discussions this past\r\nyear and to consider how to approach our mandate when\r\nwe resume our efforts in January.\r\nWith regard to the working methods of the Council,\r\nthe report underlines the considerable time and effort we\r\nhave devoted to this subject. Delegations participated\r\nactively and a number of useful ideas were proposed, which\r\nshows the importance most of us attach to reform in this\r\narea. That reconfirms the need to ensure that this vitally\r\nimportant body grows and evolves in step with the\r\nexpansion of the global membership of our Organization\r\nand in a manner that is consistent with the challenges we\r\nface on the threshold of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe welcome the further efforts made this year to\r\nimprove the transparency, legitimacy, and effectiveness of\r\nthe Council’s activities. As a troop-contributing country,\r\nwe are particularly pleased with the enhancement of the\r\nCouncil’s mechanism for consultations with the countries\r\ninvolved. As our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lloyd\r\nAxworthy, stated during the general debate this year,\r\nCanada attaches particular importance to the need to\r\nensure meaningful participation in decision-making by\r\nthose members whose nationals — military and\r\ncivilian — are in the crossfire of the conflicts over which\r\nthe Council is deliberating.\r\nThose developments are reflected in the Presidential\r\nStatement issued on 28 March by the Council. Among its\r\nmost significant elements, the Statement requires the\r\nPresident of the Council to chair meetings with troop-\r\ncontributing nations and the Council is requested to\r\nconsult with prospective troop-contributing nations before\r\nnew operations are mounted. These changes should ensure\r\nmore direct and timely exchanges of views on vitally\r\nimportant issues of mandate, mission objectives and the\r\nadequacy of planned resources in advance of the adoption\r\nor extension of peacekeeping mandates.\r\nThanks to the enhanced deliberations of the Security\r\nCouncil, both the Council members and the troop-\r\ncontributing nations are now responsible for ensuring that\r\nthe improvements introduced are used effectively and to\r\ntheir fullest potential.\r\nAs the report and its annexes illustrate, there has\r\nbeen some progress in other areas, most notably the more\r\nfrequent use of formal orientation debates, regular\r\nbriefings for Member States on the activities of the\r\nCouncil presidency and changes making the activities of\r\nthe Council’s sanctions committees more transparent.\r\nThese, too, are welcome innovations, as they have made\r\nthe Security Council more responsive to the concerns of\r\nthe broader United Nations membership.\r\nHowever, we can and should do more. Our\r\ndiscussions this year have underlined the fact that the\r\nmajority of Member States strongly support further\r\nimprovements in the Council’s working methods and the\r\nformalization of those changes already made. One area\r\nthat merits closer attention is the participation in the work\r\nof the Council of non-Member States. In particular, those\r\nmost directly involved in or affected by an issue before\r\nthe Council should be able to participate in the Council’s\r\ndeliberations on that issue. That is the intent behind\r\nArticles 31 and 32 of the Charter, both of which need to\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nbe implemented more effectively. A number of useful ideas\r\non how to do this, including a proposal from the Czech\r\ndelegation, have been put forward.\r\nIn particular, we need a better understanding of how\r\nto act on the words in Article 31; according to which:\r\n“Any Member ... may participate, without vote,\r\nin the discussion of any question brought before the\r\nSecurity Council whenever the latter considers that the\r\ninterests of that Member are specially affected.”\r\nThere are two points to make here. First, in our view\r\nit should be understood that participation would be virtually\r\nautomatic when a Member is involved in a matter before\r\nthe Council, either as a directly affected party or as a major\r\ntroop-contributing country, especially the lead contributors.\r\nSecondly, “participation” should be understood to mean\r\ninvolvement in the informal discussions, including on draft\r\ntexts, not just being graciously allowed to make a public\r\nspeech in the Council Chamber.\r\nSome have expressed reservations to the effect that\r\nfurther reform, especially in this area, would diminish the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making capacity. However, we reject\r\nany attempt to preserve and protect the exclusivity of the\r\nCouncil, particularly that of its permanent members. Indeed,\r\nwe believe that, on the contrary, greater consultation in\r\nthese areas would allow the Council to take more informed\r\nand more appropriate action. Moreover, such changes\r\nwould, we contend, only improve the Council’s decisions\r\nand increase its credibility.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nConcerning decision-making, the focus of the Working\r\nGroup’s attention has been, of course, tightly focused on\r\nthe question of the veto. We share the view expressed by\r\nthe majority of delegations opposing any extension of the\r\nveto and supporting an urgent examination of how to limit\r\nthe current veto power and better define its scope. In\r\nparticular, we believe the current veto ought to be restricted\r\nto Security Council decisions under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter. This needs to be considered further in the Working\r\nGroup. To this end, we believe that the papers presented by\r\nMexico and Egypt on behalf of the Movement of the Non-\r\nAligned this year provide a good basis for further\r\ndiscussion.\r\nThe message from most delegations over the past year\r\nhas said very clearly that extending the veto privilege is\r\ndecidedly not the best way to deal with the very many\r\nconcerns already expressed about this issue. Any\r\nextension would exacerbate current problems, make\r\ndecision-making more difficult, potentially exclude more\r\nconflicts from the purview of the Council and, once\r\ngranted, would of course be difficult to review. In short,\r\nit would neither improve the functioning of the Council\r\nnor enhance its representative nature. Extending veto\r\nprivileges would almost certainly militate against the\r\neffectiveness of the Council in its efforts to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nConcerning the primordial matter of the size and\r\ncomposition of the Security Council, there is clear\r\nagreement in the Working Group that any formula should\r\nbe agreed by all. This principle has been the foundation\r\non which we have built all our efforts to date and, we\r\ncontend, cannot be compromised. Like others, we believe\r\nthat any expansion should be aimed at recognizing better\r\nthe contribution of Member States to the broader purposes\r\nof the Charter while also reflecting the increase in the\r\nmembership of the Organization. However, three years of\r\ndiscussion have failed to produce anything close to a\r\nconsensus on how to do this.\r\nThe main obstacle has been the question of the\r\naddition of new permanent members. The Working Group\r\nhas agonized over this from the outset. An enormous\r\namount of time and energy has been devoted to\r\nconsidering ways in which this might be done in a\r\nmanner acceptable to all. Proposals have been made and\r\nput aside. However, despite exhaustive discussions, the\r\nsubject appears to have become more difficult rather than\r\nless.\r\nAs the report makes plain, there is, first and\r\nforemost, nothing approaching a consensus on whether\r\nany expansion in permanent membership is either\r\nwarranted or acceptable. Similarly, there is no indication\r\nthat these divergences can be bridged. Even among those\r\nwho do support the addition of new permanent members,\r\nthere are differences as to how this should be done. The\r\n“quick fix” solution — the simple addition of two\r\npermanent members — has not attracted the support it\r\nneeds to be a realistic option. Other formulas have been\r\nput forward in an effort to square the circle, but these\r\nhave proved similarly problematic and are unlikely, in our\r\nassessment, to receive widespread support. One option\r\nthat received considerable attention this year is the idea of\r\nregional rotating permanent members. Variations were\r\nproposed, including one that would mix regular with\r\nrotating permanent seats. We have strong reservations\r\nabout all of these proposals. While various formulas\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nespousing the theme of rotating permanent members would\r\ncertainly enhance the status of a very select group of\r\nMember States, it remains entirely uncertain how these\r\nformulas would work and, even less, how they would\r\nbenefit the large majority of Member States.\r\nThe idea of how countries and which countries would\r\nbe selected for this new category of membership has also\r\ndefied clarification; indeed, a degree of confusion, creative\r\nor otherwise, seems to hover over this question. We are\r\nconcerned that different suggestions in this regard do not\r\naccommodate the vital requirements that all Members of the\r\nUnited Nations participate equally and transparently in the\r\nelection of all members of the Council.\r\nMost fundamentally, we share the strong concerns\r\nexpressed by others that these formulas might restrict rather\r\nthan enhance access to the Council by the majority of the\r\nUnited Nations membership. We fully appreciate the\r\nmotivations of those countries that have developed these\r\nproposals. In our view however, they are simply not the\r\nway to achieve a more representative Council.\r\nWe have indicated before that the aspirations of\r\nseveral countries to permanent member status is\r\nunderstandable. Nevertheless, it seems difficult not to\r\nconclude from our extensive discussions on this issue that\r\nthe addition of new permanent members — of whatever\r\nkind — faces hurdles that, at this time, we simply cannot\r\novercome. The deadlock on this subject is impeding our\r\nability to decide on an expanded Council membership that\r\nwill respond to the needs of all Member States. It is in\r\neffect blocking the reform that we have all agreed is needed\r\nto enable the Security Council better to reflect changing\r\ntimes and challenges.\r\nIn these circumstances, we wonder whether it might\r\nnot be easier to obtain agreement, for the present, on\r\nexpanding the Security Council in the non-permanent\r\ncategory. Agreement here ought to be easier to obtain. This\r\nwould be a first step that would not by any means preclude\r\nfuture discussion on permanent membership.\r\nAs the Canadian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lloyd\r\nAxworthy, noted before the General Assembly a month\r\nago, any expansion needs to better reflect the contribution\r\nof members to the broader purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter as well as the need for equitable geographic\r\nrepresentation. An expansion in the non-permanent category\r\nwould therefore require enhanced participation from all\r\ngeographic regions. Such an expansion would also need to\r\nbe relatively modest, perhaps 6 to 10 members, to\r\nenhance the effective functioning of the Council.\r\nTo this end, as we have indicated before, we see\r\nconsiderable merit in proposals that would expand the\r\nCouncil to allow for more frequent rotation by countries\r\nwhich more fully meet the primary requirements of\r\nArticle 23, dealing with the composition of the Council.\r\nThis is worth doing for its own sake, to better reflect the\r\nintention of the United Nations Charter. Equally\r\nimportant, however, it would reduce the number of\r\ncandidates and the strength of competition for existing\r\nnon-permanent seats. It would thereby help to ensure that\r\nmore countries had an opportunity to serve on the Council\r\nthan is now the case.\r\nThis, of course, remains but one possibility. We\r\nremain open to other formulas that would move us\r\nforward in the search for a solution likely to attract\r\nwidespread support. For instance, the possibility of a\r\nstraightforward expansion of the Council, in the non-\r\npermanent category only, for all geographic regions, just\r\nas was done in 1965, has always been an option from the\r\noutset of our deliberations. Perhaps after three years of\r\ninconclusive debate, we ought to give this option some\r\nstraightforward consideration as an alternative that meets\r\nmost countries’ objectives.\r\nI can assure the President of the Assembly and the\r\nVice-Chairmen of the Working Group of Canada’s full\r\nand active participation once the work of the Group\r\nresumes in January.\r\nMr. Wang Xuexian (China) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The reform of the United Nations is a matter of\r\nworldwide concern. At its heart is the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, which has a decisive impact on the\r\nwhole reform process of the United Nations. During the\r\nlast session of the General Assembly, the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council had further in-depth and fairly detailed\r\ndiscussions on the reform of the Council, which\r\ncontributed to enhanced mutual understanding by all\r\nparties, though no substantive progress was made on\r\nmajor issues. The Chinese delegation deems these\r\ndiscussions useful and hopes that the Working Group will\r\ncontinue to make fruitful efforts at the current session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nThe enlargement of the membership of the Council is\r\nat the core of its reform. China is in favour of its\r\nappropriate expansion. Since 1963 the United Nations\r\nmembership has increased by over one third in the wake of\r\nthe upsurge of national liberation movements and profound\r\nchanges on the international scene. However, no\r\ncorresponding change has been made to the composition of\r\nthe Council over the past 30 years.\r\nWhat is even more worrisome is that there has long\r\nbeen a serious imbalance in the composition of the Council.\r\nDeveloping countries make up more than two thirds of the\r\nUnited Nations membership. However, this reality is far\r\nfrom adequately reflected by their representation in the\r\nCouncil. This is particularly true for Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica, where there is a concentration of developing\r\ncountries. This imbalance merits our serious attention.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jiang Zemin, President of China,\r\npointed out at the Special Commemorative Meeting to mark\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of United Nations that the reform of\r\nthe United Nations should reflect the principle of balanced\r\ngeographical distribution and strengthen the position and\r\nrole of third world countries in the United Nations.\r\nAs an important component of United Nations reform,\r\nthe reform of the Council must focus on redressing\r\nimbalanced regional representation, particularly the serious\r\ninadequacy in the representation of developing countries. It\r\nmust in no way further aggravate this imbalance. Without\r\nattaining this objective, the enlargement of the Council\r\ncannot be regarded as reform in a real sense; it would be,\r\nrather, a failure to reform. Therefore, no reform plan that\r\nexcludes or discriminates against developing countries will\r\never be accepted by the general membership of the United\r\nNations, including China.\r\nI also wish to emphasize here that the Council is not\r\na club of the rich, still less a board of directors. Increasing\r\nthe membership of the Council cannot and should not\r\ndepend solely on a country’s financial contributions to the\r\nUnited Nations. What is more important is whether it has\r\na correct understanding of war and peace both from a\r\nhistorical and from a current perspective and whether it is\r\na positive factor in promoting international peace and\r\nsecurity. That is precisely why the United Nations was\r\ncreated and why the Council is entrusted with the major\r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity to free mankind from the scourge of any future war\r\nand aggression.\r\nWe are of the view that the reform of the Council is\r\nby no means simply a matter of increasing the number of\r\nmembers. It is, in the final analysis, aimed at making the\r\nCouncil a true representative of the interests of all\r\ncountries in the world, one that enjoys their trust and\r\nsupport, thus better reflecting the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter. This bears on whether the Council can\r\nbetter fulfil its responsibilities for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and enhance the authority\r\nand representativeness of its decisions.\r\nAnother important aspect of the Council’s reform is\r\nthe improvement of its working methods. This is aimed\r\nat, first, enhancing its effectiveness so that it can better\r\nfulfil its responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security entrusted by the Charter, and secondly,\r\nincreasing the transparency of its work and strengthening\r\nthe understanding of and participation in its work by the\r\ngeneral membership to show that it truly acts on behalf of\r\nMember States. At present the Council has already\r\nadopted a few measures to improve its working methods.\r\nHowever, some of them are yet to be implemented and\r\nfurther improvements are necessary.\r\nI wish particularly to nt out in this connection that\r\nthe Council’s procedure for imposing and removing\r\nsanctions is far from perfect. This has made it possible\r\nfor one or two countries, bent on having their own way,\r\nto brandish the big stick of sanctions against developing\r\ncountries in disregard of the will of the general\r\nmembership and of the suffering of the peoples of target\r\ncountries. The Council has already had quite a few\r\nlessons in this regard. We must take practical measures to\r\nredress this situation.\r\nChina has always supported and vigorously\r\npromoted improvement of the Council’s working methods\r\nand stands for strengthening the Council’s relations with\r\nthe General Assembly and other United Nations bodies,\r\nthe convening of as many open meetings as possible, the\r\nimprovement of practices regarding consultations with\r\ntroop-contributing countries, and the institution of\r\nappropriate arrangements for the parties concerned to state\r\ntheir views directly to the Council. China is ready to join\r\nthe rest of the membership for further useful discussions\r\non improving the working methods of the Council.\r\nReform of the Council involves the individual\r\ninterests of all parties. The results will also produce a\r\ntremendous impact on various aspects of the United\r\nNations. Given its complexity and arduousness, reform\r\ncannot be expected to be completed overnight. Moreover,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nthe Council’s composition, working methods and decision-\r\nmaking procedures came about against a specific historical\r\nbackground. We must therefore keep pace with the times\r\nwhile maintaining a historical perspective in discussing\r\nplans to reform the Council.\r\nChina hopes that the general membership will conduct\r\nfull and patient discussions and consultations on various\r\nreform plans and recommendations in a spirit of fairness,\r\nopenness, transparency and broad consideration. All\r\ndecisions should reflect to the maximum the requests of the\r\ngeneral membership and should be made on the basis of\r\nconsensus to the extent possible. Only in this way can\r\nfurther imbalance be avoided and the true objective of\r\nCouncil reform be attained.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana): I join others in extending our\r\ndelegation’s gratitude for the work carried out by the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil during the fiftieth session of the Assembly. We\r\nalso express our appreciation to the co-Vice-Chairmen for\r\ntheir efficiency in guiding the Working Group, and to the\r\nSecretariat staff for their support.\r\nOur discussions on this issue over the past three years\r\nhave revealed broad agreement on the need to expand the\r\nSecurity Council and to improve its working methods by\r\nmaking it more transparent without eroding its efficiency.\r\nWe have noted with satisfaction the measures adopted so\r\nfar by the Security Council to infuse some transparency\r\ninto its working methods and decision-making processes\r\nsince the Working Group started its work. In particular, we\r\nrecognize, the increase in consultations between the Council\r\nand troop-contributing countries, and the scheduling of\r\nformal meetings which non-members are encouraged to\r\nattend and where they can make presentations if they so\r\ndesire. Equally noteworthy are the periodic consultative\r\nmeetings between the President of the Council and the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. The institutionalization\r\nof these measures has been called for by several\r\ndelegations, including mine, and we hope the Security\r\nCouncil will initiate steps in this direction. It is also\r\nimperative that the opinions and views of non-members of\r\nthe Council, expressed through these consultations, are\r\ntaken into consideration in the Council’s deliberations and\r\ndecision-making. In general, enhanced coordination and\r\nsynergy between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly are absolutely necessary to ensure a proper\r\nbalance between those two bodies, as envisaged under the\r\nCharter.\r\nAs we have stated on previous occasions, any\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council must take into full\r\naccount the current geographical configuration of the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations. This is the\r\nonly way to ensure equity, accountability, representativity\r\nand credibility. And this is especially so when small\r\ncountries are now increasingly called upon to bear a\r\ndisproportionate burden for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, through the provision of\r\ntroops and payment of assessed contributions for various\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nRegarding the issue of expansion, Ghana subscribes\r\nto the position of the African Group, which calls for at\r\nleast two permanent seats and a proportionate number of\r\nnon-permanent seats for our continent. On the question of\r\nthe veto, the delegation of Ghana is of the view that\r\nalthough there might have been good reasons for the veto\r\npower when the Charter was drawn up, it is anachronistic\r\nin its present form and must be modified and limited to\r\nclearly defined situations within the context of Chapter\r\nVII of the United Nations Charter.\r\nOur delegation suggests that consideration should be\r\ngiven to a review of the number of negative votes that\r\ncan constitute a veto in the Council, and that additionally\r\na formula should be worked out under which a Council\r\nveto can be overridden by a certain number of votes in\r\nthe General Assembly. But whatever decision is arrived\r\nat on the scope and parameters of the veto, it must be\r\nextended to any new permanent members of the Council\r\nin order to conform to the principles of equity and\r\nsovereign equality which are the bedrock of the Charter\r\nof the Organization.\r\nThe question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council has\r\nnow been under general discussion for over three years\r\nnow. We feel that the time has come for serious\r\nnegotiations to commence with a view to arriving at a\r\nconsensus within a specified time-frame. Of course, we\r\nrecognize the complex nature of the subject, but we are\r\nready to join in any creative efforts towards working out\r\na meaningful compromise that would respond to our\r\ncommon objectives.\r\nMr. Gorelik (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Today’s discussion confirms, if\r\nconfirmation were needed, that the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council remains the central issue among all the\r\nproblems relating to the reorganization of the United\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nNations. This subject has not only a definite political\r\ndimension but a tangible moral and psychological one as\r\nwell. The membership of the Security Council should\r\nadequately reflect the vast changes in the world as well as\r\nthe impressive increase in the number of United Nations\r\nMember States in recent decades. There is already a\r\nconsensus on this in the Organization.\r\nWe believe that modest but tangible progress resulted\r\nfrom the thorough consideration of the question of an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council that\r\ntook place in the Open-ended Working Group during the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. This is reflected\r\nin the generally high-quality and balanced report of the\r\nGroup, which neither glosses over nor dramatizes the\r\nremaining substantial divergence of views.\r\nSome States are obviously striving to find specific\r\nsolutions in the near future. Existing differences of opinion,\r\nhowever, cannot be overcome by prodding the discussion\r\nor by artificially rushing the inevitably complex search for\r\nconsensus. More time is needed. Not all delegations are\r\nhappy with this, but there is no other solution.\r\nThe Working Group’s report confirms that a number\r\nof States are not prepared to adopt final positions because\r\nof linkages between the size and composition of the\r\nSecurity Council and other matters within the mandate of\r\nthe Working Group. This reminds us once again that any\r\nprogress towards resolving the question of an increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council can be achieved\r\nonly on the basis of realism and a readiness to compromise.\r\nThe present format for considering this issue in the\r\nWorking group is, in our view, the best one. It provides a\r\nflexible framework for reaching consensus and, at the same\r\ntime, maintains the informal nature of the discussion, which\r\nis useful at this stage. We are convinced that attempts to\r\nformalize the discussion or to squeeze it into an arbitrary\r\nnegotiating format, which inevitably distances us from the\r\nconsensual foundation of the Working Group, are counter-\r\nproductive.\r\nProgress towards resolving the question of an increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council depends on the\r\nefforts of all interested States, whatever their size or their\r\nstatus in the United Nations system. There should be no\r\ndivision between those who lead and those who are led.\r\nThe assumption that any party should bear particular\r\nresponsibility for slow progress is, in our view, incorrect.\r\nOur delegation notes with satisfaction that the\r\nWorking Group has increasingly been steering its\r\nactivities towards achievable goals. Extreme and unilinear\r\nscenarios for modifying the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil have been gradually receding in the course of this\r\nprocess. This trend was reflected in the Group’s report,\r\nparticularly with regard to rejecting the so-called quick fix\r\noption, which essentially implies the granting of\r\npermanent residence permits in the Security Council to\r\ntwo developed countries only.\r\nThe other important sign that realism is gaining\r\nground is a clear reference in the report of the Group to\r\nthe fact that efforts relating to increasing the membership\r\nof the Security Council and enhancing its working\r\nmethods are closely linked to preserving and\r\nstrengthening the Council’s efficiency. This approach is\r\nconsistent with the long-standing position of the Russian\r\nFederation.\r\nWith regard to the Council’s decision-making\r\nmechanism, we venture to hope that stereotyped\r\nviewpoints will be toned down in the discussions within\r\nthe Working Group. We believe that critics of Security\r\nCouncil activities are sometimes seeking to provide\r\nanswers to imaginary rather than real questions. We are\r\nstill convinced that there is no reason to modify the\r\ncurrent status of the Security Council’s permanent\r\nmembers, in view of the organic interconnection between\r\ntheir rights and their responsibilities.\r\nWe believe that an improvement in the\r\nrepresentative character of the Security Council should be\r\nbrought about on a balanced basis, taking into account the\r\ninterests of all regional groups and bearing in mind, in\r\nparticular, the need to expand the representation of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe venture to hope that the forthcoming round of\r\nWorking Group activities will be marked by a greater\r\nawareness of the need to retain the compact nature of the\r\nSecurity Council, which is so important for maintaining\r\nits working capacity. This goal would be met, in our\r\nview, by a limited increase in the membership of the\r\nCouncil to the level of some 20 members.\r\nThe Group will have to pay serious attention to\r\nenhancing the methods and procedures of the Security\r\nCouncil, including achieving greater openness. We are\r\nhappy that the concrete steps recently taken by the\r\nCouncil members to this end, including those aimed at\r\nimproving the mechanism of consultations with the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\ncontributors of troops to peacekeeping operations, are now\r\nbetter understood and supported by United Nations\r\nMembers. Not all find them sufficient, however. Still, these\r\nmeasures were dictated by life itself, and should be\r\nconsolidated so as to reveal their full potential. Experience\r\ngained in the course of their implementation would serve as\r\na basis for decisions regarding possible future steps in this\r\narea.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the appreciation\r\nof the Russian delegation to the Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group, the Permanent Representatives of Finland,\r\nMr. Breitenstein, and of Thailand, Mr. Jayanama, for their\r\nvigorous and fruitful contribution to efforts to attain our\r\ncommon goals.\r\nMr. Peleg (Israel): This is the first time that Israel has\r\nspoken here on this most important issue of enlarging the\r\nSecurity Council. We have carefully studied the various\r\nproposals submitted regarding the issue at hand, and we\r\nshare the view that as we approach the twenty-first century,\r\nthe geopolitical situation necessitates making changes in the\r\nCouncil. The issue is complex. It includes the relationship\r\nbetween the permanent and the non-permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council, the size and composition of the\r\nCouncil, the need for geographical representation and\r\nbalance, and the significance of the right of veto.\r\nI must note that when Israel addresses the question of\r\nSecurity Council membership or elections to the Council,\r\nwe do so as the only State Member of this Organization\r\nthat cannot, even theoretically, be elected to serve on the\r\nCouncil. Unlike each and everyone of the 184 other United\r\nNations Member States, Israel is denied membership in a\r\ngeopolitical group.\r\nIsrael, by virtue of our geographic position, is a part\r\nof Asia, and we look forward to the day when we will be\r\naccepted into the Asian group by consensus. Unfortunately,\r\nthis is not the case today, because of some Asian countries\r\nwhich reject our membership in the group.\r\nIn the words of the Charter, the United Nations is:\r\n“based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its\r\nmembers” and on universality of membership.\r\nDistressingly, under the present circumstances, my country\r\ncannot even enjoy the privilege of being disappointed at\r\nfailing to be elected a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIsrael believes that this issue should be of interest to\r\nthe entire international community, for what is at issue here\r\nis not merely Israel’s exclusion from a geopolitical group,\r\nbut the more serious matter of a breach of the Charter,\r\nupon which this entire Organization is based.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAt the outset, I should like to express my sincere thanks\r\nto the President of the General Assembly at its fiftieth\r\nsession, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who last year\r\npresided over the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council, and\r\nwho was particularly dedicated to that work. I should also\r\nlike to thank the two Vice-Chairmen, Ambassadors\r\nBreitenstein and Jayanama, who have presided over the\r\nwork of the Working Group with great competence and\r\na level of perseverance that won our admiration and\r\nsupport.\r\nThe report of the Working Group on the work of its\r\nlast session shows the richness of the ideas put forward\r\nduring deliberations on all the subjects under discussion.\r\nAs a consequence, a consensus emerged on certain non-\r\ncontroversial issues, including the need to expand the\r\nSecurity Council and review its working methods, and to\r\nrespect the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nMembers, and the need for equitable geographical\r\ndistribution when expanding Council membership.\r\nEgypt supports the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Colombia on behalf of the countries of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. Egypt’s position is an\r\nintegral part of that of the Non-Aligned Movement on this\r\nissue, and can be summarized very briefly. First, we need\r\nto correct the current imbalance in the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council and ensure greater representation on it\r\nfor non-aligned States. Secondly, we must reconsider the\r\nSecurity Council’s relationship with the General\r\nAssembly and other bodies of the United Nations system,\r\nincluding the International Court of Justice and regional\r\ngroups, and with countries that contribute troops for\r\npeacekeeping operations. This would ensure greater\r\ntransparency and legitimacy in the Council’s work, and\r\nallow us to find an appropriate formula to involve in the\r\nCouncil’s work States that are not members, so that they\r\ntoo can participate in decision-making, as stipulated in\r\nArticle 44 of the Charter.\r\nThirdly, we must respect the principle of parity and\r\nsymmetry in the treatment of all items on the agenda of\r\nthe Working Group, and accord equal importance to\r\nquestions relating to Security Council enlargement and to\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nreform. Fourthly, the objective of Security Council reform\r\nis to increase the transparency of its work and enhance its\r\neffectiveness and the democratic nature of its decisions.\r\nLast but not least, we must absolutely ensure that a periodic\r\nreview is held of all decisions taken in this respect.\r\nSecurity Council enlargement must not lead to an\r\nincrease in the number of permanent seats granted to\r\ndeveloped States to the detriment of developing countries.\r\nWe must achieve the balance that has not existed in the\r\npast. That must prevail, and that is why we established the\r\nWorking Group some four years ago. The working paper\r\nsubmitted by Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement includes a general framework and expresses the\r\ngeneral position of the States of the Movement with regard\r\nto the enlargement of the Council.\r\nOur paper also makes it clear that we must correct the\r\nimbalance that exists in the Council at present, which is to\r\nthe detriment of the representation of the States of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. At the same time, it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to respect the principle of equitable geographic\r\ndistribution and the sovereign equality of Member States.\r\nThat is why the Non-Aligned Movement has declared that\r\nany predetermined selection of States that is to the\r\ndetriment of the non-aligned countries or the developing\r\ncountries would be unacceptable.\r\nEgypt attaches particular importance to the expansion\r\nof the Security Council. This is an extremely sensitive issue\r\nfor us all, and we must not be too quick to adopt truncated\r\nor partial solutions. That is why negotiations must continue\r\nin good faith and with an open mind so that agreement can\r\nbe reached on an overall solution that the majority can\r\naccept. We do not agree with what have been called quick-\r\nfix solutions. We ask all those who are inclined to such\r\nquick fix solutions to reconsider their positions.\r\nI should like to refer to the statement made by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt during the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, in which he affirmed the\r\nrole played by Egypt in African and Asian bodies, in the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, in the Middle East and elsewhere,\r\nand referred to Egypt’s specific contribution to the United\r\nNations. This role would place Egypt at the forefront of\r\ncountries ready to shoulder increased responsibilities in a\r\nrenewed, more balanced Security Council.\r\nIn this context, we might consider an appropriate\r\nformula that would make it possible to respect equitable\r\ncriteria for an increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. Egypt believes that, above all, it is necessary to\r\ndisplay the utmost realism and to respect contemporary\r\nrealities. Some States play an extremely active role, and\r\nbear the weight of regional responsibility. Such\r\nresponsibility varies from one region to another, but it is\r\nnonetheless important. We must also respect the principle\r\nof sovereign equality so as to give the largest possible\r\nnumber of States an opportunity to be members of the\r\nSecurity Council within a democratic framework. It is\r\nalso necessary to take into consideration the fact that the\r\nnon-aligned countries represent the numerical majority in\r\ncontemporary society. The most basic democratic\r\nprinciples demand that we should respect the numerical\r\nmajority.\r\nFurthermore, we must not neglect another dimension\r\nof our contemporary world fraught with complexities: the\r\ngreat majority of crises and problems currently\r\nthreatening international peace and security are taking\r\nplace in the territories of non-aligned countries, and most\r\noften involve countries of the third world. It is imperative\r\nto increase the number of non-aligned members of the\r\nCouncil in order that it may benefit from their vitality and\r\nfrom the contribution they can make towards resolving\r\nthese disputes and crises. This is a factor that will\r\nassuredly enhance the effectiveness and credibility of the\r\nSecurity Council and strengthen its decisions.\r\nIn the light of all I have said, Egypt believes that, if\r\nwe are to implement all of these criteria realistically, we\r\nmust consider creating new seats for a restricted number\r\nof States from each region. Such an arrangement could\r\nallow the largest possible number of States to play a role\r\nwithin the Security Council. Egypt has also raised the\r\nidea of rotation within each region and, in this context,\r\nwould like to address the question of the consensus that\r\nprevails in the Organization of African Unity on Africa’s\r\nright to hold two permanent seats on the renewed Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIt should be recognized that there are two major\r\nobstacles in the way of expansion. First, there are bound\r\nto be negative repercussions on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil because of the increased number of States that\r\nmight exercise the right of veto. Secondly, it has been\r\ndifficult to reach agreement on the right of the third world\r\nto permanent seats on the Security Council because of the\r\ndiverse circumstances and situations of individual\r\ncountries and because of the differences between Asia,\r\nAfrica and Latin America. That is why I believe that it\r\nwould be better at the next stage of negotiations for us to\r\nreflect on the idea put forward by some States, including\r\nItaly, to identify a new method for choosing certain States\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nthat have particular importance in their region and could\r\nassume special responsibilities for the maintenance of\r\npeace, strictly within a democratic framework. Their\r\nincreased responsibilities would also reflect the realities of\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nAs regards the review of the Council’s working\r\nmethods, Egypt would like to refer to the voting system in\r\nthat organ, which remains temporary because we have not\r\nbeen able to reach agreement on clear criteria for\r\ndistinguishing between procedural and substantive issues.\r\nFifty years after the creation of the United Nations, the\r\nrules of procedure of the Council are still provisional. In\r\nthis respect, as coordinator of the non-aligned countries and\r\non their behalf, Egypt submitted a document on the\r\nquestion of the increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, elucidating the Movement’s position on the right\r\nof veto. This paper affirmed that it is high time for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to study the scope of application of the\r\nright of veto in a coherent and comprehensive way in order\r\nto standardize the procedures and restrict the scope.\r\nNonetheless, day after day, we see new abuses of the right\r\nof veto. Suffice it to mention the great media uproar\r\nprompted by one permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil recently in connection with the re-election of the\r\nSecretary-General, as though this question involved a threat\r\nto international peace and security and the choice of a\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations had suddenly\r\nbecome the cornerstone of international relations and the\r\nkey to the door to international peace and security.\r\nThe Charter contains no provision giving a blank\r\ncheque to members of the Council in its recommendation\r\nto the General Assembly regarding the re-election of a\r\nSecretary-General. Nonetheless, we have seen this\r\nphenomenon in the Security Council. In the final analysis,\r\nthe appointment of a Secretary-General is a prerogative of\r\nthe General Assembly. It is certainly a curious paradox —\r\none that will go down in the annals of history — that the\r\nState now threatening to exercise its right of veto against\r\nthe re-election of the Secretary-General is the same State\r\nthat, in 1950, presented a constitutional and legal advisory\r\nopinion aimed at strengthening the authority of the General\r\nAssembly and asking that the role of the Security Council\r\nbe disregarded in this respect. How things have changed.\r\nEgypt wishes to stress that it is also absolutely\r\nessential to take another look at the way in which decisions\r\nare adopted in the Security Council and to broaden the\r\nprocess of consultation with States that are at the centre of\r\ncertain events under discussion in the Council. I have\r\nreferred to Article 44 of the Charter, which advocates\r\nconsultations with Member States, and to Article 50,\r\nwhich says that if a State finds itself confronted with\r\nspecial economic problems arising from the carrying out\r\nof measures adopted by the Council under Chapter VII,\r\nthat State shall be consulted. Such consultation has yet to\r\ntake place, either under Article 44 or Article 50.\r\nEgypt advocates the broadening of consultations with\r\nStates that are not members of the Council. Regional\r\norganizations should also be involved, especially those\r\nfrom regions at the heart of problems under discussion in\r\nthe Council, and particularly when questions are involved\r\nthat could lead to the deployment of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping forces.\r\nIn conclusion, there can be no doubt that the\r\nWorking Group has discussed a number of essential ideas\r\nwithout which it would be impossible to continue\r\nnegotiations in that forum in a positive way. This in itself\r\nis promising. I cannot conclude my statement without\r\ncommending once again the efforts made by the two\r\nVice-Chairmen, the Ambassadors of Finland and\r\nThailand. My delegation pledges to cooperate with them\r\nin order to make further progress on these vital issues at\r\nthe current session.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): The question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council is of\r\nan importance commensurate with the role and vital\r\nresponsibilities of the Council in maintaining international\r\npeace and security. My delegation has followed with great\r\ninterest the discussions of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup at the past three sessions. As is well known, it has\r\nnot been possible to reach a consensus on the enlargement\r\nof the membership of the Security Council or on other\r\nmatters related to improved working methods, despite the\r\nnumerous meetings held by the Working Group over the\r\npast three years.\r\nKuwait’s interest in the current discussions on\r\nincreasing the membership of the Security Council arises\r\nfrom its desire to preserve the effectiveness and capacity\r\nof that important organ in maintaining international peace\r\nand security. That was very apparent in the Security\r\nCouncil’s efforts in confronting and dealing with the Iraqi\r\ninvasion of Kuwait. The effectiveness and speed\r\ndemonstrated by the Security Council in reaction to the\r\nIraqi aggression and occupation in 1990 through to the\r\nliberation of Kuwait in 1991, and its determination to\r\nensure the implementation of all its relevant resolutions,\r\nshould be preserved and enhanced to serve as a deterrent\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nto the aggressive violation by States of the principles of\r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter and to\r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nKuwait shares the interests, concerns and ambitions of\r\nother small countries regarding the current discussion on\r\nthe enlargement of the membership of the Security Council.\r\nSmall countries should not be the victims of any\r\nagreements reached in the Working Group. Any failure to\r\nconsider the aspirations, ambitions and objectives of small\r\ncountries could lead to a Security Council lacking balance,\r\ndemocracy and full legitimacy. We therefore hope that the\r\nbasic principles proposed and confirmed by the Non-\r\nAligned Movement — sovereign equality among all\r\nMember States and equitable geographical distribution —\r\nwill be adhered to.\r\nKuwait supports an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council for many reasons. The enormous increase\r\nin the membership of the United Nations, international\r\ndevelopments and a new world reality that has generated\r\nmany challenges require United Nations organs, particularly\r\nthe Security Council, to adapt to those challenges. My\r\ndelegation believes that any increase in Security Council\r\nmembership should aim at the following goals and\r\nobjectives: first, to strengthen and enhance the Security\r\nCouncil, enabling it to assume its enormous responsibilities\r\nfor maintaining international peace and security; secondly,\r\nto reflect in its new composition the current reality of the\r\ninternational community and the General Assembly, which\r\nnow has a membership of 185 Member States; thirdly, to\r\ngive added weight to the Security Council’s decisions and\r\nto strengthen its authority and credibility; fourthly, to\r\nimplement the principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and to enhance the Council’s democratic and\r\nrepresentative aspect; and fifthly, to maintain the Council’s\r\neffectiveness and efficiency and to ensure that an increase\r\nin membership does not weaken its actions.\r\nKuwait believes that there are several countries that\r\nhave proven, through their relations with the United\r\nNations, that they are capable of assuming the main\r\nresponsibilities of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and of assisting in achieving the United Nations\r\nobjectives in the political, economic, social and\r\ncultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping\r\noperations and their considerable financial contributions to\r\nthe various budgets of these operations and to the regular\r\nUnited Nations budget.\r\nWe therefore believe that it is only fair that these\r\ncountries be given special consideration, since they meet\r\nthe criteria necessary to fulfil the role expected of them.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation believes that the Italian\r\nproposal on an increase in non-permanent seats merits\r\nfurther consideration, interest and study. At the same\r\ntime, we draw attention to Tunisia’s valuable proposal\r\nand believe that it, too, merits serious consideration.\r\nAs for the reform and improvement of the Security\r\nCouncil’s working methods and its relations with other\r\nUnited Nations organs, in particular the General\r\nAssembly, Kuwait supports all proposals aimed at\r\nproviding increased transparency and clarity in the work\r\nof the Security Council and an increased flow of\r\ninformation to and from the Member States. We also\r\naffirm the need for the Security Council continuously and\r\nsystematically to consult with States directly or indirectly\r\ninterested in and concerned with the issues and conflicts\r\nunder discussion, as this practice would enhance the\r\nlegitimacy and the credibility of Security Council\r\ndecisions on such issues.\r\nWe also call on the Security Council to develop and\r\nimplement consultation procedures with the States\r\ncontributing to peacekeeping operations and urge that\r\nsuch cooperation, coordination and consultation be\r\nmaintained through all stages of peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe Security Council should regularly inform the troop-\r\ncontributing countries on the political and security\r\ndevelopments that may be of interest to them.\r\nAs for the question of the veto, my delegation\r\nconsiders that there have been several constructive and\r\nobjective proposals that merit serious consideration,\r\nwithin the framework of the Working Group, in the\r\nsearch for a consensus formula that satisfies all parties\r\nand will ensure the Security Council’s ability to carry out\r\nits tasks without hindrance.\r\nFinally, we hope that the efforts and discussions of\r\nthe Working Group will be crowned with the success of\r\na consensus that ensures and enhances the role of the\r\nSecurity Council in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity and allows the Council to benefit from past\r\nexperience in dealing with current events and facing\r\nfuture challenges.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I have an announcement to make in\r\nconnection with the election of the five members of the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 45th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 30 October 1996\r\nInternational Court of Justice, which is scheduled to take\r\nplace on Wednesday, 6 November. I should like to draw\r\nthe Assembly’s attention to the relevant documents.\r\nFirst, document A/51/333-S/1996/722 sets out the\r\ncomposition of the Court and the procedure for the election\r\nin the General Assembly and in the Security Council.\r\nSecondly, document A/51/335-S/1996/724 contains the\r\ncurricula vitae of the candidates. Thirdly, document\r\nA/51/334-S/1996/723 contains the list of candidates\r\nsubmitted within the required time for submission; and,\r\nfinally, document A/51/417-S/1996/794 and Add.1\r\ncontains additional nominations received after 31 August\r\n1996.\r\nIn this regard, an additional nomination has been\r\nreceived since the issuance of the documents I have just\r\nmentioned. As members are aware, additional nominations\r\nare submitted in support of candidatures presented within\r\nthe established deadline.\r\nIn order to facilitate the preparation and conduct of\r\nthe election procedure, it would seem desirable that the\r\nAssembly have before it, as it has in the past, a\r\nconsolidated and updated list of candidates. Accordingly,\r\nif there is no objection, I shall request the Secretariat to\r\nissue a consolidated and updated list of candidates under\r\nthe symbol A/51/334/Rev.1-S/1996/723/Rev.1, so as to\r\nreflect all the information received since the issuance of\r\nthe original list and thus facilitate the election for all\r\nrepresentatives.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly so decides.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
