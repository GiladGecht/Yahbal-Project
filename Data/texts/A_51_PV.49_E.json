(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 47 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): Much attention was devoted,\r\nthroughout the fiftieth session of the General Assembly, to\r\nthe question of the restructuring and reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Much of that exercise was initiated and conducted\r\npartly because it was the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, and many thought that something needed to be\r\ndone as it turned 50, and partly because of the serious\r\nfinancial situation in which the Organization found itself,\r\nleading to the search for some sort of a package deal that\r\nwould quickly fix these financial problems and make them\r\ndisappear at the snap of a finger.\r\nLittle thought was given, however, to the far deeper\r\nneed to re-examine the very fundamentals on which our\r\nassumptions of 1945 were built and to attempt to identify\r\na fresh set of objectives that could lead our Organization\r\ninto its next half century. It is this inability to come to\r\nterms with the new realities of a world 50 years down the\r\nline that has led to the impasse we are at today.\r\nThroughout the fiftieth anniversary year, the\r\nnegotiations in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council remained largely\r\ndeadlocked. The report of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup, contained in document A/50/47 of 13 September\r\n1996, confirms this, as it shows that no headway was\r\nmade on any of the core issues during 1996. It is\r\nunfortunate that despite three years of negotiations we are\r\nnot even close to reaching agreement on the fundamental\r\nissues of the expansion and reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. The fact is that this is due to the very wide\r\ndivergence of views on the fundamental principles on the\r\nbasis of which the Council should be expanded.\r\nThere are those who want the reform of the Council\r\nto merely take into account the appearance of some new\r\npolitical and economic actors on the global scene. The\r\nvast majority, however, argues that the reform should take\r\ninto account the emergence of a large number of countries\r\nas a result of the decolonization process that took place\r\nafter the Second World War. There are also those who\r\nrightly argue that if we really want to reform the Security\r\nCouncil, then we should re-examine the fundamental\r\nassumptions on which this institution was established in\r\n1945 and see if these are still valid after 50 years, and\r\nwhether they will continue to be valid for the next 50\r\nyears. The situation in 1945 was after all a totally\r\nextraordinary but static one. The victors of the Second\r\nWorld War simply allocated to themselves permanent\r\nseats on the Security Council. In the process, they created\r\na non-democratic centre of privilege and invented the\r\nanachronistic veto. We should not, therefore, repeat the\r\nmistake of 1945.\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nOver the past three years, our debate in the Working\r\nGroup has been mostly repetitive. We have moved from an\r\nissue approach to a cluster approach, and back to an issue\r\napproach again in an effort to make forward movement. If\r\nwe have not been able to succeed, it is because the problem\r\nbefore us is essentially political and not procedural in\r\nnature, with vast differences in opinions.\r\nThe fact is that there is no consensus today, nor is one\r\nlikely in the foreseeable future, on a quick expansion in the\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council. The reality\r\nis that the existing permanent members are not willing to\r\naccept restrictions on their power of the veto, let alone to\r\nrenounce it. The fact is that many important members of\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly are not\r\neven willing to allow forward movement on the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council, as they want to hold any\r\nreform of the working methods hostage to a quick decision\r\non expansion. The reality is that, but for a few countries,\r\nmost of the members of the General Assembly would be\r\nquite happy to see an expansion of the non-permanent\r\ncategory alone in the Security Council.\r\nOver a dozen proposals have so far been formally\r\nsubmitted on the question of an increase in the membership\r\nof the Council. However, none of these proposals appears\r\nto have been able to attract the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority in support. We know that six countries have\r\nannounced their candidatures for the permanent membership\r\nof the Council. Two of them are economic Powers today.\r\nOthers are being perceived as no more than floor-crossers\r\nfrom the original Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) position\r\non centres of privilege that they themselves had\r\ntraditionally espoused.\r\nPakistan continues to be strongly opposed to any\r\nincrease in the permanent membership of the Council. The\r\nPrime Minister of Pakistan at the fiftieth anniversary\r\nsession of the General Assembly said that:\r\n“The Security Council needs enlargement, but not in\r\nits permanent membership.” (Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, 39th meeting,\r\np. 24)\r\nThat statement echoes the opinion of the vast majority of\r\nthe Members of the United Nations.\r\nWe believe that any increase in the permanent\r\nmembership would serve the interests of only a few\r\ncountries and would be to the detriment of small and\r\nmedium-sized countries, which constitute the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the membership of the United Nations.\r\nPakistan, like most of the others, remains strongly\r\nopposed to centres of privilege within the United Nations\r\nsystem. These are anachronistic, anti-democratic, and\r\ncontrary to the spirit of sovereign equality as enshrined in\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nAn important fallout of permanent membership is the\r\n“cascade effect”, which has been described in document\r\nA/AC.247/5 of 14 September 1995. It would be fair to\r\nsay that by increasing permanent membership, we would\r\nnot only strengthen the club of the aristocratic elite, but\r\nwould also proportionately reduce the chances of election\r\nof non-members to United Nations organs.\r\nPakistan and many other countries advocate an\r\nincrease in the category of non-permanent membership in\r\norder to proportionately reflect the increase that has taken\r\nplace in the general membership of the United Nations. In\r\nthis regard, the non-aligned position is that if there is no\r\nconsensus on an increase in other categories of\r\nmembership — and as we know there is none — then\r\nexpansion should take place only in the non-permanent\r\ncategory for the time being. Only a very few delegations\r\nhave categorically stated that if there was no increase in\r\nthe permanent membership, there would be no expansion\r\nof the Security Council at all.\r\nIt is high time, then, for us to try as quickly as we\r\ncan, to establish that which is achievable, and that which\r\nis not. To do so, we need to determine first of all, once\r\nand for all, whether there is or is not any chance of a\r\nconsensus emerging on the issue of the expansion of\r\npermanent membership. If there is not, which clearly\r\nappears to be the case, then let us identify, without\r\nwasting any more time, what really is doable in the way\r\nof Security Council restructuring and reform.\r\nSince major divergences exist, could we not as a\r\nfirst step consider the expansion of non-permanent\r\nmembership alone, and some reform of the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council? This would respond to\r\nthe wishes of the vast majority of Member States. In this\r\ncontext, I would again recall the non-aligned position,\r\nnamely that if there is no agreement on other categories\r\nof membership, then expansion should take place in the\r\nnon-permanent category for the time being.\r\nAt least two papers presented in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group already have the support of nearly two\r\nthirds of the membership of the United Nations, namely\r\nthe non-aligned position paper of February 1995, and the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nnon-aligned veto paper of March this year. In addition, the\r\nMexican proposal on the veto, and the Czech proposal on\r\nArticle 31 appear to enjoy very wide support. There is also\r\nthe interesting Italian proposal, which has received very\r\nwide support, and which in essence refers to an increase in\r\nthe non-permanent membership. These papers could form\r\nthe basis of our future discussions in the Working Group.\r\nThe Czech proposal that non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil should be allowed to participate in informal\r\nconsultations of the Council under Article 31 of the\r\nCharter, hits the nail on the head on the question of the\r\nabsence of transparency in the so-called informal working\r\nprocesses of the Security Council. This absence of\r\ntransparency was less important some years ago, when the\r\nSecurity Council met infrequently and adopted only the\r\nvery few resolutions that it did. Now that it meets every\r\nday, mostly in informals, and is taking daily decisions,\r\nsurely some method can be found to enable those who are\r\ninterested to observe and follow its work and deliberations\r\nin a more elegant manner than through corridor gossip and\r\nhearsay.\r\nOther issues that merit consideration include enhanced\r\ncooperation between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly; consultation between the Security Council\r\nmembers and a country which may be affected by a\r\ndecision of the Council; the institutionalization of\r\nconsultations between the President of the Security Council\r\nwith the respective Chairmen of regional groups on\r\nimportant issues, regular and transparent briefings on\r\ninformal consultations; the institutionalization of a system\r\nof consultations during the decision-making process on the\r\nestablishment, the conduct and the termination of\r\npeacekeeping operations; the availability to all Members of\r\nthe records of the sanctions committees; the greater use of\r\npolitical mediation arrangements by the Security Council\r\nfor the settlement of disputes; the use by the Council of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice; a greater involvement of the\r\ngeneral membership in the decision-making process of the\r\nCouncil; the institutionalization of the briefings of the\r\nPresident of the Council to the general membership;\r\nprovisions for the prompt convening of formal meetings of\r\nthe Security Council at the request of a State Member of\r\nthe United Nations; and a review of the veto power of the\r\npermanent members.\r\nIn conclusion, we are not here to repeat or compound\r\nthe errors of 1945, but to reverse them. Our objective\r\nshould be to expand the Security Council and to review its\r\nworking methods, and other matters related to its\r\nfunctioning, in a way that further strengthens its capacity\r\nand effectiveness, enhances its representative character,\r\nand improves its working efficiency. It is not an easy\r\nobjective, but let us make an honest attempt to achieve it.\r\nMr. Butler (Australia): Mr. President, as this is the\r\nfirst occasion on which I am addressing the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly, may I begin by\r\nrepeating the remarks made to you on 30 September by\r\nmy Foreign Minister, Mr. Alexander Downer, when he\r\nexpressed to you the immense pleasure Australia feels at\r\nseeing you, the representative of a close, neighbouring\r\ncountry, presiding over this Assembly. I know personally\r\nthat your skill and determination will guide us well in the\r\nyear ahead.\r\nIt is impressive that so many Member States have\r\nchosen to take part in this plenary debate on the question\r\nof the Security Council of the future. As it has been a\r\nlong debate, I will come fairly directly to the point.\r\nNo one should doubt the deep importance of this\r\nsubject. Of all the things known about the United Nations\r\namongst interested groups of people around the world, the\r\nfirst is that the current configuration of the Security\r\nCouncil is no longer right. The same is true of the\r\nworld’s media. Sadly, the media all too often fail to\r\nreport other aspects of the work of the United Nations,\r\nbut unfailingly report the work of the Security Council;\r\nand the media, like ordinary citizens, know that the\r\nSecurity Council needs to be modernized.\r\nThese facts have a clear meaning. If we delay any\r\nfurther in coming towards closure of our work on the\r\nmodernization of the Security Council, we will risk\r\nserious criticism and ultimately great harm to the United\r\nNations in ways that go beyond the work of the Council\r\nitself. It is with this conviction that Australia offers the\r\nfollowing remarks.\r\nThe debate of the past few days has shown, once\r\nagain, that there is general acceptance that the Security\r\nCouncil must be expanded and modernized. The question\r\nof how expansion and modernization should be achieved\r\nhas been the subject of intense, often difficult but,\r\nultimately, very valuable discussion in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council. Australia is deeply grateful to the co-\r\nVice-Chairmen for their work and, perhaps especially, for\r\ntheir patience.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nWhat can be said of last year’s work? First, the Open-\r\nended Working Group made substantive progress during the\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly in laying the\r\ngroundwork for a solution with respect to the size and\r\ncomposition of an expanded and modernized Council; the\r\ndecision-making processes of such a Council, including the\r\nveto; and improvements in its working methods. Secondly,\r\nbut paradoxically, despite the richness of the debate and our\r\nexhaustive discussion of proposals and approaches, the\r\nWorking Group was obliged to conclude its deliberations of\r\nthe fiftieth session no closer to an agreed solution than\r\nwhen it began, three years ago.\r\nThe meaning of these two equal but apparently\r\ncontradictory facts is that we must find a way to move\r\nforward during the fifty-first session of the Assembly. Put\r\nsimply, the kind of shadow-play we have been witnessing\r\nshould come to an end.\r\nThe Working Group must not continue simply to\r\ndebate the issues for a further year. The issues have been\r\nthoroughly discussed. We are all familiar with them. To\r\nrepeat the debates yet again would lead nowhere, other than\r\npossibly to public disappointment.\r\nWhat we must do now is begin serious negotiations on\r\na whole package of amendments to the Charter, because, let\r\nno one forget, in the end that is what is at issue here —\r\namendments to the Charter.\r\nAustralia will work actively for a consensus outcome.\r\nNegotiations to that end should be concluded within a\r\nreasonable time-frame and presented to the General\r\nAssembly for consideration, in accordance with Article 108\r\nof the Charter. If consensus does not prove possible, then\r\na package that appeared to command the support of a very\r\nsubstantial majority of Member States might have to be\r\nacted upon by the Assembly.\r\nAustralia shares the widely accepted view that the\r\nmembership of the Security Council needs to better reflect\r\ncurrent political and economic circumstances. We think that\r\nthe following elements would be essential parts of any such\r\nwhole reform package.\r\nFirst, Japan and Germany must become permanent\r\nmembers. This is the very least the United Nations can do\r\nto acknowledge their status and the financial contribution\r\nthey are making to the Organization.\r\nThere must also be permanent seats for under-\r\nrepresented regions. How this should be achieved needs\r\nfurther discussion. Not what but how this should be\r\nachieved needs further discussion, primarily by the\r\nregions concerned. For Australia’s part, we are flexible.\r\nSuch seats could conceivably be filled by a single\r\nMember State or by rotating membership amongst leading\r\nMember States, but agreed to by the regional groupings.\r\nNext, the number of non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil should be increased in such a way as to ensure\r\nmore balanced and equitable representation. In this\r\ncontext, a number of interesting proposals have been put\r\nforward in the Working Group, and again Australia\r\nremains willing to discuss these flexibly.\r\nSo what would this mean for the total? The total\r\nnumber for an expanded Council should be about 25.\r\nSuch a number would allow for the kinds of increases I\r\nhave just mentioned without causing a reduction in the\r\nefficiency of the work of the Council.\r\nIn addition, it is essential that the terms of Article 23\r\nof the Charter, with respect to the characteristics of States\r\nseeking election to the Council, be followed faithfully.\r\nThe Council is not a universal body but a representative\r\none. It must be made up of States that meet the primary\r\ncriteria outlined in Article 23. The democracy of the\r\nUnited Nations is deeply rooted in the General Assembly,\r\nbut the Council reports to the Assembly.\r\nWe must insist, then, that its report be material, not\r\nmerely procedural, and that consideration of it by the\r\nAssembly is a significant political event and be\r\nrecognized as such. It is in this context — the context of\r\nthe democracy of the General Assembly — that every\r\nMember State has and must retain its equal voice with all\r\nothers. But those who preach a notion of rotation as a\r\nfirst principle in the context of elections to the Security\r\nCouncil are in fact seeking to revise the important terms\r\nof Article 23 of the Charter.\r\nIt is beyond doubt that there is deep concern to\r\narrive at a new understanding and clarification of the veto\r\npower, its inner nature and the legitimate conditions under\r\nwhich it can and should be used. Unwelcome though this\r\nissue may be for some, it must be pursued.\r\nAs a final point, I would emphasize that without\r\nagreement on the size and composition of the Security\r\nCouncil, other pressing aspects of both Security Council\r\nand wider United Nations reform are very unlikely to be\r\nrealized. The most pressing example of this is provided\r\nby the current debates on contributions to be paid by\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nMember States. These issues are not likely to be resolved\r\nuntil Member States have decided on an increase in the\r\npermanent membership of the Council, given the\r\nimplications that such an expansion would have for the\r\nscale of assessments and the payment of contributions.\r\nI hope that, during your term as President and under\r\nyour guidance, this Assembly will see substantial progress\r\ntowards solutions to the reform of both the Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations more widely, in keeping\r\nwith the agreement reached in the fiftieth anniversary\r\nDeclaration that we\r\n“will give to the twenty-first century a United\r\nNations equipped, financed and structured to\r\nserve effectively the peoples in whose name it\r\nwas established”. (Resolution 50/6, fifth\r\npreambular paragraph)\r\nMy delegation will support you in whatever steps you\r\ntake towards ensuring the beginning of substantive\r\nnegotiations on a package of amendments to the Charter\r\nthrough which the Security Council can be modernized.\r\nMr. Van-Dunem “Mbinda” (Angola): I would like\r\nto thank you, Sir, for calling on me to express, in the name\r\nof my Government, our point of view on the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council and related matters.\r\nAt a time when profound changes are taking place in\r\nthe international arena and the United Nations is being\r\nincreasingly called upon to face new challenges that are not\r\nalways conciliatory and require the concerted efforts of all\r\nMember States, regardless of size, geographical situation or\r\neconomic and military might, it is vital that a broad\r\nprogramme of comprehensive reform of the multilateral\r\ninstitutions be adopted to further measures, in a decisive\r\nmanner, for the democratization of international relations\r\nbased on the rule of law and the mutual benefit of States.\r\nMy delegation took note of the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil, which reflects the agreement reached on the need\r\nto expand the Security Council, review its working methods\r\nand other questions related to its operation, in such a way\r\nas to reinforce its capacity and effectiveness.\r\nAllow me to express our support for you, Sir, in your\r\nassignment of steering these proceedings and, at the same\r\ntime, to acknowledge all those who have made a\r\ndedicated effort to accomplish this work, in particular the\r\noutgoing President and the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group. We hope the outcome of those efforts\r\nwill help improve international relations in the days\r\nahead.\r\nWe would like also to support the statement made\r\nby the Ambassador of Colombia on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\nAs an important component of United Nations\r\nreform, the reform of the Security Council presents itself\r\ntoday, as we approach a new century, more than ever\r\nbefore as a crucial need to which no one can remain\r\nindifferent.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must focus on\r\nredressing the imbalance in regional representation, a\r\nparticularly serious inadequacy in the representation of\r\ndeveloping countries. A more democratic and transparent\r\nSecurity Council, as far as decision-making and\r\nimplementation are concerned, can only become a reality\r\nwhen it has equitable, and hence non-discriminatory,\r\nrepresentation and when the number of its permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members is addressed in the light of the\r\nnew realities arising from 50 years of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe believe that such an important body of the\r\nUnited Nations should have the necessary prerogatives to\r\nrespond to the challenges of today’s changing world. An\r\norgan such as the Security Council has to be strong and\r\nresponsible enough to tackle international matters\r\nwhenever and wherever it is required to do so. It is\r\nnevertheless important to state that efforts to ensure the\r\ntransparent character of this body must continue.\r\nFor the Republic of Angola, whose position of\r\nprinciple on this matter is the same as that stated by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the claim to a minimum\r\nof two permanent seats in the Security Council is the\r\nclaim to a right to which the African continent is entitled\r\nand one that we will not abdicate.\r\nWe also support the right of other world regions to\r\nbe equitably represented in the Security Council through\r\npermanent member status. In our opinion, it is not\r\nenough, however, to increase the number of permanent\r\nand non-permanent members in the Council; it is also\r\ncrucial that the new members elected to this relevant\r\nUnited Nations organ be recognized as having all the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nappropriate rights and responsibilities, in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of the Charter, including the veto right, on an\r\nequal footing. We have noticed with great apprehension\r\nthat, in some circles, a new category of permanent member\r\nis being discussed that would deprive the respective\r\ncountries of some of the prerogatives that the current five\r\npermanent members have today. My country vigorously\r\nopposes that solution and appeals to its sponsors to give up\r\nthis idea.\r\nThe use of the veto by the current permanent members\r\nof the Security Council is a question that concerns us all\r\nand that, in our opinion, warrants the careful attention of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group in charge of the reform of\r\nthe Security Council, although we believe that the\r\ndiscussion of such a matter should not be linked to the\r\ndecision that will be made on the expansion of the Council.\r\nIn the opinion of my country, Angola, the use of the\r\nveto is inconsistent with present-day realities, and therefore\r\nwe are in favour of its abolition or, if that is not possible,\r\nof its amendment and the consequent granting of that\r\nprerogative to new members that are elected. My delegation\r\nconsiders that major elements for comprehensive reform are\r\nnow on the table and that at its next round of substantive\r\ndiscussions the Working Group should move to a more\r\nconcrete phase.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our willingness\r\nto continue to work within the Open-ended Working Group,\r\nbecause we believe that, with the concurrence of all\r\nMembers of the United Nations, it will be possible to\r\ntransform the Security Council into a more democratic\r\nUnited Nations body, with operating methods that do not\r\ndiscriminate against any country or region in the world and\r\nthat will help to make our planet a world of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): I welcome once again the\r\nopportunity to participate, on behalf of the delegation of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, in deliberations on this very\r\nimportant core issue of United Nations reform: the question\r\nof equitable representation on and expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Security Council is the only organ of the United\r\nNations charged with the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Its successes or failures, weaknesses or\r\nstrengths affect all Member States as well as the other\r\norgans of the United Nations. It is therefore important for\r\nthe Council to underscore its legitimacy through equitable\r\nrepresentation that is proportional to the increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Without such\r\nexpanded representation, the legitimacy of its authority\r\nremains questionable.\r\nWhen the Organization was formed 50 years ago,\r\nmany countries in existence today, especially in the\r\nregions of Africa and Asia, were still fighting for their\r\nindependence from colonial occupation and domination.\r\nThe world had just experienced the gigantic scourge of\r\nthe Second World War. The painful lesson of the war\r\nprompted the victors, meeting in San Francisco, to\r\narrogate to themselves enormous powers and privileges in\r\nan effort to ensure that the mistakes that had led to the\r\nwar would not recur.\r\nEnormous changes have taken place since the\r\nformation of the Security Council, and since the end of\r\nthe cold war — most notably, the increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Obviously, the status\r\nquo in the Security Council does not reflect all\r\ncontemporary realities. This legacy should not continue in\r\nperpetuity. The fact that circumstances in the international\r\nsystem have changed so fundamentally is a compelling\r\nreason for change in the composition of the Council. The\r\npresent composition of the Security Council is generally\r\nunrepresentative, iniquitous and anachronistic. Such a\r\nsituation is inconsistent with the universal principles of\r\ndemocracy and the equality of States. These principles not\r\nonly hold sway, but also form the cornerstone of\r\ninternational discourse among nations.\r\nThe issue of the size and composition of the Security\r\nCouncil, particularly with regard to the permanent\r\nmembership, which is the bone of contention, is also of\r\nmajor concern to my delegation. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland is convinced that the position of Africa in its\r\nquest for a minimum of two permanent seats is necessary\r\nand justifiable. We therefore stand by this view, and we\r\nare ready to engage in further discussion with Member\r\nStates to find a lasting solution to this matter. However,\r\na fruitful debate can be carried out only if the permanent\r\nmembers exercise flexibility to accommodate change.\r\nSeveral proposals have been advanced for an\r\nincrease in the non-permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. We believe that 25 should be a minimum figure\r\nand that the principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation must be strictly observed in both categories\r\nof Security Council membership. In our view this would\r\nenhance the legitimacy of the Council’s authority; it is the\r\nonly way to address the imbalance that afflicts the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nCouncil, in which four out of five permanent members\r\nrepresent the same civilization.\r\nTurning to the process of decision-making in the\r\nSecurity Council, including the issue of the veto, my\r\ndelegation fully associates itself with the declaration of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement that was adopted at the Eleventh\r\nConference of Heads of State or Government of Non-\r\nAligned Countries in Cartagena, Colombia, in October\r\n1995, in which they reaffirmed their commitment to\r\npromote a better relationship between the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly and also to encourage the curtailment of\r\nthe use of the veto.\r\nFinally, measures should be taken by the Council to\r\nenhance its working methods and procedures and to\r\nimprove its working relationship with the other United\r\nNations organs and the general membership. Such measures\r\nshould also be formalized and institutionalized so as to\r\nensure their effective systematic implementation. While we\r\nrecognize the fact that measures have been taken by the\r\nCouncil to improve its working methods, these measures\r\nremain partial and unpredictable, and are implemented only\r\nat the whim and will of the Council.\r\nI should like to make some remarks addressed directly\r\nto you, Mr. President, in your capacity as my colleague and\r\nfriend. Your country has assumed the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and it is faced with a number of crucial\r\nissues that beset the global world today. I have this\r\nquestion to ask you, Mr. President: Have you ever\r\nconsidered the possibility of holding a session in which\r\nMember States could devote time to invite God to\r\nparticipate with us? In such a session we could pray, in all\r\nthe languages that we speak here, asking God to intervene\r\nto guide the United Nations, especially the Security\r\nCouncil, as it faces and disentangles the issues that are a\r\nbone of contention, and deals with the pain that affects us\r\nfrom head to toe and to our deepest marrow.\r\nAny success that we can achieve can be possible only\r\nif God the Almighty can be invited persistently and be\r\ngiven a chance. I know very well, Mr. President, that you\r\nsay you pray in your own household. I wish to reaffirm the\r\nbelief of the Kingdom of Swaziland, which believes in God,\r\nthat, where there is a problem, God is ready to intervene.\r\nThere is a problem in the Security Council, but how often\r\nhave we invited God to soften the hearts of those countries\r\nthat are misusing the power of veto to the great detriment\r\nof the small nations? You will pardon me, Mr. President;\r\nthe spirit of God has inspired me. But I would conclude by\r\ninviting you to consider this seriously. Through God, we\r\nshall be successful. Through God, the United Nations can\r\nchange.\r\nMr. Ayewah (Nigeria): In contributing to the debate\r\non the question of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters, my delegation would like to express its\r\nappreciation to the co-Vice-Chairmen of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group who, during the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, worked tirelessly and with a great deal\r\nof purpose and patience in an effort to reach meaningful\r\nconclusions. The deliberations thus far have revealed the\r\ncomplexity of the subject matter and the challenges facing\r\nthe Working Group. It has certainly not been an easy\r\ntask, and the position of the co-Vice-Chairmen has not\r\nbeen a particularly enviable one. We thank them for the\r\nefforts they have made in producing the report of the\r\nWorking Group, which is now before us as document\r\nA/50/47 of 13 September 1996.\r\nAs one of the sponsors of the initial resolution that\r\nled to the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the\r\nthirty-fourth session of the General Assembly, the\r\nNigerian delegation is disappointed that after such a long\r\nperiod of time we are no nearer to an agreement on the\r\nmost appropriate composition of the Council, nor are we\r\ncloser to a solution of the key questions of the expansion\r\nand size of the Council in both categories of membership.\r\nIn fact, we seem to be going around in circles. Year in\r\nand year out, the Working Group starts out with a lot of\r\nideas and hopeful proposals, but it seems to end up at a\r\ndead end. Against the background of the wide-ranging\r\nideas that have been expressed and the rich discussions\r\nwe have had, the paucity of this year’s report attests to\r\nthis unsatisfactory state of affairs.\r\nIn our judgement, we cannot really reinvent the\r\nwheel. The issues are fairly clear. Agreement or progress\r\nwill be possible only if there is political will to make the\r\nhard decisions and undertake the necessary political\r\ncompromises in order to have a reformed Security\r\nCouncil that is democratic, equitably representative and\r\nthat truly acts on behalf of all Member States.\r\nThe foregoing is not to suggest that there were no\r\npositive developments in our deliberations during the past\r\nyear. For example, the notion of a so-called “quick fix”\r\nunder any guise has been put to rest. It is inequitable and\r\npolitically unacceptable, and I am certain that even the\r\npotential beneficiaries of such an arrangement would be\r\nuncomfortable with such an outcome. Similarly, the\r\nconcept of rotational permanent seats, even on a regional\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nbasis for developing countries, has not found favour with\r\nall Member States. There is therefore the need to revisit the\r\nconcept.\r\nThere was also the notion of a concert of medium\r\nPowers that would rotate more frequently as non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. The difficulty with that\r\noption relates to the modalities of determining membership\r\nof such a group. In any event, it would be tantamount to\r\nestablishing a third category of membership that is not\r\nrecognized by the United Nations Charter. My delegation\r\nbelieves that that option should not really be pursued.\r\nWith regard to the working methods of the Council,\r\nthere has been a great convergence of views on the need\r\nfor continued improvement, particularly in terms of\r\nimproved transparency and greater democratization of the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making procedures.\r\nOn the question of the veto, the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, in a paper that has received overwhelming\r\nsupport, has offered a view. The conclusions reached in that\r\npaper deserve the serious consideration of the current\r\npermanent members of the Security Council. In our view,\r\npermanent membership confers a privileged status that in\r\nturn implies responsibilities and obligations. It is our hope,\r\ntherefore, that the permanent members will see their way\r\nclear as to the necessity of the needed reform of the\r\nSecurity Council and extend their willing cooperation to the\r\nprocess in the interest of their own credibility, equity and\r\njustice. Until the veto is ultimately abolished, we believe\r\nthat its use should be rational and selective and confined\r\nonly to issues under Chapter VII of the Charter. Clearly, we\r\nfail to understand why, in today’s world and in terms of\r\nrealpolitik, the decision on the appointment of a Secretary-\r\nGeneral — and for that matter, the next Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization — should be subject to the preferred\r\noptions or predilections of one or two powerful Member\r\nStates. It is a question that should be considered in a fully\r\ndemocratic and transparent manner by the General\r\nAssembly so as to ensure that whoever emerges enjoys the\r\nsupport of all Member States. The same principle should\r\napply when we consider the admission of new Members.\r\nConcerning the composition and size of the Council,\r\nmy delegation continues to assert that the current anomaly\r\nof non-African representation in the permanent membership\r\ncategory deserves urgent correction, for the continent has\r\nnot only the largest number of United Nations Member\r\nStates, but those States, collectively, constitute almost one\r\nthird of the United Nations general membership. In this\r\ncontext, the collective decision of Africa to have a two-seat\r\nrepresentation in the permanent membership category\r\ndeserves the full support of all Member States. We would,\r\nhowever, wish to clarify that the modalities of that\r\nrepresentation should be left to Africa.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe Charter recognizes two categories of\r\nmembership. We believe that the proposed increases\r\nshould therefore be in these two categories, permanent\r\nand non-permanent membership, without discrimination\r\nbetween the powers of the old permanent members and\r\nthe new ones. All permanent members should enjoy the\r\nsame rights and powers and assume the responsibilities\r\nincumbent on membership. Besides, the Charter\r\nprovisions should not be amended solely to serve a short-\r\nterm purpose.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that the fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly provided an enabling momentum\r\nfor our work by further clarifying issues and concepts.\r\nOur Working Group’s deliberations should not be\r\ninterminable. We believe that the status quo in the\r\nCouncil is unrepresentative and out of tune with current\r\ninternational realities. It demands urgent collective action\r\nfor its restructuring and reform.\r\nWe therefore charge the Open-ended Working Group\r\nwith redoubling its efforts during this fifty-first session of\r\nthe General Assembly, under Mr. Razali’s distinguished\r\nchairmanship, in order to come up with concrete\r\nproposals that would address in a holistic manner, and not\r\npiecemeal, all the issues regarding an increase in\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership, working\r\nmethods of the Security Council and the question of\r\nequitable geographical distribution of seats in the Council.\r\nIt is appropriate to state that with the necessary political\r\nwill it is possible to reform and restructure the Security\r\nCouncil to meet our collective wishes and aspirations.\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium) (interpretation from French):\r\nFor three years now our Working Group has been\r\nconsidering all aspects of the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Thanks to the active participation of Member\r\nStates, under the wise guidance of our two Vice-\r\nChairmen, many proposals have been made and lengthy\r\ndiscussions have been held.\r\nAllow me to remind those who might have forgotten\r\nthat a group of Member States, including Belgium,\r\nsubmitted a document for discussion only which was\r\nreproduced in the report of the forty-ninth session. We\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nbelieve that, broadly speaking, the principles contained in\r\nthat document have lost none of their validity and are still\r\nrelevant. And we are prepared to discuss them with those\r\nwho share similar concerns.\r\nWhat are these principles? I would single out three.\r\nFirst, reform will be useful only if it leads to increased\r\nefficiency in the Security Council. Secondly, the current\r\nrepresentation of the Council no longer reflects today’s\r\nrealities and needs to be strengthened. Finally, there is a\r\nneed to restore legitimacy to the limited body that is the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nImplementation of these principles should in the longer\r\nrun allow us to agree on the following points. First,\r\nexpansion of the Security Council should take place in the\r\ntwo categories of permanent members and non-permanent\r\nmembers; in our view, this is primarily a question of\r\nbalance within the Council. Secondly, the increase in\r\npermanent and non-permanent members should be based on\r\nthe current distinction between the two categories. Thirdly,\r\nthe expanded Council should not consist of more than 25\r\nmembers. Fourthly, a limit on the usage of the veto should\r\nbe discussed. Fifthly, it should be possible to review the\r\nmembership of the Council.\r\nWe believe that it is time to move beyond the phase\r\nof discussions and exchanges of views, which, it must be\r\nadmitted, have in recent months become rather repetitive.\r\nLet us be quite clear: there is no panacea for reforming the\r\nSecurity Council. However, several aspects of the proposals\r\nsubmitted and of the ideas introduced deserve more in-\r\ndepth discussion so they can be judged on their own merits.\r\nIn our view — and this is just an example — the idea of\r\nregional representation for the category of permanent\r\nmembers, assuming that there is to be an increase in the\r\ntwo categories of members, requires further analysis, based\r\nobjectively on its advantages and disadvantages. Similarly,\r\na debate on the use of the veto or on the review of the\r\nCouncil’s composition — to take two other examples —\r\nremains necessary, if only to clarify our thinking.\r\nFinally, with regard to improving the working methods\r\nof the Council, we believe, as many others do, that real\r\nprogress has been made. However, we believe that current\r\nmeasures need to be taken farther. In particular, we need to\r\nsee to it that certain principles and certain rules of\r\ntransparency are applied. We think that such vigilance\r\nwould be more useful than requiring that the measures be\r\nformalized and institutionalized. But we see no problem in\r\nsuch formalization where it is conceivable and possible.\r\nWe really believe that, after three years of\r\ndiscussion, it is time to identify the various points that\r\nneed to be considered calmly and in greater depth and to\r\nact accordingly. We now need to move forward. The\r\ncredibility of the Organization as a whole is at stake.\r\nMr. Escovar-Salom (Venezuela) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The Declaration adopted on the occasion\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, says that\r\n“The Security Council should, inter alia, be\r\nexpanded and its working methods continue to be\r\nreviewed in a way that will further strengthen its\r\ncapacity and effectiveness, enhance its representative\r\ncharacter and improve its working efficiency and\r\ntransparency; as important differences on key issues\r\ncontinue to exist, further in-depth consideration of\r\nthese issues is required.” (Resolution 50/6,\r\nDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth\r\nAnniversary of the United Nations, para. 14)\r\nThe international community must abide by this\r\ncommitment. In this context, we express our support for\r\nthe endeavours of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nsubject now before us. We hope that soon, when we take\r\nup this work again, we will arrive at a consensus.\r\nFrom the start of the debates on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, Venezuela has reiterated its position that\r\na comprehensive approach should be taken to its\r\nrestructuring, account being taken of all dimensions of the\r\nissue, particularly in the areas of composition, decision-\r\nmaking and working methods.\r\nAs to its composition, we have advocated a\r\nmodification that would reflect the increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations and improve the\r\narrangements of 1945 in order to move towards more\r\ndemocratic formulas. Venezuela expressed this position\r\neven when the Organization was created. In this way,\r\nregional groups could be guaranteed greater\r\nrepresentation, and a more proportional and representative\r\nrelationship between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly would be established, which would greatly\r\nenhance the legitimacy of the Organization.\r\nWe consider that this increase in the membership of\r\nthe Council should apply to the category of permanent\r\nmembers as well as to that of non-permanent members. If\r\nwe do not succeed in obtaining a consensus on a\r\nstraightforward increase in the permanent membership of\r\nthe Council, we might consider a rotation among those\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\ncountries that, although not permanent members, could also\r\ncontribute actively to the taking and implementation of\r\nSecurity Council decisions. Furthermore, all the other non-\r\npermanent members should have their annual chance of\r\nassuming a seat on the Council increased.\r\nWe do not believe that only economic, political or\r\nmilitary potential should be taken into consideration in this\r\nmatter. In any case, what is set out in Article 23, paragraph\r\n1, of the United Nations Charter is still valid because of its\r\nflexibility with regard to the election of countries for the\r\ntwo existing categories, as well as with regard to the\r\npossibility of a new formula.\r\nWith regard to working methods, even though there\r\nhas been no agreement on basic aspects, progress has been\r\nmade in the search for greater transparency. We insist on\r\nthe need for the Security Council to continue to improve its\r\nprocedures, and we consider that only the comprehensive\r\nreform of the Council will lead to a real increase in its\r\nlegitimacy and efficiency.\r\nRegarding the decision-making process, my country\r\nhas, ever since it became a Member of the United Nations\r\nin 1945, been in favour of eliminating a power that was\r\ncreated in response to circumstances that no longer exist\r\ntoday. We believe that this exceptional faculty should be\r\nlimited to cases that endanger international peace and\r\nsecurity, on the basis of Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nWe appreciate the complexity of this process, but we\r\nalso must stress that if we remain bogged down in the\r\nexchange of views, the process could become an\r\ninterminable and fruitless debate that would hinder the\r\nachievement of specific agreements and risk losing the\r\nimpetus gained on this issue in recent years.\r\nVenezuela is still convinced of the need to review and\r\nmodify the structure of that organ in the light of the\r\ndemands of a changing world. It is therefore essential to\r\ncontinue the endeavours to achieve a Security Council that\r\nrepresents all regions fairly. We should demonstrate to\r\nworld public opinion our creativity in designing new\r\nformulas, as well as our political will to reach consensus in\r\na matter of such great importance. An agreement in this\r\nmatter will no doubt establish the bases for an international\r\norder of greater solidarity, ensuring the reign of law and\r\njustice.\r\nMr. Cassar (Malta): The rich diversity that has\r\ncharacterized the debate on Security Council reform is\r\nencouraging. In its report, the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and\r\nOther Matters Related to the Security Council identifies\r\nissues and problem areas. However, the dynamics within\r\nthe Group have not as yet led to common ground. Our\r\ncollective endeavours during the forty-eighth, forty-ninth\r\nand fiftieth session have not born fruit.\r\nThis fact in itself demands reflection. It indicates the\r\nimportance Member States attach to the Security\r\nCouncil’s role and to changes which have occurred and\r\nwill continue to occur in the international community.\r\nAwareness of the need to expand the Security Council to\r\nenhance its representative character is equalled by that of\r\nretaining and improving upon its efficiency. Neither of\r\nthese two basic objectives is divisive. It is in the method\r\nby which these objectives are to be pursued that\r\ndifferences exist.\r\nDebate has stimulated creativity. The benefit of the\r\ndiversity of possible options, however, is counterbalanced\r\nby the distance which still persists between national\r\npositions. The negotiating process requires of us a marked\r\neffort to bring to fruition three years of debate and\r\ndiscussion. Indeed, our shared belief in the need to\r\nexpand and enhance the efficiency of the Security Council\r\nimposes a degree of urgency in the identification of\r\nsolutions. The way forward requires flexibility and\r\ncompromise as tools. It also demands a reciprocal effort\r\nin understanding and comprehending the aspirations and\r\nthe concerns of different delegations.\r\nThe report correctly states that during discussions on\r\nthe size and composition of the Security Council,\r\n“It became clear ... that a number of Member States\r\nwere not ready to take final positions because of\r\ninterlinkages between the size and composition and\r\nother matters in the mandate of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group.” (A/50/47, para. 23)\r\nOn the question of an increase in permanent membership,\r\nmany States have retained an open mind, asking\r\nlegitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to\r\nbase such a decision, now and in the future, for any\r\ncourse of action adopted will, in fact, establish a\r\nprecedent. Can the historical realities which influenced the\r\nCouncil’s composition 50 years ago be paralleled or\r\nmatched in any way by present contingencies? Can earlier\r\nor existing proportionality justify extrapolation today?\r\nHow can factors which are non-permanent and change\r\nover time determine permanence?\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nMalta has listened attentively to the answers given to\r\nsuch questions and has taken note of the disposition of\r\nStates that have expressed a willingness to serve.\r\nRegardless of the evaluation of these answers by individual\r\nMember States, the fact remains that at present a common\r\nposition on this delicate issue appears remote. Should this\r\nimpasse block altogether the prospect of an equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council? Compromise solutions could be inspired\r\nby contemporary trends, realities and practices.\r\nWe have a number of proposals and formulas on the\r\ntable which seek to direct us to the path of compromise,\r\nwhether for arrangements for a more frequent rotation by\r\ncertain Member States, or for the expansion of the non-\r\npermanent category to reflect the number of States in each\r\nregion, or for following the precedent set in the first\r\nexpansion, when there was an equal increase in the number\r\nof non-permanent seats per regional group. The current\r\ndistance in positions could also point towards first-step\r\nsolutions, if only for now. This would help us avoid being\r\nhostage to those fundamental questions that still need to be\r\nresolved. The Non-Aligned Movement’s suggestion to\r\novercome the lack of agreement on the increase in other\r\ncategories of membership by expanding, for the time being,\r\nthe non-permanent category is an option to be borne in\r\nmind.\r\nRealpolitik can take us a step further. Expansion could\r\ntake stock of the de facto patterns of service on the\r\nCouncil, which reflect the increased role and contribution\r\nof some Member States in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. We all are conscious of the desire and\r\nwill to serve of those able to do so more regularly. Their\r\npast role and their future potential holds promise for an\r\neffective contribution to the work of the Security Council.\r\nItaly’s proposal in this regard seeks to take into account\r\nthese realities without creating new categories of\r\nmembership. Malta continues to view this proposal with\r\npositive interest, as it recognizes both the special\r\ncontribution of a number of States and the right of all\r\nStates to serve on the Council regardless of their size,\r\nwealth or military might.\r\nApart from restating the need for equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, the report also reiterates the call for\r\nimproved transparency and efficiency in the Council’s\r\nwork. Improvement of the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil cannot be underestimated. A number of measures\r\nhave already been taken to better the flow of information\r\nbetween the Council and the general membership. Such\r\nefforts enhance the relationship between the two. This is\r\nan absolute necessity, for regardless of the extent of the\r\nexpansion that may ultimately be agreed upon, at any\r\npoint in time the vast majority of Member States will not\r\nbe on the Council. Lack of information could impede that\r\nactive symbiotic relationship between the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly to which we all aspire.\r\nAn enhanced, structured process of consultation\r\nbetween these two principal organs and their members\r\nwould contribute to the transparency of the work of the\r\nCouncil and facilitate the Assembly’s effective input,\r\nparticularly in those areas or on those issues of which the\r\nCouncil has been seized for prolonged periods of time or\r\non which it has encountered difficulty in taking\r\nimmediate and effective action.\r\nThe world community can only benefit from an\r\nactively enhanced engagement of the General Assembly\r\nand its members in the search for solutions to issues of\r\nconcern, which cause suffering and distress to whole\r\npopulations of innocent victims.\r\nOur discussions on decision-making in the Council\r\nhave also led to interesting exchanges. The veto and its\r\nuse and extension have been debated extensively. Malta\r\nhas already stated that the question of veto can best be\r\nresolved by letting the veto fall into disuse without\r\nprejudicing future discussion on the desirability of its\r\nabolition. Other equally important aspects of decision-\r\nmaking deserve earnest consideration. The further\r\ninvolvement of affected States in the decision-making\r\nprocess, albeit not in the decision-making of the Council\r\nitself, would enhance the Council’s effectiveness. Such\r\nimportant exchanges as have occurred very recently have\r\nenabled interested Member States to address items of\r\nconcern to them and the Council itself to better reflect the\r\nwill of the international community it represents.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nand the central role of the Security Council are as crucial\r\nto the substance of this debate as they are to the\r\nOrganization. Most of the reforms proposed retain the\r\nrole of the Security Council as guarantor of peace, while\r\nrecognizing the need for an evolution in its membership\r\nand in its relationship with the General Assembly. The\r\nfinal outcome of this exercise must safeguard the\r\ninstitutional balance that the Charter provides.\r\nThe item before us remains delicate. The road ahead\r\nis neither simple nor easy. Through sustained effort,\r\nfuture discussions can benefit from the lessons of the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\npresent. This requires of all Member States the political will\r\nto seek common ground and build on compromise to give\r\nto the international community an expanded and enhanced\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Mtango (United Republic of Tanzania): The\r\nagenda item before us has, understandably, attracted\r\ndivergent views, positions and proposals from the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity at large. The intense and varied exchange of\r\nviews that has been going on for the last three years is\r\nclear testimony to the importance the world attaches to this\r\norgan and its role in determining the destiny of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the tremendous increase\r\nin the Organization’s membership have made the need for\r\nreform not only compelling but possible. With a\r\nmembership of 51 at the time of its inception five decades\r\nago, the United Nations had a total of six non-permanent\r\nmembers on the Security Council, representing about 12 per\r\ncent of the total membership of the Organization. With the\r\ncurrent almost fourfold increase, the percentage has further\r\ndwindled, as the present 10 non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil now represent less than 6 per cent of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations. While we all agree on\r\nthe need for reform, we have so far not reached agreement\r\non the nature and scope of the reforms to be effected. This\r\nis the crux of the matter.\r\nMy delegation has underlined that the reforms of the\r\nCouncil must be both comprehensive and continuous. This\r\nmeans that for us, the overriding objective of the reforms\r\nis to bring about the Council’s greater democratization by\r\nrestoring the balance of representation between the\r\ndeveloped North and the developing South in both\r\ncategories of membership. We see this as a process that\r\nwill bring justice and greater empowerment to the Council.\r\nFor, ultimately, if we reach agreement on a balanced\r\nexpansion of membership in both categories by reforming\r\nits working methods and its decision-making procedures,\r\nwe shall have erected a firm foundation for a dynamic,\r\nefficient and more relevant Council whose jurisdiction and\r\ndecisions will enjoy universal acceptance.\r\nThe Council today faces new and complex problems\r\nof security that were not apparent 50 years ago, or were\r\nsubsumed within the international political processes at play\r\nwithin the larger context of the cold war. Today the\r\nproblems of internal conflicts, of various potential areas of\r\ninstability and of terrorism have direct implications for\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAll these matters require new and creative\r\napproaches, including those of peacemaking, peace-\r\nbuilding and even peacekeeping. The Council therefore\r\nneeds to undergo the kinds of reforms which will make it\r\nresponsive to and capable of dealing with traditional\r\nproblems as well as these new ones. What therefore is\r\nneeded in the reforms we seek is to strengthen the\r\ncapability of the Council in handling matters of\r\ninternational peace and security. Failure to do so, or\r\ninsistence on non-reforms such as partial measures, will\r\nnot only serve to reinforce the status quo, but will also do\r\nharm to the integrity and efficiency of the Council and\r\nundermine our collective efforts.\r\nAfrica, being the most under-represented, should be\r\ngiven the highest priority since it has three non-permanent\r\nmembers, compared to, say, the Western region which has\r\na total of seven seats — four permanent members, and\r\nthree non-permanent members. Africa deserves at least\r\ntwo permanent members in the Council and also, in all\r\nfairness, an increase in the non-permanent seats.\r\nNeedless to say, the Council will have to undertake\r\nperiodic reviews of its mission, membership and working\r\nmethods, as well as continuously adjust to changing\r\ncircumstances and address itself to new needs. This is\r\nwhy we must not see the present exercise as a one-off\r\nissue, but rather as a necessary and continuing process of\r\nconsultations. Of course, the issues are difficult,\r\nespecially because they involve questioning entrenched\r\npolitical privileges of some of our countries, and the\r\npossibility of limited devolution of some prerogatives.\r\nThis notwithstanding, we must persevere and not succumb\r\nto the easy but temporary options of abandoning the\r\nreform process or to the temptation of partial measures.\r\nUltimately, humanity in its entirety has a legitimate right\r\nto ask for involvement in decisions that affect its well-\r\nbeing and its future.\r\nLinked to the expansion of membership is the\r\nquestion of the Council’s methods of work, including its\r\ndecision-making procedures. Increasingly, decisions are\r\nbeing taken by a few permanent members of the Council,\r\nthus steadily moving us away from the lofty ideals\r\nenshrined in Article 24 of the Charter. We have\r\nrepeatedly pointed out the imperative of bringing about\r\ngreater democratization of the methods of decision-\r\nmaking and allowing for greater transparency. We take\r\nnote of the efforts made to pull the Council from the\r\nshroud of secrecy, but those efforts have only scratched\r\nthe surface. Decision-making remains the prerogative of\r\na few, often without giving the general membership the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nchance to contribute to the making of those decisions.\r\nEqually, the working procedures and their resultant\r\ndecisions remain subservient to the political prerogative of\r\nthe permanent members and without the rigour of justice or\r\nconsistency.\r\nThe wind of change which has swept across the world\r\nhas reinvigorated the democratization process. Democracy,\r\ntransparency, good governance and accountability have\r\nbecome the pillars upon which the Governments of most\r\nMember States are anchored. Given the expansion and\r\ndeepening of democracy at the national level, we should\r\nexpect to see a corresponding embrace of the ideals of the\r\nsystem at the international level, and certainly within the\r\nUnited Nations. This is why it is a contradiction in terms to\r\nsee rigidity and arguments for preserving the status quo in\r\nthe United Nations system for decision-making mechanisms\r\non critical issues, including the question of the veto. The\r\nveto power, flawed in principle as it was and remains, may\r\nhave had a useful purpose during the cold war era, but with\r\nthe improved international environment and, indeed, the\r\nincrease of diplomatic avenues to resolve differences, the\r\ncontinued existence of the veto is as undemocratic as it is\r\nirrelevant. We must now have a clear resolve to liberate the\r\nUnited Nations from this obsolete and undemocratic legacy\r\nof the cold war.\r\nReforms must not only be real, but must also be just\r\nand equitable. Because the Security Council acts on behalf\r\nof the general membership of the United Nations, full\r\nconsideration should be given to the aspirations and\r\ninterests of developing countries, which account for the\r\nmajority of the United Nations membership. In this respect,\r\nthe Assembly, being the most representative of all United\r\nNations bodies, ought to be vested with the most authority\r\nand responsibility. After all, is this not the essence of\r\ndemocracy? Greater accountability of the Council to the\r\nAssembly should move from the realm of theory to a\r\npartnership in facing the new challenges of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nCollective security requires the Council to be a\r\ngenuine representative in terms of equitable geographical\r\nparticipation and for it to cease being an instrument for\r\nenforcing policies of an exclusive club. Its members should\r\ntry to seek the widest support possible in the process of\r\nreaching decisions.\r\nOur ultimate objective in pursuing these reforms is to\r\nbring about a democratic, representative, dynamic and\r\nrevitalized Security Council which will be more relevant to\r\nthe common problems we all face. The new Council will\r\nthen be able to seek the partnership of all Member States,\r\nespecially through the General Assembly, in taking\r\ndecisions by majority consent. That is the ideal we should\r\naim for.\r\nMy delegation understands, however, that it will not\r\nbe easy to reach that objective of democracy, the abolition\r\nof the veto and expanded representation as soon as we\r\nwish. This is why we are of the strong view that the\r\nlarger part of the membership of the United Nations ought\r\nto be represented in an expanded manner, especially in\r\nthe permanent category of membership so that, from\r\nwithin, the developing countries can contribute to the\r\nprocess of reform of the Council.\r\nWe have every reason to believe that Member States\r\nwill have the political courage to go the extra mile in\r\nfavour of a credible and equitably representative new\r\nCouncil. Reforms that do not meet the aspirations of the\r\nmajority will only perpetuate mistrust and frustration\r\namong Member States, thus working against the tide of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nMr. Sychou (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nOne of the most topical and important issues now being\r\nconsidered by the United Nations is the question of the\r\nreform of the Security Council, the increase in its\r\nmembership, the strengthening of the proportional\r\nrepresentation of regions and the improvement of the\r\nworking methods and procedures of the organ primarily\r\nresponsible for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe current membership of the Council reflects the\r\noutcome of the last reform of this body 33 years ago, in\r\n1963. Clearly, much has changed since then and, as a\r\nnumber of statements have pointed out, the current system\r\nalready seems less ideal than it did in the 1960s. In fact,\r\nit has resulted in a situation in which almost 80 countries\r\nhave never participated in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil and about 40, including a number of founding\r\nMembers of the Organization, have participated only\r\nonce.\r\nThere are many other aspects of the work of the\r\nSecurity Council that the majority of Member countries of\r\nthe Organization find unsatisfactory. They include an\r\nimbalance in the representation of regional groups in the\r\nCouncil; insufficient transparency in its working methods;\r\nthe influence of the national interests of a number of\r\nleading members of the Council on questions that affect\r\nthe interests of all the other Member States of the United\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nNations; the high price of the right of veto; the negative\r\nside effects the sanctions regimes imposed by the Council\r\nhave on the civilian populations of countries indirectly\r\naffected and on the economies of third countries; the failure\r\nof a number of peacekeeping operations; and several others.\r\nThe reform aims to eliminate these deficiencies.\r\nThe reform is not designed merely to inform Member\r\nStates of decisions adopted by the Security Council, but\r\nreally to ensure the broad participation of all countries in\r\nthis process. Given the serious differences of position\r\nbetween groups of countries and individual Member States\r\non a whole range of the most important aspects of the\r\nreform of the Security Council, the process of reforming\r\nthis organ should commence with those elements of reform\r\nthat are supported by most States.\r\nDuring the recent round of negotiations and\r\nconsultations in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council, which is entrusted with\r\nconsideration of this question and the drafting of\r\ncorresponding recommendations on it, a number of\r\nproposals were made on possible ways to reform the\r\nSecurity Council. As the Assembly knows, positions focus\r\non three basic approaches to the problem. First, reform\r\nshould lead to an expansion of the category of permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council. Secondly, reform should\r\nbe limited to expansion of the category of non-permanent\r\nmember of the Council, without any expansion of the\r\ncategory of permanent membership. Thirdly, the expansion\r\nof the Council should cover both permanent and non-\r\npermanent membership while the working methods of the\r\nCouncil, including the use and scope of the right of veto,\r\nare improved. At the same time, it is quite clear that, unless\r\nagreement is reached on expanding the membership of the\r\nCouncil, it will be impossible or extremely difficult to\r\nresolve any other question relating to the work of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn September this year, on the eve of the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly, the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup adopted a report which, in our opinion, for the first\r\ntime over the last three years covers virtually all aspects of\r\nthe problem spelled out in its full title. We cannot fail to\r\nrecognize that this was largely brought about by the\r\nimportant fact that the Security Council has recently\r\nadopted a number of steps to improve both its interaction\r\nwith States that are not members of the Council and its\r\nworking methods. We support a further strengthening of the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the Members\r\nof the Organization as a whole. It is hard to imagine any\r\nreference to the Security Council as an organ that acts on\r\nbehalf of all States Members of the United Nations\r\nwithout this kind of close relationship.\r\nIt is characteristic that, at this stage, most United\r\nNations Member States, including Belarus, place\r\nparticular emphasis on the problem of the equitable and\r\nbalanced distribution of seats in the Security Council and\r\nStates’ increased participation in its work. The positive\r\nside of a number of proposals made during the thorough\r\ndiscussion on an increase of the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council this year is the desire to find a balance\r\namong the interests of all groups of countries.\r\nIt is appropriate to recall that the membership of the\r\nEastern European Group has almost tripled in recent\r\nyears. It is no coincidence that, in the summary of\r\ndiscussions contained in the report that the Working\r\nGroup submitted to the General Assembly, it is reported\r\nthat:\r\n“The view was expressed that expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council should also take into account the\r\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations by\r\ncountries belonging to Eastern Europe in the context\r\nof an overall equitable geographical distribution.”\r\n(A/50/47, para. 24)\r\nThus, more and more Member States are recognizing\r\nthat, as things stand today, any increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council would be counter-\r\nproductive if it did not take account of the interests of the\r\nEastern European Group. While we support this report as\r\na whole, we express the hope that this factor, which has\r\nbeen finally recognized by a majority of Member States\r\nwill be developed further and logically in all the future\r\nactivities of the Working Group. From the very outset, we\r\nhave stressed and are prepared to stress again and again\r\nthat Security Council reform is possible only if the\r\nlegitimate interests of all groups of countries are taken\r\ninto account, since it would be difficult to go along with\r\nany decision that would exacerbate the present\r\ndisproportionate membership in this body.\r\nIn their turn, regional groups should establish\r\nmechanisms for rotation, in accordance with the universal\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution of seats in\r\nthe Council, not only among but also within regional\r\ngroups. When reaching regional agreements on proposing\r\ncandidacies for non-permanent membership in the\r\nSecurity Council, such important factors as the ability of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\napplicant countries to contribute to the strengthening of\r\ninternational peace and security should be taken into\r\naccount. In the light of current priorities, particular attention\r\nshould be given to countries that make a significant,\r\ngenerally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to\r\nstrengthen regional and global security by carrying out their\r\nobligations under the major disarmament agreements and\r\ntreaties in this area.\r\nNevertheless, there is still not enough awareness of the\r\nproblem of equitable geographical distribution in reforming\r\nthe Security Council and attempts are being made to solve\r\nthe problems of one group of countries at the expense of or\r\nby circumventing others. The report of the Working Group\r\non the results of its work for this year and the atmosphere\r\nin which it was adopted at the final stage of its work speak\r\nvolumes about how far we still need to go before we reach\r\nconsensus, without which the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil will just not work.\r\nMr. Valencia Rodríguez (Ecuador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I wish first to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for his\r\nchairmanship of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nissue before us, and to Ambassador Breitenstein and\r\nAmbassador Jayanama for their enormous efforts as Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Group.\r\nAlthough the Ecuadorian position is widely known by\r\nthe General Assembly and the Working Group, I believe it\r\nis necessary to reiterate its basic aspects. Our position can\r\nbe summed up as follows.\r\nFirst, Ecuador considers it necessary to increase the\r\nmembership of the Security Council in both categories,\r\npermanent and non-permanent, since its composition must\r\nreflect the current number of United Nations Members and\r\nnew political realities. Secondly, an increase in the number\r\nof permanent seats must be conditioned on the admission to\r\nthat category of one country from each region of the\r\ndeveloping world: Africa, Asia and Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean. Thirdly, Ecuador opposes the maintenance of\r\nthe veto privilege, considering it to be an anti-democratic\r\nand obsolete mechanism that does not reflect new global\r\nrealities. If it is not possible to eliminate the veto, Ecuador\r\nsuggested that its exercise be limited to cases under Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter. Fourthly, if an agreement on an increase\r\nin the membership in both categories cannot be reached, we\r\nshould promote an increase in the number of non-\r\npermanent members, as the Council cannot continue with\r\na totally defective anti-democratic composition. To that end,\r\nthere are several proposals that could serve as a basis, of\r\nwhich we wish to highlight the Italian proposal.\r\nI believe, without prejudice to this position, that\r\ncertain criteria could be considered for the sole purpose\r\nof examining effective possibilities for resolving this\r\nparticular question, in which all delegations have special\r\ninterest. As mentioned by other speakers, the report of the\r\nWorking Group contains 18 written proposals, apart from\r\nall verbal suggestions and initiatives presented during the\r\nconsideration of this item in the General Assembly and in\r\nthe Working Group. There has not even been the\r\nbeginning of an agreement on these proposals, suggestions\r\nand initiatives, and for this reason the Group confined\r\nitself to recommending the continued study of this matter\r\nin 1997, bearing in mind the progress, if it can be called\r\nprogress, achieved during the forty-eighth, forty-ninth and\r\nfiftieth sessions, as well as during the current session.\r\nIn these circumstances, everything seems to indicate\r\nthat we may hear yet again the repetition of widely\r\nknown arguments and positions, which will not lead us to\r\nresults. Therefore, I believe it is time to search for a\r\npractical solution through the Working Group’s future\r\nefforts based on this debate in plenary. Such a solution\r\ncould be attained through the development of an\r\nintegrated negotiating package to be adopted by\r\nconsensus, which is the only way of ensuring its viability.\r\nThat package should take into consideration those aspects\r\nthat have majority backing and should be based\r\nfundamentally on the new global political and juridical\r\nrealities, including the serious and undeniable\r\ncircumstances that make it difficult to reform the Charter.\r\nThe negotiating package could be composed of the\r\nfollowing six basic elements. First, the number of\r\npermanent members could be increased on the basis of\r\nthe aforementioned criteria, which is to say, on the basis\r\nof the considerable support enjoyed by candidates. That\r\nwould mean that up to five new permanent members\r\ncould be added, taking into consideration the contribution\r\nof the candidates to the essential aims of the\r\nOrganization. Secondly, the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers could be increased in such a way as to maintain\r\na proper balance between permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers, while at the same time producing a total\r\nmembership of the Council that would ensure\r\neffectiveness and efficiency in its procedures. That\r\nincrease could entail seven new members. Thirdly, in\r\naccordance with the Charter, it must be recognized that\r\ndiscriminatory distinctions or criteria should not be\r\napplied to the various permanent members with regard to\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nthe exercise of rights and obligations. Fourthly, there should\r\nbe a commitment on the part of all permanent members,\r\nthrough a declaration, to restrict exercise of the veto to\r\ncases under Chapter VII of the Charter. As this instrument\r\ncannot be modified through a declaration, that commitment\r\nwould be more a pledge of intention. Fifthly, the adoption\r\nof norms of procedure that effectively ensure transparency\r\nand democratization in all aspects of the functions and\r\nactivities of the Security Council, a matter on which there\r\nis ample room for consensus among all delegations. Sixthly,\r\nthis package could be reviewed after 15 to 20 years, to\r\ndetermine changes necessary in the light of the new global\r\nrealities.\r\nDelegations should make a serious effort to review the\r\ncontents of this negotiating package, inspired by a firm\r\npolitical will to make concessions that might seem very\r\nsizeable to many countries, but that in the end will yield\r\nconsiderable results.\r\nHowever, everyone is aware of the difficulties\r\ninvolved in the preparation and adoption by consensus of\r\nsuch a negotiating package. Should it prove too difficult,\r\nthe only alternative would be to look to an increase in the\r\nnon-permanent member category alone, together with the\r\nadoption of norms that ensure the transparency and\r\ndemocratization of the Council’s procedures.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): On behalf of the delegation of the United\r\nArab Emirates, I wish to express our gratitude to the\r\nChairman of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council, as well as to the two Vice-\r\nChairmen for their efforts to reach a positive solution\r\nconducive to strengthening the role of the Security Council\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe gratitude of the international community for the\r\nimportant role played by the Security Council in containing\r\nmany regional conflicts and civil wars in recent years has\r\nhighlighted the urgent need to change and increase the\r\nCouncil’s role in line with a new concept — democratic\r\nrepresentation, reflecting the greater balance in international\r\nrelations — through the reform and expansion of its\r\nmembership. This is one of the priority issues for States\r\nafter the end of the cold war.\r\nAlthough there is international unanimity on the need\r\nto reform the composition of the Council as part of the\r\noverall process of United Nations reform, the debate has\r\nnevertheless highlighted some differences between\r\nMember States with regard to the best way to implement\r\nthe desired reforms. The agreement that has been reached\r\nin principle in the Working Group may be considered an\r\nappropriate basis for continuing serious negotiations\r\nbetween States to enable us to create a realistic vision\r\nreflecting the changes in the contemporary world and the\r\nneed for democracy, justice and transparency, while\r\nensuring that Council enlargement and other reforms will\r\nnot have a negative impact on the Council’s work or on\r\nits task of maintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports\r\nthe positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly, which,\r\ninter alia, stressed that the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil should not result in an increase in the number of\r\npermanent members from developed countries at the\r\nexpense of the developing countries, but that the principle\r\nof equitable geographical representation should be\r\nrespected, as well as the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of States.\r\nThe attainment of that goal requires the international\r\ncommunity to find an appropriate objective formula to\r\ngive the developing countries, which represent the\r\nmajority of the Member States of the United Nations, the\r\nopportunity of participating in processes for decision-\r\nmaking and for working out general strategies to meet\r\ncurrent needs so as to serve the goals of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nReform, and the formalization of the working\r\nmethods of the Council, can realistically be brought about\r\nonly if we consider the entire decision-making process,\r\nwhich is still, to this day, characterized by two main\r\npractices: consultations and the use of the veto. These\r\npractices have created double standards in some of the\r\nCouncil’s work. There has been a lack of transparency\r\nwith regard to attaining the general goal of peace. As the\r\nissues that the Council deals with are extremely\r\nimportant — they relate directly to peace and the interests\r\nof the countries concerned — the delegation of the United\r\nArab Emirates supports all the efforts and initiatives that\r\nseek to expand the basis on which consultations take\r\nplace between members and non-members of the Council,\r\nas well as regional organizations and other countries\r\nconcerned, before decisions are taken.\r\nWe must also find objective criteria for the use of\r\nthe veto to ensure that appropriate decisions are taken for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, fully\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nrespecting the sovereignty of States and their territorial\r\nintegrity, security and stability in accordance with\r\ninternational law and the provisions of the Charter. The\r\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates emphasizes the\r\nneed for an objective, general assessment of the principle\r\nof Council enlargement in keeping with equitable\r\ngeographical representation. We must also introduce\r\nreforms in the rules and practices of the Council in\r\naccordance with paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the Charter,\r\nas well as with Article 23.\r\nAs security and political problems are directly tied to\r\neconomic and social issues, the international community\r\nshould enhance coordination between the Security Council\r\nand the other main organs of the United Nations, especially\r\nthe General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the International Court of Justice, so as to ensure their\r\neffective participation through political and legal\r\nconsultations to enable a flow of information between them.\r\nThis would promote confidence-building for the resolution\r\nof conflicts and situations of aggression through peaceful\r\nmeans, thereby creating a climate of tolerance and peaceful\r\ncoexistence.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of the United Arab\r\nEmirates hopes that discussions in the Working Group will\r\nbe successful, and that consensus will be reached so that\r\nthe Security Council can play its role and shoulder\r\nincreased responsibilities for the maintenance of peace,\r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nMr. Takht-Ravanchi (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nSince the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council began its work, different\r\naspects of Security Council reform have been considered.\r\nIn its very difficult and delicate task, the Working Group\r\nwas guided by the tireless efforts of the co-Vice-Chairmen\r\nof the Group, to whom my delegation would like to pay\r\ntribute.\r\nIn previous years, and during the various meetings of\r\nthe Working Group, many delegations, including my own,\r\nhave expressed their positions and offered proposals on the\r\nreform of the Council. The report of the Working Group to\r\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly, contained in\r\ndocument A/50/47, reflects the thrust of the Group’s\r\ndeliberations. This is not, therefore, the time to repeat what\r\nwe have already said in the meetings of the Working\r\nGroup. Having said that, I should like to state that my\r\ndelegation wishes to express support for the observations\r\nmade by the Ambassador of Colombia on behalf of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe need for the Council to be more representative\r\nand much more transparent, effective, accountable to\r\nMember States and democratic is a given. Furthermore,\r\nthe establishment of a new balance between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council by filling the existing\r\ngap between Member States and the Council is vital. The\r\nCouncil should ensure the participation of Member States\r\nin the decision-making process so that its moral\r\nlegitimacy may be fully retained.\r\nOf equal importance is the view of the large\r\nmajority of Member States that there is a need to curtail\r\nand rationalize the veto power, for it is now more clear\r\nthan ever before that that privilege has really lost its\r\nraison d’être. In our view, it is now time to appraise the\r\npast and prepare the ground for progress in the future\r\ndeliberations of the Working Group, which is to continue\r\nits work.\r\nMy delegation believes that the discussions on the\r\nreform of the Security Council have so far been useful.\r\nThe discussions on the issue in the Working Group and\r\nother forums have, to a large extent, clarified various\r\naspects of the question on the agenda, delineating both\r\nconvergences and divergences of views. It is now evident\r\nthat progress in Security Council reform depends to a\r\nlarge extent on strong political will on the part of all\r\nMembers, and particularly the permanent members of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nOn the other hand, the discussions to date have\r\nrevealed some of the flaws and deficiencies of the\r\nCouncil, especially in its working methods. Some of those\r\nflaws have been inherent in the Council since its creation.\r\nIn response to the discussions held, the Security Council\r\nhas taken some incremental steps to improve its working\r\nmethods. Those steps should be institutionalized and\r\nfurther initiatives should be taken in light of the\r\nsuggestions and proposals introduced by Member States\r\nto improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThere is general agreement that the membership of\r\nthe Security Council should be expanded to ensure\r\nequitable and balanced representation. At the present time,\r\nthe developing countries are under-represented. To make\r\nthe Council more representative, various proposals have\r\nbeen introduced, each representing a philosophical\r\nviewpoint and/or the interests of certain Members. Unlike\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nthe question of reform of the Council’s working methods,\r\nwhich has met with only sporadic opposition from some of\r\nthe permanent members of the Council, the question of\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council is more complex\r\nand controversial. The emergent view, which seems to point\r\nto a way out of this dilemma, is to proceed to an increase\r\nin the non-permanent membership of the Council as the\r\nfirst phase of this process. Of course, the discussions on the\r\nsecond phase — that is, other issues in Cluster I — should\r\ncontinue until a final result is achieved.\r\nAs the organ on which the Member States have\r\nconferred the primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the Security Council’s\r\ndecisions affect every Member of the Organization in one\r\nway or another. Therefore, the process of the Council’s\r\ndecision-making and the composition of its decision-makers\r\nare of paramount importance to Member States. Similarly,\r\nthe participation of all Members in the process of the\r\nCouncil’s reform is both important and a source of\r\ncredibility for the Organization as a whole. For its part, my\r\ndelegation is ready to continue to follow and to participate\r\nin the future work on the reform of the Security Council\r\nwith a great deal of interest and enthusiasm.\r\nMr. Vilchez Asher (Nicaragua) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am speaking on behalf of the countries of\r\nCentral America participating in this debate on the question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and other related\r\nmatters. We participate because we are a group of small\r\ncountries that belong to a region that is not sufficiently\r\nrepresented in the Council and we feel a responsibility to\r\nexpress our position on what the Security Council should be\r\nin the next century.\r\nThe report of the Working Group before us is of\r\nfundamental importance because it affords us an\r\nopportunity to analyse and evaluate the prevailing\r\nconsensus on a considerable number of the points we have\r\nbeen discussing for a long time now.\r\nThe Central American delegations wish to express\r\ntheir appreciation to the Vice-Chairmen of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group and to take this opportunity to note that the\r\nGroup’s mandate has been satisfactorily implemented. This\r\nyear, considerable progress has been achieved. We have all\r\nhad an opportunity to express our views in the Working\r\nGroup and our hopes to arrive at a truly representative\r\nSecurity Council, one that, in addition to fulfilling its\r\nmandate to examine issues that pose a threat to international\r\npeace and security, will be possessed of effective, dynamic\r\nand transparent working methods and function in\r\ncoordination with both the General Assembly and the\r\nother organs of the United Nations.\r\nFor Central America, which has in the past benefited\r\nfrom the work of the Security Council, in coordination\r\nwith the General Assembly and other United Nations\r\norgans, it is of singular importance that the membership\r\nof the Security Council be enlarged. As the report notes,\r\nthe Council must reflect the opinion of the vast majority\r\nof States, including those of our region, and there must be\r\nan increase in both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership. Here, we would emphasize the right of\r\ndeveloping countries to be represented in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent memberships of the\r\nCouncil in order to maintain an overall balance in its\r\nmembership.\r\nA balanced increase in Security Council membership\r\nhas become imperative. If it is not accomplished before\r\nthe twenty-first century, we will not have acted in keeping\r\nwith the new composition of the United Nations or with\r\nthe changes demanded by the new world situation. As we\r\nsee it, Article 23 of the Charter remains fully valid,\r\nbecause it contains a broad and flexible approach that\r\naccurately reflects the importance of the equitable\r\ngeographical balance and distribution that should prevail\r\nin the Organization.\r\nWe believe that the cards are now on the table and\r\nthat the time has now come to pursue serious and\r\nconstructive negotiations. We are sure that the voices of\r\nall the Member States that have participated throughout\r\nthese years of work cannot continue to be ignored by the\r\nfive permanent members of the Council and we are\r\npersuaded that their response to all of this endeavour will\r\nbe positive.\r\nIn recent years, the work of the Security Council has\r\ngrown in tandem with the number of conflicts it has\r\nexamined. This has demonstrated the relevance of a\r\nCouncil that, when taking its decisions, must be sure that\r\nit possesses all the elements of analysis and opinion that\r\nwill enable it to act in accordance with the Charter, with\r\ndue respect for the sovereignty and integrity of States and\r\non behalf of the peoples of the world, as set forth in the\r\nCharter.\r\nThe United Nations has its roots in the immediate\r\npast, the end of the Second World War, and was\r\nestablished to avoid another armed conflict of equal or\r\ngreater proportions. Its fundamental objectives depend on\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nthe unity of the great Powers and on their responsibility for\r\nthe establishment of world peace, security and order.\r\nNonetheless, the founders of the Organization did not\r\nforesee the magnitude and scope of the conflict between\r\ntwo antagonistic blocs or the influence it would have on\r\ninternational relations in the post-war period; the structure,\r\nfinancing and strength of the United Nations were based on\r\nthe criteria of the security, power and national interests of\r\nthe great Powers. This was most particularly reflected in the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council, which was seen as the\r\nOrganization’s focal point.\r\nThe Security Council was formally granted broad\r\npowers to extend its mandate in the face of any threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, giving the impression that\r\nthe principle of collective security is a reality.\r\nUnfortunately, however, the confrontational nature of great-\r\nPower relations and the demand for privileges in order to\r\nrealize divergent objectives and interests revealed a\r\ndifferent reality. The Council fell captive to power politics,\r\nregrettably consecrated in Article 27 of the Charter, a\r\ncontradiction of Article 2, paragraph 1, which established\r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States. This\r\nsituation has prevailed in the United Nations ever since its\r\ncreation.\r\nToday, with an increase in the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations to 185 and as a result of the profound\r\nchanges in international society, there has been a movement\r\namong Member States regarding the need to expand the\r\nCouncil so that it reflects not only the increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations but also other questions\r\nrelated to its functioning. The goal is to strengthen its\r\ncapacity and effectiveness, democratize its decisions and\r\nimprove its relations with States that do not belong to the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn this globalized and interdependent world, an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council should be based\r\non Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Charter, which stipulates\r\nthat\r\n“The Organization is based on the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of all its Members.”\r\nWe therefore consider it vitally important that the reform be\r\nthe result of broad political consensus that reflects the will\r\nof the majority. Taking this into account, Central America\r\nbelieves that the decision-making process in the Council\r\nshould be one of the fundamental aspects of any\r\ncomprehensive reform.\r\nThe Council acts on the basis of Article 24 of the\r\nCharter, which clearly specifies that its primary\r\nresponsibility is to take action when international peace\r\nand security are threatened. It is in deciding whether a\r\nsituation really constitutes a threat to international peace\r\nand security that the Security Council must act with great\r\ncaution and that it must make a very careful analysis of\r\nthe situation. We have the impression — and this worries\r\nus — that in this decision-making process the Security\r\nCouncil has fallen into a dangerous generalization as to\r\nwhat constitutes a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nPractice has shown that now that we turn more\r\nfrequently to the Council to seek solutions to any conflict,\r\noften other mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, which Chapter VI of the Charter makes\r\navailable, are forgotten. Central America — which has\r\nmade full use of all political and diplomatic negotiating\r\nmethods, and which has turned to the International Court\r\nof Justice and international law to resolve its differences\r\nand to find solutions to all sorts of regional problems —\r\nconsiders that such options should be given priority\r\nbefore deciding to establish any peacekeeping operation.\r\nCentral America has been following the work of the\r\nWorking Group and therefore appreciates the contents of\r\nthe report it has submitted to us recently. There are\r\ncertain proposals or positions annexed to the report that\r\nthe Group felt should be taken into consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In that connection, we welcome the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement’s annex on the question of the\r\nveto. Central America, like the great majority of\r\nMembers, is of the opinion that at the present time the\r\nveto has lost its raison d’être and that ideally it should be\r\ncompletely eliminated. Nonetheless, realistically, since it\r\nwould be extremely difficult to achieve that, we believe\r\nthat the Non-Aligned Movement’s proposal offers a viable\r\nalternative which should be given great attention by this\r\nAssembly. In this respect, we agree with those who have\r\nmade concrete proposals to restrict the veto to Chapter\r\nVII. And once again we express the opinion of Central\r\nAmerica that the effectiveness of the Council in fulfilling\r\nits mandate depends to a great extent on the legitimacy of\r\nits decisions. The use of the veto limits the Council’s\r\nresponsibility when it acts on behalf of all Members of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nCentral America welcomes this debate, which is\r\ndevoted to the analysis of a subject that has been on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly for some years now.\r\nThis exercise is one of the most important in the entire\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nprocess of reform and strengthening of the United Nations.\r\nWe therefore hope that through this process an effective\r\ncontribution will be made to adapting the United Nations to\r\nthe changing international system. We hope that the\r\nSecurity Council will thus respond to the aspirations of\r\nthose who signed the Charter of the United Nations, which\r\nis the source of the commitment to maintain peace in a\r\ncollective manner and not for the benefit or in the interest\r\nof any State in particular. This will be possible if we create\r\na renewed Council which responds to the interests of all\r\nMember States in accordance with the ideals set forth in the\r\nCharter.\r\nIn conclusion, it is important to emphasize that\r\nCouncil reform is just one of the elements of the intricate\r\nprocess of United Nations reform, and that it should not be\r\naccomplished to the detriment of other key aspects that are\r\nalso of global interest. In this process we can unhesitatingly\r\naffirm that, in the universe of difficulties confronting us,\r\nthe problems of comprehensive and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are our greatest challenge because of their\r\nclose links to international peace, security and progress.\r\nPeace, development and security are three concepts that are\r\ntotally interdependent and that reinforce each other. For this\r\nreason, the process of reform must not detract from the due\r\nimportance to be given to an analysis of development issues\r\nand to the solution of the serious, related problems. In this\r\nconnection, it is important to maintain a balance between\r\nefforts to reform the Security Council and other initiatives\r\nto make the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council more effective as well as to strengthen\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nMr. Bune (Fiji): The reform of the Security Council\r\nhas been the subject of our consideration for the last three\r\nyears. During that time, an Open-ended Working Group has\r\ncarried out deliberations on the matter. The Group has been\r\nunable to come up with definitive proposals for the reform\r\nof the Council. Nevertheless, the Group was able to agree\r\non a number of areas that should be addressed in any\r\nreform programme. The Group reaffirmed its agreement\r\nthat the Council should be expanded to ensure equitable\r\ngeographical distribution, taking into account the substantial\r\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations —\r\nespecially the increased membership of developing\r\ncountries — as well as important changes in international\r\nrelations. Views on the nature of the expansion differed.\r\nThere was also a divergence of opinion on the veto power\r\nexercised by permanent members, and on the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its gratitude to\r\nthe Working Group for its work and for its report. The\r\nfact that the Group was unable to come up with definite\r\nand concrete proposals is not surprising. The issue is a\r\ndelicate and sensitive one and lies at the very heart of\r\ninternational relations and the nexus of the global political\r\npower structure.\r\nFiji’s position on the question of the enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council is well known. We support an\r\nincrease in the permanent as well as in the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Council. Since 1965, when the\r\nmembership of the present Council was last reviewed,\r\nthere have been profound changes in the international\r\ngeopolitical situation arising from the success of the\r\ndecolonization process and the end of the cold war era.\r\nMembership of the United Nations has increased steadily\r\nover the years to a total of 185 as of today. Regrettably,\r\nno corresponding change has been made to the\r\ncomposition of the Council to address the present\r\ninequities in the representation and geographic distribution\r\nof its membership.\r\nMy own country, Fiji, has been a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations for the last 26 years, since it became\r\nindependent in 1970. For the last 18 years, we have\r\ncontributed troops and civilian policemen to a majority of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. Unfortunately, as\r\na small Pacific island country on the fringe of the Asian\r\nGroup to which we belong at present, Fiji is one of the\r\n77 Member States that are still denied the opportunity to\r\nserve in the Council because of the absence of an\r\nequitable rotation system.\r\nFiji was the first South Pacific island country to join\r\nthe United Nations, in 1970, five years after the\r\nmembership of the present Council was revised. Today,\r\nthere are 14 independent sovereign island States in the\r\nPacific region, 8 of which are Members of the United\r\nNations. In addition, there are seven overseas and Non-\r\nSelf-Governing Territories in the region. Those 14 Pacific\r\nisland nations have formed a regional organization with\r\nAustralia and New Zealand for economic and political\r\ncooperation, known as the South Pacific Forum. Our total\r\npopulation is well over 25 million, making it a significant\r\nsubregional group by itself. As a regional organization,\r\nthe Forum enjoys observer status with the United Nations.\r\nIn the same way that the Caribbean is recognized as a\r\ndistinct subregion of the Latin American regional group,\r\nthe South Pacific would like to be recognized as a distinct\r\nsubregion of the Asian group. This distinct identity is not\r\nnew and is already recognized in the United Nations\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nsystem by the new designation adopted by the Economic\r\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.\r\nIt is therefore the humble submission of my country\r\nthat, based on the United Nations principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of all its Members, of universality of\r\nmembership, and of equitable geographical representation,\r\nthe South Pacific region, which includes the island nations\r\nalong with Australia and New Zealand, should be\r\nrecognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of\r\nregional representation and membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. The breakup of the former Soviet Union following\r\nthe end of the cold war also gave rise to a dramatic\r\nincrease in the membership of the Eastern European group.\r\nAny expansion of the Council should therefore take into\r\naccount this new political reality.\r\nIn order to address the current imbalanced regional\r\nrepresentation and to ensure broader representation of\r\ndeveloping countries in the Council, my delegation would\r\nlike to propose that the non-permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil be increased from 10 to 17, as follows: Africa and\r\nAsia, an increase from the present five to nine; Eastern\r\nEurope, from the present one to two; Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, from the present two to three; and Western\r\nEuropean and other States, from the present two to three.\r\nIn keeping with the principle of equitable geographical\r\nand regional representation, my delegation would further\r\npropose the following geographical distribution of these\r\nnon-permanent seats. Within the African group, one seat\r\neach could be allocated to southern Africa, western Africa,\r\neastern Africa, central Africa and the League of Arab\r\nStates. Within the Asian group, one seat each could be\r\nallocated to South Asia, West Asia, East Asia, and the\r\nSouth Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand. Within\r\nthe Latin American group, one seat each could be allocated\r\nto South America, Central America and the Caribbean.\r\nFinally, the group of Western European and other States\r\ncould be allocated three seats and the Eastern European\r\ngroup could be allocated two seats. This would make a total\r\nof 17 non-permanent seats.\r\nWhile we respect the right of each region and\r\nsubregion to decide how these non-permanent seats should\r\nbe distributed among their membership, my delegation\r\nbelieves that the only way to ensure an equitable and wider\r\nrepresentation of the membership is through the adoption by\r\nregions and subregions of an equitable rotation system. We\r\nalso support the retention of the ban on immediate re-\r\nelection.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposal that the\r\npermanent membership of the Council be increased by\r\ntwo, and that the two additional seats should be taken up\r\nby Germany and Japan. We would also be prepared to\r\nsupport consideration of one permanent seat each for\r\nAfrica and Latin America and the Caribbean in order to\r\nmake the group of permanent members more\r\nrepresentative. However, for the permanent seats, we\r\nbelieve that in addition to the criteria in the Charter, the\r\nprincipal consideration should be the political, economic\r\nand diplomatic weight of the Member State concerned.\r\nMy delegation believes that our proposals on the size\r\nof the permanent membership and on the size and\r\ngeographical composition of the non-permanent\r\nmembership are a material and proper approach to the\r\nreform of the Security Council if the Council is to\r\ncontinue to have credibility as an institution which is\r\nrepresentative of the international community as a whole\r\nand which therefore has the legal and moral authority to\r\nact on its behalf. It cannot claim to be such an\r\norganization if it continues to be a club of permanent\r\nmembers and those non-permanent members who have a\r\nlock on Council seats, getting themselves re-elected\r\nrepeatedly while denying the opportunity to others from\r\ntheir regional groups.\r\nOn the matter of the veto, my delegation is of the\r\nview that the veto power should be eliminated. However,\r\ntaking into account the current realities of international\r\nrelations, my delegation would support, as an initial step\r\nin that direction, the proposal that the scope and use of\r\nthe veto should be limited and should apply only to\r\nmeasures taken under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nMy delegation additionally wishes to propose that if\r\na permanent member uses the veto power outside the\r\nscope of Chapter VII of the Charter, the use of that veto\r\nshould be subject to the right of appeal by another\r\npermanent Council member to the General Assembly for\r\na final decision; the decision of the General Assembly on\r\nthe appeal should be on the basis of a two thirds majority\r\nvote.\r\nMy delegation supports the view that rationalization\r\nof the working methods and an increase in the\r\ntransparency of the work of the Council would enhance\r\nits effectiveness and efficiency, especially in terms of a\r\nsound working relationship with the other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, and a new constructive relationship\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly which\r\nshould include the effective flow of information and the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nexchange of views. We therefore support the proposals\r\nsubmitted by Argentina and New Zealand and set out in\r\ndocument A/50/47/Add.1.\r\nThe fact is undeniable that almost all United Nations\r\nMembers agree that the Council be reformed. Where we\r\ndisagree is on the scope of the reform. My delegation has\r\nconveyed specific proposals. My delegation believes that\r\nwith goodwill on the part of all, with a willingness to\r\ncompromise, and with political will, we should be able to\r\nreach a consensus on the scope of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council without undue delay.\r\nMr. Hamdoon (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, it gives me pleasure to express our sincere\r\nthanks to the Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and\r\nOther Matters Related to the Security Council. I wish also\r\nto thank the Vice-Chairmen for their excellent efforts in\r\nguiding the work of the Group last year. We are confident\r\nthat the skills and the experience of the current Chairman,\r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Razali Ismail, will qualitatively\r\ncontribute to the work of the Group.\r\nOver the past three years, discussions in the Working\r\nGroup have reflected a consensus on the importance of the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council and on the need for a\r\nreview of its working methods and procedures. With regard\r\nto expansion, my delegation wishes to reaffirm the joint\r\nposition of the Non-Aligned Movement: that the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council should be\r\ncomprehensive, reflecting the universal character of the\r\ninternational Organization, and that it is important\r\nsubstantially to increase the number of Council seats for the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, and for the developing countries\r\nof Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Any\r\nattempt to exclude the countries of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement from the process of expansion of the\r\nmembership would be totally unacceptable.\r\nAs for the issue of the reform of the working methods\r\nand procedures of the Security Council, we believe that this\r\nissue is increasingly important for all Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, because such reform would act as a safety\r\nvalve, ensuring that the Council responsibly carries out its\r\nduties under the Charter and preventing misuse of the\r\nCouncil’s powers by some of its members.\r\nRegrettably, however, we have noticed that in the\r\nWorking Group’s discussions last year there was an\r\nincreasing tendency to focus on the question of the\r\nenlargement and expansion of the Council at the expense\r\nof the issue of reforming its methods and procedures. We\r\nbelieve that the reform of procedures and working\r\nmethods was not given its due in the discussions of the\r\nWorking Group, where proposals for reform were\r\nrestricted to specific points, such as limitations on the\r\nveto and the question of lax interpretation and misuse of\r\nvarious Articles of the Charter, such as Articles 27, 31\r\nand 32.\r\nSuch proposals, although important, are not the only\r\nones that could enable us to overcome the deficiencies in\r\nthe working methods and procedures of the Security\r\nCouncil. It is true that the veto has been misinterpreted\r\nand misused, and it is true that Articles 27, 31 and 32 of\r\nthe Charter have not been translated into a working\r\nmethod of the Security Council in conformity with the\r\nspirit of the Charter.\r\nHowever there are other articles that have become\r\ninoperative, or have been misinterpreted — or have\r\nperhaps been used as a cover for practices that contravene\r\nthe purposes of the Charter.Article 41 has been used by\r\nsome members of the Security Council as if it were a\r\nblank cheque, a licence to impose comprehensive\r\nsanctions, as was the case with Iraq. Article 50 remains\r\ninoperative, despite the request by many countries to\r\nactivate it. Article 23 is ignored by some Member States,\r\nwhich act in the Security Council on the basis of the\r\nnarrow political views of their countries.\r\nA number of the articles in Chapter VI relating to\r\nthe pacific settlement of disputes remain inoperative\r\nbecause some members have an interest in jumping\r\ndirectly to action under Chapter VII. This was used as a\r\npretext to destroy vital facilities in Iraq and to drop\r\n120,000 tons of explosives.\r\nIf we pursue this line of thought, we reach a single\r\nconclusion: there is a need for a comprehensive approach\r\nto reforming all aspects of the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council and to overcoming ambiguities,\r\ngeneralities and subjective interpretations of the articles of\r\nthe Charter that establish the powers and the duties of the\r\nSecurity Council. Such interpretations have resulted in\r\ndouble standards in practices and criteria, and selectivity\r\nin application, which has harmed the credibility of the\r\nCouncil and of the United Nations.\r\nIn order to attain this comprehensive reform we\r\nshould give priority to the following objectives:\r\nprohibiting the use of the Security Council as a tool for\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nthe foreign policy of any particular State; confirming the\r\ninternational responsibility of the members of the Council;\r\nputting an end to the Security Council’s encroachment on\r\nthe prerogatives of the General Assembly and the other\r\norgans of the United Nations; restricting the use of the\r\nweapon of the veto in preparation for its elimination; and\r\ngiving Member States the right to question the Security\r\nCouncil with regard to its resolutions, either in the General\r\nAssembly or at the International Court of Justice, in order\r\nto ascertain their legitimacy and legality.\r\nFurthermore, States that are non-members of the\r\nCouncil should be informed of the lengthy deliberations that\r\nlead to serious resolutions, and those Member States should\r\nparticipate in the decisions, as outlined in the Charter.\r\nThere should be a further strengthening of the principle of\r\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability in the Security\r\nCouncil and its bodies. We should strengthen the Security\r\nCouncil’s commitment to the principles of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and the peaceful settlement of disputes and limit\r\nits resort to the mechanisms of Chapter VII. We should\r\nplace the mechanisms and procedures under Chapter VII\r\nunder strict control and affirm that there should be no resort\r\nto compulsory procedures unless they are justified. We\r\nshould prevent the Security Council from using such\r\nprocedures to starve peoples and to attack States.\r\nTo attain these objectives, we believe that the relevant\r\narticles of the Charter concerning the Security Council\r\nshould be reviewed, and that the duties and obligations of\r\nthe Security Council under Article 24 of the Charter —\r\nwhich states that the Security Council acts on behalf of the\r\nMembers of the United Nations in carrying out its duties —\r\nshould be precisely and clearly defined. Such work does not\r\nhave to start from square one; a number of valuable views\r\nand opinions have resulted from the work of the various\r\nUnited Nations working groups, such as the Informal Open-\r\nended Working Group of the General Assembly on An\r\nAgenda for Peace. Important views and proposals have\r\nbeen made by the subgroup on the question of United\r\nNations-imposed sanctions, under the chairmanship of His\r\nExcellency the Ambassador of Brazil. The Special\r\nCommittee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the\r\nStrengthening of the Role of the Organization has arrived\r\nat very useful conclusions during the past few years, as has\r\nthe Open-ended High-level Working Group on the\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations System.\r\nAll these and other important views and proposals\r\ncould prove a very useful and enriching contribution to the\r\nwork of the Working Group on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, and engender confidence in a review of the United\r\nNations Charter in accordance with Article 109. By taking\r\nsuch proposals into consideration, we would guarantee the\r\nsuccess of our efforts at comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Bergh (South Africa): Allow me at the outset\r\nto express my delegation’s deep satisfaction with and\r\nconfidence in the exemplary manner in which the two\r\nVice-Chairmen of the Open-ended Working Group,\r\nAmbassadors Breitenstein of Finland and Jayanama of\r\nThailand have, with great patience, guided our\r\ndeliberations in the Working Group.\r\nThe debate on this agenda item within the Open-\r\nended Working Group, created for the purpose of\r\nstudying methods of reforming the Security Council, has\r\nelicited a number of divergent views. It would appear,\r\njudging from some of the diametrically opposed positions\r\nadopted by certain delegations, that our painstakingly\r\nslow progress thus far on the various issues under\r\ndiscussion may be hampered even further if these\r\nmaximalist positions continue to be espoused.\r\nIt would seem that the diversity in the agenda of the\r\nWorking Group, ranging from the composition and size\r\nof an enlarged Security Council, its decision-making\r\nprocess and working methods to other matters related to\r\nthe Council, is perhaps a little too ambitious. This may\r\nwell be a contributing factor to the limited progress that\r\nhas been achieved to date.\r\nWhile we have proceeded on the basis that progress\r\non the various issues before us should proceed\r\nconcurrently, but that progress on certain issues should\r\nnot be impeded by the lack of progress in other areas, the\r\nreality of the matter is that this has not transpired in\r\npractice. This, we believe, is in part due to the positions\r\nthat some of the five permanent members have adopted\r\non matters under discussion other than the composition\r\nand size of the Security Council.\r\nWe are all aware that during our deliberations on the\r\nissue of decision-making in the Council during the past\r\nsession, the permanent five have remained steadfastly\r\nopposed to any proposal to curtail the use of the veto, one\r\nof them going as far as to state that it was not even\r\nprepared to submit the veto for negotiation or to put it to\r\na vote in any forum.\r\nOn the issue of the working methods, we heard\r\nproposals aimed at improving the transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s working methods, such as the very sensible\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nproposals relating to the broader interpretation of Articles\r\n31 and 32, in order that they should also apply to informal\r\nconsultations of the Security Council. Again we heard the\r\npermanent five argue that, since no formal decisions can be\r\ntaken during these discussions, Articles 31 and 32 are not\r\napplicable to these private gatherings.\r\nIn this manner, a legitimate appeal for greater\r\ntransparency in the working methods of the Council was\r\nconstrued by the permanent five as excessively harsh\r\ncriticism, thus resulting in a reaction that has all the\r\nmakings of over-protectiveness.\r\nSimilarly, suggestions for a periodic review of the\r\npermanent membership category of the Security Council\r\ndrew the reaction that this principle would amount to an\r\nindictment of failure against a permanent member. Yet this\r\nargument leaves much to be desired, and is certainly not\r\nconducive to attaining the ultimate aim of the exercise that\r\nwe are engaged in, which is specifically that of reforming\r\nthe Security Council, within the overall context of\r\nmodernizing the United Nations Organization.\r\nThis near stalemate on issues other than that of\r\nincreasing the membership of the Council has been reached\r\nin the face of overwhelming support for a review on these\r\nissues by the membership of the Organization.\r\nOur ambitious agenda can well be a challenge rather\r\nthan an obstacle if we as Member States display the\r\nnecessary flexibility. In this regard, certain permanent\r\nmembers have come out openly in support of a selective\r\nincrease in the size of the Council, yet they are holding the\r\nprocess in the Working Group to ransom by refusing to\r\nengage in a substantive discussion of the other issues\r\nrelating to Council reform. In the opinion of my delegation,\r\nthis approach of impeding progress on certain issues\r\ncontradicts the principle adopted by the Working Group\r\nrelating to the constructive discussion of the issues before\r\nit and will unnecessarily protract our debate.\r\nThe proposals relating to improving the transparency,\r\naccountability and legitimacy of the Security Council as\r\npreviously put forward by the African Group and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, as well as a number of innovative\r\nproposals submitted during our most recent session, deserve\r\nimmediate and thorough consideration.\r\nMy delegation wishes to call upon the permanent five\r\nto identify clearly those issues on which they are not\r\nprepared to enter into a substantive debate and to favour the\r\nWorking Group with reasons as to why this is the case. By\r\nthe same token, an indication by them as to the issues on\r\nwhich they are prepared to display flexibility would also\r\nbe helpful, in order that the modalities for future\r\nnegotiations can be established at an early stage as a way\r\nof speeding up and thus shortening our debate on these\r\naspects.\r\nOur discussions on the issue of size and composition\r\nof an enlarged Council during the last session were both\r\ndiverse and fruitful.\r\nOn this issue, my delegation believes that the\r\nprinciples governing the possible expansion of both\r\nmembership categories of the Security Council, as well as\r\nthe criteria for new membership, still require our further\r\nattention. While we have, thus far, reached consensus in\r\nthe Working Group that any expansion in the Security\r\nCouncil should ensure equitable geographical distribution,\r\ntaking into account the substantial increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations, especially of\r\ndeveloping countries, as well as important changes in\r\ninternational relations, we also need to admit that we have\r\na long way to go in our further definition of these broad\r\nterms of agreement.\r\nWe are all acutely aware of the fact that there were\r\nprevailing historical circumstances at the time which\r\ndeprived the authors of the Charter of the opportunity of\r\nlaying down criteria for permanent membership. However,\r\nwe are also aware that, in the event that there is\r\nagreement that this category of membership should be\r\nincreased, this is one distinct area where more intense\r\ndeliberation is needed, particularly when viewed in terms\r\nof the responsibilities which we as Member States assign\r\nto Security Council membership.\r\nSimilarly, changed global circumstances may\r\nnecessitate a revision regarding the criteria for new non-\r\npermanent members, this being a category where there\r\nalready appears to be a broad consensus that membership\r\nshould increase.\r\nMy delegation has followed with interest the\r\nintroduction in the debate of the various models involving\r\npermutations of membership in both categories, which\r\nalso attempt to take into account the issues relating to\r\nregional considerations, equitable geographical\r\ndistribution, the increase in the membership of the\r\ndeveloping countries, as well as important changes in\r\ninternational relations. We believe that a comprehensive\r\ndiscussion of the common denominators within these\r\nmodels, as well as those that may still be proposed during\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nthe present session, should be weighed within the context\r\nof the questions relating to the criteria and modalities for\r\nthe selection of new Security Council members.\r\nIn short, we believe that, bearing in mind that any\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council should\r\nnot impair the efficiency and effectiveness of its work,\r\nissues related to appropriate candidates, as well as those of\r\nspecific numbers, are of secondary importance to our debate\r\nat this stage. These should follow as the logical next step\r\nonce we have reached agreement on the overriding\r\nconcerns relating to criteria and modalities for the election\r\nof new members of the Security Council.\r\nWe cannot deny the fact that our deliberations on this\r\nagenda item have dragged on for too long. During his\r\naddress to the General Assembly at the beginning of this\r\nsession, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo registered South\r\nAfrica’s disappointment with the slow pace of progress in\r\nour debate on this subject. In this regard, my delegation\r\nwould support any initiatives aimed at setting time-frames\r\nwithin the debate for the finalization of the various issues,\r\nwithin the context of the overall set of Security Council\r\nreform issues as entrusted to the Working Group by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to assure you of my\r\ndelegation’s continued cooperation with regard to our\r\ndeliberations in the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nMr. Guillén (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nPeruvian delegation considers it essential to express its\r\nspecial gratitude to the co-Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador\r\nBreitenstein of Finland and Ambassador Jayanama of\r\nThailand, for their tireless efforts and their valuable\r\ncontributions to the progress of the Working Group.\r\nPeru will continue to participate responsibly,\r\nrealistically and flexibly in the negotiations of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil. It will assess each question on its own merits and\r\nplace the fundamental principles and spirit of the Charter\r\nabove the strategic and political interests of large and\r\nmedium-sized regional Powers. In spite of the natural\r\ncomplexity of the issues, progress has been made during the\r\ndeliberations: although the report has avoided making major\r\nformulations, there are important trends of opinion giving\r\nstructure to issues that we now want to see put up for\r\nnegotiation and decision.\r\nThe negotiations are complex because, unlike the\r\nreform of the Security Council in 1963, which was\r\ndecided upon after several years of negotiation, we are\r\nnow talking about an increase in the category of\r\npermanent membership, which has opened up discussion\r\non, inter alia, access to the special prerogatives of the\r\nfive permanent members.\r\nFirst of all, we believe that the strengthening of the\r\nSecurity Council does not mean just an increase in the\r\nnumber of its members. In our opinion, the Council will\r\nbe strengthened when its decisions are taken in strict\r\nconformity with the law and not subject to narrow\r\ninterests.\r\nWe also believe that reform needs to be\r\ncomprehensive because it must cover every constituent\r\naspect of the Security Council. This is intended not to\r\naffect its effectiveness but to strengthen its legitimacy.\r\nOn a number of occasions, we have expressed our\r\nposition on an increase in the permanent membership\r\nthrough the inclusion of two developed countries and\r\nthree developing countries, one from each of the three\r\nregions of the southern hemisphere. In accordance with\r\nArticle 23 of the Charter, they must all be able to\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of peace and security and\r\nat the same time, their incorporation into the Council\r\nmust respect equitable geographical distribution. Equally\r\nimportant, however, is the reference in that same Article\r\nto the contribution that these States must make to the\r\npurposes of the Charter.\r\nWe have maintained that contribution to the United\r\nNations does not mean just financial or military\r\ncontribution. Due regard must be paid to contributions to\r\ninternational political, economic and social agreements\r\nbecause these represent progress towards the objectives\r\nset out in the various Articles of the Charter. Along the\r\nsame lines, we also believe that having policies that are\r\nhistorically consistent with the Charter of the United\r\nNations is a fundamental qualification for any country\r\nthat aspires to be a permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nOne of the issues that the Working Group has to\r\nresolve is whether new members should be admitted on\r\na rotating basis. Another important proposal, the Italian\r\nproposal, tries to ensure an opportunity for all States to\r\njoin the Council. In principle, this would seem to meet\r\nthe largest number of legitimate aspirations. However, if\r\nwe were to choose the rotation alternative, we could be\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\nmoving away from the principle of consistency with the\r\nCharter and compliance with its provisions.\r\nWe also believe that an expansion of non-permanent\r\nmembership should preserve an equitable ratio in terms of\r\ndecision-making and that in order to preserve the\r\ndemocratic principle of access to non-permanent\r\nmembership in the Security Council, we would need to\r\nconsider the appropriateness of suspending the prohibition\r\nof immediate re-election contained in the Charter.\r\nThe Working Group’s report describes in considerable\r\ndetail decisions that have been taken or proposals made on\r\nthe Council’s working methods relating to transparency,\r\nwhich is seen as essential to the interests of non-members.\r\nIt is important to consolidate these measures so that they\r\nare not discretionary. It is important for some of them, such\r\nas consultations and briefings held with countries involved\r\nin matters dealt with by the Council, to be timely and\r\nprecede deliberations so that they can have an impact on\r\nthe decisions taken by the Council.\r\nBut above all, it is important to note that\r\nimprovements in the Council’s working methods must not\r\nresult in negotiations taking the place of the important\r\nsubstantive decisions that have to be taken on expanding\r\nthe membership of the Council and improving the decision-\r\nmaking machinery.\r\nThe non-use of the veto when one of the Powers was\r\ninvolved in a dispute was a cause that was fervently\r\ndefended by President Roosevelt in Dumbarton Oaks and\r\nSecretary of State Cordell Hull, and the proposal to admit\r\nthe veto only for procedural issues was supported by his\r\nsuccessor, Secretary of State Stettinius. Some years later, in\r\n1949, the General Assembly adopted resolution 267 (III)\r\nwhich recommended to the members of the Security\r\nCouncil that they consider a set of decisions related to it to\r\nbe of a procedural nature.\r\nAn extreme form of the veto demanded by the former\r\nSoviet Union, on which the Organization’s existence\r\ndepended towards the end of the San Francisco Conference,\r\nwas seen by Stalin as a banal matter. This, nonetheless, was\r\nwhat gave rise to the compromise formula that is reflected\r\nin the Charter. But this had to be adopted by vote: 20 in\r\nfavour, 10 against and 10 abstentions. For years, this has\r\nbeen a manifestation of compromise in the area of strategic\r\nsecurity.\r\nI have taken the liberty of making these references\r\nbecause the veto is present throughout the Charter, and as\r\nregards reform, as has been stated by the delegation of\r\nMexico, this is the major obstacle facing the Working\r\nGroup — even greater than the expectations for\r\nagreements that need to be taken by the countries of the\r\nthree regions of the southern hemisphere to participate as\r\npermanent members, an aspiration that almost all\r\nMembers agree should receive a positive response.\r\nIt is clear that the declining use of the veto in the\r\npost-cold-war period must reflect a reality. However, it\r\nhas not ensured the effectiveness of the Security Council\r\nin critical cases. Often, a sort of hidden veto has made\r\nconsensus possible only on ambiguous, diluted or\r\nreiterative texts. For this reason, it is important to\r\nreaffirm the authority of the Council and, of course, of\r\nthe Organization. It is also important to bear in mind that\r\nthe powers of the Council are rooted in the Charter and\r\ncannot be inconsistent with what is provided for therein;\r\nand in accordance with Article 24, paragraph 2, in\r\ndischarging its duties, the Security Council shall act in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations. This is an indication that the political decisions\r\nof the Council, which are a priority, are bound by\r\ninternational law as contained in the Charter.\r\nIn keeping with the spirit of realism with which we\r\nneed to consider the prerogative of the veto, the report\r\ncontains important proposals by countries or groups of\r\ncountries to make certain changes in this power, such as\r\nthe proposal made by Egypt, on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, and the one made by Brazil. We\r\nsupport these proposals and those calling for the double\r\nveto.\r\nThese are noteworthy references because the\r\nWorking Group was notified that the question of the veto\r\nwas not negotiable. This notification is significant because\r\nit implies that two developed countries that are explicitly\r\nsupported as permanent members by the five current\r\nPowers, and developing countries that aspire to this status,\r\nwould constitute a subordinate class of member States, in\r\naccordance with norms that could not be changed because\r\nof all the above-mentioned reasons.\r\nFinally, the brief reference contained in the report on\r\nthe important question of periodic reviews of the\r\ncomposition and membership of the Security Council\r\nshould be aimed at adapting the package of reforms to\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 1 November 1996\r\ninternational realities, but it should not be used to justify an\r\nagreement that is partial and incomplete in exchange for its\r\nregular review.\r\nThe Acting President: There are no more speakers in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 47.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to announce\r\nsome additions to the programme of work of the General\r\nA s s e m b l y w h i c h a p p e a r e d i n d o c u m e n t\r\nA/INF/51/3/Rev.l/Add.l. On Monday, 4 November, in the\r\nmorning, the Assembly will consider reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee on agenda items 129, 129 and 140 (a), 134 and\r\n157 following the consideration of agenda item 23, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee”.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
