IV)\r\nMr. Fowler (Ireland): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The following associated\r\ncountries align themselves with this statement: Bulgaria,\r\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,\r\nRomania and Slovenia. Iceland also aligns itself with this\r\nstatement.\r\nSix weeks ago the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole\r\nof the General Assembly completed the mid-term review of\r\nthe implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). The\r\nEuropean Union (EU) welcomed the opportunity offered\r\nby this review to focus international attention on the\r\nspecial situation and particular needs of Africa. We\r\npresented our views in a detailed statement to the review\r\nmeeting and through the submission of a position paper.\r\nThe EU availed itself of the occasion to reaffirm strongly\r\nour commitment, in a spirit of partnership and dialogue,\r\nto the development of Africa. We do so again today as\r\nthe Assembly gathers to endorse the outcome of the mid-\r\nterm review.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Committee assessed progress made to\r\ndate in the implementation of the New Agenda and\r\nagreed on recommendations for the next five years. The\r\nreview recognized that, while some encouraging progress\r\nhas been made in social and economic development, in\r\nincreasing democratization, in regional integration and in\r\nconflict prevention, management and resolution at the\r\nregional level, this progress has been uneven, and much\r\nremains to be done, as has been outlined, inter alia, in the\r\nreport of the Joint Inspection Unit (A/50/885).\r\nIn this context, the EU wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his recent\r\ninitiative in holding high-level consultations on post-\r\nconflict peace-building in West Africa.\r\nThe occasion of the mid-term review has allowed us\r\nto place UN-NADAF in the context of the related\r\ncommitments and plans of action of the recent series of\r\nmajor United Nations summits and conferences and to\r\ntake these commitments into account when making\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nrecommendations for future action. We reconfirmed the\r\nnew consensus on an integrated approach to\r\ndevelopment — an approach which places people at the\r\ncentre of our efforts to achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the action-oriented\r\nnature of the final document of the review meeting and the\r\nrecommendations on such issues as the strengthening of\r\ndemocratization and the involvement of civil society, good\r\ngovernance, social sector development, economic reform,\r\nenvironment and development, debt, trade and\r\ndiversification of economies, capacity-building and South-\r\nSouth cooperation.\r\nWe commend the commitments made at national level\r\nto the implementation of relevant recommendations through,\r\ninter alia, the effective mobilization and efficient utilization\r\nof domestic resources and through increased allocation of\r\nresources to the social sector.\r\nThe outcome of the review was the result of detailed\r\nnegotiations open to all States. All those who participated\r\nworked hard to achieve a consensus. The results of this\r\nreview should now be formally endorsed; we should avoid\r\nduplication of effort through reopening the consensus\r\nreached.\r\nThe support of the international community both at\r\nbilateral and multilateral level remains essential. Indeed,\r\nsince the review meeting, the international community has\r\nagreed to take action, through the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, on one of the most\r\nimportant issues addressed at the review. In addition, the\r\nParis Club has indicated that it is ready to go beyond the\r\nNaples terms to provide debt reduction of up to 80 per cent\r\nfor countries which qualify for additional relief within the\r\nHIPC Initiative, on a case-by-case basis, according to its\r\nusual rules, to achieve an exit from unsustainable debt.\r\nIn October this year we had an opportunity to\r\nstrengthen further our support for regional integration in\r\nAfrica when the Southern African Development Community\r\nand the European Union met at ministerial level in\r\nWindhoek, Namibia, and agreed to consolidate and increase\r\ncooperation in such areas as strengthening democracy,\r\ncombating illicit drug trafficking, clearance of landmines,\r\npromoting regional integration and promoting trade and\r\ninvestment with and within southern Africa.\r\nThe European Union remains fully committed to\r\nsupporting African countries in their efforts to achieve\r\nsustainable development. We take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to strive to reach, as soon as\r\npossible, the objective of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct to be devoted to official development assistance\r\nand to the related targets for assistance to the least\r\ndeveloped countries, a majority of which are in Africa.\r\nWe believe that this assistance should be directed to the\r\npoorest countries and to the poorest sections of societies.\r\nThe 20/20 initiative, whereby interested developed and\r\ndeveloping countries agree to allocate, respectively,\r\napproximately 20 per cent of official development\r\nassistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic\r\nsocial programmes, could also play a useful role.\r\nNeedless to say, the role of the United Nations\r\nsystem is central to a successful implementation of the\r\noutcome of the mid-term review. It is important that all\r\nconcerned support the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative for Africa as a way to implement the\r\nNew Agenda for Africa in a coordinated, system-wide\r\nmanner. We support the efforts of the various funds and\r\nprogrammes, together with the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nand other bodies of the United Nations system, to give\r\npriority to Africa and to the necessary readjustment of\r\nprogramming, as appropriate, in the light of the outcome\r\nof the mid-term review and the assessments of progress\r\nmade in the implementation of the summits and\r\nconferences.\r\nIn conclusion, the European Union fully endorses the\r\noutcome of the mid-term review of UN-NADAF. We are\r\ncommitted to supporting the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations, which we hope will lead to real\r\nprogress in fostering human and social capacity, in\r\nstrengthening economic performance and in protecting the\r\nenvironment, thus laying firm foundations for a better\r\nfuture for all African people.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Argentina is participating in this debate for\r\nthree basic reasons. The first reason is that we believe\r\nthat in doing so it is paying tribute to a very important\r\nsector of the United Nations, without whose substantial\r\ncontribution practically no change would have been\r\npossible in the General Assembly. Specifically, without\r\nthe initiative and support of African countries on\r\nquestions such as disarmament, human rights,\r\ndevelopment and the environment, to cite a few examples,\r\nthese issues would not have been aired or dealt with\r\nsuccessfully in our Organization.\r\nThe African Group, by its imposing numbers, has\r\nbeen the architect of the most important progress made in\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nthe United Nations. In close alliance with the Group of\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States and other regional\r\ngroups, it laid firm foundations for the effective\r\nconsideration of many of the conflicts that the United\r\nNations has witnessed and continues to witness.\r\nFor all these reasons, we think the time is now ripe for\r\nthe United Nations to begin to devise a way to return to the\r\nAfrican Group and to Africa some part of the great\r\ncontributions they have made to date. We particularly\r\nbelieve that we should promote all the initiatives that can\r\ncatalyse the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF). Those initiatives should provide structural\r\nopportunities for development and not merely try to\r\ncounteract the consequences of poverty.\r\nThe second reason why we are participating in this\r\ndebate is to support the report (A/51/228) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nAccordingly, to consider the thoughts put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General in the summary section of that document\r\nare very important. Priority problems are mentioned, such\r\nas good governance, the development of human resources\r\nand public savings: in sum, everything that falls under the\r\nheading of democracy and responsibility in African\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Secretary-General also mentions the need to settle\r\nthe disputes that afflict the countries of that continent. In\r\nthis connection, we believe that Africa has provided the\r\ninternational community with extremely valuable examples\r\napplicable to the settlement of current conflicts without\r\nviolence.\r\nWe must ask ourselves how it was possible for Africa\r\nto assimilate the legacy of decolonization and the problems\r\nof apartheid and territorial conflict — which by their very\r\nessence are very difficult to solve — and now, on the other\r\nhand, finds itself faced with violent and apparently\r\ninsoluble problems within its own communities. There\r\nappears to us to be an inconsistency between the problems\r\nAfrican countries, Governments and peoples overcame not\r\nlong ago and the African problems appearing today on the\r\npolitical agenda of the United Nations.\r\nSuccess in reforms, promotion of the private sector\r\nand direct foreign investment, increased activity in the\r\ndemocratic process and the strengthening of civilian society\r\nare essential elements of an Agenda for Development, and\r\nto a large extent depend on the support of the international\r\ncommunity, in terms of resources and political will. We\r\nwould therefore like to congratulate the Government of\r\nJapan for having convened a series of meetings to\r\nestablish the bases for defining the terms of international\r\ncooperation. We find it important — indeed, essential —\r\nin this debate to note the conclusions recently reached at\r\nthe high-level Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWe also attach importance to the activities\r\nannounced by the Group of 7 in Lyon, France, and to the\r\ndecisions adopted within the framework of the Bretton\r\nWoods financial institutions to relieve the external debt\r\nburden of African States.\r\nFinally, in the context of the upcoming World Trade\r\nOrganization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore,\r\nit is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the\r\ndeveloping world that the increased opening of markets\r\nunder way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine,\r\nfar-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still\r\nexist, thus ensuring access for the products of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe third reason why we are participating in this\r\ndebate is to initiate thinking on the potential for\r\ncooperation between Africa and Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean. In this connection, I believe that both regions\r\nhave a large degree of agreement on the major themes.\r\nOne of these, for example, is security. The signing of the\r\nTreaty of Pelindaba at Cairo, Egypt, last April is a new\r\ncontribution towards the final goal of fully eliminating\r\nnuclear weapons. There are many other points and many\r\nother issues on which there is agreement.\r\nWith regard to Argentina and Africa, some years ago\r\nwe set up a fund for horizontal cooperation. Some of its\r\nresources are oriented directly to Africa, and currently\r\nthere are over 70 projects under way. They include\r\nvarious activities, such as training for agricultural and\r\nlivestock work, pest eradication, cross-breeding and even\r\ncomputer science, State reform and privatization.\r\nAlong other lines, Argentina has been, is and will be\r\nparticipating in peacekeeping operations in Africa and in\r\nall humanitarian and medical assistance activities where\r\nit may be of assistance.\r\nFinally, I would like to clarify that all these\r\nproblems are universal. Latin America is not exempt from\r\nthem, nor is Argentina. This is why we are so sensitive to\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nthe problems of Africa and have such a strong sense of\r\nsolidarity with Africa.\r\nMr. Isakov (Russian Federation) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The Russian delegation on the whole takes a\r\npositive view of the report submitted by the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the\r\nMid-term Review of the Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\nl990s. In our view, this document objectively reflects the\r\nsituation at the half-way point in the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s (UN-NADAF), and contains a number of\r\nuseful and specific proposals and recommendations.\r\nSince the launch of UN-NADAF, a number of\r\ncountries on the African continent have made real progress\r\nin social and economic development, thanks to efforts at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. The number of\r\ncountries with negative growth rates has decreased\r\nsubstantially and, indeed, there has been marked increase in\r\nthe number of relatively successful countries in which\r\nannual rates of growth in gross national product have\r\nreached 6 per cent.\r\nThe monetary reforms carried out in many countries\r\non the continent, steps taken to strengthen financial\r\nmanagement structures, as well as measures to increase the\r\nefficiency and transparency of the tax system have all\r\ncontributed to the stabilization. Such steps, among others,\r\nrepresent additional incentives for potential investors.\r\nHowever, it is still too early to celebrate. Rather, it is\r\ntime to consider the fundamental causes of the persistently\r\ncritical economic situation that prevails on the continent,\r\nthe growing unemployment and the spread of poverty.\r\nLike many others, we are concerned that in the four\r\nyears since the initiation of UN-NADAF, the targets set for\r\nthe mobilization of financial resources have been only\r\npartially achieved. This relates to the volume of domestic\r\nsavings, the persistently high level of external debt, and the\r\nfall in official development assistance.\r\nWe have taken note of the report’s conclusion that in\r\na number of African countries there was an increase in\r\nforeign direct investment, the returns on which were much\r\nhigher than in other regions. There are prospects for an\r\nincrease in the flow of investments as economic reform is\r\nimplemented and as the investment climate improves. In\r\nthis context, a positive assessment should be given to the\r\nefforts made by numerous African countries to introduce\r\naccelerated procedures for the registration of investment\r\napplications — one-stop institutions — and to the\r\nexpansion of the establishment of export-processing zones\r\noffering special concessional packages of services for the\r\ngeneration of income in the production and trade sectors.\r\nWithout the settlement of the numerous conflicts in\r\nAfrica and the assurance of political stability, the African\r\ndevelopment strategy cannot be achieved. At the time we\r\nwelcomed the establishment by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) of a mechanism for conflict\r\nprevention and early resolution. Its work is designed to\r\nease the efforts of the international community in\r\npeacemaking and eliminating humanitarian crises, and\r\nthus to facilitate the mobilization of resources for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. Unfortunately, the planned\r\npotential of this mechanism has not yet been fully\r\nrealized.\r\nDestabilizing trends have assumed a particular\r\nsignificance today in connection with the events in the\r\nGreat Lakes region, which threaten a humanitarian crisis\r\nof unprecedented dimensions. The international\r\ncommunity must take urgent measures to prevent this and\r\nthen tackle the roots of instability in this region, including\r\nethnic tensions, poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nDevelopment is the pathway to stability. The planned 10-\r\nyear United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica is particularly important in this regard, as it\r\nprovides for the World Bank to play a coordinating role\r\nin the mobilization of the resources needed for its\r\nimplementation.\r\nRussia is making a contribution, to the extent\r\npossible, to the provision of humanitarian assistance in the\r\nAfrican continent. We not only provide aid during\r\nhumanitarian operations, but also give equipment and\r\nvehicles in response to the needs of the countries\r\nconcerned.\r\nMultilateral and bilateral cooperation in Africa is\r\ncharacterized by many overlapping and complementary\r\nprogrammes and operations. In this connection, we attach\r\ncrucial importance to the report’s emphasis on the need to\r\nprevent the dissipation of efforts. The best way to ensure\r\nthis, in our view, is to enhance the coordinating role of\r\nthe United Nations in providing assistance to Africa.\r\nAn important element for the successful development\r\nof the African economy is the strengthening of\r\ncoordination among the donor countries and the many\r\ninternational agencies to ensure teamwork in the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nimplementation — tailored to conditions in Africa — of the\r\nrecommendations of recent world forums on the theme of\r\nsocial and economic development.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): Whatever may be said about the critical\r\neconomic situation of African countries and the problems\r\nthey face, their causes and effects, there is no doubt that we\r\nall agree on their seriousness and the need to find the right\r\nsolutions to them in order to avoid consequences that could\r\njeopardize international peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa, adopted by the General Assembly in 1991, was\r\na good initiative aimed at giving the international\r\ncommunity the opportunity to review the deteriorating\r\neconomic and social conditions on the African continent\r\nwith a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to\r\nrenewing the commitment to support Africa’s efforts to\r\nachieve continued economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAll of us are aware that there are intrinsic reasons that\r\ncontributed to the aggravation of these problems and\r\nnegatively influenced Africa’s development plans. Foremost\r\namong them is the colonialism to which the countries of the\r\ncontinent were long subjected, during which their natural\r\nand human resources were drained and their markets cruelly\r\nmonopolized. Not only were Africa’s minerals and raw\r\nmaterials exported abroad, but Africans themselves were\r\nshipped across the Mediterranean and the Atlantic to\r\ncontribute to the economic and industrial development of\r\nEurope and the United States.\r\nWhen, after arduous struggles and many sacrifices,\r\nAfrican peoples finally obtained their political\r\nindependence, they found that they were the poorest\r\npeoples and that their continent was the poorest of\r\ncontinents. Africa has 33 of the world’s 48 least developed\r\ncountries. Yet the draining of Africa’s resources has\r\ncontinued in different forms, the worst of which has been\r\nthe continually low prices of its exported raw materials and\r\nthe continual rise in the prices of manufactured goods it\r\nimports. As a result, African countries have had to borrow\r\nmoney in order to achieve a measure of development to\r\nmitigate the poverty and deprivation suffered by their\r\npeoples. While most African countries are indebted, the\r\ntruth is that they have repaid their debts many time over\r\ngiven the exorbitant interest rates imposed on them, which\r\nhave increased Africa’s external debts to $US 322 billion\r\nin 1995.\r\nThe United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) has\r\nfocused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating\r\nprogress in agricultural development, food security,\r\nhuman resources development, rural and urban\r\ndevelopment, the establishment and maintenance of\r\ninfrastructures, the creation of the appropriate social\r\nenvironment, and the enhancement of regional economic\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe mid-term review of the implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda finds that the situation in the African\r\ncontinent is still essentially a cause for concern.\r\nPopulation growth rates in many countries outstrip growth\r\nin the gross domestic product, and this in turn has\r\nnegatively affected food security. Africa’s share of\r\ninternational trade is very small indeed, indicating that the\r\ncontinent is not fully integrated in the world economy.\r\nMost African countries suffer from a very severe shortage\r\nof the domestic resources needed for development,\r\nbecause of the accumulation of external debt, the\r\nreduction in official development assistance, and\r\nrestrictions on the transfer of technology and on access of\r\ntheir products to the markets of developed countries.\r\nOther contributory factors include civil wars and natural\r\ndisasters, leading to the spread of poverty and\r\nunemployment, and the growing problem of refugees in\r\nthe African continent, who now number more than 7\r\nmillion.\r\nAs regards its economic and social development\r\nAfrica has proved its sense of responsibility. Several\r\nAfrican countries have embarked on long-term political\r\nand economic reforms. Some of these countries have\r\nachieved growth rates of 6 per cent of gross domestic\r\nproduct. Others have started to formulate and implement\r\nstrategies for the eradication of poverty, as indicated in\r\nthe report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole for the\r\nMid-term Review of the Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s.\r\nHowever, progress so far has been slow and\r\ninsufficient. Rates of economic growth are still very low\r\nin many African countries; rates of trade growth are\r\ndeteriorating; the debt burden is accumulating; and\r\npoverty, unemployment and population growth are\r\nmarkedly on the rise. Endemic diseases are on the\r\nincrease. This proves that five years after its adoption\r\nUN-NADAF has not been given the expected support by\r\nthe international community. It is therefore incumbent\r\nupon donor countries, international financial institutions\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nand the United Nations system to create a favourable\r\nexternal environment to support national efforts in the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda — which was adopted\r\nby consensus. UN-NADAF requires the full support of the\r\ninternational community, which has morally committed\r\nitself to assist Africa economically and financially with a\r\nview to creating favourable conditions for an effective\r\nsustainable development that would compensate the peoples\r\nof Africa for all the hunger, disease, poverty, deprivation\r\nand ignorance they have suffered.\r\nWestern countries are in the debt of the African\r\npeoples, and they must shoulder their responsibilities.\r\nIndeed they will be the true beneficiaries of ending Africa’s\r\nbackwardness, because legal and illegal immigration from\r\nAfrica to Europe would cease and a favourable situation\r\nwould be created for reverse immigration of African talents\r\nfrom Europe to their own continent. This could result in an\r\neconomic, industrial and agricultural renaissance that would\r\nmake Africa a useful partner of Western countries through\r\nincreased trade between Africa, Europe and other\r\ncontinents.\r\nAlthough it is important to create favourable\r\nconditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African\r\ncountries, the owners of this capital should understand the\r\nneeds and the problems of African countries and should\r\nfocus on a number of priority questions, in particular the\r\ndevelopment of human resources conducive to a productive\r\nlabour force, which is essential for economic growth, and\r\nsupport for self-development in society, based on the\r\nconcept that human beings are the means and the ends of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nPeace is a precondition for development. The two\r\nconcepts are interrelated. In this context, my delegation\r\nnotes that coercive economic measures and sanctions, in all\r\ntheir manifestations, imposed by certain developed countries\r\nagainst some African countries, such as mine, with a view\r\nto exercising political and economic coercion against those\r\ncountries, in addition to the attempts by a big Power to\r\nimpose its laws beyond its own territory, all run counter to\r\nthe aims of development and peace. They violate the norms\r\nthat govern coexistence among States.\r\nDespite the coercive economic measures that have\r\nbeen imposed on my country for several years now, causing\r\ngreat hardship for its innocent people and obstructing its\r\ndevelopment plans in various sectors, my country does\r\neverything it can to support development in Africa, in the\r\nfirm belief that cooperation and interdependence among\r\nAfrican countries, especially in the economic field, is an\r\noption to which there is no alternative for the\r\nenhancement of development and progress in the African\r\ncontinent. My country has contributed to the\r\nimplementation of several economic and social projects in\r\nAfrica through the establishment of joint ventures and\r\njoint development banks in addition to giving several\r\nconcessionary loans and donations to help address the\r\nconsequences of natural disasters, desertification and\r\nepidemics. This is based on our belief in the importance\r\nof economic cooperation among African countries to\r\nenhance their capacity to achieve economic and social\r\ndevelopment. I wish to reaffirm that we will continue to\r\nmeet our commitments to the development of Africa\r\nbased on our unwavering policy towards the continent to\r\nwhich we belong, and based on our conviction that the\r\ncontinuation of the critical economic situation in Africa\r\ncould jeopardize international peace and security.\r\nWe call upon the international community to show\r\nits solidarity with Africa by supporting UN-NADAF,\r\nwhich is the basis for cooperation among African\r\ncountries, donor countries and international financial\r\ninstitutions based on the principle of shared responsibility,\r\nstrengthening partnership and abandoning the policy of\r\nindifference and marginalization to which the continent is\r\ncurrently subjected. The support we call for is\r\nnecessitated by humanitarian and ethical considerations\r\ntowards a continent which has long suffered from\r\ncolonialism, plunder, deprivation, backwardness,\r\nmarginalization and exploitation.\r\nIn this context, I would like to recall the address by\r\nPresident Museveni of Uganda during the General\r\nAssembly commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations, in which he stated that:\r\n“Africa will develop whether or not Europe forgets\r\nAfrica ... [Our] development does not depend on\r\nEurope’s remembering us ... [It] is crucial that we in\r\nAfrica solve these bottleneck problems and ... the\r\nfactors within Africa that have stopped us from\r\ndeveloping. The exogenous factors, those from\r\noutside Africa, are only secondary ...\r\n“Does that mean that Europe should not help\r\nus? No, Europe should help us. First, the Europeans\r\nowe us debts. They caused us many problems. They\r\ncame and plundered our economies. They used our\r\neconomies to build themselves up so it is a moral\r\nrequirement that Europe should help us if only to\r\npay for past mistakes.” (Official Records of the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, 37th plenary\r\nmeeting, p. 2)\r\nMrs. Albright (United States of America): I am\r\npleased to address the General Assembly concerning\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s.\r\nWe are at the midpoint — halfway between the\r\nlaunching of the New Agenda five years ago and its end\r\npoint early in the next century. More broadly, we are in the\r\nmidst of a great historic transition, as cold-war divisions\r\nfade and the new realities of our own era are more clearly\r\ndefined.\r\nEarlier this year, I travelled to Africa, visiting Liberia,\r\nAngola, Rwanda and Burundi — all countries about which\r\nthe United Nations has been deeply concerned. This visit\r\nreinforced for me the belief that in this new era the peoples\r\nof the world have many important interests in common. The\r\nNew Agenda for development in Africa is one of them.\r\nClearly, taken as a whole, Africa remains deeply\r\ntroubled. It faces daunting problems, including civil strife,\r\na large foreign debt, increasing populations dependent on\r\ndecreasing amounts of usable land, and an inadequate flow\r\nof investment.\r\nOur shared goal, reflected in the New Agenda, is to\r\nbring down these and other barriers to growth, working\r\nboth at the national and international levels, not overnight,\r\nbut over a period of time during which steady progress is\r\nmade. We work together towards this end because we know\r\nthat an Africa that is progressively more free, stable,\r\nproductive and prosperous will benefit every segment of the\r\nworld community. It will promote sustainable development\r\nat the national level aimed at alleviating poverty, combating\r\nhunger and disease, providing education and jobs, and\r\nending the discrimination that afflicts many people on the\r\ncontinent, holding them back from realizing their full\r\nhuman potential.\r\nIt will enhance the climate of cooperation that has led\r\nrecently to the extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the approval of a\r\nban on nuclear tests. It will make it easier for African\r\nnations to fight back against the transnational networks of\r\ncrime, narcotics and terror that imperil every continent. It\r\nwill help Africa to preserve its rich bounty of natural\r\nresources and thereby add to the health and sustainability of\r\nour global environment. It will lend further momentum to\r\nthe trend towards more open economic and political\r\nsystems that is the defining characteristic of this decade.\r\nAnd it will contribute, through expanded commerce and\r\na more efficient use of resources, to a rising standard of\r\nliving not only for the people of Africa, but for all\r\npeople.\r\nOver the past decade, guided by a process of\r\nongoing dialogue and by conference deliberations in Rio\r\nde Janeiro, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and\r\nIstanbul, the world has narrowed past disagreements and\r\nmoved closer to consensus on issues related to human\r\ndevelopment. It is from this basis of common ground that\r\nwe now review the New Agenda for the development of\r\nAfrica.\r\nAs the mid-term review indicates, we have come to\r\nunderstand that economic development, social\r\ndevelopment, environmental protection and conservation\r\nare mutually reinforcing. They are each elements of\r\nsustainable development, and they each add to our quality\r\nof life.\r\nWe know also that the primary impetus for\r\neconomic growth in Africa, as elsewhere, must come\r\nfrom the private sector. It is encouraging, therefore, that\r\nmany Governments in Africa are facilitating growth by\r\ncreating monetary, regulatory and legal policies that allow\r\nlegitimate private enterprises to take hold. They are also\r\nmaking choices that maximize available resources through\r\ninvestments in education and health, and that expand\r\naccess for women to the levers of economic and political\r\npower. As a result, the economic outlook in Africa is\r\nimproving. After three years of decline, the continent\r\nexperienced real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of\r\n1.9 per cent in 1994 and 3.2 per cent in 1995. Real per\r\ncapita growth was positive last year, for the first time in\r\nsix years.\r\nThese gains would not have been possible without a\r\ncommitment by many African Governments to economic\r\nand political reform. If Africa is to move forward, that\r\ntrend must continue and broaden.\r\nMomentum towards democracy in Africa must also\r\ncontinue. People on every continent have learned that\r\ndemocracy is a parent to development. That is because\r\ndevelopment depends on people, and people who are free\r\nto exchange ideas, publish their thoughts, organize their\r\nlabour and invest their capital will contribute far more to\r\na society than those shackled by repression.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nSince 1989, more than 20 African nations have\r\nembraced democratic government, including South Africa,\r\nwhose peaceful transition from apartheid to multi-party\r\ndemocracy is one of the landmarks of this century.\r\nCertainly, we must agree with former President Soglo of\r\nBenin that, when it comes to democracy, Africa cannot\r\nafford to be held to a lesser standard than other regions.\r\nIn the same manner, the world must do all it can to\r\nhelp Governments and non-governmental organizations\r\nwithin the region to strengthen civil society. By so doing,\r\nwe enhance the rule of law, protect human rights and create\r\nthe kind of stability in which local entrepreneurs can thrive\r\nand outside investors can have confidence.\r\nFinally, we have established common ground about the\r\nneed to cooperate to end the conflicts that still plague\r\nAfrica, retarding development and causing immense human\r\nsuffering. Here again Africans must play the lead role. No\r\noutside force, even if regionally based, can impose peace\r\non those who do not desire peace.\r\nMy Government has pledged to help interested African\r\nStates to increase their capacity for responding to conflicts\r\nthrough an African crisis response force.\r\nWe are supporting strongly the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping mission in Angola. We are seeking a\r\nworldwide agreement to end the scourge of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, which have been especially devastating to\r\nAfricans. And we are lending strong diplomatic support to\r\ninitiatives originating in the region that aim at preventing\r\nfurther bloodshed in trouble spots such as Burundi and\r\nLiberia.\r\nWe know that in Africa, as elsewhere, one of the great\r\nchallenges we face is controlling ethnic hate and curbing\r\nextreme nationalism. Despite the current problems in\r\nCentral Africa, Africans generally have much to teach the\r\nworld about the peaceful resolution of ethnic differences.\r\nTogether, we must get across the principle — the truth —\r\nthat what matters most everywhere is not the distinctions\r\nthat divide us, but the common humanity that binds us. And\r\nwe must find practical means to help those working to\r\nbring peace and achieve reconciliation in places now\r\nthreatened or racked by conflict.\r\nToday, five years after it was launched, the New\r\nAgenda for the development of Africa retains its\r\nsignificance. The world must work together to help Africa\r\nrealize its full potential. Although this effort cannot succeed\r\nwithout wise and forward-looking African leaders, neither\r\ncan the many leaders who merit that description succeed\r\nwithout the partnership of international institutions and\r\noverseas friends.\r\nAccordingly, my Government continues to support\r\nthe New Agenda; we endorse the mid-term report and its\r\nrecommendations; and we will continue to participate\r\nactively and cooperatively in its implementation.\r\nWe also support the Special Initiative for Africa\r\nannounced this spring as a means for implementing the\r\nNew Agenda.\r\nWe will strive, with others, to enhance food security\r\nin Africa and to see that commitments made at this\r\nmonth’s World Food Summit are kept. We will work\r\ntowards the integration of Africa into the world’s\r\neconomy, and, where we can, will help deserving\r\ncountries to meet the rules and requirements of the World\r\nTrade Organization.\r\nOfficial development assistance, both bilateral and\r\nthrough the operational activities of the United Nations,\r\nand multilateral lending will continue to be essential to\r\nsupport national efforts by African countries. They are\r\nmost effective when they supplement and promote private\r\nsector participation and leverage private capital flows.\r\nReform of these United Nations funds and programmes\r\ncan ensure greater efficiency, delivering more resources\r\non the ground to finance development.\r\nFinally, we will continue to participate in efforts to\r\nease the debt burdens borne by the world’s poorest\r\ncountries, especially those whose Governments are\r\ncommitted to policies of economic and political reform.\r\nTo this end, the United States has forgiven more than\r\n$1.2 billion in debt owed by 19 countries. We also joined\r\nin approving the recent World Bank and International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) agreement to provide enhanced\r\ndebt relief for the most heavily indebted poor countries.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nToday the greatest divide in the world is not\r\nbetween East and West or North and South or left and\r\nright. It is between those trapped by the grievances and\r\npreconceptions of the past, and those who have the vision\r\nand courage to shape the future.\r\nAs we prepare for the twenty-first century, we know\r\nthat the key to the future of Africa is not donor-led\r\ndevelopment, as some have insisted in the past, but rather\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\ndevelopment, based on the rule of law and full respect for\r\nhuman rights, that is led by the private sector and guided\r\nby a new generation of forward-looking African leaders\r\nworking in partnership with international institutions, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and Governments around the\r\nworld.\r\nTogether, let us pledge that, five years from now,\r\nwhen we look back in this body upon the completion of the\r\nNew Agenda, we will each be able to say that we did our\r\npart to end conflict, strengthen democracy, promote reform,\r\nand create opportunity for all the people of Africa and by\r\nso doing, to help people everywhere live richer, freer and\r\nmore rewarding lives.\r\nMr. Muhammed (Ethiopia): Allow me at the outset\r\nto convey the congratulations of my delegation to His\r\nExcellency Ambassador Hisashi Owada, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Japan, His Excellency Ambassador Denis\r\nDangue Rewaka, Permanent Representative of the Republic\r\nof Gabon, and His Excellency Ambassador Samuel\r\nInsanally, Permanent Representative of the Republic of\r\nGuyana for their contributions to the successful conclusion\r\nof the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the Mid-term Review of the\r\nImplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, which took place last\r\nSeptember at United Nations Headquarters.\r\nThe outcome of the review process demonstrated how\r\nmuch African Governments and the international\r\ncommunity need to strengthen their partnership to put the\r\nAfrican continent on a sustainable path of social and\r\neconomic development. The review places a formidable\r\nchallenge before us, as partners in the development of\r\nAfrica. My delegation therefore takes this opportunity to\r\ncall for a renewed and fresh commitment by the\r\ninternational community to the accelerated implementation\r\nof the programme of action envisaged in UN-NADAF for\r\nthe rest of the decade. The specific areas of concern that\r\nshould be addressed as a matter of priority both by African\r\ncountries and by the international community have been\r\nvery well defined in the review exercise. It is with that\r\nunderstanding and trust that my delegation would like to\r\nhighlight certain aspects of the mid-term review.\r\nThe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s was a political compact between the\r\nAfrican countries and the international community, aimed\r\nat fostering the economic and social progress of Africa\r\nthrough transformation, integration and diversification. It\r\nfurther aims at reducing the vulnerability of the African\r\neconomy to external shocks and at internalizing a self-\r\nreliant process of development. An average actual growth\r\nrate of 6 per cent per annum for gross national product\r\nwas also set as a target. However, the review outcome\r\nexplicitly demonstrated that much more remains to be\r\ndone in the future to achieve the objectives of UN-\r\nNADAF.\r\nIn an effort to benefit from the increasingly\r\nglobalized and liberalized world economy, African\r\ncountries have undertaken major structural adjustment and\r\nwide-ranging economic reforms within agreed structural\r\nand sectoral frameworks. They have also been taking\r\nparallel measures to strengthen democratic reforms.\r\nNotwithstanding the commitment of many African\r\ncountries to securing peace and macroeconomic stability,\r\nsometimes at great political risk and with tremendous\r\nsocial hardship, the gains of reform fall short of\r\nexpectations. African countries continue to be\r\nmarginalized and have not been effectively integrated into\r\nthe world economy. Poverty has grown in magnitude and\r\nseverity. Except for modest recovery and growth in a few\r\nAfrican countries, the per capita income growth of the\r\nmajority is far below the target set in UN-NADAF.\r\nThese deteriorating trends stem in part from a steady\r\ndecline in international support and cooperation. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance is at the lowest level in 20 years.\r\nOfficial development assistance is now only 0.25 per cent\r\nof the combined gross national product of all countries\r\nmembers of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development as compared to the 0.7 per cent target\r\nset at the United Nations in 1970; that has taken a heavy\r\ntoll, particularly on African development.\r\nThe aggregate net resource flow to Africa — official\r\ndevelopment assistance and other — amounted to only\r\n$31 billion in 1995, of which $26.4 billion was official\r\ndevelopment assistance. That shows vividly how Africa\r\ndepends primarily on a single source of resource transfer,\r\nwhich, unfortunately, has shown a considerable decline in\r\nrecent years. It is therefore essential to maintain an\r\nincreased and consistent level of official development\r\nassistance of improved quality and quantity. The donor\r\ncommunity has to respect and fulfil its commitment by\r\nachieving the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross national product, including the agreed menu of\r\naid targets and commitments, as set out in paragraph 23\r\nof the Programme of Action for the least developed\r\ncountries for the 1990s.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nLikewise, the African countries together received only\r\nabout 2 per cent of global capital flows, despite their best\r\nendeavours to attract private investment through painful\r\nstructural adjustment programmes and liberalization of their\r\neconomies. Recent economic analyses attribute these very\r\nlow levels of investment flows to Africa to the\r\naccumulation of such factors as poor infrastructure, poor\r\ntelecommunication systems and the lack of utilities. It is\r\nclear, therefore, that the prevailing weak physical, social\r\nand institutional infrastructure in Africa needs to be\r\nimproved to bring about a significant shift in the direction\r\nof foreign investment. African countries need financial,\r\ntechnical and other support from the international\r\ncommunity, not only for the execution of their social\r\nprogrammes, but also for the development of their\r\ninfrastructures that help improve the investment\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe new international trading system is one of the\r\nareas in which the marginalization of Africa has become\r\nglaringly evident. Unless the current unfavourable\r\ninternational trading pattern changes to accommodate the\r\ncommodity and other trade interests of Africa, meaningful\r\ndevelopment efforts are not imaginable. For the\r\nenhancement of African participation in international trade,\r\naccess to the markets of the developed world is crucial.\r\nUrgent actions aimed at diversifying African commodities\r\nand removing tariff and non-tariff barriers need to be taken\r\nto strengthen the competitiveness of African countries in\r\nworld trade.\r\nThe debt problem is still with us, and remains a\r\nformidable challenge to African economic recovery and\r\ndevelopment. The debt-servicing obligation of Africa drains\r\na significant amount of scarce resources that could\r\notherwise be used for economic and social development.\r\nAlthough the international community has striven to\r\nalleviate the debt burden of Africa through various debt-\r\nrelief measures, including the Toronto and Naples terms, to\r\ndate, none of them has been in a position to render durable\r\nsolutions to the problem.\r\nEven the most recent debt initiative announced by the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund to\r\nalleviate the debt burden of the heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries, although it seems commendable, is not only\r\ninsufficient but limited in scope. In addition, its eligibility\r\ncriteria and conditionality are a source of concern.\r\nTherefore, without a new comprehensive debt strategy that\r\ngoes beyond existing mechanisms, the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF could be in jeopardy. We wish to reiterate the\r\noft-repeated call for a once-and-for-all development-\r\noriented approach that goes beyond the Naples terms and\r\nincludes, among other measures, debt cancellation and\r\ndebt-for-development exchanges.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\noccupy a special place in ensuring coordinated follow-up\r\nin the monitoring of the implementation of UN-NADAF.\r\nThe leading role of galvanizing the required synergy\r\nwithin the United Nations system must be given utmost\r\npriority. In this regard, the Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica, which is a regional arm of the United Nations\r\nsystem, must be equipped with the necessary resources\r\nand logistic support to discharge its responsibility in the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF in cooperation with other\r\nentities of the United Nations system.\r\nIt is also imperative for the United Nations to\r\ncoordinate with the Organization of African Unity, which\r\nplayed a leading role in the elaboration and\r\nimplementation of the Abuja Treaty and the Cairo Agenda\r\nfor Action to relaunch Africa’s economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize again the\r\nnecessity of galvanizing the political and economic\r\ncommitment of the international community to provide\r\nconcrete, full support to such a noble programme as\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nMr. Fowler (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nIn adopting the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa (UN-NADAF) in 1991, this\r\nAssembly posed a crucial challenge to Africa and the\r\nentire international community. Canada’s support for the\r\nNew Agenda, and our active participation in the review\r\nprocess, can be explained by one simple consideration:\r\nour enduring commitment to Africa. This commitment is\r\nreflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we\r\nhave with African Governments both at the bilateral level\r\nand through a range of multilateral agencies, and which\r\ntake the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian\r\nnon-governmental organizations throughout the continent,\r\nand growing number of partnerships in the private sector.\r\nAs the report of September’s mid-term review\r\nmeeting underlines — and African Governments rightly\r\ninsist on this — the primary responsibility for African\r\ndevelopment rests with Africa. United Nations agencies,\r\npartner countries such as Canada, and international\r\nbusiness and non-governmental organizations have a role\r\nto play, but it is necessarily a complementary one. They\r\ncan do no more — and must do no less — than support\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nthe leadership of African Governments and citizens in\r\nshaping their own development.\r\nLeadership and the spirit of initiative in African\r\ncountries have produced many positive developments in\r\nrecent years. In his report the Secretary-General observed\r\nthat there has been significant improvement in public\r\nadministration in Africa in recent years. There has been a\r\nnew pragmatism and competence in economic management,\r\na renewed commitment to making poverty reduction a top\r\npriority of social policy, and remarkable progress in\r\npolitical liberalization, including a greater place for civil\r\nsociety in social and economic policy, as well as\r\nGovernment accountability. Such good news seldom makes\r\nheadlines — however, it should.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe Secretary-General has also observed — and this\r\ncannot be overstated — that civil conflict continues to have\r\na major impact on development in Africa. Recent conflicts\r\nhave entailed tragic human costs; but they also entail\r\nmassive costs in terms of the political attention and\r\nresources that must be devoted to them by the international\r\ncommunity. This reinforces the need to continue our efforts\r\nto strengthen United Nations conflict prevention and\r\nconflict resolution capabilities. The Secretary-General has\r\nshown leadership in this regard with his appointment of a\r\nSpecial Envoy to the Great Lakes region. He has, of course,\r\nCanada’s full support in this undertaking.\r\nTo surmount internal and external conflicts, there is no\r\nsubstitute for home-grown political will. The Organization\r\nof African Unity Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution is an important step in this\r\ndirection, which Canada has welcomed and has supported\r\nfinancially. In a similar vein, at the recent Ottawa\r\nConference on anti-personnel landmines, several African\r\ncountries made key contributions, including an African\r\nregional component to the agreed Plan of Action. It is\r\nhoped that a treaty totally banning landmines can be signed\r\nby the end of 1997. Until the millions of landmines are\r\nremoved, in particular from rural agricultural land in\r\nAngola and Mozambique, economic and social development\r\nin those countries will be sorely hampered.\r\nDevelopment assistance remains an important factor in\r\nAfrica’s economic development. For its part, Canada\r\nallocates 44 per cent of its bilateral aid to Africa. But this\r\nis only one element of the solution. As the September mid-\r\nterm review states, efforts to promote the private sector and\r\nforeign direct investment must be accelerated. This can best\r\nbe achieved when there is an open, transparent domestic\r\nsystem in place, and when the private sector and civil\r\nsociety are fully engaged in the process. Canada thus\r\nencourages such activities as the International Finance\r\nCorporation’s Extending the Reach programme. And we\r\nare increasingly witnessing significant direct investment\r\nby Canadian companies in numerous African countries.\r\nOne result of the mid-term review should be a\r\nfurther streamlining of the United Nations system’s\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF. The cause of African\r\ndevelopment will not be served through a proliferation of\r\nparallel or competing implementation strategies. The\r\nUnited Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa\r\nshould thus be approached as a complement to\r\nUN-NADAF, strengthening the implementation of its\r\nprogramme elements.\r\nWe are especially pleased to observe that the United\r\nNations and the international financial institutions have\r\nbeen working together more effectively. We trust this\r\ncooperation will deepen, enhancing the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF. Canada welcomes the comprehensive debt\r\nrelief initiative for heavily indebted poor countries agreed\r\nto at the recent annual meetings of the World Bank and\r\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF). Heavily indebted\r\npoor countries, many of which are in Africa, will now be\r\nreturned to debt sustainability within a reasonable time-\r\nframe. Canada was also pleased to participate in the\r\nseventh African Development Fund replenishment\r\nnegotiations in May and to contribute to the additional\r\nspecial subscription in June.\r\nTo conclude, this mid-term review has demonstrated\r\nthe continuing validity and urgency of the objectives set\r\nfive years ago by the New Agenda for Development in\r\nAfrica. And the conclusions of the Ad Hoc Committee’s\r\nSeptember meeting afford a sound basis for pursuing\r\nthose objectives with renewed focus in the years ahead.\r\nCanada pledges its continued support for this enterprise\r\nand stands ready to work in partnership — with the\r\ncountries of Africa, regional institutions and the United\r\nNations — in addressing the crucial challenges of\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana): My delegation wishes to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the reports that have been\r\nmade available for the consideration of this agenda item,\r\nboth during the mid-term review session and in this\r\nAssembly. We wish to place on record our gratitude to\r\nthe members of the Bureau of the mid-term review\r\nsession held from 16 to 20 September 1996. In particular,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nwe would like to thank Ambassador Hisashi Owada of\r\nJapan for ably steering the review session. We appreciate\r\nthe untiring efforts of the Government of Japan to seek\r\nsolutions to Africa’s development problems.\r\nThe mid-term review of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF) was intended to assess the implementation\r\nof the Agenda, to identify obstacles to its prompt\r\nimplementation, and to recommend ways of ensuring\r\neffective implementation of its remaining portions. The\r\nreview session noted that in accordance with the\r\ncommitments made under UN-NADAF, African countries\r\nhad undertaken various political and economic reforms\r\nwhich had contributed to the achievement of economic\r\ngrowth over the past few years. It was further observed that\r\nthe international community, including the United Nations\r\nsystem, had provided African countries with some support.\r\nNevertheless, the implementation of the Agenda had faced\r\nserious obstacles, which had prevented the achievement of\r\nset targets. Among other things, African countries had\r\nexperienced considerable difficulties in attracting the\r\nrequisite foreign direct investment, and had also been\r\nunable to ensure adequate access of their populations to\r\neducation, health and related social services.\r\nRegarding resource mobilization, the review showed\r\nthat net disbursements of official development assistance\r\nhad decreased from about $24 billion in 1991 to $21.9\r\nbillion in 1994, before increasing to $26.4 billion in 1995,\r\nwhereas UN-NADAF had projected a minimum of $30\r\nbillion in 1992. The total external debt of Africa also rose\r\nfrom $300 billion in 1991 to about $322 billion in 1995,\r\nwhile Africa’s share of world countries’ trade declined from\r\n3.1 per cent in 1990 to 2.1 per cent in 1995.\r\nImplementation of the Agenda was further hampered by\r\nshortcomings at the advocacy and institutional levels as a\r\nresult of lack of clear mandates and insufficient resources.\r\nIt is the hope of my delegation that the obstacles\r\nmentioned above will be removed and efforts made by all\r\nparties to ensure full and timely implementation of the\r\nAgenda. African countries will continue, among other\r\nthings, to pursue the necessary programmes to deepen\r\nongoing reforms, engage in more aggressive investment\r\npromotion activities, ensure democratization, and strengthen\r\nhuman resources and capacities for sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhile acknowledging that the primary responsibility\r\nfor the implementation of the Agenda lies at the national\r\nlevel, we call on the international community to provide the\r\nnecessary financial resources in accordance with its\r\ncommitments under the Agenda. These include the\r\nprovision of official development assistance at an annual\r\nrate of $30 billion, to be increased by 4 per cent per\r\nannum; the adoption of an effective international debt\r\nstrategy to address the unsustainable debt of Africa;\r\nsupport for the development of trade infrastructures; the\r\nremoval of trade barriers; and support for commodity\r\ndiversification efforts and regional cooperation. In\r\ntranslating the recommendations of the review session\r\ninto action, my delegation wishes to stress the need to be\r\nguided by time-frames for specific targets, bearing in\r\nmind that the Agenda has only five more years to run.\r\nIt will be most unfortunate for this august Assembly\r\nto convene in five years’ time at the end of the\r\nimplementation period, only to acknowledge again that\r\nimplementation of the Agenda has been behind schedule.\r\nTo avoid such a situation, and to ensure timely\r\nimplementation, we wish to recommend that the\r\nSecretary-General provide to this Assembly an annual\r\nreport on the state of implementation of the Agenda,\r\nindicating specific action that has been taken by all\r\nparties to achieve set targets. This recommendation\r\nimplies the inclusion on an annual basis for the next five\r\nyears of an agenda item on this subject. We believe that\r\nregular assessment of the implementation of the Agenda\r\nwill also enable us to determine whether we are on track,\r\nand assist us in speeding up where implementation is\r\ndelayed.\r\nFinally, my delegation expresses the hope that the\r\nrelevant United Nations bodies responsible for follow-up\r\nwill be provided with the requisite resources to enable\r\nthem to undertake their function of improving follow-up\r\nand monitoring the implementation of the Agenda.\r\nMr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): Only a few weeks\r\nago, the international community carried out the mid-term\r\nreview of the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF). In this connection, I wish to pay tribute to\r\nAmbassador Owada of Japan, who so ably chaired the\r\nreview proceedings, as well as to the entire Bureau of the\r\nAd Hoc Committee for the Mid-term Review. Five years\r\nafter the launching of the New Agenda, the review gave\r\nus an opportunity to take fresh stock of the distance we\r\nhave travelled together and assess what was needed to\r\nachieve the objectives we set for ourselves. We therefore\r\nwelcome this opportunity to exchange views on this\r\nsubject of critical importance to the African people.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nIn recognition of the fact that we, the African people,\r\nbear the primary responsibility for our own development,\r\nwe have undertaken various measures to restructure and\r\nliberalize our economies at enormous social and political\r\ncost. A lot has also been achieved in terms of promoting\r\nfreedom, social justice, peace and security. The reports\r\npresented during the mid-term review exercise bore clear\r\ntestimony to the fact that the African countries have largely\r\nfulfilled their part of the compact. These ambitious and\r\npainful reforms will certainly founder if our development\r\npartners fail to augment our sterling efforts.\r\nAs I observed in my statement during the mid-term\r\nreview, in many parts of Africa the dawn of an\r\nunprecedented era of peace and tranquillity has allowed us\r\nto refocus attention and deploy scarce resources towards\r\neconomic development. However, these peaceful conditions\r\ncannot be fully secured without the requisite undergirding\r\nof economic development. Development is a sine qua non\r\nfor international peace and security. We believe that the\r\neconomic situation in Africa is at a critical juncture and\r\ncalls for decisive intervention by the international\r\ncommunity. An economically vibrant and prosperous Africa\r\nis an asset to the world economy. It enhances the\r\npossibilities for a peaceful and secure human existence\r\nbecause poverty, deprivation and want are fertile ground for\r\npolitical instability and social decay. As the international\r\ncommunity hatches and launches one ineffective initiative\r\nafter another, that dark cloud hovering over much of Africa\r\nthreatens to drag us back into the abyss of political\r\ninstability and even deeper political ruin. The question that\r\nthis Assembly should ask itself is whether we need to wait\r\nuntil catastrophes manifest themselves in unsightly and\r\ngruesome television images in our living rooms.\r\nThe mid-term review of UN-NADAF demonstrated\r\nthat not much had been done to attain the specific targets\r\nthat we had collectively set for ourselves. We call on our\r\ndevelopment partners to honour their obligations if we are\r\nto rescue the New Agenda from the disastrous failure that\r\nit appears to be headed towards. UN-NADAF stands the\r\nvery real risk of experiencing the fate that befell its\r\npredecessor, the United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development\r\n(UN-PAAERD).\r\nWhile we concede that official development assistance\r\nis a crucial part of overall development assistance to Africa,\r\nwe also remain firm in our conviction that it cannot and\r\nshould not continue to be the decisive factor that it\r\ncurrently is in our development strategy. We prefer a\r\ngenuine partnership in trade and not the surrogate role of\r\nrecipients of aid. And so we are asking how we can\r\nprosper if our few exports are denied market access by\r\nthe high wall of protectionist barriers in developed\r\ncountries. In order for the African countries fully to\r\nbenefit from the new multilateral trade regime and the\r\nincreasingly integrated global economy, the developed\r\ncountries should abandon their protectionist policies. The\r\nsad truth is that while the benefits to African countries\r\nfrom the new multilateral trade regime are far from being\r\nassured, what we are certain about is that, in the short and\r\nmedium term, African countries will suffer substantial\r\nlosses. The international community should take urgent\r\nmeasures to alleviate the adverse impact of this trend.\r\nEqual competition among grossly unequal partners is\r\nunfair competition. There is need for affirmative action on\r\nbehalf of Africa, the weakest link in the emerging global\r\npartnership.\r\nWe think it is disingenuous for our development\r\npartners to insist that African countries meet all their debt\r\nobligations to the penny when these payments are\r\ngobbling up all our export earnings. We believe that there\r\nis a clear and direct relationship between Africa’s\r\nunsustainable debt burden and the flight from the region\r\nof financial resources necessary for economic recovery,\r\ngrowth and development. Many African countries are\r\nhaving to squeeze their people to the point of malnutrition\r\nor starvation to meet their debt obligations. Given this\r\nunsustainable debt burden, it is good economic sense to\r\ngive us the opportunity to retain the larger part of our\r\nexport earnings for reinvestment in our economies.\r\nAt the mid-term review, we dwelt at considerable\r\nlength on the mobilization of domestic and international\r\nresources for development. What we find curious is that\r\nthe outcome of the review process fails to acknowledge\r\nthe fact that, for most African countries, there is actually\r\na net outflow of resources. In view of the capital flight,\r\nwe should again ask a rhetorical question: How are we\r\nexpected to develop if we cannot reinvest our meagre\r\nexport earnings? We need to arrest and reverse the capital\r\nflight that has hamstrung and undermined our efforts to\r\nsave and to reinvest in our economies. We believe that\r\ngenuine development is that which is born of and spurred\r\nby our own entrepreneurship, creative potential, and by\r\nthe genius and industry of our own people. But, as I have\r\nalready said, we Africans are getting dwindling volumes\r\nof aid and losing all of it through debt servicing.\r\nDevelopment, as described by the Foreign Minister\r\nof Zimbabwe in his address before the Assembly in\r\nSeptember 1996, is meaningless if it fails to bring food to\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nour dining tables, clean water into our homes, better\r\nhousing, improved health and peace of mind and security\r\nto our children. It is not about statistics. No volume of\r\nwords, resolutions, conferences or programmes of action\r\ncan in themselves bring the reality of economic\r\ndevelopment to Africa. What we need are not empty\r\nprotestations of solidarity but international development\r\ncooperation that transcends the realm of fruitless discourse\r\nand manifests itself in concrete terms through discernible\r\nimprovements in the lives of ordinary men, women and\r\nchildren.\r\nFinally, I wish to conclude by drawing the attention of\r\nthe participants to an evaluation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for Africa that was conducted by the United\r\nNations Joint Inspection Unit. There are also comments on\r\nthat report by the Secretary-General and the Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination.\r\nMr. Yacoubou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is with great pleasure that I address the General\r\nAssembly for the first time to express Benin’s position on\r\nitem 44 of our agenda, entitled “Implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s”. The delegation of Benin fully associates\r\nitself with the statement made on behalf of the African\r\ncountries by the Ambassador of Cameroon and with some\r\nof the views expressed by the representatives who spoke\r\nearlier on this item, whose importance and relevance are\r\nself-evident.\r\nFrom 16 to 20 September last, the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nof the Whole of the General Assembly established by\r\nresolution 50/160 A, proceeded to the mid-term review of\r\nthe implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF)\r\nunder the chairmanship of Ambassador Owada of Japan and\r\nwith the assistance of the other members of the Bureau,\r\nnamely the ambassadors of Belgium, the Czech Republic,\r\nGabon and Guyana. I should like, on behalf of my\r\nGovernment and in my personal capacity, to congratulate\r\nthem on the quality of their work and for their dedication\r\nto championing the causes and the interests of Africa.\r\nOn 18 December 1991, after the adoption of\r\nUN-NADAF by resolution 46/151, the late Ambassador of\r\nNorway, Martin Huslid — and here I pay tribute to his\r\nmemory — stated that in subscribing to the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda on the Development of Africa in the 1990s,\r\n“the international community accepts the principles of\r\nshared responsibility and full partnership with Africa”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\r\nsixth Session, Plenary Meetings, 77th meeting, p. 18-\r\n20)\r\nand that it committed itself to giving full and tangible\r\nsupport to the African efforts.\r\nIt should be recognized, in one way or another, that\r\nthe adoption of the New Agenda was accompanied by a\r\nheightened awareness, on the political level, of the special\r\nsituation and particular needs of Africa. These priority\r\nitems for the international community are addressed in the\r\ndeclarations and programmes of action of the major\r\nsummits and conferences organized by the United\r\nNations, in international legal instruments concerning the\r\nenvironment and in the relevant resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe have no doubt that the next World Food\r\nSummit, to be held from 13 to 17 November 1996 in\r\nRome, will emphasize the same concerns.\r\nFurthermore, at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, Heads of State and Government stated in\r\nCommitment 7 of the Copenhagen Declaration:\r\n“We commit ourselves to accelerating the economic,\r\nsocial and human resource development of Africa\r\nand the least developed countries.” (A/CONF.166/9,\r\np. 21)\r\nEverything leads us to believe that the solemn\r\ncommitment undertaken by the General Assembly in\r\nDecember 1991 and confirmed by the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in March 1995 is of pivotal political\r\nimportance. Moreover, the Secretary-General has often\r\nemphasized and recalled that, in accordance with the\r\nprogramme adopted by joint agreement, Africa is one of\r\nthe five priorities of the United Nations in the 1990s.\r\nThis is one of the basic reasons for the launching in\r\nMarch 1996 of the Special Initiative of the United\r\nNations on Africa, which is designed to promote and to\r\nstep up the attainment of the objectives set out by the\r\nGeneral Assembly within the framework of UN-NADAF.\r\nWe note with regret at the mid-term review that,\r\ndespite this promising political backdrop and the clear\r\nwill of the African countries to extricate themselves from\r\nunderdevelopment, UN-NADAF has experienced only an\r\nembryonic implementation — or at the very least a\r\nfragmentary one. In other words, very few actions or\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nspecific steps have followed the litany of declarations,\r\nspeeches and promises made since the start of this decade.\r\nAttempts by African delegations to secure the adoption\r\nby consensus of a resolution calling for the establishment\r\nof a diversification fund for African commodities within the\r\nframework of the implementation of the UN-NADAF\r\nchapter dealing with support for the diversification of\r\nAfrican economies have encountered a dogged, unjustified\r\nand somewhat contemptuous refusal on the part of certain\r\ndelegations of members of the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development.\r\nThe delegation of Benin would like to hope that the\r\nnext five years of the implementation of UN-NADAF will\r\nbe successful insofar as the mid-term review has allowed us\r\nto reaffirm and to emphasize the reciprocal nature of\r\ncommitments and responsibilities, and the need for Africa\r\nand the international community urgently to take concrete\r\nmeasures such as those put forward in resolution 46/151\r\n(1991) and reiterated by the mid-term review. It is thus\r\nclear that a great deal remains to be done to achieve at least\r\nthe priority objectives of UN-NADAF, including the\r\neffective and total integration of Africa into the world\r\neconomy.\r\nThe mid-term review took place in the context of the\r\nglobalization of the economy and of the liberalization of\r\ntrade, which presents opportunities and challenges as well\r\nas risks and uncertainty. The risk of further marginalization\r\nfor Africa is today a real one. This is more than ever the\r\ntime to make a concerted effort on the global level to\r\nestablish an international atmosphere favourable to the\r\nintegration of Africa and of the least developed countries in\r\ngeneral into the world economy. The establishment of such\r\nan atmosphere requires, inter alia, necessary measures to\r\ncancel public or bilateral debt; to substantially reduce\r\nmultilateral debt — which for many African countries has\r\nquadrupled within a decade; and to reschedule, if not\r\nreduce or wipe out, commercial debt. There is a need to\r\nfind effective, favourable and lasting solutions to the\r\nexternal debt problem of African countries.\r\nThere is a need to redirect the objectives of policies\r\nand programmes of structural adjustment towards social\r\ndevelopment, in particular the elimination of poverty, the\r\ncreation of productive jobs and the strengthening of social\r\nintegration.\r\nThere is a need to achieve the objective of 0.7 per\r\ncent of developed countries’ gross national products for\r\nofficial development assistance for developing countries,\r\nwith 0.15 to 0.20 per cent to be devoted to the least\r\ndeveloped countries, of which 33 out of 48 are African\r\ncountries. There is a need to implement effectively and in\r\na timely manner the commitments undertaken by the\r\ninternational community with regard to the specific needs\r\nand problems of Africa.\r\nIt is clear that these measures must be complemented\r\nby considerable efforts on the part of African countries.\r\nI should like here to refer to the need firmly to root and\r\nconsolidate the process of democratization, which\r\nfortunately today covers the entire African continent. This\r\nwill allow for greater awareness regarding respect for and\r\nadvancement of human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nand for a greater concern for good public administration\r\nin a spirit of transparency, justice, credibility, equality and\r\nequity.\r\nBenin began its democratic process after the historic\r\nconference of the vital forces of the nation in February\r\n1990, well before the 1991 adoption of UN-NADAF. Our\r\nmove forward to consolidate our new democratic\r\nexperience has turned out to be entirely consistent with\r\nthe objectives of UN-NADAF. The Government of Benin\r\nkeenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and\r\nsupport of the entire international community, the United\r\nNations system, multilateral financial institutions, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and all the other elements of\r\ncivil society throughout the world in order to conclude\r\nsuccessfully its programme of building a State truly based\r\non the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all\r\nthe citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of\r\nwell-being.\r\nWe are aware that the mere satisfaction of the ritual\r\ndemands of electoral consultations, the implementation of\r\nthe principle of orderly change of government, the\r\nestablishment and respect for democratic institutions and\r\nchecks and balances provided by our Constitution will not\r\nsuffice to consolidate and guarantee democracy once and\r\nfor all in Benin and in other African countries.\r\nI would be remiss if I were to conclude my\r\nstatement without highlighting the quality of the work\r\ncarried out by the Office of the Special Coordinator for\r\nAfrica and the Least Developed Countries, for the\r\nadvancement, implementation and follow-up of the\r\nobjectives, measures, activities and recommendations of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s. In the light of the positive\r\nconclusions of the mid-term review, my delegation would\r\nlike to appeal for the strengthening of that Office with the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nhuman, financial and material resources required to pursue\r\nits mandate.\r\nIndeed, the sudden disappearance of the division for\r\nleast developed countries, landlocked countries and small\r\nisland developing States from the secretariat of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development after its\r\nninth session, held at Midrand, South Africa, continues to\r\nbe a cause of serious concern for us. The Office of the\r\nSpecial Coordinator for Africa and the Least Developed\r\nCountries is now the sole entity of the Secretariat which is\r\nin charge of the advancement, implementation and follow-\r\nup of UN-NADAF on the international level. We hope that\r\nreforms now under way will contribute to the greater\r\nvisibility of the Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa\r\nand the Least Developed Countries.\r\nFinally, like numerous preceding speakers, I would\r\nlike to hail the initiatives, activities and projects undertaken\r\nby the United Nations system for the development of\r\nAfrica, as well as the activities and actions undertaken by\r\nall of Africa’s development partners, including the non-\r\ngovernmental actors which have made the economic\r\nrecovery and development of Africa one of their priorities.\r\nThus, I would like to appeal to all States that the\r\nresults of the mid-term review of the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF be scrupulously applied to achieve the\r\neffective elimination of poverty, the diversification of our\r\neconomies, the growth of direct foreign investment and a\r\nspeeding up of the process of Africa’s genuine integration\r\ninto the system of liberalization of international trade and\r\nin the globalization of the economy.\r\nMr. Abibi (Congo) (interpretation from French): The\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s (UN-NADAF), which the General Assembly\r\nadopted unanimously on 18 December 1991 on the basis of\r\nthe principles of shared responsibility and full association\r\nwith Africa in the attainment of its objectives, constitutes\r\nan important political manifestation of the international\r\ncommunity’s solidarity with Africa.\r\nAt this point in my statement, I would like to associate\r\nmyself with the well-deserved tribute paid to Ambassador\r\nOwada of Japan, as well as to the Bureau of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole, for the masterful manner in which\r\nthey conducted the mid-term review.\r\nThe mid-term review of the implementation of this\r\nimportant political pact highlights not only the great\r\nsacrifices made by the African countries in introducing both\r\nstructural and institutional reforms and the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to support economic recovery\r\nand social development in Africa, but also the long road\r\nthat remains to be travelled to attain the main objectives\r\nof the programme.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Congo considers\r\nthat the praiseworthy results already achieved should not\r\nconceal the many obstacles that remain to be overcome to\r\nattain true, lasting development in Africa. The essential\r\ngoals of the New Agenda are far from being achieved.\r\nDespite glimmers of hope here and there on the continent,\r\nthe economies of the African countries remain very\r\nvulnerable to external fluctuations. The development\r\nprocess is far from being endogenous. For the most part,\r\nas the excellent report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the\r\nWhole of the General Assembly emphasizes, many of the\r\neconomic and social problems that led to the adoption of\r\nthe United Nations Programme of Action for African\r\nEconomic Recovery and Development on 1 June 1986\r\nand the New Agenda in 1991 remain acute. The\r\nmobilization of the necessary resources remains below the\r\nlevels forecasted. The debt burden still saps many\r\neconomic initiatives.\r\nThe mid-term review is occurring in an international\r\ncontext characterized by the globalization and\r\nliberalization of the world economy, which presents\r\nAfrica with both new opportunities and new challenges.\r\nThe review should provide an opportunity for Africa and\r\nthe international community not only to reaffirm their\r\ncommitments of five years ago but also to adopt the\r\nnecessary measures to accelerate the implementation of\r\nthis important political contract.\r\nAmong the needs worthy of sustained attention on\r\nthe part of Africa and its partners is the creation of a\r\npeaceful environment both within and among States.\r\nPeace is indeed a prerequisite for development. Because\r\nof the political instability and destruction it engenders, the\r\npersistence of armed conflict, civil war and ethnic\r\nrivalries is damaging to development efforts. In this\r\nregard, the delegation of the Republic of Congo supports\r\nthe recommendation in the Ad Hoc Committee’s report\r\nthat the international community should continue to\r\nsupport subregional and regional initiatives to settle\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s notes that Africa’s\r\neconomic and social development is primarily the\r\nresponsibility of Africans. In an international environment\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\ncharacterized by the exacerbation of commercial, financial\r\nand cultural competition, in which international aid is\r\nbecoming scarcer, strengthening the endogenous capacities\r\nof Africa is a healthy imperative to allow our continent to\r\ntake its destiny into its own hands. The acquisition and\r\nmastery of the key resources of science and technology are\r\ncrucial in this regard. The international community must\r\nresolutely pursue its efforts to help African countries make\r\ndecisive progress in these areas.\r\nThe risks of marginalization of African countries\r\nremain a reality in an international context marked by a\r\ntendency to create broad blocks or large free-trade zones.\r\nRegional or subregional integration, by enabling Africa\r\nfully to exploit the complementary nature of its immense\r\nwealth, is an essential condition for its development. It is\r\nalso a decisive factor for the peace and stability of the\r\ncontinent. Micro-nationalism, rural exodus, movements of\r\npopulations or population explosions, even ethnic tensions\r\nand civil wars, forcefully emphasize the necessity for\r\ndynamic regional and subregional cooperation. We therefore\r\nwelcome all recommendations aimed at consolidating\r\ninitiatives that have been taken in this direction by African\r\ncountries.\r\nWhatever the reforms undertaken or the sacrifices\r\nmade by Africa, all the goals of the New Agenda cannot be\r\nquickly achieved without sustained and significant support\r\nfrom the international community.\r\nAfrica has demonstrated that it stands ready to fulfil\r\nits part of the contract. It would like the international\r\ncommunity to continue to play its role vigorously, so that\r\ntogether, in solidarity, we can find lasting solutions to the\r\nexpectations of thousands and thousands of human beings\r\nstruggling with hunger, poverty and natural catastrophes on\r\nthe continent. As the moralist tells us, it is somewhat\r\nshameful to be happy in the midst of certain sufferings.\r\nMr. Bune (Fiji): There is no doubt whatsoever that\r\nAfrica has been a grossly neglected continent. Its neglect by\r\nthe international community in one way or another spawned\r\na string of negative elements which have caused the\r\nstagnation of the growth and development of the countries\r\nof Africa, individually and collectively. Yet, Africa is a\r\ncontinent blessed with a plethora of natural resources.\r\nThe full economic and social utilization of those\r\nresources for the benefit of the peoples, to uplift them and\r\ncreate and maintain a better way of life, has been retarded\r\nby the severe impact of external debt and, concomitantly,\r\ndebt-servicing costs, declining levels of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, reduced financial flows for\r\ninvestment and for industrial, business and commercial\r\ndevelopment, increasing barriers to trade and impaired\r\naccess to the markets of the developed countries of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe situation which the African continent has faced\r\nand faces is not unique to Africa alone. It is a tragedy\r\nfaced by other regions and countries of the world,\r\nincluding my own region, the South Pacific.\r\nIn the case of my own country, for example, official\r\ndevelopment assistance from traditional and regional\r\ndonors has declined and conditions are being imposed on\r\nthe reduced aid levels. Trade balances with regional\r\nmetropolitan centres weigh heavily in their favour, and\r\nyet hindrances are placed in the way of our access to their\r\nmarkets. Capital inflows for industrial, business and\r\ncommercial development have declined.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the positive\r\ndevelopments which have taken place on the continent\r\nover the past five years under the New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). The\r\nmid-term review mentions that since the implementation\r\nof the New Agenda, political, economic, structural and\r\ninstitutional reforms have been implemented in many\r\ncountries. Closer regional and subregional economic\r\ncooperation has been established. The continent has seen\r\nincreased democratization and the assumption at the\r\nregional and subregional levels of the role and\r\nresponsibilities of leadership in conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution. A number of African\r\ncountries are beginning to formulate and implement\r\nstrategies and policies aimed at the eradication of poverty.\r\nOn the other hand, my delegation notes with great\r\nconcern that after five years, much of the Agenda has yet\r\nto be accomplished. Also of great concern is whether all\r\nof it can be fully accomplished in the next five years. The\r\nmid-term review states that many of the critical social and\r\neconomic problems which led to the adoption of the New\r\nAgenda still exist and, in some countries, have even\r\nworsened. Poverty and unemployment are expected to\r\nincrease substantially. The estimated resource mobilization\r\nlevels in the New Agenda are still far from being\r\nattained, and the key development goals have yet to be\r\nmet.\r\nThe conclusion is obvious: the New Agenda has had\r\na poor record of implementation. Accelerated progress in\r\nthe implementation of the New Agenda over the next five\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nyears is clearly needed. My delegation joins in the call of\r\nthe African countries to the international community,\r\nparticularly the developed countries of the world, and to\r\ninternational organizations, to honour their commitments\r\nmade under the Agenda.\r\nIt seems palpable to my delegation that the United\r\nNations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa is\r\nintended to bridge the gap that exists in the implementation\r\nof the Agenda by coordinating the efforts between the\r\ninternational community, the Bretton Woods financial\r\ninstitutions and the United Nations on the issues of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe call upon the United Nations to exert every effort\r\nunder the Initiative to ensure the full implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the coming\r\nfive years. In the words of the Administrator of the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the commitment to\r\ndevelopment must continue to be emphasized as the central\r\nobjective of the work of the United Nations. The United\r\nNations must reflect and embody the highest priority of\r\nmost peoples and most nations; that priority today is\r\ndevelopment — sustainable, people-centred development.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): It is my great privilege to\r\naddress the Assembly on behalf of the delegation of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland on the agenda item entitled\r\n“Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s” (UN-NADAF). We\r\ncommend the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for its comprehensive report on the\r\nstatus of the implementation of UN-NADAF, contained in\r\ndocument A/51/48.\r\nWith its unique approach, the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was\r\naimed at renewing the commitment of African countries\r\nand the international community to an agenda for the\r\nsustainable social and economic development of Africa in\r\na spirit of global partnership based on shared\r\nresponsibilities. The New Agenda sets out key targets to be\r\nachieved by the year 2001, and specifies a number of\r\nresponsibilities and commitments for their achievement, to\r\nbe discharged in a spirit of partnership between Africa and\r\nthe international community. In this regard, the report of\r\nthe Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General\r\nAssembly has afforded us the opportunity to evaluate how\r\nmuch has actually been achieved to date.\r\nStark facts in the report reveal the distance both\r\npartners have to travel towards meeting the desired results\r\nby the year 2001. The mid-term review of the United\r\nNations New Agenda took place against the background\r\nof fundamental developments in international economic\r\nrelations. While globalization and liberalization\r\nphenomena pose opportunities and challenges for the rest\r\nof the world, for Africa the fear of further\r\nmarginalization, at least in the short term, is a reality.\r\nCoping with these challenges and living up to\r\ncommitments in the various programmes of action is\r\nbeyond our present means. Unfortunately, all this happens\r\nto coincide with an atmosphere of aid fatigue and severe\r\nbudgetary pressures in the developed countries, with\r\nquestions about the efficacy of international development\r\ncooperation, and with protectionist pressures seeking to\r\nundermine the theory of comparative advantage under the\r\ncloak of social and environmental causes.\r\nAfrican countries and the international community\r\nhave taken a number of actions to achieve the objectives\r\nof UN-NADAF. The most remarkable efforts have come\r\nfrom African Governments which have undertaken major\r\npolitical and economic reforms. Democratization and good\r\ngovernance have been institutionalized in many African\r\ncountries. The commitment of African Governments to\r\npolitical and economic reforms was further highlighted at\r\nthe Seventeenth Extraordinary Session of the Council of\r\nMinisters of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in\r\nMarch 1995, which adopted a declaration on relaunching\r\nAfrica’s economic and social development: the Cairo\r\nAgenda for Action.\r\nFor its part, the Government of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland commissioned a National Economic Review in\r\n1994-1995, in which the private sector and community-\r\nbased civic societies were among the major participants.\r\nThis exercise was designed to identify areas likely to\r\ngenerate economic growth. Alongside our National\r\nEconomic Review Commission is the Constitutional\r\nReview Commission, which was set up in July 1996 to\r\nreview the Constitution of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nAfrica’s responsibility and commitment in the\r\nimplementation of the programmes of UN-NADAF also\r\ninclude regional economic cooperation and integration, the\r\ncreation of a climate conducive to attracting foreign\r\ninvestment, adopting people-centred development,\r\nprotecting the environment, pursuing strategies aimed at\r\nachieving food security and the eradication of poverty,\r\ndisease and illiteracy in the continent.\r\nThe international community, for its part, committed\r\nitself to assisting Africa in the provision of adequate\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nresource flows for development and investment,\r\ndiversification of primary commodities, and support for\r\nregional economic integration.\r\nHowever, it is clear today that we are already far\r\nbehind schedule in the realization of our goal.\r\nThe impact of these actions on overall African long-\r\nterm development has been very minimal.\r\nIf we agree that long-term, sustained growth and\r\nsustainable development depend on the private sector and\r\non attracting foreign direct investment, then we must\r\nidentify a true incentive for investment, since Africa,\r\ndespite its conducive climate, is still unable to attract\r\nforeign direct investment.\r\nFor most countries, the downward trend of recession\r\nhas been arrested. Some have experienced a modest\r\neconomic recovery. The New Agenda had estimated that\r\n$30 billion in official development assistance would be\r\nneeded in 1992, and that this sum would need to grow by\r\n4 per cent annually in order to sustain a gross national\r\nproduct (GNP) growth rate of 6 per cent per annum for\r\nsub-Saharan African countries. To date, official\r\ndevelopment assistance has been insufficient to jump-start,\r\nlet alone sustain, African economic growth.\r\nWe therefore appeal to the developed countries to\r\nfulfil, as soon as possible, their commitment to attain the\r\naccepted United Nations targets of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational for official development assistance, as stated in\r\nparagraph 60 of the report.\r\nAfrica’s debt problem undermines any effort to\r\nimprove our economic growth. It requires concrete and\r\nurgent measures to bring the burden to a manageable level.\r\nIt is our view that, unless bold and innovative measures are\r\ntaken by the multilateral institutions to reduce the debt, the\r\nnegative economic situation will persist.\r\nThe delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland believes\r\nthat, in order to achieve meaningful and positive results for\r\nAfrica by the year 2001, the political will that led to the\r\nadoption of UN-NADAF must be backed by the necessary\r\nmeans, in implementation of the recommendations of the\r\nreport of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the Mid-term Review of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s.\r\nThe continent of Africa is facing an economic war.\r\nLet our partners overseas recall that, during the Second\r\nWorld War, they recruited its sons to fight a war in\r\nEurope. That was done in a clear spirit of partnership.\r\nSome of us could have been born earlier, but, due to the\r\nSecond World War, our birth was delayed because our\r\nforefathers were fighting a war overseas. Now is the time\r\nfor those countries we were assisting overseas to come to\r\nAfrica and join in fighting the war that is facing the\r\ncontinent. Our war is simple, because it kills no men.\r\nThose who come to assist us will return home alive. We\r\nask our partners to come and support us in order to fight\r\nand win the economic war that is besetting the continent\r\nof Africa.\r\nMr. Suamin (Indonesia): Let me begin by extending\r\nour appreciation to His Excellency Ambassador Hisashi\r\nOwada of Japan for the helpful remarks he made in\r\npresenting his report as the Chairman of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the\r\nMid-term Review of the Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF). We fully agree with him that\r\nthe development of Africa is one of the major challenges\r\nin this post-cold-war era and that the economic take-off\r\nof Africa would not only improve the standard of living\r\nof its people, but would also have a positive impact on\r\nthe world economy as a whole.\r\nOn that basis, I believe that we should approach the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF in the second half of this\r\ndecade bearing in mind the recommendations adopted at\r\nthe mid-term review. In this context, I should like to say\r\nthat the efforts of the African countries in implementing\r\nthe Agenda over the past few years are highly\r\ncommendable and should inspire the international\r\ncommunity to greatly enhance its support for promoting\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nYet despite the untiring efforts of the African\r\ncountries, the Agenda has fallen short of expectations. A\r\ngreat deal remains to be done by the international\r\ncommunity. Shortcomings still abound and must be\r\nvigorously addressed if the implementation process of the\r\nNew Agenda is to be revitalized and reinvigorated.\r\nOur task at this session of the Assembly is to forge\r\nan agreement that the recommendations of the mid-term\r\nreview be integrated into the Agenda for implementation\r\nin the second half of the decade. Since the points and\r\nrecommendations of the report have already been well\r\ncovered by the various delegations, especially by the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nAfrican countries themselves and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), I will confine myself to a few issues\r\nthat my delegation considers important.\r\nWe note that the mid-term review of the New Agenda\r\nlast September recommended an increased focus and\r\nconcerted action to further enhance the implementation of\r\nthe Agenda. However, in the present context, the African\r\ncountries are faced with a perilous situation in which,\r\nunless the international community effectively and\r\nconcretely addresses several core and global development\r\nissues, the prospects for the future are likely to be quite\r\ndim, and expectations may very well come to naught.\r\nLet me therefore briefly focus on some of the areas in\r\nwhich we firmly believe that the international community\r\nshould critically enhance its support for African\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFirst, the financial resources committed to in the\r\nAgenda have fallen far short of expectations. Given the\r\nunique difficulties of some African countries, including\r\ntheir lack of access to private development funds, it is\r\nimperative that new efforts be made so as to effectively\r\nreach the targets of the Agenda. Since, by default, official\r\ndevelopment assistance is the dominant source of financial\r\nsupport for Africa, the international community should seek\r\nto fulfil its commitment to attain the accepted United\r\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product\r\n(GNP), including the targets of the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s.\r\nInvestment in Africa should also be fostered by supporting\r\nsuch areas as venture capital initiatives, institution-building\r\nand human resource development. In addition, given the\r\npersistent stagnation and even decline of some countries,\r\nthere is a strong case for increasing the concessionary\r\ncomponents and level of development assistance to Africa.\r\nAnother area that persistently undermines development\r\nefforts in Africa and requires attention is the continuing\r\nexcessive debt situation. Standing at $322 billion in 1995\r\nand representing 38.3 per cent of export earnings in 1994,\r\nthe external debt overhang represents a tremendous drain on\r\nresources that would otherwise have been available for\r\ndevelopment purposes through domestic savings and\r\nexternal financial flows for development. Both the Naples\r\nterms agreed by the Paris Club and the recent initiative by\r\nthe international financial institutions servicing multilateral\r\ndebt are definitely steps in the right direction. It is\r\nimportant, as called for in the Ad Hoc Committee’s report,\r\nthat these efforts be continued. Also critical is that we\r\nrecognize that piecemeal approaches alone cannot\r\neffectively redress the issue. There is an urgent need to\r\nemploy a comprehensive approach so that the necessary\r\ncritical mass to enable the African countries to resume\r\ndevelopment on a sustained and sustainable basis can be\r\nreached. Without such a “once-and-for-all” strategy in\r\nplace, the debt problem cannot be decisively resolved.\r\nInternational trade, especially in the post-Uruguay\r\nRound era, is an exceptional instrument for generating\r\nexternal earnings and promoting development. At the\r\nsame time, the rapid liberalization of international trade\r\nand the advent of the Uruguay Round have had a negative\r\nimpact on many developing countries. Thus, as previously\r\nwarned by the Secretary-General, African countries could\r\nstand to lose up to $3 billion in foreign earnings by the\r\nturn of the century. It is therefore of critical importance\r\nthat the World Trade Organization (WTO) closely\r\nmonitor this critical situation and seek ways to alleviate\r\nthe problem. In this regard, we welcome the proposed\r\nconsideration at the forthcoming meeting of the Trade and\r\nDevelopment Board of a joint programme of WTO, the\r\nInternational Trade Centre and the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on\r\ntechnical assistance to selected least developed and other\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nOther areas that could also be given priority\r\nattention by the international community include support\r\nfor the promotion of human resources capacities, for the\r\ndiversification of African economies, especially those\r\ndependent on a single commodity or small number of\r\ncommodities, and for Africa’s own efforts in South-South\r\ncooperation. Such cooperation deserves the support of the\r\ninternational community through various means, including\r\ntrilateral arrangements. We urge the developed countries\r\nto provide this backing. For our part in Indonesia, we are,\r\nas in the past, fully committed to the further strengthening\r\nof South-South cooperation. We are continuing to build\r\nupon our South-South cooperation programmes and\r\nprojects, especially activities of a technical cooperation\r\namong developing countries (TCDC) nature with African\r\ncountries. These we plan to build on and strengthen in the\r\nfuture.\r\nIn conclusion, as we — the international\r\ncommunity — embark on the second half of the decade,\r\ncertain facts have become clear. There is still obviously\r\na lot more to be done if the Agenda is to be successfully\r\nimplemented. To achieve this, I believe that international\r\nsupport and partnership should be reinforced with\r\nconcrete and specific steps. Indonesia is committed to\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nfully supporting any means that promise to accelerate the\r\nimplementation of the Agenda.\r\nMr. Hamdan (Lebanon)(interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe problems suffered by all the African countries, albeit\r\nin varying degrees, require increased attention from the\r\ninternational community. This is because of the close\r\ninterrelationship and joint interests among members of the\r\ninternational community and the common destiny that binds\r\nus together once we recognize that we live in a global\r\nvillage in which geographic borders cannot protect others\r\nfrom the physical or mental effects of those problems. The\r\nproblems in Africa adversely affect the world environment\r\nand bring the conscience of the world as a whole face to\r\nface with the worsening humanitarian tragedy of millions of\r\npeople, because of wars and conflicts that have led, in\r\naddition to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people,\r\nto the flow of millions of refugees as a result of the high\r\nlevels of poverty, malnutrition and communicable diseases.\r\nOn the other hand, the prosperity of the countries of\r\nthis continent and the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the continent could undoubtedly contribute\r\nin a dynamic manner to the promotion of the world\r\neconomy and increased global welfare. Africa is replete\r\nwith vast resources and can turn from being a burden on\r\nthe international community into an active partner that\r\nenhances the welfare of that community. We are convinced\r\nthat investment in the resolution of Africa’s problems is an\r\ninvestment in future profitability. It is true that the main\r\nresponsibility for the resolution of these problems lies first\r\nwith the countries of the African continent. However, the\r\nassistance of the international community remains essential\r\nand important to enable these countries to achieve these\r\nsolutions.\r\nInvestment in human beings is still the best way of\r\nattaining sustainable development. The management of\r\nresources and the achievement of political, social and\r\neconomic stability are dependent on decisions made by\r\nindividual people. We cannot propose theoretical\r\napproaches to correct imbalances and solve existing\r\nproblems, however scientific these approaches may be,\r\nunless we first ensure a human response. Africa has already\r\nmoved a long way in this direction. However, it still needs\r\nmore programmes directed towards human resources. This\r\nprinciple, of course, applies to all countries and regions of\r\nthe world. Such a belief might well have led to the\r\norganization of the series of world conferences since the\r\nstart of the present decade, all of which were directed\r\ntowards human welfare.\r\nWe have had the privilege of working in Africa for\r\nsome time, and last year we chaired a group of members\r\nof the Executive Board of the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, which visited several African countries to look\r\nclosely at the cooperation programmes that it was\r\nundertaking there. We became fully convinced that\r\ninherited social problems are the most serious impediment\r\nto sustainable development in Africa. Combating these\r\nproblems cannot be achieved only through various\r\neconomic programmes. There must also be programmes\r\ndirected at local communities to enhance their capacities\r\nand increase their integration in the development process.\r\nModern technology provides an effective means of\r\nimplementing these programmes, and such technology and\r\nappropriate support resources should be provided for\r\nAfrica.\r\nFocusing on the political and managerial aspects of\r\nsystems for national action in Africa should not divert our\r\nattention from the various real obstacles impeding the\r\nachievement of the desired structural reforms. The\r\nexperiences of others can act as useful examples,\r\nprovided that we do not limit ourselves to considering\r\nonly the outcomes, but examine all the various stages.\r\nDemocracy, the need to defend human rights, the\r\nelimination of the manifestations of corruption and the\r\nadoption of the concept of national accountability all\r\nrequire a realization by the public that the issue is one of\r\nconviction, not coercion.\r\nAchieving the desired progress in these reforms\r\nrequires a realistic approach and a long-term effort, in\r\naddition to positive cooperation on the part of the\r\ninternational community. It is time for us to strive for\r\nanother model of international relations, based on\r\nencouragement and incentive, not deterrence and\r\nintimidation. In addition, it is unfair to hold Africa alone\r\nresponsible for the failure of development programmes so\r\nfar to achieve the desired results. Africa’s partners are\r\nalso responsible for this failure. The deterioration in the\r\nprice of primary commodities and the brutal exploitation\r\nby transnationals of the weak points in African countries,\r\nespecially by encouraging corruption, the lack of official\r\ndevelopment assistance from the donor community and\r\nthe withholding of necessary technology, in addition to\r\nindebtedness, have all contributed to the failure of these\r\nprogrammes. The international community must\r\nreconsider its relationship with Africa from the\r\nperspective of joint responsibility, not of relief.\r\nLebanon expresses its solidarity with Africa not only\r\nbecause it is a developing country, but also because it is\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nlinked with many of the countries of that continent through\r\nliving bonds that go back 130 years. Many Lebanese\r\nemigrants settled in African countries and were integrated\r\ninto their social, human and economic fabric, becoming\r\ncitizens. We cannot forget that those countries opened their\r\ndoors to receive tens of thousands of our people during the\r\nperiod of Lebanon’s plight from 1975 to 1991. We\r\ntherefore believe that the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa and the recommendations of the\r\nmid-term review of the implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s acquire special importance. We call strongly for a\r\ncollective, positive response to the implementation of that\r\nInitiative, and for the implementation of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee’s recommendations.\r\nIn conclusion, we would also like to commend the\r\ncontributions, assistance and cooperation programmes\r\nprovided by the donor community, whether States,\r\nindividuals, or regional and international organizations.\r\nMrs. Dengo (Costa Rica): I have the honour of\r\naddressing the General Assembly on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China on the mid-term review of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), which\r\nwas completed in September 1996. We would also like to\r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Owada on\r\nhis successful stewardship of the review process.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China welcome the outcome of\r\nthe mid-term review transmitted to the General Assembly\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s note. In this context, we also\r\ntake note of the report of the Joint Inspection Unit\r\ncontained in document A/50/885.\r\nThe complexity and seriousness of the African\r\ndevelopment problem demands understanding and\r\nsolidarity. Indeed, the mid-term review of UN-NADAF\r\nconfirms that, despite some positive changes that seem to\r\nhave emerged over the last few years at both the economic\r\nand political levels, the dire straits in which the African\r\ncontinent finds itself has been exacerbated by several\r\nconflicts in some parts of the continent. For these reasons,\r\nthe Group of 77 and China still firmly believe that Africa\r\nis a unique case that will test international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment for some time to come.\r\nThe majority of African countries have continued to\r\nundertake several measures in order to improve the\r\nperformance of their economies with a view to paving the\r\nway for more sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. These countries have embraced\r\nmacroeconomic policy transformation and strengthened\r\nregional and subregional economic cooperation. They are\r\nactively promoting private investment and South-South\r\ncooperation as well as undertaking far-reaching political\r\nand social reforms such as the intensification of the\r\ndemocratization process and the participation of civil\r\nsociety in the development process. In spite of resource\r\nlimitations, African countries are integrating the outcomes\r\nof the various United Nations conferences and summits\r\ninto their national development plans and programmes.\r\nIt is imperative for the African countries to continue\r\nto obtain a significant amount of external support,\r\nespecially in the form of official development assistance,\r\nin order to be able to create the national enabling\r\nenvironment and establish the necessary conditions to\r\nattract foreign investment and create a productive base\r\nthat will allow them to participate and compete effectively\r\nin the international market place.\r\nFinally, the Group of 77 and China is convinced that\r\nthe urgent measures and recommendations agreed upon\r\nreflect a concrete attempt at a focused response that will\r\nenable some of the critical areas spelt out in UN-NADAF\r\nto be implemented by the year 2001. This is the minimum\r\nthat the international community can do to support\r\nAfrica’s own efforts.\r\nI wish to conclude by reiterating the solidarity of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China and its firm commitment to the\r\ndevelopment of Africa and to the efforts aimed at\r\naccelerating the implementation of UN-NADAF. As\r\ndeveloping countries, and in the spirit of South-South\r\ncooperation, we stand ready to extend our full support.\r\nMr. Gumbi (South Africa): South Africa actively\r\nparticipated in the recently concluded mid-term review of\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), which from 16 to 20\r\nSeptember 1996 took stock of the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF over the last five years. We endorse the\r\noutcome of that review, especially the report of the Ad\r\nHoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly\r\nfor the mid-term review of UN-NADAF.\r\nIn this context, my delegation would like to thank\r\nthe Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of\r\nthe General Assembly, Ambassador Owada of Japan, for\r\nhis tireless efforts in ensuring the successful outcome of\r\nthe mid-term review. Not least, we would like also to\r\nthank the working groups’ two Vice-Chairmen,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana and Ambassador\r\nAlex Reyn of Belgium, as well as the Rapporteur,\r\nMr. Dušan Rovenský of the Czech Republic, for their work\r\nduring the mid-term review.\r\nMy delegation believes that the General Assembly\r\ndebate on the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s is a\r\nwelcome opportunity to once again highlight the challenges\r\nfacing the African continent and the role of the international\r\ncommunity in helping the African countries confront these\r\nchallenges. It is thus an occasion of great importance. In\r\nthis context, my delegation would also like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/51/228 and Add.1). We\r\nalso associate ourselves fully with the draft resolution\r\nbefore this Assembly on the mid-term review of\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nThe success of this mid-term review attests to the\r\ncontinuing commitment of the international community to\r\nAfrica’s development. This was underlined by the\r\nparticipation of many delegations and international and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the mid-term review. But in\r\nthe final analysis, it was the seriousness and sense of\r\npurpose characteristic of the participation of all the African\r\ndelegations that took part in the review that ensured that the\r\noutcome of the process indeed had relevance and meaning\r\nfor the millions of Africans who continue to hope for a\r\nbetter tomorrow free of hunger, disease and illiteracy.\r\nWhile it is not the intention of my delegation to repeat\r\nhere the debate that took place during the review of\r\nUN-NADAF, we would like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to a few of the salient recommendations contained\r\nin the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole. We\r\nfully agree that the pursuit of democratization, the\r\npromotion of and respect for all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, good governance and administrative\r\nreform are essential to creating an enabling environment for\r\nthe sustained and sustainable growth and development of\r\nAfrica. We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and\r\ndeepening economic reforms and improving the physical\r\nand institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting\r\nfurther domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial.\r\nThe importance of the complementary technical and\r\nfinancial support of the international community in this\r\nregard cannot be overemphasized.\r\nWe are heartened by the attention that has been given\r\nto the need for cooperation between Africa and the\r\ninternational community to enhance African development\r\nby creating favourable conditions for achieving stability in\r\nprivate capital flows and for preventing destabilization\r\narising from swift movements of these flows. We agree\r\nwith the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee’s\r\nreport that development needs to be undergirded by a\r\nhuman development dimension, and that people are at the\r\ncentre of the international community’s concerns for\r\nsustainable development.\r\nOur participation in the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) underlines the\r\nimportance we attach to subregional economic integration,\r\nwith the ultimate aim of full implementation of the Abuja\r\nTreaty Establishing the African Economic Community.\r\nOur determination to pursue South-South cooperation is\r\nshown by the growing cooperation between SADC and\r\nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). It is\r\nthe intention of our subregion to expand such South-South\r\ncooperation with other subregions in the developing\r\nworld.\r\nWe would like to re-emphasize our strong belief that\r\nthe greatest challenge before the international community\r\nwith regard to Africa’s development is to address the two-\r\nheaded dragon of Africa’s crushing external debt burden\r\nand the overreliance of its economies on raw\r\ncommodities. Until these two challenges in particular are\r\naddressed, Africa’s capacity to mobilize resources at the\r\ndomestic level will continue to be stunted, and its reliance\r\non fickle and declining official development assistance\r\nand inflows of external resources will be unavoidable.\r\nIn conclusion, these two areas are of primary\r\nimportance to the aims and objectives of UN-NADAF and\r\nneed to be addressed effectively by the international\r\ncommunity in the remaining years of the New Agenda.\r\nWe also underline the importance of implementing the\r\nrecommendations as agreed during the mid-term review,\r\nand, to further the achievement of this objective, we\r\nemphasize the need for a proper follow-up, monitoring\r\nand evaluation mechanism to be put in place throughout\r\nthe United Nations system. In this regard, it is our\r\nconsidered view that the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa has a great role to play as a\r\ncomplement to UN-NADAF. In the interim, we look\r\nforward to the successful implementation of UN-NADAF\r\nas well as to its appraisal and final review in 2002.\r\nMr. Jallow (Gambia): My delegation has taken due\r\nnote of the report of the Ad Hoc Committee for the mid-\r\nterm review of the implementation of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF). We note as well the distinguished\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nleadership of this Committee by Ambassador Hisashi\r\nOwada of Japan and his able Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador\r\nInsanally of Guyana, Ambassador Reyn of Belgium, and\r\nAmbassador Réwaka of Gabon.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the draft resolution on\r\nthe subject, and strongly recommends its unanimous\r\nadoption by the General Assembly as an expression of the\r\ninternational community’s continued support for\r\nUN-NADAF. The outcome of the mid-term review of\r\nUN-NADAF reaffirms, among other things, the enduring\r\ncompact between Africa and the international community to\r\nensure the implementation of the New Agenda and the\r\nachievement of its goals and objectives within the\r\nestablished time-frame. The mid-term review confirmed that\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF during the second half of\r\nits implementation phase will require greater adherence to\r\nthe commitments made, and greater and consistent\r\nprovision of the requisite resources, making possible an\r\nenabling environment for successfully achieving its\r\nobjectives and ensuring a more effectively coordinated and\r\ncoherent approach to the implementation process.\r\nAccording to the report on of the mid-term review, the\r\nestimated resource mobilization levels of the New Agenda\r\nare still far from being attained, and the key development\r\ngoals are yet to be met, in particular the goal of achieving\r\nan average annual growth rate of real gross national product\r\nof at least 6 per cent for African countries.\r\nThe implementation of UN-NADAF has been the\r\nsubject of ongoing consideration by the General Assembly\r\nand other organs of the United Nations, reinforcing the\r\nimportance attached to the successful implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda while acknowledging its strengths and\r\nweaknesses. One major factor militating against the\r\nsuccessful implementation of UN-NADAF and impeding\r\nthe accelerated economic recovery of Africa is the debt\r\noverhang, which continues to grow in volume in spite of\r\ndebt reduction measures introduced since the beginning of\r\nUN-NADAF. It is therefore important to formulate new\r\ninitiatives that would go beyond the Toronto terms, the\r\nenhanced Trinidad and Tobago initiative, the Naples terms,\r\nexisting bilateral and multilateral debt relief programmes,\r\nand present market initiatives to restructure private debt.\r\nThe international community’s implementation of debt-\r\nreduction initiatives adopted in the 1990s has not fully\r\nproduced the desired positive results. These initiatives have\r\nfailed to equal the magnitude and complexity of the\r\nexternal debt burden of Africa. We note that bilateral debt\r\nis constantly rising and has remained the major component\r\nof Africa’s external debt. Yet the relief treatment so far\r\nintroduced, apart from giving African countries temporary\r\nrelief from their bilateral debt burden, has failed to\r\nprovide adequate relief for all African States, irrespective\r\nof their categorization as middle-income, slightly indebted\r\nor heavily- indebted countries.\r\nSecondly, this situation is compounded by the ever-\r\ngrowing arrears of debt servicing. The failure of Africa to\r\nmeet its external debt obligations has eroded the\r\nconfidence in African economies and has consequently\r\nmade it difficult to attract new investment from sources\r\nother than multilateral institutions. In this connection, the\r\ndebt situation remains dismally unchanged in spite of\r\nefforts by Africa and the international community to\r\ncollectively find a suitable and acceptable debt relief\r\ninitiative or strategy. Africa’s external debt has continued\r\nto rise, and exceeded $310 billion in 1994. My colleague\r\nfrom Ghana was able to confirm that it is now up to $320\r\nbillion. Debt servicing has now reached an average of $28\r\nbillion, which exceeds by far the yearly target of $9\r\nbillion recommended by UN-NADAF.\r\nOne of the effects of the debt overhang that\r\nconstitutes another factor militating against the sustained\r\ndevelopment and economic growth of African countries\r\nis the decline in foreign direct investment. Records\r\nindicate that while foreign direct investment has been\r\ngrowing appreciably in other regions of the world in the\r\n1990s, it has failed to register significant growth in\r\nvolume in Africa and, in the process, has also failed to\r\nintroduce to the region the transfer of technology and\r\nhuman skills that accompany it.\r\nDuring this decade, less than 2 per cent of foreign\r\ndirect investment flows have been received in Africa,\r\nmaintaining a level of flow of about $3 billion a year.\r\nThis low level of foreign direct investment in Africa,\r\nconcentrated mostly in the petroleum and mining\r\nindustries, implies a failure to meet the commitments and\r\nobjectives identified under UN-NADAF. The decline in\r\nforeign direct investment flows has seriously affected\r\nAfrica’s capacity to market the value of its products,\r\nimprove its technical expertise in the various sectors of\r\nthe economy, and maintain the attractiveness of its\r\ninvestment potentials.\r\nAfrica’s cumulative benefits from globalization and\r\nliberalization have been limited by the narrowness of\r\nAfrica’s participation in world trade and disadvantageous\r\nworld market forces, contrary to the objectives of\r\nUN-NADAF, the Uruguay Round agreements and other\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 4 November 1996\r\nconcessionary rates provided by its development partners.\r\nExports from Africa account for less than 3 per cent of the\r\ntotal volume of world trade as a result of tariffs and access\r\nrestrictions, which, in spite of the commitments under\r\nUN-NADAF, have not been removed.\r\nAfrica has made remarkable efforts to achieve the\r\ngoals of UN-NADAF in accordance with its various\r\ncommitments and responsibilities. In this regard, we note\r\nthat the democratization process in Africa has accelerated\r\nduring the period, with greater attention paid to the\r\naccepted principles of governance, democracy, the rule of\r\nlaw and respect for and preservation of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. In the same vein, African\r\nGovernments are allocating more of their national budgets\r\nto building their social and economic infrastructures, in\r\nparticular to strengthening the health, education,\r\nemployment, environmental, communication and transport\r\nsectors. The gains from these investments remain slight,\r\ndue mainly to limited resource allocations, as well as the\r\npresence of other factors militating against sustained\r\ndevelopment in these areas.\r\nOne factor associated with these obstacles is poverty.\r\nThe incidence of poverty is widespread in Africa and has\r\nseriously affected Africa’s efforts to achieve sustainable\r\nhuman development and economic growth and recovery.\r\nThe failure to formulate an effective strategy for poverty\r\neradication in Africa has added to the growing problem of\r\npoverty. The international community’s commitment to\r\npoverty eradication, adopted in Copenhagen at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, should, within the\r\nframework of UN-NADAF, ensure the provision of\r\ngreater assistance and resources for the eradication of\r\npoverty in Africa, which today lags behind the other\r\nregions of the world in fighting and overcoming absolute\r\npoverty.\r\nThe implementation of UN-NADAF during the\r\nsecond half of the programme will require great effort on\r\nthe part of Africa and the international community to\r\novercome the obstacles and shortcomings identified; one\r\nmust build on the successes of the UN-NADAF\r\nprogramme so far achieved. There is also a need for the\r\npartners to remain firm in their collective responsibilities\r\nand commitments so crucial to the overall successful\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF. The recently launched\r\nUnited Nations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa\r\nis expected to be complementary to UN-NADAF, and to\r\nprovide it with much needed stimulus to ensure its\r\neffective implementation.\r\nThe primary concern for the successful\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF remains the responsibility\r\nof Africa, which should, among other considerations,\r\ncontinue its efforts to successfully mobilize the required\r\naggregate $82.5 billion. Facilitating the effective\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF in order to improve\r\nsocio-economic conditions and living standards in African\r\ncountries through economic growth should be the concern\r\nand commitment of the international community.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that in order to facilitate the conduct of the\r\nelection of members to the International Law\r\nCommission, under agenda item 17 (a), on Monday, 11\r\nNovember 1996, we shall proceed, in accordance with\r\nestablished practice, to seek a decision by the General\r\nAssembly on the matter of requesting the Secretariat to\r\nissue a revised, updated list of candidates reflecting all\r\nsubmissions received.
