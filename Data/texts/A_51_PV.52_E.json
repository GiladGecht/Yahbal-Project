On that day, the Assembly\r\nwill proceed to the election of 34 members of the\r\nCommission whose term of office is to commence on 1\r\nJanuary 1997. It should be recalled that, in accordance with\r\nthe statute of the International Law Commission, the\r\nSecretary-General communicated to the Governments of\r\nMember States, in document A/51/177, the list of\r\ncandidates submitted within the required time for the\r\nsubmission of nominations — that is, by 1 June 1996. The\r\nstatements of the qualifications of the candidates are\r\ncontained in document A/51/178.\r\nSubsequent to that date, the Secretary-General\r\nreceived additional information concerning candidates as\r\nwell as new candidatures. The names of these new\r\ncandidates and additional information are to be found in\r\ndocuments A/51/177/Add.1-6 and A/51/178/Add.1.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is necessary for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to take a decision as to whether these\r\nnew candidatures should be accepted in spite of the\r\nsubmission of their names subsequent to the deadline and\r\nwhether they should be incorporated into a consolidated\r\nlist of candidates. It has been the practice of the\r\nAssembly to incorporate such late submissions into a\r\nconsolidated list.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to request the Secretary-General to\r\nissue such a consolidated list of candidates.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The consolidated list of candidates\r\nwill be issued as document A/51/653.\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nAgenda item 44 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\nReport of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of\r\nthe General Assembly for the Mid-term Review of\r\nthe Implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(A/51/48)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/228 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/51/48, sect. IV)\r\nMr. Kiwanuka (Uganda): Allow me first of all to\r\nthank Ambassador Hisashi Owada, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Japan and Chairman of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the\r\nMid-term Review of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, for the successful\r\nconduct of the review of the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nWe also thank the other members of the Bureau — namely\r\nthe representatives of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Gabon\r\nand Guyana — and, indeed, all the delegations whose\r\nactive participation helped to enliven the debate on African\r\ndevelopment and thus made an invaluable contribution to\r\nthe review process.\r\nThe social, economic and political circumstances and\r\nconditions in which African countries find themselves\r\ntoday, the loaded agenda for international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, and the ongoing efforts to define a people-\r\ncentred and environmentally acceptable road to economic\r\ngrowth and development, among other factors, lend a high\r\ndegree of complexity to a process such as the one that has\r\njust been completed. The outcome of such a process,\r\ntherefore, will necessarily be a mixed bag that attempts to\r\nrespond to the expectations of all. It is with these\r\nconsiderations in mind that Uganda welcomes and endorses\r\nthe outcome of the mid-term review of UN-NADAF.\r\nThe conclusion of the mid-term review, in a nutshell,\r\nis that UN-NADAF remains largely unimplemented and that\r\nthe socio-economic conditions that prompted the launching\r\nof the United Nations Programme of Action for African\r\nEconomic Recovery and Development in 1986 and the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s have persisted. Nevertheless, there has been\r\nsome progress towards economic recovery, gross national\r\nproduct growth rates of up to 6 per cent being attained in\r\na handful of African countries. Overall, poverty and\r\nunemployment will increase substantially while official\r\ndevelopment assistance continues to decline in real terms\r\nand the debt burden remains unsustainable. While we\r\nrecognize primary responsibility for our development, a\r\ndecisive breakthrough, as in the case of most developing\r\ncountries, depends on a high degree of external support\r\nand on a favourable external economic environment.\r\nThe New Agenda expires in the year 2001. The most\r\noptimistic assessment and projection would have to\r\nconclude that it is not possible to deliver on all the\r\ncommitments undertaken by Africa and the international\r\ncommunity in UN-NADAF. The approach of the mid-\r\nterm review was to identify the key critical areas and to\r\nmake concrete recommendations on what tangible actions\r\ncan be undertaken in the five remaining years. We believe\r\nthis is a practical approach. However, contingent upon the\r\nfinal evaluation in the year 2002, we might have to\r\nseriously chart the course beyond this decade.\r\nIn doing this, we will have to take due cognizance\r\nof the programmes of action of the major international\r\nconferences and summits held so far. These global\r\nconferences have increased awareness of the fundamental\r\nrelationships between peace, development, environmental\r\nsustainability, social equity and justice as well as between\r\nparticipation, good governance and democracy. Most\r\nAfrican countries have accepted these basic paradigms\r\nthat must inform sustainable development. At the global\r\nlevel, the international community must match this\r\nrenewed awareness with action consistent with the\r\ncommitments entered into at the conferences. This is not\r\nonly a moral imperative, but good common sense in a\r\nworld that is increasingly without boundaries and in\r\nwhich our destinies are inextricably interlinked.\r\nWe applaud the commitment undertaken at the mid-\r\nterm review to effect urgent measures to accelerate the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF. In order to translate this\r\ncommitment into programmes, it is necessary to\r\nreinvigorate the follow-up arrangements for the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. At the national level,\r\nit is necessary that Governments work hand in hand with\r\nthe United Nations system and the donor community to\r\nintegrate these undertakings into the country cooperation\r\nframeworks. At the regional level, the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa must ensure that the undertakings\r\nin the areas of subregional and regional cooperation and\r\nintegration are promoted through essential transport,\r\ncommunication and trade projects, among others. At the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nglobal level, we believe that the enhanced involvement of\r\nthe Secretary-General in advocacy for African development\r\nas well as in the sensitization of the key players — African\r\nGovernments, the funds, programmes and agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations system, the Bretton Woods institutions, the\r\ntrade institutions and the donor community — would\r\ndefinitely give added impetus to the implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda. Likewise, the contribution of non-\r\ngovernmental actors, an aspect that received deserved\r\nattention during the mid-term review, is most welcome.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): What is happening in Africa? In 1960 the future\r\nbelonged to it. The energy and pride of the new generation\r\nready to take matters in hand seemed to guarantee an\r\neconomic and social development that would be worthy of\r\nits ancient and numerous peoples. In 1990, social upheaval,\r\nAIDS, debt, lack of investment, poverty, unemployment and\r\nthe decline of the social fabric and of democracy seemed\r\ntoo widespread to be mere side-effects of a development\r\nprocess that was slow to materialize.\r\nThe end of apartheid in South Africa seemed to offer\r\na new impetus, together with other events in Africa. I\r\nremember how moved I was when that great country\r\nresumed its seat in the General Assembly in June 1994 and,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Western European and other\r\nStates, I had the great privilege of welcoming it here.\r\nAs my colleague from Canada, Mr. Fowler, pointed\r\nout at yesterday afternoon’s meeting, in 1996 the recovery\r\nof Africa is very much on the agenda. African leaders are\r\nincreasingly embracing democratic practices; they are aware\r\nof the requirements of economic pragmatism to bring their\r\ncountries out of the tunnel. The time for idealistic optimism\r\nis over in Africa; now is the time for optimism driven by\r\nwill. The time of major programmes and major financing\r\nhas passed. In Africa now, the time has come for targeted\r\nprogrammes and effective and responsible economic and\r\nfiscal policies.\r\nHowever, the Principality of Andorra, a small State\r\nwith limited resources, has a feeling of solidarity with\r\nAfrica. We are very close, just across the Mediterranean.\r\nAbove all, we are convinced that the development of the\r\nworld depends on the development of Africa. Shame on\r\nhumanity if the twenty-first century sees the collapse of\r\nAfrica. Andorra contributes what it can to the development\r\nof the continent. Andorran doctors and nurses are working\r\nthere in cooperation programmes. Andorran teachers are\r\ntraining young Africans; for example, our Ambassador in\r\nParis, Madame Mateu, has often spoken to me of the years\r\nshe spent teaching in a high school in Cameroon.\r\nMoreover, my country has tried every year to increase its\r\ndirect assistance for development through the United\r\nNations. And I must not forget the contribution of the\r\nAndorran non-governmental organizations dedicated\r\nspecifically to this.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s calls for strengthening education\r\nsystems by improving basic skills for further learning and\r\nexpanding educational opportunities for all, particularly\r\ngirls and women. We might reflect on the fact that in the\r\ndeveloping countries, where 84 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation between 15 and 24 years of age lives, more\r\nthan 100 million new jobs need to be created in the next\r\ntwo decades to absorb the growing numbers of active\r\nyoung people. These young people need to be given the\r\nnecessary means to contribute to the development of their\r\ncountries. First of all, they need to be trained for the jobs\r\nand professions required to relaunch their countries’\r\neconomies, which calls for a clear analysis and\r\ndevelopment strategies at both the State level and also —\r\nvery important — the local community level. The schools\r\nand universities must, then, through their teaching,\r\npropagate the primacy of the universal human rights of\r\nmen and women, as provided in Article 29 of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, and the spirit of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nAt the Social Summit in Copenhagen, the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra advocated one of the\r\ncommitments, on dialogue between generations. It\r\nconsiders that a true partnership must be forged between\r\nthe young and older people in order to ensure that the\r\nAfrican heritage is passed on intact and at the same time\r\nto foster the ideas that can guide Africa to success in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\nwelcome the opportunity to address the Assembly on the\r\nimportant item entitled “Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s”. The development of Africa has, for the last\r\ndecade been a preoccupation in the work of this\r\nAssembly, from the special session in 1986 which\r\nadopted the United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development to the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) today. While such\r\nefforts have been expanded to address Africa’s\r\ndevelopment problems, the circumstances that led to the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nadoption of UN-PAAERD and UN-NADAF are as valid\r\ntoday as they were in 1986 and 1991. In fact, social and\r\neconomic conditions have actually deteriorated over the past\r\ndecade.\r\nAlthough Africa faces enormous problems, it has the\r\npotential for growth and development. That is why it has\r\nembarked on an ambitious reform process aimed at\r\nharnessing that potential and in the full recognition that its\r\ndevelopment is, in the final analysis, its own responsibility.\r\nIn that regard the continent has seized the challenge and\r\nAfrican countries have committed themselves to implement\r\npolicies and programmes aimed at creating an environment\r\nconducive to growth and development. This has enabled\r\nAfrica to halt the deteriorating trend and in many cases to\r\nregister modest growth. This is but the beginning, which\r\ncan only be sustained if there is a supportive international\r\nenvironment in terms of increased financial resources and\r\nother mechanisms.\r\nIncreased resources are critical if the process of reform\r\nand restructuring is to be sustained. We need this\r\nparticularly because progress in Africa is beneficial not\r\nonly to the African people. Given the interdependence of\r\nthe world’s economies, the whole of mankind stands to\r\nbenefit from such progress. This has been duly recognized\r\nin the New Agenda. Needless to say, the report of the Ad\r\nHoc Committee for the mid-term review of UN-NADAF\r\nwhich is before us also attests to this point.\r\nWe believe that for Africa’s development efforts to be\r\nmeaningful, there is a need for the international community\r\nto come together in partnership with Africa to address, in\r\na comprehensive manner, the problems facing the continent\r\nand to find lasting solutions. There is also an urgent need\r\nto review the determination and commitment to implement\r\nUN-NADAF so as to enable Africa to achieve social and\r\neconomic development goals. In that regard, we welcome\r\nthe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica. We hope that the Initiative will provide an\r\nadditional impetus for the operationalization of\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nOne of the steps that can facilitate the realization of\r\nthe goals and objectives of UN-NADAF is to address the\r\ndebt burden of most African countries. Africa’s external\r\nindebtedness increased from $300 billion in 1991 to $322\r\nbillion in 1995, an 8 per cent increase over four years. With\r\nsuch an unsustainable level of external indebtedness, it is\r\nobvious that any efforts undertaken to generate capital\r\nneeded for development will not succeed. Therefore, in\r\naddition to the significant steps taken by the creditors to\r\nalleviate the debt problem, further measures are necessary\r\nto address effectively, and in a comprehensive manner,\r\nthe problems of heavily indebted low-income developing\r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa.\r\nAs we enter the sixth year of UN-NADAF\r\nimplementation, the gap between Africa and the\r\ndeveloped countries continues to widen. This is\r\nmanifested in increasing levels of poverty, declining terms\r\nof trade, declining levels of official development\r\nassistance, lack of progress in the transfer of technology,\r\nand, above all, in the downgrading of the issue of\r\ndevelopment from its priority place on the international\r\nagenda. In this context, it is our view that for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment efforts to bear fruit, there is an urgent need\r\nto create a conducive international environment that\r\nwould include a substantial increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nCommodity trade remains the major source of\r\nearnings in all African countries. In this regard, the\r\nimpact of the implementation of the Uruguay Round —\r\nconsidered a landmark in world trade — on countries in\r\nAfrica is still ambiguous, particularly in the areas of\r\nmarket access, agriculture and the erosion of preferential\r\ntreatment for Africa’s commodity exports. As we move to\r\nimplement the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules\r\nrelating to commodities, there remains a pressing need, at\r\nleast in the transitional stage, to safeguard the preferential\r\ntreatment that Africa enjoyed under the Lomé Convention.\r\nThis would enable Africa to adjust to economic\r\ndiversification, which it must do if it is to build its\r\ncompetitiveness in world markets.\r\nThe forthcoming ministerial meeting of the World\r\nTrade Organization, scheduled for December 1996 in\r\nSingapore, will be another opportunity to monitor and\r\nreview the Uruguay Round’s impact on countries in\r\nAfrica. The Singapore meeting should not, therefore, be\r\nused to address new issues. While some of these issues\r\nmay be legitimate, we believe that there are other\r\ncompetent bodies within the United Nations system that\r\ncan address them more comprehensively than the rule-\r\nsetting mechanism of the WTO. We therefore hope that\r\nthe Singapore meeting will be allowed to devote full\r\nattention to the review of the implementation process of\r\nthe Uruguay Round agreements.\r\nThis is all the more necessary when we consider that\r\nAfrica’s efforts to restructure and reform governmental\r\nlaws and procedures in order to attract more foreign direct\r\ninvestment have not borne fruit. Indeed, the argument that\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nshortfalls in official development assistance have been\r\ncompensated for by increased foreign direct investment\r\nflows to developing countries has not held true in the case\r\nof most African countries.\r\nBy and large, Africa lacks the resources needed to\r\nundertake all the necessary restructuring and build an\r\ninfrastructure that can attract and support sustained flows of\r\nforeign direct investment. Even in the rare cases where such\r\ninfrastructure has been instituted, foreign direct investment\r\nhas not been forthcoming, at least not at a rate and levels\r\nthat could have a positive impact and enable Africa to make\r\nan economic turnaround. This is due partly to the hesitancy\r\nof investors to venture into new and untested markets,\r\nnotwithstanding the statistical fact that the level of return on\r\ninvestments in Africa is one of the highest. But this\r\nhesitancy could be a result of deep-seated prejudices\r\nengendered by the propaganda that Africa is a continent in\r\nwhich instability and conflict are endemic. In some cases,\r\nconflicts have plagued individual African countries. But\r\nthese are very few.\r\nWe therefore hope that it will be possible for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment partners to assist in supporting UN-NADAF,\r\nboth in the mobilization of the resources needed to set up\r\nthe investment-sustaining infrastructure and in the\r\nsensitization process, and to cast away the negative images\r\nthat stand in the way of increased flows of foreign direct\r\ninvestment.\r\nIn conclusion, last September the General Assembly,\r\nthrough its Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole and under the\r\nable chairmanship of Ambassador Owada, concluded the\r\nmid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. The outcome of this\r\nreview reveals that many of the critical social and economic\r\nproblems that led to the adoption of UN-NADAF in 1991\r\nstill exist. In some countries, the problems have worsened.\r\nThe estimated resource mobilization levels in UN-NADAF\r\nare still far from being attained, and key development goals\r\nhave yet to be met. In this regard, the mid-term review of\r\nthe New Agenda reaffirms and underscores the mutuality of\r\ncommitments and the need for Africa and the international\r\ncommunity to take urgent and concrete action, as\r\nrecommended in the review.\r\nThe New Agenda is a framework for global\r\npartnership that needs our collective political will to work.\r\nWe believe that with greater political will and\r\ndetermination, the recommendations contained in the report\r\nof the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole will be\r\nimplemented.\r\nMrs. Cornette (Guyana): My delegation was pleased\r\nto participate in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of\r\nthe Whole of the General Assembly for the Mid-term\r\nReview of the Implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,\r\nwhich met in September this year to examine the progress\r\nmade under the Agenda and to determine the actions that\r\nneed to be taken for the remainder of the decade. The\r\nCommittee was fortunate to have as its Chairman His\r\nExcellency Ambassador Hisashi Owada of Japan, whose\r\ndiplomatic experience and skills were in large measure\r\nresponsible for the successful completion of a most\r\nengaged exercise.\r\nThe report of the Committee that is before us is\r\ntestimony to the hard work, dedication and spirit of\r\ncompromise of all the parties concerned — the African\r\ncountries and the international community. Inevitably, the\r\noutcome in such circumstances is less than all may have\r\nwished. Nonetheless, the review does provide a solid\r\nbasis for the accelerated implementation of the New\r\nAgenda and for strengthening the spirit of partnership and\r\nshared responsibility that has imbued it from the start.\r\nThe task before us, however, is far from easy. As the\r\nreview Committee itself has underlined, many of the\r\ncritical social and economic problems that led to the\r\nadoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development in 1986\r\nand of the New Agenda in 1991 still exist and, in some\r\ncountries, have even worsened.\r\nTo cite but one example of the challenges that lie\r\nahead, it is reported that unless decisive action is taken to\r\naddress the issue of food security, an estimated 700\r\nmillion to 800 million people worldwide will remain\r\nchronically food-deprived by the year 2010. In sub-\r\nSaharan Africa alone, the number of people so affected is\r\nexpected to rise to 300 million, or over half the total\r\npopulation of that region. The obstacles to food security\r\nare said to include inadequate agricultural production,\r\nhigh levels of population growth, limited resources and\r\nhigh rates of poverty and unemployment — all of which\r\nare expected to increase in sub-Saharan Africa — and\r\nbudgetary constraints that adversely affect the\r\ndevelopment of physical infrastructure.\r\nAs we have done on previous occasions, my\r\ndelegation urges a strong response from the international\r\ncommunity that is commensurate with Africa’s efforts to\r\nsecure full food security. The timely opportunity of the\r\nWorld Food Summit, to be held in Rome later this month,\r\nto pledge full commitment to eliminating hunger from the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\ncontinent should not be lost. Renewed international support\r\nis also critical in other areas of the Agenda, such as\r\nresource flows, external debt and trade, in order to achieve\r\nthe broad objectives of the Agenda and the integration of\r\nAfrica into the world economy.\r\nMy own country, Guyana, has long been pledged to\r\nsupporting Africa’s efforts of economic recovery and\r\ndevelopment. This solidarity with the African people is\r\nborn of the belief not only that they deserve our\r\ncooperation but also that their circumstances affect all of us\r\nin the developing world. We therefore stand on the side of\r\nAfrican States in their current economic difficulties because\r\nwe understand, and to a great extent share, some of the\r\ndifficulties they now confront.\r\nThe assessment of UN-NADAF, which was completed\r\nlast September, afforded all countries, developed and\r\ndeveloping, the opportunity to look in a balanced manner at\r\nways in which their interests can be harmoniously\r\nreconciled for the benefit of both. It enabled us to reflect on\r\nthe policies not only of Governments but also of the\r\ninternational institutions which give them advice. Donors\r\nand recipients together examined the adequacy and\r\neffectiveness of official development assistance. Equally,\r\nwe attempted to measure the contribution that non-\r\ngovernmental organizations make in the development\r\nprocess, and sought to encourage them to take further\r\ninitiatives of support.\r\nAs we counselled then, we submit once again that it\r\nis advisable that we listen to Africa’s own views on the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. We believe the African\r\npeople are the best judges of the situation and are therefore\r\nmost able to say what else needs to be done. On the basis\r\nof this approach and a frank, constructive analysis of the\r\nrecords, we have striven to recognize the positive\r\nachievements, to demonstrate the courage to admit our\r\nfailures and to devise new strategies for accomplishing our\r\ngoals. Having identified these obstacles, which continue to\r\nfrustrate progress, and wherever possible having made firm\r\nrecommendations for overcoming them, we must now\r\nswiftly implement the actions necessary to give effect to\r\nthose recommendations.\r\nThe deposit of the fiftieth instrument of ratification of\r\nthe United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification\r\nin those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, particularly in Africa, almost immediately\r\nin the wake of the review is a welcome development. Full\r\nsupport by the international community is essential in order\r\nto operationalize its provisions. I am pleased to announce\r\nthat right now my own Government is positively\r\nconsidering early accession to the Convention. We also\r\nwelcome the recent initiative of the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with the\r\nburden of heavily indebted poor countries, and urge its\r\nexpeditious and flexible implementation.\r\nMay I say in closing that UN-NADAF is linked to\r\nthe broader Agenda for Development which we are in the\r\nprocess of negotiating. The lessons drawn from the\r\nreview will benefit not only Africa but the entire\r\ninternational community. We must now turn our full\r\nattention to the expeditious implementation of the New\r\nAgenda. With renewed effort, we believe that the African\r\npredicament can be significantly alleviated, if not solved,\r\nby the end of the next decade.\r\nMr. Diagne (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nWe are gathered here once again to discuss the economic\r\nsituation in Africa, but one must wonder what there is to\r\nbe said or done. This being a debate on the development\r\nof Africa, the delegation of Senegal considers that\r\neverything, or practically everything, has already been\r\nsaid. The analysis has been made, the goals have been set\r\nand the means to achieve them have been identified.\r\nMore than ever before, the time for professions of faith is\r\ndefinitely behind us; the time has come for action.\r\nOnly a few weeks ago, the mid-term review of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF)\r\nallowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved\r\nby African countries at the political, economic and social\r\nlevels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary\r\nfor sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the continent. This progress is all the\r\nmore significant as it has taken place at an accelerated\r\npace over a relatively short period of time and despite an\r\ninternational economic environment that is unfavourable\r\nin many respects.\r\nWhile Africa has done everything possible to meet\r\nits commitments since the establishment of UN-NADAF,\r\nthe facts show that the international community has yet to\r\nshoulder its part of the responsibilities under\r\nUN-NADAF. Whereas a minimum of $32 billion was\r\nrequired to implement the programme, official\r\ndevelopment assistance, paradoxically, has fallen to all-\r\ntime lows. Despite the policies of liberalization and fiscal\r\nreforms, the flow of private capital towards Africa is still\r\ntoo weak. In this regard, the report of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nrelated to world investments during 1996, stresses that out\r\nof the $315 billion spent globally, only $5 billion was\r\ndevoted to Africa.\r\nLikewise, in a document on the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa issued in March\r\nthis year (E/ECA/CM.22/5), the Secretary-General\r\nemphasized that Africa is the only region in the world\r\nwhere poverty is expected to increase during this decade —\r\nthe very decade dedicated to the elimination of poverty.\r\nNow is not the time for promises but for action. The\r\nfailure five years ago of the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction for African Economic Recovery and Development\r\n(UNPAAERD) should serve as a lesson and warning. Our\r\nrecent past shows that whenever the international\r\ncommunity has shown its will to do something, it has met\r\nthe challenges of situations more demanding in terms of\r\nfinancial resources than UN-NADAF.\r\nIt is the profound conviction of my delegation and, no\r\ndoubt, of all other African delegations that our continent\r\ndoes not want to be enclosed within the vicious circle of\r\nassistance and debt. On the contrary, what Africa expects\r\nfrom its partners is the opening of real opportunities so that\r\nit can take its place in the world trade and economic\r\nsystem. The definitive settlement of the debt crisis,\r\nassistance in the diversification of commodities in Africa\r\nand the lifting of customs barriers and other protectionist\r\nmeasures which hinder access of our products to external\r\nmarkets are measures which could help us in our\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nAfrica is a continent with enormous potential. Its\r\nrecovery and economic growth would be a factor in\r\nstimulating the world economy. It is only with a true spirit\r\nof solidarity, complementarity and partnership that the goals\r\nof UN-NADAF can be achieved. This is how my delegation\r\nviews and supports the draft resolution before us.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to congratulate\r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Owada of Japan for his\r\npersonal efforts and those of his Government and for the\r\nextraordinary work accomplished in the mid-term review\r\nUN-NADAF. We also wish to thank and congratulate the\r\nother leaders of the Ad Hoc Committee.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): While the mid-term review\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) might have given hope\r\nfor an improved socio-economic situation, it has, among\r\nothers things, raised concern about Africa’s development\r\nprospects. Five years after the international community\r\nentered into a renewed partnership with Africa, the road\r\nremaining to be covered for the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF is much longer. On the whole, we in Africa\r\nhave democratized, reformed and restructured. Yet, during\r\nthe mid-term review, we found that, rather than\r\nimproving, the situation in some countries has\r\ndeteriorated, as the targets set are far from being achieved\r\nand resources are still lacking.\r\nWhat is needed now, therefore, is not only an\r\nanalysis of the well-known socio-economic problems that\r\nconfront Africa, but also a process for implementing the\r\nrecommendations made during the mid-term review, so as\r\nto complement Africa’s efforts in forging ahead with its\r\nown development.\r\nIt is in this context that my delegation welcomes the\r\noutcome of the mid-term review, including the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, contained in document A/51/228/Add.1,\r\non estimates of projected resource requirements. We also\r\nexpress our thanks and appreciation to the officers of the\r\nAd Hoc Committee for their efforts in steering the\r\ndeliberations to a fruitful conclusion.\r\nOn general resource mobilization, the mid-term\r\nreview identified the factors that impede Africa’s\r\nachievement of development objectives. Among other\r\nfacts, the Secretary-General’s report reiterates, and rightly\r\nso, that exports from Africa cannot penetrate projected\r\nmarkets due to the obstacles that have been created.\r\nFurthermore, the agricultural policies of the industrialized\r\ncountries tend to depress the world market prices of food\r\nproducts.\r\nIndeed, the need for increased mobilization of\r\nresources for the successful implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF cannot be overemphasized. How can Africa\r\nmobilize domestic financial resources when public savings\r\non the whole have fallen below the 1990 level, when\r\nmost of the countries are experiencing a serious decline\r\nin their terms of trade, and when their need to borrow far\r\noutweighs their capacity to pay?\r\nThese are just a few of the questions we hope the\r\nmid-term review has enabled us to pose. We believe it is\r\ncrucial, therefore, inter alia, to address obstacles to\r\nAfrica’s trade performance in a holistic manner, including\r\nensuring increased preferential access to developed\r\ncountry markets for African commodities. Africa’s efforts\r\nin the area of commodity diversification need to be\r\nsupported, as do the physical and institutional\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\ninfrastructure and human resource development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIt has been said time and again that political instability\r\nin Africa — which does not include the whole of Africa —\r\nis among the factors that are to blame for Africa’s\r\nunderdevelopment. We agree with that premise, for we\r\nfully recognize the link between peace and development.\r\nHowever, indications are that foreign direct investment has\r\nbeen selective, concentrating on those industries with the\r\nhighest rate of return despite prevailing political instability.\r\nIt would be misleading to paint an overall gloomy\r\npicture of the economic situation of Africa. Some countries,\r\nincluding Namibia, have managed to attract some degree of\r\nforeign direct investment since 1991. On the whole,\r\nhowever, the trend has been negative, especially for the\r\nleast developed countries. In a word, the few success stories\r\nin Africa have been overshadowed by the overall economic\r\ndecline, and if this trend continues the performance of\r\ncountries with modest economic growth may even drop\r\nbelow the current growth rate.\r\nAfrica’s debt is said to be lowest in volume of all\r\ndeveloping countries; but on the contrary, our inability to\r\npay is the greatest. We need therefore to re-examine the\r\nshortcomings of the measures undertaken so far to address\r\nAfrica’s debt, for the issue is not how much we owe, but\r\nour ability to pay and what the alternatives are. We need\r\nlasting development-oriented solutions to Africa’s debt\r\nproblems.\r\nWe urge the international community to implement its\r\ncommitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct to official development assistance. Furthermore, we\r\nbelieve implementation of the 20/20 initiative, first\r\nembraced by Africa during the International Conference on\r\nAssistance for African Children, held in 1992, complements\r\nour partnership in the implementation of UN-NADAF. We\r\ntherefore welcome the outcome of the Oslo meeting on\r\n20/20 and call on the donor community to assist countries\r\nimplementing the 20/20 initiative.\r\nThe United Nations is centrally located to give the\r\noutcome of the mid-term review the widest possible\r\npublicity among the heads of the agencies and institutions\r\nof the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, and among the donor community. This would\r\ncontribute, we believe, to maximizing resource\r\nmobilization.\r\nWe need to find new ways to follow up and monitor\r\nthe implementation of UN-NADAF at all levels. Relevant\r\nbodies within the United Nations system responsible for\r\nfollow-up should be provided with adequate financial\r\nresources. In addition, we need to examine how we can\r\neffectively monitor the implementation of UN-NADAF\r\nduring the remaining period. An annual review of the\r\nimplementation process would pave the way to an\r\neffective follow-up.\r\nMr. Martinez Blanco (Honduras), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating that, while it is now\r\nin the interest of the African people for Africa to develop,\r\nin the long term, the world will be at risk if Africa\r\ncontinues to be marginalized.\r\nMr. Barnala (India): I would like to congratulate\r\nAmbassador Owada of Japan and the other officers on\r\ntheir efforts in completing the work of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the\r\nMid-term Review of the Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s.\r\nThe outcome of that review is now before us. While\r\nit made a realistic assessment of the current situation, it\r\nwas not able to progress as far as we would have liked in\r\nterms of international cooperation to support Africa’s\r\nefforts. Further measures will be required in the areas of\r\nfinancial flows, trade access and technology transfers if\r\nthe national efforts being made in Africa are to achieve\r\nthe desired results. The deteriorating economic situation\r\nof the African continent has for a considerable period\r\nengaged the attention of the world. Indeed, it has been\r\nprominent on the agenda of the United Nations since the\r\nearly 1990s.\r\nIndia’s ties with the nations of the African continent\r\nare deep and mutually enriching. For us, this valuable\r\nrelationship dates back to the years of our independence\r\nmovement. It was on African soil that the father of our\r\nnation, Mahatma Gandhi, started his non-violent, passive\r\nresistance movement against racial discrimination and\r\nexploitation, as a precursor to our national struggle. India\r\nstruggled side by side with African nations against\r\ncolonialism. At the Asian Relations Conference in New\r\nDelhi in March 1947, even before India had attained\r\npolitical freedom, our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal\r\nNehru, declared that India’s freedom would remain\r\nincomplete until the whole of Africa was free.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nIn 1946 India took the initiative of inscribing the issue\r\nof apartheid on the agenda of the United Nations. Our\r\ncommitment to the anti-apartheid struggle was absolute and\r\nwas accompanied by political, economic and material\r\nsupport. We did not seek any material benefits by trading\r\nwith the apartheid regime in violation of the embargoes.\r\nWe rejoiced at the liberation of the African nations from\r\ncolonial rule, the liberation of Namibia and the final end of\r\napartheid in South Africa.\r\nIndia’s support of subsequent efforts of African\r\ncountries to achieve economic development is rooted in our\r\nlong-standing friendship with the people of Africa, and in\r\nour commitment to South-South cooperation and to the\r\ncause of the economic and social development of African\r\ncountries. This support has manifested itself in tangible\r\nterms. Aside from supporting Africa’s aspirations and\r\nendeavours in multilateral forums, we have shared our\r\nexperiences, resources and capabilities through a high-\r\nquality technical and economic cooperation programme.\r\nIt was at India’s initiative that the Action for Resisting\r\nInvasion, Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund was\r\nestablished by the Non-Aligned Movement to provide\r\nproject aid and other technical assistance to the front-line\r\nStates in various critical areas. By 1992, the AFRICA Fund\r\nhad disbursed up to $500 million in such assistance. Our\r\nactive cooperation with the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) is yet another expression of our desire\r\nto be a partner in development efforts in Africa. Beyond\r\nour close bilateral relations with all African countries, we\r\nhave maintained close links with African regional\r\norganizations, including the Organization of African Unity,\r\nthe African Development Bank, the United Nations\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa, the Common Market for\r\nEastern and Southern Africa, the SADC and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States.\r\nIn February 1996, the India International Centre in\r\nNew Delhi organized a three-day conference entitled\r\n“Understanding Contemporary Africa: India and South-\r\nSouth Cooperation”, which attracted participation from the\r\nmajority of African countries and regional organizations.\r\nIndia also participated in the partners meeting of the United\r\nNations Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa,\r\nin April 1996.\r\nIndia has sought to participate in economic endeavours\r\nin Africa through, inter alia, the Indian Technical and\r\nEconomic Cooperation Programme (ITEC). We have\r\ninteracted with many countries in Africa through technical\r\nassistance in the form of execution of projects, extension of\r\ntraining facilities, the deputation of experts, conducting\r\nfeasibility studies, providing consultants and organizing\r\nstudy visits. More than 20,000 nominees from foreign\r\ncountries, most of them from Africa, have been trained in\r\nIndia under this programme. Among the projects currently\r\nin hand are the establishment of a remote sensing centre\r\nin Nigeria, a vocational training programme centre in\r\nSenegal and several projects in Mauritius. Study visits to\r\nidentify fresh projects in various other countries have also\r\nrecently been undertaken. We have offered training\r\nfacilities in a wide range of fields, such as banking,\r\nfinancial management, hydrology and water resource\r\nmanagement, urban development, mass communications,\r\nfisheries, electronics, satellite image processing,\r\npackaging, food processing, small industries, crop\r\nresearch, sericulture, biogas technology, manpower\r\nplanning and training. There are further South-South\r\ncooperation programmes in other areas, including new\r\nand renewable energy resources, biotechnology and gene\r\nbanks, which India is coordinating on behalf of fellow\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nAfrica is the principal beneficiary of these\r\nprogrammes, and in 1995/96 roughly 6 per cent of the\r\ntechnical assistance rendered by India under the ITEC\r\nprogramme went to countries of the African continent.\r\nWe have cooperated with our brothers and sisters in\r\nAfrica for decades, since our own independence. Our\r\nprogrammes of cooperation with African countries have\r\na long history, rooted in the anti-colonial struggles of the\r\nAfrican people and their quest for economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThere is little doubt that Africa will require\r\nconsiderable support from the international community in\r\norder to achieve its basic development goals. Economic\r\nreforms and structural adjustment programmes must be\r\ndovetailed with international support for measures aimed\r\nat encouraging agricultural and rural development, food\r\nsecurity, investment promotion and integrating population\r\ntrends with development. African economies will also\r\nneed catalytic support from external variables, in terms of\r\nadditional resource flows, better terms of trade for\r\ncommodities, diversification of production and trade and\r\nenhanced foreign direct investment. Debt reduction and\r\nrescheduling measures are also an inalienable part of this\r\nstrategy. The measures so far agreed to in the mid-term\r\nreview will need to be considerably enhanced.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reiterate the fact that\r\nconsensus on the urgency of programmes for the\r\neconomic development of Africa already exists. We are\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\ndiscussing the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. The Declaration on\r\nInternational Economic Cooperation, in particular, the\r\nRevitalization of Economic Growth and Development of the\r\nDeveloping Countries; and the International Development\r\nStrategy for the Fourth United Nations Development\r\nDecade also encompass the countries in the African region.\r\nThe Declaration adopted at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment included a specific commitment to the\r\neconomic, social and human resource development of\r\nAfrica. Work is now under way on an Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. What is lacking, therefore, is not a vision or\r\na set of plans and programmes, but the ready will to\r\ntranslate these into reality. The focus of our discussions and\r\nattention should therefore be on specific steps towards\r\nfulfilling our commitments and responsibilities to our\r\npartners in Africa, and not merely hammering out new\r\ntheologies of development or development cooperation.\r\nMr. Rubadiri (Malawi): May I join those who have\r\nspoken before me to congratulate the President once again\r\non his unanimous election to preside over this year’s\r\nsession. Already his diplomatic skills have confirmed our\r\nconviction that he will be able to guide our deliberations to\r\na successful conclusion. We extend our felicitations to the\r\nother members of the Bureau. We fully associate ourselves\r\nwith the statement of the Group of 77 and China made\r\nyesterday by my colleague, the representative of Costa\r\nRica.\r\nWe welcome the reports of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe “Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s” contained in\r\ndocument A/51/228 and its addendum. We agree that the\r\neconomic and social crisis facing the African continent\r\nsince the early 1980s has continued unabated up to today.\r\nDespite modest achievements attained in some parts of the\r\ncontinent, the general trend and overall outlook remain\r\nbleak. Indeed, the structural constraints to growth have\r\ncontinued, and the social situation, as shown by the\r\ndeclining trends in all the major social indicators, especially\r\nthe increase in poverty, has continued to give rise to\r\nconcern.\r\nThe recently held mid-term review of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) clearly\r\nrevealed that there is a long way to go towards the\r\nrealization of the New Agenda. The report of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the\r\nMid-term Review gives insights into the areas which both\r\nthe African countries and the international community need\r\nto work on in the spirit of partnership and shared\r\nresponsibility.\r\nIt is estimated in the New Agenda that a minimum\r\nof $30 billion in official development assistance was\r\nrequired in 1992 to achieve an average annual growth rate\r\nof real gross national product of at least 6 per cent in\r\nAfrican countries over the course of the 1990s. And after\r\nthat year, official development assistance would need to\r\ngrow at an average rate of 4 per cent per annum. The\r\nmid-term review has revealed that official development\r\nassistance stood at $26.4 billion in 1995. External\r\nindebtedness rose from $300 billion in 1991 to $322\r\nbillion in 1995.\r\nWe note with serious concern that the African share\r\nof world trade has declined during the period under\r\nreview to 2.2 per cent. This is despite the preferential\r\naccess to major world markets which African products\r\nhave. In addition, the impact on the African countries of\r\nthe outcome of the Uruguay Round agreement on\r\nmultilateral trade is not fully clear. It is recognized,\r\nthough, that the least developed countries and the non-\r\nfood-importing developing countries — in particular those\r\nin Africa — may experience transitional costs arising\r\nfrom the loss of preferences in the European Community.\r\nThe diversification of African economies remains an\r\nimportant element in the New Agenda. Most African\r\neconomies rely on a few primary commodities for much\r\nof their export earnings. These are adversely affected by\r\nfluctuations in the demand and prices of the primary\r\ncommodities.\r\nMost African Governments have embraced their\r\nshare of responsibility in the New Agenda. It is noted that\r\nin the two major areas of macroeconomic reform and\r\ngood governance, considerable progress has been attained\r\nby a number of countries. The liberalization of domestic\r\nprices and external trade, coupled with improvements in\r\nfinance management through improved methods of\r\naccounting have, among other things, resulted in a drop\r\nin the number of countries that experienced negative\r\ngrowth from 19 in 1992 to four in 1995.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report points out, though,\r\nthat human resources in many African countries remain\r\ninadequately developed, as is evident from the limited\r\naccess of the population to education at all levels and to\r\nhealth care and other social services. High levels of\r\nunemployment and underemployment, particularly among\r\nthe youth and women, are the other indicators.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nMy delegation therefore welcomes the\r\nrecommendations for enhancing the implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda as outlined by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport as well as those contained in the report of the Ad\r\nHoc Committee for the Mid-term Review. The mobilization\r\nof substantial new resources from all sources — public and\r\nprivate, traditional as well as new — is essential. While the\r\nNaples terms adopted by the Paris Club represent an\r\nimportant step in the evolution of an international debt\r\nstrategy, we call upon the donor community to institute far-\r\nreaching measures, which go beyond the 67 per cent debt-\r\nstock reduction, towards a durable solution of the debt\r\nproblem. There is a need to increase foreign direct\r\ninvestment flows to supplement the availability of resources\r\nfor economic development in Africa. The developed\r\ncountries should fulfil the agreed level of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national product for official development assistance.\r\nIn my country, Malawi, a critical range of policy\r\ninitiatives have been embarked upon to ensure compliance\r\nwith the major pillars of the Agenda. Important among\r\nthese are good governance and adherence to structural\r\nreforms as agreed with the Bretton Woods institutions. As\r\nregards good governance, Malawi’s first democratically\r\nelected Government took power in 1994 on the premise of\r\nempowerment of the people, justice for all and respect for\r\nhuman rights. In the realm of structural reforms to the\r\neconomy, which have resulted in some recovery in\r\neconomic activity, with real gross domestic product growth\r\naveraging some 10 per cent in 1995 and 1996, the\r\nGovernment has also been steadfast. The reforms have\r\nincluded the liberalization of crop production and\r\nmarketing. Happily, to a large extent, the major\r\nbeneficiaries have been small farmers.\r\nFurther, inflation has decelerated sharply, from 98 per\r\ncent in 1995 to less than 30 per cent by the end of 1996.\r\nIndeed, cumulative inflation in the first months of 1996\r\nsuggests that a further drop is more than likely to be\r\nachieved in 1997. This development is very important\r\nbecause inflation affects hardest those with low incomes.\r\nTherefore, the sharp decline in inflation not only helped to\r\nestablish a more stable environment for economic activity,\r\nbut also contributed to the Government’s efforts to alleviate\r\npoverty.\r\nMalawi has seen significant progress toward improving\r\nthe living conditions of the ordinary citizen, as evidenced\r\nby the many policy initiatives adopted in the past two\r\nyears, including the reform of the agricultural system which\r\nhas improved life in the rural areas. In addition, these\r\nefforts have benefited from assistance from international\r\nagencies and donors, including the specialized agencies of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIt is accepted, however, that the economic situation\r\nremains fragile in Malawi. Continued fiscal discipline and\r\na deepening of structural reforms are necessary to\r\nconsolidate the gains achieved thus far and to make\r\nfurther progress. Increased international support will\r\ntherefore continue to be needed for us to continue on this\r\ntrend. As my Minister of Foreign Affairs informed the\r\nAssembly in his statement of 9 October 1996, in his\r\nremarks on UN-NADAF,\r\n“It is sad to note that the financial resources required\r\nfor the programme have not matched the enthusiasm\r\nthat revolved around the launching of the New\r\nAgenda. My delegation sincerely hopes that the mid-\r\nterm review of the Agenda, which has just\r\nconcluded, will reignite the enthusiasm of us all and\r\nenhance the political will of all the cooperating\r\npartners.” (Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nFifty-first Session, Plenary Meetings, 28th meeting,\r\np. 5)\r\nI wish, once again, to underscore this view.\r\nWe wish to reiterate the view that for the success of\r\nUN-NADAF, all of us need to rededicate ourselves and\r\nour commitment to the programme. While African\r\ncountries are doing all they can, donor countries too need\r\nto support those efforts meaningfully with increased\r\nresources.\r\nFinally, we wish to thank the Chairman of the Ad\r\nHoc Committee, Ambassador Owada of Japan, whose\r\ntypically Japanese application to practical ideas is\r\nbeginning to filter through to development projects in\r\nAfrica. We consider his work to have been one of the\r\ngreat contributions made this year to the mid-term review\r\nof the New Agenda.\r\nMr. Ayewah (Nigeria): My delegation is pleased to\r\nparticipate in the general debate on agenda item 44\r\nentitled “Implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s”. We\r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made yesterday by\r\nthe representative of Cameroon in his capacity as\r\nrepresentative of the current Chairman of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) on behalf of the African Group.\r\nMy delegation also fully supports the statement made on\r\nthis agenda item by the representative of Costa Rica on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nIn acknowledging the work of the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nof the General Assembly pursuant to resolution 50/160, and\r\nin the context of the conduct of the mid-term review of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), we\r\nwant to congratulate and thank Ambassador Hisashi Owada,\r\nPermanent Representative of Japan and Chairman of the Ad\r\nHoc Committee, for his personal exertions during the\r\nreview. We would also like to thank the Vice-Chairmen\r\nwho presided over the working groups for their diligence in\r\nguiding us through the mid-term review.\r\nThe New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, which was born out of a desire to assist Africa in\r\novercoming its difficulties of economic underdevelopment,\r\nis founded on the principle of cooperation and shared\r\nresponsibility between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity. The Agenda provides for specific goals and\r\ntargets to be implemented within the programme period\r\nfrom 1991 to the year 2001. UN-NADAF should therefore\r\nbe seen as a framework of consensus and partnership\r\nbetween Africa and the international community aimed at\r\nstimulating initiatives towards Africa’s socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. Towards this end the New Agenda, which\r\nbuilt on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment (1986-1990), set out in definitive terms a\r\nglobal compact of intent between Africa and the United\r\nNations system on the one hand and between Africa and the\r\ninternational community on the other.\r\nIn particular, the developed countries and the donor\r\ncommunity were to support and assist Africa’s efforts in\r\nimplementing the Agenda with a view to accelerating the\r\neconomic growth of African countries. In our view, and as\r\nis clearly evident, the envisaged objectives of the Agenda\r\nare yet to be achieved minimally — even five years after\r\nadopting the New Agenda in 1991 — owing to lack of\r\npolitical will by the international community. I must hasten\r\nto add here that the international community goes beyond\r\nWestern Europe and the donor community to include other\r\nregions of the world, the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nnon-governmental organizations. The experience of the mid-\r\nterm review was a painful reminder that this fact was not\r\nfully recognized or accepted by all concerned.\r\nMindful of the fact that Africa’s socio-economic\r\ndevelopment is, in the first instance, a primary\r\nresponsibility of Africans themselves, many African\r\ncountries — including my own country — Nigeria, have\r\ncontinued since the mid-1980s to pursue and implement\r\neconomic reform measures in the context of structural\r\nadjustment programmes (SAPs) with their implied social\r\nhardships for the citizenry. Despite their commitment to\r\nsustained economic reforms, African countries’\r\nexperiences have been far from pleasant in terms of\r\neconomic growth because of the increasing trend towards\r\nglobalization of the world economy, the unfavourable\r\nexternal environment, poor access to the external market,\r\ndeclining returns on their commodities, and the\r\nunpredictability of the financial system.\r\nAfrica on its own has put a lot of store on the\r\nimportance and continuing validity of economic\r\nintegration within the framework of South-South\r\ncooperation. In this context, and as envisioned in the\r\nAbuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic\r\nCommunity which entered into force in May 1994,\r\nAfrican countries remain committed to the idea of\r\nsubregional and regional economic cooperation as the\r\ndefining pillars of economic emancipation and growth of\r\nthe African continent. Consequently, this has led to the\r\nformation of the Economic Community of Central African\r\nStates (ECCAS), the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\n(COMESA), the Southern Africa Development\r\nCommunity (SADC), the East African Community (EAC)\r\nand, in my own subregion, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS). We believe that the\r\ncreation of these entities will promote our regional and\r\nsubregional integration and lead to the transformation of\r\nthe African economies.\r\nIn March 1995, in a further effort to meet the\r\nchallenges of development in the continent, the African\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs adopted the Cairo Agenda\r\nfor Action, which recognized the elements of democracy,\r\ngood governance, peace and stability, security and social\r\njustice as necessary ingredients for socio-economic\r\ngrowth and sustainable development.\r\nIt is true that Africa’s economy is essentially\r\nmonocultural and agrarian, and for this reason many\r\ncountries depend on primary commodities for their export\r\nearnings and the survival of their teeming populations.\r\nConfronted with the fluctuation of commodity prices in\r\nthe world market, and with an external debt burden\r\ncurrently estimated at well over US $322 billion, the\r\nservicing of which consumes over 30 per cent of the\r\ncontinent’s export earnings, Africa’s capacity to undertake\r\nmeaningful development is seriously undermined. By the\r\nsame token, the continent is confronted with the\r\nchallenges of infrastructural and institutional capacity-\r\nbuilding, human resources development and the promotion\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nof science and technology for agricultural and industrial\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThese are issues of demand and supply economics that\r\ncan only be sustained by an interplay of domestic capacity\r\nand external input. In this connection, and in order to\r\nenable African countries to achieve their development\r\ngoals, there is an urgent need for the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the developed countries, to\r\nrespond concretely, in the spirit of cooperation and a New\r\nPartnership for Development, to Africa’s mobilization for\r\ndevelopment. Our development partners should see their\r\nway clear to support and be seen to be involved in the\r\nquest to diversify African economies through the\r\nestablishment of a diversification fund and the mobilization\r\nof new and additional resources to assist in fulfilling the\r\nintent of the New Agenda.\r\nAlthough African countries in general, in the wake of\r\nthe evolving trend towards globalization of the world\r\neconomy, have introduced innovative and encouraging\r\nmeasures in order to promote investment opportunities, we\r\nnote with disappointment the decline in the inflow of\r\nresources to the continent, not only of official development\r\nassistance but also of foreign direct investment.\r\nDuring the mid-term review of the New Agenda, a\r\nsignificant impression was conveyed and registered, namely\r\nthat there was a lack of awareness of the programme.\r\nBesides, a negative attitude on the part of the international\r\ncommunity has continued to persist to the effect that Africa\r\nhas an unfavourable economic and investment potential.\r\nThe point must be made here that such an attitude is not\r\nonly dysfunctional and inaccurate but clearly negates the\r\nprinciple of cooperation, shared responsibility and\r\npartnership in development. In this connection, there is a\r\nneed for the international community to recognize Africa’s\r\nenormous investment potential and highly profitable and\r\nfavourable returns on investments. It is a continent which\r\nis replete with natural and human resources but needs the\r\nassistance and support of the international community in\r\norder to maximize the advantages in its march towards\r\neconomic growth and sustained development. We encourage\r\nthe international media to be constructive in their reporting\r\nand to move away from subjective and tendentious\r\nreporting, which delights in highlighting only the negative\r\naspects of Africa’s investment profile and environment\r\nwhile playing down the positive aspects. Here the\r\nDepartment of Public Information of the United Nations\r\nSecretariat has a leading role to play and we encourage it\r\nto play that role.\r\nIn view of Africa’s marginalization in world trade\r\nand considering its obvious disadvantages, particularly in\r\nthe short and medium terms, following the recently\r\nconcluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations and the Marrakesh agreements, we call on\r\nthe international community, and in particular the\r\ndeveloped countries, to ensure that implementation of the\r\nFinal Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with\r\nspecial treatment with regard to the establishment of\r\ncompensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein, as well\r\nas in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization.\r\nAfrican countries recognize the need to promote\r\neconomic cooperation with the developing countries in\r\nother regions in the context of South-South cooperation.\r\nWe see the initiative of South-South cooperation as\r\nessential in the growing interdependence of economies.\r\nAfrica recognizes the tremendous development effort that\r\nhas been made by other developing regions, especially in\r\nAsia. We believe that shared experience between Asia and\r\nAfrica can also enhance Africa’s endeavour in the\r\nrealization of the perspectives of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nestablishment of the Africa-Asia Forum and urge it to act\r\nas a useful component in constructive dialogue for\r\ndevelopment and in implementation of UN-NADAF.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation participated in the mid-term\r\nreview of the implementation of UN-NADAF which took\r\nplace here in New York from 16 to 20 September 1996,\r\nand we know that UN-NADAF had a poor record of\r\nimplementation. This ought not to be. UN-NADAF was\r\na voluntary global compact of intent and commitment on\r\nthe part of Africa, the United Nations system and the\r\ninternational community to help Africa to escape from its\r\nsocio-economic difficulties. It is only right that we should\r\nall deliver on our various commitments. Africa is by no\r\nmeans suggesting that the international community owes\r\nit a living. Primary responsibility for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment remains African. Africa must, therefore, not\r\nbe prevented nor disabled from assuming that\r\nresponsibility in the interest of its people. Africa is of\r\ncourse grateful to those countries that, in spite of their\r\ndomestic difficulties and the need to pander or answer to\r\nthe sensitivities of their parliaments or electorates, have\r\nmanaged to provide some assistance in the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF. But Africa is not a\r\ncharity case in which the donor-recipient syndrome can be\r\nallowed to perpetuate itself. UN-NADAF has five years\r\nto go. It is appropriate at this fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in the wake of the mid-term review of\r\nUN-NADAF, that there is a political message of renewal\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nof momentum and enthusiasm and — more importantly —\r\nof commitment to implement the Agenda, in the interest of\r\nthe credibility of our Organization and the common\r\nhumanity we all share.\r\nMr. Hahm (Republic of Korea): In this post-cold-war\r\nera of economic globalization and interdependence, the\r\nissue of development has gained increasing prominence. A\r\nnew environment has emerged in which the challenge of\r\ndevelopment can best be met by a global partnership\r\nbetween developed and developing countries. The Korean\r\ndelegation therefore believes that the current mid-term\r\nreview of the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF), one of the cornerstones of this new\r\npartnership, is both timely and important.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of\r\nthe Whole for the mid-term review of the implementation\r\nof UN-NADAF as highly comprehensive and constructive,\r\nand believe that it can serve as an excellent basis for our\r\ndeliberations on this issue. In this respect, the Korean\r\ndelegation wishes to commend the work of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole, conducted under the able\r\nleadership of Ambassador Hisashi Owada of Japan. The\r\nKorean delegation fully endorses the various\r\nrecommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee contained in\r\ndocument A/51/48. We would like to emphasize, however,\r\ncertain points to which the Korean Government attaches\r\nspecial importance.\r\nFirst of all, we believe that what is needed now for the\r\ncause of development in Africa is the translation of\r\ncommitments into action. Since the adoption of\r\nUN-NADAF in 1991, we have witnessed a growing\r\nawareness and recognition of Africa’s particular\r\ndevelopment needs, as evidenced by a series of encouraging\r\nrecent events. The programmes of action of each of the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences in the 1990s have given\r\nnew priority to the development of the African continent.\r\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment-Development Assistance Committee report of\r\nMay this year, entitled “Shaping the Twenty-First Century”,\r\nset out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames,\r\nand the June 1996 economic communiqué of the Lyon\r\nSummit of the Group of Seven major industrialized\r\ncountries called for a new partnership between developed\r\nand developing countries.\r\nAfrican countries, for their part, have made substantial\r\nimprovements in their overall economic performance. The\r\nnumber of African countries to achieve the target 6 per\r\ncent annual growth of gross domestic product increased\r\nfrom three in 1992 to 12 in 1995, while the number of\r\ncountries with negative growth rates dropped from 19 in\r\n1992 to three in 1995.\r\nMany African countries have also engaged in\r\ninstitutional reform aimed at democratization and\r\neconomic liberalization.\r\nIn the light of these positive developments on the\r\npart of both developed and developing countries, we\r\nbelieve that the time is ripe for the international\r\ncommunity to do all it possibly can to promote the\r\ndevelopment of the African continent. My delegation\r\nhopes that the recommendations of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee for the mid-term review of UN-NADAF,\r\nformulated on the basis of the specific needs of African\r\ncountries, will be put into action without delay and will\r\nenjoy the full support of the international community.\r\nSecondly, we would like to emphasize that the\r\nUnited Nations system should play a greater role in\r\nachieving the goals of the New Agenda. All United\r\nNations organizations and specialized agencies should\r\nincorporate the goals of UN-NADAF into the formulation\r\nand implementation of their programmes and projects, and\r\nbetter fund and coordinate their programmes that\r\ncomplement the goals of the New Agenda.\r\nIn this respect the Korean delegation welcomes and\r\nfully supports the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative on Africa, launched in March 1996, which\r\nshould aim to provide practical proposals that reinforce\r\nthe New Agenda. The initiative is all the more meaningful\r\nbecause of the active participation of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. We believe that the Special Initiative provides\r\nnew momentum towards achieving the goals of\r\nUN-NADAF and should be an important practical step\r\ntowards a more efficient implementation of the various\r\nprogrammes of action for Africa.\r\nThirdly, my delegation wishes to underline the\r\nimportance of South-South cooperation, which is clearly\r\nindispensable to the successful implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda. It is our country’s sincere belief that South-\r\nSouth cooperation can provide a vital head start and\r\nlasting succour on the road to development. South-South\r\ncooperation, however, must be pursued not only\r\nbilaterally, but also in a multilateral context. The role of\r\ninternational organizations such as the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development and the United\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization should be\r\nstrengthened in this regard. Assistance from donor countries\r\nthrough multilateral organs is also an important part of this\r\neffort.\r\nFourthly, international cooperation should focus on\r\npriority needs, targeting the most pressing needs of the\r\nAfrican people, and taking into account the fact that\r\ndevelopment resources are limited. In this regard, the\r\nKorean delegation believes that several issues deserve\r\nparticular attention, namely public health, ensuring sanitary\r\ndrinking water, agricultural development, the expansion of\r\neducation for children and job training for city dwellers.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has provided and will continue\r\nto provide various forms of assistance to African countries\r\nand to other developing countries. The Korea International\r\nCooperation Agency (KOICA) has extended technological\r\nassistance and sought to share with developing countries the\r\nexperience accumulated in the course of our own economic\r\ndevelopment. African countries were recently made the\r\npriority recipients of KOICA’s technological and human\r\nresources assistance programmes.\r\nIn addition to that, the Korea-Economic Commission\r\nfor Africa Cooperation Fund, established last year, has been\r\nincreased by 50 per cent in 1996. We have also decided to\r\nreplenish the Korea Consultant Trust Fund in the World\r\nBank, which also aims at sharing Korea’s experience and\r\nknow-how with other developing countries. Korea stands\r\nready, commensurate with its economic capabilities, to\r\nmake even greater contributions to the development of\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nFinally, the Korean delegation believes that Africa’s\r\nwealth of human and natural resources endow it with\r\nenormous potential, and that it is the urgent duty of the\r\ninternational community to help the people of Africa\r\ntranslate that potential into reality as soon as they possibly\r\ncan.\r\nWe hope that our deliberations under this agenda item\r\nwill help to identify the best feasible method and means of\r\nachieving the goals of UN-NADAF and reinforcing the\r\ncommitment of the international community to the cause of\r\nAfrican development.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the delegation of Jamaica on agenda item 44,\r\nentitled “Implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.” My\r\ndelegation wishes to associate itself with the statement\r\nmade earlier by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of\r\nthe Whole of the General Assembly for the Mid-term\r\nReview of the Implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF), and wish to thank its Chairman, His\r\nExcellency Hisashi Owada, Permanent Representative of\r\nJapan, and the members of the Bureau for their leadership\r\nroles in guiding the work of the Ad Hoc Committee.\r\nThe mid-term review allowed for a critical\r\nexamination of the progress made in the implementation\r\nof the New Agenda. It also reaffirmed and underscored\r\nthe mutuality of commitments and responsibilities and the\r\nneed for the countries of Africa and the members of the\r\ninternational community to take action. The review also\r\nexamined critical development issues affecting the\r\nimplementation of the Agenda and recommended\r\nmeasures to accelerate its implementation in order to\r\nfoster sustained economic growth and sustained\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nAfrica and its resources, notably its human\r\nresources, are of enormous potential; and the mid-term\r\nreview afforded the opportunity for renewed commitment\r\nto the social and economic agenda of the continent.\r\nMost African countries have, for their part,\r\nconsistently taken appropriate actions to promote\r\ndevelopment, including instituting political and economic\r\nreforms. Actions taken by African countries have been\r\naimed at achieving real and sustainable economic growth\r\nthrough, inter alia, the improvement of public finance and\r\nmanagement methods, and the enhancement of efficiency\r\nand transparency in tax systems. We note that in almost\r\nall countries, reform measures have been taken and\r\ncontinue to be pursued in order to liberalize domestic\r\nprices and external trade. We must recognize the efforts\r\nof some 35 countries to make monetary adjustments and\r\nof some 21 to improve public finance management.\r\nRegional and subregional economic cooperation and\r\nintegration are other positive actions, with initiatives\r\ncurrently under way in northern, eastern and southern\r\nAfrica. Other areas of focus include the stepping up of\r\ndemocratization; investment promotion; population and\r\ndevelopment; agriculture and food security, and South-\r\nSouth cooperation.\r\nAs a developing country, Jamaica, like its African\r\ncounterparts, recognizes the value of these initiatives and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nthe value of South-South cooperation as a vehicle for\r\nadvancement in critical areas such as transfer of technology,\r\ntraining, joint ventures, trade and investment, education and\r\nthe eradication of poverty.\r\nJamaica has over the years expressed its solidarity\r\nwith the African people, a solidarity that is born of a\r\nhistory of cordial and friendly relations with countries on\r\nthe African continent. We took a strong stand in the fight\r\nagainst apartheid and rejoiced with Africa when that system\r\nsaw its demise. We recall that in the 1950s, even while still\r\na colony, Jamaica followed the lead of India and instituted\r\na trade boycott against South Africa.\r\nAs a country that has suffered under the heavy burden\r\nof external debt and the ensuing social and economic\r\nhardships resulting from structural adjustment, Jamaica is\r\nfully aware of the difficulties currently being confronted by\r\nour sister nations on the African continent. Africa’s external\r\ndebt is now widely acknowledged to be unsustainable, and\r\nwe must support the search for durable solutions. We note,\r\nfor example, that African debt has risen from $289 billion\r\nin 1991 to over $314 billion by 1995. It is clear that\r\nsomething must be done.\r\nIn order to achieve the major objectives of the New\r\nAgenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent, the\r\ninternational community must accelerate its support to\r\nAfrican countries in order to sustain the momentum leading\r\nto recovery and sustainable development in areas such as\r\nthe further alleviation of the burden of external debt, the\r\nattraction of foreign private investment, increased official\r\ndevelopment assistance, trade facilitation and market access,\r\nand development assistance for capacity-building.\r\nUN-NADAF calls for a full partnership between\r\nAfrica and the international community. There is indeed a\r\nstrong case for increasing the volume and concessionality\r\nof development assistance to Africa. There is a need to\r\nfurther enhance and improve the quality of international\r\nsupport to Africa’s efforts in the 1990s.\r\nMeasures that should be considered include\r\nrechannelling aid to Africa’s key development priorities;\r\nallocating resources to conflict prevention and\r\nreconstruction in post-conflict countries; and switching to\r\nnon-debt-creating assistance.\r\nAfrica’s efforts to address conflict prevention and\r\nresolution and post-conflict reconstruction should be\r\nincorporated into a more comprehensive and coordinated\r\napproach with the support of the relevant actors, including\r\nthe United Nations, bilateral and multilateral donors. We\r\nrecognize the need to strengthen the Mechanism for the\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of Conflicts and\r\nearly warning capacities of the Organization of African\r\nUnity.\r\nThe success of the New Agenda lies in effective\r\nfollow-up and monitoring at the global, regional and\r\nnational levels. The United Nations system has a critical\r\nrole to play in ensuring that this becomes a reality. The\r\nAgenda needs to be continuously promoted by the\r\nrelevant United Nations institutions in the context of clear\r\nmandates and policy directions. Concrete ways must be\r\nfound to advance the cause of African development and\r\nto ensure that implementation becomes a reality. While\r\nthere has been progress in human, institutional and private\r\nsector development, success is contingent upon both the\r\ncontinued political will of African countries and the\r\ncommitment of the international community.\r\nWe are aware of the challenges as the African\r\ncontinent faces another five years of the New Agenda.\r\nOne major challenge will be to marshal the massive sums\r\nneeded to effectively implement the New Agenda. If\r\nAfrica is to regain economic viability in the run-up to the\r\nnew millennium, full and tangible support will be needed.\r\nInternational efforts will have to be channelled to focus\r\non the well-articulated priorities of the African countries.\r\nTheir own efforts at preventing and resolving conflicts\r\nwill need to be further supplemented.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica remains fully committed\r\nto supporting the efforts being undertaken to implement\r\nthe New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s in the hope that this will contribute to the long-\r\nterm development of our sister countries on the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\nrepresentative of Cuba has requested to participate in the\r\ndebate on this item. Bearing in mind that the list of\r\nspeakers was closed yesterday at 5 p.m., I should like to\r\npropose, if there is no objection, that this delegation be\r\nincluded on the list of speakers.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Awaad (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of Egypt, I should like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on the mid-term\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nreview of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nThough the report truly reflects what has been\r\nachieved by the African States and the international\r\ncommunity with regard to the implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, it does not give a clear picture of the economic and\r\nsocial realities on the continent.\r\nI should like to thank Ambassador Owada, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Japan, for his work as\r\nChairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole for the\r\nmid-term review, which met last September.\r\nDuring the mid-term review of the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), we agreed that the\r\nsituation remained critical and we must step up our efforts\r\nfor the development of the continent. We must work\r\ntogether at the national and international levels. We believe\r\nthat responsibility for economic and social development lies\r\nprimarily with the African States themselves. Africa will\r\ndevelop thanks to its peoples. Success will depend also on\r\nsupport for and the sustainability of those efforts.\r\nWith a view to supporting the work done by African\r\nGovernments in recent years, we draw attention to the\r\ndifficult circumstances accompanying the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF. Over the last few years and, indeed, right up\r\nto today there have been problems of refugees and conflict.\r\nThere has also been an unfavourable economic climate in\r\nrespect of the terms of trade and the foreign debt burden,\r\nand a drop in official development assistance. Despite that,\r\nAfrican countries have taken major measures at the national\r\nlevel as a basis for consolidating democracy. They have\r\nalso undertaken economic recovery and structural\r\nadjustment programmes. In the past 10 years, some\r\nencouraging figures have emerged, along with a more\r\nfavourable climate for domestic and foreign investment.\r\nMoreover, the Abuja Declaration is now taking effect.\r\nIn 1995 African Heads of State or Government\r\nadopted the Cairo Agenda for Action on revitalizing\r\neconomic and social recovery in Africa. Africa has thus\r\nassumed an enormous responsibility for dealing with\r\nquestions of security and stability within the continent,\r\nbecause those issues are so closely related to development.\r\nThey have also established the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution.\r\nDuring the mid-term review we said it was necessary\r\nto increase the volume of assistance given by the\r\ninternational community to African countries, particularly\r\nthe least developed. We also said it was essential to target\r\nthat assistance in accordance with national priorities. This\r\nrequires a flexible approach, given the nature of existing\r\nproblems, and means that the surrounding environment\r\nhas to be taken into account.\r\nIn estimating the required resources, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said that despite the efforts made by African\r\nStates to improve their use of official development\r\nassistance, and despite efforts made by developed\r\ncountries to help developing countries, since the early\r\n1990s there has been a significant drop in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, to $20 billion, rather than the\r\nrecommended $30 billion with an increase of 4 per cent\r\nyearly.\r\nFour years after the adoption of the New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa, targets for mobilizing\r\nresources for development have been only partially met,\r\ndespite efforts by the countries themselves to implement\r\neconomic and social reform measures.\r\nWhile some progress has been made in Africa in the\r\nlast five years, this was due primarily to efforts made at\r\nthe national level in African countries. Assistance by the\r\ninternational community has been below what is needed\r\nto support development in Africa, and has not been\r\nconsonant with the goals set by the General Assembly, by\r\nconsensus. Despite all this, during the mid-term review\r\nlast September the African community took a very\r\npositive approach. They did not attempt to blame\r\nanybody; rather they tried to look to the future, seeking\r\nways and means of encouraging cooperation between\r\nAfrica and the international community.\r\nWe believe that the African countries themselves are\r\nprimarily responsible for their own development. They\r\nwill have to use their own resources, but the unfavourable\r\neconomic environment surrounding Africa, budgetary\r\nconstraints and the reluctance of developed countries to\r\nhelp Africa are all obstacles to the financing and\r\ndevelopment of Africa.\r\nMost African States will be unable to implement the\r\neconomic reforms which are essential to development\r\nunless more financial resources are made available both\r\ninternally and externally. We have to avoid failure like\r\nthat encountered earlier in respect of the United Nations\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment 1986-1990.\r\nIt is essential that the international community make\r\na collective endeavour to support the sincere efforts being\r\nmade by African States. If we really wish to sustain the\r\ndevelopment of Africa we must move from words to action\r\nso that Africa can emerge from the vicious cycle of poverty\r\nand underdevelopment and develop at this most important\r\ncrossroads on the path to the new millennium.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): The delegation of Zambia\r\nwould like to share its perspective on this important agenda\r\nitem: the United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). We are grateful to\r\nthe Secretariat for the reports of the Secretary-General on\r\nthis item. Our appreciation also goes to Ambassador Owada\r\nof Japan, who successfully presided over the mid-term\r\nreview of UN-NADAF.\r\nWe would like from the outset to reaffirm our support\r\nfor the goals and objectives set in UN-NADAF and, indeed,\r\nthe outcome of the mid-term review. We should collectively\r\npursue them with a spirit of partnership, because they\r\nremain valid and vital to the sustainable development of\r\nAfrica.\r\nAfrica is still the region most in need of development\r\nassistance. This is likely to be the case for many years to\r\ncome, given the high incidence of poverty in the region.\r\nIn the first five years of UN-NADAF, Africa has\r\nexperienced marginalization. Africa’s share of world trade,\r\nfor example, has declined steadily, from 5 per cent in 1990\r\nto 2.3 per cent in 1995. The results of the Uruguay Round\r\nare not expected to be positive for our continent, and my\r\ndelegation hopes that terms of compensation will be\r\nspecified for net losers in the Uruguay Round, as agreed at\r\nMarrakesh. Also regarding resource flows, net official\r\ndevelopment assistance declined from $25 billion in 1992\r\nto $21.5 billion in 1995.\r\nExternal debt, estimated at $270 billion in 1990,\r\nreached $322 billion in 1995. Unless major debt reductions\r\nare achieved by the close of UN-NADAF, external debt\r\nwill continue to undermine Africa’s development.\r\nAfrican countries have accomplished a great deal in\r\nthe last five years in terms of economic policy adjustments\r\nin order to realize the goals set in UN-NADAF. Despite the\r\nmany efforts that most African countries have been making\r\nto ensure economic recovery and sustained, accelerated\r\neconomic growth, external factors such as the ones I have\r\njust cited have continued to hold back any significant\r\nprogress.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General rightly notes the\r\nmajor steps African countries have taken to promote the\r\nregion’s development during the past five years. At the\r\nregional level, the most notable development has been the\r\nsigning on 3 June 1991 of the Treaty establishing the\r\nAfrican Economic Community. This development is of\r\ngreat significance, because, among other things, it will\r\nassist in the harmonization of economic policies within\r\nthe region. Continent-wide, this economic cooperation and\r\nintegration is expected to lead to expanded trade among\r\nthe African countries.\r\nWe have hope in the success of the African\r\nEconomic Community, because it is being built on strong\r\nfoundations established at subregional levels. In southern\r\nAfrica, for example, we transformed our Southern African\r\nDevelopment Coordination Conference (SADCC), into an\r\norganization devoted to promoting deeper economic\r\nintegration and renamed it the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC). The harmonization of\r\neconomic policies and the greater understanding being\r\nestablished at the subregional level can only facilitate the\r\nrealization of our aspirations for a strong and effective\r\nAfrican Economic Community.\r\nSADC is not the only example. We also created the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\n(COMESA), which replaced the Preferential Trade Area\r\n(PTA). Other subregions in Africa have similar\r\narrangements. As we move ahead with the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF, the challenge of African\r\npolicy-making will be to harmonize these arrangements\r\nand pave the way for a consolidated African Economic\r\nCommunity by the year 2020.\r\nAt the national level, Zambia has been pursuing an\r\nactive economic recovery programme. The centrepiece of\r\nour policies has been the liberalization of the economy,\r\nshifting it away from a situation in which the State is the\r\nmajor player and towards one that is driven by the private\r\nsector. In this context, we have put in place monetary and\r\nfiscal policies conducive to both local and foreign\r\ninvestment. We are also privatizing certain aspects of\r\npublic organizations.\r\nIn order to improve our revenue collection system,\r\nan autonomous revenue collection body was created and\r\nhas been operating efficiently.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nDespite these efforts, Zambia will not be able to\r\nrealize the goals of UN-NADAF without the continued\r\nassistance of the international community. We still need\r\nofficial development assistance, and foreign direct\r\ninvestment in our economy is very much required.\r\nI should like to end my statement with a few\r\ncomments specific to implementation. First, we are\r\nconcerned that there is a lack of clarity on how the United\r\nNations is going to pursue the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF and the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative for Africa. We recognize, of course, that the two\r\nare complementary. In our view, however, it is neither\r\ncorrect nor helpful to consider UN-NADAF as a mere\r\nadvocacy statement on the development problems and\r\nchallenges our region is facing, and the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative as an operational and more\r\nactive agenda, and hence more deserving of donor support.\r\nIn our view, complementarity is needed at both the\r\nadvocacy and operational levels, as the two elements are\r\ncharacteristic of both programmes. The way forward, we\r\nbelieve, is synchronization.\r\nWe would like to encourage the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations\r\nOffice of the Special Coordinator for Africa and the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries (OSCAL) to continue to work in a\r\ncoordinated manner, in consultation with all stakeholders,\r\non determining how to better achieve this, taking into\r\nconsideration in particular the results of the mid-term\r\nreview.\r\nBeyond this, we call for a strengthened OSCAL. The\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa should not be kept\r\nmarginal to such a process. A strong coordination link\r\nwithin the United Nations system is of vital importance to\r\nthe full and effective implementation of UN-NADAF.\r\nFinally, we appeal to the donor community and to the\r\ninternational financial institutions to continue their support\r\nfor UN-NADAF as well as for the United Nations System-\r\nwide Special Initiative for Africa.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): It is an honour and a pleasure for us to\r\naddress the Assembly once again in order to share our\r\nviews on a very important subject.\r\nAt the outset, the delegation of Viet Nam wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statements made by the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China, and by the representatives of other Member\r\nStates, on the major challenges and difficulties facing the\r\nAfrican continent and on the efforts made over the past\r\nfive years by the African countries and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, including our Organization and its\r\nagencies, to implement the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nI take this opportunity also to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General on his detailed report (A/51/228 and\r\nAdd.1) containing relevant recommendations. We are\r\ngrateful also for the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of\r\nthe Whole of the General Assembly for the Mid-term\r\nReview of the Implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(A/51/48). The in-depth analysis of a number of essential\r\naspects of development in Africa relating to the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda, and the suggestions\r\ncontained in the reports could provide good matter for\r\nreflection and reference in our discussion here today as\r\nwe consider the mid-term review of the implementation\r\nof the Agenda.\r\nBy resolution 46/151, the General Assembly adopted\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, and called on the international\r\ncommunity to make a substantial contribution to the\r\neconomic recovery and development of the African\r\ncontinent. The Agenda reflects the commitment of\r\nAfrican countries and of the international community to\r\ncooperation towards the promotion of the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the continent. The essential goals of the\r\nNew Agenda are accelerated change, integration,\r\ndiversification and the growth of the African economies,\r\nwith a view to strengthening them as part of the global\r\neconomy to make them less vulnerable to external shocks\r\nand more dynamic, with a view to making the\r\ndevelopment process more endogenous and to increase the\r\nautonomy of African countries.\r\nLikewise, the interdependent global economy\r\ncontinues to be dominated by uncertainty, imbalances and\r\nrecession. Negative economic growth rates, persistent\r\nimbalances in the fields of trade and finance, an increase\r\nin situational and structural unemployment, and the\r\nabsence of coordination in exchange rates and trade\r\npolicies are problems related to the system of the\r\ndeveloped world which have a negative impact on\r\ndeveloping countries, including our brother countries in\r\nAfrica.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nSince then, many initiatives and efforts have been\r\nundertaken in the framework of our Organization to ensure\r\nbetter coordination in the implementation of the New\r\nAgenda. Theme conferences have been organized under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, and these have made the\r\ninternational community more aware that the African\r\ncontinent is urgently calling for international solidarity.\r\nWe must note that the economic and social situation\r\nof Africa today remains critical. The continent runs the risk\r\nof being marginalized in the global economy. Long-\r\nstanding difficulties have worsened the situation of\r\nunemployment, poverty and other social problems,\r\nincluding rapid population growth, ecological deterioration,\r\nmalnutrition and illiteracy; these have become sources of\r\ninstability and political conflict in the continent. No\r\nchallenge could be more crucial for the international\r\ncommunity today than the survival and the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of Africa.\r\nWe share the view expressed by several delegations\r\nthat the development of Africa undeniably depends first and\r\nforemost on the efforts and the struggle waged by the\r\nAfrican peoples themselves. Indeed, in these past five years,\r\nmany African countries have made enormous efforts and\r\nhave had a certain measure of success in the areas of\r\neconomic reform, modernization and agricultural and\r\nhuman resource development. As the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport rightly states, the number of countries showing\r\nnegative growth was only 4 in 1995 compared to 19 in\r\n1993. The number of countries reaching the goal of 6 per\r\ncent annual growth in gross domestic product went from 3\r\nin 1992 to 12 in 1995. These first achievements, while\r\nmodest, have shown that Africa is finally on the right track.\r\nIt is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and\r\nthe constraints imposed by the external economic\r\nenvironment, including a reduction in official development\r\nassistance, the heavy debt burden, deteriorating terms of\r\ntrade, and increased barriers impeding access to developed\r\ncountry markets have prevented any fundamental\r\nimprovement in the economic situation. The international\r\ncommunity must therefore adopt concrete measures so that\r\nAfrica may work towards revitalization. Developed\r\ncountries should first and foremost honour their\r\ncommitments under the New Agenda and other relevant\r\ninternational agreements related to the development of\r\nAfrica in order to reach sustainable solutions to the\r\nchallenges faced by the continent.\r\nAs our Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Excellency\r\nMr. Nguyen Manh Cam, stressed in his address to the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the general debate, international\r\ncooperation and in particular capital flows and\r\ntechnological transfers from developed countries to\r\nunderdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are\r\nnecessary and beneficial for the sustainable development\r\nof underdeveloped countries. Thus, foreign direct\r\ninvestment should play a larger role in the economic\r\ndevelopment of African countries because it can\r\ncontribute to expanding productive capacity and to\r\npromoting the transfer of sophisticated technologies and\r\nmanagerial skills without an increase in the foreign debt.\r\nMany African countries have adopted policies aimed at\r\nattracting foreign investment, but the response has been\r\nmodest.\r\nThe question of the foreign debt burden is closely\r\nrelated to sustainable growth, development and poverty\r\neradication. Low commodity prices and a crushing\r\nexternal debt are among the factors which account for the\r\ncontinent’s mediocre results at the economic level. Any\r\nserious attempt to deal with the question of sustainable\r\ngrowth and development and with the reduction of\r\npoverty must go hand in hand with measures to resolve\r\nonce and for all, and to cancel, the external debt of\r\nAfrican countries. The international community must\r\nformulate new radical bilateral and multilateral initiatives\r\nto resolve the debt problem of African countries.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to underscore\r\nthat as we advance towards the next millennium the\r\ninternational community must undertake concerted efforts\r\nto assist Africa in taking the necessary giant steps to join\r\nin the development process set forth in United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nWe hope that the mid-term review that we are discussing\r\ntoday will allow us to fulfil the commitments made by the\r\ninternational community to meet the development needs\r\nof this large part of humankind. Viet Nam continues to\r\nfollow closely the economic and political developments\r\nwhich have taken place in brother African countries over\r\nthe past few years and hopes that, based on their own\r\nefforts and on the support and assistance of the\r\ninternational community, Africa will achieve a more\r\ndynamic and sustainable pace of development.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): My delegation wishes to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for the reports prepared\r\nfor consideration by the General Assembly under the\r\npresent agenda item, “Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s”. Together with the report of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nMid-term Review of the Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, they represent a valuable basis for discussion and\r\nfuture action.\r\nSlovenia fully endorses the statement made yesterday\r\nby the Permanent Representative of Ireland, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union and associated States. Today we wish\r\nto add several points that are, we believe, relevant to the\r\ncurrent discussion.\r\nIt is generally agreed today that global development\r\ncannot be complete without an improvement in the situation\r\nin and the development of Africa. The priority character of\r\nefforts towards the development of Africa was recognized\r\nin a variety of ways at the recent series of global\r\nconferences and is addressed specifically in the documents\r\nrelated to the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda. It is generally agreed that, in addition to the efforts\r\nmade by the countries in the region, there is a need to\r\npromote full partnership for development. Aid is important,\r\nbut for sustainable development trade and investments are\r\nthe most important forms of cooperation.\r\nThere are some promising signs, and they should not\r\nbe overlooked. In the report of the Secretary-General dated\r\n6 August 1996 on the implementation of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda (A/51/228), we read that there has been some\r\nimprovement in the overall economic performance in\r\nAfrica. The number of countries recording negative growth\r\nrates has dropped, and the number of countries that\r\nachieved the targeted 6 per cent annual growth rate in their\r\ngross domestic product increased from 3 in 1992 to 12 in\r\n1995. This development must not be overlooked.\r\nFurthermore, as stated in a recent United Nations\r\nstudy on foreign direct investment and repeated in many\r\nsubsequent documents, the return on investment made in\r\nAfrica is substantially higher than in other developing\r\nregions, and even in most developed countries. This\r\nindicates the potential for increased investment flows as\r\neconomic reforms proceed and the investment climate\r\nimproves.\r\nHowever, the potential that exists requires effective\r\ninternational cooperation. The principles of full partnership\r\nand shared responsibility call for the international\r\ncommunity to provide adequate and assured support for the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. The level, scope and\r\nmodalities of cooperation should be improved. This would\r\ninclude channelling assistance to Africa’s development\r\npriorities and switching to non-debt-creating assistance.\r\nThe debt burden is among the main obstacles to the\r\nmore rapid development of Africa. The debt burden of\r\nsome $350 billion conditions the pace of development and\r\ninevitably affects all the efforts directed towards the\r\nstrengthening of economies in the region. It is therefore\r\nessential that action be taken. The agreement to act\r\nthrough new initiatives such as the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative is an important step in this\r\ncontext. Other steps need to follow. Progress in the efforts\r\nfor debt relief should be monitored and supported,\r\nparticularly since the experience with previous debt-relief\r\ninitiatives have not succeeded in reducing the level of\r\nindebtedness in Africa. We see that task also as an\r\nopportunity for the United Nations to establish a\r\nmeaningful and system-wide operation for the\r\nimplementation of the mid-term review.\r\nIn addition to economic, and in particular\r\nmacroeconomic, measures, it is important to devote the\r\nappropriate attention to social and political issues. The\r\ninherent linkages between economic and social aspects of\r\ndevelopment are generally recognized and have been\r\ngiven special importance in the documents of the World\r\nSummit on Social Development. The commitment to\r\nwork for the eradication of poverty is a clear expression\r\nof this.\r\nHowever, the implementation of this commitment in\r\nthe context of the complex economic and social realities\r\nof African countries is a particularly difficult task\r\nrequiring sustained effort. As shown recently in an\r\nevaluation of the implementation of the World Bank’s\r\noperational directive for the reduction of poverty — press\r\nreports on that evaluation were published less than a week\r\nago — it appears that the social aspects of adjustment and\r\npoverty reduction are not always adequately represented\r\nin country assistance strategies. This would suggest that\r\nadditional efforts will be necessary to develop sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive strategies of cooperation for development\r\nin Africa. Such strategies should include as central\r\nelements debt relief and support for direct investments.\r\nHowever, poverty reduction and the social aspects of\r\ndevelopment also will have to be included and should be\r\ngiven a higher priority than has been the case thus far.\r\nIn the case of Africa, additional consideration must\r\nbe given to the problem of refugees. Africa has the\r\nlargest concentration of refugees. Not only does this\r\nrepresent a huge burden for an impoverished continent,\r\nbut it is also a reminder that political and security issues\r\nhave to be included in the development equation for\r\nAfrica. The problem should be approached from two\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\ndirections simultaneously. There is an urgent need for the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council to devote as much\r\nattention as possible to the crisis situations in Africa, in\r\nparticular in the Great Lakes region. Long-term solutions\r\nshould be devised, and repatriation of refugees should be\r\nmade one of the basic priorities.\r\nOn the other hand, however, it would be inappropriate\r\nto perceive Africa’s political problems and military\r\nconflicts as unrelated to the underlying problems of\r\ndevelopment. The successful implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s would also represent a major contribution to political\r\nstability and to the prevention of conflicts in the region and\r\nof the resulting humanitarian problems. It is not an\r\nexaggeration, therefore, to say that the successful\r\nimplementation of the Agenda would represent an important\r\ncontribution not only to the African region but also to the\r\nredefinition of the United Nations and its transformation\r\ninto an effective instrument of social and political change.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe peoples of the world look to the United Nations to play\r\na very important role in the area of development throughout\r\nthe world. But development objectives have at times\r\nbecome dreams — dreams that do not come true. In their\r\nstead, there is death and destruction, caused by man\r\nhimself. War has become the major obstacle to\r\ndevelopment in all sectors. Many now believe that there can\r\nbe no development without peace and without joint and\r\nserious efforts to implement development programmes and\r\nplans.\r\nKuwait welcomes the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly in December 1991 of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF). This is the title of agenda item 44, which\r\nwe are considering today. The New Agenda is a concrete\r\nmanifestation of what is being done to achieve true\r\ndevelopment, which the international community hopes will\r\noccur. My delegation wishes to express its great\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his outstanding\r\nwork for the implementation of UN-NADAF. We should\r\nlike also to thank him for his comprehensive report on the\r\nitem, which is before us in document A/51/228.\r\nWe support the various conclusions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, especially the point that we must try to\r\nensure the success of UN-NADAF by giving proper\r\nattention to investment flows from the international\r\ncommunity to support the efforts of the African countries\r\nthemselves. These countries will be invited to create all the\r\nconditions necessary to persuade donor countries and\r\ninstitutions to help them carry out their plans.\r\nKuwait would like also to express its appreciation\r\nfor the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of the General\r\nAssembly for the Mid-term Review of the Implementation\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s, and especially for the work of the\r\nChairman of that body, Ambassador Owada of Japan. In\r\nthis context, the African countries must be aware of the\r\nimportance of sustainable development in their countries.\r\nThey must shake off the horrors of war and military\r\nconflict, with their accompanying devastation of human\r\nand material resources. Such conflict also discourages\r\npotential investors. Human and material support are the\r\nkeystone of — indeed, the key to — sustainable\r\ndevelopment throughout in the world.\r\nKuwait attaches great importance to development\r\nprojects and plans in Africa. We are proud that our\r\ninterest in development in Africa, and our assistance for\r\ndevelopment, did not begin only in the 1990s, but extends\r\nmuch further back than that. We appreciate the growing\r\ninterest of the international community in development in\r\nvarious parts of the world, including Africa. Kuwait has\r\nprovided financial assistance for development plans in\r\nAfrica at the official level and at a people-oriented level.\r\nKuwait firmly believes that it is very important for\r\nAfrica to achieve a certain stability and prosperity. I\r\nshould like to give details of loans provided by the\r\nKuwaiti development fund. We have provided 142 low-\r\ninterest loans, amounting to about $1.5 billion, to 33\r\ncountries in Africa. In addition, we have 42 technical\r\nassistance projects, involving 25 African countries, with\r\nan overall value of approximately $25 million. The\r\ncountries that receive such Kuwaiti assistance have also\r\nbenefited from the initiative of the Amir of our country to\r\nwrite off all interest due to Kuwait. His Highness Sheikh\r\nJaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah announced the\r\ninitiative on 27 September 1990 in the General Assembly.\r\nThe reasoning behind the initiative is that we feel a\r\ncertain solidarity with some countries, including African\r\nones, and understand the material difficulties that have\r\nresulted from the accumulation of loans, which impede\r\ntheir development efforts. On a human level, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in Kuwait have played an\r\nimportant role, which is greatly appreciated by the people\r\nof Africa. I should like to refer to some of these\r\ninitiatives. The African Muslim Agency has been\r\nproviding grants and assistance to many African countries\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nsince 1981. The Agency focuses on training, which we\r\nbelieve is the key to enabling people to make a better future\r\nfor themselves. Some 95,000 African students have been\r\nable to study with grants provided by this non-governmental\r\norganization, and 200 higher education scholarships have\r\nbeen provided for engineering and technology. We are\r\ninvolved in 34 rural hospitals and dispensaries, 76 water\r\nsupply operations, and various projects for women. Some\r\n$8.5 million have been provided to assist refugee children\r\nin Somalia. Many other programmes have also been carried\r\nout by Kuwaiti organizations.\r\nToday, I should like to emphasize that all of Kuwait’s\r\ndevelopment assistance is based on thorough study and\r\nmonitoring by the competent bodies in my country, which\r\nare anxious to ensure that such assistance is best used to\r\nrespond to the real needs of the citizens of African\r\ncountries. We are establishing scientific and teaching funds\r\nand economic projects, all of which will be very productive\r\nand beneficial. Kuwait offers this assistance in a spirit of\r\nfriendship and on the basis of our close links with the\r\ncountries of Africa.\r\nRegarding cooperation, I might mention that Kuwait\r\nco-chairs the African-Arab group with Burkina Faso. We do\r\nthis to ensure that we have dialogue with African countries\r\non issues of mutual concern and interest — for example,\r\ndevelopment in all of its aspects. In addition, Kuwait chairs\r\nthe committee of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference that is involved in combating desertification in\r\ncountries in the Sahel. This committee meets regularly, and\r\nthe next meeting will be in Kuwait in a few days. All of\r\nthis shows that Kuwait is anxious to help its brother\r\nAfrican countries overcome the obstacles they face in their\r\nefforts to develop.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to highlight the importance\r\nfor African countries of realizing that without peace and\r\nstability there can be no development. Creating and\r\nmanaging development requires the political will of all the\r\ncountries of Africa, to ensure a certain degree of\r\nintegration. There are projects and plans designed to ensure\r\ndevelopment in Africa, but they require stability. They can\r\nthen lead to the prosperity that we all hope for in the world\r\nof the future.\r\nWe thank God, and we request his assistance.\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho): Permit me at the outset to\r\nextend our warm appreciation to Ambassador Hisashi\r\nOwada of Japan, as Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nof the Whole of the General Assembly for the Mid-term\r\nReview of the Implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, and\r\nto his Bureau for the impressive manner in which they\r\nguided the mid-term review. I should also like to thank,\r\nthrough Ambassador Owada, the Government of Japan for\r\nthe unwavering interest that it continues to manifest in the\r\nfortunes of the people of Africa through the several\r\nmeetings and conferences it has organized devoted to\r\nfinding solutions to Africa’s problems. Let me further\r\ndeclare that my delegation completely endorses the views\r\nof the Chairman of the Group of 77 and China, as well as\r\nthose to be expressed by the Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity.\r\nWithout a vision, any development effort is likely to\r\nfail. Through the mid-term review of the implementation\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), Africa and her\r\ndevelopment partners have emerged with a refocused\r\nvision and with the resolve to make the second half of the\r\nAgenda the bridge to a successful new millennium.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Committee examined whence the\r\nAfrican region came, where its development effort stands,\r\nand what the way forward is. In the process they came to\r\nthe conclusion that yes, some progress has been made, but\r\nclearly not enough. Indeed, in some respects it could even\r\nbe said that Africa has moved backwards. Let us, in this\r\nregard, consider the following findings of the mid-term\r\nreview. First, many of the critical social and economic\r\nproblems that led to the adoption of UN-NADAF in 1991\r\nstill exist, and in some countries the problems have even\r\nworsened. Secondly, it had been estimated that in order to\r\nachieve a real annual growth rate in gross national\r\nproduct of at least 6 per cent over the course of the\r\n1990s, African countries needed a minimum of $30\r\nbillion in official development assistance in 1992, an\r\namount which then needed to grow at 4 per cent per\r\nannum. This amount, however, stood at only $26.4 billion\r\nin 1995. Thirdly, Africa’s external debt increased from\r\n$300 billion in 1991 to $322 billion in 1995.\r\nIt is against this background that a proper assessment\r\ncan be made of the implementation of the Agenda. On\r\none level the review was a resounding success in that\r\nAfrica and her partners reached a consensus, often after\r\nprolonged and intensive debate, on the slow progress that\r\nhad been achieved and on the enormous tasks that still lie\r\nahead. On another level, however, it was clearly\r\nrecognized that the implementation had left much to be\r\ndesired.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nThe review comes at a time when a dark cloud hangs\r\nover the future of international economic cooperation, a\r\nsituation that has an especially ominous portent for Africa,\r\nthe continent with the most pressing economic problems.\r\nAfrica is mired in poverty, political instability, a crushing\r\ndebt burden, declining living standards and diminishing\r\nhope for meaningful lives for the majority of her people.\r\nWhen called upon to make sacrifices, the people of Africa,\r\nas the review has demonstrated, have done so with\r\nimpressive fortitude, and yet the prospect that such\r\nsacrifices will ensure a better life remains elusive. The\r\nidealism that inspired the creation of the United Nations at\r\nSan Francisco 51 years ago seems to be only a chimera\r\nnow. The lofty words of the Charter, “to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom”,\r\nring hollow today as we witness occasional fatigue on the\r\npart of our partners.\r\nI say “occasional” because from time to time there\r\nhave also been glimmers of hopeful signs of continuing\r\ncommitment to assisting Africa. One such glimmer is the\r\nenthusiasm with which the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa has been received. While we do\r\nnot consider the Special Initiative a substitute for\r\nUN-NADAF, it should complement it in a very important\r\nway. As is known, the Special Initiative’s target for\r\nexpenditures is $25 billion per annum, while that of\r\nUN-NADAF is $30 billion. It is clear, therefore, that the\r\nshortfall must be met somehow.\r\nThe problems of Africa present a challenge to the\r\nentire international community to manifest its abiding\r\ncommitment to a collective destiny in which the deprivation\r\nof each and every member of the human race is the concern\r\nof all of us. We live in a world of contradictions. At the\r\npolitical level we each insist most strenuously on our\r\nseparateness and on the inviolability of our sovereignty. Yet\r\non the economic plane we are inexorably moving towards\r\nthe erasure of distinguishing boundaries; we are\r\nconstructing a single economic space in which goods and\r\nservices will move without let or hindrance. The new\r\nphenomenon of globalization requires that we open our\r\nborders to the goods and services of others and in so doing\r\ngive testimony to our oneness. Is it not time that we gave\r\ntangible meaning to the interdependence inherent in\r\nglobalization by reviving the spirit that animated the\r\nfounding fathers (unfortunately mothers were excluded at\r\nthat time) of the United Nations?\r\nThe outcome of the mid-term review presents a\r\nchallenge to the international community to mobilize the\r\nfinancial resources required to bring about Africa’s\r\neconomic transformation. We are sometimes told that\r\nAfrica’s recovery cannot be achieved by donor-led\r\ninitiatives, but by the greater involvement of the private\r\nsector. We believe that is only part of the story, however.\r\nThe full story is that for the majority of African countries\r\nreliance on foreign direct investment is not realistic, as\r\nstatistics have repeatedly shown that such investment goes\r\nto only a handful of developing countries — those that\r\nhave already evinced a measure of economic\r\ndevelopment. The basic infrastructure that would attract\r\nprivate investment to Africa is lacking in the great\r\nmajority of the countries.\r\nHence, it is inevitable that official development\r\nassistance should continue to play a major role in the\r\nrecovery process of these countries. Indeed, that was the\r\nunanimous conclusion of the Tokyo Conference on\r\nDevelopment Strategy that was hosted by the Government\r\nof Japan in March 1995. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to\r\nexpect private investment to be made in the social sectors\r\nof health and education. For their part, African people and\r\ntheir leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the\r\nimmense task of bettering their prospects of recovery\r\nthrough ongoing programmes of political and economic\r\nreform, releasing the energies — both physical and\r\nintellectual — of the citizenry through the protection and\r\npromotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights,\r\nand through the empowerment of women and youth, who\r\nare the underutilized agents of economic endeavour.\r\nAfrica’s resilience and ability to pick itself up from\r\nthe ashes like the proverbial phoenix are a matter of\r\nhistorical record. I have no doubt that African leaders and\r\nAfrican people will rise to the present challenge and will\r\ntake into their own hands their fate in the next century. It\r\nis a positive omen and a source of promise that there is\r\nmuch confluence of thought and strategy between the\r\nOrganization of African Unity’s Cairo declaration on\r\nAfrican development and the outcome of the mid-term\r\nreview of UN-NADAF.\r\nOn the basis of the wealth of experience available\r\nwithin the United Nations system and the continuing\r\ncommitment of Africa’s development partners to the\r\nregion’s socio-economic advancement, coupled with\r\nheartening new evidence of our continent’s increasing\r\nrespect for and dedication to the core values of sound\r\ngovernance, there is yet hope for Africa. As the review\r\nindicates, quite a few countries have achieved the growth\r\nrate of 6 per cent or above which was set by\r\nUN-NADAF. We look at their achievements with more\r\nhope than envy, and we draw inspiration from their\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nsuccess. We are also convinced that the majority of the\r\ninternational community still believes in international\r\ncooperation, especially among the countries of the South.\r\nThus, South-South cooperation holds great promise as a\r\ncomplement to the traditional cooperation that Africa has\r\nhad with its development partners of the North. In this\r\nregard, we have been heartened by the expressions of\r\nsolidarity that we have received from the countries of the\r\nSouth.\r\nThe Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has\r\nprepared estimates of projected resource requirements, set\r\nout in document A/51/228/Add.1. I consider it appropriate\r\nto conclude with a direct quotation from the ECA’s\r\naddendum to the Secretary-General’s report:\r\n“While it is the primary responsibility of African\r\nStates to bear the bulk of their development burden by\r\ntapping as a matter of priority their own financial\r\nresources, the rigid international economic\r\nenvironment, the domestic economic hardship and the\r\nlukewarm disposition of some creditors to adopt\r\nradical measures have constituted obstacles to the\r\nmobilization of financial resources and to the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. Most African countries will be\r\nunable to implement the economic reforms required\r\nfor development without further domestic and foreign\r\nfinancial resources. Nor can Africans and the\r\ninternational community afford to see yet another\r\ninternational initiative for Africa’s socio-economic\r\nrecovery and development fail.” (A/51/228/Add.1,\r\npara. 53)\r\nMr. Illueca (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe Government of Panama has faithfully supported United\r\nNations actions for the development of Africa. Today’s\r\ndiscussion of the mid-term review of the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the l990s (UN-NADAF), gives my delegation an\r\nopportunity once again to put on record our voice and our\r\nwill, joining with those of others wishing to help channel\r\ninternational assistance towards actions better directed to\r\nplacing Africa on the path to sustainable development and\r\nto the true well-being of the peoples of that continent. With\r\nthis in mind, my delegation endorses the statement made on\r\nthis question by the delegation of Costa Rica on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nIn the case of Africa, no Panamanian can fail to have\r\na vision and an interested opinion. This interest is based on\r\nthe extraordinary contribution made to Panamanian culture\r\nby African men and women and their descendants who\r\ncame directly to Panama as early as the sixteenth century,\r\nand then in the nineteenth century, and then again at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century from Caribbean\r\nislands. These Africans, who arrived in Panama at\r\ndifferent times, blended with our national character and\r\nenriched it, bringing their nuances to our views of music,\r\npoetry and art, and influencing our daily lives in a way\r\nthat protected Panamanians from the distorted images\r\nwhich the West has often had of Africa.\r\nFor Panamanians, since the sixteenth century,\r\nAfricans from east or west came from a geography which,\r\nalthough unknown, was never considered far away or\r\nalien, as it was for other peoples in other latitudes and\r\nregions. The African members of the Panamanian people\r\nhave overcome the test of integration and for a long time\r\nhave been a deep and lasting part of our national reality.\r\nPanamanians do not lose sight of the fact that we are\r\npart of a world in which the unity of the human species\r\ndepends on the constant exercise of solidarity. Panama\r\nconfirms its solidarity with Africa because we recognize\r\nthat Africa is exceptional. It has been acknowledged by\r\nthe United Nations, by the specialized agencies and by the\r\nentire international community as a whole as exceptional\r\nin terms of urgencies and opportunities, which calls for an\r\nexceptional mobilization of political will, and of human,\r\ntechnological and financial resources in order to speed up\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of\r\nthe decade and beyond, in later years, in line with the\r\ndraft resolution recommended in section IV of document\r\nA/51/48. To act towards the development of Africa has\r\nbecome urgent; this is tantamount to saying that what is\r\ntoday being programmed and done has been needed since\r\nyesterday.\r\nIn April of this year, something which happened\r\nhere at the United Nations was in tune with the urgent\r\nneed to work towards priority objectives for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa, and to do so in a more effective,\r\nmore rapid and efficient way. I am referring to the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative on Africa. The Initiative provides a global\r\napproach to Africa’s urgent needs and brings together all\r\nof the agencies and mechanisms of the system, including\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, in financing the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s.\r\nIn August of this year, it was my personal honour to\r\nparticipate in Tokyo, Japan, at a high-level seminar on the\r\ndevelopment of Africa, generously organized by the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 5 November 1996\r\nJapanese Government. At that seminar, I had the occasion\r\nof welcoming the Special Initiative on Africa. My\r\ndelegation wishes to recognize the work done by\r\nAmbassadors Owada of Japan, Insanally of Guyana, Reyn\r\nof Belgium and Dangue Rewaka from Gabon, which has\r\ngiven us a clearer idea of all aspects of United Nations\r\nconsideration of items relating to the development of\r\nAfrica.\r\nNow, two months later, today’s debate gives me the\r\nopportunity to reiterate that the delegation of Panama is\r\namong the delegations interested in Africa and its future\r\nfor reasons very similar to those contained in the well-\r\nknown statement by President Nelson Mandela: because\r\nwe\r\n“dare to think that what we are about is people”.\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 37th meeting, p. 6)\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
