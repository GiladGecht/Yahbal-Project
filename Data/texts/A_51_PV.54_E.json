(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 15 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(c) Election of five members of the International Court\r\nof Justice\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General (A/51/333)\r\nList of candidates (A/51/334/Rev.1 and Corr.1)\r\nCurricula vitae (A/51/335 and Corr.1)\r\nThe President: This morning, the General Assembly\r\nwill proceed to the election of five members of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice for a nine-year term\r\ncommencing on 6 February 1997. The terms of office of\r\nthe following judges expire the previous day:\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, Mr. Stephen M. Schwebel,\r\nMr. Mohamed Shahabuddeen, Mr. Vladlen S. Vereshchetin\r\nand Mr. Luigi Ferrari Bravo.\r\nIn connection with the election, I should like to bring\r\nthe following matters to the attention of the members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFirst, in accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n264 (III) of 8 October 1948, a State which is a party to the\r\nStatute of the International Court of Justice but not a\r\nMember of the United Nations shall participate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly in electing the members of the Court\r\nin the same manner as the States Members of the United\r\nNations. Therefore, on this occasion, the representatives\r\nof Nauru and Switzerland may participate in the election.\r\nSecondly, I should like to confirm that, at this time,\r\nthe Security Council, independently of the General\r\nAssembly, is also proceeding to elect five members of the\r\nCourt. This procedure is in accordance with Article 8 of\r\nthe Statute of the Court, which provides that\r\n“The General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil shall proceed independently of one another\r\nto elect the members of the Court.”\r\nAccordingly, the results of the voting in the General\r\nAssembly will not be communicated to the Security\r\nCouncil until five candidates have obtained the required\r\nmajority in the Assembly.\r\nFinally, I should like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the documents relating to the election. The\r\nlist of candidates which have been nominated by national\r\ngroups is to be found in document A/51/334/Rev.1 and\r\nCorr.1. The curricula vitae of the candidates are to be\r\nfound in document A/51/335 and Corr.1. The Assembly\r\nalso has before it document A/51/333, containing a\r\nmemorandum by the Secretary-General on the present\r\ncomposition of the Court and the procedure to be\r\nfollowed in the Assembly and the Security Council with\r\nregard to the election.\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 6 November 1996\r\nIn accordance with article 10, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an\r\nabsolute majority of votes both in the Assembly and in the\r\nSecurity Council shall be considered as elected.\r\nThe consistent practice of the United Nations has been\r\nto interpret the words “absolute majority” as meaning a\r\nmajority of all electors whether or not they vote or are\r\nallowed to vote. The electors in the General Assembly are\r\nall 185 Member States, plus the two non-Member States\r\nwhich are parties to the Statute of the Court, namely Nauru\r\nand Switzerland, for a total of 187 electors. Accordingly,\r\nfor the present election, 94 votes constitute an absolute\r\nmajority in the General Assembly.\r\nThe General Assembly will now proceed to a secret\r\nballot. If in the first ballot fewer than five candidates obtain\r\nan absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to\r\nfurther ballots until five candidates have obtained that\r\nmajority. Pursuant to the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its 915th meeting, held on 16 November 1960,\r\nthese ballots shall be unrestricted.\r\nI should like to remind representatives that, pursuant\r\nto rule 88 of the Assembly’s rules of procedure,\r\n“After the President has announced the beginning\r\nof voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting\r\nexcept on a point of order in connection with the\r\nactual conduct of the voting.”\r\nTherefore, any announcements, such as those\r\nconcerning withdrawals of candidatures, should be made\r\nprior to the commencement of the voting process, that is to\r\nsay, before the distribution of ballot papers.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to the\r\nprocedures I have just outlined?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Ballot papers will now be distributed.\r\nThe voting process has now begun.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to use only the ballot\r\npapers now being distributed. Only those candidates whose\r\nnames appear on the ballot papers are eligible.\r\nRepresentatives will indicate the five candidates for whom\r\nthey wish to vote by placing crosses to the left of their\r\nnames on the ballot papers. Ballot papers on which more\r\nthan five names are marked will be considered invalid.\r\nVotes may be cast only for those whose names appear on\r\nthe ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Kraulytė\r\n(Lithuania), Mr. Augusto (Mozambique), Ms. Lind\r\n(Norway), Ms. Peña (Peru) and Ms. Santipitaks\r\n(Thailand) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.40 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 183\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 183\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 183\r\nRequired absolute majority: 94\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui (Algeria) 149\r\nMr. Vladlen S. Vereshchetin (Russian\r\nFederation) 123\r\nMr. Pieter H. Kooijmans (Netherlands) 111\r\nMr. Stephen M. Schwebel (United States\r\nof America) 110\r\nMr. José Francisco Rezek (Brazil) 97\r\nMr. José Antonio Pastor Ridruejo (Spain) 83\r\nMr. Mehmet Güney (Turkey) 70\r\nMr. Patrick Robinson (Jamaica) 69\r\nMr. Mohamed Shahabuddeen (Guyana) 55\r\nMr. Francisco Orrego Vicuña (Chile) 26\r\nMr. Murat K. Azimov (Uzbekistan) 12\r\nThe following five candidates have obtained an\r\nabsolute majority in the General Assembly:\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, Mr. Pieter H. Kooijmans,\r\nMr. José Francisco Rezek, Mr. Stephen M. Schwebel and\r\nMr. Vladlen S. Vereshchetin.\r\nI have communicated the result of the voting to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council.\r\nI have received from the President of the Security\r\nCouncil the following letter:\r\n“I have the honour to inform you that at the\r\n3709th meeting of the Security Council, held on 6\r\nNovember 1996, for the purpose of electing five\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 6 November 1996\r\nmembers of the International Court of Justice for a\r\nterm of office beginning on 6 February 1997,\r\nMr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, Mr. Pieter H. Kooijmans,\r\nMr. Francisco Rezek, Mr. Stephen M. Schwebel and\r\nMr. Vladlen S. Vereshchetin obtained an absolute\r\nmajority of votes.”\r\nAs a result of the independent voting in the Security\r\nCouncil and in the General Assembly, the following five\r\ncandidates have obtained an absolute majority in both\r\norgans: Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui, Mr. Pieter H.\r\nKooijmans, Mr. José Francisco Rezek, Mr. Stephen M.\r\nSchwebel and Mr. Vladlen S. Vereshchetin. They are,\r\ntherefore, duly elected members of the International Court\r\nof Justice to serve for a nine-year term commencing on\r\n6 February 1997. I take this opportunity to extend to them\r\nthe Assembly’s congratulations on their election and to\r\nthank the tellers for their assistance.\r\nWe have thus concluded our consideration of sub-\r\nitem (c) of agenda item 15.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n3\r\n"
