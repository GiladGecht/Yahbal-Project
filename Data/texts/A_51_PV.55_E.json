The statute also provides that in the\r\nCommission as a whole representation of the main forms\r\nof civilization and of the principal legal systems of the\r\nworld should be assured.\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nAccording to the statute, the members of the\r\nCommission are eligible for re-election. The present\r\nmembership of the Commission is set out in the annex to\r\ndocument A/51/177 of 26 June 1996.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure\r\nof the General Assembly, the election shall be held by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nAccording to paragraph 3 of General Assembly\r\nresolution 36/39, the 34 members should be elected as\r\nfollows:\r\n(a) Eight nationals from African States;\r\n(b) Seven nationals from Asian States;\r\n(c) Four nationals from Eastern European States;\r\n(d) Seven nationals from Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States;\r\n(e) Eight nationals from Western European and other\r\nStates.\r\nThe ballot papers reflect this pattern. Representatives\r\nare requested to place a cross to the left of the names of the\r\ncandidates for whom they wish to vote, but for no more\r\nthan the number of seats allocated to each region.\r\nRepresentatives may vote only for those candidates whose\r\nnames appear on the ballot papers.\r\nI should like to inform members that the number of\r\ncandidates not exceeding the number of seats to be filled,\r\nreceiving the greatest number of votes and not less than the\r\nmajority of the votes of the Member States present and\r\nvoting shall be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for\r\na remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to\r\nthose candidates who have obtained an equal number of\r\nvotes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that\r\nprocedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and\r\nE will now be distributed. I request the representatives to\r\nuse only those ballot papers and, as I stated before, to place\r\na cross at the left of the names of the candidates for whom\r\nthey wish to vote, but for no more than the number of seats\r\nallocated to each region. A ballot paper containing more\r\nvotes than the number of seats allocated to the relevant\r\nregion will be declared invalid.\r\nAccordingly, please ensure that the ballot papers\r\nmarked A, for African States, do not contain votes for\r\nmore than eight candidates; the ballot papers marked B,\r\nfor Asian States, do not contain votes for more than seven\r\ncandidates; the ballot papers marked C, for Eastern\r\nEuropean States, do not contain votes for more than four\r\ncandidates; the ballot papers marked D, for Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, do not contain votes for\r\nmore than seven candidates; and the ballot papers marked\r\nE, for Western European and other States, do not contain\r\nvotes for more than eight candidates.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Ahsan\r\n(Bangladesh), Mr. Serdzukou (Belarus), Ms. Alvarez\r\n(Cuba), Ms. Mattila (Finland) and Mr. Mwangi\r\n(Kenya) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.45 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGROUP A\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 181\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 181\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 181\r\nRequired majority: 91\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Nabil Elaraby (Egypt) 151\r\nMr. James Lutabanzibwa Kateka (United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania) 133\r\nMr. Christopher John Robert Dugard\r\n(South Africa) 130\r\nMr. Doudou Thiam (Senegal) 128\r\nMr. Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco) 119\r\nMr. Emmanuel Akwei Addo (Ghana) 105\r\nMr. Guillaume Pambou-Tchivounda (Gabon) 97\r\nMr. Peter C.
