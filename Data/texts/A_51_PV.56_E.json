(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 25\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/299)\r\nDraft resolution (A/51/L.14/Rev.1)\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of Saint\r\nLucia to introduce draft resolution A/51/L.14/Rev.1.\r\nMs. Leonce-Carrly (Saint Lucia): I should like at the\r\noutset, on behalf of the member States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM), to express our sincere\r\ncondolences to the people and Government of India on the\r\nloss of property and life during the recent cyclone.\r\nOn behalf of the 13 member States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity — Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados,\r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nSuriname and Trinidad and Tobago — that are Members of\r\nthe United Nations, of the sponsors listed in the document\r\nand of additional sponsors Argentina, Australia, Denmark,\r\nEstonia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands,\r\nPakistan, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden,\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nand the United States of America, I have the honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/51/L.14/Rev.1, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community”, with the following oral revisions\r\nto operative paragraph 7.\r\nFirst, the word “Requests” should be replaced with\r\n“Recommends”. Secondly, the following phrase should be\r\ndeleted: “in conjunction with the Conference on\r\nGovernance and Development”. The new operative\r\nparagraph 7 now reads:\r\n“Recommends that the first general meeting\r\nbetween representatives of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity and its associated institutions and of the\r\nUnited Nations system be held in 1997, for the\r\npurpose of holding consultations on projects,\r\nmeasures and procedures to facilitate and strengthen\r\ncooperation between those organizations.”\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations places emphasis\r\non the promotion of peace and security as well as on the\r\neconomic, social and cultural development of Member\r\nStates. Chapter VIII of the Charter also provides for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations. This arrangement — cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and CARICOM — rests on the\r\nprinciples, purposes and practices of those provisions.\r\nIn establishing CARICOM in 1973 and its\r\npredecessor, CARIFTA, in 1964, CARICOM States have\r\ndemonstrated their intention to pursue multilateral\r\ncooperation in the advancement of their political,\r\neconomic, social and cultural development. Since 1985,\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nthe Caribbean Community has invited the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General to be represented at their summits and\r\nhas cooperated with the representatives of United Nations\r\nprogrammes and agencies at the regional level. CARICOM\r\nwelcomed the participation of its Secretary-General in the\r\nsecond meeting between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations convened by the Secretary-General in\r\nFebruary 1996.\r\nCARICOM member States have themselves\r\nparticipated actively in regional and international forums,\r\nand, while emphasizing their unique needs and aspirations,\r\nhave also proposed possible solutions to their problems.\r\nIn 1991, the General Assembly granted observer status\r\nto CARICOM. Then, in 1994, CARICOM Heads of\r\nGovernment requested the Secretary-General of CARICOM\r\nto seek an even closer relationship with the United Nations,\r\nthereby affirming the growing partnership between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nAt their 1994 meeting, CARICOM Heads of\r\nGovernment decided to support the international community\r\nin the restoration of democracy in Haiti. CARICOM’s\r\nparticipation in the multinational force and the United\r\nNations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) was its first experience\r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. On several\r\noccasions, the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nexpressed the international community’s appreciation of the\r\nspecial role played by CARICOM in this mission. The\r\nestablishment and continuation by CARICOM of a joint\r\nCARICOM-Haiti commission is evidence of the seriousness\r\nwith which CARICOM accepts its partnership role.\r\nThe General Assembly adopted resolution A/49/141 on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and CARICOM on\r\n20 December 1994. The report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthis item, contained in document A/51/299, outlines the\r\nactivities of the United Nations system in the\r\nimplementation of that resolution. The draft resolution\r\ncurrently before the Assembly, A/51/L.14/Rev.1, seeks to\r\nbuild on the partnership between this global Organization\r\nand its subregional counterpart. In its preambular part, the\r\ndraft resolution draws attention to the importance of\r\nfurthering CARICOM’s role in the development of peace\r\nand security within the Caribbean region; the promotion of\r\nmeetings between the representatives of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General and the Secretary-General of CARICOM\r\nfor consultations on policies, projects, measures and\r\nprocedures that will facilitate and broaden cooperation and\r\ncoordination between them; and the strengthening of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity in the area of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, as well as of political and humanitarian\r\naffairs.\r\nIn its operative part, the draft resolution takes note\r\nof the very comprehensive report of the Secretary-General\r\nand of his efforts to strengthen cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and CARICOM.\r\nIn addition, the draft resolution draws attention to\r\nthe priority areas of cooperation approved by the Standing\r\nCommittee of Ministers Responsible for Foreign Affairs.\r\nThese include follow-up to the global conferences; the\r\nadvancement of the new global human order; the law of\r\nthe sea; follow-up and implementation of the Programme\r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States; the development of poverty\r\nreduction programmes; peacekeeping; diplomatic training;\r\ngovernance and development in the Caribbean; and the\r\nstrengthening of the regional Secretariat information base.\r\nFurthermore, A/51/L.14/Rev.1 invites the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue taking the necessary measures for\r\npromoting and expanding cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity in order to increase the capacity of the two\r\norganizations to attain their objectives and requests the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community, or their representatives, to hold\r\nconsultations with a view to signing an agreement on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community.\r\nThe draft resolution calls upon the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations to consult with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of CARICOM to assist in furthering the\r\ndevelopment of peace and security in the region in the\r\ncontext of preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping.\r\nWe attach great importance and significance to the\r\nholding of the first general meeting between\r\nrepresentatives of the Caribbean Community and its\r\nassociated institutions and of the United Nations system\r\nin 1997, as recommended in paragraph 7.\r\nCARICOM member States also attach great\r\nimportance to paragraph 8, which requests the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, or their representatives, to encourage inter-\r\nagency, sectoral and focal point meetings on areas of priority.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nIn conclusion, mindful of the current financial\r\nsituation of the United Nations, CARICOM member States\r\nwould propose a biennial reporting mechanism, without\r\nprejudice to efficient and cost-effective consultation and\r\ncoordination between the two organizations.\r\nI hope that the draft resolution will receive the support\r\nof all the members of the Assembly. From its inception,\r\nCARICOM has always upheld the principles of the Charter\r\nand this act of confirmation of its full partnership role\r\nwould further enhance effective cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations at a time of challenges and opportunities.\r\nMr. Turnquest (Bahamas): Allow me, first of all, to\r\nexpress the sympathy of my Government to the\r\nGovernment and people of India on the loss of life and\r\ndamage to property due to the recent cyclone.\r\nIn the post-cold-war era, the United Nations has an\r\nimportant role to play in coordinating and harmonizing the\r\nefforts of nations to achieve common objectives. Such\r\naspirations include the attainment of international peace and\r\nsecurity, cooperation in the economic, social and cultural\r\nfields and the fostering of respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nIn this connection, the United Nations must be seen as\r\na mechanism not only by which the voices of all nations\r\ncan be heard, irrespective of size or wealth, but also\r\nwhereby constructive action is taken on behalf of all the\r\nworld’s peoples, particularly those who are most in need of\r\nassistance. As stated by the Foreign Minister of the\r\nBahamas in her address to this session of the General\r\nAssembly:\r\n“The Bahamas is convinced that the United Nations\r\nremains the primary world body with the capacity and\r\npolitical will to bring together the disparate elements\r\nof the international community so as to face and deal\r\nwith the challenges of the twenty-first century.”\r\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-first\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 24th meeting, p. 12)\r\nThe Bahamas is pleased to note that the dynamic\r\npartnership between the United Nations and various\r\nregional organizations over the years has been instrumental\r\nin paving the way towards the attainment of our common\r\ngoals. It is important that we take all necessary measures to\r\nfoster and strengthen the environment of positive\r\ncollaboration. Thus, the Bahamas welcomes the information\r\ncontained in the first report of the Secretary- General on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity. It clearly shows that, since the granting of\r\nobserver status to CARICOM in 1991, there has been\r\nconsiderable collaboration between the two organizations;\r\nindeed, there was ongoing significant joint United\r\nNations/CARICOM activity long before 1991. The report\r\nalso reveals that there are many areas where cooperation\r\ncan be strengthened even further.\r\nWe welcome, in particular, the information regarding\r\njoint activities in the areas of disaster preparedness and\r\nprevention and international drug control, given the\r\npeculiar problems experienced by the region in these\r\nmatters. Also, the signing of the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding for cooperation by CARICOM and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC) can only augur well for the future\r\ngiven the high level of cooperation which has existed in\r\nthe past between CARICOM countries and ECLAC, in\r\nparticular the Caribbean Development and Cooperation\r\nCommittee.\r\nWe are also pleased to learn that, during the period\r\nunder review, high-level officials participated in meetings\r\nand consultations of both organizations. This can only\r\nfurther the process of finding effective ways to work\r\ntogether. We note that, within the United Nations\r\nSecretariat, a new arrangement has been introduced to\r\nallow greater flexibility in cooperation and coordination\r\nand that it is expected that this new mechanism:\r\n“will facilitate more pragmatic and cost-effective\r\ncooperation between the two organizations”.\r\n(A/51/299, para. 12)\r\nThe Bahamas is supportive of any step that is taken\r\nfor the purpose of greater efficiency. However, we trust\r\nthat, within this new arrangement, appropriate steps will\r\nbe taken to ensure the continuation of collaboration at the\r\nhighest levels of both organizations and that all activities\r\nwill be carried out in a coordinated manner.\r\nThe Bahamas is of the view that there could have\r\nbeen more information in the report on activities to be\r\nundertaken by some of the key areas of the Secretariat.\r\nFor example, apart from information on small island\r\ndeveloping States follow-up, there was no information on\r\nactivities to be undertaken by the Department for Policy\r\nCoordination and Sustainable Development. Given the\r\nrole that it will play in the follow-up to the recent United\r\nNations conferences, all of which are of immense\r\nimportance to CARICOM countries, it would have been\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nuseful to learn of that Department’s plans to facilitate\r\ncooperation.\r\nSimilarly, we would have welcomed information from\r\nthe Department for Economic and Social Information and\r\nPolicy Analysis. The enhancement of national capacity with\r\nrespect to data collection, research and analysis is of\r\nsignificant interest to CARICOM countries. Given the work\r\ndone by that Department in these areas, it would have been\r\nuseful to be apprised of their projections. Time will not\r\npermit me to comment in detail on other areas where\r\ninformation is missing. However, we hope that this lacuna\r\narises merely from the data not having been put in the\r\nreport, and not because these departments have no plans to\r\nengage in cooperative activities.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations served\r\nin the Bahamas to heighten interest in the United Nations.\r\nMost likely the same is true of other CARICOM countries.\r\nFuture joint public information activities should aim to\r\nmaintain and build upon this increased awareness.\r\nInformation on the work of both organizations should be\r\npublicized; such information should be of relevance to the\r\nregion and should be widely disseminated in a timely\r\nmanner.\r\nGiven the importance of the development of human\r\nresources in the region, it would be useful in future reports\r\nto have information from entities such as United Nations\r\nInstitute for Training and Research and the United Nations\r\nUniversity. There is wide scope in these areas for activities\r\nsuch as training, fellowships, scientific exchanges and the\r\npreparation and distribution of publications. Similarly, in\r\nthe light of the escalation of crime in the region, we would\r\nwelcome information from the Division for Crime\r\nPrevention and Criminal Justice.\r\nThe next logical step in this growing partnership\r\nbetween the two organizations would be the establishment\r\nof a formal agreement, as called for in the draft resolution\r\nwhich is before us (A/51/L.14/Rev.1). The final\r\ncommuniqué of the 1996 meeting of the CARICOM\r\nStanding Committee of Ministers Responsible for Foreign\r\nAffairs provides useful parameters within which such an\r\nagreement could be based.\r\nIt is the hope of my delegation that, in the course of\r\nelaborating an agreement, due attention will be paid to\r\ndeveloping cooperative activities in areas such as trafficking\r\nin small arms and the trans-shipment of hazardous waste\r\nthrough the region. Both of these activities are of grave\r\nconcern to the region. Efforts should begin as soon as\r\npossible to draft an agreement as a framework for\r\nrelations between CARICOM and the United Nations.\r\nThe Bahamas is of the view that collaborative action\r\nis on the right track, and we wish to commend both\r\norganizations for activities undertaken to date. Further\r\nsuccess will depend on the willingness of both entities to\r\ncontinue to engage in constructive dialogue in a\r\nframework of mutual respect and harmony. We are\r\nconfident that this will be the case.\r\nIn closing, I wish to convey the full support of my\r\ndelegation for the draft resolution before us.\r\nMr. Campbell (Ireland): I express the sympathy of\r\nthe States members of the European Union to the people\r\nand the Government of India in connection with the\r\ntragedy that has affected them as a result of the recent\r\nnatural disaster.\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. The following associated countries align\r\nthemselves with this statement: Cyprus, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta,\r\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Iceland and\r\nNorway have also aligned themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the developments\r\nwhich have taken place over the last two years to\r\nstrengthen and intensify the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM). In this regard, the decision by CARICOM\r\nForeign Ministers at their twenty-second meeting, held in\r\nJamaica on 13 and 14 May 1996, to agree on new areas\r\nof activities for joint pursuit between CARICOM and the\r\nUnited Nations is of particular significance. Areas where\r\nenhanced cooperation will have special importance\r\ninclude issues related to the law of the sea, peacekeeping,\r\ncooperation in the development of poverty reduction\r\nprogrammes and in the follow-up and implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\r\nThe European Union is pleased to recall the\r\nconstructive role played by CARICOM in the restoration\r\nof democracy in Haiti and the participation of the\r\nCARICOM contingent in the United Nations Mission in\r\nHaiti. As the Secretary-General points out in his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, this was the first time that\r\nthe Community had participated in a United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operation. This type of action marks a\r\nmajor contribution to the development of peace and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nsecurity within the Caribbean region and, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly points out, serves to underline the vital role\r\nthat members of CARICOM can play in furthering the\r\nUnited Nations causes of peace, development and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and CARICOM (A/51/299)\r\ncontains a detailed list of the range of cooperation activities\r\nbetween the two organizations. The European Union\r\napplauds these developments. They testify to the dynamism\r\nand energy which the members of CARICOM have brought\r\nto their relationship with the United Nations family and\r\npoint to deeper and even more effective cooperation in the\r\nfuture.\r\nAn example of regional cooperation involving the\r\nUnited Nations undertaken at the initiative of the European\r\nUnion is the Plan of Action for Drug Control Coordination\r\nand Cooperation in the Caribbean, agreed in Barbados in\r\nMay this year. This will provide for the adoption of\r\nmeasures aimed at better national coordination, legislation,\r\nlaw enforcement, demand reduction and maritime\r\ncooperation in the field of drug control. CARICOM will\r\nplay an important role in facilitating the implementation of\r\nthis Plan of Action.\r\nThe European Union and its member States have a\r\nspecial relationship with the countries of the Caribbean. The\r\nties of history are deep and well known. However, it is the\r\nnew partnership between us that shows the strength of our\r\nlong-term commitment to the region. We have developed,\r\nin close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean\r\nregion, a strategy based on three main priorities: support for\r\nthe process of economic transition; promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the Caribbean region with particular\r\nemphasis on human resource development, the protection of\r\nnatural resources and combating socio-economic threats,\r\nincluding the fight against drugs; and the promotion of\r\nincreased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration\r\nin the world market.\r\nUnder the fourth Lomé Convention, which provides\r\n$560 million dollars to the Caribbean region, the European\r\nUnion is able to work closely with all the members of\r\nCARICOM individually and at the regional level to address\r\nthe specific problems of CARICOM members, most of\r\nwhich are small island developing States. We recognize the\r\neconomic and social difficulties which are unique to small\r\nisland developing States. Their small domestic markets,\r\ngeographical remoteness from neighbours and from\r\nextraregional markets and sources of supply, and the need\r\nfor heavy investments in transport and communications\r\naggravate the constraints to development which they must\r\nalready tackle. The region as a whole is particularly\r\nvulnerable to natural disasters and their devastating\r\nimpact on the economic growth of the countries of the\r\nCaribbean. Environmental degradation can also affect the\r\nbasis of economic and social life in the countries of the\r\nCaribbean region, as natural resources are of essential\r\nimportance to sectors such as tourism and agriculture.\r\nThe European Union would therefore encourage\r\nisland developing countries to pursue development\r\nstrategies which will take into consideration long-term\r\nrequirements for sustainable development. We reiterate\r\nour willingness to continue to provide financial and\r\ntechnical support for such measures.\r\nWe warmly welcomed the adoption in May 1994 of\r\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. The\r\nEuropean Union is actively working to ensure that it is\r\nfully implemented and can make a lasting contribution to\r\nachieving sustained economic growth and facilitate\r\nsustainable economic development.\r\nThe European Union is already sharing its own\r\nexperience of regional cooperation and integration with\r\nthe countries of the Caribbean and reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to continue to provide financial and technical\r\nassistance in support of CARICOM’s own efforts to\r\ntackle the challenges which are special to small island\r\neconomies.\r\nWe welcome the creation of the Association of\r\nCaribbean States as yet a further effort at integration, and\r\nthe Forum of Caribbean States of the African, Caribbean\r\nand Pacific countries. We believe the experience gained\r\nin the process of regional economic integration by\r\nCARICOM is a major asset in the wider integration\r\nprocess on which the entire Caribbean basin can build.\r\nIn this context, we believe that further efforts should\r\nbe made to promote regional economic integration and\r\ncooperation, which can lead to economies of scale across\r\na range of economic activities from protection of coast\r\nlines to environmental protection, trade promotion and\r\nmarket access, tourism development and the expansion of\r\ninter-island feeder services. This overall strategy should\r\nenable the achievement of international competitiveness\r\nand the gradual integration of the Caribbean into the\r\nworld economy. At the same time, the negative effects of\r\ntransition from poverty should be addressed alongside the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\neconomic reform process. In this respect, human\r\ndevelopment and capacity-building are fundamental to\r\nsustainable development in the region.\r\nThe co-sponsorship by members of the European\r\nUnion of the draft resolution, which we hope will be\r\nadopted by consensus, is testimony to the value and\r\nimportance that we continue to attach to the role of\r\nCARICOM and to its ever closer relationship with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Mpay (Cameroon) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the African Group, I wish, like the speakers\r\nbefore me, to express our deep condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of India for the loss of human life\r\nin the cyclone that recently struck the country.\r\nI am speaking in reference to agenda item 25, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community”. I speak on behalf of the African\r\nGroup.\r\nSince its inception on 4 July 1973, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM), which currently has 14 member\r\nStates, has made considerable progress towards subregional\r\nintegration. The objectives of the Community, as defined in\r\nthe Treaty of Chaguaramas — inter alia, economic\r\ncooperation through the Caribbean Common Market;\r\ncoordinated foreign policies; and creating joint services in\r\nsuch essential sectors as health, education, culture,\r\ncommunications and industrial relations — have been\r\nmethodically pursued through the establishment of\r\nappropriate Community structures by its member States. We\r\ntherefore welcome the fact that, from the erstwhile\r\nCaribbean Free Trade Association to the current\r\norganization, the Caribbean Community has made great\r\nstrides in the quest for the ways and means to strengthen\r\nsubregional integration.\r\nThirteen years after its inception, we can confirm that\r\nthe Community is doing well and has a positive record.\r\nIndeed, thanks to its efforts in such varied areas as\r\nagriculture, health, education, upholding human rights and\r\npromoting democracy, the Community has spared no effort\r\nto maintain the link between the States of the subregion and\r\ndevelopments around the world. It has particularly\r\nsensitized the countries of the subregion to the stakes\r\ninvolved in their collective future and their common\r\ndestiny.\r\nIn this respect, beyond the efforts already taken in the\r\nareas cited above, we must point out other initiatives to\r\npromote economic, social and cultural development in the\r\ncountries of the subregion are under way, strengthening\r\nthe dynamic towards subregional integration. Thus, the\r\nmeasures taken by the Heads of Government of the\r\nCaribbean Community at their seventh meeting, held in\r\nBridgetown from 3 to 7 July, this year, move in this\r\ndirection. Indeed, the Heads of Government undertook to\r\npromote, inter alia, the modernization and diversification\r\nof the agricultural sectors of their respective countries in\r\norder to make them more competitive and hence income-\r\ngenerating, and to consolidate the food self-sufficiency of\r\ntheir peoples. Moreover, the implementation of\r\nrecommendations promoting, inter alia, freedom of\r\nmovement and the establishment in the subregion of\r\nartists, musicians, athletes, journalist and university\r\ngraduates, together with even more dynamic measures,\r\ncan promote a general subregional culture of integration.\r\nIn the area of coordinating foreign policy, the\r\npresence of CARICOM in Haiti within the content of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts demonstrates\r\nunequivocally the pacific and international nature of the\r\norganization and its involvement in the search for\r\npeaceful solutions to the problems facing Belize,\r\nGuatemala, Guyana, Venezuela, Saint Kitts and Nevis and\r\nother countries. The Community’s ongoing efforts to draft\r\na civil society charter and a regional programme for\r\nwitness protection demonstrate that the Community is\r\nworking to promote and uphold human rights in the\r\ncountries of the subregion.\r\nI have listed only some of the many achievements of\r\nthe CARICOM, which are, furthermore, directly in\r\nkeeping with the objectives of the United Nations. The\r\ngranting to the Caribbean Community of observer status\r\nin the General Assembly on 16 October 1991 and the\r\nsigning in January 1995 of a memorandum of\r\nunderstanding between CARICOM and the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which\r\nis designed to promote cooperation between the\r\nCARICOM and the United Nations in several key areas,\r\nwere therefore necessary.\r\nThe CARICOM countries are small island\r\ndeveloping States whose development needs are\r\nconsiderable. We therefore welcome the productive\r\ncooperation established between CARICOM and the\r\nUnited Nations system. Document A/51/299 gives an\r\nexhaustive overview of the areas of cooperation under\r\nway between the two organizations. We encourage this\r\ncooperation and sincerely hope that it will expand to\r\nencompass joint activities between CARICOM and the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nUnited Nations, as defined at the twenty-second meeting of\r\nthe Standing Committee of Ministers Responsible for\r\nForeign Affairs, held on 13 and 14 May 1996 at Kingston,\r\nand at the seventh meeting of the Conference of Heads of\r\nGovernment of CARICOM, held from 3 to 7 July in\r\nBarbados.\r\nKey areas of cooperation include follow-up to global\r\nconferences; progress towards a new international human\r\norder; issues relating to the law of the sea; follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates; cooperation in the development of poverty reduction\r\nprogrammes; peacekeeping; diplomatic training; governance\r\nand development in the Caribbean; and the strengthening of\r\nthe Regional Secretariat Information Base.\r\nIt is only by diversifying this cooperation that the\r\nUnited Nations and CARICOM, which have common goals,\r\nwill succeed in reducing poverty, creating jobs, developing\r\nhuman resources, revitalizing trade and the economy,\r\npromoting health and education in the region — in brief,\r\nensuring sustainable development for the small island States\r\nin the region.\r\nAll of Africa therefore encourages the United Nations\r\nand the CARICOM to begin that journey. That is why we\r\nsupport the draft resolution in document A/51/L.14/Rev.1\r\nand hope that it will be approved by consensus.\r\nMr. Nún̄ ez-Mosquera (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me to express our condolences to the\r\ndelegation of India on the sad human and material losses\r\nsuffered following the cyclone in that country.\r\nWe are drawn to this podium today by the bonds of\r\nbrotherhood and solidarity that have historically linked the\r\npeople of Cuba with the peoples of the Caribbean. This\r\ntraditional brotherhood between our peoples has gone\r\nbeyond our regional relations and is reflected in all forums\r\nof the United Nations, where our status as small and\r\nvulnerable islands has strongly defined and mobilized our\r\nefforts.\r\nThe establishment of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) in July 1973 was not only a historic event for\r\nthe Caribbean countries but also a model for all those who,\r\nwith legitimate pride, foresaw and, witnessed the definitive\r\nincorporation of the Caribbean States into the United\r\nNations system in October 1991, when the Caribbean\r\nCommunity obtained observer status in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nSince that time, the 14 States of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity have benefited from cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations, its programmes and specialized agencies.\r\nBut they have also made a significant contribution, both\r\nindividually and collectively, to the work, purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nIn this regard, we would like to express our concern\r\nat the fact that the proposed medium-term plan for the\r\nperiod 1998-2001 does not grant the necessary importance\r\nto the question of small islands. The States of the\r\nCaribbean Community have been standard-bearers in the\r\ncause of peace and development. The peace processes in\r\nHaiti, Central America and Africa have benefited from\r\nthe presence and contributions of the Caribbean States.\r\nImportant international conferences on cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, on sustainable development and on trade\r\nand development, as well as the Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, have enjoyed the invaluable participation and the\r\npraise of the Caribbean States.\r\nImportant multilateral negotiations have been held\r\nunder the presidency of Caribbean countries, and, under\r\ntheir auspices, international bodies and forums have been\r\nestablished that will play a significant role in the\r\npromotion and progressive development of international\r\nlaw.\r\nCuba is honoured to participate in this debate on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community. The report submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General, pursuant to General Assembly\r\nresolution 49/141, is encouraging as to current and future\r\ncooperation between the Caribbean Community and the\r\nOrganization. Furthermore, the report accurately illustrates\r\nthe international efforts undertaken by small States,\r\nwhich, rising above their tremendous resource limitations\r\nand the adverse climate conditions inherent in their\r\ngeography, have succeeded in establishing and developing\r\nmultilateral consultation and cooperation mechanisms. In\r\nso doing, they have preserved their longstanding political,\r\nsocial and cultural commonality, as well as their\r\nunmistakable identity as members of the Caribbean and\r\nLatin American community.\r\nIn December of this year, Cuba will host a\r\nministerial meeting of the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates. Just as the General Assembly has welcomed\r\nCARICOM, the people and the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Cuba open the doors of our small country to\r\nthe brotherly States of the Caribbean. We reiterate our\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nsupport for strengthening international cooperation with\r\nCARICOM.\r\nFor many reasons — reasons as old and sacred as our\r\ncommon roots — Cuba will always support efforts to\r\npromote the progress of the brotherly peoples of the\r\nCaribbean, in the framework of the United Nations as well\r\nas in our region. We reiterate today that we will contribute\r\nto the best of our ability to the process of the fruitful\r\nintegration of our economies.\r\nWe are certain, and indeed have seen proof, that this\r\nreadiness is and always will be mutual among the\r\nCaribbean States, with which we share not only the vast sea\r\nthat bathes our shores but also the unbreakable resolve to\r\nfight for a future of peace, justice and equality among all\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nwish at the outset to convey our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\n(A/51/299).\r\nThis report details the various activities undertaken\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Caribbean Community\r\nto promote cooperation in areas of critical importance. It\r\nalso notes the various efforts by the member States of\r\nCARICOM to realize the ideals and purposes of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nOf special significance are the activities undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in the\r\nCaribbean, whose main areas of activity are education on\r\nhealth and family life, better parental training, and\r\nvocational training.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), as the main United Nations body\r\ncharged with promoting the development of island States,\r\nhas important development links to CARICOM.\r\nUNCTAD’s key activities include assistance in automating\r\ncustoms, the establishment of a commercial centre, and\r\nspecialized training programmes in trade, maritime transport\r\nand the environment. The United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) also carries out important projects\r\ntogether with the member States of CARICOM.\r\nWe appeal to the various organizations and agencies\r\nof the United Nations system to take the measures\r\nnecessary to promote and expand cooperation and\r\ncoordination with the Caribbean Community in the areas\r\nidentified by these countries. We hope that the efforts\r\ndeployed will soon result in a cooperation agreement\r\nbetween the two organizations, which, we are certain, will\r\naccord with the mandates, competence and composition\r\nof both organizations and which will adapt to each\r\nspecific situation, as provided for by the Charter.\r\nThe Caribbean enjoys priority in Mexico’s foreign\r\npolicy and has a well-defined place in its trade policy.\r\nJoined by a sea that grants us the privilege of being part\r\nof the Caribbean region, we have points of convergence\r\nwhich my country has sought to utilize and expand.\r\nMexico has stepped up its activities in the region\r\nbased on renewed support for traditional cooperation\r\nactivities with the Caribbean and identification of new\r\nand more fruitful mechanisms to that effect. We recently\r\nreopened our embassy in Trinidad and Tobago — an\r\nexample of our commitment to expand our diplomatic\r\npresence — and we are committed to launching initiatives\r\naimed at building stable and lasting relations between\r\nMexico and CARICOM.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThis initiative covers the areas of investment,\r\neducational cooperation and the promotion of business.\r\nThese activities arise from efforts already undertaken by\r\nthe Association of Caribbean States, the Caribbean\r\nDevelopment Bank and under the San José Pact.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to express Mexico’s\r\ncommitment to making further progress in its economic\r\nand social cooperation with the CARICOM member\r\nStates. My delegation trusts that the Assembly will adopt\r\nthe draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/51/L.14/Rev.1 by consensus.\r\nMr. Rubio (Colombia)(interpretation from Spanish):\r\nPermit me first to express, on behalf of my people and\r\nthe Government of Colombia, our solidarity and\r\nbrotherhood with the people of India and, in particular, its\r\ndelegation, represented at this Assembly, with regard to\r\nthe natural disaster that recently occurred on its shores, at\r\ngreat human and material cost.\r\nMy country, Colombia, a country on the Caribbean,\r\nshares with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nmember States their hopes for development and their\r\nongoing quest for a better life for their peoples. We are\r\npleased to note that this Community, following the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nvarious modalities for cooperation that the United Nations\r\nand its specialized agencies have been developing since\r\ntheir early years with various regional organizations, has\r\nfound effective methods for consultation, information\r\nexchange and cooperation with the United Nations system.\r\nThe Caribbean Community, established on 4 July\r\n1973, obtained observer status by a General Assembly\r\nresolution of 16 October 1991. Since then — according to\r\nthe report submitted by the Secretary-General pursuant to\r\nresolution 49/141 of 20 December 1994 and contained in\r\ndocument A/51/299 of 20 August 1996 — the Community,\r\nin cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, has undertaken a number of activities in various\r\nfields that have contributed to the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of its member States. The institutionalization\r\nof mechanisms of cooperation has also helped the\r\nCommunity and its member States to participate more\r\nactively in the work of the United Nations and to contribute\r\nto the achievement of its objectives.\r\nThere is no doubt that the importance attached by the\r\nGovernments of the CARICOM member States to the\r\nquestion of cooperation with the United Nations — as\r\ndemonstrated by its inclusion on the agenda of meetings of\r\nits ministers and Heads of Government and by the\r\nCommunity’s participation in regular meetings between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations and arrangements\r\nto coordinate cooperation activities — will continue to\r\nprovide strong momentum that will certainly benefit both\r\norganizations.\r\nCARICOM has been an important factor in the\r\nintegration process of the wider Caribbean basin that has\r\nopened up avenues to new and broader forms of\r\ncooperation in the region. In this regard, we recall that, on\r\n24 July 1991, on the birthday of the Liberator, Simón\r\nBolívar, Colombia, the 14 CARICOM States, the Central\r\nAmerican countries, Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican\r\nRepublic, Haiti, and Venezuela established the Association\r\nof Caribbean States, which is open to the participation of\r\nthe territories of the region as associate members and seeks\r\nto strengthen cooperation and the development of cultural,\r\neconomic, political, scientific, social and technological\r\nrelations.\r\nIn view of all this, my delegation cannot but support\r\nthe development of fruitful cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Caribbean Community.\r\nMs. Mawhinney (Canada): Allow me first to convey\r\nmy country’s condolences to the people and Government of\r\nIndia for the terrible losses they have suffered in the\r\ncyclone which has just struck their country.\r\nThe following is the text which Ambassador Fowler\r\nwas to deliver this afternoon.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“I am pleased to address the General Assembly\r\ntoday as a sponsor of the draft resolution before us,\r\nentitled Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Caribbean Community\u0027.\r\n“We have read the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) with\r\nparticular attention. It summarizes an impressive\r\nvariety of activities that the United Nations is\r\ncarrying out in the region in close cooperation with\r\nCARICOM, ranging from disaster relief to a major\r\nCaribbean-wide conference on child rights. Canada\r\nis pleased to note that a large number of concrete\r\nactions respond directly to the basic needs of the\r\npeople of the region or aim to prepare the required\r\ninfrastructure and trained personnel to tackle these\r\nproblems.\r\n“Canada is also gratified to note the large\r\nnumber of pragmatic activities aimed at promoting\r\nthe economic development of the region. We note\r\nactions at the grass roots to encourage the small- and\r\nmedium-size enterprise sector and market access for\r\nsmallholder rural producers. At the same time,\r\nconsultations to foster appropriate macroeconomic\r\npolicies and improve productivity, competitiveness\r\nand international market access contribute at the\r\nnational level to the development, expansion and\r\nadaptation of Caribbean economies within the world\r\neconomy.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“Throughout the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, mention is made of efforts to involve\r\nwomen in shaping the future of the region. That is\r\nbased on strong and laudable Caribbean traditions\r\nand Canada applauds the work of the United Nations\r\nin building on this strong historical Caribbean foundation.\r\n“Canada considers CARICOM’s cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations in Haiti as an example of\r\nthe potential for the further development of peace\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nand security within the Caribbean region and we are\r\npleased that the draft resolution before us today\r\nfocuses on that aspect of CARICOM’s regional role.\r\nThe cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nCARICOM reflects a trend which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has encouraged: cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. That\r\ncooperation means that United Nations actions result\r\nfrom close consultation with Member States and better\r\nreflect the priorities of local Governments and their\r\npeoples. At the same time, we urge CARICOM\r\nmember States and the United Nations agencies\r\ninvolved to ensure that every effort is made to avoid\r\nduplication and any dissipation of scarce resources.\r\n“Many United Nations and CARICOM priorities\r\nare also priorities for the bilateral relationship between\r\nCanada and CARICOM. In areas such as economic\r\ncooperation, commercial relations and the campaign\r\nagainst illicit drug traffic, Canada has been pleased to\r\njoin its efforts with those of partners equally dedicated\r\nto the task of improving the lives of the people of the\r\nCaribbean. These have positive effects beyond the\r\nregion, including in Canada, and we believe it\r\nimportant to support them.\r\n“Canada and the Commonwealth Caribbean share\r\na long tradition of cooperation and friendship in many\r\nareas. Our contemporary relationship, as was made\r\nclear during the recent consultations between Canada\r\nand CARICOM in Ottawa on 7 and 8 November, has\r\nevolved to address the new political, social and\r\neconomic challenges in the region. CARICOM is a\r\nvaluable interlocutor for Canada on important regional\r\nissues such as free trade and narcotics. We have\r\nsupported CARICOM countries in their efforts to\r\npursue important economic reforms in an increasingly\r\ncomplex and competitive international environment.\r\nCanada and CARICOM have also worked together\r\nhere at the United Nations, with positive results in\r\nareas such as fisheries, the proposed international\r\ncriminal court and the development of small island\r\nStates.\r\n“For these reasons, Canada encourages the\r\nUnited Nations and CARICOM to pursue what is\r\nevidently a productive relationship, and we therefore\r\nsupport the current draft resolution.”\r\nMs. Durrant (Jamaica): Let me first, on behalf of the\r\nmembers of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates, extend to the Government and people of India\r\nsincere condolences on the tragic loss of life and damage\r\nto property occasioned by the recent cyclone.\r\nOn behalf of the members of the Latin American\r\nand Caribbean Group, I should like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the report (A/51/299) on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM). This report has been\r\nsubmitted in accordance with resolution 49/141, adopted\r\nin December 1994, which formalized the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and CARICOM and which\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to report on the\r\nimplementation of the resolution at this, the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe report outlines a wide range of activities\r\nundertaken between the United Nations and CARICOM\r\npursuant to the resolution, and details programmes\r\nundertaken by different arms of the United Nations\r\nsystem within the Caribbean region. We wish to\r\ncommend the secretariats of both bodies for the efforts\r\nthat have been made in this regard.\r\nThe member States of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean Group welcome this cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Caribbean Community, which is\r\nan important subregional grouping within the Latin\r\nAmerica and Caribbean region. The cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Caribbean Community has\r\nbeen and will be conducted in accordance with their\r\nrespective mandates, competence and composition, and\r\nshould be tailored to each specific situation, in conformity\r\nwith the Charter.\r\nThe consultations between the Secretaries-General of\r\nthe United Nations and of CARICOM and the\r\nparticipation of officials of both organizations in\r\nimportant meetings of the two bodies have without doubt\r\nassisted in strengthening the links between the United\r\nNations and the Caribbean Community.\r\nAs the report rightly recognizes, the increasing\r\ncomplexity of international relations has led the United\r\nNations to place a premium on cooperation and\r\ncoordination at the regional level. In this context, it\r\nemphasized that the United Nations attaches utmost\r\nimportance to building ever-closer ties with CARICOM,\r\nand took note of its member States’ contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Haiti. The member States of\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean are encouraged by this\r\ncommitment and are agreed that close collaboration of\r\nthis nature will be of real benefit to the organizations,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nand, more importantly, to the peoples of the Caribbean\r\nregion.\r\nThe report notes the subjects that the Caribbean\r\nCommunity’s Standing Committee of Ministers Responsible\r\nfor Foreign Affairs has proposed to be areas of joint pursuit\r\nbetween the United Nations and CARICOM. These include:\r\nfollow-up to global conferences such as the Rio summit and\r\nthe Barbados Conference on the sustainable development of\r\nsmall island developing States; the proposal for a new\r\nglobal human order; issues related to the law of the sea;\r\nfollow-up and implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nfor small island developing States; cooperation in the\r\ndevelopment of poverty- reduction programmes; peace-\r\nkeeping; diplomatic training; governance and development\r\nin the Caribbean, and strengthening of the Regional\r\nSecretariat Information Base. These all are important items\r\nwhich we believe should be given careful attention.\r\nThe extensive report of initiatives undertaken within\r\nthe region by various funds and programmes of the United\r\nNations system, including the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP) and the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), is also\r\nencouraging. Of special note are the programmes intended\r\nto assist in improving the quality of life of children and in\r\naddressing problems related to disaster relief, development,\r\nwomen’s issues and trade.\r\nThe Latin American and Caribbean Group takes note\r\nalso of the attention paid to the relationship between\r\nCARICOM and the specialized agencies.\r\nTaken in their totality, all these initiatives can\r\ncontribute positively to improving the ability of the United\r\nNations and CARICOM to work together for the benefit of\r\nthe peoples of the Caribbean and in furthering the\r\ninternational goals of peace, security, and development, to\r\nwhich the United Nations is committed.\r\nI therefore welcome this report on behalf of the\r\nmember States of the Latin American and Caribbean Group\r\nand call for the adoption by consensus of the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/51/L.14/Rev.1, as orally\r\nrevised, entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Caribbean Community”.\r\nMr. Hormel (United States of America): May I begin\r\nby expressing the condolences of the United States to the\r\npeople of India in connection with the destruction and the\r\ntragic loss of life that they have suffered.\r\nThe United States is pleased to cosponsor this draft\r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM). We support our\r\nfriends and neighbours, the member States of CARICOM,\r\nin their call for a closer working relationship with the\r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations is not only a forum\r\nfor individual Member States, but also a resource for\r\nregional organizations and arrangements. CARICOM is a\r\nregional leader, encompassing 14 States and millions of\r\npeople. It showed leadership recently in its support for the\r\nUnited Nations-authorized peacekeeping missions in Haiti\r\nthat restored peace to the region and supported democracy\r\nin the hemisphere.\r\nSince the formation of CARICOM in 1973, the\r\norganization has worked to improve and integrate the\r\neconomies and political structures of the Caribbean —\r\nbettering the lives of its people. The United States has\r\nsupported CARICOM’s efforts, and will continue to do\r\nso. CARICOM’s efforts to increase trade and investment\r\nand to promote sustainable development among its\r\nmembers are laudable.\r\nCARICOM is also showing leadership through its\r\nefforts to work closely with the United Nations in the\r\nareas of development, environmental protection, drug\r\ncontrol, and the promotion of the welfare of children.\r\nCoordination of efforts among nations makes programmes\r\nmore effective and helps guard against duplication of\r\neffort. We support this draft resolution and CARICOM’s\r\ncontinued goal of bringing the region’s Governments\r\ntogether, helping these dynamic nations to secure a better\r\nfuture for their citizens.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): Allow me first to join other\r\ndelegations in expressing our condolences to the\r\ndelegation of India on the loss of so many lives in the\r\nrecent cyclone.\r\nThe German delegation of course fully associates\r\nitself with the statement of the Permanent Representative\r\nof Ireland on behalf of the European Union. Germany,\r\nhowever, would like to take this opportunity to underline\r\nthe importance we attach to the discussion and solution of\r\nthe problems, the interests and the positions of small\r\nisland States in general and the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) in particular in the forums of the United\r\nNations.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nGermany is ready to cooperate even more closely with\r\nall Caribbean States on a wide range of topics, from\r\nenhancing private investment in this region to\r\nenvironmental protection. The protection of the environment\r\nis an important part of German foreign policy. In this\r\nrespect, we are convinced that solutions and aid to the\r\nspecific problems of small countries, such as the\r\nCARICOM member States, can only be based on\r\ncooperation on equal terms and on a process of mutual\r\nrespect and understanding. We will never allow ready-made\r\nsolutions to be imposed on small and fragile countries.\r\nOver the past year the CARICOM countries, we note\r\nwith regret, have often been affected by environmental\r\ncatastrophes, such as the recent hurricane, with devastating\r\neffects. Germany was able to provide assistance to the\r\nvictims of these situations. Since June of this year alone we\r\nhave granted DM 6.5 million in bilateral emergency aid to\r\nthe Caribbean Community. Important as this emergency\r\nassistance is, however, it is obvious that we need more\r\nlong-lasting solutions. Therefore, Germany wants to assist\r\nthe Caribbean Community further in establishing an\r\neffective early warning system to help create protective\r\nmechanisms which are vital to save lives and to prevent the\r\nworst consequences in the future.\r\nThe German Foreign Office has financed a study on\r\nearly warning systems for the Caribbean region. Climate\r\nchange has become a vital issue for the CARICOM\r\ncountries, as for other island countries. The German\r\nGovernment is aware of the fact that the industrialized\r\nnations bear a great responsibility in this regard. Therefore,\r\ntogether with the small island States, including CARICOM,\r\nwe intend to adopt a mandatory protocol on the reduction\r\nof carbon dioxide emissions. Since the second session of\r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in July this\r\nyear, the chances to adopt such a protocol have\r\nsignificantly improved.\r\nIn our view, the year 1997 will have a decisive\r\ninfluence on the development of environmental protection\r\nworldwide. Germany will make clear that it sees its\r\nresponsibility when we meet next year in the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development and prepare for the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly to take stock of how we\r\nhave implemented the mandate that was formulated five\r\nyears ago in Rio de Janeiro by our Heads of State and\r\nGovernment. The special session of the General Assembly\r\nwill have to find as concrete as possible an answer, to the\r\nquestion of what we have achieved since the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\n(UNCED) on our common path to sustainable,\r\neconomically efficient, socially balanced and ecologically\r\nsound development. In the context of the special session,\r\nwe would like to propose a special discussion dedicated\r\nto the progress achieved by implementing the Declaration\r\nof Barbados.\r\nThe 1994 Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States held in\r\nBarbados, in which my Government actively participated,\r\nnot only generated international awareness for the\r\nsituation of this specific group of developing States, but\r\nalso brought us the Declaration of Barbados, a\r\nprogramme of action which we endorse.\r\nGermany can build on its own experience when it\r\ncomes to implementing the Rio de Janeiro Conventions\r\non Climate Change and on Biological Diversity, as well\r\nas the United Nations Convention to Combat\r\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\r\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa.\r\nDuring the relevant negotiations, Germany has\r\nconsistently played a particularly active role and made\r\nsure that the just interests of other partners in the South,\r\nespecially in the Caribbean Community, namely their\r\neconomic and social development, will be taken into\r\naccount in the context of the common task of the\r\nprotection of our global environment.\r\nMy country looks forward to continued cooperation\r\nwith all CARICOM countries, together with our partners\r\nand within the framework of the European Union. That is\r\nwhy we are sponsoring, together with the other European\r\nUnion countries, the draft resolution on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me to begin by extending to the people\r\nand Government of India Argentina’s solidarity with them\r\nfollowing the natural disaster they suffered recently.\r\nArgentina is taking the floor to show its support for\r\nstrengthening cooperation between the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) and the United Nations. We are\r\ngrateful to the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/51/299). In our opinion, his recommendations are\r\nappropriate insofar as they lay down a suitable frame of\r\nreference for strengthening that cooperation.\r\nThis initiative reflects the important role CARICOM\r\ncountries play in the Organization and their commitment\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nto strengthening international peace and security and\r\npromoting sustainable human development.\r\nThe consolidation of democracy in the region, which\r\nhas always found inspiration in CARICOM, has been\r\nsignificantly strengthened by developments in Haiti. In this\r\ncontext, we appreciate the work of the United Nations and\r\nits Member States, and in particular the contribution made\r\nby CARICOM to the United Nations presence in Haiti.\r\nWe also wish to point to the dynamism and presence\r\nof the Caribbean countries in efforts to promote the\r\nagreements reached at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) held at Rio de\r\nJaneiro.\r\nWe share the concern of the countries of the region\r\nover the effects of climate change on our environment. If\r\nprogress is not made in these negotiations, the island States\r\nof the Caribbean and of other regions will be particularly\r\naffected. This is why we believe that we need to finalize a\r\nsatisfactory agreement within the context of the Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change in order to avert major\r\ndamage.\r\nIn this context, it is also particularly important to\r\nimplement the commitments made at the Barbados Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States. We hope that due emphasis is placed on\r\nthe particular situation of these countries within the\r\nframework of the review of the Rio de Janeiro agreements.\r\nIt is in a spirit of solidarity and with concern that we\r\nnote that the region is periodically affected by various kinds\r\nof natural disasters. Action by the international community\r\nin this connection — and particularly by the United\r\nNations — to reduce the damage caused by hurricanes\r\ndeserves particular mention. We nevertheless believe that\r\nonce a crisis situation is resolved, international attention\r\ndeclines and proves insufficient to meet the needs of\r\nrebuilding damaged infrastructures. This is something we\r\nshould change.\r\nArgentina participates in reconstruction efforts through\r\nits deployment of “White Helmets” to various countries of\r\nthe region. More specifically, Argentina, through the\r\nHorizontal Cooperation Fund, has channelled resources to\r\nthe Caribbean to cooperate in the sustainable human\r\ndevelopment of that region. More than 30 cooperation\r\nprojects are currently under way in areas as diverse as\r\nagricultural training, poverty eradication, State reform and\r\nprivatization.\r\nRegional cooperation, in conjunction with\r\ncooperation between the various regional organizations\r\nand the United Nations, is one of the mechanisms we\r\nhave available to eliminate the universal problems that\r\naffect international peace and security and the viable\r\ndevelopment of future generations.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to say a few words about how\r\nwe in Argentina feel about the countries of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM). These countries are a great\r\ncredit to the United Nations, as they are to the\r\nOrganization of American States. Since joining the\r\nagencies of the hemisphere they have brought new\r\napproaches and a flexible and positive spirit to efforts to\r\nsolve regional problems. The work of CARICOM’s\r\nrepresentatives in the Commission on Human Rights, to\r\nmention but one example, is a clear example of what I\r\nam saying.\r\nHowever, there is more. The countries of CARICOM\r\nhave shown and continue to show that good governance\r\nand pluralistic democracy are perfectly compatible with\r\nefforts towards sustainable development, and that it does\r\nnot matter if one has small sectoral economies when those\r\nwho administer them are sensitive to the needs of their\r\npeoples.\r\nMr. Ferrarin (Italy): I wish to fully associate\r\nmyself with the statement made by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Ireland, Ambassador John Campbell, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. His words represent the\r\ncommon position to which my country contributed, along\r\nwith all the other partners.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to add some\r\nobservations that Italy wishes to underline. Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) is a particularly successful case\r\nin the wider framework of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. Italy was one\r\nof the sponsors of the draft resolution (A/51/L.14/Rev.1)\r\nbecause of the positive results of this cooperation and\r\nbecause of the emphasis it has given to economic\r\ndevelopment and the affirmation of democracy in the\r\nCARICOM area.\r\nThe economic and social development of all\r\nCARICOM countries must be one of the main priorities\r\nof United Nations initiatives, together with the\r\nenhancement of their capacity to be active participants in\r\nand contributors to United Nations activities.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nThe entry into force of the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and the establishment of\r\nthe International Seabed Authority in Kingston are two\r\nexamples of the development of international law and of the\r\nvalorizing of economic resources that directly interest these\r\nisland States.\r\nThe characteristics of the CARICOM region and the\r\nimportance of its development are among the prime reasons\r\nfor Italy’s active promotion of European Union cooperation\r\nand partnership with the small island developing States, and\r\nfor its contribution to the follow-up of the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States two years ago. Italy believes that the\r\ninternational community should take stock of the invaluable\r\nexperience that the small island States have accrued in\r\nmany sectors.\r\nIn the context of the Lomé Convention, during the\r\nmeeting of the Council of Ministers of the European Union\r\nand the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States in\r\nMauritius, Italy made every effort to prevent major changes\r\nto the list of less developed countries and to draw greater\r\nattention to the difficulties, in the event of natural\r\ncatastrophes, of countries removed from the list.\r\nDuring its term as President of the European Union,\r\nItaly supported the desire of the Caribbean States to start a\r\npolitical dialogue. This proposal was made at the Kingston\r\nsession, which allowed for an exchange of views that went\r\nwell beyond a mere survey of regional issues. Italy hopes\r\nthat a structural framework will be given to this dialogue in\r\nthe future. In the long process involved in the renewal of\r\nthe Convention, Italy will be supportive of the needs of the\r\nCaribbean community, as it has been in the past.\r\nItaly is studying a series of development initiatives in\r\nthe field of environmental protection and new and\r\nrenewable sources of energy. These initiatives will be\r\nimplemented through the United Nations system in\r\nconformity with the principles of sustainable human\r\ndevelopment agreed on in Copenhagen.\r\nToday’s draft resolution takes note of the special role\r\nplayed by the States Members of the Caribbean Community\r\nin the restoration of democracy in Haiti. The United\r\nNations has played an essential role in returning democracy\r\nto this country, and we believe that it must continue to be\r\npresent in order to strengthen in the short term and the long\r\nterm the country’s stability, the security of its citizens,\r\nrespect for human rights and economic development. Only\r\nstability and security can give the necessary confidence to\r\ninvestors. We will therefore continue to do our part in the\r\nproper United Nations bodies, including the General\r\nAssembly, to promote and support the United Nations\r\npresence in Haiti.\r\nItaly, which is tied to many countries of CARICOM\r\nby long-standing bonds of friendship and culture, will\r\ncontinue to follow with great attention this area of United\r\nNations action.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 46/8 of 16 October 1991, I now call\r\non the Observer for the Caribbean Community.\r\nMr. Blake (Caribbean Community (CARICOM)): I\r\nwish to express the heartfelt sympathy of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity to the Government and people of India for\r\nthe loss of life and property incurred as a result of the\r\nrecent cyclone. We well understand their loss.\r\nI am honoured to represent the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) as members of this organ join\r\nin support of the draft resolution entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity”.\r\nThe Caribbean Community, as an integration\r\nmovement of small States, the overwhelming majority of\r\nwhich are small island developing States, places very\r\ngreat reliance on multilateral systems and rules. The\r\nUnited Nations has succeeded over its 50 years in\r\nbuilding systems that simultaneously recognize the\r\nsovereign equality of States and differences in the natural\r\nendowments and economic capacity of States.\r\nCARICOM was established by the Treaty of\r\nChaguaramas on 4 July l973 with the fundamental\r\nobjectives of, first, promoting and facilitating economic\r\ndevelopment, thereby improving well-being and reducing\r\npoverty and unemployment; secondly, strengthening and\r\ncoordinating the interface of the small States of the\r\nCaribbean with the international community; and, third,\r\npromoting, through cooperation, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment and the preservation of these. The processes\r\ncontinue with increasing intensity and urgency to cope\r\nwith the pace of global development and change.\r\nWithin CARICOM, priority has been given to\r\ndeepening the economic integration process through the\r\ncreation of a single market and economy before the year\r\n2000. The single market will maintain the openness of the\r\nregion to international trade and investment. The process\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nhas therefore focused on completion of the internal free\r\nmarket for goods; freeing the market for the movement of\r\ncapital and investment and for the provision of services,\r\nincluding labour services, beginning with skilled labour;\r\nand facilitating and encouraging factor movements through\r\nmeasures such as the harmonization and transferability of\r\nsocial security benefits and the avoidance of double\r\ntaxation. It has also focused on implementing a competitive\r\ncommon external tariff for imports from the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe second objective is to organize the institutional\r\nand human capacity for more effective participation and\r\nengagement in hemispheric and global developments. In\r\nthis regard, there is a Prime Ministerial subcommittee of the\r\nConference of Heads of Government of CARICOM which\r\nhas the responsibility of prioritizing and coordinating the\r\nregion’s position on external economic issues and\r\nnegotiating on behalf of the region.\r\nThe third objective is to increase the involvement of\r\ncivil society. In this regard, a Caribbean Community charter\r\nof civil society, having been the subject of broad-based\r\nconsultation, is now in the final stages of approval. The\r\nHeads of Government of the Caribbean Community have\r\nalso set in train plans for a regional, broad-based\r\nconference on social and economic development, which will\r\nbe held in 1997. This conference will build on the results\r\nof the various United Nations global conferences and on\r\ninitiatives in the region over the past five years.\r\nThe Caribbean Community has continued to give high\r\npriority to relations with neighbours in the Caribbean. In\r\nthis regard, it admitted Suriname to full membership to the\r\nCommunity in mid-1995; Suriname began to function as a\r\nmember of the Common Market on 1 January 1996. The\r\nCaribbean Community spearheaded the operationalization\r\nof the Association of Caribbean States in 1995 and\r\ncontinued its support for the strengthening of democratic\r\ninstitutions, the maintenance of peace and the building of\r\nthe economic and social infrastructure in Haiti. The\r\nCaribbean Community seeks the cooperation of the\r\ninternational community in keeping the Caribbean Sea,\r\nwhich unites all the countries of the Caribbean basin, safe\r\nand free from the threats of hazardous materials and waste.\r\nThe granting to the Caribbean Community of observer\r\nstatus to the United Nations General Assembly on 16\r\nOctober 1991 was an important boost not only to regional\r\nintegration, but to cooperation between the Community and\r\nthe various United Nations organizations and bodies. It\r\nstimulated, for example, the adoption of resolution 49/141,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community” on 20 December 1994 and the\r\nsigning of a memorandum of understanding in January\r\n1995 between the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity. It has encouraged, even in the face of rapidly\r\ndeclining resources to the region, a number of critical\r\ncooperation initiatives with various United Nations\r\nagencies.\r\nI would, by way of example and given the elaborate\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, refer to, first, the\r\ninitiative of the ECLAC and CARICOM to monitor and\r\npromote action to implement the Programme of Action\r\nadopted by the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States;\r\nsecondly, the initiative of the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund and CARICOM in relation to health and family life\r\neducation; thirdly, the initiative of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development to set up a trust\r\nfund to facilitate enterprise, education and development in\r\nthe Caribbean; and, fourth, the support of UNDP for the\r\nCaribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency and its\r\nresponse to the frequent natural disasters that plague the\r\nregion.\r\nThe draft resolution before the General Assembly\r\ntoday will further strengthen the resolve of various\r\nagencies of the United Nations system to work\r\ncooperatively with the Caribbean Community as it seeks\r\nto promote integration and sustainable development and\r\nto strengthen its productive and institutional capacity to\r\nparticipate effectively in the global economy. It will also\r\nencourage the United Nations itself to focus directly on\r\nthe special vulnerabilities and the security of the small\r\nStates, individually and in the Caribbean region as a\r\nwhole. In this regard, the Caribbean Community\r\nanticipates that the review of the follow-up of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\nand other global conferences, which will be undertaken in\r\n1997; will focus specifically on the Global Conference on\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island States and\r\nprovide priorities for future cooperative action.\r\nThe Caribbean Community supports the draft\r\nresolution, which reinforces the tradition and history of\r\ncooperation between the Caribbean Community and the\r\nUnited Nations. We therefore thank members for this\r\nopportunity, as an observer organization, to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 11 November 1996\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. We shall now proceed\r\nto consider draft resolution A/51/L.14/Rev.1, as orally\r\nrevised.\r\nI call on the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Perfiliev (Director, General Assembly Affairs\r\nDivision): Should the General Assembly decide to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/51/L.14/Rev.1 as orally revised, by its\r\noperative paragraph 7, it would recommend that the first\r\ngeneral meeting between representatives of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity and its associated institutions and of the United\r\nNations system be held in 1997 for the purpose of holding\r\nconsultations on projects, measures and procedures to\r\nfacilitate and strengthen cooperation between those\r\norganizations.\r\nIt is assumed that the meeting would be held in New\r\nYork for one or two days on dates to be determined during\r\n1997. There would be no simultaneous interpretation.\r\nDocumentation consisting of 30 to 50 pages pre-session, 10\r\nto 20 pages in-session and 24 pages post-session would be\r\nissued in English only.\r\nOn this basis, the proposed meeting would be\r\naccommodated without giving rise to additional\r\nexpenditures under section 26E of the programme budget\r\nfor the biennium 1996-1997.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolution A/51/L.14/Rev.1, as orally\r\nrevised.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to announce that since\r\nthe introduction of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/51/L.14/Rev.1, as orally revised: France, Germany and\r\nNepal.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/51/L.14/Rev.1, as orally revised?\r\nDraft resolution A/51/L.14/Rev.1, as orally revised,\r\nwas adopted (resolution A/51/16).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 25?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members of\r\nthe following changes. Agenda item 26, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization”, originally\r\nscheduled for this morning as the third item, is postponed\r\nto a later date to be announced.\r\nAgenda item 56, entitled “The situation in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina”, which was scheduled as the second\r\nitem for the morning of Tuesday, 12 November, is also\r\npostponed to a later date to be announced.\r\nAgenda item 30, entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States”, which\r\nwas scheduled as the first item in the morning of\r\nThursday, 14 November, will be considered on Tuesday,\r\n19 November, in the morning, as the fourth item.\r\nNext, I should like to inform members that on\r\nWednesday, 20 November, in the morning, the Assembly\r\nwill take up sub-item (h) of agenda item 18, entitled\r\n“Appointment of members of the Joint Inspection Unit”,\r\nas the first item. Agenda item 41, entitled “Support by the\r\nUnited Nations system of the efforts of Governments to\r\npromote and consolidate new or restored democracies”,\r\nalready scheduled for that morning, will therefore be the\r\nsecond item.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.50 p.m.\r\n16\r\n"
