(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of\r\nthe Republic of Colombia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of\r\nthe Republic of Colombia, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Samper Pizano (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you\r\non your election as President of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I salute you in my capacity as Chairman\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, which has found in your\r\nbackground a close identity with the defence of the interests\r\nof the developing countries. The same is true of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who\r\nhonoured us with his attendance at the last Non-Aligned\r\nMovement summit, held at Cartagena de Indias.\r\nOver the past several years in Colombia, we have been\r\nwaging a difficult war against drug trafficking. In that\r\nbattle, judges, police officers, journalists and innocent\r\ncivilians have lost their lives: more than 20,000 people in\r\nthe last 10 years. In fact, last week in the southern part of\r\nthe country more than 50 soldiers of the Colombia army\r\nwho were destroying illicit crops and cocaine processing\r\nlaboratories in the jungle region were massacred by\r\nguerrillas engaged in the defence of drug trafficking\r\ninterests. The mother of one of those murdered young\r\nmen — a 17-year-old soldier — asked me the following\r\nday with tears in her eyes: “Why”?\r\nAllow me today to try to answer that mother and all\r\nthose who have been victims of this war, not only in\r\nColombia, but around the world. Values, democracy and\r\nnational security are threatened. We are waging this war\r\nto preserve and protect those values; to protect and\r\npreserve our youth and our democratic form of\r\ngovernment; but above all to protect our national security.\r\nNo country in the world must ignore the battle against\r\ndrugs. This war is occurring today in every country,\r\nowing to the broad power of powerful international\r\ncriminal and terrorist organizations which have extended\r\ntheir tentacles over the entire planet.\r\nNow that the cold war has ended, the United Nations\r\nand the world must design and develop a strategy to put\r\nan immediate end to the greatest threat to the world’s\r\nsecurity and stability today: the threat of drugs. It is an\r\nepidemic that, more than any other war, can undermine\r\nthe value structure which supports the governability of\r\ndemocratic systems.\r\nAs we prepare for the twenty-first century, I invite\r\nall world leaders present or represented here today, to a\r\ncollective and above all sincere reflection on this\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nproposal, which Colombia presents with the moral authority\r\nit has been granted, having been the nation which has\r\nsuffered most, which has invested most, and which has paid\r\nthe highest social and economic costs in this struggle\r\nagainst drug trafficking.\r\nIn recent years, Colombia has spent 14 times more\r\nresources fighting drug trafficking than what is invested\r\nannually by the international community through the United\r\nNations system for the same purpose. Thanks to this\r\ndetermined effort, Colombia has been able to avoid the\r\nannual distribution throughout the world of more than\r\n6 billion doses intended for drug users.\r\nI, too, have been a victim of drug trafficking. Several\r\nyears ago I was the target of an assassination attempt that\r\nalmost cost me my life. I received 11 bullet wounds, and\r\nstill carry four bullets in my body. More recently I fell\r\nvictim to another assassination attempt, this time of a moral\r\nnature. I was accused of having allowed money from a\r\ncartel to infiltrate my campaign. Despite that, from the very\r\nfirst day of my Administration we have worked\r\nsuccessfully to arrest the criminals and completely destroy\r\nthe powerful Cali cartel.\r\nI thank God that I survived that assault too. The\r\nCongress of the Republic of Colombia, which, under our\r\nConstitution is the judge of the President, completely\r\nexonerated me of all charges after a long trial that I\r\npersonally requested be held in public. Barely 48 hours ago,\r\nbefore coming to the Assembly, I was the victim of yet\r\nanother attempt. Heroin was smuggled onto my aeroplane\r\nin order to shame Colombia and its democratic\r\nGovernment. This new attempt proved that the criminal\r\norganizations have the power and the capability to penetrate\r\nalmost every institution in our society, anywhere in the\r\nworld. However, I stand here today, before this world\r\nAssembly of democracy, with complete dignity because\r\nnobody will stop me from presenting to the world\r\nColombia’s proposals to deal with the drug organizations.\r\nI am speaking to the Assembly today bearing the\r\npainful scars of those encounters. Similar scars are borne\r\nby all Colombians who have been physically injured by\r\ndrug terrorism or morally wounded by international\r\nmisunderstanding. I am not here to complain; I am here to\r\npropose a solution to this modern-day epidemic. I am\r\nconvinced that the world is losing the war against drugs.\r\nThe solution will have to be as global as the problem itself.\r\nIt will have to be as swift and irreversible as the damage\r\nthat drugs and crime are causing to the minds of the young\r\ndrug users of the world.\r\nThe achievements of Colombia and other countries\r\ndo not imply that the problem of drug trafficking has\r\nbeen eradicated throughout the world. The drug problem\r\nwill be resolved only when all countries, without\r\nexception and without hypocrisy, shoulder their own\r\nresponsibilities, which cannot be delegated to others.\r\nTo achieve this, we must set out the parameters for\r\na great anti-drug alliance, which include immediate and\r\ndecisive action. If we do not accomplish this, drug\r\ntrafficking, the most sinister transnational enterprise in the\r\nworld, whose resources equal $500 billion per year —\r\nmore than those of the world-wide petroleum industry —\r\nwill continue to corrupt and contaminate our peoples.\r\nThe statistics on international action to date are not\r\nvery encouraging. Drug use continues to increase under\r\nthe tolerant attitudes of some Governments, and the level\r\nof drug seizures and confiscation barely exceeds 10 per\r\ncent of the total of such drugs circulating in the world. In\r\nthe face of this demoralizing reality we have only two\r\nalternatives: mutual recrimination, or cooperation. Either\r\nwe continue to criticize each other, or we work together.\r\nMultilateral focus on the problem is the only alternative;\r\ninterventionism is not the way. The only end that\r\nunilateral or interventionist measures achieve, as we have\r\nseen recently, is to break mutual trust, weaken the ability\r\nof Governments to take action, and open the way for the\r\nconsolidation of criminal organizations.\r\nColombia proposes an agenda of global action\r\nagainst drugs, based on the principles of shared\r\nresponsibility, equality and an integrated approach: shared\r\nresponsibility, because we are all responsible for the\r\nproblem of ethical, political, social and economic\r\ncontamination produced by drug trafficking throughout\r\nthe world; equality, because no country should assume the\r\nright to judge the conduct of another on a subject that\r\ninvolves the responsibility of all on standards of\r\nbehaviour that are worldwide and collective; and\r\nintegration, because every phase of the process — from\r\nagricultural production, to industrial processing, transport,\r\ndistribution, consumption, and money laundering — must\r\nbe addressed simultaneously, and with the same energy.\r\nColombia wants to be part of the solution. We do\r\nnot want to continue to be demonized by the world when,\r\nin fact, we are victims, as all peoples are. The issues for\r\nthe global agenda against drugs are as follows: first, with\r\nregard to the establishment of a social machinery for the\r\neradication of illegal crops, it is not enough to eradicate\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nsuch crops if we are not capable of offering alternative\r\nsolutions for small peasant farmers.\r\nColombia endorses the innovative proposal of French\r\nPresident Jacques Chirac to create a mechanism to enable\r\nthe purchase of produce grown as alternatives for illegal\r\ncrops at prices that closely approximate those paid for coca,\r\nopium poppies and marijuana. The establishment of this\r\nmechanism should be accompanied by a commitment to\r\naerial and manual eradication over five years, which would\r\nlead to the elimination of these illicit crops throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nSecondly, we need controls on the trafficking of\r\nchemical precursors and weapons, which are speeding drug\r\ntrafficking and the violence that it generates. The United\r\nNations system must define, within the framework of the\r\nVienna Convention, specific guidelines to regulate the pre-\r\nshipment certification of chemical precursors to\r\ndrug-producing countries, and contribute to producing\r\neffective systems to control arms sales to those same\r\ndestinations.\r\nAs regards a mandate to combat money laundering,\r\nonly decisive action against the profits generated by the\r\ndrug business can stop the recycling of these resources into\r\nproduction and distribution centres. Eighty per cent of drug\r\ntrafficking money circulates through the economic and\r\nfinancial channels of the industrialized nations. We need\r\nmuch stricter controls on the banking system and on\r\nindustries whose smuggling of goods and services are being\r\nused to launder this drug money.\r\nWe propose that the mandate of the European\r\nagreement governing money laundering, investigation,\r\nseizure and forfeiture of assets derived from drug\r\ntrafficking be extended to the global level. Concurrently, we\r\nshould expand globally those decisions reached at the\r\nWorld Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational\r\nCrime held at Naples in 1994.\r\nAs regards a worldwide intelligence centre for\r\ncooperation in operations against cartels and drug\r\ntrafficking networks, we believe that in dealing with\r\ninternational crime which starts in one place, continues in\r\nanother and ends at the point of consumption, the combined\r\naction of all countries is required to develop the necessary\r\nintelligence and police operations to seize shipments,\r\ndismantle networks and pursue domestic drug dealers and\r\ndistributors. Colombia proposes such an organization of a\r\nworldwide intelligence centre against drugs. This centre\r\nwould coordinate the collection of evidence from every\r\npolice force in the world to fight the unified multinational\r\ndrug traffickers with an equally unified response.\r\nAs regards programmes which effectively curb\r\ndemand, statistics worryingly show that consumption is\r\ngrowing, not declining, and that it is doing so in the most\r\nvulnerable sectors of our society: among young people\r\nand ethnic minorities. Unless we curb demand, the task of\r\nfighting supply will be ineffective in achieving a\r\ndefinitive solution to the problem.\r\nOne cannot place the entire burden of drug fighting\r\non drug-producing countries, which are the weakest link.\r\nWe are speaking of a market that must be controlled from\r\nboth sides. Starting with an agreement on the goals for\r\nthe reduction of consumption, we propose the adoption of\r\nan integrated plan that includes prevention campaigns,\r\naction by non-governmental organizations and public\r\nhealth initiatives accompanied by stricter laws against the\r\ndistribution and consumption of illegal drugs.\r\nFinally, we propose a world treaty of judicial\r\ncooperation in the war against drugs and terrorism which\r\nmust have no frontiers. Recognizing the sovereign right\r\nof every nation to apply justice in its own territory for\r\ncrimes committed within its boundaries, no nation should\r\nagree to be used as a refuge or sanctuary for organized\r\ncrime. Judicial reciprocity and assistance in the exchange\r\nof evidence, the criminalization and judicial seizure of\r\nassets derived from drug trafficking and terrorism,\r\nextradition and the creation of high-security prisons with\r\nstandards subject to international monitoring must be an\r\nintegral part of this strategy.\r\nWithout undermining bilateral or regional\r\nagreements, these judicial cooperation agreements would\r\nestablish the basis for the eventual formation of an\r\ninternational tribunal against organized crime. Signatory\r\ncountries would submit international criminals such as\r\narms dealers, drug traffickers, money launderers and\r\nterrorists to the jurisdiction of this tribunal according to\r\nthe terms of their participation agreements.\r\nColombia proposes to this Assembly the formation\r\nof a group of experts who would be charged with\r\ndeveloping a timetable and action plan for this proposed\r\nglobal agenda for the war against drugs. An initial review\r\nof the group’s progress could be made at the 1998 special\r\nsession of the General Assembly which has been\r\nproposed by the Government of Mexico. The group of\r\nexperts should be formed in four months’ time, and\r\nColombia will be pleased to host its first meeting. I call\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\non world leaders to communicate to Colombia their\r\nrecommendations on how best to organize the work of this\r\ngroup of experts.\r\nThe globalization of problems in today’s world is\r\ntaking place much faster than the globalization of solutions.\r\nTerrorism, and drugs and arms trafficking do not respect\r\neither national boundaries or barriers. Developing countries\r\nhave fewer opportunities and more limited resources to\r\nconfront the invasive power of these threats, in the face of\r\nwhich there are neither weak nor strong, only victims.\r\nI invoke the memory of those killed by these wars\r\nwhich will also exist in the next century. I invoke our\r\nchildren’s future, threatened by bombs, illegal drugs and\r\nguns. I invoke the plain cause of the coexistence of the\r\nworld in order to commit ourselves to this formidable task\r\nof blocking the path of organized crime which today\r\nchallenges our right to govern the world in peace. Finally,\r\nI invoke the tears of all the mothers and youths of the\r\nworld who have been sacrificed in the fight against drugs\r\nor through their use. May God illuminate our path that we\r\nmay continue this battle.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Colombia\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of Colombia,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral Debate\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nSir Julius Chan, KBE, GCMG, MP, Prime\r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea.\r\nSir Julius Chan, Prime Minister of Papua New\r\nGuinea, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nSir Julius Chan (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of\r\nthe people and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to preside\r\nover the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. The\r\nwarm relations that have developed between our two\r\nnations make it a particular pleasure to welcome you to\r\nyour high office and to wish you well in carrying out\r\nyour duties. I would also like to record our sincere\r\nappreciation for the wise leadership with which your\r\npredecessor guided our deliberations during the historic\r\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe rapid approach of the year 2000 raises the\r\nquestion whether — and how — we are going to try to\r\nmake the turn of the century a turning point for the\r\nUnited Nations. Despite the many thought-provoking\r\nspeeches made for the fiftieth anniversary, I regret to say\r\nthat signs of fundamental and far-reaching changes\r\nrequired remain elusive. Yet we live at a time when the\r\nonly constant factor is change. The preamble to its\r\nCharter makes it quite clear that the United Nations itself\r\nwas — and is — intended to be an agent of change. If\r\nour Organization is to remain relevant to the challenges\r\nahead, then it, and we the Members, must adapt and keep\r\non adapting, as the world continues to change.\r\nInvented to raise humanity’s sights beyond the\r\nhorizon of destruction caused by world war, the United\r\nNations must be continuously reinvented in order to play\r\nan effective role in a rapidly changing world. The United\r\nNations has in fact been successful at one kind of change:\r\nadding to our agenda responsibilities and activities in\r\nareas such as peacekeeping, peacemaking, human rights\r\nand sustainable development. It has, however, been very\r\nmuch less successful in rationalizing its operations and\r\nadministrative support.\r\nHumanity needs a much more focused, trim and vital\r\nUnited Nations. Without internal reform, the risk of\r\noverload is only too real — and, arguably, overload is\r\nalready here. Even more importantly, we, the Members of\r\nthe United Nations, have to do more, much more, to\r\nadapt key institutions to the changed and still-changing\r\ncircumstances of a post-colonial, post-cold-war world.\r\nAlmost everyone agrees what the main issues and\r\noptions are. Yet as far as its permanent membership goes,\r\nthe Security Council in particular remains, much as it has\r\nalways been, the product of decisions made before most\r\nMember States became independent. Some of the\r\nstrongest critics of the cost and alleged inefficiencies\r\nof the United Nations come from States that are among\r\nthe slowest in paying their membership dues. While\r\nthey criticize weaknesses in the Organization’s\r\nperformance, they are often among the most eager\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nadvocates of giving it new assignments. Their\r\nactions — and inaction — suggest that they confuse\r\ncutbacks in the resources available to the United Nations\r\nwith real reform.\r\nLike other members of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nPapua New Guinea is firmly committed to reforming the\r\nSecurity Council. While we recognize that those whom\r\nexisting arrangements most favour are well placed to delay\r\nor block change, we firmly believe that the Council’s\r\ncomposition should be altered. It must take better account\r\nof the geographical distribution and sovereign equality of\r\nMember States. Concerned that it seems to be taking longer\r\nto reform than it originally took to form the United Nations,\r\nPapua New Guinea’s voice and vote are emphatically for\r\nchange. We believe that the time for action is now.\r\nPapua New Guinea has embarked on an ambitious\r\nprogramme of domestic reforms, including both\r\nconstitutional and economic-policy changes. Having\r\nlegislated a new system of provincial and local-level\r\ngovernments in order to improve the delivery of services to\r\nour people, we are actively engaged in implementation.\r\nTwenty-one years after giving ourselves a “home-grown”\r\nConstitution, we are now engaged in a comprehensive\r\nprocess of reform that is equally “home-grown”.\r\nMy Government is just as determined to bring about\r\ncomprehensive structural adjustment. Following decisions\r\nto devalue and float our national currency, the kina, we are\r\nnow reducing the size of the public sector. We are making\r\nthe official interface with the private sector more\r\nbusiness-friendly and encouraging commercial enterprise.\r\nWhile international agencies and foreign aid donors provide\r\nvaluable support, the impulse, direction and pace of reform\r\nare emphatically Papua New Guinea’s own. Being a\r\nmember of the Government that led Papua New Guinea to\r\nits independence, I cannot allow our national sovereignty —\r\nor our Government’s ability to respond to our people’s\r\nneeds — to be compromised now.\r\nExperience of the difficulties of reform at home has\r\nreinforced my Government’s commitment to reforming the\r\nUnited Nations. The principles remain the same. We\r\nstrongly support efforts to ensure that the world has a truly\r\neffective, flexible and responsive Organization through\r\nwhich to cooperate in meeting the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe United Nations is founded on the idea that\r\nsecurity involves much more than military defence against\r\nthreats of armed attack. Conscious of the threats and\r\nlimitations on self-defence that we face together with\r\nother small island developing countries, Papua New\r\nGuinea has always regarded collective security as an\r\nimportant key to national security. Diplomacy is the\r\nmeans by which we seek to cooperate with all other\r\nStates committed to peace.\r\nAs the current Chairman of the Melanesian\r\nSpearhead Group (MSG), I am pleased to report that we\r\nwelcomed Fiji as a new member at our Summit in June.\r\nWe also adopted a document — “Melanesia Beyond\r\n2000” — which outlines our objectives and strategy for\r\nthe MSG’s second decade.\r\nWe have emphasized our commitment to cooperation\r\non a wide basis and have also agreed to a proposal on\r\nweapons control. The South Pacific Forum is developing\r\nthe idea on a region-wide basis. Following the extreme\r\noutrage that the South Pacific felt when France resumed\r\nits testing programme in French Polynesia last year, I can\r\nnow report that the programme has ceased. The remaining\r\nnuclear Powers with interests in our region — France, the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America —\r\nhave signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty\r\n(Treaty of Rarotonga). France has been readmitted as a\r\npost-Forum dialogue partner.\r\nAs much as we welcome the developments during\r\nthe past 12 months, Papua New Guinea believes that\r\nmore is required before our region can be described as\r\ngenuinely nuclear-free. Outstanding needs include a\r\nbroader treaty, systematic monitoring of former test-sites,\r\ncleaning up, compensation and the provision of alternative\r\nsources of income for the people of French Polynesia.\r\nThe Treaty of Rarotonga is complemented by the\r\nMSG’s Lakatoro Declaration on Denuclearization in\r\nOceania. Subregional and regional efforts are again\r\ncomplemented by similar arrangements negotiated during\r\nthe past year in South-East Asia and Africa, as well as by\r\nthe much older arrangements that apply to Antarctica and\r\nLatin America. Papua New Guinea welcomes the\r\nBrazilian proposal to link these arrangements into a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear-weapon-free zone covering the\r\nentire southern hemisphere. Having supported the recent\r\npassage of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nwe would now like to see it extended to outlawing\r\nsimulations, limiting the development and acquisition of\r\nnew nuclear weapons and, ultimately, bringing about\r\ncomplete disarmament.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nThe South Pacific Forum has expressed support for the\r\nearly conclusion of negotiations over a legal regime\r\ncovering civil liability for nuclear damage.\r\nCommitted to furthering cooperation against threats to\r\nour region, the South Pacific Forum is working on an\r\narrangement through which member States can respond to\r\nlegitimate requests for assistance from one another’s\r\ndisciplined services, including police. The same\r\narrangement could also be used for consultations intended\r\nto help prevent, manage and settle disputes. We continue to\r\nbroaden, deepen and diversify other areas of security\r\ncooperation, including law enforcement.\r\nConsistent with agreements reached at the regional\r\nlevel, Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive\r\ncode of logging practice designed to promote the\r\nsustainable use and in-country processing of a rich\r\nrenewable natural resource.\r\nWe are gravely concerned at the threat that climate\r\nchange poses to the very survival of low-lying atolls. Entire\r\ncountries in our region face the risk of extinction. Papua\r\nNew Guinea joins with other developing countries in calling\r\non the advanced industrialized countries to look beyond\r\ntheir immediate self-interest and adopt specific targets for\r\nreducing greenhouse emissions, an issue which generates\r\nconsiderable emotion among us.\r\nTogether with other coastal States in the region, we\r\nlook to distant-water fishing nations for cooperation in\r\ngiving effect to the United Nations Agreement on straddling\r\nfish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks so that it does\r\nnot weaken existing regional arrangements.\r\nIn the wider Asia-Pacific region, Papua New Guinea\r\ncalls for a reduction of avoidable sources of stress,\r\nuncertainty and risk on the Korean Peninsula, both for the\r\nsake of the countries directly involved and because of their\r\npotentially adverse effects on other countries.\r\nConcerned about events earlier in the year, I repeat\r\nlast year’s call for the United Nations to do its best to ease\r\nthe tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.\r\nImportant regional organizations in the Asia-Pacific have\r\nfound ways of following the principle within the region.\r\nThe European Parliament has adopted a resolution\r\nrecommending that the United Nations identify options for\r\nTaiwan to take part in the activities of bodies answerable to\r\nthe General Assembly. The United Nations has an\r\nobligation to assist in maintaining a secure environment in\r\nwhich economic growth and other forms of development\r\ncan continue for the benefit of the peoples of the region\r\nas well as their partners around the world. It is therefore\r\ntime to address the question of Taiwanese participation in\r\ninstitutions and processes set up to further the universal\r\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter.\r\nRespect for the national sovereignty of Member\r\nStates is basic to the United Nations Charter. Small island\r\ndeveloping countries tend to be especially vulnerable to\r\na wide range of possible threats. Their development, and\r\neven their very survival, often depend on international\r\ncooperation and law.\r\nHaving achieved national independence under United\r\nNations supervision, Papua New Guinea is firmly\r\ncommitted to the United Nations Special Committee on\r\nthe Situation With Regard to the Implementation of the\r\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial\r\nCountries and Peoples. Despite criticism from certain\r\nquarters, we were therefore pleased to welcome and host\r\nthe Special Committee’s regional seminar held in Port\r\nMoresby in June. Together with all other members of the\r\nMelanesian Spearhead Group and the South Pacific\r\nForum, we remain firmly committed to the orderly\r\ndecolonization of New Caledonia, with special safeguards\r\nfor the indigenous Kanaks. We will not accept illegitimate\r\nattempts to delay or derail complete implementation of\r\nthe Matignon Agreements. Having reviewed the French\r\nGovernment’s record elsewhere in the region, we ask\r\nourselves whether French Polynesia, as well as Walis and\r\nFutuna, should be included in the United Nations list of\r\nNon-Self-Governing Territories. The international\r\ncommunity has a duty to see that France meets its\r\nresponsibilities to the people of our region and a prime\r\nresponsibility must be the right of self-determination.\r\nOn Bougainville, my Government is firmly\r\ncommitted to doing all that we can to resolve the crisis\r\nthat has racked the Bougainville Province in my country\r\nsince 1989. I therefore negotiated a cease-fire, arranged\r\na regional peacekeeping force and agreed to peace talks\r\nin October 1994, only to find that the militant leaders\r\nwould not honour the agreements reached. Even so, my\r\nGovernment has been prepared to talk to those who will\r\ntalk to us. We have established the Bougainville\r\nTransitional Government and continue to provide\r\nprotection for people forced to flee from their homes by\r\nthe criminal actions of an armed and militant minority.\r\nWe continue to restore services and to encourage\r\nreconciliation, but the mounting toll of destruction, injury\r\nand loss of life caused by the militants gave the National\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nGovernment no alternative but to lift the ceasefire on 21\r\nMarch this year.\r\nEven now, rival gangs of armed criminals continue to\r\nthreaten the lives of innocent people, trying to destroy what\r\nthe people, provincial leaders and the national Government\r\nare doing and reconstructing. They undermine all efforts to\r\nmaintain the rule of law. In a particularly barbaric attack on\r\n8 September this year, 12 members of our security forces\r\nwere killed at the Kangu Care Centre in South\r\nBougainville.\r\nDespite the worst efforts of the Bougainville\r\nRevolutionary Army and its sympathizers abroad, my\r\nGovernment is standing firm. We will not give them the\r\nsatisfaction of departing from our basic objective of\r\nrestoring peace and rebuilding all they have destroyed.\r\nWe appreciate the understanding displayed by the\r\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights when it\r\nconsidered the Bougainville situation earlier this year. It has\r\nalways been a complex domestic issue. In keeping with the\r\nmutual respect for national sovereignty that is basic to\r\ninternational law, Papua New Guinea calls on all other\r\nStates to refrain from statements and actions that send\r\nmisleading signals to those who violate our laws; to\r\ncooperate in preventing smuggling and other illegal\r\nviolations of our borders; and generally to prevent outsiders\r\nfrom interfering illegally in Papua New Guinea’s internal\r\naffairs. In so doing, we add the reminder that it is not the\r\nforeign meddlers who will suffer most from the effects of\r\nthe crisis — it will be the people of Papua New Guinea,\r\nincluding the overwhelming majority of Bougainvilleans,\r\nwho consider themselves to be part of our nation and\r\nentitled to the same rights as all other Papua New\r\nGuineans.\r\nConscious of the violations that have occurred on all\r\nsides and of the need to avoid any repetition, my\r\nGovernment is in the process of trying to strengthen\r\nexisting arrangements by establishing a national commission\r\non human rights.\r\nMy Government has embarked on an ambitious\r\nprogramme of structural adjustment, because we — and not\r\nsome outside body — think that we should in order to\r\nensure that development can be sustained for future\r\ngenerations. While we accept external advice and appreciate\r\nexternal assistance, we have not yielded to, and will not\r\ngive in to, external pressure. It is crucial that the official\r\nconduct of such bodies not raise basic questions about\r\nrelations between these institutions and the sovereignty of\r\nthe member States that they are supposed to serve.\r\nNational and collective self-reliance are both means\r\nof achieving and integral to the objective of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. They are critical to maintaining and\r\nstrengthening the security and sovereignty of States.\r\nNational self-reliance is among Papua New Guinea’s\r\nconstitutional goals and directive principles. Collective\r\nself-reliance through South Pacific cooperation is among\r\nthe commitments contained in my Government’s Pacific\r\nPlan and implemented through our current national\r\nbudget.\r\nMy Government’s proposal that Papua New Guinea\r\nshould enter into a form of permanent association with\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is\r\nintended to further the process by which we cooperate\r\nwith neighbouring countries to promote collective\r\nself-reliance. We appreciate the positive interest that\r\nASEAN members have expressed in the idea and we\r\nstrongly support closer cooperation between ASEAN and\r\nthe South Pacific Forum.\r\nAs the only Pacific island country directly involved\r\nin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\r\n(APEC), but by no means the only such country likely to\r\nbe affected by the process, Papua New Guinea has\r\nproposed that APEC set up a scheme to help build\r\ncapacity among the 13 small island developing countries\r\nin the region so that they are not left or pushed behind.\r\nThe proposal that we are now developing in greater\r\ndetail is emphatically not intended to be yet another\r\nopen-ended aid programme under a different name.\r\nRather, it is intended to help small island countries\r\nmanage their way through the transition to the\r\nachievement of APEC’s vision of open-ended regional\r\nfree trade by the year 2020.\r\nAs an active participant in institutions established\r\nunder the Lomé Convention, Papua New Guinea would\r\nlike to encourage other member States to give early\r\nconsideration to the kinds of changes that would facilitate\r\ndevelopment processes and objectives consistent with\r\nWorld Trade Organization rules.\r\nConscious of the aid fatigue now spreading through\r\nmany advanced industrial countries, we urge Governments\r\nand people of goodwill to recognize the time and effort\r\nthat development requires. With a few very honourable\r\nexceptions, donor countries have not reached — and in\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nmany cases have fallen far behind — aid targets to which\r\nthey agreed a generation ago.\r\nThus, not only has aid been reduced, but recipients are\r\neven more locked and tied to donors’ own preferences. The\r\neffect that the failure to honour commitments can have on\r\nnational forward planning can be very severe. It underlines\r\nthe need for a reduced reliance on aid and for the\r\ndevelopment of a greater degree of self-reliance.\r\nIn view of the vital role that the business sector can\r\nplay in mobilizing capital for investment and trade, we\r\nwelcome schemes designed to assist in the development of\r\nthe private sector. We especially welcome the contributions\r\nmade to such schemes by the advanced industrial countries.\r\nWe cannot achieve all our reforms without the support\r\nof world institutions. That is accepted. However, those\r\ninstitutions themselves need to operate with greater\r\nflexibility and to be more sensitive to the particular needs\r\nof Governments to preserve democracy, the environment\r\nand their people’s national identity and culture.\r\nMy Government takes a global view of Papua New\r\nGuinea’s foreign relations and of issues on the United\r\nNations agenda. We encourage official agencies, business\r\nand non-governmental organizations both to “Look North”\r\nand to “Work the Pacific” for mutual benefit with close\r\nneighbours. Conscious that we must not overlook\r\nlongstanding friends, we give high priority to reinforcing\r\ncore relationships. Our overall objective is to continue\r\nreform at home in order to meet the challenges of global\r\nchange.\r\nWe will continue to support wider efforts at reform,\r\nincluding those directed at and through the United Nations,\r\nin order to meet the challenges of global change and\r\nembrace the imperatives of reform in readiness for the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nSir Julius Chan, Prime Minister of Papua New\r\nGuinea, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nNorway.\r\nMs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, Ms. Gro\r\nHarlem Brundtland, and inviting her to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMs. Brundtland (Norway): Tomorrow, I am going\r\nto sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty on\r\nbehalf of Norway. We join with almost all countries in\r\ncelebrating our new freedom — freedom from fear of\r\nnuclear contamination and proliferation. By our joint\r\nresolve, the terror of competitive madness fell victim to\r\nthe sheer force of reason.\r\nThanks to the United Nations, the norm of\r\nnon-testing has been galvanized. It is today part and\r\nparcel of international law. In the future, no country,\r\nwhether it has signed that treaty or not, will be able to\r\nbreak that norm. That can no longer be done with\r\nimpunity. It will go down in the annals of history that\r\nnuclear testing was carried out over a period of 40 years\r\nin the twentieth century, and then never again.\r\nThe decades of negotiations seemed endless, and\r\nwithout the perseverance of this Organization, it would\r\nnot have worked. Where else could we carve out a global\r\ntest ban? Where else can we cast norms of global\r\napplicability? Where else can we extend an international\r\nsociety based on law and contract?\r\nThat is what the United Nations does best. It is easy\r\nto ridicule years of meticulous negotiations. It is easy to\r\nderide the process as bloated bureaucracy and\r\ninefficiency. It is easy because that also happens every\r\nday, here by the East River. And we must never become\r\nused to that.\r\nBut some processes take time because they are\r\ndifficult and because they have profound effects on the\r\nwhole world. Every country, every man, woman and child\r\ndepend on what we can achieve right here, and every\r\ncountry represented here has a stake in our success or our\r\nfailure.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nFor more than 50 years, the United Nations has — for\r\nbetter, but also for worse — reflected its Members, global\r\npolitical trends, contrasts, conflicts and confrontations. It\r\nhas been judged, unjustly, more by its failures than by its\r\nsuccesses.\r\nThe integration of scores of new Member States,\r\npeace-keeping operations, the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights, and field activities in developing countries\r\nbringing relief and consolation to millions of destitute\r\npeople all bear witness to how the United Nations has\r\nharnessed the best of humanity and civilization. Today, the\r\nthreats to peace come not so much from contention between\r\ngreat States. Today’s killing fields are within States. Out of\r\naround 40 cases of armed conflict in the world today,\r\nhardly any occur between States. These conflicts are deeply\r\nembedded in the history of regions and peoples, where\r\ndisruption within societies date far back, some being\r\ncenturies old.\r\nThe price of intra-State conflict is being paid by\r\ncivilians. Ninety per cent of casualties in armed conflict are\r\ncivilians. They literally walk the minefields where millions\r\nof anti-personnel mines are strewn. Not only is the\r\ndeath-toll numbing; let us also count the many missed years\r\nof economic production, the livestock lost, the schools\r\nravaged, the clinics destroyed.\r\nMillions pay the terrible human price. But we all pay\r\na price if the gap deepens between the fundamental norms\r\nof civilization and the daily suffering in too many countries\r\nin too many parts of the world. Reversing that trend is our\r\nmoral obligation; preventing deadly conflict is our common\r\nchallenge.\r\nTrue, the United Nations is increasingly involved in\r\ninternal crises. We still do not possess the necessary means,\r\nmandates and mission capacity to suppress devastating\r\nconflict. All too often, intervention comes when the conflict\r\nhas erupted, when the battles have been fought and the\r\ndividing lines have been cemented. When the peacemakers\r\nare ready to go, it may be late — often too late.\r\nWe lack efficient procedures for dealing with\r\nemerging conflicts. To individual countries, emerging\r\nintra-State conflict may not be deemed vital. But to the\r\nUnited Nations, any armed conflict or threat of conflict\r\nmust be vital. We need more preventive action and more\r\npreventive diplomacy. Here at the United Nations, we need\r\nto develop the institutional, legal and managerial capacity\r\nto act, which would provide a model for regional action.\r\nPreventing conflict and human suffering must not be\r\nhampered by the traditional norm of what is essentially\r\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of States. Killing people\r\ncannot be protected by the Charter.\r\nA situation which is not visibly dangerous and which\r\ndoes not offer spectacular pictures for the evening news,\r\nis all too often silenced and out of the news picture. And\r\nsince those who suffer have no vote in any of the\r\ncountries which command the resources to help, it may be\r\nall too convenient to look the other way.\r\nBut reacting in time need not be costly. On the\r\ncontrary, there is so much to gain, there is so much to\r\nsave. Much could be achieved if the United Nations were\r\nbetter able to send experienced diplomats and support\r\nmissions to conflict-ridden areas in timely endeavours to\r\ndeescalate conflict and reconstruct civil society. We know\r\nthat the hands of the Secretary-General are often tied in\r\nsuch cases, when it comes to redirecting resources. That\r\nis another challenge. United Nations expertise — our\r\nexpertise — may not show up in a situation because there\r\nare insufficient funds to pay for air tickets.\r\nNorway is ready to make an extra contribution. We\r\noffer to establish a fund for preventive action here at the\r\nUnited Nations. We pledge to fill it with approximately 1\r\nmillion dollars on an annual basis, and we invite other\r\nGovernments to join us. The fund would facilitate\r\nimmediate deployment of first-class expertise for\r\nproactive diplomacy.\r\nAny organization that fails to change is bound to\r\nlose its effectiveness. So we must press on with reform.\r\nBut we cannot accept intimidation. Withholding legally\r\nassessed contributions amounts to just that. Today, some\r\ncountries in fact pay more than their fair share. Other\r\ncountries voluntarily pay more than their fair share. Many\r\ncountries pay too little, or hardly anything at all. We now\r\nneed to settle on a long-term solution based on a more\r\nequitable scale of contributions and scrupulous respect by\r\nMember States for their financial obligations and the\r\npayment of arrears.\r\nWe must press on with reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are not served by protracted denials of the\r\nworld as it is. The Security Council must reflect this\r\nworld, and the issue of a regionally-balanced enlargement\r\nmust now be addressed. Asia, Africa and Latin America\r\nshould be represented on a permanent basis. Japan and\r\nGermany should each have a permanent seat. And as we\r\nenlarge the Council we must see to it that the efficiency\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nof decision-making is retained and that the Council’s\r\nimplementing ability is greatly enhanced.\r\nIf we had sat down at the drawing board to create the\r\nUnited Nations today, we would have grouped the most\r\nclosely interlinked challenges together and designated a\r\nlimited number of agencies to deal with them. Today, in the\r\nsocial and economic field, responsibility for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, poverty, population and education is divided.\r\nThere is too much fragmentation and too many turf battles.\r\nWe need a leaner — and thereby, I believe, stronger\r\n— structure to deal with what we decided in Rio,\r\nCairo,Copenhagen and Beijing. Now we must do what we\r\nsaid there.\r\nThe Nordic countries, in their ongoing project for\r\nUnited Nations reform, have focused on the other end of\r\nthe spectrum — the country level. Today, there are several\r\nUnited Nations representatives in one country, often\r\noverlapping each other and often contributing to more\r\nfragmentation. But political issues, humanitarian issues and\r\nlong-term development are interlinked. Our organizational\r\nset-up should be the same. Let us coordinate our\r\nhumanitarian assistance activities better, thus allowing us to\r\nreact more quickly and more effectively. And let us speak\r\nout more openly about human rights.\r\nHuman rights are violated all over the world. But only\r\nin a few countries is the human rights situation\r\ndeteriorating. We may be impatient; we may find that\r\nprogress is too slow in important countries; and there may\r\nbe temporary set-backs.\r\nBut in a world of global communication, facts can no\r\nlonger be hidden. We cannot build fences around ideas in\r\nthe age of the Internet. It will become increasingly\r\nimpossible to derive the benefits of the global economy\r\nwithout exposing political power structures to the scrutiny\r\nof democracy.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nestablished a global norm. This is what the United Nations\r\ndoes best and what it must continue to do. The first Chapter\r\nof the Charter calls for effective collective measures for the\r\nremoval of threats to the peace. Our challenge is to grasp\r\nthe complexity of today’s threats. No single country is\r\npowerful enough to deal alone with the threats that\r\ntranscend our frontiers — terrorism, nuclear proliferation,\r\ndrugs, crime, disease and damage to the environment. They\r\nall require common action. They all belong on our common\r\nagenda.\r\nFive years ago in Rio we reached consensus on\r\nAgenda 21. That was a call for action. Together we\r\nsowed the first seeds of a global norm for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Now we must struggle on towards its\r\nimplementation.\r\nLater this year we will start the final work on a\r\nclimate protocol. No challenge is more global than\r\nclimate change. We owe it to present and future\r\ngenerations to come up with a binding agreement that is\r\ncost-effective, equitable and verifiable. That process will\r\nrequire a combined political and scientific craftsmanship\r\nwhich will need to draw upon every experience we have\r\nhad in multilateral diplomacy so far.\r\nThere can be no civilized world unless we unite to\r\nstrengthen multilateralism by establishing global\r\nnorms, by building and raising the minimum standards of\r\ninter- and intra-State behaviour, and by building new\r\nnorms of international accountability.\r\nThe war crimes tribunal in The Hague is a\r\nbuilding-block in that edifice. The preventive aspect\r\nwould be served if the Karadzićs and Mladićs of this\r\nworld were brought to justice to answer for their crimes.\r\nBut again, conflicts should not be allowed to go that\r\nfar. We must be able to address the root causes of\r\nconflict in time. That is what prevention is all about. That\r\nis the win-win game we should all be playing. We cannot\r\nafford not to do so.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nNorway for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of\r\nEthiopia, Mr. Seyoum Mesfin.\r\nMr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): First of all, I should like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. I wish to\r\nassure you the full cooperation of my delegation in the\r\ndischarge of this heavy responsibility entrusted to you. I\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nshould like also to take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for the able\r\nmanner in which he fulfilled his responsibilities.\r\nLast year we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations and reiterated our dedication to the purposes\r\nand principles of the Organization, for the promotion of\r\nwhich it was established. That occasion also afforded us the\r\nopportunity to take stock of United Nations achievements\r\nand of its yet-unfinished business, as well as of the\r\ncontinuing challenges faced by both the Organization and\r\nthe international community at large.\r\nThat stock-taking exercise could not have led us to\r\nunderestimate, let alone belittle, what has been achieved by\r\nthe United Nations. In any case, in so far as the United\r\nNations is our universal Organization, its failings can only\r\nbe our failings, as its successes are also ours. None the less,\r\nlast year’s stock-taking of the performance of the 50-year-\r\nold United Nations must have underlined more than\r\nanything else how complex and daunting the challenges\r\nfaced by the Organization and by the international\r\ncommunity are becoming. There are probably no greater\r\nchallenges before the international community in this regard\r\nthan those of development and of peace and stability —\r\ntwo concerns that define the very essence of the United\r\nNations and that constitute the core purposes and objectives\r\nof the Organization.\r\nIt is not yet a distant memory that we all rejoiced at\r\nthe end of the cold war, believing that it would open up\r\nnew vistas of opportunity for addressing the vital issues of\r\ninternational concern that had been overshadowed for\r\ndecades by the arms race, East-West rivalry and other\r\nmanifestations of the cold-war era. That positive\r\ndevelopment — the end of the cold war — also encouraged\r\nmany in the developing world, especially those of us in\r\nAfrica, to undertake far-reaching political and economic\r\nreform measures, with a view to laying the foundation for\r\ndemocratic transformation and meaningful economic growth\r\nand development.\r\nDespite all these manifested hopes and courageous\r\nmoves towards economic reform and democracy, the\r\nsituation on the African continent remains a source of great\r\nconcern. At present, Africa is the only continent where the\r\nlevel of poverty is increasing dramatically. Needless to say,\r\nthis trend could lead to unimaginable consequences unless\r\nit is arrested and reversed as speedily as possible.\r\nMr. de Moura (Angola), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThus, Africa’s genuine fear is that the opportunity created\r\nby the end of the cold war will disappear and that a\r\nhistoric chance will be squandered forever.\r\nIt is by no means accidental that, of all the regions\r\nof the world, Africa is the most affected by conflicts and\r\nlack of stability. Conflicts in our continent have not only\r\nbeen greater in number, but have also proved to be more\r\nintractable and, more often than not, more deadly and\r\nmore destructive, in terms of both human lives and\r\nproperty.\r\nIt may not always be plausible to suggest that all\r\nconflicts in Africa have their roots in economic\r\ndifficulties only. But, whatever the constellation of factors\r\nimmediately responsible for specific conflict situations in\r\nAfrica, the fact remains that in most instances civil strife\r\nand conflicts in the continent have emerged within the\r\ncontext of deteriorating economic situations. In this\r\ncontext, the only durable solution for the political crisis\r\nin Africa can be found in the economic regeneration and\r\ndevelopment of the continent. Development is therefore\r\nthe only reliable preventive means to ensure and maintain\r\npeace and stability in Africa.\r\nThe development of Africa will continue to be a\r\ndistant dream unless the known obstacles are removed,\r\namong which the debt burden continues to be the major\r\nimpediment. In this context, we are encouraged by the\r\nrecent Lyon summit of the Group of Seven, which we\r\nwere hopeful would go beyond the Naples terms in easing\r\nthe debt overhang for countries such as Ethiopia. We also\r\nhope that some progress will be made during the\r\nupcoming annual meeting of the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund in connection with\r\nmultilateral debt. For countries like my own, this is very\r\ncrucial indeed.\r\nWhile durable solutions to conflicts and to the lack\r\nof peace and stability in Africa or anywhere else can\r\nhardly be achieved within the context of economic\r\ndislocation and economic decline, it is also equally true\r\nthat development requires peace and stability. This is the\r\nvicious circle we find ourselves in, which makes it\r\ndifficult to find speedy resolution of the very many\r\nconflict situations that have led to unspeakable human\r\nsuffering, and on some occasions to genocide, in Africa.\r\nIn Somalia, where peace and national reconciliation\r\nhave eluded the people for close to six years, we are still\r\nfar from making any headway in reversing the situation.\r\nEfforts are, however, still continuing to help bring about\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nnational reconciliation in Somalia, and my own Prime\r\nMinister has continued to attach the highest importance to\r\nthis endeavour. In all these efforts, the role of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has been vital;\r\nwhether it is in Liberia, Burundi, Somalia or other conflict\r\nsituations in Africa, the important contribution that the\r\nOAU Secretary-General has been making is a source of\r\ngreat satisfaction to us. The Organization of African Unity\r\nhas indeed upgraded its capacity for conflict resolution in\r\nour continent since the establishment in 1993 of the OAU\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution. I wish to seize this opportunity to express\r\nappreciation to all those who have continued to help ensure\r\nthat the OAU’s role in this area is strengthened and\r\nenhanced.\r\nConflict situations, whether in Africa or elsewhere,\r\nhave negative consequences not only for the countries\r\ndirectly affected but also for their neighbours and their\r\nregions. The situation in Somalia has not been an exception\r\nto this. The absence of central authority for an extended\r\nperiod of time in that country has been seen to provide\r\nopportunity for extra-regional elements bent on exporting\r\nterror and on experimenting with plans designed to create\r\ninstability and chaos in our region. It is therefore in my\r\ncountry’s direct national interest that peace be established\r\nand national reconciliation achieved in Somalia as speedily\r\nas possible.\r\nThis is also in the interest of our region in general.\r\nOur region, which has had a prolonged period of instability\r\nand which has also recently experienced State-sponsored\r\nterrorism, cannot afford and should not be expected to\r\ntolerate the proliferation and the establishment of centres of\r\ninternational terrorism by multinational elements in our\r\nmidst. The spread of terrorism is not a danger merely to\r\nour region, but to the international community as a whole.\r\nEthiopia’s conscience is clear in this regard because it has\r\ndone its level best to fulfil its responsibilities in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, and it will always remain committed to\r\ncombating this evil.\r\nAt present, the most worrying conflict, with the\r\npotential for a level of human slaughter which we all dread\r\nto see, is the one in Burundi. The parties to the conflict in\r\nBurundi have the responsibility to save their society from\r\ndecimation through accommodation based on principles that\r\nsuit the specific conditions of their country. Others with a\r\nmuch more complex societal mix have managed to put in\r\nplace democratic mechanisms to reconcile the right of the\r\nmajority to govern with sufficient guarantees for the\r\nsecurity and dignity of the minority. This is what\r\nex-President Mwalimu Nyerere has been striving to assist\r\nthe Burundi parties to achieve through the Mwanza peace\r\nprocess, a process which enjoys the full support of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the international community. I wish\r\nto take this opportunity to express appreciation for the\r\nresolve and unity that the countries of the region have\r\ndemonstrated in an effort to see to it that disaster is\r\naverted in Burundi and that the country achieves national\r\nreconciliation. I wish also to express appreciation to all\r\nthose who have continued to support the Mwanza process\r\nand the initiative that was taken by the countries of the\r\nregion on 31 July 1996.\r\nMy country, which emerged from a very difficult\r\nperiod of conflicts and severe economic hardships only\r\nfive years ago, has made major strides on all fronts\r\nduring this brief period of time. We draw immense\r\nsatisfaction from the fact that our people have finally\r\nachieved durable peace and stability. Moreover, our\r\neconomic reform programmes have started to bear fruit;\r\nwe are encouraged by the results achieved, particularly in\r\nagricultural production, over the past few years. That\r\nEthiopia now has the capacity not only to feed itself, but\r\nalso to be an exporter of food grains, is increasingly\r\nbecoming a reality.\r\nEthiopia is striving to enhance its capacity to\r\nbecome a useful and effective partner in international\r\neconomic cooperation. We intend to make our country an\r\nattractive place for investment; all the necessary\r\nfoundations have already been laid by my Government to\r\nthis end. We are determined to make trade and investment\r\nthe major pillars of our economic cooperation with others.\r\nEthiopia has also endeavoured to contribute its share\r\nto regional and international peace and stability over the\r\npast few years. That is a policy that we intend to expand\r\nfurther with a view to fulfilling our regional and\r\ninternational commitments, no matter how small our\r\ncontribution might be.\r\nEthiopia welcomes the recent adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We believe that it\r\nrepresents an important step towards the attainment of the\r\nlarger objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations,\r\nEthiopia attaches the highest importance to the work of\r\nthe United Nations and wishes to see the Organization\r\nrevitalized and strengthened. In this context, Ethiopia, like\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nmany other countries, is convinced that the future of the\r\nUnited Nations lies in its democratization and in the\r\ncreation of conditions under which all Member States, big\r\nor small, will feel that the Organization belongs equally to\r\nall of them.\r\nWith respect to developments in Africa, in the area of\r\nconflict prevention and in other areas, my Government is\r\nkeen to see more effective cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity. No doubt,\r\nmuch work needs to be done in this area, and we are\r\nconfident that the mechanism for consultation already in\r\nplace between the two organizations will be utilized more\r\neffectively and with a far greater sense of purpose and\r\nconsistency.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express my\r\nGovernment’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\nvery useful and timely initiative on the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. The Special\r\nInitiative is complementary to the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, and,\r\nthrough the reallocation of existing resources and the\r\nmobilization of additional ones, will contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. We hope that the Special Initiative\r\nwill be implemented as planned and that it will not, like\r\nprevious initiatives, remain unfulfilled and be another\r\nsource of frustration and an empty promise.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations can do more to\r\npromote effectively the purposes and principles enshrined\r\nin its Charter and to galvanize international cooperation to\r\nachieve peace and development. Our world cannot afford to\r\nsee the international community divided in two, with one\r\nhalf remaining poor and becoming even poorer. The\r\nimperatives of interdependence dictate that this trend be\r\nreversed, especially when all that those who are lagging\r\nbehind demand is the removal of the obstacles to\r\ndevelopment and an opportunity to address their economic\r\nproblems on the basis of their own efforts.\r\nEthiopia is confident that the United Nations will play\r\nan increasingly dynamic role, so that all the nations and\r\npeoples of the world will have an equal stake in the\r\npreservation of global civilization and in enriching human\r\nsociety.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Francisco Tudela Van Breughel Douglas.\r\nMr. Tudela Van Breughel Douglas (Peru)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): At the outset, allow me,\r\nSir, to convey to you and to this Assembly the greetings\r\nand congratulations of the Peruvian people, as well as\r\ntheir best wishes and hopes for the future.\r\nPeru is a country that has successfully dealt with its\r\ndomestic contradictions, and which is looking with vision\r\nand determination towards the broad new horizons of\r\ninternational activity. A careful review of what has been\r\nachieved to date reveals that much remains to be done;\r\nbut it also shows that we are following the right course in\r\naddressing the demands of our times.\r\nHowever, it would be superficial to use this\r\nAssembly, whose central theme is the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, to recapitulate the events of the past year.\r\nWe must wake up to the outcome of a long historical\r\nprocess that has accelerated markedly over the last quarter\r\nof a century and established around the world a network\r\nof international organizations that today exceed the\r\nnumber of States. We must also wake up to a fortunate\r\nnew development: the individual human being has\r\nacquired a position of cardinal importance in the\r\ninternational system.\r\nThe organizations established by States to satisfy\r\ninternational, human and regional needs, have acquired a\r\npermanent character and have created new systems of\r\ninternational relations. When we speak today of reforming\r\nthe United Nations, no one fails to acknowledge that new\r\nmechanisms are required to promote greater development\r\nand economic and social stability in the world, and to\r\nface current and future conflicts between and within\r\nStates.\r\nThere is discussion of the possibility of creating a\r\nnew economic council and a new social council, as well\r\nas expanding and strengthening the Security Council. At\r\nthe same time, the need has emerged to transform and\r\nrationalize the United Nations system, together with the\r\nimperative of resolving the Organization’s financial crisis.\r\nBut in order to carry out those reforms, we need to have\r\na clear-sighted appreciation of the international scene and\r\nto adapt the Organization to that reality, so that we can\r\nachieve a fruitful and forward-looking perspective. It is\r\nnecessary for States, in the framework of the United\r\nNations system, to overcome their traditional activities\r\nand jointly engage in tasks to deal with those new\r\nrealities so as to achieve broader representation and\r\nfunctionality, with the possibility of future growth.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nWhen the United Nations was founded in 1945, at the\r\nend of the Second World War, international relations were\r\ndifferent from today. The end of the cold war and the\r\nrealities of regional integration have made necessary a new\r\nvision of the relationship between State sovereignty and the\r\nsupra-national realities of the international system. Huge\r\nsocial and economic challenges make it necessary for us to\r\npersevere in pursuing the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter, to strengthen diplomatic action, and not to\r\nsuccumb to arbitrary interpretations of international legality,\r\nwhich undermine the indispensable primacy of international\r\nlaw.\r\nToday the inadequacy of the nation State is more\r\nevident than ever, and the appreciation of supranational\r\nstructures is more widespread than in the past. We discard\r\nthe simplistic visions of pure internationalism, but we\r\nuphold the validity, of the entities that are active today\r\nalongside or above State sovereignty. The vitality of the\r\nAndean Common Market, the Southern Cone Common\r\nMarket (MERCOSUR) and the European Union shows us\r\na future of common and vigorous legal international\r\narrangements. We are facing the definitive crisis of\r\nnationalism, if not of full legal competence of the nation\r\nState. International law today appears as the only\r\nframework of standards with which to face the new\r\nrealities.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the nuclear reality was one\r\nof the factors that transformed the traditional concept of the\r\nnation State. The ability to foresee its results has made the\r\ndecision to accept war more exceptional, and non-atomic\r\narmies have adhered to broader, supranational military\r\norganizations. Atomic weapons have abolished the\r\nimpermeability of the nation State.\r\nWe are likewise faced with a crisis of the very\r\nconcept of borders. Traditionally, empires thought of\r\nthemselves only in terms of being an extension of their\r\nborders. Today borders are not an obstacle to integration.\r\nHowever, this does not imply that we are building a\r\nuniversal State, a global “cosmocracy”. There are natural\r\nlimits to the territorial applicability of laws, and it is true\r\nthat the concentration of power has unbreachable limits,\r\nbeyond which it cannot go. Accordingly, history has so far\r\nnot led us to a universal State, but rather to a freer\r\nstructure, a complex political pluralism with a common\r\ngeneral foundation of representative democracy, individual\r\nliberties and economic freedom. We are facing new,\r\nfunctionally limited supra-statal powers, with different\r\narrangements that differ in scope and intensity and that are\r\nsuperimposed upon the system of State borders.\r\nThe modern theory of the State forged by\r\nMachiavelli and Bodin, the concept of the State as an\r\nabsolute power that excludes any other power, is today\r\nfading. For more than 20 years States have recognized\r\nforces superior to themselves. The idea of the unlimited\r\nsovereign State has broken down; the linchpin of the\r\nwhole theory of the modern State has broken down.\r\nToday sovereignty continues to exist, but not as unlimited\r\npolitical power, but rather as full constitutional legal\r\ncompetence. That seventeenth-century concept that\r\ninspired the Peace of Westphalia, cuius regio eius religio\r\n— that each State should have a religion — has been left\r\nbehind. This is more apparent than ever at the end of the\r\ncold war, when the secular beliefs that confronted the\r\nworld have been discarded. Today the cohesion of human\r\nsocieties is governed by universal concepts.\r\nThe new reality leads us to assert that State\r\nsovereignty has already been made subject to international\r\nlaw — and, it can be said, to natural law — thus negating\r\nthe theoretical legitimacy of the State that was born with\r\nthe modern age. This in no way means that there is no\r\nlonger a need for patriotism, the concept of fatherland or\r\nnational histories. It means, instead, that the myth of the\r\nnationalist State has collapsed.\r\nIn a truly human breakthrough and not a purely\r\ntechnological one, all moral values today are reduced to\r\ntheir personal roots. Today, neither Governments nor the\r\ngoverned can shirk the ethical imperatives that rule\r\nequally over their public and private conduct. This is due\r\nboth to the process just outlined and to a wholly new and\r\nfar-reaching technological revolution in mass\r\ncommunications.\r\nThe law of nations was at first a principle of\r\ncommercial intercourse. It later came to apply to only one\r\nkind of actor: the nation State. Today, an open functional\r\nregionalism is bringing about far-reaching changes that\r\nare swiftly altering the existing order, and the United\r\nNations would be ill-advised to disregard that new reality\r\nin strengthening the Security Council and reforming its\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThis is the cornerstone upon which the United\r\nNations should be re-founded, now that the circumstances\r\nof power which governed its life at the close of the\r\nSecond World War and during the cold war have been\r\novercome. We should not lose sight of the fact that,\r\nalthough the act of consent that forged this new, open,\r\nfunctional regionalism was the work of the nation State,\r\ntoday that regionalism is already a supranational reality\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nthat has taken on a life of its own and is spreading around\r\nthe world. Inter-statal balances of power are giving way to\r\nregional balances of power that are not concentrated in a\r\nsingle focal point of power and that are more decentralized\r\nand more rational.\r\nThe future will be one in which an international\r\nsystem with freer and more flexible structures will be based\r\non the freedom of man as an individual, as a person. This\r\nobliges States, within the framework of the United Nations\r\nsystem, to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly\r\nengage in management activities in the Organization based\r\non the new cultural, economic and geographical reality\r\nmade up of broad functional regional areas. I say once\r\nagain: this is the keystone of the foundation of the new\r\nedifice of the United Nations.\r\nI have come here to reiterate the commitment of Peru\r\nand of the Peruvian people to the United Nations, but also\r\nto warn that the new realities that must not be ignored.\r\nThose realities have guided the policy of President Alberto\r\nFujimori and are the inspiration for his Government’s\r\nfar-reaching and successful reform. Peru, in its continental\r\nrelations, today bases its foreign policy upon the principles\r\nof open functional regionalism and strives to link the\r\nPacific with the Atlantic through supranational\r\narrangements.\r\nRooted in its rich Latin-American heritage, my country\r\nsees its future in continental terms, drawing upon Latin\r\nAmerica’s important contribution in the area of integration,\r\ninternational law and mechanisms for peace and security.\r\nAccordingly, we are convinced that organizational changes\r\nin the United Nations should be based on those same\r\nprinciples.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address by the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nMr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco, Mr. Abdellatif Filali, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Filali (Morocco) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAt the outset I would like, on behalf of my country, to\r\ncongratulate the President sincerely, and the friendly\r\ncountry of Malaysia, on his election to preside over the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. His\r\ncompetence and profound knowledge of international\r\naffairs will clearly contribute to the achievement of the\r\nexpected results of the session. I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to assure him that the delegation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco will provide its full support and\r\nassistance in order to achieve those results.\r\nI would also like to express my deep appreciation to\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the wisdom with which\r\nhe guided the proceedings of the fiftieth session and for\r\nhis commendable efforts in connection with the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAlthough the cold war ended a few years ago, and\r\ndespite the hopes of the peoples of the world that a new\r\ninternational era would dawn in which they could reap the\r\nbenefits and dividends of peace and take part on an equal\r\nfooting in the guidance and management of international\r\naffairs in order to preserve their ideals, values and\r\ninterests, we note that the current world situation is\r\ncharacterized by instability and confusion and is far from\r\nreflecting the order we so hoped to achieve. Indeed, far\r\nfrom bringing peace, security and justice, the end of the\r\ncold war spawned a situation in which local crises have\r\nbrought suffering to millions of people in several regions\r\nof the world, severely stirring our global conscience.\r\nThese crises have also highlighted the inability of the\r\ninternational community to devise effective mechanisms\r\nto resolve such conflicts in an equitable way and to put\r\nan end to the tragedies they engender.\r\nMorocco believes that the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative for restructuring the United Nations and\r\nstrengthening its role falls precisely within this\r\nperspective and can prepare the Organization to deal with\r\nthe effects of these conflicts through preventive\r\ndiplomacy, the development and reform of United Nations\r\nbodies, and coordination between the United Nations and\r\nother international and regional organizations. We are,\r\nmoreover, convinced that the re-election of Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali to a second term as Secretary-General\r\nwould be the best guarantee for the continuation of those\r\nreforms. The Secretary-General’s experience, competence,\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\ncourage and spirit of initiative in settling international\r\nconflicts and reactivating international cooperation in\r\nvarious fields, make him the best choice to guide the affairs\r\nof the Organization during a second mandate. Morocco also\r\nhopes that any controversy on the subject will be avoided\r\nin order to forestall adverse repercussions on the work of\r\nthis session and on the future of the Organization.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization provided an opportunity for the numerous\r\nHeads of State who attended the celebration to express\r\nconcerns and apprehensions regarding the challenges\r\nconfronting us. They issued a Declaration that contained\r\ntheir proposals and recommendations for meeting those\r\nchallenges and devising effective mechanisms to promote\r\ncloser relations among countries. In our view, this session\r\nprovides us an opportunity to reflect on those\r\nrecommendations and proposals and to find answers to the\r\nquestions raised by the Heads of State regarding the\r\nfundamental and structural reforms of the United Nations.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council and its\r\nprerogatives in discharging its mandate to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, we believe that any\r\ninitiative aimed at expanding the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and improving its modes of action would\r\nrequire much thought and circumspection. It must take into\r\naccount current realities if any final decision in this regard\r\nis to lead to the desired reform and thereby guarantee\r\nequitable representation of all continents. The aim here is\r\nto ensure the Council’s efficiency and credibility and to\r\nenhance its ability to cope with any violation of\r\ninternational law without impinging on the prerogatives and\r\nrole of the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, any reform that does not take into account\r\nthe current financial difficulties of the Organization clearly\r\ncannot produce the expected results. It will be extremely\r\ndifficult for the United Nations to fulfil its mission without\r\na stable financial base. Hence the need for all Member\r\nStates to pay their contributions, settle their arrears and\r\nthereby give concrete substance to their collective and\r\ncontinued support for the efforts of the Organization.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, many important steps\r\nhave been taken in the control of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons. Following the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-free zones in Latin America and\r\nthe South Pacific and the indefinite extension of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the African\r\ncountries signed a Treaty making Africa a nuclear-free\r\ncontinent. In addition to these achievements, we hope to see\r\nthe Middle East also become a zone free of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and of nuclear weapons in particular.\r\nMoreover, following the success of the efforts to\r\nproduce the final version, the Comprehensive Nuclear\r\nTest-Ban Treaty will be open for signature tomorrow.\r\nMorocco, which made an important contribution to the\r\ndrafting of the Treaty, is convinced that this document\r\nwill open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons, strengthen international cooperation and\r\npromote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy, so that developing countries can\r\nachieve their economic and technical goals.\r\nMorocco’s interest in this subject is predicated on its\r\nacute awareness of the risks involved and that arms\r\ncontrol is the cornerstone of any initiative aimed at firmly\r\nestablishing the basis for international peace and security\r\nthroughout the world. Humanity can be sheltered from the\r\ntragedy of massively destructive wars only through the\r\nfull and complete elimination of nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological weapons under effective international control.\r\nLast year, I told this Assembly that the efforts of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco to achieve territorial integrity had\r\ngone through a series of phases unique in the history of\r\nthe independence of nations. The time has come for\r\nMorocco to recover all its territories.\r\nBeing fully committed to peace and to the settlement\r\nof problems through dialogue, and having continually\r\ndefended this principle in international forums as a means\r\nfor resolving problems between nations, Morocco is\r\nconvinced that the return of the cities of Ceuta and\r\nMelilla and of the neighbouring islands still under\r\nSpanish occupation can only occur through those same\r\nmeans. This is particularly true given the common\r\ninterests and the well-established and good-neighbourly\r\nrelations existing between Morocco and Spain. This is,\r\nmoreover, precisely what His Majesty King Hassan II\r\ntook the initiative to underscore when he called for the\r\nestablishment of a Moroccan-Spanish think tank\r\ndefinitively to resolve this question.\r\nAccordingly, the final, complete solution we are\r\nadvocating is one which preserves Moroccan sovereignty\r\non the territories it holds, while guaranteeing Spanish\r\ninterests. This would further consolidate the dynamics of\r\nthe diverse and close cooperation between the northern\r\nand southern shores of the Mediterranean. We are also\r\nconvinced that our age-old relations with neighbouring\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nSpain will be instrumental in finding a permanent solution\r\nto this question.\r\nThe developments in the Middle East over the past\r\nfew years opened prospects of tolerance and coexistence for\r\nthe peoples of the region, instead of dissension and fighting.\r\nWe view the progress that has been made as an auspicious\r\nsign in that regard, starting with the Madrid Conference and\r\nthe Oslo agreements and progressing to the\r\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement and the Jordanian-Israeli\r\nagreement.\r\nMorocco has contributed to giving life to the concept\r\nof peace in the region, and has made tireless efforts to\r\nestablish a comprehensive, just and lasting peace that would\r\nguarantee the return of all occupied Arab territories,\r\nincluding Al-Quds al-Sharif, the occupied Syrian Golan\r\nHeights and southern Lebanon in keeping with Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978)\r\nand the principle of land for peace. We therefore regret the\r\ninterruption of the peace process, which threatens to destroy\r\nall the efforts we have made to establish security and\r\nstability in the region.\r\nWe have the right to wonder whether the principles\r\nand commitments agreed upon at the Madrid Conference,\r\nwhich provided the groundwork for the process towards\r\nestablishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region,\r\nhave become outdated, not to say null and void. Has the\r\nnew Israeli Government, which seeks to cast doubt on those\r\nprinciples and commitments, realized the disastrous\r\nconsequences of such a course of action, which could take\r\nthe region and its peoples back to a situation we thought\r\nwas behind us thanks to an irreversible commitment and a\r\nnew perception of the region’s future?\r\nWe believe in peace and are dedicated to its defence\r\nand maintenance as an irreversible option and goal. My\r\ncountry has contributed to this mission of its own free will\r\nand in good faith. Similarly, we have on many occasions\r\npointed out that genuine security for all the countries of the\r\nregion can be achieved only through the establishment of a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace which guarantees the\r\nrights of all parties in the region.\r\nIn this respect, we call for scrupulous and unequivocal\r\ncommitment, with no delays, to all that has been agreed\r\nupon, in order to implement the agreements reached\r\naccording to the scheduled phases of the peace process. We\r\nalso call for removing the obstacles impeding the bilateral\r\nArab-Israeli negotiations so that we may keep abreast of the\r\nsubstantial progress made in the multilateral peace process\r\nin order to achieve the desired final solution.\r\nThe blockade imposed on the Palestinian territories,\r\nwhich hinders even the delivery of international assistance\r\nto the Palestinian people, makes it particularly difficult\r\nfor the Palestinian Authority to discharge its obligations\r\nto its people, who are living in extremely difficult\r\nconditions. In addition, the colonization policy applied by\r\nIsrael and the changes it is introducing in the old part of\r\nthe city of Al-Quds and neighbouring areas constitute a\r\nviolation of the United Nations resolutions, principles and\r\ncommitments to which I referred earlier.\r\nIn this respect, we call for a lifting of this blockade\r\nand for providing full material support and assistance to\r\nthe Palestinian Authority, in accordance with the decisions\r\ntaken by the international community, so that the\r\nAuthority can discharge its mission in the best possible\r\nconditions and launch the process of the economic\r\ndevelopment of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in\r\norder to enable the Palestinian people to establish their\r\nindependent State, with Al-Quds as its capital, and to\r\ncontribute, on equal footing, to the progress, cooperation\r\nand prosperity of the region.\r\nThe Gulf crisis has long cast a dark shadow on the\r\nregion and created crisis conditions. We have repeatedly\r\ncalled for transcending these conditions through the\r\nimplementation of internationally binding resolutions\r\nwithin the framework of ensuring the security and\r\nstability of the region and preserving the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the countries of the region. We are\r\nconvinced that this situation cannot continue indefinitely.\r\nThe prospects for an easing of the crisis are\r\nbeginning to emerge, based on the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions, and the\r\nunderstanding reached by Iraq and the United Nations on\r\nthe implementation of resolution 986 (1995), known as\r\nthe oil-for-food resolution. We regret the latest\r\ndevelopments in the Gulf region, which are likely to once\r\nagain plunge that area into a spiral of instability and\r\npostpone the implementation of that resolution. As we call\r\nfor restraint and calm in order to avoid any escalation, we\r\nreaffirm the need to respect Iraq’s sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity and to implement Security Council\r\nresolution 986 (1995), in order to alleviate the hardships\r\nof the Iraqi people, who are still suffering from the\r\nembargo which has been imposed on them for the last six\r\nyears.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nThe problem of the United Arab Emirate islands of the\r\nGreater and the Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa has not yet\r\nbeen resolved. Given the relationship of kinship and\r\nbrotherhood between us and the United Arab Emirates, and\r\ngiven our historic and brotherly relations with Iran, we call\r\nupon the two neighbouring countries to find a definitive\r\nsolution to this crisis on the basis of respect for the\r\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over its islands\r\nand respect for its territorial integrity, in keeping with the\r\nrelations of neighbourliness and the traditional ties existing\r\nbetween the two countries. These ties should be exploited\r\nto the benefit of the peoples of the Emirates and Iran and\r\nto achieve stability in the region.\r\nMorocco attaches special importance to the conflict\r\nbetween Libya and certain Western countries because of its\r\nrepercussions on international and regional relations. In this\r\nconnection, we regretfully note the implications of the\r\nmeasures imposed on Libya and their extensive damaging\r\neffects on the Libyan people and on the economies of\r\nneighbouring countries. The continuation of this situation\r\nhas been a source of concern.\r\nMorocco, which is interested in seeing this problem\r\nsettled amicably, calls for a favourable response to the\r\ninitiatives and efforts made by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nthe Arab League, the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference to find a solution to\r\nthis crisis.\r\nThe world has followed with very keen interest the\r\ninternational efforts aimed at restoring peace in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. These efforts have rekindled hope and\r\nprovided an opportunity to put an end to the conflict in the\r\nregion and to the crimes against humanity that have claimed\r\ntens of thousands of Bosnian lives. Morocco fully supports\r\nthe Bosnian people and their just cause, including the\r\npreservation of their sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nidentity, and has never hesitated, in its current capacity as\r\nChairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to\r\nshoulder its responsibilities to help the Bosnian people\r\novercome their ordeal. Thus, we worked to set up a\r\ncoordination mechanism between the Islamic Contact Group\r\nand the International Contact Group, which contributed to\r\nbringing about the official signing, at the Paris Conference,\r\nof the Dayton Agreement, which aims at putting an end to\r\nthe bloodshed in the region, finding a comprehensive, just\r\nand lasting solution, instilling respect for international\r\nlegality, and contributing to stability in the region. My\r\ncountry has also met its international obligations through its\r\nparticipation in the Implementation Force, thereby\r\ncontributing to the establishment of security and stability\r\nin that region.\r\nWe are gratified to note the substantial progress\r\nmade in the implementation of the military aspects of the\r\nDayton Agreement and the launching of the construction\r\nof political institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\r\nhope that the legislative elections held recently will\r\nconstitute yet another constructive step towards preserving\r\nthe territorial integrity and political unity of the Republic\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and achieving harmony and\r\nconcord among the country’s various constituents in order\r\nto secure its stability and development.\r\nThe current world economic situation clearly reveals\r\nthe wide gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries, as well as the increasing marginalization of the\r\nlatter in the international economic arena. This unbalanced\r\nsituation threatens to lead to conflicts among countries\r\narising out of economic and development considerations\r\nand could thus adversely affect world stability.\r\nGiven the staggering increase in external debt and its\r\nnegative repercussions on the economies of the\r\ndeveloping countries, there is an urgent need today to find\r\nadequate solutions to this situation, which is mortgaging\r\nthe future of the developing countries. Such solutions can\r\nbe achieved only through the creation of conditions more\r\nconducive to increasing equal opportunities among the\r\ncountries of the world and a genuine partnership that can\r\npave the way towards the achievement of balanced and\r\nlasting development.\r\nIn this context, we once again welcome the initiative\r\nof the United Nations Secretary-General in the “Agenda\r\nfor Development”. We hope that it will lead to positive\r\nresults, redress the imbalance and help to achieve the\r\neconomic development sought by the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe changes affecting the international economic\r\nscene following the crystallization of the concept of\r\neconomic globalization and the liberalization of trade-\r\nmandate corrective measures require that the existing\r\ndisproportion be corrected, particularly since the\r\nbehaviour of certain developed countries in trade\r\nliberalization is still marked by a selective approach.\r\nMoreover, protectionist measures and the institution of\r\ncovert barriers in the guise of various environmental and\r\nother considerations are inconsistent with the desirable\r\npolicy of liberalization of international trade.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nWe hope that the task of redressing these imbalances\r\nwill feature prominently among the concerns of the World\r\nTrade Organization in the near future and that a balance\r\nmay be struck between freedom of trade and development\r\nrequirements.\r\nIf a solution is to be found, the role of international\r\nfinancial institutions must be extensively reassessed in view\r\nof the deep changes affecting the international scene.\r\nAccordingly, we call for the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of World Trade Organization agreements and for\r\ncareful thought to be given to defining the concepts of\r\nglobalization that now determine the very future of nations,\r\npeoples and, indeed, entire continents. This could be done\r\nby means of financial and economic transactions designed\r\nto close the gap between countries and to overcome the\r\nmarginalization from which many of them suffer,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nWe keenly hope that the meeting of the World Trade\r\nOrganization at Singapore in December will provide an\r\nopportunity to assess the situation and to enter into a more\r\ncareful consideration of the consistency of economic,\r\nfinancial and monetary policies, for which Morocco has\r\nbeen calling for some time.\r\nThe deterioration in the situation on the African\r\ncontinent is most certainly at the forefront of issues\r\ndemanding a joint effort on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. Effective and practical solutions must be found\r\nfor the serious economic, social and humanitarian problems\r\nfacing African States, which have been compounded by\r\ntragedies such as civil war, the spread of epidemics and\r\ndeadly diseases, desertification, refugee problems and all\r\nthey entail.\r\nMorocco, as a country on the African continent that\r\nenjoys deep-rooted historical and other ties with other\r\nAfrican States, takes a keen interest in the continent’s\r\nproblems. Bearing in mind those ancient ties and our\r\nspecial political relations, my country has contributed,\r\nwithin the means available to it, to the development of\r\nAfrica through the establishment of bilateral cultural and\r\ntechnical cooperation with the States of the continent.\r\nMorocco will therefore spare no effort to develop and\r\nconsolidate bilateral cooperation with African States to help\r\nthe African continent overcome its problems and emerge\r\nfrom marginalization.\r\nDuring the Marrakesh Ministerial Meeting of the\r\nUruguay Round in 1994, His Majesty King Hassan II was\r\nthe first to call for the introduction of a “Marshall Plan”\r\nfor Africa and to stress the need for greater international\r\nefforts to help African States develop their economies and\r\nbecome integrated into the world economy.\r\nIn this framework, we welcome the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. In our opinion,\r\nwe should do our utmost to help this Initiative succeed by\r\nensuring that both the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community provide the necessary financial\r\nand technical support.\r\nWith regard to what is known as the question of\r\nWestern Sahara, I would like to affirm, as I have done\r\nmany times before, Morocco’s commitment and\r\nunswerving willingness to implement the United Nations\r\nSettlement Plan which guarantees the right of all people\r\nfrom the Sahara to express their will through a\r\nreferendum.\r\nIt has now become clear to everyone that since the\r\nend of last year, the United Nations Plan has reached a\r\ndeadlock. We hope that this stalemate will end as soon as\r\npossible so that the Settlement Plan can be carried out on\r\nthe basis of a referendum.\r\nAs the twenty-first century comes into view, the\r\nworld hopes that tomorrow will bring a brighter future\r\ncharacterized by peace, cooperation and brotherhood\r\namong peoples. As we stand on the threshold of a new\r\ncentury, we need to strengthen the United Nations and\r\nconsolidate its capabilities so that it can keep up with the\r\nchanges taking place and respond to people’s desire for\r\nsecurity, justice and development.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNicaragua, His Excellency Mr. Ernesto Leal.\r\nMr. Leal (Nicaragua) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nAllow me to begin by congratulating the President on his\r\nelection to preside over the Assembly this session. We are\r\nconvinced that he will guide our work successfully. We\r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for his work.\r\nIn 1990, when Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro\r\nbecame President of Nicaragua, the country was in a state\r\nof war. Negotiating the demobilization of more than\r\n20,000 people who had taken up arms and reducing an\r\narmy of over 90,000 soldiers were key tasks in ending a\r\ncivil war that had lasted almost 10 years. This\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\ncomplicated pacification process was just the beginning of\r\na process of peace, reconciliation, democracy and\r\ndevelopment in Nicaragua aimed at bringing the country\r\ninto line with the new situation in the region and the\r\nglobalization of international relations.\r\nAs part of this process, we began to modernize the\r\nState, curbed hyper-inflation, liberalized the pricing system\r\nand did away with the State monopoly in the areas of\r\nforeign trade and finance, where we have managed to\r\nprivatize almost all the companies that used to belong to the\r\nState.\r\nAs the State apparatus was reduced, we began to\r\ndecentralize government and transfer responsibilities to\r\nmunicipal and community levels and to sectors in which the\r\nprivate sector could clearly be much more effective.\r\nWe have carried out the process of peace and\r\nreconciliation that was essential for democratic national\r\nconsolidation. We have stabilized the economy and reduced\r\nthe external debt, although, unfortunately, it is still a great\r\nburden.\r\nOne of the main concerns of the Government of\r\nPresident Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has been to ensure\r\nthat the human rights of the entire population of Nicaragua\r\nare respected. To this end, we have adopted legislative and\r\nadministrative provisions that have rid Nicaraguan jails of\r\nmurder, torture and impunity.\r\nWe have set up new institutions that encourage\r\neducation, trade and banking. We have introduced a new,\r\nmuch more effective, social security system. We have\r\nallocated more of our budget to primary and technical\r\neducation, and we can be proud of the unlimited freedom\r\nof the press in Nicaragua today. We have also managed to\r\nestablish civilian control over the military, which will be\r\nanother important bequest to the new Government.\r\nToday our country enjoys the greatest degree of\r\npolitical freedom in its history. Considerable progress has\r\nbeen made in institutionalizing democracy, and the\r\nresources that in the past we Nicaraguans used for war are\r\nnow once again being used for education, health and the\r\nbuilding of housing and roads — in other words, for the\r\ncomprehensive development of Nicaragua.\r\nDemocracy in Nicaragua was born in 1990, with the\r\nelection of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in the\r\nonly truly free election ever enjoyed by the Nicaraguan\r\npopulation in its history. At that difficult time, we\r\nNicaraguans accepted the challenge of sowing the seeds\r\nof a new culture of peace. The United Nations played a\r\nvery important role in this process of achieving\r\ndemocracy and opening up a new era for Nicaragua. In\r\nthe same spirit, the United Nations is now cooperating\r\nwith us and providing guidance for the elections later this\r\nyear.\r\nSince 1990 major changes have occurred at the\r\nworld level. Many countries have rid themselves of\r\noppression and dictatorship. The Iron Curtain has been\r\ntorn down, as have the walls of ideological intolerance.\r\nThe foundations of apartheid have crumbled, and in the\r\nMiddle East a peace process is unfolding, filling us with\r\nhope, although it is not without problems. Major\r\nsacrifices have been made by peoples under totalitarian\r\nregimes so as to win the right to live in peace and\r\nfreedom in a more secure world — a fairer, more\r\npeaceful, tolerant and democratic one.\r\nHowever, we see that new crises and armed conflicts\r\nhave arisen in other regions of the world. Because of its\r\ninternational character, the United Nations is duty-bound\r\nto face up to the challenges of security required by the\r\ncurrent situation; our Organization’s global agenda allows\r\nit to operate more dynamically. The United Nations must\r\nconfront issues such as the eradication of poverty,\r\nenvironmental degradation, terrorism, the use and\r\ntrafficking of drugs, violence suffered by women and the\r\npromotion of democratic values and progress in social\r\ndevelopment. Nicaragua is convinced that peace and\r\ndemocracy are closely related to development, and that\r\nwithout economic development it is extremely difficult to\r\nachieve sustainable democracy.\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s “An Agenda for Peace”\r\nwe have a summary of the important changes that have\r\noccurred in recent years. He sets forth the difficult\r\nconditions of hunger and poverty among other things, still\r\nexisting in developing countries. He also recognizes that\r\nthe burden of debt and barriers to international trade are\r\nstill a danger to world stability. All this makes the\r\ndevelopment of the new concept of international security\r\nmore difficult — as discussed right here in the United\r\nNations. The Secretary-General’s “An Agenda for Peace”\r\nis a mechanism to help us bring about true,\r\ncomprehensive peace.\r\nLet us recall, as was stated today by the Prime\r\nMinister of Norway, that peace is no longer only\r\nsomething that States must seek from one another. We\r\nmust seek peace within each State as well.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nThe sensitive mission of the United Nations at this\r\nnew stage of its development can be illustrated by its\r\ndynamic role in Central America, a region that in 1992 was\r\ndeclared by this very General Assembly to be an area of\r\npeace, freedom, democracy and development.\r\nNo one doubts that the United Nations has begun a\r\nmajor process of profound transformation and renewal,\r\ntaking place precisely 50 years after its establishment and\r\nreflecting the current international situation. With this\r\nrenewal we hope for greater democratization of our world\r\nOrganization, particularly in the Security Council. We also\r\nhope for the admission of new Members to the\r\nOrganization, such as the Republic of China on Taiwan,\r\nwhich meets the requirements set forth in the Charter to be\r\na Member State, but whose right to be a Member is still\r\ndenied it. Likewise, we are expecting the United Nations to\r\ncontribute to developing countries, particularly through\r\nprogrammes of technical cooperation and cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDuring these last few years of transition, while we\r\nhave been establishing and consolidating peace and\r\ndemocracy in Nicaragua, world disarmament has\r\naccelerated. Budgets for armaments have been reduced in\r\nmany countries, and we, the Governments of Central\r\nAmerica, have adopted some serious initiatives as regards\r\nthe production, use and transfer of anti-personnel mines.\r\nWe have also declared Central America to be a region\r\ncompletely free of those devices.\r\nAreas that were once battlegrounds, including\r\nNicaragua, are now seeing demining operations with good\r\nprospects. At the same time, several nuclear-weapon States\r\nhave initiated moratoriums on testing, thus greatly\r\ndiminishing the possibility of a devastating nuclear war.\r\nWe have also seen an increase in the number of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones. The signing of the Pelindaba\r\nTreaty establishes a zone of this kind in Africa; and with\r\nthe establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in\r\nSouth-East Asia we will be strengthening the potential for\r\na more secure world. It is important to recall that very\r\nrecently we adopted by an overwhelming majority, right\r\nhere at United Nations Headquarters, the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe are seriously concerned that much of the recent\r\npolitical progress achieved throughout the world is not\r\nnecessarily in tune with progress in the economic sphere.\r\nDeveloping countries continue to face serious problems\r\nsuch as extreme poverty and unemployment. Access to new\r\ninternational markets continues to be limited for our\r\nproducts. The burden of debt is unbearable, and the\r\nconstant inequalities in international financial systems\r\ncontinue to affect our countries adversely. Therefore, we\r\nmust urgently establish much fairer and more equitable\r\ninternational economic relations.\r\nWe are also concerned that during this same period\r\nof global, regional and national transition, new forms of\r\nintolerance, lack of understanding and violation of human\r\nrights have breached the peace in certain areas of the\r\nworld. Such is the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nSomalia and Rwanda, where events have profoundly\r\ndisturbed the human conscience.\r\nIn this same regard, Nicaragua is troubled by recent\r\nevents in Burundi, where in spite of the efforts of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the\r\ninternational community, the situation remains delicate.\r\nOn the other hand, the efforts made towards reaching\r\npeace in Chechnya hearten us.\r\nWe are concerned at the continuation of practices\r\nand their pernicious effects. We believe that their\r\nperpetrators should be brought to justice without\r\nexception. We condemn attacks such as that upon\r\nPresident Mubarak of Egypt and the recent one in\r\nDharan, Saudi Arabia, in which hundreds of innocent\r\npeople were wounded. We feel great solidarity with the\r\nvictims and their families.\r\nNicaragua is concerned at the growth in the\r\nproduction, consumption and traffic in drugs, and in the\r\ngrowing relationship between terrorism and weapons\r\ntrafficking, which, like drug trafficking, continues to pose\r\na major threat to future generations.\r\nFor these reasons, I would like to state that\r\nNicaragua was pleased to hear the proposal made by the\r\nPresident of Colombia regarding the need to develop a\r\nglobal agenda for drugs. We believe that the United\r\nNations should think hard about that important initiative.\r\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, the\r\ninternational community as a whole should seek out ways\r\nand means to overcome all of these situations. We should\r\nmake our best efforts in that regard. Nicaragua is ready to\r\nsupport the international community in these initiatives.\r\nIn July 1994, the second International Conference of\r\nNew and Restored Democracies was held in Managua,\r\nNicaragua; its main objective was to study in a frank and\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\nobjective manner the weaknesses, prospects and challenges\r\nof new democracies. On this occasion, on behalf of my\r\ncountry and in our capacity of interim secretariat of the\r\nConference, I would like to urge that the third conference\r\nof new democracies, which will be held next year in\r\nBucharest, Romania, receive the international community’s\r\nspecial attention.\r\nIn this ongoing quest for peace and for the\r\nstrengthening of democracy, we in Central America are\r\nputting into practice a new model of regional security. The\r\noutstanding features of this new model have been embodied\r\nin the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central\r\nAmerica, which is a national and regional strategy to foster\r\na change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the\r\nestablishment of a model of sustainable development in the\r\npolitical, economic, social, cultural and environmental\r\nfields.\r\nWe Central Americans have already ratified a\r\nframework treaty for democratic security which deals with\r\nrespect for and the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights. Its provisions ensure the security of the Central\r\nAmerican States and their inhabitants through the\r\nestablishment of conditions which will allow them their\r\npersonal, family and social development in peace, freedom\r\nand democracy. These are initiatives which could be studied\r\nin other regions with the aim of strengthening national\r\nprocesses within the context of new circumstances and with\r\nthe objective of moving towards a new international order\r\nwhich will be more secure, to which we all aspire.\r\nOnly months away from the end of President Violeta\r\nBarrios de Chamorro’s term of office and less than one\r\nmonth from the elections in which her successor will be\r\nchosen, we are very satisfied with the work carried out\r\nduring this period. World and regional events have had, and\r\nwill continue to have, their impact within countries. In the\r\ncase of Nicaragua, this impact has been highly positive. By\r\nthe end of its term, our Government will have left\r\nNicaragua completely different from the Nicaragua we\r\nfound in 1990.\r\nWe are certain that whoever is elected President in the\r\ncoming elections will have the necessary vision to establish,\r\nas it has done in the past, a Government of benefit to all\r\nNicaraguans. Thus, we believe that extensive democratic\r\nconsolidation should also continue in order to continue on\r\nthe path of peace, harmony and progress.\r\nOn behalf of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,\r\nI would like to ask the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations to continue supporting Nicaragua, for the\r\ngood of democracy, for the good of our country, and,\r\nabove all, for the good of the international community.\r\nI take this opportunity on behalf of the people and\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua and on my own behalf to thank\r\nthe States, the Governments, the international\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations which,\r\nin one way or another, have lent our country their\r\ncooperation and solidarity. Without this solidarity we\r\nNicaraguans would never have been able to achieve the\r\ndemocracy we have today, nor would we have been able\r\nto lay the foundation for economic development. To all of\r\nthem and to all of you, members of the Assembly, thank\r\nyou very much.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate for this\r\nmeeting. I shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Gomersall (United Kingdom): On behalf of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, I would like to say a few words today\r\nin response to the remarks made by the Foreign Minister\r\nof Argentina concerning the Falkland Islands. We were\r\nglad that the Foreign Minister again referred to the\r\nincreasing cooperation between the United Kingdom and\r\nArgentina, which characterizes our bilateral relationship.\r\nMy Government sincerely hopes that the progress which\r\nhas been achieved will be built on and further developed.\r\nBut my Government does not accept the Foreign\r\nMinister’s remarks about sovereignty. We have no doubt\r\nabout Britain’s sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and\r\nthe other British territories in the South Atlantic.\r\nIn the Falkland Islands we must heed the wishes of\r\nthe people. Many families trace their ancestry in the\r\nFalklands back for five or six generations. The elected\r\nrepresentatives of the islanders, some of whom visited the\r\nUnited Nations for the debate in the Committee of 24 last\r\nJuly, have expressed their views clearly and on many\r\noccasions. They have stated their belief in their right to\r\nself-determination to live under a Government of their\r\nchoice and, as a democratic voice of the Falkland Islands\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 23 September 1996\r\npeople, they have reiterated their view that they do not\r\nwant to be part of Argentina.\r\nDespite our differences with Argentina on the subject\r\nof sovereignty, we are continuing a constructive dialogue\r\nwith the Government of Argentina on, for example,\r\nhydrocarbons development and fisheries in the South\r\nAtlantic. A further round of talks at the official and\r\nministerial level aimed at making further progress on these\r\nand other issues will take place in New York this week. We\r\nvalue these practical steps to develop United Kingdom-\r\nArgentine cooperation benefitting the islands. We hold\r\nthese discussions while maintaining our position regarding\r\nthe issue of sovereignty over the Falklands.\r\nMrs. Gazeau-Secret (interpretation from French):\r\nThe French delegation must object to the statements made\r\nby the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea regarding the\r\nterritories of French Polynesia and Walis and Futuna. The\r\npopulations of these territories continue to indicate in the\r\nmost democratic possible way that they are part of the\r\nFrench Republic. Therefore, from the point of view of my\r\ndelegation, the questions raised by the Prime Minister of\r\nPapua New Guinea are pointless.\r\nMr. Westendorp (Spain) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Spanish delegation must intervene in the\r\nexercise the right of reply, and wishes to refer to the\r\nreferences to the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and\r\nto other parts of Spanish territory, made this afternoon by\r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\nthe Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nSuch statements do not reflect reality, as they refer\r\nto Spanish territories whose citizens are represented in the\r\nSpanish Parliament with the same rights and under the\r\nsame conditions as the rest of their compatriots. Parallels\r\ncannot be made with other situations of a fundamentally\r\ndifferent nature. Such references are out of step with the\r\nclose overall relationship that today exists between the\r\nKingdoms of Spain and Morocco, both bilaterally and in\r\nthe region to which we, as neighbours, belong.\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Having listened to the statement made by the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Argentina would like to reaffirm the\r\nstatement made this morning by the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Mr. Guido Di Tella.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.50 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
