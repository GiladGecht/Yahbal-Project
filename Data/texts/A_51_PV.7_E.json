(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.00 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski, President of\r\nthe Republic of Poland.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Aleksander Kwasniewski, President of the\r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Poland, His Excellency Mr.\r\nAleksander Kwasniewski, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Kwasniewski: I am pleased to speak before\r\nthe Assembly of this universal Organization, where virtually\r\nevery country in the world, small or vast, rich or poor, has\r\na voice, thus making democracy work in international\r\nrelations.\r\nAt the outset, I should like warmly to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to your honourable office. I note\r\nwith pleasure that your diplomatic career includes a term as\r\nAmbassador of Malaysia to my country. The delegation of\r\nPoland will do its best to assist you in your important\r\nfunctions. Let me also pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas do\r\nAmaral, an eminent statesman from Portugal, for the\r\nexcellent manner in which he presided over the work of the\r\nAssembly during its fiftieth anniversary session. May I\r\nalso express the assurance of my highest appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nAs a representative of Poland, a country that has\r\nsuffered so much war, foreign occupation and partition in\r\nits history of more than 1,000 years, I feel entitled to\r\nconvey a simple message: peace is priceless, be it\r\ninternational, with other countries, or internal, among\r\nsocial partners. To endure, peace needs solid economic\r\nfoundations, sustainable development and growth. Yet\r\npeace remains a supreme value and a precondition of life,\r\nrightly recognized from the outset as a principal objective\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMy country’s very recent experience shows that it is\r\npossible to undertake a profound transformation of a\r\nwhole political and economic structure, to defuse a\r\npotential internal conflict through peaceful negotiation.\r\nHaving regained full national sovereignty, we were able\r\nto reshape our foreign policy in accordance with the\r\nnational interest, to reorient it towards the Euro-Atlantic\r\nstructures and to establish and strengthen good-\r\nneighbourly relations with the newly created and/or\r\nprofoundly transformed States that now surround us. Is\r\nthere another country in the world which, in just a few\r\nyears, has seen all of its neighbours, without exception,\r\nchange and not as a result of conflict? Sometimes we hear\r\nopinions on an alleged lack of stability in our region,\r\nCentral Europe. But it is not true. The case of Poland,\r\nwith its stabilizing influence in the region, tells quite a\r\ndifferent story.\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nI am proud to report to you, Mr. President, that we\r\nhave accomplished a lot in the last seven years. Not only\r\nhave we built a sound foundation for a new economic and\r\npolitical system, but we have also succeeded in stopping\r\nour economic decline and have achieved, now for the fourth\r\nyear in a row, a high rate of economic growth, which has\r\nencouraged the media to add the Polish eagle to countries\r\nnicknamed “economic tigers”. This has been achieved\r\nthrough an enormous effort on the part of our people, who\r\nhave proved mature enough to pay the price of economic\r\ntransformation. We have opened up the economy and the\r\ncountry. Tens of millions of tourists are pouring in every\r\nyear, and millions of Poles travel abroad in all directions.\r\nWe have become an attractive place for foreign investment,\r\nwhich exceeds $10 billion, and we are working on further\r\nimproving the conditions in which investment can thrive.\r\nIt is not my intention to minimize the challenges we\r\nstill face. Yet I strongly believe in our future. The time has\r\ncome for Poland, which received help and encouragement\r\nfrom so many countries during its “Solidarity” revolution\r\nand its historic peaceful transformation based on a political\r\nand social contract, to offer its help to other countries that\r\nundertake great processes of transformation. We can share\r\nour experience, the services of our companies, and the work\r\nof our experts in various fields where transformation is a\r\nmust. As an Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) member, Poland is determined to\r\nbecome much more involved than heretofore in assisting\r\nthe developing countries and those in transition.\r\nOur priority in terms of foreign policy is to join the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\r\nEuropean Union. While seeking these memberships, we\r\ntreasure friendly relations and multifaceted cooperation with\r\nour neighbours, Russia among them. At the same time,\r\nPoland is fully conscious of its duty to carry its part of the\r\nobligations as a member of the world community, as\r\nmanifested by our active participation in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and currently as a non-permanent member\r\nof the Security Council. For many years, Poland has\r\ntraditionally been among the 10 States fielding the largest\r\ncontingents in United Nations peace-keeping operations.\r\nPermit me to make a personal remark. I made the\r\nappeal “Let Us Choose the Future” into the slogan for my\r\n1995 election campaign. May I suggest making this\r\nappeal — choosing, and looking into, the future while\r\nlearning from our common past — here in the United\r\nNations? Old enmities and hatred, both among and within\r\nStates, should no longer cast a shadow on the construction\r\nof our common future.\r\nLet me give as an example Poland’s proposal to\r\ndelete from the United Nations Charter the so-called\r\nenemy States clause. Indeed, Poland now has close,\r\nfriendly relations with its long-time adversary, Germany.\r\nAs a tribute to history, we plan to carry out soon joint\r\nmanoeuvres of German and Polish military units, and to\r\ncontemplate establishing a joint Blue Helmets brigade\r\nconsisting of Polish and German soldiers. Would that not\r\nconstitute the best signum temporis possible?\r\nThis Organization is in acute need of reform to adapt\r\nto the challenges of the next century. There is a pressing\r\nneed for the United Nations to confront the future. Its\r\nduty remains to make its Member States aware of global\r\nproblems as they arise, to analyse them, and to help\r\nresolve them through multilateral cooperation. To make\r\nthis happen, much more is needed than the mere\r\nrestructuring of its intergovernmental bodies and the\r\nSecretariat. Bolstering efficiency in carrying out United\r\nNations tasks through rational downsizing where possible\r\nand necessary is not the only major requirement. More\r\nimportantly, it is high time to adapt the United Nations\r\nwork programme through innovation and redeployment.\r\nFor instance, in Poland’s view the United Nations\r\nshould enhance and upgrade its potential in the field of\r\nthe protection of human rights through the establishment\r\nof a General Assembly committee on human rights and\r\nhumanitarian affairs, while merging the existing Second\r\nand Third Committees into an economic and social one,\r\nand through the elaboration by the Secretary-General of\r\nan agenda on human rights. In addition, in a more long-\r\nterm perspective, the creation of a new main body such\r\nas a human rights council might be contemplated.\r\nThe United Nations is expected to help parties in\r\nconflict to reach agreement and achieve a just peace. But\r\npeace-keeping forces are useless if there is no will for\r\npeace in the hearts of fighters. It is necessary to\r\nencourage the easing of ethnic, religious and other\r\ntensions before they erupt, or if they already have, after\r\nresolving the conflict. That is why it is vital to expand\r\npreventive action, including diplomatic efforts and post-\r\nconflict peace-building as well as assistance for\r\nreconstruction and development. We are ready to offer\r\nour diplomats, international lawyers, and social and\r\neconomic development experts for preventive United\r\nNations missions and post-conflict assistance efforts.\r\nAt the same time it seems essential to address the\r\nquestion of United Nations rapid reaction, including rapid-\r\ndeployment potential, both in the headquarters and in the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nfield. We have notified the Secretary-General of our intent\r\nto make available for the rapid reaction component of the\r\nstand-by arrangements our special GROM (Thunder) force,\r\nwhich proved itself in the Haiti operation. Poland considers\r\nit timely to re-focus the Organization’s attention on\r\npreventive diplomacy and rapid-reaction capability. To\r\nprevent as much as possible and react as quickly as\r\npossible — this is what is increasingly needed in\r\ncontemporary conflicts.\r\nIndeed, do we always have to helplessly witness\r\nworldwide bloodshed and misery, so readily served up by\r\nthe media, and only afterwards try to help, when it is too\r\nlate and more costly, when more money brings less benefit\r\nand whereas an earlier joint action could have saved a lot\r\nof blood and tears for so many countries and peoples? Why\r\ndo we not ponder how to substitute a strategy of prevention\r\nand advance action for one of late reaction ex post facto?\r\nThis strategy could go beyond a conservative doctrine of\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security, covering a rapid and\r\nselective reaction to potential threats arising among and\r\nwithin Member States, as well as the consolidation of peace\r\nwhen it is painfully achieved.\r\nI turn now to the crucial issues of the post-cold-war\r\nera: disarmament, arms reduction and averting the spread of\r\narms through non-proliferation. Poland, which now holds\r\nthe presidency of the Conference on Disarmament,\r\nwelcomed with great satisfaction the submission to the\r\nAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nand the adoption of the resolution, of which we were\r\namong the sponsors. We now look forward to the broad\r\nendorsement of the Treaty, which I had the privilege of\r\nsigning this morning. We must not allow the arduous\r\nefforts of so many States to be wasted. While keeping in\r\nmind the need for eventual nuclear disarmament, partial\r\nsteps towards that goal should be given full approval as\r\nthey bring it closer and make the world safer, as would the\r\nentry into force of another important legal instrument: the\r\nchemical weapons Convention. Chemical weapons are\r\nsometimes called the nuclear bombs of the poor.\r\nRecent conflicts, however, have shown that mass\r\ndestruction can also result from conventional arms, the\r\nstockpiles of which have grown enormously. That is why\r\nwe welcome the parallel focus on such arms, including so-\r\ncalled micro-disarmament, and an early total ban on the use\r\nof anti-personnel landmines.\r\nIf the United Nations wants to remain meaningful in\r\nthe key areas of its mandate, to be ahead of events,\r\nforeseeing and not merely reacting, slowly and\r\ninadequately, to what life brings with the astounding pace\r\ntypical of our times, it should grasp and cope with the\r\ninteractive relationship between peace, development and\r\nhuman rights protection.\r\nAll these changes can have the desired effect only in\r\nconditions of sustained financing of programmed\r\nactivities. Political will is not enough. The current\r\nfinancial crisis is propitious neither for the execution of\r\nsuch activities nor for reform. To enable the Organization\r\nto fulfil its statutory tasks and to reform, its financial\r\ncredibility needs to be restored. Member States should not\r\ndiscount innovative ideas for supplementary financing,\r\nwhich could enable more activities to take place,\r\nespecially in support of developing countries, those in\r\ntransition, and conflict-ridden countries. Since\r\nGovernments are more often than not reluctant to increase\r\ntheir dues or their voluntary contributions, or to allow any\r\nform of international taxation on their companies and\r\ncitizens, additional funds could be sought from the private\r\nsector.\r\nFor instance, the idea of a United Nations trust fund\r\nfinanced by tax-free donations, mainly from transnational\r\ncorporations, could be examined. After all, stability\r\ncombined with economic growth and social peace also\r\nbenefit such companies. Should their host Governments\r\ncreate encouraging conditions for them to contribute, such\r\nas common rules for tax reduction, the United Nations\r\nmight acquire additional sources of funding, especially for\r\nhumanitarian and development support activities. Such a\r\nsolution would in no way affect the governmental\r\ncharacter of the Organization if control over the allocation\r\nof the newly acquired additional resources rested with\r\nGovernments, and if no conditionality could be introduced\r\nby donors.\r\nI would now like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to what I consider one of the most important\r\naspects of my statement. I witnessed the terrorist attack at\r\nthe Olympic Games in Atlanta in July, and cannot forget\r\nfaces expressing shock and tragedy.\r\nPoland is a country that has struggled over centuries\r\nfor its own freedom and that of others. We have finally\r\nachieved well-earned greatness and the benefits of\r\ndemocracy. However, our nation is also paying a heavy\r\ntoll for those benefits: open frontiers and increased\r\nmigration of people pose threats to the security and well-\r\nbeing of my compatriots. Organized crime distorts the\r\nimage of democratic societies on a national, regional and\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nglobal plane. To combat it, we need the solidarity of all\r\nStates, and a concerted effort by all of us.\r\nThe international community is faced with the growing\r\nthreat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of\r\ntransnational organized crime and international terrorism,\r\nwhich menace both the material and institutional\r\nfoundations of our societies. What is especially dangerous\r\nfor us and for future generations is that in so many cases\r\nwe have been unable to bring criminals to justice. Justice\r\nhas been neither done nor seen to be done.\r\nI have received reports that my own country, and the\r\nwhole region, faces a steep increase in drug trafficking,\r\nslavery, trade in child sex, and money laundering.\r\nOrganized crime is a worldwide phenomenon. It brings\r\ntragedy and suffering to many — the immediate victims\r\nand other innocent people. But it does more: organized\r\ncrime leads to the creation of illegal associations and\r\nbusinesses that infiltrate and undermine legitimate economic\r\ninterests and political structures. Organized crime is like a\r\nform of corrosion in societies. Organized crime corrupts\r\nStates. Organized crime is a cancer in our communities, a\r\ncancer that we should fight together. Alone, we risk losing\r\nthe battle and endangering our security.\r\nI am convinced that only a worldwide effort under\r\nUnited Nations auspices has any prospect of stopping these\r\ncrimes, which threaten democratic freedoms and democracy\r\nitself. Poland believes, therefore, that the time has come to\r\nmake a concerted international effort to agree on, and\r\naccede to a comprehensive legal instrument: a convention\r\ndesigned to enhance cooperation between States and\r\nfacilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting\r\ntransnational organized crime. I have the privilege to submit\r\nto this Assembly a draft framework convention against\r\norganized crime. It is annexed to the text of my statement,\r\nwhich has been distributed to members.\r\nThe Assembly will note that the draft convention deals\r\nwith illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and\r\nmoney laundering; traffic in persons; counterfeiting\r\ncurrency; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects;\r\nstealing and smuggling nuclear material, and the misuse or\r\nthreat of misuse of such material to harm the public;\r\nterrorist acts; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and\r\nexplosive materials or devices; illicit traffic in or stealing of\r\nmotor vehicles; and corruption of public officials.\r\nThe draft text proposes a system of cooperation\r\nbetween Member States to combat organized crime. It calls\r\nfor States either to punish offenders or to extradite them.\r\nWe ask States to introduce criminal liability for people\r\nwho derive profits from organized crime, wherever such\r\nliability is not already clear. We believe that we should\r\nmake United Nations agencies and regional and global\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations play a\r\ngreater role in combatting organized crime.\r\nThe draft framework convention is by no means\r\ncarved in stone. We call on Member States to discuss and\r\nimprove the text. We hope that the Assembly will\r\ndetermine modalities to assure its speedy and successful\r\nelaboration. I am sure that our common effort will help to\r\nsave our societies from the scourge of organized crime.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nApproaching the end of the century, the planet is\r\nvisibly in turmoil despite the otherwise universally\r\nwelcomed end of East-West confrontation and of the\r\never-present threat of global conflict. Yet even in the\r\nheart of Europe, we are painfully aware of conflicts, wars,\r\ntragedies, massive disasters, famine and serious economic\r\ndifficulties. People often expect the United Nations to\r\noffer a miraculous remedy for all the evils of the world\r\nand to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal\r\nrights of men and women, and of nations large and small.\r\nIf we just adhere to the Charter, the high roads will\r\nbe clear, not only for our time but for the coming century.\r\nWe must not betray the high expectations held of the\r\nUnited Nations. For its part, Poland will not fail to\r\ncontinue to support the Organization. In today’s\r\ninterdependent world, we need a global body to settle our\r\ndifferences and to ensure orderly global governance to\r\navert threats to humanity. There is no point in reinventing\r\nthe wheel. We are able to adapt what we already have to\r\nwhat we need now and in the years to come. In essence,\r\nwe are looking forward to a more united United Nations\r\nwhich has chosen the future. As an original Member\r\nState, Poland stands prepared to contribute its share to\r\nmaking such an endeavour a reality.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Poland for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Aleksander Kwasniewski, President of the\r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Denmark, His Excellency Mr. Niels\r\nHelveg Petersen.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): Encouraging trends can be\r\nseen in many parts of the world following the end of the\r\nEast-West confrontation. Democracy has taken firm root in\r\nmany countries. The improved economic performance of\r\nmany countries is making an important contribution to the\r\nwelfare of peoples.\r\nAt the same time, we still face difficult challenges.\r\nEthnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll\r\nthan earlier international conflicts; grave cases of violations\r\nof human rights occur; the poorest countries are lagging\r\nbehind in economic development; the gap between rich and\r\npoor is growing; and the environment is coming under\r\nincreasing strain. The international community is facing\r\nchallenges going far beyond traditional diplomacy,\r\nchallenges directly affecting the lives of each individual\r\nhuman being. We must create safer and better living\r\nconditions for the individual.\r\nThis year, I will highlight four priority areas: first,\r\npeacekeeping and international security; secondly, human\r\nrights; thirdly, economic and social development; and,\r\nfourthly, the environment. In these areas, common efforts\r\nin the United Nations are imperative.\r\nFirst, international peace: threats against international\r\nsecurity and the rights of peoples must be dealt with in the\r\nUnited Nations. New complex intra-State conflicts have\r\nincreased dramatically. We must learn from the conflicts in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Somalia. Millions of\r\nindividuals have suffered in these conflicts. Through the\r\nelectronic media, the world closely follows the unfolding\r\ntragedies. The hopes of the victims for a peaceful future are\r\nshared by all of us. The United Nations and the\r\ninternational community are expected to provide answers.\r\nWe must focus on the capacity to react directly and\r\nquickly and to prevent crises from getting out of hand.\r\nRapid response can be that which separates failure from\r\nsuccess. The creation of the United Nations standby system\r\nwas an important step in the right direction. We must now\r\ntake it one step further.\r\nThe establishment of a rapidly deployable\r\nheadquarters in the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations will reduce planning time and response time\r\nfor future operations. The planning of new operations\r\ncannot start from scratch every time. Denmark continues\r\nits efforts with like-minded countries to establish a\r\nmultilateral brigade at a state of high readiness within the\r\nstandby system. A well-balanced, pre-planned force\r\nstructure will greatly improve the ability to act quickly\r\nand effectively.\r\nThe need for new conflict strategies was also\r\nunderlined by the Rwanda evaluation initiated by\r\nDenmark.\r\nPreventive diplomacy is called for. Regional\r\norganizations must be strengthened to take on more\r\nresponsibility in preventing conflicts and in post-conflict\r\npeace-building. The United Nations cannot carry the\r\nentire burden itself. The regional organizations must assist\r\nthe United Nations, not replace it.\r\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE), which I shall have the honour and\r\nresponsibility of chairing in 1997, is one such important\r\nregional organization. One of the tenets of the OSCE is\r\n“OSCE first”. This implies that the OSCE will be a\r\nprimary instrument for conflict prevention in its region,\r\nthus relieving the United Nations.\r\nArms control and arms reduction add their\r\ncontribution to conflict prevention. Two and a half years\r\nof intensive negotiations have resulted in the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) now\r\nopen for signature. On behalf of the Kingdom of\r\nDenmark, I signed the Treaty this morning. The CTBT\r\nwill end the qualitative development of nuclear weapons.\r\nIt is a necessary supplementary component to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It will\r\nstrengthen progress towards complete global nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nWhen it comes to conventional weapons, anti-\r\npersonnel landmines continue to pose a daily, grave threat\r\nto people in many parts of the world. They are, at the\r\nsame time, an unacceptable obstacle to the resettlement of\r\ndisplaced populations. The new landmine Protocol to the\r\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons, adopted in May, is an\r\nimprovement. Denmark will ratify it shortly, without\r\nreservations, but we are still far away from the only\r\nviable solution to the landmine problem, which is a total,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nworldwide ban. The Danish Government has decided to\r\nrenounce unilaterally the use of anti-personnel landmines in\r\nthe Danish armed forces. We encourage similar decisions\r\nby other Governments.\r\nFurthermore, the present state of technology for\r\ndetecting unexploded mines is ineffective. Public and\r\nprivate initiative, ingenuity and funding must be combined\r\nto create new technological options for landmine detection.\r\nThe International Conference on Mine-clearance\r\nTechnology, held in Denmark in July this year, has\r\nstimulated this endeavour. We welcome the initiatives of\r\nCanada and Japan to carry the efforts further.\r\nNational initiatives must be assisted by international\r\nefforts to speed up mine clearance. To this effect, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will be presented with a draft resolution\r\non assistance in mine clearance.\r\nMy second priority is human rights. They have come\r\nto play a visible role in international relations and on the\r\nagenda of many United Nations forums. The Vienna World\r\nConference on Human Rights made it clear that the\r\npromotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimate\r\nconcern, indeed a duty, of all States and the international\r\ncommunity. Criticism of human rights abuses can no longer\r\nbe rejected as interference in internal affairs. Indeed,\r\ncriticism should be seen as a contribution to our cooperative\r\nefforts to strengthen respect for human rights. The adoption\r\nof international instruments is the result of our cooperation.\r\nThey are the true universally-accepted bases for continued\r\nprogress in the human rights field.\r\nThe overall goal is to promote and protect the rights\r\nof individual human beings — our citizens. This leaves\r\nroom for each society to find its own way to further\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. No one is trying\r\nto impose a single model. When we freely adhere to\r\ninternational human rights standards as our own, we give\r\nup no part of our culture, no part of our national\r\nsovereignty. On the contrary, individuals enjoying full\r\nhuman rights are the best guarantee of national culture and\r\nsovereignty.\r\nThe United Nations Commission on Human Rights\r\nplays a particularly important role in the promotion of\r\nhuman rights. During its membership term, Denmark\r\nintends to contribute actively to the Commission’s work in\r\nfour prime areas: the fight against torture; the promotion of\r\nthe rights of indigenous peoples; strengthening the High\r\nCommissioner and his office; and the right to development.\r\nLet me in this context pay tribute to the important\r\ncontribution of non-governmental organizations.\r\nI cannot mention the area of human rights without\r\nreferring to the grave situation in Myanmar. It is, indeed,\r\na tragedy that, since the release in July last year of Nobel\r\nPeace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, developments in\r\nthat country have gone from bad to worse.\r\nTime and again, Denmark and its European Union\r\npartners have urged the State Law and Order Restoration\r\nCouncil (SLORC) to respect human rights and to restore\r\ndemocracy to the Burmese people. Our appeals have been\r\nignored. I repeat them here in the strongest possible\r\nterms. This tragedy must end.\r\nI express my deep dismay at the unwillingness of the\r\nSLORC to discuss the death in custody, on 22 June 1996\r\nof Mr. James Nichols. Mr. Nichols served as honorary\r\nconsul for several European States, including Denmark.\r\nThe Government of Denmark intends to keep the\r\nsituation in Burma high on the international agenda until\r\nfundamental improvements are seen.\r\nEconomic and social development is the third area\r\nI want to emphasize. Human conflicts have many causes.\r\nIf we want a lasting foundation for peace in our own\r\nsocieties and internationally, we need to address the\r\nproblems of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion.\r\nThe plight of the poorest countries is a matter of\r\nparticular concern. The United Nations should play a\r\ncrucial role in addressing this problem.\r\nThe need for development assistance is as great as\r\never. The poorest countries do not attract private\r\ninvestment. They do not have the potential to benefit from\r\nliberalization of international trade. The current trend in\r\nofficial development assistance is deplorable. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance fell to 0.27 per cent of gross\r\nnational product in 1995. This is the lowest level since\r\nthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent was set in 1970.\r\nUnfortunately, a number of major donors are still\r\nreducing their development programmes. In 1995, only\r\nfour countries were above the target of 0.7 per cent.\r\nDenmark, for its part, continues to contribute one per cent\r\nof its gross national product.\r\nEconomic growth, desirable as it is, cannot be\r\nequated with development unless it is accompanied by\r\neconomic and social progress for all groups. Social\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nprogress for all is not an automatic result of economic\r\ngrowth. The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted\r\nby the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development\r\nstated that\r\n“the eradication of poverty, the generation of ...\r\nproductive employment, and the enhancement of social\r\nintegration” (A/CONF.166/9, p. 24)\r\nshould be an integral part of policies furthering economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nI would particularly emphasize the need to ensure an\r\neffective follow-up to the Platform for Action adopted at\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.\r\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in\r\nhumanitarian assistance. Recent experience, including the\r\nRwanda evaluation, has stressed the need for coordination\r\nof all actors in the humanitarian field. The Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs of the United Nations has gradually\r\nestablished itself as a focal point for coordination of needs\r\nassessment and appeals. I urge all Members of the United\r\nNations family with humanitarian assistance programmes to\r\nengage actively in DHA-sponsored coordination efforts.\r\nThe fourth priority area is the environment. The\r\nBrundtland Report and the Rio Conference on Environment\r\nand Development clearly emphasized the global nature of\r\nenvironmental issues. The concept of sustainable\r\ndevelopment has now firmly taken its place on our political\r\nagenda.\r\nMuch has been achieved. Yet it is uncertain whether\r\nthe accomplishments match the growing problems. Armed\r\nconflicts, poverty, ignorance and in some cases even short-\r\nsightedness and greed are contributors to the continued\r\nwear and tear on the environment.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly, to take\r\nplace in 1997, will be the next opportunity for Governments\r\nto review at a high level the implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nThe special session must look at the need for readjusting,\r\nrevitalizing and increasing our efforts to cope with the\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe Government of Denmark fully supports this\r\nprocess. We will continue our support of activities in areas\r\nin need, such as safeguarding biodiversity, promoting\r\nrenewable energy and reducing erosion, desertification and\r\ndeforestation.\r\nI have dealt briefly with four high-priority areas. In\r\nthe view of my Government, the United Nations has a\r\nkey role to play in addressing these problems. But is the\r\nOrganization fully capable of taking up this challenge?\r\nRegrettably, the answer is no.\r\nWe must insist that all Members honour their treaty\r\nobligations and pay their contributions to the United\r\nNations in full, on time and without preconditions. The\r\npresent state of affairs is unacceptable. Undermining the\r\nUnited Nations is in the interest of no one. Members that\r\nare intentionally running behind in paying their assessed\r\ncontributions must realize that they cannot expect their\r\ninfluence in the various United Nations organs to remain\r\nunaffected.\r\nFurthermore, the United Nations must reflect present\r\npolitical realities. This should be borne in mind in the\r\nefforts to agree on reforming the Security Council. No\r\ndoubt, the United Nations must continue its efforts to\r\nrevitalize itself in the economic and social field. The\r\nquality of its work must continuously be improved. The\r\nmain objective is to increase its impact at the country\r\nlevel to the benefit of the poor. Denmark supports a\r\ncomprehensive and coherent reform of the present system\r\nin areas such as institutions, governance structure, staff,\r\nadministration and future funding.\r\nLittle can be achieved without the political will of\r\nthe Member States. I agree with the recent findings of a\r\ntask force sponsored by a well-known American\r\ninstitution, the Council on Foreign Relations. It states that\r\n“the United Nations is in crisis ... principally\r\nbecause Members States ... have failed to pay their\r\nbills, have given the United Nations responsibilities\r\nwithout the power to carry them out, and have\r\nblamed the United Nations for failures in national\r\npolicies.”\r\nIn conclusion, let me underline the fundamental\r\ninterest of my country in the establishment of a world\r\ncommunity in which States, as well as each individual,\r\nmay live in conditions of peace and welfare. Well-\r\nfunctioning international organizations, not least our world\r\nOrganization, are cornerstones in this endeavour.\r\nDenmark will bring its dedicated contribution.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\na statement by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nMr. Ryutaro Hashimoto, Prime Minister of Japan, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister of Japan, His Excellency Mr.\r\nRyutaro Hashimoto, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Hashimoto (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): I should like, first of all,\r\nto extend my warmest compliments to His Excellency Mr.\r\nRazali Ismail, Permanent Representative of Malaysia to the\r\nUnited Nations, on his assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly last week. I also pay tribute to the\r\nefforts of His Excellency Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral,\r\nwho demonstrated great skill in presiding over the historic\r\nfiftieth-anniversary session.\r\nLast year commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of\r\nJapan’s admission to the United Nations. Over the past four\r\ndecades, Japan has consistently made its commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations one of the main pillars of its foreign policy\r\nand has steadfastly supported the United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, Japan has benefited immensely from\r\nthe international system, including the United Nations. I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to express my sincere\r\ngratitude for the support Japan has received from the\r\ninternational community in building the stability and\r\nprosperity it enjoys today. In addition, as the role of the\r\nUnited Nations grows in importance in the new post-cold-\r\nwar environment, I hereby affirm that Japan is resolved to\r\nplay a more active role by further strengthening the\r\ncooperation it extends to the Organization for the sake of\r\nworld peace and prosperity.\r\nMy ultimate foreign policy goal is the creation of a\r\nbetter world for future generations, a world free of poverty\r\nand conflict. I intend to achieve this goal through change\r\nand creation, which is the mission of my Cabinet. Children\r\nwho can talk vividly about their dreams of the future are\r\nthe world’s treasure. Is it not our grave responsibility, as\r\nleaders of the international community, to build an\r\nenvironment in which the children of the next generation\r\ncan flourish?\r\nEfforts towards the creation of a better world for\r\nfuture generations must be based on the following three\r\npillars: first, securing world peace and stability; secondly,\r\npromoting development so as to bring growth and stability\r\nto developing countries; and thirdly, ensuring the well-being\r\nof each and every citizen throughout global society. These\r\nthree pillars are interrelated, and we will be unable to\r\nachieve a world free of poverty and conflict if any one of\r\nthe three is missing, or if only one of them is in place.\r\nSince taking office, I have pursued foreign policies\r\nbased on the strong belief that Japan should be a nation\r\nthat works for world peace and stability on its own\r\ninitiative. In accordance with this position, Japan intends\r\nto play a leading role in the building of each of these\r\nthree pillars, as I shall subsequently explain. These are\r\nprecisely the areas which the United Nations of the\r\ntwenty-first century will be expected to address.\r\nThe first pillar is securing world peace and stability.\r\nThis is surely of the utmost importance, because unless\r\nthis is achieved, future generations will be left with\r\nnothing but confusion and destruction. At this time of\r\never greater interdependence, world peace is indivisible.\r\nInstability in one region can readily lead to the instability\r\nof other regions and, in turn, to the instability of the\r\nworld as a whole. It is Japan’s intention not simply to\r\nsecure its own peace and stability but, consonant with the\r\nphilosophy embodied in the Constitution of Japan, it will\r\nstrive to secure global peace and stability and make\r\ngreater efforts, commensurate with its political and\r\neconomic status, for the prevention and resolution of\r\nconflicts in various regions of the world.\r\nIt goes without saying that, as a nation in Asia,\r\nJapan will spare no effort in securing peace and stability\r\nin the region. The recent incident of infiltration by a\r\nNorth Korean submarine makes us all the more aware of\r\nthe importance of easing tensions on the Korean\r\npeninsula. Realization of the four-party meeting, which\r\nwas proposed by the leaders of the United States and the\r\nRepublic of Korea last April, is very important, and I\r\nshould like on this occasion to reiterate Japan’s support\r\nfor that proposal. In an effort to further strengthen the\r\nachievements of the Cambodian peace process, which has\r\nproved to be a successful example of the international\r\ncommunity’s peace-building efforts, and looking ahead to\r\nthe elections that Cambodia will hold on its own for the\r\nfirst time beginning next year, Japan intends to continue\r\nto extend assistance to that country. Japan welcomes the\r\nfact that Russia, also located in the Asian region, is\r\ncontinuing its reform process in the light of the results of\r\nthe recent presidential election. Moreover, by actively\r\nparticipating in political and security dialogue, for\r\nexample in the context of the ASEAN Regional Forum,\r\nJapan is endeavouring to further promote confidence-\r\nbuilding in the region.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nAt the same time, Japan is actively engaged in\r\naddressing issues in other regions, for example by\r\ncooperating with United Nations activities to foster global\r\npeace. During the latter part of August I visited five\r\ncountries in Latin America where I witnessed at first hand\r\nthe success of the democratization process and steady\r\nprogress in economic reform. Japan intends to strengthen its\r\nassistance for the stable development of this region.\r\nIn the former Yugoslavia, Japan has contributed both\r\npersonnel and financing to the local and national elections\r\nrecently held in Bosnia in view of their importance in the\r\nformation of a democratic political system. As a member of\r\nthe Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council,\r\nJapan will continue to participate actively in the civilian\r\naspects of international efforts towards the implementation\r\nof the peace process.\r\nOn the occasion of Foreign Minister Ikeda’s visit to\r\nthe Middle East in August, and Chairman Arafat’s visit to\r\nTokyo in mid-September, Japan called for continued\r\nnegotiations among the parties to the Middle East peace\r\nprocess. Japan is determined to continue to contribute to the\r\ncreation of an environment conducive to the advancement\r\nof the peace process by extending assistance to the parties\r\nconcerned, including assistance to the Palestinian people,\r\nand by participating in multilateral talks.\r\nJapan is gravely concerned about the current situation\r\nin Iraq. It strongly hopes that Iraq will listen to the opinion\r\nof the international community and comply in good faith\r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions so that the\r\nsituation will be settled as soon as possible.\r\nIn order to resolve the Afghanistan issue it is\r\nimportant that foreign interference cease and that the\r\nsuccess of the peace and reconciliation efforts of the United\r\nNations is ensured. Toward that end, Japan is providing an\r\nexpert on that region to serve as a political counsellor at the\r\nUnited Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan.\r\nThe ongoing regional conflicts in Africa, including the\r\nsituations in Burundi, Liberia and Angola, are of grave\r\nconcern. The international community must actively support\r\nthe conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution efforts of\r\nAfrican countries as well as the strengthening of their\r\ncapabilities in this regard. In addition to extending financial\r\ncontributions to the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\r\nCentral Africa, Japan is extending assistance to\r\npeacekeeping operations, refugee assistance, rehabilitation\r\nassistance, and assistance for democratization in the form\r\nof personnel and intellectual input.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are an effective complement\r\nto the collective security function as originally envisaged\r\nin the United Nations Charter, and they supplement the\r\nconflict-resolution efforts of the parties themselves. It is\r\nimportant that the international community should\r\ncontinue to support peacekeeping operations but also that\r\nit should seek their further reform. Experiences in recent\r\nyears have reaffirmed the effectiveness of traditional\r\npeacekeeping operations. Their role in preventing\r\nconflicts, as exemplified by the success of the United\r\nNations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), is\r\nlikely to become increasingly important. Japan will\r\ncontinue to participate in the discussions that are now\r\nunder way among interested Member States on measures\r\nto improve the rapid reaction capabilities of the\r\npeacekeeping operations. Japan is participating in the\r\nUnited Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)\r\nin the Golan Heights and intends hereafter to cooperate\r\nactively and as much as possible in peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nI believe that, as it responds to regional conflicts, the\r\nUnited Nations has the potential to fulfil, in a practical\r\nmanner, an extremely effective function through\r\npreventive diplomacy. I should like to propose that a\r\nmeeting of eminent persons be convened to explore\r\nmeans of enhancing the Organization’s preventive\r\ndiplomacy capability.\r\nIn order to maintain international peace and stability,\r\nit is essential to further promote disarmament efforts and\r\nto strengthen the regime for the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. In particular, Japan would\r\nvigorously emphasize the importance for the international\r\ncommunity of promoting realistic and steady efforts for\r\nnuclear disarmament with the aim of realizing a world\r\nfree of nuclear weapons. As the only country to have\r\nsuffered nuclear devastation, Japan has been making\r\nprecisely this appeal to the international community as a\r\ntop priority in accordance with its own philosophy.\r\nThus I am deeply gratified by the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by the General\r\nAssembly with the support of many Member States; this\r\nindeed marks a historic step towards a world free of\r\nnuclear weapons. Having the opportunity just this\r\nmorning to sign the Treaty gave me great personal\r\nsatisfaction. In order to realize the early entry into force\r\nof the Treaty, Japan would like to call upon those\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\ncountries which have expressed opposition to the Treaty to\r\naccede to it at the earliest possible date from the broader\r\nperspective of promoting nuclear disarmament. For its part,\r\nJapan will continue to make contributions in the field of\r\nverification of nuclear testing, by such means as expanding\r\nthe technical cooperation on seismic technologies that it\r\nextends to concerned developing countries. As a next step\r\ntowards the elimination of nuclear weapons, I should like\r\nto call for the early commencement of negotiations on a\r\ncut-off treaty which would prohibit the production of fissile\r\nmaterials for nuclear weapons.\r\nJapan takes the problems posed by landmines very\r\nseriously. Japan supports international efforts toward a total,\r\nworldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines. Furthermore,\r\nin order to reinforce international support for measures to\r\ndeal with anti-personnel landmines, Japan is preparing to\r\nhost a meeting at the senior official level in Tokyo early\r\nnext year.\r\nThe promotion of development to bring about the\r\ngrowth and stability of developing countries is the second\r\npillar required for the creation of a better world for future\r\ngenerations. Development is a prerequisite for peace; at the\r\nsame time, the maintenance of peace is a precondition for\r\ndevelopment. As a leading donor, Japan will work to\r\nfurther enhance its official development assistance; at the\r\nsame time, it is keenly aware of its responsibility to lead\r\nthe discussion on issues relating to the proper form and\r\nprovision of such assistance.\r\nBased on this recognition, Japan has been calling for\r\na new development strategy. The central ideas in this\r\nstrategy are an emphasis on the ownership by developing\r\ncountries of the development process and on the\r\nestablishment of a new global partnership in which\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, released from the\r\nNorth-South confrontational mind-set, cooperate with each\r\nother. Moreover, it is important to address development not\r\nsimply with official development assistance, but also by\r\norganically combining various elements including trade,\r\ninvestment, economic policy, debt relief, technology\r\ntransfer, and the development of social infrastructure. It is\r\nalso important to extend assistance that is most appropriate\r\nto the circumstances of the particular country while paying\r\nadequate attention to the efforts made by developing\r\ncountries in the promotion of democratization and the\r\nintroduction of market-oriented economies. Furthermore,\r\nJapan attaches importance to the setting of development\r\ntargets and the reinvestment in development activities of\r\nsavings resulting from reforms, as well as to promoting\r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions.\r\nWe have witnessed the development of various\r\nforms of regional cooperation, such as the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, MERCOSUR, and the\r\nSouth Pacific Forum; such regional cooperation is an\r\nimportant element for development. Emphasizing the\r\nsignificance of South-South cooperation, Japan is utilizing\r\nthe Japanese Human Resources Development Fund in the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in\r\norder to support South-South cooperation.\r\nIn the context of developing countries, Japan\r\nattaches particular importance to the development of\r\nAfrica, where poverty and conflict are particularly acute.\r\nJapan will actively promote its initiatives on assistance to\r\nAfrican countries, which Foreign Minister Ikeda presented\r\nduring the general debate of the Ninth United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development, convened in\r\nSouth Africa this past spring. In order to give new\r\nmomentum to African development, Japan is hoping to\r\nconvene the second meeting of the Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development in 1998, which\r\nwould follow a preparatory meeting that will take place,\r\nalso in Tokyo, in 1997.\r\nThe third pillar to which I would like to refer is the\r\nguarantee of the well-being of every citizen of the global\r\ncommunity. It is important to embrace the global\r\ncommunity as a whole, and to give heed to the\r\nimportance of each and every one of its members. Indeed,\r\nthe peace of mind of individuals contributes to the peace\r\nand stability of the world.\r\nJapan intends to address more actively various social\r\nproblems such as the environment, population, AIDS,\r\ndrugs, terrorism, organized crime, refugees and the status\r\nof women, as well as problems relating to food and\r\nenergy, which may become more acute in the years to\r\ncome. Concerned about environmental issues, Japan will\r\nhost the third conference of the parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in\r\nKyoto in December next year. Japan will make every\r\neffort toward the adoption at that conference of an\r\neffective and practical document prescribing an\r\ninternational framework to prevent global warming after\r\nthe year 2000. I should like to call for the valuable\r\ncooperation of every Member State and international\r\norganization concerned for the success of that conference.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nRecognizing that it is important that each and every\r\nhuman being be cared for, throughout more than 30 years\r\nof political activity, I have focused my attention on the\r\nprotection of the most vulnerable among us and to the\r\nelimination of poverty. The Initiative for a Caring World\r\nwhich I proposed on the occasion of the Lyons summit of\r\nthe Group of Seven is an extension of this endeavour.\r\nUnder this initiative, Japan intends, first of all, to share\r\nwith developing countries its experiences in the field of\r\nsocial security, including health care, hygiene and social\r\nwelfare services so that they can develop more effective\r\nservices in these areas, and secondly, to exchange\r\nexperiences and knowledge with other developed countries\r\nwith respect to issues that they commonly confront.\r\nAs I stated at the outset, I should like to urge world\r\nleaders to join hands and strengthen their efforts\r\nparticularly on behalf of the well-being of children. Ever\r\nsince the Japan Committee for the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) was established in 1955, my\r\nmother has been dedicating herself to promoting its\r\nactivities. This has had a profound influence on me, and I\r\ntoo have been actively engaged in its activities. Japan has\r\nbeen contributing approximately $30 million to UNICEF\r\nannually and it intends hereafter to strengthen its\r\ncooperation. As part of its initiatives on assistance to Africa\r\nwhich I mentioned earlier, Japan announced that it would\r\nprovide assistance for the expansion of education and the\r\neradication of polio on that continent. It also intends to\r\nenhance its assistance for the protection of the health of\r\nvery young children in developing countries.\r\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is the\r\nfoundation of world peace and prosperity. Japan is\r\ndetermined to support the democratic development of\r\ndeveloping countries and at the same time hopes that the\r\nUnited Nations will further enhance its activities in the field\r\nof human rights.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, it is essential\r\nthat the United Nations itself play a role that responds\r\nadequately to the growing expectations of the international\r\ncommunity based on the three pillars to which I have been\r\nreferring. Towards that end, reforms that strengthen the\r\nfunctions of the Organization are necessary. There is a\r\nconsensus among the United Nations membership regarding\r\nthe importance of the new role envisaged for the\r\nOrganization as well as the urgent need for comprehensive\r\nUnited Nations reform. However, when it comes to\r\nconcrete measures for reform, a convergence of views\r\namong Member States is yet to emerge.\r\nWith the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nwe witnessed an increase in the momentum for reform. It\r\nshould be the aim of this fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly to maintain this momentum so that a general\r\nagreement on the major elements of reform can be\r\nreached before the session ends. The entire United\r\nNations membership should then make every effort to\r\nreach an agreement on concrete measures to realize\r\nUnited Nations reform in the near future. If the United\r\nNations simply engages in repetitious debate and proves\r\nincapable of reforming itself to adapt to the changing\r\ntimes, its very credibility could be severely undermined.\r\nIt is thus incumbent upon the membership as a whole to\r\nbe tenacious in its efforts to achieve reform.\r\nSecurity Council reform, and reforms in\r\nadministrative and financial areas and in economic and\r\nsocial areas comprise the threefold centrepiece of United\r\nNations reform. I should like to point out the importance,\r\nabove all, of carrying out these reforms as a whole in a\r\nbalanced manner. For example, even though there may be\r\na financial crisis, if we were to carry out reforms in that\r\narea alone, separately from reforms in the other two\r\nareas, it would not correspond to the original basic\r\nconcept of United Nations reform, which was to seek to\r\nstrengthen the functions of the Organization as a whole.\r\nPermit me to present the views of Japan regarding\r\nreforms in these three areas. I should like first of all to\r\ndiscuss the reform of the Security Council. Inasmuch as\r\nthe Security Council bears the primary responsibility for\r\ncarrying out the major purpose of the United Nations,\r\nnamely, the achievement and maintenance of world peace\r\nand stability, its importance is obvious. As it has\r\nindicated on previous occasions, Japan, with the\r\nendorsement of many other countries, is prepared to\r\ndischarge its responsibilities as a permanent member of\r\nthe Security Council in accordance with its basic\r\nphilosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited\r\nby its Constitution.\r\nUntil the reform of the Security Council is realized,\r\nJapan is determined to contribute to the work of the\r\nSecurity Council for the sake of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and has presented its candidature for non-\r\npermanent membership on the Council in this session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Responding to the strong support\r\nand confidence that have already been expressed with\r\nrespect to its candidature, Japan will continue to make\r\nevery effort so that it can play an active role on the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nAs I stated earlier, Japan attaches great importance to\r\ndevelopment. More than two thirds of United Nations\r\nMember States are developing countries. If the United\r\nNations is to aim at achieving a world free of poverty and\r\nconflicts, it is crucial that discussions on development be\r\nfurther promoted within the Organization. In this, the\r\nfunctions and role of the Economic and Social Council\r\nshould be strengthened and the integration of the various\r\ndevelopment issues with which the United Nations is\r\nengaged should be ensured.\r\nJapan is the second largest financial contributor to the\r\nUnited Nations; its assessment for the regular budget has\r\nincreased to 15.65 per cent for next year, and is likely to\r\nincrease further. Japan will not shirk the tremendous\r\nresponsibility it bears in financially supporting the United\r\nNations. However, with respect to the scale of assessment,\r\nI wish to reiterate that Japan attaches importance not only\r\nto the concept of capacity to pay but also to the\r\nresponsibility to pay. Japan also welcomes the endeavours\r\nof the Secretariat towards administrative streamlining and\r\nrationalizing.\r\nThroughout the four decades since it joined the United\r\nNations Japan has faithfully upheld the purposes and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It has\r\nconsistently attached importance to the United Nations, and\r\nit is proud to be among the countries that have made the\r\ngreatest contributions to its overall activities. Disarmament,\r\ninitiatives in the area of nuclear non-proliferation, an appeal\r\nfor a new strategy on development issues, an active\r\naddressing of global issues, as well as considerable\r\nfinancial contributions to the United Nations — these are\r\nthe issues to which Japan has attached profound importance\r\nin recent years.\r\nI wish to conclude my statement in this general debate\r\nby reemphasizing Japan’s readiness to participate in the\r\nSecurity Council, which is at the centre of United Nations\r\nactivity, as well as to engage more actively and more\r\nconstructively in the aforementioned areas of endeavour in\r\norder to discharge its responsibility with regard to world\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ryutaro Hashimoto, Prime Minister of Japan, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call upon the Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs of Canada, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Lloyd Axworthy.\r\nMr. Axworthy (Canada): I am happy to join other\r\nspeakers in warmly congratulating His Excellency Mr.\r\nRazali Ismail on his assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to express Canada’s deep\r\nappreciation of the excellent manner in which Mr. Freitas\r\ndo Amaral managed the deliberations of the fiftieth\r\nsession of the Assembly.\r\nForty years ago, in the depths of the cold war, the\r\nGeneral Assembly authorized the setting up of a\r\npeacekeeping force in Suez. Thus emerged an important\r\ntool for the international community, one that has since\r\nserved the cause of peace in many different forms around\r\nthe world.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanadians take special pride in peacekeeping\r\nbecause the concept was developed in part by their\r\nForeign Minister, Lester B. Pearson, who received the\r\nNobel Peace Prize for his efforts.\r\nAs we reflect on the fortieth anniversary of United\r\nNations peacekeeping, there are certain conclusions to be\r\ndrawn. The United Nations has played a crucial role\r\nthroughout the world by dint of its peacekeeping role.\r\nInnovation is both necessary and possible within the\r\nUnited Nations, and in our time, different as it may be,\r\nthe spirit of internationalism, of commitment to\r\ncooperation, calls to us once again.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn a new and changing global environment\r\ninternationalism is ever more important for all nations,\r\nlarge or small, weak or powerful. Changing times have\r\nset for us a new broad agenda, which includes focusing\r\non the security needs of individuals — in other words, on\r\nsustainable human security. Unfortunately, the new times\r\nhave not sufficiently been reflected by a rededication to\r\nthe United Nations as an expression of the spirit of\r\ninternationalism. There remains too often a tendency to\r\nact according to old power configurations rather than to\r\nseek out collective approaches that address the roots of\r\nconflict and attempt to resolve them through common\r\naction.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nThe need for recommitment to the United Nations is\r\nclear, and so too is the need for the renewal, restructuring\r\nand refocusing of the Organization and its various bodies\r\nand agencies. In implementing this agenda of United\r\nNations renewal we will no doubt encounter difficulties and\r\ndifferences of opinion. But this should not discourage us.\r\nWe need the courage to innovate on two fronts, grappling\r\nwith a new and complex world agenda and restructuring the\r\nUnited Nations to respond effectively to that agenda.\r\nThe basic mandate of the United Nations at its\r\nfounding was the prevention of international conflict. As\r\npeacekeeping has changed over time, one can see the\r\nevolution of a security agenda itself, from being a simple\r\nbuffer between States to an international responsibility for\r\nmaintaining order and an involvement in reconstruction.\r\nThe range of activities in recent times has been impressive,\r\nfrom Haiti to Cambodia, from the Golan Heights to El\r\nSalvador, from Bosnia to the peace accords now being\r\nsigned in Guatemala.\r\nThat range demonstrates that the international response\r\nto threats to security has gone well beyond the initial\r\ndefinition, which was limited to dealing with cross-border\r\naggression. Rather, in a continuum of threats, there is an\r\nincreasing focus on conflicts that take place within borders\r\nbut that have severe ripple effects throughout the entire\r\ninternational system. These types of conflict are still, in\r\npeacekeeping terms, largely uncharted waters, and of course\r\nthere are differences of view on how best to respond.\r\nWhat is clear is the need for a new tool kit for the\r\nUnited Nations to respond to a variety of different\r\nsituations. In this context I am glad to note that most of the\r\nrecommendations made in the rapid-reaction study\r\nsubmitted by Canada last year are now being implemented.\r\nCanada will continue to support United Nations efforts to\r\nestablish a headquarters that will enhance its ability to\r\nrespond rapidly and with flexibility. But that is only one\r\ntool. Many more are needed, especially in the area of\r\nprevention of disputes and in the arduous and complex task\r\nof peace-building.\r\nThe failure of conflict prevention in Rwanda, as\r\noutlined in the Rwanda evaluation report, has made\r\nabundantly clear the need to enlarge the concept of peace-\r\nbuilding to embrace prevention as well as peacemaking and\r\nreconstruction. Preventive action will require much greater\r\ncommitment from United Nations Members to intervene\r\nearly.\r\nIn Canada, we are currently focusing our approach\r\nto these issues. We have started reworking our own\r\ninternational tool kit to improve our ability to initiate and\r\nsupport peace-building operations in areas such as\r\nmediation, dialogue, human-rights monitoring, judicial\r\nreform, police training and demobilization of military\r\nforces. We look forward to cooperating with other nations\r\nthat are also exploring similar innovative approaches.\r\nThe search for new tools and the means to utilize\r\nthem collectively cannot, however, be a substitute for the\r\nreinforcement of existing mechanisms to build peace. We\r\nare about to take a historic step forward on the nuclear-\r\ndisarmament agenda. Today, the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty was opened for signature. That Treaty is\r\nthe result of decades of hope and effort by people around\r\nthe world. This morning I signed the Treaty on behalf of\r\nCanada. We call upon all States Members of the United\r\nNations to do the same.\r\nThe children of tomorrow should, we hope, never\r\nhave to know what a nuclear test is. If we can succeed in\r\nthis goal, and if we can vigorously pursue the goal of\r\nsystematically and progressively reducing nuclear\r\nweapons, with the ultimate goal of their elimination, we\r\ncan ensure that those children know less and less about\r\nthe most terrible scourge to face humanity.\r\nIf the world can focus its energies on ending the\r\ntesting of sophisticated and expensive nuclear weapons,\r\nwe believe that there is real hope for setting ourselves the\r\ngoal of ending the use of the most simple, cheap and, on\r\na daily basis, most destructive weapon in use today, the\r\nanti-personnel landmine.\r\nWe have all witnessed the suffering, death and\r\nhorrifying mutilation caused by mines. Canada, along\r\nwith many other countries and organizations, is engaged\r\nin mine-clearance operations. But the simple fact is that\r\nanti-personnel mines are being laid far faster then we can\r\npull them out of the ground. This is not just a\r\ndisarmament issue. It strikes at the very heart of\r\ndevelopment, and the thousands upon thousands of\r\nvictims affected every year pose a stark challenge to\r\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping efforts.\r\nCanada will host an international strategy session\r\nthis autumn, bringing together like-minded Governments,\r\ninternational agencies and non-governmental groups to\r\nprovide impetus and direction to international efforts\r\ntowards a global ban on anti-personnel mines. I hope this\r\nwill help to catalyse efforts to build a consensus on a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nstrong, forward-looking resolution for this fifty-first session.\r\nAs such, it can provide further impetus to multilateral\r\nnegotiations on a full global ban.\r\nMr. Turnquest (Bahamas), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nA third milestone in this area is the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention, the first international treaty that aims\r\nto introduce a complete, global ban on an entire category of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. It is of the greatest\r\nimportance that it be brought into force as soon as possible.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nDuring the cold war, we re-examined and redefined\r\nthe dimensions of international security to embrace the\r\nconcept of sustainable human security. The rule of law and\r\ngood governance are as important to maintaining global\r\npeace as disarmament measures. We are also coming to\r\nrealize that real security cannot be guaranteed by the State\r\nalone, but must involve civil society as well.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThese realizations stemmed in part from a growing\r\nsense of insecurity at the newly emerging but deadly threats\r\nof what one writer has described as “the underside of\r\nglobalization”, including environmental degradation, crime\r\nand terrorism, and a lack of equity between the peoples of\r\nthe Earth.\r\nThe recent series of United Nations conferences has\r\nserved both to define the concept of sustainable human\r\nsecurity and to bring home the growing challenges to the\r\nsecurity of the individual. The road map is clear; we do not\r\nneed to study it any further. Now is the time to move\r\nforward in a concerted, comprehensive way.\r\nThere are already notable examples of what the United\r\nNations system has achieved, such as programmes to\r\nimprove children’s health and strategies to combat such\r\nenvironmental threats as depletion of the ozone layer.\r\nBut as important as these advances are, there remain\r\nfar too many paper commitments instead of real progress\r\non the ground. Currently we are swamped by a plethora of\r\nagendas, blueprints and plans that run the risk of exhausting\r\nthe ability of donor nations to respond to or have a real\r\nimpact on those most in need. Too many bodies are\r\nestablished to implement these plans, creating jurisdictional\r\nconfusion and an overlap in implementation. We need to\r\nrecognize that in the realm of sustainable human security,\r\nGovernments are not alone. The groups and networks that\r\nhave emerged around the world representing women,\r\nindigenous peoples and children, along with business and\r\nfinance, are now major players, and we need a system of\r\ngovernance that recognizes this and brings them into\r\npartnership with Governments themselves.\r\nOne example of a new system is the Arctic Council,\r\nwhich was inaugurated in Ottawa last week. This\r\nmultilateral regional body brings together Arctic nations\r\nand indigenous groups to cooperate in the sustainable\r\ndevelopment and environmental protection of a unique\r\nand precious part of the globe. The Council represents a\r\nnew model of international organization, bringing together\r\npeople and States to share their energy and resources in\r\na common cause.\r\nThe upcoming World Food Summit organized by the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO) provides another opportunity to combine\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental efforts. As a major\r\nagricultural producer, Canada looks forward to working\r\nwith other nations and with non-governmental\r\norganizations and representatives on solutions to the\r\nproblem of food security through approaches to\r\ntechnology transfer, financing and land reform.\r\nAs private trade and investment flows into\r\ndeveloping countries increasingly outweigh the\r\nsignificance of official development assistance, issues\r\nsuch as terms of trade and debt take on even greater\r\nsignificance. At the same time, new and complex issues\r\nare emerging which existing international structures are\r\nnot well placed to address.\r\nOne major emerging issue is the relationship\r\nbetween trade and labour standards. We are pleased to see\r\nthe International Labour Organization (ILO) focus on core\r\nlabour standards, including by working towards an\r\ninternational convention on the elimination of forced child\r\nlabour. There can be no clearer example of an issue\r\nwhere cooperation and dialogue with other international\r\nand regional organizations, particularly between the ILO\r\nand the World Trade Organization (WTO) and with non-\r\ngovernmental groups is required in order to produce\r\nsynergy rather than overlap.\r\nSustainable human security means providing for\r\nbasic needs not just in economic ways, but in political\r\nways as well. Recent conflicts have demonstrated by\r\nnegative example that respect for human rights and\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\ndemocratic principles is fundamental to the prevention of\r\nconflict.\r\nLast year, Canada commissioned work on the human\r\nrights components of the United Nations field operations.\r\nI am pleased to announce today that we will immediately\r\nbegin compiling a roster of qualified Canadian human rights\r\nexperts available for rapid deployment as part of larger\r\npeace-building operations. We look forward to coordinating\r\nour efforts with those of Norway and others to ensure\r\ncoherent, focused support for such United Nations efforts.\r\nIn 1998 we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This will be an\r\noccasion not only to reaffirm our commitment to its\r\nprinciples, but also to consider further practical steps to\r\nimplement them. One step we will take is to promote, as\r\npart of the fiftieth anniversary, the preparations led by the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, international\r\ndialogue on means to combat hate propaganda, which is so\r\noften the trigger of human tragedies such as genocide and\r\n“ethnic cleansing”.\r\nThe establishment of international war-crimes\r\nTribunals in The Hague for the former Yugoslavia and for\r\nRwanda represents a critical element of necessary progress\r\nin the field of human rights. They signal our determination\r\nto hold accountable all individuals guilty of committing\r\natrocities, be they officials of the State or extra- or para-\r\nState actors. Above all, they signal our determination to\r\nbreak the cycle of hatred. It is for these reasons that Canada\r\nstrongly urges the prompt establishment of a permanent\r\ninternational criminal court as a new instrument in the fight\r\nagainst massive human rights violations.\r\nThere is one aspect of human rights that my\r\nGovernment and I have personally decided to make an\r\nutmost priority: the rights of children. Let me take this\r\nopportunity to thank the Swedish Government and\r\ncommend the organizers of last month’s World Congress on\r\nthe Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. It is\r\nCanada’s fervent hope that this Congress will lead to the\r\nimplementation of the most effective practical measures, as\r\nwell as to the adoption and ratification of legally binding\r\ninternational instruments to combat child slavery and the\r\ncommercial sexual exploitation of children. We should\r\nmove resolutely to conclude negotiation of the Draft\r\nOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child\r\nPornography.\r\nWe will work through our own development funds\r\nwith all countries interested in similar goals.\r\nThe concept of sustainable democracy requires,\r\nbeyond a commitment to respect for basic human rights,\r\nalso a commitment to democratic development. In the last\r\ndecade we have seen the United Nations involved in the\r\npromotion of democracy from Cambodia to South Africa\r\nto Haiti. Other multilateral organizations are also playing\r\nan important role, such as the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the recent elections\r\nin Bosnia. Recent conflicts have demonstrated the\r\nimportance of stable democratic structures in promoting\r\nsustainable human security. They have also highlighted\r\nthe need to distinguish between legitimate aspirations and\r\ndangerous tendencies towards fragmentation. Attempts to\r\nstructure political participation around culturally or\r\nethnically “pure” mini-States must be resisted by the\r\ninternational community.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nHaiti has been a critical test for the United Nations.\r\nThe promotion of democratization has been an integral\r\npart of security. Concerted international effort is needed\r\nto support democracy, not merely for the sake of one\r\nleader or one election, but as part of the ongoing process\r\nof laying the foundations of democratic institutions. We\r\nmust recognize this and must make the commitments\r\nneeded to ensure that the United Nations can work\r\neffectively for peace and stability in Haiti.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nNigeria, Burundi and Burma are among the most\r\nrecent challenges to our collective ability to support\r\ndemocratic aspirations. Canada remains firmly committed\r\nto the restoration of democracy in these countries, and to\r\nworking in these countries and with our partners,\r\nbilaterally, multilaterally and within the Commonwealth\r\nand francophonie to this end.\r\nThe explosion of information technologies presents\r\ngreat dangers but also great opportunities for human\r\nsecurity. Extremist groups can spread their message of\r\nhate and intolerance more easily, and we have only to\r\nlook to Bosnia and Rwanda to see the tragic effects this\r\ncan have. Yet at the same time, these technologies have\r\nplaced powerful tools for the strengthening of civil\r\nsociety in the hands of millions of individual citizens and\r\ngroups.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nThe development of information technologies raises\r\nmany other questions, including issues of access and of\r\ncountering abuses such as the transmission of child\r\npornography or terrorism. The Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has mandated a study of these issues. In Canada\r\nwe believe we have solid knowledge and expertise in these\r\narea in terms of technology and jurisprudence and we will\r\nmake major contributions to finding solutions.\r\nI have outlined some of the major issues that require\r\nconceptual innovation on the part of the United Nations.\r\nThe counterpart to conceptual innovation is innovation in\r\nrenewing existing United Nations structures and developing\r\nnew ones. We should not hesitate to eliminate those\r\nprogrammes or bodies that no longer serve any useful\r\npurpose, to reorient those whose mission so requires, and\r\nto consolidate and eliminate duplication. Nor should we\r\nhesitate to create new instruments, within existing\r\nresources, to deal with the challenge of the day. Reform is\r\nmore than just cost-cutting, though that aspect must not be\r\nignored.\r\nOur first priority is the ongoing financial crisis the\r\nUnited Nations faces. We have seen some encouraging\r\nprogress in the establishment and early results of the\r\nEfficiency Board.\r\nPerhaps more importantly, there is a growing\r\nawareness of the need for financial and administrative\r\nrestructuring. But much remains to be done. I cannot\r\nsimply content myself here with calling yet again for all\r\nMembers to pay their dues unconditionally — in full and\r\non time. I have to ask why it is that over half the Member\r\nStates are failing to meet this standard, and some are failing\r\nto pay at all. Pressures on government budgets is no\r\nexcuse; Canada has in recent years undertaken some of the\r\nmost severe expenditure cuts of any developed country. Yet\r\nwe have maintained our commitment to pay our dues in full\r\nand on time, because we believe that the United Nations\r\nresponds to key international priorities.\r\nPerhaps some Members are withholding dues as a\r\nform of blackmail, hoping to pressure the United Nations\r\ninto reforms through fiscal starvation. This is both wrong-\r\nheaded and short-sighted. An organization in crisis will not\r\nhave the energy required to tackle genuine reform. What is\r\nneeded here is political will, both in paying dues and in\r\nmoving forward in the difficult task of reviewing the scale\r\nof assessments to better reflect the ability to pay. Canada\r\nhopes that others will join us in demonstrating that will\r\nduring the current session of the Assembly.\r\nAnother priority is to strengthen the effectiveness of\r\nthe Security Council by giving it greater accountability,\r\nrepresentativeness, transparency and responsibility.\r\nCanada attaches particular importance to the need to\r\nensure meaningful participation in decision-making by\r\nthose Members whose nationals — military or civilian —\r\nare in the crossfire of the conflicts that the Council is\r\ndebating.\r\nThe Council needs to address two issues: its role and\r\nits composition. On the former, if the Council is to come\r\nto terms with the more complex nature of international\r\npeace and security, it must be prepared to assume a\r\ngreater role in conflict prevention. This will require\r\ncooperation among the Security Council, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and other Governments and non-governmental\r\nactors in identifying and addressing emergency crises.\r\nOn the latter issue, the Council can address\r\ncriticisms of it as a closed body whose membership does\r\nnot fully reflect changes in the world since 1945 by\r\nincreasing the number of seats. The distribution of those\r\nseats should take into account in the first instance the\r\ncontribution of Members to the broader purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, and also the need for equitable\r\ngeographic representation. Membership has its privileges,\r\nbut more importantly, it must bring with it a special\r\nresponsibility and commitment to the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and to sustainable human security.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nEqually important is the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly. The United Nations General Assembly is the\r\none body that brings together all nations of the world in\r\ntheir full diversity. It represents on a global scale both the\r\nessence and the challenge of democracy. The General\r\nAssembly must achieve consensus and take decisions on\r\nthe new human security agenda. It must promote\r\nsustainable human security, a concept that combines the\r\nneed to husband natural resources, to generate growth and\r\nto ensure peace and security.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI have outlined today some of the steps that Canada\r\nhas taken to advance thinking, to improve existing\r\npractices and to develop new ones. And I know that other\r\nMember States have been working towards the very same\r\nend. We now have many options to consider and discuss.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nBut plans, proposals and studies are not enough. As\r\nthe poet Yeats said, “In dreams begins responsibility.” It is\r\neasy to dream; it is much harder to act. We have a renewed\r\nvision of multilateralism, and a renewed mandate not just\r\nfor the prevention of conflict, but for the nurturing of\r\npeace. We have started work on making that vision a\r\nreality. We all recognize how daunting this task is as we\r\nembark upon it; but we must persist, for the task is as vital\r\nas it is difficult.\r\nWe in 1996 must show ourselves capable of restoring\r\nthe spirit of 1956 when, in the deepest freeze of the cold-\r\nwar climate, the United Nations gave birth to peacekeeping\r\nand changed international relations forever. We need to find\r\nwithin ourselves the ability and the will to innovate and the\r\npersistence to implement our innovations. It is in the\r\ninterest of each one of us, as much as it is in the interests\r\nof all of us, to do so.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Egypt, His Excellency Mr. Amre\r\nMoussa.\r\nMr. Moussa (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThis session is being held amid a very sensitive and\r\ndelicate international situation which is generally\r\ncharacterized by political and socio-economic concerns.\r\nThis is particularly evident all over the developing world,\r\nwhich is overpopulated and simultaneously overburdened\r\nwith problems of backwardness and the challenges of\r\ndevelopment. The hopes that were raised with the end of\r\nthe cold war, heralding the advent of a new era in which\r\ncooperation and détente would prevail, soon were shattered\r\nin the midst of these problems and these concerns. We are\r\ncurrently facing conflicting phenomena, where elements of\r\ncomplementarity and integration coincide with tendencies\r\ntowards division and disunity. The technology and\r\ncommunications revolution runs parallel to the eruption of\r\nnational conflicts and ethnic animosities. Ambitions of\r\nleadership overlap practices of hegemony. This has created\r\na serious conceptual confusion which the international\r\norder, in its current form, cannot address in an effective or\r\ndeterring manner. Indeed, this order, due to its obvious\r\ndouble standards, might have contributed to the\r\nintensification of the era’s negative aspects at the expense\r\nof its positive aspects and gains.\r\nCertainly, the logic of evolution and the rules of\r\ntransformation indicate that the stages of change carry\r\nwithin them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry,\r\nunless an objective and conducive environment exists,\r\naccompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set of\r\nhighly advanced values that are crystallized through\r\ncoordinated and concerted efforts. This is precisely what\r\ndid not happen. The dichotomy between the North and the\r\nSouth is widening. The lack of common understanding\r\namong world cultures and civilizations is still present.\r\nThis has caused discord in world thinking and created\r\nmutual suspicions that not only pose an overwhelming\r\nthreat, jeopardizing the march of political progress and\r\nthe activities of economic development as well as the\r\nfabric of social development, but also have raised\r\nquestions as to whether the benefits of science and\r\ntechnology lead to world security and stability, or quite\r\nthe opposite.\r\nIn connection with contemporary international\r\npolitics, it is really most alarming that attempts are being\r\nmade to marginalize the United Nations at a time when\r\nthe world is in need of further understanding, better\r\ncoordination and accelerated interdependence. It would\r\nhave been more logical to call for the strengthening of\r\nthis Organization, so that it could perform its role in\r\nachieving these objectives in a truly democratic manner,\r\nwith the participation of all the countries of the world\r\nwith their diverse cultures, societies, sizes, orientations\r\nand achievements. This is particularly true since the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, in our view — a view shared by\r\nmany others — still represents a major instrument\r\ngoverning international life, and since any international\r\norder, be it old or new, must be based on a solid\r\nfoundation that respects rights, determines obligations and\r\nopens the door to an era of interaction among societies on\r\nthe basis of acceptance and understanding, not imposition\r\nor oppression.\r\nWe are definitely aware that the challenges of\r\ntomorrow are different from those of yesterday. We are\r\nalso aware that the United Nations, in its current culture,\r\nmay not be able, one way or another, to deal with future\r\nchallenges. However, this must be a subject for discussion\r\nto build consensus among us, not a matter to be\r\ndetermined by a few or to be decided unilaterally.\r\nFor these reasons, it is imperative to strive\r\ncollectively to build a common political will to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations, to enhance its effectiveness and to\r\nrestore its credibility in order to maintain world stability\r\nand security.\r\nThe annals of this Organization abound with\r\nhistorical achievements and it continues to make progress\r\nin dealing with the problems of our world. An in-depth\r\nreading of the Secretary-General’s reports on political,\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\neconomic and social situations in the world reassures us of\r\nthis role and we urge that it be upheld, because it addresses\r\nthe present and explores the prospects for the future\r\nthrough global understanding.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s role in developing a rational\r\nbasis for worldwide development activities has succeeded\r\nin focusing attention on the issues of our times through a\r\nseries of conferences held over the past five years on the\r\nenvironment, human rights, population, social development,\r\nwomen and human settlements. These represent important\r\nreference points for global action based on international\r\nconsensus in dealing with problems that were once marginal\r\nbut are today substantial. We call on the Secretary-General\r\nto pursue this approach, which allows the United Nations\r\nto stand out in a distinctive and positive way in a world of\r\ngrowing negativity.\r\nA strengthened role, reform and enhanced efficiency\r\nare our common objectives for the United Nations. The\r\nhistoric Declaration issued last year by the Heads of State\r\nand Government on the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations constitutes a cornerstone for the future work of the\r\nOrganization. The Declaration contained a clear conceptual\r\nframework for global action on the basis of the priorities\r\nupon which we all agreed: peace based on the principles\r\nand provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective\r\nregime of collective security; development in all its aspects\r\nin the social and economic fields; sovereign equality among\r\nStates and respect for peoples’ rights; and justice in\r\naddressing the various issues on the international agenda.\r\nEgypt deems it necessary to translate these noble principles\r\ninto clear programmes of action that take into consideration\r\nthe interests of all without discrimination.\r\nWhen we met here last year to celebrate the United\r\nNations fiftieth anniversary, we were dismayed by the\r\nevents in the Great Lakes region in Africa, where\r\nhorrendous massacres had left a painful humanitarian\r\nlegacy. We were disturbed by the events in Bosnia, where\r\nUnited Nations “safe areas” had been overrun and innocent\r\npeople had lost their lives in despicable ethnic strife.\r\nHowever, we were optimistic at that time about\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East. The Interim Agreement\r\nhad been signed between President Yasser Arafat and the\r\nlate Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, and described\r\nas an important step on the path to finding a solution to the\r\nquestion of Palestine. Has the situation changed or evolved\r\nfor the better?\r\nLet us look into last year’s developments in that\r\nregion. In recent months, the Middle East has undergone a\r\ncrisis that has almost stifled the peace process, a crisis\r\nresulting from the reluctance of the Israeli Government to\r\nact in keeping with the agreed fundamentals of peace.\r\nThis position has threatened a return to the language,\r\nconcepts, policies and even practices that were on the eve\r\nof extinction in the region. Thus, action on all peace\r\ntracks was deadlocked and the peace process stagnated.\r\nThis prompted Egypt, which initiated that process and\r\nbelieves in a just and balanced Arab-Israeli peace, to\r\nintensify efforts to rectify the situation and consolidate the\r\nfundamentals of this process, first among which is the\r\n“land for peace” principle.\r\nIn this context, I would like to put forward the Arab\r\nposition as contained in the final communiqué of the\r\nsummit held in Cairo last June. The attending Arab\r\nleaders unanimously expressed their keen interest in the\r\ncontinuation of the process of making a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace an Arab strategic option under\r\ninternational legality. This Arab position requires a\r\ncorresponding commitment, seriously and unequivocally\r\nundertaken by Israel, to abide by the principles agreed\r\nupon at the Madrid Conference, particularly the “land for\r\npeace” principle and the assurances provided to the\r\nparties. The Arab leaders stressed that any breach by\r\nIsrael of these principles or of the bases in which the\r\npeace process is anchored; any reneging on the\r\ncommitments, undertakings or agreements made in the\r\nframework of this process; or any procrastination in their\r\nimplementation would set back the peace process, with all\r\nthe risks and repercussions involved. This could replunge\r\nthe region into an atmosphere of tension and would force\r\nall Arab countries to reconsider the steps taken vis-à-vis\r\nIsrael within the framework of the peace process. In such\r\na case, the Israeli Government alone would assume full\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe Arab leaders emphasized that there would be no\r\nrecognition or acceptance of any situation resulting from\r\nIsraeli settlement activity in the occupied Arab territories,\r\nsince the settlements are considered an illegal measure\r\nthat entails no rights and establishes no obligations. The\r\nestablishment of settlements and the bringing in of settlers\r\nviolate international law and the Madrid framework and\r\nimpede the peace process, which requires Israel to halt all\r\nsettlement activities in the occupied territories. The Arab\r\nleaders also emphasized that a just and comprehensive\r\npeace in the Middle East can be achieved only through a\r\nresolution of the questions of Al-Quds and the Palestinian\r\nrefugees on the basis of their rights of return and to\r\ncompensation, in accordance with international legality\r\nand United Nations resolutions.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nA short while ago, the new Israeli Prime Minister met\r\nwith the Palestinian President. Undoubtedly, their meeting\r\nrepresents progress towards their mutual recognition as\r\npartners on an equal footing in the Palestinian-Israeli peace\r\nprocess. In theory, the peace process should proceed to\r\nimplement the commitments made under the Oslo Accords\r\nin accordance with the agreed timetable, but that has not\r\nyet happened.\r\nWe are interested not in handshakes or wide smiles for\r\nphoto opportunities, but rather in substantive developments.\r\nThus, what is required and what we should all strive for is\r\nthe implementation of commitments, serious negotiation and\r\ntime well spent. We call upon the entire world to follow up\r\nthe matter with us with full vigilance and to allow neither\r\nretrogression nor the manipulation of very sensitive and\r\nserious matters, namely, the establishment of a permanent\r\ncontractual peace between Palestine and Israel that fulfils\r\nthe national aspirations of the Palestinian people and\r\nculminates in their exercise of their right to self-\r\ndetermination under international supervision and the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State. This peace must also\r\nachieve security for Israel and all parties on an equal\r\nfooting.\r\nIsrael is called upon to desist from its settlement\r\npolicy, including the expansion of settlements, and to end\r\nits policies of closing territories and besieging the\r\nPalestinian people. It is called upon to honour its\r\ncommitments, redeploy its troops outside Hebron and\r\nresume without further delay the final status negotiations.\r\nIsrael is also called upon to put an end to its practices in\r\nAl-Quds, a city where any rights that could be claimed by\r\nIsrael are outweighed by Arab rights, which are more\r\nancient, legitimate and authentic than any Israeli claim to\r\nthe city.\r\nOn the Syrian track, I can say in all honesty and with\r\nfull confidence that Syria is ready to resume the\r\nnegotiations suspended last February at Israel’s request. The\r\nnegotiations should resume at the point at which they\r\nstopped, which is fair, and in accordance with the Madrid\r\nframework and the principle of “land for peace“, which is\r\nright.\r\nFrom this rostrum, Egypt calls for the resumption of\r\nthese negotiations. Israel must refrain from pursuing\r\npolicies and formulations that may be interpreted as\r\nsquandering years of negotiations and that constitute a\r\nregression from principles that have become an integral part\r\nof the rules for peaceful work in the region and are backed\r\nby international legality and supported by broad\r\ninternational consensus.\r\nOn the Lebanese track, we call for the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)\r\nand Israel’s full withdrawal from Lebanon, to which\r\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly stated they have no\r\nterritorial claim.\r\nPeace in the Middle East will not be comprehensive\r\nor lasting until a strict regime for regional security is\r\nestablished, based on arrangements that provide equal\r\nsecurity for all parties with minimum levels of armament.\r\nThe region must be totally free from all weapons of\r\nmass destruction — nuclear, chemical and biological —\r\nand their delivery systems. Peace and security cannot\r\nsurvive in the presence of any instability in the balance of\r\npower or serious discrepancy in the rights and obligations\r\nof the countries of the region.\r\nFurthermore, we are closely watching the huge\r\nIsraeli arsenal, which includes weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, missiles and anti-missile weapons. We\r\nwonder about the rationale behind it. We believe that it\r\nhas, indeed, led to a reaction by a number of countries in\r\nthe region to this serious escalation, at a time when we\r\nare all talking of peace. Given this fact — or, rather, to\r\navoid its consequences — Egypt proposes the initiation of\r\neffective negotiations to establish a zone free from all\r\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.\r\nPresident Hosni Mubarak has been making such a\r\nproposal since April 1990.\r\nEgypt calls upon the permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council and the depositary States of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\r\nwhich sponsored and adopted the resolution on the\r\nMiddle East during the Review and Extension Conference\r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, to take specific steps to establish a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in\r\naccordance with the Egyptian initiative, which has\r\nenjoyed the consensus of all the States concerned since\r\n1980.\r\nWhile Egypt stresses the fact that arms control and\r\nregional security constitute one of the pillars of peace and\r\nstability in the Middle East, it also believes that economic\r\nand regional cooperation under a just peace constitutes\r\nanother such pillar. Regional cooperation is inseparable\r\nfrom the establishment of peace: peace is its essence and\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nits framework. Two sessions of the Middle East-North\r\nAfrica Economic Summit have been held, in Casablanca\r\nand in Amman, the capital of Jordan. Both were held in an\r\natmosphere of optimism that the peace process would\r\nsucceed. Indeed, there have been some successes, such as\r\nthe signing of the interim agreement between Israel and\r\nPalestine, and the holding of direct negotiations between\r\nSyria and Israel. They took place against the background of\r\na receding settlement policy and continuous discussion\r\nabout peace and its objectives. However, today we see the\r\nexact opposite. This state of affairs threatens peace, its\r\nframework and all that is associated with it, including\r\nregional cooperation, which can prosper only in an\r\natmosphere of peace and hope for the future. We therefore\r\ncall upon Israel to return to the fundamental framework of\r\npeace in accordance with the agreements concluded, the\r\nterms of reference established and the principles approved.\r\nWhile Egypt is in favour of holding the third\r\nEconomic Summit as scheduled — like others, we have a\r\ngreat deal to contribute in the fields of economic reform,\r\ninvestment and development — we call upon the sponsors\r\nof the peace process, especially the United States, to strive\r\nto create the conditions that could lead to the successful\r\nconvening of the Summit. That can be achieved only by\r\nmaking serious endeavours on all peace tracks, in terms of\r\nboth negotiation and implementation. We are making this\r\ndeclaration before the entire international community, so\r\nthat every party will discharge its responsibilities and\r\nhonour its commitments. If they do not, the balance will be\r\ndisturbed and the issue will become meaningless.\r\nPeace in the Middle East is contingent upon justice,\r\nbalance and honesty in negotiating and addressing the needs\r\nof peoples. From this stems the open Egyptian diplomacy\r\nthat regards the current situation as a matter of utmost\r\nseriousness. We once again reiterate that Egypt rejects any\r\nmeasure that results in an unbalanced peace that satisfies\r\nthe interests of one party at the expense of another. The\r\npeace that we aspire to is a balanced Arab-Israeli peace that\r\nreciprocates right for right, security for security, and\r\ncommitment for commitment.\r\nA just and comprehensive peace is the cornerstone of\r\nstability in the Middle East. Despite the unpropitious\r\nattitude of the new Israeli Government to the peace process,\r\nright alone will eventually prevail. Peace will impose itself,\r\npropelled by the desire of the peoples of the region,\r\nincluding the people of Israel, to live in genuine peace,\r\ncooperation and stability.\r\nEgypt, whose people contributed to laying the\r\nfoundations of human civilization, has for centuries\r\naccepted and continues to accept the imperatives of\r\ngeography and history, which give Egypt special\r\nresponsibilities for the affairs of our region and beyond.\r\nEgypt takes the initiative for peace, seeks prosperity,\r\nprompts enlightenment and is steadfastly involved in\r\nadvancing the march of progress.\r\nEgypt therefore empathizes with the agony of the\r\nregion and the repercussions of developments there.\r\nWhile peace in the Middle East is at a crucial stage, the\r\nGulf region, which is part of the Middle East, is also\r\nundergoing a number of unfavourable developments. The\r\nstability of the Gulf region is, for more than one reason,\r\nlinked to the ultimate interests of Egypt and its security.\r\nIn particular, it is an area endowed with a potential and\r\nwith characteristics that make its stability and security a\r\nmatter of significance to all Powers concerned with\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe result of our review of the succession of events\r\nin this area leads us to several conclusions. First, strict\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions on Iraq,\r\nwithout fail or divergences, is the only way to guarantee\r\nthe end of the crisis that erupted in August 1990.\r\nSecondly, the use of force cannot restore rights or rectify\r\nwrongs. Thus, the rights of the Iraqi people, the\r\nmaintenance of its unity and respect for the rights and\r\nwell-being of Iraqis, whether Arabs or Kurds, will remain\r\nthe major concern of all of us. We are equally concerned\r\nwith safeguarding the rights of the people of Kuwait and\r\nthe return of detainees and property.\r\nThirdly, the memorandum of understanding on the\r\noil-for-food resolution, which was reached after arduous\r\nnegotiations, must be put into effect without any further\r\ndelay to alleviate the suffering of our brothers, the Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nFourthly, compromising territorial integrity and the\r\nunity of Iraq is not only a breach of international law but\r\nwill open the door to major repercussions undermining\r\nregional stability and threatening the interests of\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nFifthly, the withdrawal of Iran from the three islands\r\nof the United Arab Emirates — Abu Musa, Tunb as\r\nSughra and Tunb al Kubra — is a sine qua non condition\r\nfor defusing another hotbed of tension. The Arab call to\r\nIran to settle amicably any territorial claims to those\r\nislands is still valid.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nSixthly, the policy of intervention and the attempts to\r\nmanipulate ethnic and religious minorities to destabilize\r\nother neighbouring countries cannot help to establish\r\nstability in the Gulf region or the wider region of the\r\nMiddle East, or help ensure the interests of any of the\r\nparties concerned, in addition to its being a flagrant\r\nviolation of the rules of international conduct.\r\nBefore leaving the issue of the Middle East, I would\r\nlike to refer to the dispute between Libya and some\r\nWestern countries, a dispute to which we attach particular\r\nimportance because of its repercussions for the region as\r\nwell as the damage and suffering it inflicts on our brothers,\r\nthe people of Libya, on the economies of the neighbouring\r\ncountries and on the stability of the region in general. In\r\nview of our keen interest in averting an escalation of the\r\nproblem and in expediting the attainment of an early\r\nsettlement, we support the efforts and initiatives made by\r\nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement, and call for\r\na positive response to those efforts and initiatives.\r\nMoving from the Middle East to Africa, we find\r\nstories of success and of failure — pictures both bleak and\r\nbright. While our sister country Rwanda has restored its\r\nstability and launched its reconstruction and development,\r\nits neighbour, our sister Burundi, is an example of the real\r\nturmoil which is affecting the entire Great Lakes region.\r\nLast year we expressed our extreme dismay at the situation\r\nin this important region; today we reiterate this, and stress\r\nthe need for the Security Council to discharge its\r\nresponsibilities to avert the recurrence of Rwanda’s tragedy\r\nin Burundi.\r\nThere is, however, a positive element that we hope\r\nwill not be lost in the disappointment over the deteriorating\r\nsituation in Africa: the efforts of the OAU, which have\r\nstarted to take shape within an institutional framework that\r\nwe hope will be successful. This was embodied in the\r\nestablishment of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution, which will play a role in\r\nresolving the problems of the continent. The countries and\r\nthe leaders of the Great Lakes region, particularly former\r\nPresident Nyerere, have played a laudable collective role in\r\nreconciliation, dealing with the question of refugees and the\r\nrampant ethnic rivalries in the region. Serious efforts were\r\nalso made by the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) to settle the Liberian problem,\r\nparticularly by Nigeria, which has made continuing efforts\r\nduring its current chairmanship of that subregional group.\r\nWe commend the efforts made by Ghana during its\r\nchairmanship of ECOWAS over the past two years. We call\r\non the international community, and the United Nations\r\nin particular, to support all of these efforts and to provide\r\nthe necessary means for their success.\r\nThis applies also to the numerous efforts made to\r\nachieve national reconciliation in Somalia, the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol in Angola and the\r\nsettlement plan in Western Sahara. We hope that the\r\nparties concerned will benefit from these historic\r\nopportunities, so that stability will prevail in Africa and\r\nso that international support for these efforts will\r\ncontinue, particularly in terms of post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation and socio-economic reconstruction.\r\nIn this context, I should like to draw attention to the\r\ngravity of the continued deterioration of the socio-\r\neconomic situation in the African continent, which\r\nincludes two-thirds of the world’s least-developed\r\ncountries; one-third of its population is facing starvation.\r\nDespite this fact, the countries of the continent are\r\ntenaciously striving towards economic reform, structural\r\nadjustment, strengthening regional cooperation among\r\nthemselves and dealing with the social situation in the\r\ncontinent in accordance with the Declaration issued in\r\nCairo in March 1995.\r\nThese efforts are still faltering as a result of\r\ndiminishing international support and a lack of necessary\r\nfinancial resources. Thus we support the United Nations\r\nSystem-Wide Special Initiative for Africa presented last\r\nMarch by the Secretary-General based upon\r\ncomprehensive mobilization of resources and full\r\nparticipation of international institutions. Hence, we call\r\nupon donor countries and upon the international\r\ncommunity to take the necessary measures to deal with\r\nthe critical economic situation in Africa, particularly the\r\nexternal debt problem, by providing the necessary\r\nresources and creating an environment that will enable the\r\ncontinent to join the march of development and to be able\r\nto address its socio-economic problems, which represent\r\none of the root causes of political tension and instability\r\nthere.\r\nThe critical economic situation in Africa leads us to\r\nvoice some of the concerns of Egypt and the developing\r\ncountries vis-à-vis the world’s economy. Suffice it here to\r\nmake a reference to the importance of the faithful\r\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements and the\r\nnecessity to address the negative impact on the net food\r\nimporting countries. We look forward to the success of\r\nthe first ministerial conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), to be held in Singapore. We would\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nlike to highlight the importance of focusing on the\r\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements without\r\nattempting to raise new issues such as those pertaining to\r\ninvestment and the linkage between international trade, on\r\nthe one hand, and labour and environment, on the other.\r\nAny proposed additional issues should be subject to in-\r\ndepth study. We reiterate the leading and important role of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) in this regard prior to bringing such issues to\r\nthe WTO for consideration.\r\nTurning to Bosnia, there is hope of implementing the\r\nDayton agreement to put an end to the appalling tragedy\r\ncaused by “ethnic cleansing” and racist narrow-mindedness.\r\nThe agreement will be implemented under international\r\nprotection, represented by the Implementation Force\r\n(IFOR), to which Egypt and numerous other countries\r\ncontribute. Despite all the circumstances associated with the\r\nelection process, its results are still a source of optimism in\r\nthe possible victory of the forces of moderation so that\r\nBosnia can become a multi-ethnic State where Serbs,\r\nMuslims and Croats live together in peace.\r\nEgypt welcomes the election of President Izetbejovic\r\nas President of the tripartite Presidential Council. In this\r\nrespect we would like to stress a number of points which\r\nwe think can guarantee the stability of the situation and\r\nensure full compliance with the provisions of the Dayton\r\nagreement. First, it is important to consolidate the territorial\r\nintegrity of Bosnia, to reject vehemently and strictly any\r\nattempts at partition and to respect the democratic process\r\nand the results of elections. Secondly, it is necessary to\r\nassist the State of Bosnia in completing the necessary\r\ncomponents of building its national army and to provide it\r\nwith the equipment it needs to deter any external threat or\r\nface a new collapse of the internal situation after IFOR\r\nwithdraws. Thirdly, it is necessary to provide the economic\r\nsupport Bosnia needs to rebuild and rehabilitate the country,\r\nsince this will represent support for the foundations of\r\ncoexistence and peace among its three ethnic groups.\r\nFourthly, it is essential to punish the war criminals.\r\nOtherwise, talking about human rights in the world will be\r\nfutile and will be considered as an entrenchment of double\r\nstandards.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism has become exacerbated\r\nand now knows no boundaries. We must all implement the\r\nDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate International\r\nTerrorism, which was adopted at the forty-ninth session.\r\nTerrorists must find no refuge in any civilized country. We\r\nmust all cooperate in uprooting all sources of terrorism. We\r\nmust construct a well-defined legal system that ensures the\r\npursuit of those who are responsible for terrorism, and\r\ntheir prosecution and extradition to stand trial for the\r\ncrimes they have perpetrated, crimes that terrorize\r\npeaceful people and threaten international stability. We\r\nmust define clear criteria and rules that guarantee that the\r\nright of political asylum will not be extended to the\r\nundeserving, so that that right will not become a licence\r\nencouraging terrorists and protecting them from\r\nprosecution and punishment.\r\nTerrorism is an international phenomenon that is not\r\nlinked to a particular geographic region or to a particular\r\ncivilization, culture or religion. We have witnessed the\r\nevidence, ranging from the Far East to the Middle East,\r\nto Europe, and to America. Terrorism has even come\r\nclose to this very building. The entire international\r\ncommunity must harness the necessary resources to\r\nconfront this vicious aggressive phenomenon, to eradicate\r\nits sources and to isolate whoever provides it with\r\nassistance and encouragement. In this respect, I call on\r\nthe United Nations and the civilized peoples of the world\r\nto respond swiftly to the call of President Hosni Mubarak\r\nto hold an international conference to deal with the\r\ncriminal phenomenon of terrorism and, as a contribution\r\nto peace and stability in the world at large — to mobilize\r\njoint international efforts to combat it.\r\nI began my statement with our perception of the role\r\nof this Organization. I conclude it by paying tribute and\r\nexpressing my appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, whose expertise and insight have\r\ncontributed, during his current tenure, to the identification\r\nof problems and challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity and this Organization. He has drawn up the\r\nagenda on items under consideration as well as\r\napproaches for dealing with them. The implementation of\r\nthis agenda is contingent upon the will and the interest of\r\nthe Member States.\r\nAs it reiterates its confidence in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, a confidence shared by members of two of the\r\nmost prominent regional organizations — the Arab\r\nLeague and the Organization of African Unity — Egypt\r\nattaches high priority to seeing him preside over the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat for a second term, during\r\nwhich he will have the chance to lead the Secretariat and\r\nto take part in implementing the programmes he devised,\r\nthe reform process he designed and the solutions he\r\ninitiated to the problems facing the Organization,\r\nproblems that surface in an international arena witnessing\r\nthe birth of a new order whose features are not yet\r\ndefined, problems that occur as the United Nations passes\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nthrough a historic juncture, on the threshold of a new\r\ncentury and a new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs and Worship of Costa Rica, Mr. Fernando\r\nNaranjo Villalobos.\r\nMr. Naranjo Villalobos (Costa Rica) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The delegation of Costa Rica is pleased to\r\nextend its warmest congratulations to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on his election. In addition to his\r\ndistinguished personal and professional qualities, we are\r\ninspired by the respect and friendship that we share with\r\nMalaysia, a living example of many peoples joining their\r\nefforts without losing their identity, as is appropriately\r\nstated in the motto of Malaysia: Unity is strength.\r\nI am also pleased to convey Costa Rica’s respects to\r\nthe former President of the General Assembly, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his excellent\r\nwork presiding over the deliberations of the Assembly.\r\nMr. Secretary-General, your work in favour of world\r\npeace and security and your efforts to renew the United\r\nNations have granted you a place of honour in the pages of\r\nthe history of this Organization and of the international\r\ncommunity. My delegation wishes to convey the gratitude\r\nand respect Costa Rica feels for your commendable work.\r\nA session of the General Assembly is necessarily a\r\ntime for meditation for all Member States. Each and every\r\ndelegation asks itself the same questions: what progress has\r\nbeen made towards fulfilling the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations during the last 12 months? What has our\r\ncountry or region done to contribute to that task? Is the\r\nUnited Nations playing the role we would like it to? What\r\ncan we do to ensure that this Organization lives up to the\r\nhopes placed in it? What progress have we achieved in the\r\nreform of the United Nations?\r\nWe are keenly aware that in this post-cold-war era the\r\nUnited Nations agenda has grown considerably.\r\nNevertheless, the present situation does not seem very\r\nencouraging. The establishment of this Organization, as we\r\nwere reminded during the celebration of its fiftieth\r\nanniversary, was one of the most extraordinary\r\nconsequences of the end of the Second World War.\r\nHowever, the so-called balance of terror between the super-\r\nPowers that prevailed in the cold-war years has been\r\nfollowed by a long series of conflicts that, despite their\r\nlimited geographical scope, are nonetheless damaging and\r\nbloody. We have watched in anguish as, in several parts of\r\nthe world, national, religious, tribal and racial hatreds\r\nhave re-emerged. Even within pluralistic democracies,\r\nsituations of extreme poverty and social injustice in some\r\ninstances, or of crime and drug trafficking in others, have\r\nunleashed varying degrees of violence. To all this we\r\nmust add the recent events of recent weeks in the Middle\r\nEast, which have given rise to deep concern and may\r\nhave grave consequences for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nNonetheless, there are grounds for optimism. We\r\nhope that the elections in Bosnia, which took place in a\r\nharmonious environment, will allow for the establishment\r\nof a durable multi-ethnic State, in the spirit of the peace\r\nagreements.\r\nIn the same vein, my delegation welcomes the\r\nresumption of negotiations between the State of Israel and\r\nthe Palestinian Authority aimed at achieving harmonious\r\nrelations among the peoples inhabiting the Holy Land. I\r\nam pleased to inform the General Assembly that a\r\nplenipotentiary envoy from Costa Rica met recently with\r\nChairman Arafat to convey to him Costa Rica’s solidarity\r\nwith the Palestinian people and its steadfast determination\r\nto support and contribute to compliance with the Oslo\r\nagreements in order to achieve a stable and lasting peace\r\nin the Middle East.\r\nCosta Rica, which will soon celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the abolition of its armed forces, also\r\nwelcomed the Advisory Opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice regarding the legality of the use and\r\nthreat of use of nuclear weapons, and it is deeply satisfied\r\nby the opening for signature of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Since 1958, in the framework\r\nof the Organization of American States, my country has\r\nbeen proposing the limitation of conventional weapons\r\nand the prohibition of nuclear weapons within the inter-\r\nAmerican system. In keeping with this civil and pacifist\r\ninclination, Costa Rica signed the Treaty at the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation further calls fraternally upon all\r\nMember States of the United Nations to do likewise as\r\nsoon as possible. Similarly, my nation considers most\r\nfavourably the draft resolution proposed by Malaysia\r\nregarding the follow-up to the Advisory Opinion and its\r\ncall for the start of negotiations to conclude a treaty\r\nproviding for global nuclear disarmament.\r\nWe are also of the view that greater consideration\r\nneeds to be given to the problems raised by international\r\narms transfers and trade. The delegation of Costa Rica\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to recall the draft\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\ninternational code of conduct on this issue, proposed by the\r\nformer President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias, and other\r\nNobel Prize laureates, in accordance with the principles of\r\nthe United Nations and with the aspiration of maintaining\r\nworld peace.\r\nCosta Rica is also pleased to say that Central America\r\nhas continued its progress in consolidating peace and\r\ndemocracy. Although we still suffer serious problems and\r\nstill face harsh social and economic realities, the bloody\r\ncrisis of the 1980s belongs to the past. The Central\r\nAmerican countries are firmly committed to consolidating\r\npeace and maintaining democracy. Honest and pluralistic\r\nelectoral processes have become the norm where before\r\nthey were the exception. National reconciliation is\r\nbecoming a reality. The recent, definitive progress in the\r\nGuatemalan peace process augurs well for the definitive\r\nattainment of peace in the entire Central American area. In\r\nthis regard, I am pleased to extend special congratulations\r\nto the Government of President Alvaro Arzú Irigoyen, to\r\nthe Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG),\r\nto the Group of Friends, particularly the Government of\r\nMexico and President Ernesto Zedillo, and to the Secretariat\r\nof the United Nations, for the progress recently achieved.\r\nThe existence of peace and democracy in Central\r\nAmerica, a region usually considered turbulent, proves that\r\nwill and perseverance can overcome any of the negative\r\nlegacies of history. We, the Central American peoples, hope\r\nthat other peoples will join in this experience, without\r\nhaving to pay so high a price. Nonetheless, precisely\r\nbecause all the countries in the region were affected, in one\r\nway or another, by this political and security crisis, all of\r\nus are now working determinedly to ensure that that chapter\r\nwill not be reopened.\r\nWe know, furthermore, that without development there\r\nwill be no lasting peace. With this conviction, the Central\r\nAmerican region has found a common goal in the\r\nendeavour to attain sustainable political, economic, social\r\ncultural and environmental development.\r\nTwo years ago, the Central American nations decided\r\nto unite in an Alliance for Sustainable Development. In\r\naddition to reconciling humankind with nature, this Alliance\r\naspires to establish in our countries a society that will allow\r\npresent generations to fully develop their capabilities in all\r\nareas and that will ensure future generations a prosperous\r\nfuture.\r\nOur Alliance is based on a common political project\r\nthat combines economic growth, environmental balance and\r\nindividual freedom. For the first time in its long history,\r\nCentral America has a common developmental goal, and\r\nthis in turn strengthens its dedication to regionalism.\r\nIn the same line of action, Central America has set\r\nout on a quest for innovative approaches to the rest of the\r\nworld that will help it realize its political, social,\r\neconomic, cultural and environmental goals. This joint\r\nfraternal action aimed at reincorporating Central America\r\ninto the international community has sought to\r\ninstitutionalize new links with other countries and regions\r\nthat have supported our efforts to attain peace and\r\ndemocracy in the isthmus, and that are now cooperating\r\nin our struggle for sustainable development. Central\r\nAmerica has thus established special mechanisms of\r\ndialogue and cooperation with Mexico, Chile, Canada, the\r\nUnited States of America, Japan, the Republic of Korea\r\nand the Republic of China on Taiwan. We have also\r\nredefined our relations with the European Union,\r\ninstitutionalized since the start of the last decade in what\r\nis known as the San José dialogue. We hope that in the\r\nnear future these activities will be extended to other\r\ncountries and regions.\r\nThe conviction that it is possible to consolidate\r\npeace only through development is not exclusive to\r\nCentral America. This year my country has had the\r\nhonour and the privilege to preside over the Group of 77\r\nand China in New York. This has allowed us to represent\r\nand defend on numerous occasions the points of view of\r\nthe countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nOne fifth of humanity continues to live in conditions\r\nof extreme poverty; discrimination on the basis of gender\r\ncontinues to be the order of the day; millions of children\r\ncontinue to lack access to education, health services and\r\nnutrition. My delegation views these facts with deep\r\nregret and attaches the utmost importance to the Agenda\r\nfor Development.\r\nIn this connection, I wish to reiterate the conviction\r\nexpressed recently on the occasion of the adoption of the\r\nreport of the Working Group on this matter — that that\r\nforum must remain open. A true United Nations system\r\nis inconceivable without an integrated and comprehensive\r\nplan of action for development. If the issues of\r\ndevelopment and international cooperation were to be\r\nreduced or diminished in this Organization, the very\r\nessence of the United Nations would be seriously\r\naffected.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nIn that same spirit of solidarity that holds sway in our\r\nOrganization, we believe that the preservation and\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations\r\nInternational Development Organization (UNIDO) are\r\nessential. For small countries in particular, the linkage\r\nbetween commerce, technology transfer and development\r\nare, in and of themselves, outside the framework of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization. In order to emphasize this firm\r\nconviction, the President of Costa Rica travelled to South\r\nAfrica on the occasion of UNCTAD’s 9th meeting. At that\r\nforum he expressed our country’s support for the just and\r\nlegitimate aspirations to development of the countries of the\r\nthird world.\r\nInternational cooperation cannot be viewed solely in\r\nterms of the richest giving aid to the poorest. We strongly\r\nbelieve in the necessity and appropriateness of intensifying\r\nthe efforts aimed at increasing horizontal cooperation\r\nbetween developing countries. In January 1997, at the\r\nconclusion of its term as Chairman of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, Costa Rica will convene — with the participation of\r\nthe private sector and non-governmental organizations — a\r\nSouth-South conference on trade, finance and investment.\r\nWe hope that new and constructive approaches to speed up\r\nthe rate of economic and financial cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries will result from that conference.\r\nDirectly related to the subject of the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment is the need for an integrated follow-up to the\r\nagreements and programmes of action adopted at the\r\nsummits and conferences held by the United Nations in the\r\nlast decade. In them lies the real agenda of work for the\r\nUnited Nations in such essential fields as the environment,\r\npopulation, human rights, the rights of women and children,\r\nhabitat and social development. Accordingly, Costa Rica, in\r\nits capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77 and China,\r\npromoted and received unanimous support in the Economic\r\nand Social Council for a resolution designed to give\r\ncoherence and provide follow-up to the agreements and\r\nprogrammes of action of the international conferences and\r\nsummits of the United Nations.\r\nCosta Rica, as an agricultural country, attaches great\r\nimportance to the food summit planned to be held at Rome\r\nat the end of this year. As early as 1954, through the\r\ninitiative of then-President José Figueres Ferrer, Costa Rica\r\nproposed to this Organization the creation of a world food\r\nreserve that would enable us to confront the effects of\r\nnatural disasters and famines. Today we still believe that\r\ninternational solidarity is decisive in facing food challenges\r\nand that it constitutes a fundamental goal of contemporary\r\ninternational relations that should not be disregarded in\r\nthe search for economic liberalization.\r\nOf greatest importance, and closely related to these\r\nissues, is the need to pay attention to the problems of\r\ndesertification and water resources, which during the early\r\nyears of the next millennium will gravely affect food\r\nproduction and the very existence of the human species.\r\nAt the World Summit for Social Development, it\r\nwas reaffirmed that human rights are universal,\r\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. Among those\r\nrights is the global right to development, which, in Costa\r\nRica’s opinion, right cannot be reduced to its mere\r\neconomic dimension. Development must also have a\r\nmoral and ethical dimension. We must accept the\r\nresponsibility of ensuring that the world that we are going\r\nto leave to future generations is going to be more\r\npeaceful, healthier, more humane and more democratic\r\nthan the one in which we have lived. This responsibility\r\nmust be shared individually and collectively, nationally\r\nand internationally by all elements of society.\r\nReflection on what we have done and what we have\r\nfailed to do over the last 12 months leads us to the\r\nquestion of what must be done in the immediate future.\r\nIn this connection, the revitalization and reform of the\r\nUnited Nations system is pivotal. In its analysis of this\r\nissue, the Government of Costa Rica has considered with\r\ndeep interest some of the proposals contained in the\r\nreport of the Commission on Global Governance. The\r\nreform of the United Nations must reflect the realities of\r\nchange, including the capacity of civil society to\r\ncontribute to global governance.\r\nMy delegation attaches fundamental importance to\r\nthe restructuring of the Security Council. We cannot\r\narrive at the year 2000 still using the calendar of 1945.\r\nThe Council cannot continue to be held in a framework\r\nthat has been fully overtaken by the reality of\r\ninternational politics. Costa Rica considers it a priority to\r\ntake up this task, both in order to grant permanent\r\nmembership to Germany and Japan and to a\r\nrepresentative of each of the three developing regions —\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In\r\naddition, we must reorganize the powers of the Council\r\nand of its members. If the political conditions for a\r\nreform of this kind do not exist, we must then consider\r\nother possibilities, such as the proposal made by the\r\nGovernment of Italy.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nWe consider that there is a need to infuse the General\r\nAssembly with new vitality, as regards both the need to\r\nensure the principle of universality and the modernization\r\nof its agenda and procedures. We believe that no people on\r\nEarth should be denied the right to be represented in our\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation is also of the view that greater\r\nimportance should be given to the work of the Council and\r\nthe Secretariat in the area of preventive diplomacy. The\r\nactions of these bodies at the outset of a conflict can be\r\ndecisive in achieving a solution, but they would be even\r\nmore so if their powers were increased so that they could\r\nanticipate such situations. Similarly, we believe that there\r\nis a need to restructure the Secretariat to give it greater\r\nflexibility and effectiveness in the execution of its tasks.\r\nAs a country that entrusts its security to international\r\nlaw, Costa Rica gives a place of honour to the International\r\nCourt of Justice. In our opinion, the acceptance of the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court could become a duty\r\ninherent in membership of this Organization.\r\nFinally, the restructuring of the United Nations is also\r\ndirectly linked to its financial capabilities. The new United\r\nNations cannot be the property of the major Powers, nor\r\ncan it become the sole responsibility of a small group of\r\nStates. The United Nations of the future should belong to\r\nall, and this conception logically involves the duty of all its\r\nMembers to meet their commitments in accordance with the\r\nscale of assessments. In this respect, my delegation believes\r\nthat the full reform of the United Nations system, if it\r\nensures a more rational administration and more equitable\r\ndistribution of the resources and programmes of the\r\nOrganization, will put the Organization in a better position\r\nto insist that its Members States pay their assessments on\r\ntime.\r\nOur world is approaching the third millennium. In the\r\nmidst of so much darkness, so many challenges and so\r\nmany overwhelming difficulties, the human race retains a\r\nspirit that, together with the use of language, distinguishes\r\nit from any other species: hope. This spirit, now more than\r\never before, is embodied in this Organization. The United\r\nNations must remain united in its effort to make the present\r\nbetter and united in its goal to design a promising future.\r\nI should like to conclude by recalling a teaching of the\r\nProphet Mohammed which continues to resonate today as\r\na norm of conduct for all human beings and all nations on\r\nEarth:\r\n“Do not break the ties of friendship, do not feel\r\nbitterness towards your fellow men, do not feel\r\nloathing for them, do not envy them. Live as\r\nbrothers, as God has ordered us to do.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mihai Popov.\r\nMr. Popov (Republic of Moldova) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr.\r\nRazali most warmly on his election as President of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\r\nI am convinced that his diplomatic qualities will\r\ncontribute greatly to the attainment of the objectives of\r\nthis session. It is my pleasure to express my gratitude to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral for the\r\nexcellent conduct and competence that he displayed\r\nduring his presidency of the previous session.\r\nDuring the five years that have elapsed since the\r\ndeclaration of our independence, and in the four years\r\nsince the Republic of Moldova was admitted to the\r\nUnited Nations, we have tried to show the whole world\r\nthat we are a country that is seeking a worthy place in the\r\ninternational community. My country’s choice of the rule\r\nof law and a market economy has led to an increase in its\r\ncredibility at the international level. I should like to assure\r\nthe Assembly that the Republic of Moldova is irreversibly\r\ncommitted to the path of democracy, which is the best\r\nguarantee of sustainable development, peace and social\r\nprogress. I should like to stress that the process of\r\ndemocratic reforms in our country has been, and\r\ncontinues to be, supported by the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies, by the European organizations and\r\nby the entire international community. I take this\r\nopportunity to extend thanks for this assistance, which is\r\nessential for our programme of reforms.\r\nThe complex process of transition in the Republic of\r\nMoldova and in the countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope is facing difficulties that require additional means.\r\nThis reform has also created negative social phenomena,\r\nwhich have particularly affected the most vulnerable\r\ngroups of the population. To alleviate these undesirable\r\neffects, the Government has adopted and implemented\r\nmeasures of social protection. The difficulties that we are\r\nfacing in promoting economic reforms are created not\r\nonly by a lack of experience but also by a shortage of\r\ncommodities and financial and energy resources. In this\r\nrespect, I should like to stress the importance of support\r\nand encouragement offered to the Republic of Moldova\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nby the international financial institutions, by the United\r\nNations specialized agencies and by certain developed\r\ncountries. We will also need such support in the future to\r\nsmoothly carry out our reforms.\r\nIntegration into European economic and political\r\nstructures remains a priority of our foreign policy. We are\r\nconvinced that, given the objectives of economic and social\r\nreform, the development and deepening of relations with\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Council of Europe and the European Union, as\r\nwell as close cooperation in the context of the Partnership\r\nfor Peace programme and the North Atlantic Cooperation\r\nCouncil, take on a new dimension. Such a process also\r\ncreates favourable conditions for the affirmation of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova as a sovereign and independent State.\r\nWe state our willingness to cooperate with regional\r\norganizations to ensure stability in Europe as well as peace\r\nand security throughout the world. The choice of permanent\r\nneutrality stipulated in our Constitution explains why the\r\nRepublic of Moldova is not participating in, and does not\r\nintend to join, the military structures of the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States or of other regional organizations.\r\nThe conflict in the eastern part of my country remains\r\nan obstacle to democratization and to progress on economic\r\nreforms. We cannot ignore the continuing violations of\r\nhuman rights in the Transdnestr. The international\r\ncommunity has been informed of them many times. Despite\r\nour negotiations and many appeals of international\r\norganizations, we have yet to obtain the release of the\r\nmembers of the Ilascu group, who were sentenced and\r\nimprisoned illegally four years ago by the anti-constitutional\r\nauthorities of Tiraspol.We are concerned that the Moldavian\r\npopulation in the schools and institutions of this region of\r\nthe country are banned from using Latin characters in the\r\nstudy of their mother tongue.\r\nThis conflict still remains a central concern, despite\r\nnegotiations, despite the spirit of compromise of the\r\npolitical leaders, and despite their will to resolve the\r\nproblems in the eastern zone through peaceful means, in\r\ncooperation with international organizations such as the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, and together with the\r\nassistance of the affected States, Russia and the Ukraine,\r\nwhich have expressed their willingness to be guarantors.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova believes that the only\r\nsolution to the conflict lies in the development of a draft\r\nlaw related to the special status of Transdnestr as an\r\nintegral part of a unified and indivisible State, in\r\naccordance with our Constitution. In the context of\r\nnegotiations, we have already signed several interim\r\ndocuments covering various aspects of the normalization\r\nof the situation in this region. We remain true to the\r\nprinciple of territorial integrity and of the sovereignty of\r\nthe State, which we will always respect. Unfortunately,\r\nthe authorities of the anti-constitutional republic are not\r\nyet ready to accept the principle of territorial integrity and\r\nof the sovereignty of the State.\r\nWe reaffirm our willingness to continue negotiations\r\nwith the authorities of Tiraspol in order to find a solution\r\nto the Transdnestr conflict.\r\nWe consider that the process of a peaceful and\r\ndefinitive solution to the conflict in the eastern zone of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova could be considerably\r\naccelerated through the immediate, complete, ordered and\r\nunconditional withdrawal of military units of the Russian\r\nFederation.\r\nWe are concerned by the fact that these foreign\r\ntroops continue to be stationed on the territory of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, which is contrary to our\r\nconstitutional stipulation of the neutrality of our country.\r\nAlthough the agreement between the Republic of\r\nMoldova and the Russian Federation relating to the legal\r\nstatus, the method and the terms of withdrawal of Russian\r\nmilitary contingents stationed temporarily on the territory\r\nof Moldova was signed two years ago, the Russian State\r\nDuma has yet to ratify the agreement. We hope that the\r\ncompetent Russian authorities will accelerate the entry\r\ninto force and the implementation of the Moldovan-\r\nRussian agreement of 21 October 1994.\r\nAs regards to the revitalization of the United Nations\r\nand the reform of its structures in the spirit of\r\ndemocratization and in accordance of the latest world\r\ndevelopments, we note with satisfaction that the United\r\nNations as a guarantor of international peace, stability and\r\nsecurity has expanded its efforts through improving the\r\nmechanisms for maintaining peace and has intensified its\r\nactivities in the area of preventive diplomacy and the\r\nsettlement of regional conflicts, and has developed new\r\nconcepts and means for crisis management such as stand-\r\nby commitments and rapid-reaction forces. The Republic\r\nof Moldova welcomes the efforts of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament towards the adoption of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nAt present, goals likely to help overcome the\r\nfinancial crisis by finding the resources necessary for\r\neffective action by the United Nations are fundamental. In\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nour view, the reform of the United Nations must also cover\r\nthe financial aspect. We can attempt viable solutions only\r\nwith the participation of all Member States.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is not indifferent to this\r\nsituation and will make efforts to meet its financial\r\nobligations. However, it is my duty to stress that we are\r\nobliged to bear an assessment that is calculated at a level\r\nwhich is exaggerated in comparison with our real\r\npossibilities. This calculation has led to a situation where\r\nthe scale of assessments for our country is higher than that\r\nof States with a similar level of development. It is high\r\ntime that we found an appropriate methodology reflecting\r\nthe capacity to pay of States. We hope that the spirit of\r\nfairness and solidarity that reigns in the United Nations will\r\nlead the General Assembly to recommend that the\r\nCommittee on Contributions revise and readjust the scale of\r\nassessment to the level of indices that would truly reflect\r\nthe parameters of the economies of Member States. In this\r\ncontext, the Republic of Moldova supports the proposal of\r\nthe European Union regarding the methodology regarding\r\nthe calculation of the scale of assessments, which we\r\nconsider to be fairer and more appropriate to the real\r\npayment capacity of all Member States than that which is\r\nused now.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova supports United Nations\r\nreforms aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization and its main bodies, considering that this\r\ninnovative process reflects reality and the changes which\r\nhave occurred in the international system following the\r\ncold-war era.\r\nAt the same time, the Government of the Republic of\r\nMoldova attaches particular importance to the role the\r\nSecurity Council plays in preventing the development of\r\nnew threats to peace and international security. Developing\r\nconflicts, acts of aggression and interference in the internal\r\naffairs of States threaten regional and international security.\r\nThe role of the Security Council in avoiding these dangers\r\nis of prime importance. Aware of this role of the Security\r\nCouncil as a collective decision-making body in the area of\r\npeace and international security, the Republic of Moldova\r\nconsiders that a change in its composition must be carried\r\nout without hindering its effectiveness.\r\nMy delegation feels that an increase in the number of\r\nseats on the Security Council should be carried out in a\r\nbalanced way including both permanent and non-permanent\r\nseats, which would provide access for new members from\r\nboth the North and the South. As regards new permanent\r\nseats, the President of our Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mircea Snegur, proposed at the forty-ninth session of\r\nthe General Assembly that the status of permanent\r\nmember be given to the major economic Powers which\r\nplay an important role in economic affairs, such as\r\nGermany and Japan. As for the increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent seats, we find the Italian proposal\r\ninteresting, as it reflects the interests of most States\r\nMembers of the United Nations and offers a well-\r\nconsidered solution to this question.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is devoted to the\r\nprinciples and to the ideals of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, and greatly appreciates the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations, which for more than five decades has\r\nshown itself to be a forum for harmonizing the efforts of\r\nthe peoples of the world in order to maintain international\r\npeace and security and to ensure the development of\r\nrelations of friendship and cooperation among Member\r\nStates. The actions undertaken by the United Nations have\r\nfrom the very beginning pursued the goal of building new\r\nrelationships among countries of the whole world.\r\nAfter four years of activity as a full Member, the\r\nactions of the Republic of Moldova within the context of\r\nthe United Nations remain among the priorities of its\r\nforeign policy, aimed at giving our State a more active\r\npresence at the international level as well as at the\r\ndevelopment and intensification of relations of friendship\r\nand cooperation with all members of the international\r\ncommunity. The Republic of Moldova is in favour of\r\nharmonizing the interests of Member States.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the hope that\r\nthe particular constructive spirit of the United Nations\r\nwhich reigns once again at this session of the General\r\nAssembly will enable us to respond to the challenges\r\nfacing the international community at this time. I am\r\nconvinced that the United Nations will remain a guarantee\r\nof international peace and security and of economic and\r\nsocial development worldwide. My delegation expresses\r\nits willingness to contribute to effective cooperation with\r\nthe delegations of all Member States in order to attain the\r\npurposes of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nOne representative has requested to speak in exercise\r\nof the right of reply. I remind members that statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for\r\nthe first intervention and to five minutes for the second\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 24 September 1996\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nI call on the representative of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, who wishes to speak in exercise of the\r\nright of reply.\r\nMr. Chang Sik Se (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): Mr. Hashimoto, the Prime Minister of Japan, made\r\nremarks which aroused our immediate attention. His\r\nremarks were based on ignorance of the facts and were a\r\nclear demonstration of the character of a Japan without\r\nbackbone, which blindly follows the clamours of others. I\r\nwould like to ask him if Japan is in a position to make\r\nsuch remarks in this sacred international forum, which\r\ndiscusses universal political issues.\r\nAs for Mr. Hashimoto, he is one of the forces daily\r\nengaged in covering up Japan’s past crimes, without any\r\ngenuine apology or reparations, by visiting the Yasuguni\r\nShrine to appease the souls of war criminals.\r\nSuccessive Japanese authorities have pursued non-\r\nindependent external policies subordinate to the United\r\nStates and a one-sided policy in favour of South Korea.\r\nJapan is in a helpless position in which it cannot act other\r\nthan at South Korean’s instruction. Japan is not a party to\r\nthe four-party talks mentioned by Mr. Hashimoto. I\r\nshould like to ask him: If the four-party talks are to be\r\nheld, does he know what issues would be discussed? If\r\nthe issue of the withdrawal of United States troops from\r\nSouth Korea is to be addressed, is Japan ready to support\r\nthe four-party talks?\r\nOn this occasion I should like again to make clear\r\nthe position of the Democratic Republic of Korea that the\r\nattempt of Japan, which is without any independent\r\npolitical views whatsoever, to become a permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council is a mockery of world\r\npolitics. It would be better for Japan to apologize for the\r\ncrimes it committed against the Korean and other Asian\r\npeoples and make reparations for its past than to mislead\r\nworld public opinion.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
