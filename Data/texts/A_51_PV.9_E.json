(Malaysia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alija Izetbegović, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nMr. Alija Izetbegović, President of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Alija Izetbegović, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Izetbegović: I should first like to greet you,\r\nSir, and to wish you a successful term as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am also happy to inform the Assembly\r\nthat I come here today from Bosnia, where there is no\r\nkilling any more. I make both of these statements with\r\ngreat satisfaction.\r\nAllow me now to deliver a less optimistic page of my\r\naddress. While flying to New York the day before\r\nyesterday I read an article published in a prominent\r\nAmerican newspaper that dealt with the provision of the\r\nBosnian army with arms during the war. The author of the\r\narticle does not say so explicitly, but he implies that\r\neverything that is Muslim smells of terrorism. For him, it\r\nseems it is enough to have a Muslim name and to wear\r\na beard to be suspicious. The writer also mentions a\r\nnumber of people. Their only fault is that they helped the\r\nBosnian army to obtain some arms during the war. Today,\r\nthere are more than a billion Muslims world wide. I do\r\nnot know in whose interest it is, in this or similar articles,\r\nto push them into the embrace of the extremists.\r\nOur country and people went through hell. The\r\nworld deemed that it had the right to impose an arms\r\nembargo; we believed that we had the right to self-\r\ndefence. In a competition between those two rights, we\r\nbelieved, and we still believe, that our right was greater.\r\nTherefore, I am not going to apologize to anyone for our\r\nhaving done everything possible to secure arms in order\r\nto survive. On the contrary, I pay tribute to all brave\r\npeople, and express my gratitude to all of the friendly\r\ncountries that assisted us during the war. That page of our\r\nhistory is over, and we are turning to a new one: Peace.\r\nI thank the United States of America for starting the\r\ninitiative for peace and for making efforts, together with\r\nother countries, to strengthen this fragile and complex\r\npeace.\r\nWe are a small country, and we must pursue an\r\nopen and honest policy. Secret diplomacy and double\r\ngames are privileges of the mighty. For this and many\r\nother reasons, among which is also the aforementioned\r\narticle, I should like to reiterate some facts and our\r\nobjectives.\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is possible only as a\r\ndemocratic State of three equal nations and of free citizens.\r\nWe accept this fundamental provision of the Dayton Peace\r\nAgreement, with all of its consequences. That is, the well-\r\nknown formula: one State, two entities, three nations.\r\nIt is often considered that the Dayton Agreement is not\r\ngood enough. It is good because it has stopped the killing\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and because a better plan does\r\nnot exist. Its main deficiency is not in it, but in its\r\nimplementation. All of the bad aspects of the Agreement\r\ncould be improved if it were completely and consistently\r\nimplemented. Unfortunately, this is not the case. According\r\nto the provisions of the Agreement, “Herceg-Bosna”,\r\nestablished as a parallel State during the war, should cease\r\nto exist. But it still exists and impedes the building up of\r\nthe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe Dayton peace accord provides that the second\r\nentity, the Republika Srpska, should facilitate the return to\r\ntheir homes of more than half a million Bosniaks and\r\nCroats who have been expelled. This is not happening;\r\nrather, expulsions are continuing.\r\nGenerally speaking, the problem of the Dayton Peace\r\nAgreement lies in its selective, that is, partial\r\nimplementation. The Serbs, for instance, like paragraph 2\r\nof Annex 4, which mentions the Republika Srpska, yet they\r\ndo not like Annex 7, which demands the return of people\r\nwho have been expelled. They accept the first provision and\r\nreject the second one. The world, and above all, the Contact\r\nGroup members, should tell them explicitly that the Dayton\r\naccord is a whole. If there is no return of the expelled\r\npeople, there is no Republika Srpska. Otherwise, the\r\nDayton Agreement will grow from a small and bearable\r\ninjustice into a huge and intolerable injustice — and an\r\nintolerable injustice leads to new conflict.\r\nThe provisions of the Dayton Agreement stipulate that\r\nthere should be respect for human rights but, nevertheless,\r\nhuman rights are being violated more or less throughout the\r\nentire territory.\r\nThe September elections and the pre-election campaign\r\noffered an opportunity to test this in a very effective\r\nmanner. Conditions are particularly bad in this regard in the\r\nterritory of Republika Srpska. For the people from the\r\nFederation, neither before nor during the elections was there\r\nfreedom of movement, or it was very limited; and only\r\nSerbian political parties could act. Moreover, the electoral\r\nboards that registered the voters and counted the ballots\r\nconsisted in all cases of only one nation and, very often,\r\none party.\r\nWith regard to free media, significant progress has\r\nbeen achieved only in the territory of the legal Bosnian\r\nGovernment, where a large number of independent\r\nnewspapers and magazines, 40 radio stations, and 12\r\ntelevision stations operate. During the last 50 days of the\r\npre-election period, the ruling party had only one-tenth of\r\nthe allotted time available at prime time on the State\r\ntelevision station, Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nfrom 8 p.m. to 12 p.m., while opposition parties had nine-\r\ntenths of the allotted time at their disposal. The\r\nGovernment also granted preliminary approval to the\r\nOpen Broadcasting Network and stands ready to extend\r\nthis approval on the condition that the Open Broadcasting\r\nNetwork covers the entire territory of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and is open to all the political tendencies,\r\nleft and right.\r\nThe issue of Brcko will be solved by the main\r\nArbitrator, Mr. Roberts Owen, an American, since the\r\nSerbian side does not attend the meetings of the\r\nArbitration Commission. Both parties have presented their\r\narguments. I wish to emphasize that, in making his\r\ndecision, the Arbitrator will not be totally free. He is\r\nbound by respect for the principles of legality and equity,\r\nas explicitly stated in Annex 2, Article V of the Dayton\r\nAgreement.\r\nI will complete this brief analysis of the\r\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement by stating that\r\nthe main war criminals, Karadzić and Mladić, are still\r\nfree, in spite of Dayton, in spite of the orders of the\r\nHague Tribunal and in spite of the elementary demands\r\nof justice.\r\nWe would like to proclaim the principle of\r\nreconciliation of peoples and nations. Bosnia needs this.\r\nHere, no one advocates the idea of the collective guilt of\r\na nation. Guilt is always individual, regardless of the\r\nnumber of perpetrators. But for the people to be absolved\r\nand for the road towards reconciliation to be open, the\r\ncriminals must be punished. That is why the international\r\ntribunal in the Hague was established, but, as is well\r\nknown, neither the chief Prosecutor nor the President of\r\nthe Tribunal are satisfied with what the international\r\ncommunity is doing. In vain, they repeatedly indict the\r\nperpetrators and forward the warrants. Even on the issue\r\nof war crimes, the world is seeking some painless middle-\r\nground solution. When the issue of war crimes like those\r\ncommitted in Bosnia and Herzegovina comes into\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nquestion, every compromise is a shameful betrayal of\r\njustice. Unpunished war criminals will continue to poison\r\nthe world and ruin its institutions.\r\nSome people in Europe, and in the United States also,\r\nask whether, after everything that has happened, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is possible. These people either do not know\r\nthe facts or are morally corrupt. They do not know that on\r\nthe territory of the Serb entity, over half a million people,\r\n40 per cent of the indigenous pre-war population of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, were either killed or expelled, and they\r\nare totally indifferent to this fact. My answer is that if\r\ngenocide without punishment is possible, then Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is not possible.\r\nSo the real question is not whether the people can live\r\ntogether, it is more concrete and more straightforward: does\r\na larger nation have the right to expel a smaller nation and\r\nthen, under the slogan “we cannot live together”, usurp its\r\nproperty and demand that these violations be forgotten and\r\nlegalized? This is how the question “is Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina possible?” should be formulated. And for\r\npeople of principle and morality, the answer is clear.\r\nFinally, what should the future Government of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina do at this crucial and historic moment for\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina? In my opinion, it should be\r\nconstituted as a maximally representative Government\r\ncomposed of all the relevant political actors in conformity\r\nwith the results of the elections, including an opposition\r\nfrom both entities. It should thereafter proclaim that its\r\nprogramme consists of at least three points. First, it should\r\nrequest from all the signatories of the Dayton Peace\r\nAgreement that the Agreement be fully and consistently\r\nimplemented. At this moment, all the domestic as well as\r\ninternational actors, at least verbally, express their support\r\nfor this Agreement. The Government should hold them to\r\ntheir words. International pressure in this regard will be\r\nnecessary for a long time.\r\nSecondly, the Government should proclaim the\r\nreconciliation of the peoples and nations on the condition\r\nthat war criminals are prosecuted vigorously. And thirdly,\r\nthe Government should ensure freedom of the media as a\r\nway to heal the country. The media started the war several\r\nyears ago with the unprecedented spread of hatred. The\r\nmedia can have the same influence in strengthening peace\r\nthrough spreading tolerance and understanding among the\r\npeople. State radio and television were an appropriate\r\nexample during the election campaign. The Open\r\nBroadcasting Network could also contribute to this if it is\r\nopen to all ideas and all political directions and if it is\r\nregulated by Parliament.\r\nThis programme cannot be carried out by the\r\nGovernment alone. Bosnia and Herzegovina is still a\r\nrecovering patient and it needs the world’s support. The\r\npresence of international military forces will be\r\nindispensable for a certain limited period of time, and\r\neconomic assistance will be necessary for longer.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to say a few words\r\nabout the United Nations. We support reform of the\r\nUnited Nations system. The changes are necessary not\r\nonly in the Organization but in its psychology as well, if\r\nI may say so. Reform of the Security Council is also\r\nnecessary, in conformity with the changes in the world,\r\nand also to ensure a new attitude towards obligations. The\r\nUnited Nations must not undertake obligations it cannot\r\ncarry out. This is impermissible. My people have paid an\r\ninfinitely high price for this irresponsibility.\r\nThe “safe area” of Srebrenica and its more than\r\n8,000 innocent victims are not the only, but are the\r\ngravest, example of this incomprehensible attitude. We do\r\nnot know who is responsible, but we seek reforms which\r\nwill ensure that this will never happen again.\r\nYesterday, in this very building, I signed the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We are a small\r\ncountry, and my signature on that Treaty is not of great\r\nsignificance. Nevertheless, we want to participate, even if\r\nonly symbolically, in everything that is constructive. One\r\nday Bosnia and Herzegovina, through its representative,\r\nwill sign a treaty on the suppression of terrorism, and\r\nsome other day a treaty on the struggle against drugs and\r\norganized crime. I hope that in future Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina will join in any activity whose aim is to\r\nconfront evil, and that it will continually push the limits\r\nin the direction of good and towards a better and safer\r\nworld.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alija Izetbegović, President of the Republic of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker in the general debate\r\nthis morning will be His Excellency The Honourable\r\nAsterio R. Takesy, Secretary for External Affairs of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia.\r\nMr. Takesy (Federated States of Micronesia): Once\r\nagain, it is my honour as Secretary for External Affairs of\r\nthe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nFirst, I wish to thank the former President, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for his\r\nenlightened and skilful leadership during the historic fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nAs always, we acclaim the tireless dedication of\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who, throughout\r\nthe time of our membership, has worked unceasingly to\r\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument for\r\nthe betterment of our lives.\r\nThe people of my country are particularly pleased that\r\nyou, Mr. President, have been elected to lead this body\r\nduring its crucial fifty-first Session. Last year we celebrated\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and took stock\r\nof its accomplishments during the first half-century. Now\r\nwe begin in earnest to apply the commitments we made\r\ntowards the future of this Organization and the world.\r\nThere may be no other single individual who has been as\r\ninstrumental or as effective in leading the world community\r\nin recent years in the difficult search for common ground,\r\nparticularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We are heartened by your past achievements\r\nand are thankful for your willingness to undertake an even\r\ngreater commitment as our President during this session.\r\nThis is a year of strong reflection for the people of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia. Ten years have passed\r\nsince we emerged from the United Nations trusteeship\r\nsystem, and five years since we took our place as a\r\nmember of the United Nations. During these years we have\r\nworked hard to build our capacity to contribute, even as a\r\nremote small island State, to the advancement of our\r\ncommon goals. Despite severely limited resources, both in\r\nterms of personnel and finances, we have accorded high\r\npriority to our participation in United Nations activities and\r\nto meeting our financial commitments to this Organization.\r\nIt remains our strong belief that this priority has not been\r\nmisplaced.\r\nAt the time we joined the United Nations the\r\nworld’s attention was focusing on the global aspects of\r\nprotection of the environment and on the necessary\r\ninterrelationship between the environment and\r\ndevelopment. These were the subjects of the historic work\r\nat the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. Thanks in large\r\npart to you, Mr. President, that landmark United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED)\r\ngave us Agenda 21 and its associated mechanisms. Since\r\nthen, much has been accomplished through the work of\r\nmany institutions and individuals, such as the Commission\r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Policy Coordination and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, Mr. Nitin Desai. We look forward to the\r\nspecial session of this body next year which will be held\r\nto review progress during the first five years following\r\nUNCED and to appraise the effectiveness of the\r\ninstitutions that have grown up around it.\r\nIn the case of the Federated States of Micronesia,\r\nthis movement was very well timed. Just as our internal\r\nprocess of development began in earnest, we received\r\nguidance from Agenda 21 as to sustainability and the\r\nintegration of environmental protection and development.\r\nA short time later, at the Barbados Conference, which had\r\nbeen mandated by UNCED, we participated in analysing\r\nthe barriers to development faced by all small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nWhile we took encouragement from the international\r\nand regional aspects of Agenda 21 and the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action, we were also motivated to\r\nintegrate the Rio and Barbados outcomes into our own\r\nnational policies regarding development. Today our\r\nNational Council on Sustainable Development, chaired by\r\nour Vice-President, plays a central role in the formation\r\nof my country’s development policies. Since last year my\r\ncountry has been assisted by the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank in undertaking broad economic policy\r\nand governmental structural reforms with a view to\r\nstrengthening the private sector and optimizing efficiency\r\nin the public sector. We are taking serious steps to\r\ndownsize the public service workforce. At the same time,\r\nmeasures are being taken to raise Government revenues\r\nthrough tax-rate increases and support for the public\r\nsector. All of our public utility services, including\r\ntelecommunications, are being commercialized, while a\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\ngood number of our public-works services are being\r\nprivatized.\r\nMr. Azwai (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nFor a small island developing country such as the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, the condition and\r\nproductivity of our limited land areas, and of the seas that\r\nsurround us, are key to our survival. Only in recent times\r\nhave we, and others like us, come to realize the\r\nvulnerability and fragile nature of a world long taken for\r\ngranted. It is in the nature of islands to regard our\r\nremoteness as our primary protection against all dangers.\r\nBut the twentieth century has taught us how the land on\r\nwhich we live, and the resources of the sea on which we\r\ndepend, can be destroyed as a consequence of events that\r\ntake place far from our own shores. Thus, we are\r\ncompelled to raise our voice against long-standing actions\r\nand practices throughout the world as well as within our\r\nown region.\r\nAs long ago as 1972, Principle 21 of the Stockholm\r\nDeclaration established that national sovereignty can no\r\nlonger be asserted to justify actions that\r\n“cause damage to the environment of other States or\r\nof areas beyond (...) national jurisdiction.”\r\n(A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1, p. 5)\r\nThe affirmative responsibility of States to ensure the\r\navoidance of such damage is specifically reiterated in\r\nPrinciple 2 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. That responsibility is now recognized as a\r\ndoctrine of generally accepted international law.\r\nYet today we look back on a year during which, at\r\nbest, only mixed progress was made by the nations of the\r\nworld in discontinuing or regulating activities harmful to\r\nthe environment of others. Particularly in the region of the\r\nPacific Islands, our broad expanses and our helpless\r\npopulations continue to attract the interest of those who\r\nhave dirty, dangerous business to conduct. With regard to\r\nclimate change, our rising sea level and strengthening storm\r\nactivity sound an ominous warning of a global situation that\r\nwill engulf us if decisive action is not taken by the world\r\ncommunity now. Yet, over the past year, the political will\r\namong nations to adopt concrete measures has appeared, if\r\nanything, to be diminishing in the face of self-interested\r\nand determined manipulation of the very processes that we\r\nseek to apply.\r\nIt is not my purpose, however, to point with gloom\r\nto a glass half-empty, for we do take encouragement from\r\nthe ongoing hard work of thousands worldwide to address\r\na wide range of global security and environmental threats.\r\nWe are greatly relieved at the abatement, for now, of\r\nthe threat of nuclear war and by the cessation, finally, of\r\nnuclear-weapon testing. We hail the overwhelming\r\nmajority of United Nations Members that supported the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The\r\nFederated States of Micronesia took particular pride in\r\nstanding with other sponsors of the recent resolution\r\nadopted by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session,\r\nbecause Pacific Islanders were among the first, and may\r\nyet prove to be the last actual, not potential, victims of\r\none of history’s darkest periods. We congratulate the five\r\nnuclear Powers on their major role in achieving this\r\nmilestone, and we call on all Members to join us in\r\nsigning the Treaty, as I did here yesterday on behalf of\r\nmy country. The CTBT is a major step towards the total\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. We hold that to be the\r\nultimate objective and obligation of the international\r\ncommunity and the global environment.\r\nAnother difficult problem associated with the\r\ntechnology of mass destruction and with the nuclear age\r\nis the disposition of dangerous waste, by-products and\r\ncastoffs, which themselves pose very real risks of mass\r\ncalamity to those unfortunate enough to be caught in the\r\npath of accidents. We credit the honest intentions of those\r\nwho insist upon carrying out movements of plutonium\r\nand other hazardous materials throughout our region to do\r\nso as carefully as they can. We accept and rely upon the\r\nword of those who have brought their hazardous materials\r\nto our region for destruction that they will conduct this\r\nactivity only a little longer. We welcome the recent\r\nannouncement by the United States administration of its\r\nopposition to plans to establish a nuclear-waste storage\r\nfacility on Palmyra Atoll in our region. But experience\r\nhas shown that good intentions are not always sufficient\r\nprotection. We must also rely on global mechanisms such\r\nas the Basel and London Conventions, and on regional\r\nactions to establish zones of protection, such as under the\r\nNoumea Convention and the recently concluded Waigani\r\nTreaty.\r\nI emphasize that the progress made in all these areas\r\nis not lost on us. However, if our children and their\r\nchildren are to inherit a livable world, we must all\r\nsomehow find a way now to take seriously the message\r\nof the Stockholm Declaration. We must face the hard fact\r\nthat each time the preventive and precautionary principles\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nare placed on hold to allow some offending activity to\r\ncontinue “just a little longer,” the global resolve expressed\r\nat Rio and reflected in many actions since is seriously\r\nundermined. Glacial progress is better than no progress, but\r\nit is not enough where the stakes are literally apocalyptic.\r\nAs much as we support the process of the Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, it appears that intensive\r\nnegotiations are leading in the direction of elaborate\r\ncompromises that might represent masterful diplomatic\r\nachievement, but fall far short of effectively addressing the\r\nConvention’s objective. Recently, at the second Conference\r\nof the Parties in Geneva, we witnessed a sorry spectacle in\r\nwhich a few delegations blocked the negotiators even from\r\ntaking note of a critical and unanimous scientific finding,\r\nnamely that\r\n“there is a discernible human influence on the global\r\nclimate”.\r\nIt fell to the ministers in attendance to make their own\r\ndeclaration recognizing the obvious importance of this and\r\nother findings in the second Assessment Report of the\r\nInterdepartmental Panel on Climate Change.\r\nWhen there exists this degree of helplessness on the\r\npart of a great majority to come to grips with a problem,\r\neven after the denial factor has been laid to rest, one begins\r\nto fear that we lack the capacity to save ourselves from\r\nourselves. There is too little time remaining before the next\r\nConference of the Parties in Kyoto, where it is anticipated\r\nthat a protocol or other legal instrument will be adopted\r\nthat sets specific targets and timetables for emissions\r\nreductions beyond the year 2000. That action will determine\r\nwhether the Convention can indeed serve to address the\r\nthreat of global climate change. Yet, at this point, the only\r\nspecific suggested text, tabled by the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States, is regarded by some larger industrialized\r\ncountries to be overreaching, even as a first step. The\r\noutlook is not encouraging.\r\nThanks to the work of the IPCC in producing its\r\nlandmark second Assessment Report, we now know that\r\ndue to the inertia of the Earth’s climate system in adjusting\r\nto changed inputs, it is already too late to prevent\r\nsignificant loss of land areas and habitability due to sea-\r\nlevel rise during the upcoming century. We must therefore\r\nbegin in earnest to contemplate measures to adapt to, and\r\ndefend against, these consequences. In order to implement\r\nsuch measures, island countries will require the financial\r\nand technological support of the industrialized world.\r\nWithout it, tens of millions of people on islands and in low-\r\nlying coastal areas throughout the world are certain to\r\nbecome homeless. No longer can the world afford to\r\nleave the development of adaptation measures on the back\r\nburner. We must begin to act now.\r\nAs a nation covering over 1 million square miles of\r\nocean, we place great importance on the sustainable use\r\nand management of marine resources within and adjacent\r\nto our territorial limits. We are pleased with the entry into\r\nforce of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea, which has provided us with a framework to deal\r\nwith many important issues in this field. The resulting\r\nmanagement mechanisms are of particular importance to\r\nthose of us surrounded entirely by oceans.\r\nOther encouraging events have included the opening\r\nfor signature of the Agreement on straddling fish stocks\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks in December 1995, and\r\nthe election last month of 21 judges for the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. Furthermore, we note\r\nwith great satisfaction the election in Kingston, Jamaica,\r\nof an esteemed Pacific Islander, Mr. Satya Nandan of Fiji,\r\nas the first Secretary-General of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority. With his election and the subsequent actions of\r\nthe Assembly of the Authority last month, the Authority\r\nis finally in place as called for in Part XI of the\r\nConvention. With a substantial percentage of the global\r\nmineral resources lying beneath the surface of the oceans,\r\nthe International Seabed Authority has a crucial role in\r\nensuring that the ocean environment is protected\r\nthroughout the process of exploitation. In this connection,\r\nit is important for the General Assembly to provide\r\nadequate financial resources to the International Seabed\r\nAuthority during this session, as it has done with other\r\nbodies, until States Parties can assume the responsibility\r\nnext year.\r\nOne of the great learning experiences we have had\r\nduring our early years of United Nations membership has\r\nbeen appreciating the need for us all, collectively, to act,\r\nby example and with determination, to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of people, wherever they are, who are denied\r\ntheir basic rights as human beings. The Constitution of\r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia reflects in its\r\nDeclaration of Rights the standards ingrained in our\r\nculture over many centuries, and it has perhaps given us\r\na certain sense of complacency in this area. But we have\r\ncome to appreciate that the worldwide collective effort to\r\nconfront human rights issues both strengthens our own\r\nsociety and affords us an opportunity to participate in\r\nhelping others.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nDespite the inevitable impact of increased contacts\r\nwith modern Western society, the most important aspects\r\nand values of our traditional cultures remain strong, because\r\nthey are appropriate to our circumstances. We continue to\r\nadhere to the concept of the extended family, for example,\r\nand many of the principles that are inherent in that system\r\nhave long ensured a respect in our society for basic human\r\nrights.\r\nChanging times, however, inevitably challenge old\r\ntraditions, and the maintenance of our traditional human\r\nrights standards becomes a process of adaptation to our\r\nincreasingly mobile and homogeneous society, in which\r\nlegal and governmental institutions must now also play a\r\ncentral role. Here we stand to benefit by involvement and\r\nparticipation in the international human rights movement,\r\nas was pointed out by our Vice-President in his address to\r\nthe World Conference in Vienna several years ago.\r\nAs we have studied the mechanisms and obligations of\r\nthe various United Nations Treaties on human rights, we\r\nhave entered into constructive internal debates. Children, for\r\nexample, are among our most important treasures, and so\r\nwe first acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. The preparation of our first report to that Convention\r\nwas a thought-provoking exercise. Traditionally, women in\r\nisland cultures have been treated with love and respect, but\r\nhave not participated fully in public affairs. This is\r\nbeginning to change. We recently sent a strong delegation\r\nto the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, and\r\nare actively considering accession to the Convention on the\r\nElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.\r\nOverall, we realize that our own application of human\r\nrights standards must evolve progressively along with our\r\nsociety.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia also accepts the\r\nresponsibility of continuing to speak out, along with\r\nsimilarly committed States, on the need to challenge those\r\nGovernments that still refuse to accord their own citizens\r\nthe fundamental rights of human beings. It is a long and\r\noften discouraging process, but only with a strong, constant,\r\ncollective voice can the international community maintain\r\nthe progress being made in exposing and deterring abuses\r\nby the powerful against the unempowered.\r\nMuch attention has been drawn in the past several\r\nyears to the serious financial condition of the United\r\nNations and the need to reform and restructure it. Some\r\nMembers are so disheartened by the slow pace of this effort\r\nthat they have lost their resolve to maintain their own\r\nfinancial commitments to the United Nations, making the\r\nproblems worse and threatening the continued ability of\r\nthis Organization to carry out its work.\r\nIt is the view of the Federated States of Micronesia\r\nthat while there may be inequities in the structure of\r\nassessments, Member States should address them while\r\ncontinuing to meet existing commitments that were\r\nestablished pursuant to agreed procedures. There will\r\nalways be some level of disagreement over structures and\r\nthe requirements of funding. But it would be a tragedy of\r\nhistoric proportions if the pursuit of the goals of the\r\nCharter were substantially hindered by Member States\r\nthat feel that they can rightfully tailor their contributions\r\nto their own satisfaction according to how their particular\r\ndemands are met. The fact is that, when we give due\r\nregard to the importance of our overall work here, this\r\nOrganization, even without reform, is well worth its\r\ncost — especially when one considers the sums spent by\r\nnations on activities that do not contribute to international\r\npeace and development.\r\nThere is no doubt that, as we begin the next half\r\ncentury of work, the capacity of this Organization is\r\nchallenged by issues that seem to grow rapidly in number\r\nand complexity. But this is not a sign of failure, nor of a\r\nlack of capacity. Neither does it suggest that we need\r\nanother instrument. It is, rather, an indication of the\r\nincreasing interconnectedness of the global community\r\nand of the growing inclination among nations to find and\r\nrecognize their common interests and to work together to\r\nadvance those interests.\r\nIn order to maintain and improve the responsiveness\r\nof the United Nations in a world in which it faces\r\nincreasing demands, it is necessary that, on a continuing\r\nbasis, we apply effective upgrades to the way we do our\r\nwork here. Only in this way can we keep the\r\nOrganization on a positive course, and faithfully translate\r\nthe mandates of the Charter into terms of continuing\r\nrelevance. This is the real meaning of reform. It is not a\r\nconsequence of past inadequacy, but a positive\r\nevolutionary development.\r\nThat is easily said, but as we all know, it is very\r\ndifficult to put into practice. Even so we must not allow\r\nthat high degree of difficulty to plunge us into frustration\r\nand defeat. The great achievements of those who have\r\nbeen here before us over the last 50 years must be\r\nhonoured by our unshakable determination to take the\r\nUnited Nations into the next millennium as the single\r\nmost effective multilateral instrument for the betterment\r\nof mankind.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nI believe that this Assembly can and will accomplish\r\nmuch to add to the list of tangible achievements both for\r\nthe direct benefit of the peoples of the world and for the\r\nimprovement of this Organization itself. We have the\r\nhistory, the vision and the leadership. Moreover, the\r\nurgency is clearly seen by us all. Let us resolve to apply\r\nourselves as never before, and to live up to the great\r\npotential that resides in this Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on Mr. Wolfgang Schussel, Deputy Prime Minister\r\nand Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria.\r\nMr. Schussel (Austria): We are glad to see the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the key organ in the reform process of\r\nthe Organization, meet under a President who combines\r\nprofound knowledge of the United Nations with a\r\nreputation for strong leadership.\r\nMy colleague from Ireland has already outlined the\r\npositions of the European Union, which we fully endorse.\r\nI will elaborate on a few points to which Austria attaches\r\nparticular importance.\r\nWhen discussing the need for reform a year ago,\r\nHeads of State and Government expressed their political\r\nwill to give the twenty-first century a United Nations\r\nequipped, financed and structured to serve effectively the\r\npeoples in whose name it was established. However,\r\ninsufficient progress has been made so far in implementing\r\nthis commitment. While the Secretary-General, to whose\r\nspirited leadership of the Organization I should like to pay\r\na warm personal tribute, has undertaken a number of\r\nimportant reform initiatives, the Working Groups of the\r\nGeneral Assembly have made only limited progress. Much\r\nmore needs to be done. And we must always bear in mind\r\nthat reform is not mere downsizing, but pursuing our goals\r\neffectively and efficiently. Four principles should, in our\r\nview, guide our reform agenda. As the first priority and as\r\na precondition for reform, we must fulfil our financial\r\nobligations in accordance with the United Nations Charter;\r\nwe must give clear mandates and provide the necessary\r\nresources; we must ensure the competitiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations system; and we must eliminate duplication,\r\nwaste and mismanagement.\r\nWe should like to see strong United Nations leadership\r\nin the following areas.\r\nAs regards human rights, the results of the World\r\nConference on Human Rights form an integral part of the\r\ncoordinated follow-up to recent United Nations conferences.\r\nAustria will play an active role in preparations for the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and the five-year review of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action in 1998. Today,\r\nour main task is not to elaborate new international\r\nstandards in the field of human rights but to ensure full\r\nrespect for the broad body of existing norms and rules in\r\nall parts of the world. This requires the active\r\ninvolvement of the entire United Nations system. This\r\nincludes United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) projects on governance; the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund’s efforts in the field of juvenile justice;\r\nprogrammes of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\r\nBranch of the Secretariat for the strengthening of criminal\r\njustice systems; and the integration of human rights\r\nelements into United Nations field missions. In the run-up\r\nto 1998, system-wide cooperation and integration in the\r\nfield of human rights have to be improved.\r\nAustria pays particular attention to the promotion\r\nand protection of minorities as a means both to prevent\r\nand to resolve conflicts. Respecting the rights of\r\nminorities is crucial for peaceful development and good\r\nneighbourly relations. The case of South Tyrol is an\r\nexcellent example. Half a century after the conclusion of\r\nthe 1946 Treaty of Paris between Austria and Italy — of\r\nfundamental importance for the survival of the Austrian\r\nminority — the South Tyroleans enjoy the protection of\r\na carefully regulated autonomy, which increasingly serves\r\nas an inspiration in comparable situations elsewhere.\r\nTurning next to drug control and organized crime, it\r\nis estimated that drug sales generate more than\r\n$120 billion annually, thus exceeding the gross domestic\r\nproduct of many United Nations Member States. This\r\neconomic power of drug traffickers is a serious threat to\r\nthe stability and the democratic and legal institutions of\r\nmany countries. Drug abuse also has severe social\r\nconsequences for societies and individuals. Therefore,\r\ndrug control must remain a top priority for the United\r\nNations. Austria will welcome the holding of a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in 1998 devoted to this\r\nquestion. In order to make that session a success, we\r\nshould soon start our preparations at the national, regional\r\nand international levels.\r\nTrafficking in illicit drugs goes hand in hand with\r\ntransnational organized crime and money laundering,\r\nwhich can be fought only through intensified international\r\ncooperation. In this regard, we encourage closer\r\ncooperation between the United Nations International\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nDrug Control Programme and the Secretariat’s crime\r\nDivision.\r\nI turn now to fight against the sexual exploitation of\r\nchildren. A phenomenon closely linked to organized crime\r\nis the sexual exploitation of children; this contemporary\r\nform of slavery can result in serious, life-long, even life-\r\nthreatening consequences for the physical, psychological\r\nand social development of children. The rights of children\r\nand women being at the very heart of our concern, we\r\nwould like in this respect to reiterate the importance we\r\nattach to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as\r\nwell as to the recommendations of the recent Stockholm\r\nWorld Congress on Commercial Sexual Exploitation of\r\nChildren. We are convinced that only a global partnership\r\nuniting Governments, non-governmental organizations and\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies can bring an end to the\r\ntrafficking and exploitation of children and women for\r\nsexual purposes.\r\nPeace-keeping remains the international community\u0027s\r\nmajor tool to assist parties to a conflict in the\r\nimplementation of peace agreements or to provide a rapid\r\nresponse to complex emergencies. In view of lessons\r\nlearned from previous missions, we actively support the\r\nimprovement of the rapid deployment capability of the\r\nOrganization, including the establishment of a rapidly\r\ndeployable headquarters.\r\nCurrently, some 1,200 Austrians — troop contingents,\r\nmilitary observers, civilian police and civilians — are\r\nserving in United Nations missions and in the\r\nImplementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe will continue to participate in such operations. In this\r\ncontext, I am pleased to announce that my country will\r\nparticipate in the system of stand-by arrangements. We will\r\nalso continue to assist the United Nations in its efforts to\r\nimprove the quality of peace-keeping personnel through our\r\nparticipation in the United Nations training assistance team\r\nprogramme. International training centres in Austria offer\r\ntraining programmes for military as well as civilian\r\npersonnel. We have joined forces with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in the strengthening of conflict\r\nprevention and peace-keeping capacities in Africa.\r\nAs regards preventive diplomacy, over the last few\r\nyears, we have witnessed an increase in the deployment of\r\nsmall political field missions. They play an important role\r\nin the preventive diplomacy efforts of the Secretary-General\r\nand his Special Representatives, and in the coordination of\r\npeace-building initiatives. Austria encourages the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to make more use of this cost-effective instrument.\r\nWe therefore support his proposal to establish clear\r\nbudgetary procedures ensuring a sound and predictable\r\nfinancial basis for such missions.\r\nThe United Nations took the lead in developing the\r\nconcept of post-conflict peace-building. Today, not only\r\nthe United Nations but also the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) and the World Bank, the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) are elaborating concepts of how to assist in the\r\nconsolidation of peace and the prevention of the\r\nrecurrence of conflicts. The objective of peace-building is\r\npolitical, but it often requires action in the economic,\r\nsocial, humanitarian or human rights fields.\r\nThe broad variety of available instruments is amply\r\ndemonstrated by a recent survey of the United Nations\r\nsystem’s capabilities in post-conflict reconstruction\r\ncompiled by the Vienna-based Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment Support Unit of the Secretariat.\r\nThe ability of the United Nations system to act in an\r\nintegrated manner in peace-building represents a test for\r\nits overall ability to reform and to modernize. We call\r\nupon the Secretary-General to develop comprehensive\r\ncriteria and operational guidelines, including on the\r\nquestion of leadership for peace-building activities. We\r\nalso encourage the Secretary-General to intensify his\r\ncooperation with international financial institutions and\r\nother relevant actors in this field.\r\nAs regards regional conflicts, time constraints\r\nprevent me from addressing in detail the many situations\r\nin all parts of the world where the international\r\ncommunity, often under the leadership of the United\r\nNations, has attempted to bring conflicts and human\r\nsuffering to an end — as in the Great Lakes region of\r\nAfrica, Liberia and Afghanistan. I will limit myself to a\r\nconflict in our immediate neighbourhood, namely the\r\nsituation in the Balkans: in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nMy country follows developments there with both\r\ngreat hope and great concern. The implementation of the\r\nDayton Peace Agreement lags behind our expectations,\r\nespecially in the civilian field. However, we must not\r\noverlook the foremost achievement of this Agreement: the\r\nfact that a very brutal and bloody war was stopped and\r\nthat the road for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s return to\r\nnormalcy was paved. It is an encouraging sign that\r\nballots, and no longer bullets, are in place.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nThe elections held on 14 September represent a vital\r\nstep forward and indicate the Bosnian people’s\r\ndetermination to continue with the peace process. The\r\nsetting up of common institutions, as foreseen by the\r\nDayton Agreement, is now the number-one task.\r\nNotwithstanding the primary responsibility of the parties\r\nthemselves to fully implement the Dayton peace accords, it\r\nis indispensable that the international community not\r\nabandon the country after the expiration of the IFOR\r\nmandate by the end of this year. We will have to continue\r\nto assist the people and authorities of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina in their efforts to rebuild a civil society and to\r\nstrengthen reconciliation among ethnic groups.\r\nSustainable management of environmental resources to\r\nensure both human progress and human survival poses a\r\nmajor challenge at the outset of the twenty-first century. At\r\npresent, we are compromising the ability of future\r\ngenerations to meet their own needs. The United Nations\r\nhas a crucial role to play in achieving a common\r\nunderstanding of sustainability and in promoting its\r\nimplementation. We therefore attach great importance to\r\nnext year’s special session of the General Assembly on the\r\noverall review and appraisal of Agenda 21. The special\r\nsession should not only assess the implementation of the\r\nRio commitments, but should also elaborate a global\r\nconsensus on new important areas such as sustainable\r\nconsumption, production patterns, energy and transport.\r\nThe process of globalization also profoundly changes\r\nthe parameters of social development in all countries. The\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development took up this\r\nchallenge and agreed on a set of principles, goals and\r\ncommitments to enhance the benefits and mitigate the\r\nnegative effects of this process. We welcome the\r\ndetermination of the United Nations system to translate the\r\noutcome of the Copenhagen Summit into its operational\r\nwork for the benefit of all people.\r\nWe are striving nationally to meet our commitments\r\neven in times of budgetary cuts. I avail myself of this\r\nopportunity to recall the Austrian invitation to hold a\r\nregional follow-up conference to the social Summit in\r\nVienna at the end of 1997 or the beginning of 1998.\r\nMy next point is disarmament. A more cooperative\r\napproach to security is to provide a setting conducive to\r\ngiving new impetus to international disarmament and arms\r\ncontrol. Serious efforts must be undertaken to eliminate\r\nweapons of mass destruction and to strengthen the various\r\narms control and non-proliferation regimes. At the same\r\ntime, more attention should be devoted to areas of\r\nconventional disarmament, such as the United Nations\r\nRegister of Conventional Arms, small arms and arms\r\ntransfers, as well as to the further development of\r\nuniversal regimes of transparency in armaments. The\r\nWassenaar Arrangement, recently established in Vienna,\r\nwill make an important contribution to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn response to the human tragedy of civilian\r\nlandmine victims, Austria has been one of the first\r\ncountries to establish a total moratorium on anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, and is aiming for an agreement on a\r\nworldwide total ban on this scourge of humanity.\r\nThe approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) constitutes a milestone on our path\r\ntowards a more secure future, leaving behind the nuclear\r\nweapons competition that defined the cold war. Austria\r\nwelcomes the test moratoriums announced by all five\r\ndeclared nuclear-weapon States, and we call on all States\r\nto work on the rapid ratification of the CTBT in order to\r\nfoster nuclear non-proliferation and to spare this planet\r\nfurther ecological damage.\r\nThe organization for the CTBT and, pending entry\r\ninto force, its preparatory commission, will play a vital\r\nrole in verifying the implementation of the test ban.\r\nAustria considers it an honour to host such an important\r\ninternational organization and will contribute its share to\r\ncreating favourable working conditions. The position of\r\nVienna, which already hosts the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), as the centre of global nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation is further strengthened by the addition of\r\ncrucial nuclear verification facilities.\r\nThis fight can be won only by pursuing a double-\r\ntracked approach: on one track, non-proliferation is a\r\nprecondition for ridding ourselves of the risk of nuclear\r\ndestruction. On the other track, the nuclear-weapon States\r\nare called upon to honour their obligation under the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) to disarm their nuclear arsenals with the ultimate\r\ngoal of the complete elimination of these weapons.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to play a\r\nleading role in the progressive development of\r\ninternational law. Austria highly esteems the work of the\r\nInternational Law Commission. Currently the elaboration\r\nof a statute for an international criminal court is of utmost\r\nimportance. Austria strongly supports the early\r\nestablishment of the court, to end the widespread culture\r\nof impunity.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nFinally, I would like to mention the United Nations\r\nOffice at Vienna: our strong commitment to the United\r\nNations also manifests itself in Austria’s role as one of the\r\nheadquarters of the Organization. United Nations\r\nprogrammes and agencies based in Vienna represent highly\r\nimportant instruments in international efforts to meet new\r\nthreats to peace, security and development. I am referring\r\nto the key role of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nin preventing nuclear proliferation; that of the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme and the\r\nUnited Nations crime Division, which fight against drug\r\nabuse, money laundering, organized crime and corruption;\r\nof the Office for Outer Space Affairs, the principal United\r\nNations body for international cooperation in the peaceful\r\nuses of outer space; of the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the central\r\ncoordinating agency for information, analysis, advice and\r\nassistance in the field of sustainable industrial development;\r\nand of the United Nations Commission on International\r\nTrade Law (UNCITRAL), the international centre for the\r\npromotion, harmonization and unification of the law of\r\ninternational trade. We would like to pay tribute to\r\nUNCITRAL for the able manner in which it is carrying out\r\nits task. The Austrian Government is looking forward to\r\ncelebrating the Commission’s thirtieth anniversary on the\r\noccasion of its next meeting, in spring 1997 in Vienna.\r\nOver the years, the IAEA and the United Nations\r\nOffice at Vienna have understood the importance of\r\nbuilding a solid reputation for good and lean management.\r\nUNIDO has undergone drastic reforms, streamlining its\r\nsecretariat and clearly defining its priorities and areas of\r\nconcern. As one of the host countries of the United\r\nNations, we are particularly committed to the reform efforts\r\nbeing undertaken by these organizations and by the United\r\nNations system as a whole. We shall support all efforts to\r\nfulfil the commitments we all agreed on last year, to make\r\nthe United Nations fit for the twenty-first century.\r\nAddress by Mr. Janez Drnovšek, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by the Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Janez Drnovšek, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia, His Excellency Mr. Janez\r\nDrnovšek, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Drnovšek (Slovenia): Please allow me to\r\ncongratulate the President and his country, Malaysia, on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the fifty-first session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We hold his many contributions to\r\nthe work of the United Nations in very high regard and\r\nwe are convinced that his wisdom will guide this session\r\nof the General Assembly to a successful completion.\r\nI also take advantage of this occasion to thank\r\nProfessor Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for his\r\nwise and dignified leadership of the General Assembly at\r\nits jubilee fiftieth session.\r\nThe first half-century of the United Nations has\r\nelapsed and the General Assembly is meeting at a time of\r\ngreat opportunities. Seldom has the United Nations\r\nenjoyed such a high level of freedom from friction in the\r\nrelations among the major Powers of the world.\r\nMoreover, our time is also one of profound and promising\r\nchange. Never before has the world been better equipped\r\nto seize the opportunities of economic and technological\r\ndevelopment for the benefit of all. The democratic\r\ntransformation which has taken place in large parts of the\r\nworld has substantially improved the quality of life and\r\nadded important opportunities for a large part of the\r\nworld’s population.\r\nHowever, very serious problems persist. Poverty and\r\nsocial disintegration, environmental degradation and new\r\nforms of threat to international peace and security are\r\nserious dangers to our common future. The fact that our\r\nworld is no longer threatened by cold war rivalries offers\r\nlittle consolation if we think of the dangers which cast\r\ntheir shadows on our path towards the future. The unique\r\nopportunities of our time can be forfeited.\r\nNever before has the time been so precious and the\r\nneed for effective global action so clear. The United\r\nNations must be able to adjust so as to become more\r\neffective and more successful in addressing the challenges\r\nat hand. The essence of the principal task before the\r\nUnited Nations today can be captured in two words:\r\nadjustment and modernization. The compelling need to\r\nadjust and modernize the Organization should be guiding\r\nits activities, in particular those aiming at its reform.\r\nHowever, the United Nations experience of the\r\nreform efforts of the past year has not been entirely\r\nsatisfactory. The progress of various working groups of\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nthe General Assembly has been slow, a fact to be noted\r\nwith concern. The present session of the General Assembly\r\nand its general debate should provide fresh incentives and\r\nenergize the process of reform, which should proceed in a\r\ncoherent and balanced manner.\r\nThe process of downsizing the Secretariat, while being\r\nwelcome and necessary, should become part of a wider\r\nchange characterized by a clear definition of the priorities\r\nof the United Nations and by an adequate allocation of its\r\nhuman and material resources. Greater discipline must be\r\nachieved in the financing of the United Nations. This\r\nshould be accompanied by a new, more balanced scale of\r\nassessments. Furthermore, innovative forms of financing\r\nshould be devised, in particular in such domains as the\r\nprotection of environment and sustainable development.\r\nLast but not least, there is, in several parts of the United\r\nNations, a need for structural change. The necessary\r\nexpansion and reform of the Security Council — which\r\nincludes reasonable enlargement — is a case in point. It is\r\nobvious that the efforts at reform should go hand in hand\r\nwith the implementation of the basic tasks of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe preservation of international peace and security is\r\nthe principal objective of the United Nations. One of the\r\nareas of implementation of this objective that is constantly\r\ngaining importance is cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations in the common efforts\r\nfor world peace. We see possibilities in different parts of\r\nthe world for the creation of durable security arrangements\r\nbased on regional organizations and their cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe shall continue to support the efforts for\r\ncoordination and cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations through such methods as\r\nincreased consultation, diplomatic support, mutual\r\noperational support and joint operations, in accordance with\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn Europe, the role of such regional organizations as\r\nthe European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope is constantly growing. We welcome and support the\r\ngrowing complementarity and cooperation between these\r\norganizations and the United Nations.\r\nDisarmament continues to be among the most\r\nimportant areas in which the role of the United Nations is\r\nfundamental. It can be said that, in recent years, the United\r\nNations has solidified its leading and coordinating role in\r\nthis area. The agreement on the non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons achieved last year and the conclusion of\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention are witness to that.\r\nSlovenia welcomes the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which\r\nwe signed yesterday. Slovenia took an active approach\r\nfrom the very beginning to the CTBT negotiations. We\r\ndeeply believe that only strict implementation of the\r\nTreaty can contribute to a safer world in the future.\r\nThe interaction between the Conference on\r\nDisarmament and the relevant United Nations bodies has\r\nintensified. We should strive to improve further the\r\ndisarmament machinery. In this context, we note with\r\nregret that the project of expansion of the membership of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament remains incomplete. We\r\ncontinue to believe that all States willing and able to\r\ncontribute to international disarmament efforts should be\r\nenabled to participate in the Conference on Disarmament\r\nas full members. Slovenia wishes to be and is capable of\r\nbeing among the members of the Conference.\r\nSlovenia also supports activities of the international\r\ncommunity needed to limit and eventually eliminate the\r\nuse of inhumane and excessively injurious weapons —\r\nincluding anti-personnel landmines — and is ready to take\r\nan active part in these efforts.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the process of return to\r\nnormality has started. Less than a year ago, Slovenia\r\njoined all the members of the international community in\r\nexpressing appreciation to the United States of America\r\nand all others involved in the preparation of the Dayton\r\nAgreement.\r\nAfter many years of tragically futile exercises, the\r\nmoment has come for a decisive step towards real peace\r\nin Bosnia and in the Balkans. The military action of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization gave credibility to the\r\nwritten word and created conditions for a comprehensive\r\neffort to rebuild Bosnia and Herzegovina economically,\r\npolitically and socially. In Slovenia, we welcomed the\r\nholding of the presidential and parliamentarian elections\r\nwhich took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina 10 days ago\r\nas a positive step forward and as a substantial\r\ncontribution to peace and stability in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Within the framework of post-conflict\r\nmanagement of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nthere is a growing need to ensure economic reconstruction\r\nand provide adequate economic aid. Slovenia is actively\r\nparticipating in the international efforts for the economic\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nreconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina and still hosts\r\nmany Bosnian refugees.\r\nSlovenia is a young country that obtained United\r\nNations membership in May 1992. Over the past five years\r\nof independence, Slovenia achieved positive results in the\r\nprocess of political and economic transformation. Growing\r\ncooperation with its neighbours and in the region enabled\r\nSlovenia to reach a high degree of economic and political\r\nstability. We strongly believe that such a policy is to be\r\nobserved as a contribution to the sustainable stability of the\r\nregion.\r\nAfter a successful transformation, Slovenia is now\r\nready to take its share of responsibility not only for\r\nregional arrangements, but also for international peace and\r\nstability. That is why Slovenia seeks to become a Security\r\nCouncil member for the 1998-1999 term: to participate\r\nactively in the Council’s central role in developing an\r\neffective system of global security at a time when the\r\nSecurity Council faces significant challenges to international\r\npeace and security. We firmly believe that Slovenia is able\r\nto meet all expectations and to work with other member\r\nStates so as to make a full contribution to fulfilling the\r\ndemanding tasks of the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of Slovenia for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nDr. Janez Drnovšek, Prime Minister of Slovenia, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Cooperation of the\r\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg, His Excellency Mr. Jacques\r\nPoos.\r\nMr. Poos (interpretation from French): Allow me first\r\nof all to congratulate the President most warmly on his\r\nelection to serve as President of the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI also wish to convey my thanks to the previous\r\nPresident, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for the commitment, skill\r\nand poise with which he led our work at the last session of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nI would also like to convey my appreciation to our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\r\nongoing outstanding work for our Organization since\r\nbeginning of his term.\r\nThe views of the Luxembourg Government on the\r\nmajor international issues are the same as those expressed\r\nby our European Union partners. They were presented to\r\nthe Assembly yesterday morning by Mr. Dick Spring,\r\nPresident of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Ireland.\r\nLuxembourg learned with great satisfaction that our\r\nGeneral Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, had\r\nadopted and opened for signature the resolution\r\ncontaining the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nYesterday, on behalf of the Luxembourg Government, I\r\nsigned that document, which marks substantial progress\r\ntowards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\r\ncreation of a safer and more humane world. I hope that\r\nthe parties concerned will continue to work to create the\r\nright conditions for the rapid entry into force of this\r\nTreaty.\r\nAlso in the area of disarmament, I support without\r\nreserve the United Nations work on the question of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, which day after day, long after the\r\nguns have fallen silent in a conflict, continue to claim\r\ncountless victims. If there is any evil which must be\r\neradicated, this is it.\r\nI rejoice in the significant progress which has been\r\nachieved, in less than a year, in the conflict in the former\r\nYugoslavia. I welcome the holding of elections on 14\r\nSeptember, which marks a decisive stage for the future of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnians, Serbs and Croats must\r\nnow organize their cooperation by first setting up\r\ncommon institutions.\r\nI regard these elections as a first, important step in\r\nthe framework of a process of democratization and\r\nstabilization that must be carried further. Its success will\r\ndepend above all on the Bosnian parties. It will also\r\ndepend on neighbouring countries, in particular Croatia\r\nand the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Lastly, it will\r\ndepend on the support of the international community. My\r\nGovernment is in favour of continued international\r\ncivilian and military action in order to create the\r\nenvironment required to preserve peace and prevent a\r\nreturn to war.\r\nLuxembourg is concerned by the check to the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East that has followed the change\r\nof Government in Israel. We take the view that there is\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nno alternative to this complex and fragile process: the fruit\r\nof arduous negotiations. We urge our friends in Israel to\r\npursue this process, to comply with and execute the\r\ncommitments undertaken pursuant to the Oslo agreements\r\nand to avoid creating fresh obstacles. We fear that any\r\nother policy may generate further tension and once again\r\ntrigger a spiral of violence that would inflict suffering on\r\nall the peoples of the region. The alarming events that took\r\nplace on the West Bank today threaten to destroy the results\r\nof several years of effort to achieve a just and lasting peace\r\nin the Middle East.\r\nThe Luxembourg Government condemns the recent\r\nattacks launched by the Government of Saddam Hussein on\r\nthe Kurdish population of northern Iraq. It was inevitable\r\nthat measures would be taken to react to this fresh\r\noffensive. We call for a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces\r\nand for full respect for the territorial integrity of Iraq. We\r\nhope that the implementation of the “oil-for-food”\r\nresolution may take place without delay in order to relieve\r\nthe hardships suffered by the civilian population of that\r\ncountry.\r\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa, in\r\nparticular in Burundi, continues to give us the greatest\r\ncause for concern. I fully support the efforts of the United\r\nNations, in close cooperation with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, to avert both the occurrence in Burundi of\r\na tragedy such as occurred in Rwanda and a deterioration\r\nof the situation which could plunge the region into war.\r\nMr. Salifou (Niger), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nOver the last year, the United Nations has substantially\r\ncut the number of its peace-keeping operations. This\r\nreduction in our activities and the set-backs that we have\r\nwitnessed in the past should not, however, diminish our\r\nefforts to enhance the United Nations capacity to avert,\r\nprevent the spread of and halt conflicts, and to save human\r\nlives.\r\nIt is utterly unfair to criticize the United Nations\r\nwhenever a peace-keeping operation runs into difficulties.\r\nMany of the shortcomings attributed to the United Nations\r\ncould be resolved if all Member States undertook to pay\r\ntheir contributions to our Organization and, especially,\r\nmake available to it the resources that it needs. For this\r\nreason, Luxembourg supports the ongoing work and\r\nreflection aimed at equipping the Organization with a rapid-\r\nintervention force that would enable it to react to crises in\r\na timely fashion. Where non-military means have failed, it\r\nshould be possible to deploy well-trained and properly\r\nequipped peace-keeping contingents in the field very\r\npromptly in order to give practical effect to the Security\r\nCouncil’s decisions.\r\nGreater responsibility should henceforth be given to\r\nregional organizations. The Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is nowadays playing a\r\nleading role in conflict management in Europe and the\r\nCaucasus. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) in the former Yugoslavia and the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) in the Great Lakes region are\r\ndoing the same. Other regional and subregional\r\norganizations in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere are\r\nperforming similar tasks with the support of the United\r\nNations.\r\nInternational security begins with the security of the\r\nindividual, with respect for his fundamental rights and his\r\nprotection against any violation of those rights, including\r\nthe actions of his own Government. Nothing, therefore,\r\ncan justify violations of human rights, which by their very\r\nnature have universal value. Our Organization plays an\r\nimportant role in developing international machinery\r\ndesigned to provide effective protection for human rights.\r\nThis role takes the form, among others, of the efforts to\r\ncarry out systematic investigations and enquiries with a\r\nview to sanctioning those responsible for violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights.\r\nLuxembourg supports the early creation of an\r\ninternational criminal court, which would be a decisive\r\nstep forward in ensuring respect for the principles of\r\ninternational law.\r\nAmong the most vulnerable human beings are our\r\nchildren, and they therefore deserve special protection.\r\nThe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild marks a major advance. Scrupulously applied, that\r\nConvention will be an invaluable instrument in\r\nsafeguarding children against physical and psychological\r\nviolence. In 1995 my Government proposed to the United\r\nNations a similar, indeed, a complementary initiative, to\r\neliminate the exploitation of child labour. I welcome this\r\nAssembly adoption of that proposal designed to come to\r\nthe aid of the tens of millions of children forced to work\r\nfrom an early age. This effort should be strengthened and\r\nfurther pursued. Luxembourg also hails the results of the\r\nStockholm World Congress on the Commercial Sexual\r\nExploitation of Children. My Government is resolved to\r\nfoster international cooperation in the prevention and\r\nsuppression of sexual exploitation of children in order to\r\neffectively protect and safeguard children at the\r\ninternational level against such criminal practices.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nThe globalization of the world economy is bringing\r\nabout profound changes in international relations. A\r\nveritable revolution in information and communication\r\ntechnologies reducing geographic distances to nothing has\r\nled to a speeding up of business transactions and financial\r\nflows, as well as increased integration of markets.\r\nGenerally accepted ideas have been turned upside down,\r\nand serious questions have been raised even among\r\nindustrialized countries, where unemployment has grown to\r\nalarming proportions.\r\nAt the same time, we note that a significant number of\r\ndeveloping countries remain on the sidelines of\r\ndevelopment and remain in great poverty. At a time when\r\nour Organization proclaimed 1996 International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty, more than 1.5 billion human beings\r\ncontinue to live in a state of absolute poverty. We cannot\r\nremain indifferent to this situation. What should particularly\r\ndisturb us is the inequality gap, which is widening both\r\nwithin countries and between the countries of the North and\r\nthe South. This is a dangerous source of new tensions and\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme’s latest\r\nreport on human development speaks of worldwide social\r\nfragmentation. It underscores the widening disparities\r\nbetween rich and poor States and increased imbalances in\r\nsocieties between inhabitants of the same country. The\r\npopulation explosion and uneven access to the fruits of\r\ntechnological progress further compound these distortions.\r\nThis trend is likely to trigger increasingly massive\r\nmigrations within countries and from poor countries to\r\nricher ones.\r\nIn order to remedy this situation, I propose to develop\r\na new strategy based on four main courses of action. First,\r\nwe should provide follow-up to, and translate into\r\noperational activities, the results of the major conferences\r\nheld since the beginning of this decade in Rio, Vienna,\r\nCairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and, most recently, in Istanbul.\r\nThe World Food Summit scheduled by the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for\r\nNovember and the special session on sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the spring of 1997 are also opportunities to\r\ndefine an integrated programme of action to foster human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSecondly, we must halt the persistent decline of funds\r\nmade available for development, a symptom of “donor\r\nfatigue”. In each of our countries we must launch a new\r\nmovement of solidarity to benefit the poorest and least\r\ndeveloped countries. The Government of Luxembourg has\r\ndecided to increase year by year its contribution to\r\ncooperation for development. Our intention is to achieve\r\nthe target of devoting 0.7 per cent of our gross national\r\nproduct to official development assistance before the end\r\nof this decade. A significant portion of these funds will\r\nbe made available to the various funds and programmes\r\nof the United Nations system. This is not simply a\r\nquestion of solidarity and social justice on a world scale;\r\nit is, above all, a preventive policy designed to contribute,\r\nhowever modestly, to peace by encouraging development.\r\nThe third main course of action is to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations capacity to act in the economic and social\r\nfield. That strengthening requires courageous reforms of\r\nits structures. Above and beyond the proposals of the\r\nSummit of major industrialized countries at Lyon, which\r\nI welcome, I advocate a single rigorous coordination\r\nstructure for all economic and social activities and,\r\nespecially, a concerted restructuring of the bodies and\r\nmandates concerned. In this context, I note with interest,\r\nthe proposal of the XX Congress of the Socialist\r\nInternational, which took place recently in this very\r\nbuilding, calling for the setting up of integrated economic\r\ninstitutions on the regional and international levels and for\r\nthe setting up of a United Nations economic security\r\ncouncil.\r\nFourthly, we must develop cooperation with the\r\nrepresentatives of organized civil society, which is to say,\r\nthe non-governmental organizations.The participation of\r\nnon-governmental organizations in international\r\norganizations reinforces, in a sense, the political\r\nlegitimacy of those international bodies. The\r\nrepresentatives of civil society nowadays play a key role\r\nin the activities of the United Nations system, whether in\r\nthe promotion of human rights and democracy, in\r\nhumanitarian assistance or in cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. They make an invaluable contribution not\r\nonly to the Organization’s operational activities but also\r\nto its thinking processes, as attested to by the significant\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations in the\r\npreparation, holding and follow-up of the major world\r\nconferences organized by the United Nations.\r\nThis new dimension of our work was also\r\nhighlighted at the congress of the World Federation of\r\nUnited Nations Associations, whose fiftieth-anniversary\r\nmeeting, I am proud to note, was held in Luxembourg a\r\nlittle over a month ago.\r\nThe financial situation of our Organization continues\r\nto be a matter of grave concern. As of July, the United\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nNations cash flow was exhausted, and this situation can\r\nonly worsen between now and the end of the year.\r\nAny attempt at a radical reform of the system will be\r\nfutile if we continue to neglect the fundamental need to put\r\nit on an adequate and reliable financial footing. The United\r\nNations cannot discharge its important responsibilities\r\neffectively if it is reduced to constant worry about making\r\nends meet.\r\nAdmittedly, the Organization could do even more to\r\ncontrol its expenditure and enhance its effectiveness.\r\nGreater attention should be given, inter alia, to the question\r\nof establishing each State’s assessed contribution, which\r\nshould be based on objective criteria and reflect each\r\ncountry’s real ability to pay. However, the crisis will be\r\novercome only if each Member State fulfils its obligations\r\nby making full, timely and unconditional payment of its\r\nfinancial contribution. I therefore unreservedly support the\r\nproposals made by the European Union in this regard.\r\nIn the ongoing reform process, one aspect is of\r\nparticular significance. Within our Organization, the\r\nSecurity Council bears unique responsibilities as the organ\r\nentrusted with preventing and resolving conflicts.One of the\r\ngreatest lessons to be learnt from the experiences and\r\nsetbacks of recent years is that Security Council members\r\nmust, if they wish to preserve its credibility, demonstrate\r\ntheir determination to enforce their decisions, once taken.\r\nThe credibility and effectiveness of the Council with\r\nregard to peace-keeping and international security will be\r\nreinforced by the establishment of more open, transparent\r\nand collegial decision-making processes while maintaining\r\nclose consultation with the countries supplying matériel and\r\ncontingents. The not-insignificant progress made in this\r\nrespect in the recent past should be integrated into the\r\nsystem.\r\nIn addition, the Council’s legitimacy, and probably the\r\nquality of its decisions, would also benefit from a\r\nreadjustment in membership. The enlargement of the\r\nCouncil should take into account the ability of member\r\nStates to contribute to peace-keeping and to the\r\nachievement of the Organization’s goals. A better balance\r\nmust be struck between industrialized and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe passing of the bipolar world has freed our planet\r\nfrom the ideological, political and military fetters that\r\nimpeded to an extraordinary degree our capacity to act.\r\nRelieved of the threat of global confrontation and nuclear\r\nholocaust, we are now faced with a series of worldwide\r\nproblems, old and new, that includes underdevelopment,\r\nenvironmental degradation, the proliferation of all kinds\r\nof weapons, terrorism, ethnic conflicts, drug trafficking,\r\nviolence and crime in all its guises.\r\nLuxembourg is convinced that the solution to those\r\nproblems lies not in isolationism, nor in nationalism, nor\r\nin fundamentalism of any description. We would also be\r\ndeluding ourselves were we to put our trust solely in the\r\nmarket and private initiative to remedy all humanity’s ills.\r\nOnly through an approach based on cooperation,\r\nsolidarity, tolerance and mutual esteem can we tackle\r\nthose problems successfully at both the regional and the\r\nworld levels.\r\nThis has been the approach of the European Union\r\nand its member States, which have succeeded in attaining,\r\nin Europe, a level of stability and prosperity hitherto\r\nunknown. The approach is based on the concept of\r\ndemocracy and of a market economy that is not\r\nuncontrolled but socially responsible, one in which the\r\nState fully shoulders its responsibilities in the areas of\r\nhealth, education and social justice. The system requires\r\nconstant adjustments, but its principles and bases are not\r\nsubject to debate. Other parts of the world have also\r\nsuccessfully entered into a process of cooperation and\r\nregional integration.\r\nOn the world level, the United Nations is the only\r\ntruly universal Organization. We must work at this level\r\nto make a contribution vital to the solution of global\r\nproblems, one that will complement the efforts being\r\nmade at the regional level.\r\nThat is the new and important responsibility that\r\nbecame evident in the course of the events and meetings\r\nthat occurred the world over in commemorating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year. There\r\nwas emphasis on the need to set up new structures and to\r\nreform the United Nations, to give it the requisite capacity\r\nfor review, action and cooperation.\r\nIt is our hope that, with a heightened awareness of\r\nthe interests of all mankind we, the representatives of the\r\nStates Members of the United Nations, will succeed in\r\ndisplaying the vision, courage and political resolve needed\r\nto make our Organization an effective instrument capable\r\nof facing the challenges of the third millennium.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South\r\nAfrica, His Excellency Mr. Alfred B. Nzo.\r\nMr. Nzo (South Africa): I should like first to extend\r\nwarm congratulations to Mr. Razali Ismail on his election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession. We have no doubt that the session will benefit\r\nfrom his known skills as he discharges his responsibilities.\r\nI should also like to commend Mr. Diogo Freitas\r\ndo Amaral for the excellent work done during his term of\r\noffice.\r\nI should also like to express to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our continued confidence in his\r\nguidance of the Organization.\r\nAllow me at the outset of this, my first opportunity to\r\nspeak before the General Assembly, to express the deep\r\ngratitude and appreciation of the people and Government of\r\nSouth Africa for the decision taken by the Assembly at the\r\nfiftieth session to relieve the new democratic Government\r\nof South Africa of the burden of the contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations budget accumulated over the period of two\r\ndecades when the apartheid regime was excluded from\r\nparticipating in the work of the General Assembly. We\r\nrecognize that that action involved considerable sacrifice,\r\nboth for the United Nations and for its Member States, and\r\nthat it was also consistent with the historic commitment of\r\nsupport for our struggle for democracy.\r\nSouth Africa remains committed to achieving a world\r\nfree of all weapons of mass destruction and to addressing\r\nthe issue of the proliferation of conventional weapons. We\r\ntherefore welcome the adoption of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which we signed\r\nyesterday.\r\nOur support for the CTBT as an instrument of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation is based upon the view\r\nthat this Treaty is an integral part of a process which will\r\nlead to the full implementation of the nuclear-disarmament\r\nobligations set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nAn important milestone along this road was the\r\nadoption of the Pelindaba Treaty creating the African\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. This Treaty will contribute\r\ngreatly to measures aimed at achieving a world free from\r\nnuclear weapons. Further steps are needed in the process to\r\nbring the world closer to the ultimate goal of the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. The next step is for\r\nAfrican States to cooperate with parties to the other\r\nnuclear-weapon-free-zones in the Pacific and Latin\r\nAmerican regions with a view to promoting a southern\r\nhemisphere-wide nuclear-weapon-free zone. We are\r\nheartened by the unprecedented step of four nuclear-\r\nweapon States’ signing the relevant Protocols of the\r\nPelindaba Treaty simultaneously with African States in\r\nApril 1996, while the fifth has indicated that it will sign\r\nshortly. South Africa, as stated previously in other\r\nforums, will also work for the commencement next year\r\nof negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a\r\ntreaty banning the production of fissile material for\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nSouth Africa also supports and will work for the\r\nestablishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear\r\ndisarmament in the Conference on Disarmament. This\r\ncommittee can identify and negotiate the necessary steps\r\nby which we can achieve the ultimate goal of the eventual\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. We also look forward to\r\nthe early ratification of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention by those States that have not yet done so.\r\nIt is not just the threat posed by all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and their means of delivery that is of serious\r\nconcern to my Government, but also the build-up of\r\nconventional weapons beyond a level which can be\r\nconsidered legitimate for the purposes of self-defence.\r\nConventional weapons are, in fact, the cause of most of\r\nthe deaths and suffering of millions of people in conflicts\r\naround the world today.\r\nMy Government would therefore like to encourage\r\nall States Members of the United Nations to support and\r\nparticipate in the United Nations Register of Conventional\r\nArms, and lend active support to General Assembly\r\nresolution 50/70 B on small arms and its panel of\r\ngovernmental experts mandated to assist the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to prepare a report on small arms. We would also\r\nencourage Member States to support the worldwide\r\nefforts to secure the elimination of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. In order to alleviate the suffering caused by\r\nlandmines, my Government is committed to reinforcing\r\ninternational cooperation. As a country with advanced\r\ndemining technology, we are pleased to be making a\r\nmodest contribution to international efforts to unearth\r\nlandmines.\r\nSouth Africa will continue to cooperate in the\r\nvarious international forums dedicated to the\r\nnon-proliferation of the technologies and equipment which\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\ncould be used in the development of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, and in discouraging any destabilizing build up\r\nof conventional weapons.\r\nOur harrowing experience under the tyranny of\r\napartheid has imposed a duty on us to place a high\r\npremium on the promotion of human rights. In this regard,\r\nour Constitution contains an entrenched and fully justiciable\r\nBill of Rights. In addition, plans are advanced for the\r\nestablishment of an office on the status of women to\r\nprovide a mechanism within the Government to act as a\r\nmonitor to ensure that a gender perspective is integrated\r\ninto all publicly-funded policies and programmes. The\r\nSouth African Government regards it as a priority to\r\ncontribute to the efforts of the international community to\r\ncombat the violation of human rights.\r\nIn South Africa, and in the region as a whole,\r\nprocesses of democratization have released a host of\r\nproductive human and political resources. This has, in many\r\nways, contributed to the achievement of peace, security and\r\nstability in our region.\r\nOur vision for southern Africa is one of the highest\r\npossible degree of economic cooperation, mutual assistance\r\nand the joint planning of regional development initiatives,\r\nleading to full economic integration.\r\nCivil conflicts have ravaged many parts of Africa. We\r\nwelcome the positive developments which have taken place\r\nin Rwanda and Sierra Leone. However, serious conflict\r\npersists in Liberia, Burundi and Somalia. The South African\r\nGovernment is committed to playing an active role in the\r\nongoing efforts of the international community to assist the\r\npeople of Burundi to bring about lasting peace and national\r\nreconciliation. President Mandela recently appointed a\r\nspecial representative for Burundi, who has been given the\r\ntask of searching for a viable solution in close coordination\r\nwith other special representatives and with countries in the\r\nregion. These efforts need to be supplemented by close\r\ncooperation between the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and the United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, we are heartened by the progress,\r\nalbeit tentative so far, towards peace in Angola.\r\nRepresentatives of Member countries assembled here will\r\nagree that the people of Angola deserve peace at last as an\r\ninstrument for — or rather, as an important ingredient of —\r\nembarking on the road to sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment and social advancement. Our Government\r\ncommends the efforts of the United Nations, and especially\r\nthose of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General\r\nfor Angola, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, who has with\r\ntremendous patience and commitment guided the Angolan\r\npeace process to the stage where it is today. We owe it to\r\nthe people of Angola to see this process through to its\r\nlogical conclusion.\r\nThrough the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution, member States of the OAU are collectively\r\ncommitted to restoring peace and security on our\r\ncontinent. In support of the OAU mechanism, we are\r\npleased that the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity has recently created an organ on politics,\r\ndefence and security. These efforts reflect Africa’s\r\nprimary concern with issues of preventive diplomacy and\r\nconflict resolution.\r\nSouth Africa welcomed the spirit of dialogue and\r\nrealism that had begun to characterize the relations\r\nbetween Israel and Palestine and was hopeful that this\r\npositive development would gradually replace the\r\ncenturies of conflict in the Middle East. That hope was\r\nfurther reinforced by the Declaration of Principles on\r\nInterim Self-Government Arrangements reached in Oslo.\r\nMy Government is concerned, however, that recent\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East are likely to reverse and\r\njeopardize the peace process. We therefore urge all the\r\nplayers in the Middle East to rise to the occasion and, in\r\na spirit of reconciliation, to move steadfastly towards a\r\nlasting peace in the region.\r\nWe are seriously concerned by the marginalization,\r\nparticularly of African countries among the least-\r\ndeveloped countries, from the process of globalization and\r\nliberalization. In this regard, closer attention should be\r\ngiven to the need to address the external debt burden of\r\nthe least-developed countries, especially those in Africa.\r\nProblems associated with the debt burden and its\r\nservicing still persist and frustrate the rate at which the\r\ncontinent can extricate itself from the vicious cycle of\r\npoverty.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Mid-term Review of the\r\nImplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and recognize the\r\nimportance of the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative on Africa, as well as the need to underpin its\r\nsuccess through appropriate and adequate resources.\r\nIn this context we also welcome the designation of\r\n1996 as the International Year for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty. We hope that the international community will\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nrealize this objective in clear recognition of the challenges\r\nfacing it.\r\nWe welcome the World Food Summit, which is to\r\nconvene in Rome in November 1996 and which will afford\r\nthe international community the opportunity to demonstrate\r\nits commitment to ensuring that poverty eradication\r\nstrategies are fully integrated into all initiatives of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nMy Government is encouraged by the outcome of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements\r\n(HABITAT II). The results of the Conference represent the\r\ncollaborative efforts of the international community to\r\ndevelop a consensus view on the fundamental need to\r\nprovide access to adequate shelter and infrastructure for all\r\npeople. Continued support for initiatives at the national and\r\ninternational level to realize and implement the necessary\r\nfollow-up to HABITAT II should now receive priority\r\nattention.\r\nIt was an honour for South Africa to host the ninth\r\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) in April 1996. My Government\r\nbelieves that the sound basis for cooperation established by\r\nUNCTAD IX and the call for partnership for growth and\r\ndevelopment outlined in the Midrand Declaration must be\r\ncarried forward and implemented through the General\r\nAssembly and other forums. South Africa is particularly\r\nkeen to ensure that the framework which we adopted at\r\nMidrand for the reform of UNCTAD is translated into an\r\neffective facility for the developing world.\r\nSouth Africa also wishes to underscore the\r\nfundamental importance of international cooperation in the\r\nenvironmental and development fields. Sustained political\r\ncommitment through global partnership remains essential\r\nfor our continuing international cooperation efforts. It is for\r\nthis reason that we believe that the 1997 special session of\r\nthe General Assembly will provide an excellent opportunity\r\nto reaffirm the principles and objectives of the Rio\r\nDeclaration’s Agenda 21.\r\nSouth Africa, a country with a long coastline, has\r\nconsiderable interest in matters relating to the law of the\r\nsea. We are thus pleased that the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and its implementing\r\nAgreement have entered into force, and that the\r\nInternational Sea-Bed Authority and related structures, of\r\nwhich South Africa is proud to be a member, have been\r\nestablished.\r\nIn my statement to the General Assembly during the\r\nfiftieth session, I expressed the sincere hope that\r\nsignificant progress would be made in bringing about the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court. It is\r\ntherefore gratifying to see that the Preparatory Committee\r\non the Establishment of an International Criminal Court,\r\nwhich was established during the fiftieth session, has\r\nmade much progress in bringing this idea to fruition.\r\nWhat is now needed is to take this process forward by\r\nholding as soon as possible a diplomatic conference\r\nwhere the statute of the proposed court can be finalized.\r\nIt is widely acknowledged that the favourable\r\nchanges in the international climate are conducive to the\r\nreform and modernization of the United Nations in order\r\nto prepare the Organization to respond effectively to the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nI wish to recall that in his address on 23 October\r\n1995 at the Special Commemorative Meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, President Mandela, said:\r\n“Indeed the United Nations has to reassess its\r\nrole, redefine its profile and reshape its\r\nstructures. It should truly reflect the diversity\r\nof our universe and ensure equity among the\r\nnations in the exercise of power within the\r\nsystem of international relations in general, and\r\nthe Security Council in particular.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 37th meeting, p. 6)\r\nIn this regard, my delegation wishes to register its\r\ndisappointment at the slow pace of advancement, with no\r\nend in sight to the deliberations of the Working Group on\r\nthe question of equitable representation and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and other matters\r\nrelating to the Security Council. In this regard we support\r\nthe recommendation in the report of the Working Group\r\nthat the Group should continue with its work. We would\r\nalso urge Member States to demonstrate flexibility and\r\naccommodation in their future deliberations and to display\r\nthe necessary political will in order to reach a common\r\nunderstanding.\r\nIn the declaration that the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations on 24 October 1995, it\r\nwas noted that\r\n“In order to carry out its work effectively, the\r\nUnited Nations must have adequate resources.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nMember States must meet, in full and on time, their\r\nobligation to bear the expenses of the Organization, as\r\napportioned by the General Assembly. That\r\napportionment should be established on the basis of\r\ncriteria agreed to and considered to be fair by Member\r\nStates.” (A/50/48, para. 15)\r\nMy delegation has taken note of the progress of the\r\nWorking Group on the financial situation in highlighting the\r\nproblems facing the Organization, and urges all Member\r\nStates to pay what is legally due as soon as possible in\r\norder that we may direct our energies to the real problems\r\nfacing the world at this time. As we approach the twenty-\r\nfirst century, let us together resolve to redefine the role and\r\nshape of the United Nations and render this institution\r\nbetter equipped to carry out the important task of advancing\r\npeace and development in the world.\r\nAddress by Mr. Basdeo Panday, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Assembly will now hear a statement by the Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nMr. Basdeo Panday, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, His Excellency\r\nMr. Basdeo Panday, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Panday (Trinidad and Tobago): It is a great\r\nhonour for me to extend to Mr. Razali Ismail our warmest\r\ncongratulations, on behalf of the delegation of Trinidad and\r\nTobago, on his election as President of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAs the United Nations begins the second half-century\r\nof its existence, and as the international community seeks\r\nto renew and reshape the Organization to deal with the\r\nchallenges of the approaching millennium, the Trinidad and\r\nTobago delegation is particularly pleased to see the\r\nstewardship of the General Assembly in the hands of a\r\nleader and a friend of Mr. Razali’s calibre.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its deep\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo\r\nFreitas do Amaral of Portugal, for the able manner in which\r\nhe presided over the historic fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nToday more than ever, we live in a global age, an\r\nage of immeasurable possibilities and opportunities\r\nengendered by advances in technology, the information\r\nrevolution and globalization; but it is also an age full of\r\nperil, one characterized by complex and myriad\r\nchallenges, many of which we have yet to understand\r\nfully or come to terms with.\r\nIn this age of globalization and fragmentation,\r\ntraditional national and international structures are\r\nbecoming increasingly inadequate to deal with current\r\nrealities. Nation States are also more frequently\r\nconfronting the need to find acceptable means by which\r\nto yield elements of their sovereignty through regional\r\nand multilateral action, in order to deal effectively with\r\nglobal forces that are invariably transnational in nature.\r\nIn this sea of change in international relations, the\r\nwhole concept of international security has increasingly\r\nmoved away from the bipolar view, concerned largely\r\nwith military security, to one which assigns a central role\r\nto sustainable development and the welfare of the\r\nindividual. The major actors in the international arena are\r\nno longer solely nation States, but also economic agents\r\nwith a global reach and non-governmental organizations\r\nwith a growing global influence.\r\nYet these powerful forces that are inexorably pulling\r\nus together are also simultaneously tearing us apart,\r\nengendering fragmentation, reactivating age-old conflicts,\r\nand threatening more than ever to marginalize and leave\r\nbehind large segments of humanity in the march to\r\nprogress. Among some of the more powerful and\r\nindustrialized countries, the fears of active integration and\r\nengagement are leading to temptations to look inward and\r\nto become more isolationist and more protectionist. In\r\naddition, the problems of persistent poverty, increasing\r\nunemployment, debilitating debt, declining levels of\r\nofficial development assistance, environmental\r\ndegradation, drug abuse and drug trafficking, crime,\r\nterrorism and social disintegration have combined to\r\npresent a formidable array of challenges, which, if left\r\nunaddressed, threaten to overwhelm us and further\r\nmarginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us.\r\nIn this new global environment, we are at a critical\r\ncrossroads, and in many ways the decisions that confront\r\nus in the international community on the eve of the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\ntwenty-first century are no less important than those that\r\nconfronted us at the end of the war to end all wars.\r\nIn this evolving global society, the choices are clear.\r\nWill we allow the world to drift towards the dangerous\r\nanarchy of spheres of influence and unchecked\r\nconfrontation? Or will we commit ourselves to greater\r\ncooperation inherent in the call to global neighbourhood\r\naction? Will we allow ethnic conflicts and “ethnic\r\ncleansing” to continue? Or will we resolutely resist the\r\nprimitive impulses by devising mechanisms to avoid\r\nrepetitions of these phenomena, wherever they occur?\r\nWill we grasp the new opportunity for global\r\nprosperity, or will we allow the common global enemies to\r\noverwhelm us? Will we help to alleviate the crisis in\r\nmultilateralism and give to the world of the twenty-first\r\ncentury a reformed United Nations, true to the ideals of the\r\nfounding fathers, or will we increasingly move in the\r\ndirection of unilateralism, seeking to use the United Nations\r\nfor narrow self-interest? Finally, will we give to the world\r\na new global order, true to the letter and spirit of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary Declaration, and based on the\r\nsustainable development agenda of the recent global\r\nconferences, or will we build a world of two societies, one\r\ngetting progressively richer and the other progressively\r\npoorer?\r\nWe must not be afraid of challenges. Trinidad and\r\nTobago, as a small developing island State, with all the\r\nconcomitant vulnerability and fragility, has embarked on an\r\naggressive, outward-oriented strategy of development. This\r\nstrategy has been informed by the need to optimize our\r\nability to participate in a global economy that is becoming\r\nincreasingly knowledge-based, fiercely competitive and\r\nvolatile. Our development strategy has as its basic objective\r\nthe attainment of broad-based economic growth with social\r\nequity. It assigns a special emphasis to trade, investment,\r\ntourism, agriculture, services and the environment, and it\r\nseeks, through a political process of inclusiveness and\r\nempowerment, to mobilize all of our human resources in\r\nthe task of building a sustainable democracy.\r\nIn November 1995, the new Government of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, which I have the honour to lead, assumed\r\noffice through the medium of the ballot box. The peaceful\r\nand democratic transfer of power that took place at that\r\ntime was further ample testimony to the political maturity\r\nof our peoples, and the political stability that we in\r\nTrinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean have been fortunate\r\nto enjoy.\r\nIn any democracy, however, one must be eternally\r\nvigilant, constantly striving to enhance the democratic\r\ntradition and strengthen the democratic process. It is in\r\nthis context that I have sought to establish a Government\r\nof National Unity, committed to partnership-building at all\r\nlevels. Special emphasis has been placed on the\r\ndevolution of power from central to local government\r\nauthorities, so as to facilitate greater participation in the\r\ndemocratic process. A National Multipartite Commission,\r\ncomprising representatives of labour, business,\r\nGovernment, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nInter-Religious Organization, has been established and\r\nentrusted with the task of formulating a comprehensive\r\nplan of action to take us into the twenty-first century. The\r\naim of these and other measures is to build a truly\r\nparticipatory society, empowering all of our peoples.\r\nIn the social arena, we have sought to create a viable\r\nsocial pact among business, labour and Government, built\r\non consultation, partnership and consensus, so as to\r\nprovide stability, trust and transparency in industrial\r\nrelations. We have also sought, through our social\r\nprogrammes, to place special emphasis on the\r\ndisadvantaged and dispossessed, with a view to providing\r\nthem with the necessary support, training and skills for\r\neffective participation in our society. In this regard, a\r\nChange Management Unit for Poverty Eradication and\r\nEquity Building has been established under the authority\r\nof a senior Cabinet Minister. The unit is entrusted with\r\nthe responsibility of formulating an integrated, multi-\r\nsectoral and sustained approach to poverty eradication,\r\nand ensuring its implementation in all facets of the\r\nGovernment’s economic and social policies. As a\r\ncomplement to this Unit, the Government of Trinidad and\r\nTobago will, on 24 October 1996 — United Nations\r\nDay — set up a National Social Development Council to\r\nmobilize national action to deal with the homeless and the\r\npoor. This innovative approach to poverty eradication is\r\nbeing implemented in close cooperation with the United\r\nNations Development Programme, which has provided\r\ntimely support in this, the International Year for the\r\nEradication of Poverty. In keeping with the spirit of\r\nBeijing and the Platform for Action of the Beijing\r\nConference, a vigorous policy and legislative agenda is\r\nbeing formulated and implemented through a consultative\r\nprocess, the objective being to optimize the role of\r\nwomen as equal partners in the development process.\r\nWith regard to the environment, a comprehensive\r\nlegislative and policy framework has been put in place to\r\nrespond to the demands of sustainable development. This\r\nnew environmental regime will serve to ensure a\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\n“greening” of the Government’s own operations, while\r\nsimultaneously engaging the public and industry in a\r\npartnership for responsible management, protection and\r\nconservation of the environment.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago’s economic programme places a\r\npremium on trade, with the private sector as the engine of\r\ngrowth in the economy. Some of the essential elements of\r\nthe strategy are the attraction of private investment flows,\r\ncreation of increased market access, and the implementation\r\nof an appropriate industrial policy. This is being achieved\r\nthrough the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic\r\npolicy, supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and\r\nmonetary stance, and the delivery of an investor-friendly\r\ninstitutional legal framework.\r\nWe in Trinidad and Tobago are under no illusions. All\r\nof our national efforts will be in vain if we do not have a\r\nsupportive regional and international environment, as well\r\nas access to a fair, open and non-discriminatory\r\ninternational trading regime. Regional integration has\r\nalways been a fundamental component of the development\r\nstrategy of Trinidad and Tobago. Accordingly, our Republic\r\nhas built strategic alliances through the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, the Rio Group and, more recently, the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States, comprising countries of\r\nthe wider Caribbean. We continue to be engaged actively\r\nin efforts to deepen and broaden the integration process\r\nwithin the region through initiatives that we hope will\r\nculminate in formal relationships with the Central American\r\nCommon Market, the Andean Pact and the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR). Our vision for the future\r\nis a single free-trade area in the western hemisphere.\r\nFor small States like Trinidad and Tobago, greater\r\nregional integration and cooperation are imperative if we\r\nare to minimize the negative and pervasive effects of\r\nglobalization, while simultaneously laying the foundations\r\nfor our increased capacity to navigate the turbulent waters\r\nof the expanding global economy.\r\nRegionalism is a critical priority, but in today’s world\r\nit must be conceived as a natural and essential complement\r\nto wider international cooperation. The common evils of the\r\ntwenty-first century will require a common approach, a\r\ncommon commitment. I can think of no other organization\r\nmore uniquely placed or more legitimate than the United\r\nNations to foster the global conscience, to fashion the\r\nnecessary understanding, to build the mutual partnerships,\r\nand to organize the global cooperative effort.\r\nIn the field of sustainable development, the\r\ncontinuum of global conferences, from Rio to Istanbul,\r\nhave laid down a global agenda, a development blueprint\r\nfor the twenty-first century. Yet as discussions on the\r\nAgenda for Development have shown, there is a crisis of\r\ncommitment, particularly on the part of the developed\r\ncountries, to provide the required resources. “Donor\r\nfatigue” and declining levels of official development\r\nassistance threaten to render meaningless the global\r\nunderstanding, consensus and Programmes of Action\r\nforged in respect of the major issues and problems of our\r\ntimes.\r\nThis negative mood imperils all of us, for it\r\nthreatens to subject some one fifth of the world’s\r\npopulation, who live in poverty, to a life of perpetual\r\ndespair. But more than that, it ignores the fact that the\r\ngap between the haves and the have-nots continues to\r\ngrow alongside the growth in world trade. It forgets the\r\nmessage inherent in the common problems of our time:\r\nthat whether we like it or not, our progress, and\r\nincreasingly our security, is tied to that of our neighbours,\r\nno matter how poor or how distant they may be. Finally,\r\nit ignores the generally acknowledged fact that preventive\r\naction to deal with the root causes of conflict is less\r\ncostly and more effective than corrective action.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago also attaches the highest\r\npriority to the fight against drug abuse and drug\r\ntrafficking. We have intensified our coordination activities\r\nat the national level, and have systematically put in place\r\ncooperative mechanisms with other Caribbean and Latin\r\nAmerican countries, as well as with other States whose\r\ninvolvement is critical to the success of national and\r\nregional efforts. We believe that the violence, the\r\ncorruption and the human despair which this menace\r\nwreaks on societies in all corners of the globe, should\r\nleave no doubt as to the imperative need for the United\r\nNations to accord priority attention to this question.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is therefore fully supportive of the\r\ncall for the convening in 1997 of an international\r\nconference on this subject. My delegation wishes to\r\ncommend in particular the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme for its important contribution to\r\nthe multi-dimensional campaign against drug abuse and\r\nillicit drug trafficking being waged within our Republic\r\nand in the wider Caribbean and Latin American region.\r\nWe urge the Drug Control Programme to continue to\r\npursue a comprehensive and balanced approach to this\r\nworldwide campaign, endeavouring to address equitably\r\nthe problems of demand, production and trafficking.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nIn the field of international law, we have over the past\r\ndecades seen a number of new agreements in virtually all\r\nbranches of human activity. Trinidad and Tobago is\r\nencouraged by the progress made during the fiftieth session\r\nof the General Assembly towards the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court. We look forward to a positive\r\nrecommendation for the completion of work during the\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly in order to\r\nrealize the goal of a diplomatic conference in 1998 to adopt\r\nthe statute and establish the court. We in the international\r\ncommunity have the responsibility to create this global\r\ninstitution with the requisite global jurisdiction, and to\r\nequip it with the necessary authority to make it an effective,\r\nimpartial body, with the broadest possible participation of\r\nStates from all geographical regions. Meanwhile, Trinidad\r\nand Tobago fully supports the activities of the International\r\nTribunals for the territories of the former Yugoslavia and\r\nof Rwanda.\r\nIn the field of nuclear disarmament, the international\r\ncommunity last year indefinitely extended the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and, earlier this\r\nmonth, the General Assembly adopted the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. These two developments have\r\nserved to promote non-proliferation and nuclear\r\ndisarmament. The international community must now,\r\nhowever, focus its attention on the emerging consensus that\r\nall nuclear explosions must be banned.\r\nA related environmental concern to which Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, the Caribbean and the Alliance of Small Island\r\nNations attach the greatest importance is that of the\r\ncontinued shipments of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium\r\nand high-level radioactive wastes. At last year’s Review\r\nConference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Trinidad and\r\nTobago and the Alliance of Small Island Nations was able,\r\nafter long and intensive negotiations, to obtain agreement\r\non specific language registering the concerns of small\r\nisland developing States and other coastal States on this\r\nissue.\r\nThe considerations which led us to pursue that\r\ninitiative then are still relevant now. These shipments\r\ncontinue to take place despite the potentially catastrophic\r\neffects on small island developing States, whose fragile and\r\nvulnerable economies are overwhelmingly dependent on\r\ntheir marine and coastal resources, and who possess neither\r\nthe resources nor the capability to deal with possible\r\naccidents of this nature. Trinidad and Tobago would\r\ntherefore like to reiterate the priority concern we attach to\r\nthis issue, and to urge the shipment countries to respect the\r\nwishes of small island developing States and other en-route\r\nStates, which have called for an end to these shipments\r\nthrough their archipelagic and territorial waters, as well as\r\ntheir exclusive economic zones.\r\nThe notions of shared responsibilities and collective\r\naction are the raison d’être of the United Nations system.\r\nAs we prepare to face the new challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, these notions assume a critical relevance.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is convinced that the United Nations\r\nhas the capacity to reconcile these opposing forces of\r\nglobalization and fragmentation in the interests of us all.\r\nThe United Nations also has the strength and legitimacy\r\nto transform the fears and perils of the new age into a\r\nconstructive global partnership of cooperation and\r\nsolidarity. Trinidad and Tobago pledges to work with\r\nothers to harness this potential and to confront the\r\nchallenges which face the Organization and the\r\ninternational community as we move towards the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Basdeo Panday, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Trinidad and Tobago, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting.\r\nOne representative has requested to speak in exercise\r\nof the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in the\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for\r\nthe first intervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): In\r\nthe statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLuxembourg there was an erroneous reference to the\r\nsituation in my country that warrants a reply.\r\nFirst, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLuxembourg condemned what he called the latest assault\r\nby the Iraqi Government against the Kurdish population.\r\nIt seems that the Foreign Minister is not aware of, or\r\nwishes to ignore, the facts.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-first session 25 September 1996\r\nIn order to set the record straight, what occurred in\r\nnorthern Iraq is that an armed group supported by a\r\nneighbouring State attempted to establish a stronghold for\r\nthat State in our territory. Iraqi national Kurds resisted, and\r\nthey requested the assistance of the central Government.\r\nWe expelled the saboteurs and terrorists from our territory.\r\nStability has now been restored in the northern area after\r\nmore than five years of internal combat.\r\nCan the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg explain how\r\nit is possible, from the viewpoint of international law, to\r\ncondemn the movement of a State’s troops inside its own\r\nterritory in order to impose order and expel aggressors and\r\nterrorists?\r\nSecondly, the Minister from Luxembourg called for\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces and for full\r\nrespect for the territorial integrity of Iraq.” (Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fifty-first Session,\r\nPlenary Meetings, 9th meeting, p. 14)\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nWe have never heard such contradictory logic. He\r\nrequested that a country’s troops withdraw from its own\r\nterritory and respect the territorial integrity of that same\r\nState. We leave it to the intelligence of members to\r\nrealize the contradictory nature of this. If the Foreign\r\nMinister of Luxembourg is really concerned about the\r\nunity of Iraq’s territory, as he claims, he would be against\r\nforeign interference in the affairs of Iraq and against the\r\nUnited States imposition of no-fly zones in the northern\r\nand southern parts of Iraq in a manner that contradicts\r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations, as\r\nwell as the resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nFinally, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg also\r\nexpressed the hope that the formula of oil for food would\r\nswiftly be implemented. While we generally welcome this\r\ninvitation, we would hope that it would be extended\r\nspecifically to those who are delaying the implementation\r\nof the formula for election purposes, and here we mean\r\nthe United States of America.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.40 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
