(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Milan Kučan, President of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia\r\nThe President: This afternoon the Assembly will first\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia.\r\nMr. Milan Kucan, President of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Slovenia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Milan Kučan, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Kučan (spoke in Slovene; interpretation\r\nprovided by the delegation): Please allow me at the outset,\r\nSir, to express my sincere congratulations on your election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\r\nsession. The expectations of this session are great and the\r\ntasks demanding; however, your experience and political\r\nwisdom are a guarantee that they will be fulfilled.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank His\r\nExcellency for Razali Ismail, Ambassador of Malaysia, for\r\nhis energetic and successful presidency of the fifty-first\r\nsession.\r\nAlmost two years have passed since we, Heads of\r\nState and Government of the United Nations Member\r\nStates, confirmed our commitment to the idea of reform\r\nin this very Hall. This reform should contribute to the\r\naccomplishment of the mission of the United Nations in\r\nthe current international situation as well as to greater\r\nefficiency of the Organization. Today, we have before us\r\na comprehensive set of proposals by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in “Renewing the United Nations: A Programme\r\nfor Reform” (A/51/950). This document proves that the\r\ndiscussions held within the last two years, and the\r\nexperience gained in recent decades, have helped the new\r\nSecretary-General to prepare, within a few months,\r\nconcrete proposals providing a basis for further decisions.\r\nSlovenia joins those who have expressed their\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the impressive\r\nwork he has performed in the first months of his mandate.\r\nThis work has included concrete measures for the\r\nfunctioning of the Secretariat and proposals for reform.\r\nWe are well aware, however, that the responsibility now\r\nlies with us. We, the representatives of the Member States\r\nand the peoples of the United Nations, are responsible for\r\ndecisions that will give impetus to the necessary reforms\r\nand enable the Organization to deal with the tasks of the\r\ncoming century.\r\nOur approach should not be based primarily on\r\ncalculations of what individual Member States might gain\r\nfrom the reform. It should above all be based on an\r\nassessment of how to reform the Organization so that it\r\nwill better serve all of us. This will be possible only if\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nthe Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic\r\ntasks — the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nand comprehensive economic and social development,\r\nparticularly in developing countries — and to ensure broad\r\nrespect for the promotion and protection of individual and\r\ncollective human rights.\r\nAnother important requirement for the success of this\r\nreform programme is for the United Nations to take its\r\ndecisions promptly and on time. The past years have made\r\npossible all-round discussion about reform. And now is the\r\ntime for decisions: Slovenia believes that major decisions\r\nshould be taken during the first part of the present session\r\nof the General Assembly. The President of the General\r\nAssembly will play a significant role with regard to those\r\ndecisions that cannot be postponed. We fully support and\r\nencourage you, Sir, in your assumption of an active role\r\nand in your determined management of the decision-making\r\nprocess.\r\nSlovenia supports the proposals contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on a programme for reform. This\r\nproject deserves all our attention and assistance. Its main\r\nvalue is that it offers the possibility of concrete decisions\r\nwhile remaining open to new ideas and proposals.\r\nThe proposals for promoting sustainable development,\r\ndefined as a priority task by the Secretary-General himself,\r\ndeserve careful examination. The impression is that these\r\nproposals are headed in the right direction, although clearer\r\nanswers to questions on development financing will be\r\nrequired. The “development dividend” created by the\r\nstreamlining of the Secretariat will not be able to provide\r\nall the answers we need. Concrete proposals will be needed\r\nto define more accurately the tasks of the proposed office\r\nfor development financing, which would encourage\r\ninnovative means of mobilizing new financial resources for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSlovenia agrees with the suggestion of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that human rights should be integrated into all\r\nprincipal activities of the United Nations, such as peace and\r\nsecurity, economic and social affairs, development\r\ncooperation and humanitarian affairs. This approach\r\npromises a significant improvement in the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in these areas. It would also lead to\r\nincreasingly comprehensive United Nations activities in the\r\nfield of human rights.\r\nRespect for human rights is achieved not only through\r\nthe functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with\r\ninternational treaties but also through political, social and\r\neconomic measures that allow human rights to become an\r\nintegral part of social development and a part of the\r\neveryday life of each individual. Observance of human\r\nrights must be closely linked with the promotion of social\r\nprogress and the eradication of poverty in order to secure\r\nhuman dignity, essential social security and development.\r\nFurthermore, this would substantially contribute to the\r\nelimination of political tensions and of the root causes of\r\nthreats to international peace. Should the United Nations\r\nfail to ensure respect for human dignity and the protection\r\nof human rights, its basic mission will not be fulfilled.\r\nThe new High Commissioner for Human Rights will\r\ncertainly assume an important role in the search for\r\nsolutions to salient issues. We note with pleasure that it\r\nis Mrs. Mary Robinson, until recently the President of\r\nIreland, who has been appointed to this post. Mrs.\r\nRobinson has already won worldwide recognition, and we\r\nwish her every success and look forward to her proposals\r\nfor improvements in the field of human rights.\r\nReform of the Security Council constitutes an\r\nimportant part of the reform of the United Nations. The\r\nperiod following the end of the cold war only reconfirms\r\nthe importance of the effective functioning of the\r\nmechanisms of collective security. However, it also calls\r\nfor changes in the composition of the Security Council\r\nand for the improvement of its working methods.\r\nSlovenia is committed to a reasonable and balanced\r\nincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, to a restriction on the\r\nuse of the veto and to greater transparency in the\r\nfunctioning of the Council. It is our hope that the\r\ndiscussions on Security Council reform, which have been\r\ngoing on for several years now, will lead to appropriate\r\ndecisions that have the genuine support of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nSlovenia also endorses the approach taken by the\r\nSecretary-General in the field of disarmament.\r\nDisarmament has been one of the priority goals of the\r\nUnited Nations since its foundation. We have good reason\r\nto be satisfied, since disarmament efforts have registered\r\nconsiderable progress with respect to weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. The Chemical Weapons Convention, signed\r\nfour years ago, entered into force this year. We expect it\r\nto be implemented effectively, although this will be\r\nfeasible only if the Convention is ratified by all the\r\nremaining countries, particularly those disposing of large\r\nstockpiles of chemical weapons or of resources for their\r\nproduction.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the conclusion of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year have\r\nconsiderably reduced the dangers created by nuclear\r\nweapons. But the time has come to take further steps. We\r\nneed to ensure universal adherence to the ban on nuclear\r\ntests and to accelerate negotiations for the ban on the\r\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons.\r\nEndeavours towards the reduction of nuclear-weapon\r\narsenals should be intensified in order to ensure their\r\ngradual elimination.\r\nI wish to place special emphasis on the importance of\r\nthe early adoption of the international convention on a\r\ncomprehensive ban on anti-personnel landmines and their\r\ndestruction. Slovenia has joined those countries that have\r\nalready renounced their use, transfer and production, and\r\nhas been participating actively in the Ottawa process since\r\nits inception. Negotiations concerning these issues have just\r\nbeen brought to a successful conclusion at the diplomatic\r\nconference in Oslo. Early in December of this year,\r\nSlovenia will join those who intend, in the presence of the\r\nSecretary-General, to sign the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\r\nof Anti-Personnel Landmines and on Their Destruction.\r\nDisarmament efforts constitute an important element\r\nin the strengthening of international security. The formation\r\nand implementation of the regional arms control and\r\ndisarmament regimes represent an effective mechanism in\r\nstrengthening security. The experience gained during the\r\nBalkan crisis, which posed the most serious threat to peace\r\nin Europe since the foundation of the United Nations,\r\nstrengthens our belief that lower armament thresholds\r\nshould be imposed. More weapons can only present greater\r\ntemptation and danger.\r\nNone of the endeavours aimed at modernizing the\r\nOrganization by providing relevant answers to global issues\r\nwill have any guarantee of success if the United Nations\r\nproves unable to contribute to the solution of those crisis\r\nsituations that pose a threat to international peace and that\r\ngenerate humanitarian problems. These situations are now\r\nassuming larger dimensions than in any other period of\r\nUnited Nations activity to date. The credibility of the\r\nOrganization and the functioning of its main bodies must be\r\nrepeatedly proven. Special importance in this respect must\r\nbe attached to the activities of the Security Council, which,\r\nin accordance with the Charter, bears primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nToday, expectations regarding action by the Security\r\nCouncil are more realistic than they were several years\r\nago. However, they are no less demanding. The Security\r\nCouncil is taking an active part in issues concerning\r\ninternational peace on the African continent. It has proved\r\nits ability to apply a variety of the methods that are at its\r\ndisposal in accordance with the Charter. These include\r\npreventive diplomacy, cooperation with the Organization\r\nof African Unity, classic peacekeeping operations and the\r\nuse of measured and focused economic sanctions. The\r\nappropriate choice of these methods has enabled the\r\nSecurity Council to formulate relevant approaches to the\r\nsituations in Liberia, Angola and Burundi. As for some\r\nother crisis areas, including the Republic of the Congo,\r\nthe most appropriate approach still remains to be found.\r\nThe Security Council is also participating in settling\r\nissues which arise after the military conflicts. In Europe,\r\nthe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina provides an\r\nexample of such involvement. Following the conclusion\r\nof the Dayton agreement, which halted the war, the\r\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has stabilized to a\r\ncertain extent. Yet peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is\r\nstill far from secure. The return of refugees is proceeding\r\nslowly, is limited, and is facing hindrances. The\r\nauthorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have not been\r\nfunctioning as stipulated in the peace accord, and the\r\nprincipal war-crime suspects have not yet been transferred\r\nto stand trial at the International Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia. The United Nations has been performing a\r\nnumber of important tasks in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nparticularly in the areas of humanitarian aid, unarmed\r\ncivil police activity and criminal prosecution. The scope\r\nof the present engagement of the United Nations in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is, however, is in proportion with\r\nthe increased coordination of action taken in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina by other international organizations. At the\r\nsame time, success in those fields falling within the\r\ncompetence of the United Nations is of critical\r\nimportance for the establishment of lasting peace.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to stress that the\r\ninevitable starting point for solving the crisis in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina is the precise identification of the nature\r\nof that devastating war, which has not been completely\r\nstopped. If there is a lack of willingness to identify the\r\nreasons for and the nature of the war, and its aims and\r\nprotagonists, then the healing will inevitably be a lengthy\r\nand expensive process, with many risks to human life and\r\nproperty. One must even envisage the possibility that the\r\nsearch for peace might prove unsuccessful.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nThe activities underway in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nhave assumed the character of a post-conflict action, but\r\ntheir aim is also a preventive one. Experience gained in\r\nrecent years has shown that conflicts often re-emerge in the\r\nabsence of appropriate preventive action of a diplomatic,\r\neconomic or, if necessary, military character. The time to\r\nwithdraw the international forces from Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina will have to be considered very carefully.\r\nWithdrawing too early could lead to a recurrence of the\r\ninitial situation of instability or of armed conflict.\r\nAn example of successful preventive action\r\nrepresenting an important lesson for the future has been\r\nprovided by the international operation in Albania this year.\r\nOperation Alba was conducted on the initiative and under\r\nthe leadership of Italy, in agreement with the Albanian\r\nGovernment and with the authorization of the Security\r\nCouncil. That operation has shown how quick and\r\ndetermined action taken by a group of countries in the\r\nvicinity of the emerging crisis situation, and with the\r\nauthorization of the Security Council, can prevent armed\r\nconflict and potential destabilization in the region. Slovenia\r\ntook part in that successful operation and is ready to\r\nparticipate in other preventive actions, as well as in other\r\npeacekeeping operations. That readiness has been confirmed\r\nby the decision of the Security Council to include a\r\nSlovenian contingent in the peacekeeping operation in\r\nCyprus.\r\nThe recent international action in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and Albania, as examples of regional crises,\r\ndemonstrates the importance of the participation of regional\r\norganizations; such a role has been played by the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nSlovenia’s readiness to contribute towards\r\nimplementing the objectives of the United Nations has also\r\nbeen manifested by the candidature of Slovenia for a non-\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council for the period 1998-\r\n1999 in the elections to be held at the General Assembly in\r\na few weeks’ time. Slovenia has confirmed its role as a\r\nState that has been successfully coping with the issues of\r\ndevelopment and of good-neighbourly relations. Within the\r\nscope of its possibilities, it has also been striving for long-\r\nterm stabilization of the situation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and in the region at large. Through this action\r\nand its other international activity, Slovenia has proved to\r\nbe a factor for peace and stability in Europe.\r\nAs a Member of the United Nations, Slovenia is\r\nactively participating in the discussion on reform, including\r\nthe issue of reform of the Security Council. Our readiness\r\nto contribute, in practice, to the work of the Security\r\nCouncil has been manifested by our cooperation in the\r\npeacekeeping operations in Albania and in Cyprus. And\r\nlast but certainly not least, Slovenia has been paying its\r\nmembership contributions to the regular budget and to the\r\npeacekeeping budget in full and on time.\r\nAs a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council, we undertake in the event of our\r\nelection to observe the principles of openness and\r\ntransparency of action, and will strive to strengthen the\r\nties between the Security Council and rest of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nMay I in conclusion reiterate again the importance\r\nof this session of the General Assembly and of the\r\ndecisions to be taken. We have arrived at a stage where\r\nwe may see the crystallization of solutions that will\r\nprepare the United Nations to cope with the tasks of the\r\nnext century. It is our responsibility to formulate these\r\nsolutions in a sufficiently clear and comprehensive\r\nmanner, and in that way provide for the viable future of\r\nour common Organization. I firmly believe that we, the\r\npresent generation, will be able to preserve the United\r\nNations as it was created by our forefathers in the\r\nturbulent time at the end of the Second World War, as an\r\nOrganization committed to the principles of peace,\r\ncooperation, development and respect for human dignity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Slovenia\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Milan Kučan, President of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de\r\nCarvalho Veiga, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Cape Verde\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape\r\nVerde.\r\nMr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Cape Verde, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de Carvalho\r\nVeiga, Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape Verde, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Veiga (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): My delegation is pleased to greet you, Sir, as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\r\nsession. I congratulate you warmly on your election; we\r\nhave full confidence in your notable qualities as a wise and\r\nexperienced diplomat.\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for the outstanding manner in\r\nwhich he carried out his responsibilities. We all benefitted\r\nfrom his exceptional ability and his dedication.\r\nWe were delighted at the election of the illustrious\r\nAfrican Mr. Kofi Annan to the post of Secretary-General at\r\na critical time in the history of the Organization. His\r\nsplendid performance in other high United Nations posts\r\nand the creativity and dynamism that have marked the\r\nbeginning of his term justify the legitimate hopes we have\r\nall placed in him.\r\nThe numerous and complex challenges before us at the\r\ndawn of the third millennium can be faced only by the\r\ncombined will and efforts of all Member States. My\r\nGovernment fully recognizes the prominent role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the constant quest for relevant solutions.\r\nIn today’s world, in which sovereignty is less and less\r\nrespected, interdependence and globalization are becoming\r\nincreasingly real and tangible. As a result, we need the\r\ncreation of new tools capable of raising confidence to a\r\nhigher level and increasing cooperation between all\r\ninternational actors in a collective effort that alone can\r\nprovide answers to the global questions confronting us.\r\nFor several years, our Organization has been\r\nexperiencing an intensified process of reform aimed at\r\ngiving it revitalized energy, renewed representativeness and\r\nlegitimacy, increased effectiveness and greater transparency.\r\nThe first consensus is emerging, and its benefits will\r\ndoubtless soon be felt. Recent examples of this include the\r\nresolution adopted by the General Assembly following\r\ndiscussions in the Open-ended High-level Working Group\r\non the Strengthening of the United Nations System, as well\r\nas the adoption of an Agenda for Development, and the\r\ngains achieved so far on the road towards an Agenda for\r\nPeace.\r\nIt is very desirable that equally worthwhile progress\r\ntake place in parallel with regard to the financial situation\r\nof the Organization. In this regard, my country shares the\r\nvery broad consensus on the need for Member States to\r\nrespect their obligation under the Charter to pay their\r\ncontributions on time, in full and without conditions.\r\nReform of the Security Council is one of the most\r\ndifficult elements among all the reforms being studied.\r\nThe broad agreement required for a formula has not yet\r\nbeen found. Cape Verde recalls the joint position of the\r\nnon-aligned countries, which are demanding non-\r\ndiscriminatory treatment for the developing countries, in\r\nparticular with regard to the prerogatives accorded to the\r\npermanent members of the Council. For its part, Africa is\r\nnow working to refine practical means for rotation within\r\nthe continent of the seats that it expects to be at its\r\ndisposal to represent its Member States.\r\nThe Secretary-General has shown us how convinced\r\nhe is of the imperative for reform. He took certain\r\ndecisions and began to implement them. He then asked us\r\nfor advice and proposals. A fundamental objective of the\r\nproposed reforms is to provide unity and consistency to\r\nthe global activity of the system, and thereby to have an\r\nincreased impact. Structural transformations and changes\r\nin working methods are the favoured instruments for the\r\nimplementation of this objective.\r\nWe thank and warmly congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his initiative, whose focus and broad scope\r\nreveal a deep knowledge of the Organization’s situation\r\nand an enlightened vision of the directions that should be\r\ntaken. We will give constructive support to these\r\nproposals in the consultations that will soon be\r\nintensifying at different levels: in the African Group, the\r\nGroup of 77 and the General Assembly.\r\nThe quality of the future to which humankind aspires\r\ndepends on what we can do today to give human beings\r\ntheir dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the\r\nfundamental rights recognized in the international legal\r\ninstruments that reflect our collective conscience. We\r\nmust all commit ourselves to the resolute protection and\r\nconstant promotion of human rights. The United Nations\r\nis dedicated to doing so at several levels and through\r\ndifferent instruments. The Commission on Human Rights\r\nis one of the important ones, and Cape Verde is gratified\r\nthat it is able to contribute to its work. To accomplish this\r\ntask, which is limitless, we must ensure that we construct\r\nhuman rights around the axes that complement and\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\ninteract with them, as is the case with democracy and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFully functioning democracy provides a vital impetus\r\nfor the establishment of a human and institutional\r\nenvironment conducive to development and the\r\nimplementation of human rights. However, beyond the\r\nformal political dimension, conditions must be created that\r\nallow all of our citizens to live in dignity and achieve\r\nimproved standards of living. The right to development is\r\ntherefore reaffirmed as a cornerstone for concerted action\r\nto ensure that such a right can be enjoyed by everyone\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIt is time to establish a true international understanding\r\nfor development. Everything possible should be done to\r\nensure that the Agenda for Development, long the subject\r\nof negotiation and recently adopted by the General\r\nAssembly, is fully implemented in practice. In this context,\r\nwe regard as promising those concerted efforts recently\r\nmade by the global institutions, including the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization in areas\r\ncritical for development, such as financial flows, investment\r\nand commerce. We encourage the intensification of this\r\nconcerted action, which has also been requested by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and encouraged by the\r\nSecretary-General. It can make a considerable contribution\r\nto the establishment of international cooperation, leading to\r\ndevelopment at both the global and country level.\r\nWe are presently engaged in a race against the clock.\r\nMany developing countries urgently need, finally, to\r\nexperience the stirrings of an economic lift-off within the\r\ninternational trend. Otherwise, we are afraid that the hard-\r\nwon reforms of the past and present will not be sustained,\r\nand will still less be able to gain the social backing that\r\nalone can ensure the eventual transition to the second\r\ngeneration of reforms.\r\nThe progress that we envisage is not limited solely to\r\nthe economic arena. Solidarity will also be required. We\r\ncannot accept the continued existence of certain barriers\r\nthat we have erected and that are now impeding us from\r\nfully enjoying our fundamental rights. I am thinking of such\r\nperversions as racism and exclusion areas based on\r\nxenophobia, discrimination which is inflicted on so many\r\nindividuals, particularly immigrants.\r\nMigratory movements have taken place throughout\r\nhistory. We should treat them with understanding and\r\ndialogue, which will enable us to find solutions to the\r\ninevitable problems, rather than allow them to become\r\nexacerbated. In this regard, international instruments can\r\nbe extremely useful. It is important that the International\r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant\r\nWorkers and Members of Their Families finally enter into\r\nforce. We also hope that the Assembly will follow up the\r\nresolution of the Economic and Social Council on\r\nconvening a world conference against racism, racial and\r\nethnic discrimination, xenophobia and other related\r\ncontemporary forms of intolerance.\r\nOn this continuing and unequal march towards\r\ndevelopment, in which all are involved, some of our\r\ncountries remain among the least advanced. At a time of\r\nincreased globalization, to warn against the risk of\r\nconsolidating and perpetuating the marginalization of\r\nthese countries is not mere rhetorical overstatement. On\r\nthe contrary, this danger is very real. The least-developed\r\ncountries’ share of world exports continues to languish at\r\nvery low levels, and their rate of growth even dropped in\r\n1996.\r\nExternal trade is vital for reversing the present\r\nsituation of the least developed countries. The decision\r\nadopted in Marrakesh regarding measures to help them,\r\nas well as the World Trade Organization Plan of Action\r\nadopted last December in Singapore, recognize that the\r\nleast developed countries urgently need to achieve a\r\nlasting increase in their exports. These countries must\r\ntherefore significantly improve their competitive\r\ncapability, and their exports of goods and services must\r\nhave free access to all global markets.\r\nIn this sense, we are expecting initiatives from the\r\nhigh-level meeting on the least developed countries, to be\r\nheld next month in Geneva aided by increased\r\ninstitutional synergy between those international bodies\r\nwith competence and responsibility in areas critical for\r\nthe development of the least developed countries.\r\nThe foreign debt of these countries continues to\r\ngrow. The problem continues to be inadequately handled,\r\nas regards both the categories of countries covered by\r\ninitiatives and the actual level of the initiatives. All least\r\ndeveloped countries — not only the most critically\r\naffected — need adequate and lasting relief.\r\nMoreover, the financing of certain elements\r\nindispensable for international integration of these\r\ncountries, such as infrastructure and education, to cite\r\nonly a few, requires a significantly increased flow of\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\npublic development aid. For the least developed countries,\r\nthis will become ever more necessary in the future.\r\nIn Cape Verde, a least developed country which has\r\nsuffered a prolonged drought, there is today national\r\nconsensus about the country’s future and the major paths to\r\nbe followed. The reforms which we are undertaking have\r\nthe support of the nation, which can legitimately aspire to\r\nimproving its living conditions today, and not in the distant\r\nfuture.\r\nThe fact that the African continent contains the\r\nmajority of the world’s least developed countries speaks\r\neloquently of its limitations. For the international\r\ncommunity, Africa is a test of its will and its ability to\r\nmeet the challenge of global development. The world will\r\nnot be developed so long as Africa is not developed.\r\nSolutions, as we know, begin at home. The present\r\nand the recent past of our continent confirm that we\r\nunderstand this, and are acting upon it more and more. I\r\ntake this opportunity to thank those in the international\r\ncommunity who are firmly supporting Africa’s development\r\nand encourage them to have greater confidence in the future\r\nof our continent and in the partnership between Africa and\r\nits friends.\r\nIf the Africans continue to step up the changes under\r\nway in the right direction, and if there is concrete progress\r\nand cooperation in the international environment, it is likely\r\nthat the positive signs of the last few years will\r\nprogressively be consolidated in Africa.\r\nHowever, there are constraints of another nature\r\nimpeding the general progress sought by our continent:\r\nsituations of conflict and potential conflict, which continue\r\nto proliferate, some of them particularly bloody.\r\nExperience — particularly recent experience — has shown\r\nthat these conflicts are often highly complex. They become\r\ndeeply rooted and thus thwart any diplomatic or other\r\nattempts at solution. However, that is no reason for the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States to give up their\r\nefforts to solve these problems.\r\nWorking together and in concert with the United\r\nNations, the Africans are becoming more active in their\r\nefforts at the regional level to contribute to preventing and\r\nmanaging the conflicts on the continent. Africa needs\r\ninternational support in order to step up its capacities in this\r\narea. Such support should not become a means of\r\ndiscrimination, negative or positive, with regard to certain\r\nconflicts as compared with others, based on the subjective\r\npreferences of donors. The multilateral nature of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) implies avoidance of this risk and balanced\r\ntreatment of conflict situations.\r\nThe case of Angola has called for the greatest efforts\r\nof the United Nations in Africa — lengthy and repeated\r\nefforts. Unfortunately, a new deterioration in the situation,\r\nwith violent consequences, is not impossible at a time\r\nwhen UNITA is persisting in failing to respect the terms\r\nof the Lusaka Accords. Therefore, the most recent\r\nSecurity Council resolution on Angola is fully justified,\r\nand we hope that it will have the desired effect. Only a\r\nfew days from the expiration of its time limit, we urge\r\nUNITA to take the decisive steps required for lasting\r\npeace in Angola.\r\nWe would like to reaffirm here the support of Cape\r\nVerde for the people of East Timor in its quest for\r\ngenuine self-determination, the preservation of its identity,\r\nand recognition of and total respect for its rights. We\r\nwelcomed the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 to\r\ntwo eminent individuals from East Timor, Don Ximenes\r\nBelo and Ramos-Horta. That award brought even more\r\ninternational attention to the situation of their people. It is\r\ntime for reason and justice to prevail, and we welcome\r\nthe appointment of a Special Representative for East\r\nTimor by the Secretary-General within the framework of\r\nhis redoubled efforts to assist in finding an equitable\r\nsolution to the conflict in the territory.\r\nLast June, a special session of the General Assembly\r\nto assess the implementation of Agenda 21 achieved\r\nmeagre results. All sides — Governments, international\r\ninstitutions and social groups — are again challenged to\r\nhonour the Rio commitments and show more\r\ndetermination and responsibility on the environment.\r\nCertainly, with regard to control of the causes of\r\nenvironmental degradation and long-term management of\r\nthe planet’s non-renewable resources, different parties\r\nhave different responsibilities, but those responsibilities\r\nare shared. Among the numerous constraining factors,\r\npopulation and consumption remain major factors. While\r\ndemographic growth presents encouraging medium- and\r\nlong-term indicators, unbalanced rates of consumption\r\npersist and even increase, putting unsustainable pressure\r\non resources.\r\nMy country, a country of the Sahel and an island\r\nnation, is particularly sensitive to certain threats to the\r\nenvironment, such as drought and desertification, which\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nwere the subject of an international Convention giving\r\nparticular attention to the situation in Africa. The\r\nPermanent International Committee for Drought Control in\r\nthe Sahel (CILSS), of which Cape Verde is a member, is\r\ntaking action with a visible impact, which merits continued\r\nsupport by its external partners.\r\nAnother factor for environmental deterioration — this\r\ntime a social one — is the scourge of drugs and the human\r\ndegradation to which it leads. To combat illegal drug\r\ntrafficking and the laundering of the money it generates,\r\nclose international cooperation is required, particularly in\r\nthe exchange of information and logistical and material\r\nsupport. This is a global phenomenon, and the means to\r\ncombat it must also be formulated globally, with national\r\nand regional foundations. The West African subregion,\r\nthrough the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), has begun concerted efforts. The Political\r\nDeclaration of Praia last July laid down the basis for\r\ngrowing cooperation between the countries involved.\r\nThe last years of this millennium mark the end of an\r\nextraordinary period. The era which began with the fall of\r\nthe Berlin Wall will go down in history as an era of an\r\nexplosion of the ideals of liberty and progress such as had\r\nnot been seen since the great wave of independence in the\r\n1960s.\r\nThese gains, together with the dizzying advances of\r\nscience and technology, attest to mankind’s extraordinary\r\nability to come up with imaginative answers. However,\r\nmankind has not yet freed itself from feelings of\r\nindifference and exclusion, and often even of hate. This is\r\nperhaps the major challenge as this century comes to a\r\nclose.\r\nThe complete achievement of the noble objectives of\r\nthe Charter would doubtless represent a decisive step\r\ntowards such emancipation.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape Verde\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Carlos Alberto Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Cape Verde, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Lithuania, His Excellency Mr. Algirdas\r\nSaudargas.\r\nMr. Saudargas (Lithuania): Allow me to begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to your\r\nhonourable post. You may count on our full support and\r\ndedication to your goals.\r\nYou, Sir, have inherited the legacy of the outgoing\r\nPresident, Ambassador Razali Ismail, which we can build\r\non: friendly atmosphere, lively debates, productive spirit,\r\nstrong desire for change and reform, and, last but not\r\nleast, brilliant management of the Assembly’s work. My\r\nGovernment congratulates Ambassador Razali on his\r\noutstanding performance.\r\nI come from a country that is in the midst of\r\ncomprehensive reforms. Top-to-bottom institutional\r\nchanges have reshaped our society from its very roots,\r\nestablishing a commonly accepted democratic way of life.\r\nRadical changes involved in introducing a market\r\neconomy have borne fruit. Today, our democracy and\r\nmarket economy are inextricably linked with the new\r\nsecurity and economic framework of a united Europe.\r\nOur reform experience demonstrates that the courage\r\nto grasp the moment — to respond rapidly if and when\r\nthe changing situation requires — a key for success. We\r\nhave this key in our hands, and we need the determination\r\nto use it. With the end of the cold war, the fall of the\r\nbipolar system and the failure of power politics have\r\ngiven us a new chance to look deeper into the core of the\r\nUnited Nations and to reshape it in line with the needs\r\nand expectations of its Member States and for the benefit\r\nof all. The picture of the road ahead is visible.\r\nWe want this session of the General Assembly to be\r\ndominated by the programme of reforms. Lithuania’s\r\nGovernment supports the Secretary-General’s reform\r\ninitiative, which is expected to spur most fundamental\r\nchanges. We are confident that the Secretary-General will\r\nsuccessfully implement that part of his programme which\r\nfalls within his own responsibility.\r\nIt is unlikely that everyone will be happy about\r\nevery part of the proposed reforms. We, the Member\r\nStates, have to see the Secretary-General’s proposals in\r\ntheir entirety, and, rising above narrow national interests,\r\nfind a compromise on every step that brings us closer to\r\na more focused, more efficient, more transparent and\r\nmore democratic United Nations. Lithuania is ready to\r\nplay an active part in achieving agreement on a United\r\nNations structure that will reflect the nature of the United\r\nNations mandate and its core functions: maintenance of\r\npeace and security, sustainable development and\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\npromotion of human rights, humanitarian assistance, and\r\nsocial and economic progress. They should be placed within\r\na strict time-frame. Otherwise, lack of dynamics in the\r\nnegotiation process will cause a loss of direction.\r\nWhat is of special concern to us is that the financial\r\ndifficulties of the Organization are affecting its performance\r\nand endanger the progress of reforms. Lithuania will fulfil\r\nits financial obligations to the United Nations and urges\r\nother States to do so. At the same time, United Nations\r\nfinancing must reflect a State’s capacity to pay. The scheme\r\nof limits has to be removed from the new scale of\r\nassessments that is to be negotiated this autumn. Lithuania\r\ncontinues to support the package of comprehensive\r\nproposals put forward by the European Union designed to\r\nput the Organization on a sound and predictable financial\r\nfooting.\r\nAlthough the reform of the Security Council started as\r\na separate process, it is now part of the entire package of\r\nUnited Nations reform. It was inspired by the general\r\nacknowledgement that the time had come for the Council\r\nto reflect new realities in world politics. Today we have\r\nmore nations able and willing to serve permanently on the\r\nSecurity Council than in the days of its inception. Two such\r\nStates are Germany and Japan. Asia, Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica, too, legitimately aspire to have new permanent\r\nseats. And there are more States whose contributions to the\r\ngoals of the United Nations point to the need for greater\r\nappreciation and better accommodation of their interests.\r\nWe want a comprehensive reform of the Council\r\nwhereby the number of non-permanent seats increases as\r\nwell. The Group of Eastern European States, whose number\r\nhas more than doubled over the past few years, deserves at\r\nleast one additional seat. Our position on this is very firm.\r\nWe also need a more transparent and democratic\r\nSecurity Council. But, most important, the reform should\r\ncontinue to progress. This year’s discussions have been\r\nproductive, thanks to the efforts of the former President of\r\nthe General Assembly, Ambassador Razali. I hope the\r\nprocess will retain its vigour.\r\nIn the post-confrontation era, there are far too many\r\nweapons around the world. Fortunately, today there are\r\nmore tools to control the spread of the most deadly\r\nweapons. Last year we adopted the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty — a major breakthrough in\r\nnuclear disarmament, which is feasible when pursued in\r\nconsecutive steps. The next step should be to ban the\r\nspread of fissile material for nuclear warheads.\r\nThe world’s attention has been captured by the\r\nnegotiations in Oslo on the agreement to ban one of the\r\nmost inhumane weapons: anti-personnel landmines. We\r\nsupport these efforts, which require profound rethinking\r\nof national defence strategies in many countries, including\r\nLithuania. Confidence-building measures and security\r\ncooperation will help humanitarian concerns reign over\r\nmilitary purposes.\r\nWe have faith in regional and bilateral efforts to\r\ndisarm. Europe has set out on the path of toughening the\r\nrequirements for the stationing of conventional forces,\r\nthrough the adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional\r\nArmed Forces in Europe. We support this process and\r\nbelieve that it can be a model for other regions.\r\nEven though the total number of peacekeeping\r\noperations and their average size have been reduced in\r\nrecent years, peacekeeping is still the key instrument\r\navailable to the United Nations in discharging its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Together with Estonia and Latvia, and with\r\nPoland, Lithuania is developing joint peacekeeping units.\r\nApart from its genuine objective of contributing to United\r\nNations goals, this exercise is, in itself, a testimony to full\r\nunderstanding and cooperation among the neighbouring\r\ncountries of our region.\r\nIn recent years we have witnessed an increase in the\r\nrole and functions of international civilian police in\r\npeacekeeping operations. The civilian police forces can\r\nplay a major role, through assistance to local police\r\nforces, in rebuilding national police and judicial systems,\r\nin restoring civil order, in supporting the rule of law and\r\nin facilitating national reconciliation. The need for\r\nassistance from international civilian police is likely to\r\nincrease. It can be met by properly functioning United\r\nNations standby arrangements, which are designed to\r\nexpand the rapid-deployment capacity of the Organization.\r\nLithuania has decided to join the United Nations system\r\nof standby arrangements for peacekeeping operations.\r\nLater today, I shall submit to the Secretary-General a\r\ndetailed description of our permanently available\r\ncontribution, including well-trained police officers.\r\nNations around the world are being challenged by\r\ncertain phenomena which know no boundaries and which\r\ncan be tackled only by joint action. Fighting international\r\ncrime, drug trafficking and terrorism and ensuring\r\nenvironmental protection and humanitarian aid are among\r\nsuch challenges.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nLithuania wholeheartedly supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform effort to strengthen, through the United\r\nNations entities in Vienna, the Organization’s capacity\r\ncoherently and systematically to address threats to the\r\nstability and development of society created by\r\ntransnational crime in all its manifestations. For its part, the\r\nGovernment of Lithuania is determined to enhance regional\r\nstructures combating transnational organized crime as well\r\nas fully to implement bilateral, regional and multilateral\r\nagreements in this area.\r\nWe also look forward to the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1998, which should enable the\r\ninternational community to develop new and improved\r\nstrategies to address the problem of illicit narcotic drugs.\r\nAlthough the nineteenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly was not a milestone of success and ended with\r\nfew commitments, we strongly believe that the political will\r\ndemonstrated by the presence of so many Heads of State\r\nand Government will be translated into action. The next\r\noccasion to demonstrate the seriousness of our intentions to\r\nprotect the environment and to agree on specific targets for\r\nreducing the emission of greenhouse gases, which were not\r\nrealized at the special session, will be the third session of\r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in\r\nKyoto, Japan, this December.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights will afford a great occasion to see what\r\nhas been done and what can be done about the protection\r\nof and respect for basic international human rights.\r\nWe welcome the appointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson\r\nas the High Commissioner for Human Rights and express\r\nour support for the structural reforms of the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and\r\nthe Centre for Human Rights. Internal restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations human rights organs should go hand in hand\r\nwith close cooperation in human rights issues between the\r\nUnited Nations and such regional arrangements as the\r\nCouncil of Europe, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and others.\r\nIllegal migration and trafficking in migrants threaten\r\nstability in Central and Eastern Europe. We believe that\r\ntreaties on readmission between the States of the region\r\ncould be a key instrument against these threats. Lithuania\r\nurges the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates that have not yet done so to accede to the 1951\r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967\r\nProtocol and to further strengthen national institutions\r\nresponsible for the management of migration flows.\r\nWe believe in a regional approach to regional issues.\r\nWe praise the United Nations reliance on regional\r\norganizations. The Organization for Cooperation and\r\nSecurity in Europe is a good example of what a regional\r\ninstitution with a limited budget can do rather than\r\nplacing the burden on the United Nations. The North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is another good\r\nexample. The record of the two organizations in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia is much better than what could have\r\nbeen achieved had the United Nations alone dealt with the\r\nwar.\r\nAlong with other measures towards a more\r\nconsolidated peace, good-neighbourly relations have\r\nbecome vital for regional security and stability. We have\r\ndone our utmost to establish and maintain friendly\r\nrelations with our neighbours, while simultaneously taking\r\npractical steps towards integration into the European\r\nUnion and NATO. The accession of Lithuania to\r\nEuropean and transatlantic institutions will have a\r\nsignificant impact on lasting security and stability.\r\nYesterday the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Primakov,\r\nproposed a different security model of our region.\r\nHowever, creating a substitute for transatlantic integration\r\nis not in line with our vision. The international Vilnius\r\nconference entitled, “Coexistence of Nations and Good\r\nNeighbourhood Relations — A Guarantee of Security and\r\nStability in Europe”, for which Lithuanian and Polish\r\nPresidents Algirdas Brazauskas and Aleksander\r\nKwasniewski acted as hosts in September of this year and\r\nwhich was attended by 12 Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, received joint greetings from the Presidents\r\nof Germany and France, Roman Herzog and Jacques\r\nChirac. They wrote:\r\n\"It is time to foster a culture of cooperation and\r\ndialogue all over Europe and to harness the political\r\nenergies of our peoples to bring about reconciliation\r\nand understanding ... Only in a spirit of unity,\r\ncommunity, friendship and good- neighbourly\r\nrelations, as well as mutual understanding, will we\r\nbe able to build the future of our continent.\"\r\nHere at the United Nations, I am tempted to quote this\r\nsentence, but with the last word, \"continent,\" in the plural.\r\nThe President: I now call upon the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Venezuela, His Excellency Mr. Miguel\r\nAngel Burelli Rivas.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nMr. Burelli Rivas (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Speaking here on behalf of my country, I wish to\r\ncongratulate the new Secretary-General of the Organization,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, after nine months in his post, now\r\nfor the first time faces the responsibility of a session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, a session that is likely to be noteworthy\r\nand hard-working. Given his vast experience, he is well\r\naware that the prestige and influence of his important post\r\nderive from the impartiality that places him above all\r\npressure of interests and raises him to the permanent status\r\nof arbitrator for all and a symbol of the Organization.\r\nMr. Panou (Togo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nI also wish to offer my congratulations to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\r\non his appointment as President of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe pace of events today means that subjects that we\r\nconsidered just last year seem obsolete. Nevertheless, as we\r\nhave still not found solutions to the most pressing problems\r\nfacing the international community, it is logical to keep\r\nreturning to those that are of concern to every member of\r\nthat community and to the community as a whole, which\r\nnow finds itself in the midst of the most rapid process of\r\nchange in history.\r\nInevitably, therefore, we will again go over, for\r\nexample, human rights, the rule of law, free elections, the\r\nwar on drugs, corruption, disarmament, terrorism and other\r\ncompelling issues that crop up constantly among our\r\nconcerns and in our work nowadays.\r\nI must place on record the fact that the Government of\r\nVenezuela has taken measures on all these issues to ensure\r\nincreased respect for human rights, to wage war on drugs\r\nand to promote further disarmament and assist in the fight\r\nagainst corruption. Naturally, it is not easy for any country\r\nto show a clean record. A Government’s good intentions as\r\nregards human rights will always immediately come up\r\nagainst recurring internal violence and still untamed unruly\r\nelements, as in the example constantly presented by the\r\naudiovisual media in developed countries. But the will\r\nexists and an effort is being made to make Government\r\nagencies increasingly aware of our resolve to protect\r\nguarantee human rights.\r\nI wish to highlight the work done by the first United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador, Mr. José Ayala-\r\nLasso, and welcome the new High Commissioner, the\r\nformer President of Ireland, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to\r\nwhom my country wishes every success in the stimulating\r\nbut difficult task ahead of her.\r\nWith regard to corruption, terrorism and\r\ndisarmament, my country, which proposed and was able\r\nto gain approval for the Inter-American Convention —\r\nthe first of its kind in the world — in March 1996,\r\nremains steadfast in its efforts to ensure that every\r\ncountry is aware of the need to punish wrongdoing in\r\ngovernment, wrongdoing that has tended to be treated\r\nwith great indulgence. It may not be possible to eradicate\r\ncorruption, but timely punishment — by ending\r\nimpunity — will make such action risky.\r\nWe have been enthusiastic supporters of all\r\ninitiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade, in addition to\r\nbeing aware that there are free markets often beyond\r\nGovernment control, we are concerned that the\r\nindustrialized countries, by lifting embargoes in this field,\r\nmay begin moving towards the opposite extreme and\r\npromote the sale of weapons everywhere, under pressure\r\nfrom the military industry, which has an extremely\r\npowerful lobby.\r\nMy country has resolutely backed the programme to\r\neliminate landmines, hundreds of millions of which have\r\nbeen irresponsibly and thoughtlessly scattered in\r\nterritories on every continent, daily taking their toll of\r\nmany innocent victims, particularly children, whose\r\nmutilation by landmines is a constant reminder that we\r\nneed to ensure justice for humankind.\r\nThe fact that Venezuela has a neighbour where\r\nillegal drugs continue to be planted, processed and sold\r\nplaces us in the unfortunate position of being part of the\r\nsupply route and within an area influenced by drug\r\nmoney. That is why the Government of Venezuela has\r\ntaken every precaution to keep this danger to a minimum.\r\nIt fights trafficking on land and sea and in the air, and\r\nhas intercepted large shipments of drugs. The official in\r\ncharge of all Government action against this powerful\r\nenemy of humankind has been given the rank of Minister.\r\nIt goes without saying that we look forward\r\nhopefully to the next special session of the General\r\nAssembly, on illegal drug trafficking, to be held at the\r\nrequest of Mexico. We hope that it will produce clear\r\nsolutions that will enable us to wage a more successful\r\nwar on this scourge and, above all, put an end to money\r\nlaundering, where Government efforts have so far been\r\nleast successful.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nAs the threat of ever more pitiless and atrocious acts\r\nof terrorism has spread around the world and, to no small\r\nextent, here on our American continent, Venezuela has\r\ntaken an interest in ensuring that the international\r\ncommunity is made increasingly aware of its\r\nresponsibilities in joint efforts to approve a convention for\r\nthe suppression of terrorist bombings. That convention is\r\ncurrently being considered by the General Assembly, in a\r\nbody that should be completing its work shortly.\r\nWhen the Inter-American Convention against\r\nCorruption was approved, we voiced our hope that, given\r\nthat the disregard for of ethical standards that has fostered\r\nthis crime has been a worldwide and not a strictly\r\nAmerican phenomenon, the subject would one day be taken\r\nup by the United Nations in order to produce an\r\ninternational convention giving voice to the concern felt by\r\nall countries over this problem and harnessing the general\r\nwillingness to put an end to impunity. The day seems to\r\nhave come when the Member States of this Organization\r\nwill work together to do away with the tolerance\r\nencountered on all continents towards this canker afflicting\r\npolitics and administration; a canker whose breeding ground\r\nis not underdevelopment, but the moral decay of the State\r\nand society; a canker that seriously and increasingly hinders\r\nthe trade that is a necessary part of economic globalization.\r\nMy Government has welcomed the idea of changes not\r\nonly in the structure, but even in the philosophy of this 50-\r\nyear-old Organization. Since the lives of the peoples of this\r\nworld have undergone such profound changes, it would be\r\ninexcusable for the United Nations, which represents them\r\nall, to remain untouched.\r\nWe have considered the various plans for reforms and\r\nwatched the efforts made by the outgoing President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly over these past few months to achieve\r\nsome, at least, of the essential changes to the system during\r\nhis term in office. And, although we believe this issue to be\r\nboth timely and urgent, we do not feel that there is\r\nimminent consensus on the suggested changes which, above\r\nall, relate to membership on the Security Council. In any\r\ncase, it is only fair to recognize the serious efforts being\r\nmade to end the stagnation within this Organization and\r\nlaunch the debate that is just beginning.\r\nVenezuela supports an increase in the number of\r\npermanent Members on the Security Council, provided\r\nthere is no discrimination of any kind and that there is due\r\nregard for the interests of the international community,\r\nincluding fair representation of all geographical regions, in\r\nline with other new circumstances.\r\nWe feel that there are great expectations and high\r\nhopes that the Secretariat will become more efficient and\r\nthat the Organization’s burden of projected expenditures\r\nmay be eased. It is also essential that Member States pay\r\ntheir contributions on time. None of us can refuse to\r\nhonour a freely accepted obligation, nor make payment\r\nconditional in a way that presents a threat to the equality\r\nof States and the dignity of the world forum of which we\r\nare a part.\r\nMy country’s position, however, is not limited to\r\nthis alone. It goes beyond an analysis of the opportunities\r\nand rules of the veto to the elimination of the veto\r\naltogether. It has to do with the reform of the Secretariat\r\nitself and with economic and social issues, especially\r\nfunding for development, as envisaged in the relevant\r\ndocument. That is why we feel that consideration should\r\nbe given to the ideas recently expressed by both the\r\nGroup of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement as regards\r\nnot only this subject, but also consensus on the other\r\nreforms.\r\nVenezuela supports the convening of an international\r\nconference on financing for development, in cooperation\r\nwith international financial institutions, to propose\r\ninnovative and bold mechanisms in this area. Such\r\nmechanisms must include the mobilization of capital\r\nresources for investment in non-industrialized countries\r\nwhile at the same time, opening the door to the\r\nopportunities offered by the private sector.\r\nNon-governmental organizations — increasingly\r\nactive in today’s world — could contribute even more\r\ntowards attainment of the aims of the Charter of United\r\nNations in this field of action. My country has launched\r\nan intensive round of consultations with these\r\norganizations in what it has called a “Dialogue between\r\nsenior Government and non-governmental organizations”,\r\nso as to draw up a plan for the promotion, protection and\r\nobservance of human rights in Venezuela.\r\nWe welcomed the Convention on the Law of the\r\nNon-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses as\r\na well-conceived initiative. That is why Venezuela played\r\nan active role in the various stages of the drafting of the\r\ndocument, which required years of work, and led to the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of a document that includes\r\nvirtually all the provisions on this subject that exist in\r\ninternational law. My country signed the Convention\r\nyesterday and we call upon other countries to do the\r\nsame.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nAs Venezuela has always been in favour of the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court, we wish to\r\ndraw attention to what the international community has\r\ndone to deal with and punish international crimes against\r\npeace and security, first with the creation of ad hoc courts\r\nand then with the creation of a permanent body such as that\r\ncourt. By thus institutionalizing and centralizing the\r\npolitical will of States, we will help prevent the possibility\r\nof the winners in a conflict from being tempted to become\r\nthe judges of the defeated.\r\nThis seems the appropriate time and place to mention\r\nthe Ibero-American community of which Venezuela is a\r\npart and the five hundredth anniversary of Christopher\r\nColumbus’s only landing on continental America in his\r\nvoyages.\r\nSince 1991, 500 years after the discovery of America,\r\nthanks to an initiative of the King of Spain, the 21\r\ncountries that proudly share the honour of being members\r\nof the Ibero-American community have met once a year, in\r\na different city each time. I say “proudly” because in their\r\ncolonial endeavours both Spain and Portugal took a\r\nmissionary approach. While imposing their political power\r\nand territorial government, they also disseminated\r\nChristianity and passed on with conviction their European\r\ncivilization and culture. Thus in Spanish and Portuguese\r\nAmerica, the mixing of blood and cultures took root,\r\nmaking our world a different one, a world characterized by\r\nsocial egalitarianism, religious tolerance and a strong and\r\ndeeply rooted freedom. The effects of this situation, which\r\ndefines and unites American existence from north to south,\r\nmakes this community stand out. It does not set it apart\r\nfrom others, but, in this era of globalization, it affirms the\r\nvery particular features of Ibero-American identity.\r\nThis idea has evolved well, beginning in Guadalajara,\r\nthen continuing in Madrid, Salvador de Bahia, Cartagena,\r\nBariloche and Santiago. The seventh summit meeting will\r\nbe held on Margarita Island in my country.\r\nAs the host country suggests the key topic for\r\ndiscussion at each meeting, the President of Venezuela,\r\nMr. Rafael Caldera, has proposed the general heading of\r\n“Ethical values of democracy”, a suggestion that has been\r\naccepted with great enthusiasm.\r\nThe Governments of Venezuela and the other 20\r\ncountries of Ibero-America insist that it is not enough to\r\nhave formal democracy if corruption is rampant, if\r\ninefficiency persists, if justice is not effective, or if the\r\naction taken by the democratic sectors is neither\r\nsatisfactory nor transparent.\r\nThus, this general topic encompasses other very\r\nspecific issues having to do with social justice, human\r\nrights, electoral transparency elections, the sincerity of\r\npolitical parties and, unavoidably, truth in information.\r\nThat is the nucleus of the agenda for the meeting to be\r\nheld on 8 and 9 November on Margarita Island.\r\nIt is not out of place to explain to this Assembly that\r\nthere are good reasons for this agenda. The economic\r\nchanges and the political upheavals of our world have\r\nwreaked havoc on the set of values that was, until\r\nrecently, the foundation on which people’s lives rested.\r\nThe weakness of social justice is pathetic. In more\r\nthan a few countries, unavoidable macroeconomic\r\nadjustments have affected vast numbers of people who are\r\nvictims of injustice and who are unable, both mentally\r\nand physically, of coping with these changes, leaving\r\nthem even worse off than they were before. Something\r\nmust be done to improve the lot of these multitudes\r\nduring a transition that, although necessary, is still\r\npainful.\r\nThe subject of human rights, which I mentioned\r\nbriefly at the beginning of my statement, is vitally\r\nimportant, and it would not be surprising if some day it\r\nwere to replace “democracy” as a term and as a concept.\r\nCertain statements on this subject may have been\r\nexaggerated in the heat of the moment. But the truth is\r\nthat we must march firmly forward towards a time when\r\nevery human being, without exception, feels for his fellow\r\nman the same respect that he asks for himself. This is a\r\nmatter of education, training and will on the part of\r\nGovernments, so that the bad examples from the more\r\ndeveloped countries that are passed on by the media do\r\nnot lead the developing countries to continue violating\r\nthese rights.\r\nDespite the fact that democracy has taken root in\r\nvirtually all the countries in our region — seemingly the\r\ndesideratum of our times — it now faces a variety of\r\ndangers, such as elections rigged by international\r\norganized crime. The most specific and dangerous case\r\nhas to do with the influential role that drug trafficking\r\nand money laundering now play in elections, allowing\r\ncrime to become closely entwined with political power.\r\nMy country’s position in this regard is to warn\r\npolitical parties to make sure their electoral campaigns are\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\ntransparent by keeping these campaigns short and to the\r\npoint so as to avoid any improper financial influence.\r\nDemocracy is, by its very nature, a system of political\r\nparties. There is no democratic system without political\r\nparties. Yet it is obvious that the downfall of democracy is\r\noften due to carelessness on the part of the political parties\r\non which it is based, when, setting aside the ethics of\r\nservice, ideology and efficiency, they are tempted to take\r\nadvantage of the resources of the State using the pretext of\r\nlengthy, complex and costly election campaigns. It would\r\nseem that the time has come to return to the old political\r\nideas or to invent new means of expression in order to heal\r\nand revitalize democracy.\r\nMany people reacted by voicing doubts and fears\r\nwhen the subject of the people’s right to truthful\r\ninformation was raised. Media groups have even claimed\r\nthat this proposal is full of hidden dangers. Nevertheless,\r\nthe straightforward intent of this proposal is to strengthen\r\nthe influence of the media at a time when they are virtually\r\nthe first estate. We consider this right to be the counterpart\r\nto the media’s right to carry out their activities in absolute\r\nfreedom, given the fact that society legitimately aspires, in\r\nturn, to be properly, accurately and truthfully informed.\r\nIn an era in which the media have the most amazing\r\ntechnologies at their disposal — such as those providing\r\ninstantaneous communication — there can be no\r\nexplanation for information that distorts, embellishes or\r\ntampers with the truth. All the power that we give the\r\nmedia, essential for the values of democracy, would be lost\r\nif the media were to step outside their role and begin\r\nvoicing opinions instead of reporting or made themselves\r\npart of the day-to-day debate of ideas.\r\nWhat Venezuela hopes to achieve by this debate is to\r\nmake clear the responsibilities that each actor must play in\r\na democracy, and the media are very important actors. That\r\nis the reason for this initiative: to warn and caution them,\r\nnot by suggesting rules, but by appealing to a sense of\r\nresponsibility, prompted by their own conscience, with\r\nregard to the worthy part that information must play in\r\nbuilding a safe and trusting society.\r\nFollowing on from comments I made at this year’s\r\nIbero-American Summit in Venezuela, I wish to mention\r\nthe five-hundredth anniversary of the day when Christopher\r\nColumbus set foot on continental America, in August 1498,\r\nat the Paria Peninsula in Venezuela. Until then the feats of\r\nexploration by the discoverer of the New World had been\r\nlimited to the islands of the Caribbean. He was not\r\nabsolutely sure that he was actually standing on\r\ncontinental soil when in 1498 he reached Macuro, a small\r\nvillage on the eastern coast of Venezuela, but he certainly\r\nwondered as he witnessed the thrust of a strong current\r\nthat overcame the gentle waves and gave proof of the\r\npresence of a great river, the Orinoco. This was an\r\nextremely important event for my country, which we plan\r\nto commemorate properly. It was the only time the great\r\nadmiral stood on terra firma, which he called “Land of\r\nGrace”. In making this announcement, we hope the global\r\ncommunity will join us in our celebration.\r\nIn closing, I wish to express Venezuela’s faith in the\r\nability of the Organization to act as a permanent arbitrator\r\nfor peace and development. There is a greater need every\r\nday for the United Nations to act as the voice and\r\nconscience of humanity, but never as the spokesperson or\r\ntool of any group, region or interest other than the\r\ncommunity which created it and of which it is the core.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nInternational Trade and Worship of Argentina, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Guido di Tella, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Di Tella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): In recent years we have, happily, drawn closer\r\nto the ideals enshrined in the preamble of our Charter.\r\nWe have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of\r\npeace and security; strengthened and broadened the\r\nobservance of human rights; enhanced and developed\r\ninternational law and widened the scope of international\r\npenal law, in particular; and laid the foundations for\r\ngreater responsibility by States in the advancement of\r\nsocial progress.\r\nHowever, even as we draw closer to these goals, we\r\nsee rapid changes in our countries and in the world which\r\npresent a new and complex challenge for the\r\nOrganization. The challenge begins when we note that the\r\nbenefits of globalization fall short of being able to\r\nalleviate the situation of extreme deprivation from which\r\nmore than a quarter of the world’s population suffers.\r\nSimilarly, we see more clearly new threats to security and\r\ndevelopment, such as drug trafficking, terrorism,\r\ncorruption, and irresponsible assaults upon the\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe process of reform undertaken by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan must first and foremost identify what\r\nis the essential role of the United Nations. We believe\r\nthat it unquestionably continues to be the maintenance of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\ninternational peace and security. In order to achieve this we\r\nmust bring about a world where sustainable development is\r\npossible and where the norm is the rule of law; respect for\r\nhuman rights, including respect for the rights of indigenous\r\npeoples and minorities; and non-discrimination by reason of\r\nrace, religion, gender or anything else.\r\nThe United Nations, through the General Assembly,\r\nmust continue to be in the vanguard on all these issues,\r\nplaying the role which in the past enabled it to overcome\r\nthe scepticism of the times and successfully to combat\r\ncolonialism, champion nuclear non-proliferation, and, even\r\nmore important, alert the world to the grave risks of\r\nenvironmental pollution, marginalization, poverty and that\r\nnew form of moral pollution: corruption.\r\nAlthough, on the whole, reform has aroused feelings\r\nof hope, we must overcome the present climate of\r\nscepticism and support the Secretary-General. In a world\r\nwhich today is increasingly marked by globalization, the\r\nautonomy which formerly characterized State action has\r\nbeen considerably limited. This obliges us to reassess the\r\nclassical concept of sovereignty, by which I mean flexible\r\nand dynamic — not static — reassessment. Argentina has\r\nparticipated with conviction in the process of reform and\r\ncommits itself to continue to work actively in its\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe question of the Middle East is going through a\r\ndifficult phase. The peace process begun in Madrid in 1991\r\nmust necessarily continue, with fulfilment of the Oslo and\r\nWashington Agreements.\r\nWe fully support the determined efforts made some\r\ndays ago by the Secretary of State of the United States of\r\nAmerica, Mrs. Madeleine Albright. We are certain that time\r\nwill show that those efforts were timely and well-directed.\r\nOur country likewise firmly supports the system-wide\r\nProgramme of Action for the economic recovery and\r\ndevelopment of Africa, as well as the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa launched by the\r\nSecretary-General in March 1996. We attach particular\r\nimportance to the mobilization of financial resources for the\r\nAfrican continent, and we note with satisfaction the first\r\nsigns of renewed activity in some very important areas of\r\nthat continent.\r\nWith regard to international security, we welcome the\r\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nwhich we hope shortly to ratify. Likewise, we extend our\r\nunqualified support to the Ottawa process to ban anti-\r\npersonnel landmines. Our commitment to this noble\r\ninitiative was made manifest in 1994, when we offered to\r\nassume the task of removing the mines laid in the\r\nMalvinas Islands. We laid those mines ourselves and thus\r\nfelt a sense of responsibility. We hope that we shall soon\r\nbe able to achieve the agreement that will allow us to\r\ncomplete that task.\r\nA lasting peace requires United Nations contingents\r\nendowed with the capacity to deploy rapidly and\r\neffectively. Accordingly, Argentina, together with other\r\ncountries, is working to improve mechanisms of\r\ndeployment. In this context, allow me also to recall that,\r\nnext year, Argentina will mark the fortieth anniversary of\r\nits participation in peacekeeping operations. That is a\r\ngreat many years.\r\nThe magnitude of the adverse consequences for\r\nindividuals of current conflicts requires us to exert our\r\nutmost efforts with regard to humanitarian assistance.\r\nSuch assistance constitutes an indispensable element in\r\npeace-building. Accordingly, the “White Helmets”\r\ninitiative has made possible a growing mobilization of\r\nhuman and financial resources, bringing about a healthy\r\nreassessment of humanitarian assistance criteria and\r\nprocedures.\r\nIn order to consolidate a lasting peace, we must not\r\nallow impunity to prevail for crimes that offend the\r\nconscience of humankind. The creation by the Security\r\nCouncil of tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and\r\nRwanda is a recognition that justice and law are\r\ninseparable components of the system of collective\r\nsecurity. Argentina firmly supports the creation of a\r\ngeneral and permanent international criminal court. We\r\ntrust that the Rome conference in 1998 will make possible\r\nthe realization of this initiative.\r\nLet me also say that the Argentine Government\r\nfirmly intends to pursue its struggle against the abusive\r\nconsumption of psychotropic substances and illicit\r\nnarcotics trafficking, as well as related offenses.\r\nIn the subregional context, we are proud that the\r\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) continues\r\nto grow in both the commercial and political spheres,\r\nwhich are interrelated, and to contribute to advancing\r\nintegration in the hemisphere. MERCOSUR is a clear\r\ncase of open regionalism. It has not resulted in the\r\ndistortion or diversion of trade but has, rather, generated\r\ntrade both between the countries of the region and with\r\ncountries outside it. Argentina, jointly with its other\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nMERCOSUR partners, is active in the formation of the\r\nAmerican Free Trade Area (AFTA). MERCOSUR has\r\nintroduced a proposal for negotiation of AFTA based on a\r\nphased approach.\r\nWith regard to regional security, Argentina has been\r\na leader in reducing residual tensions in the area. It has\r\ncontributed to the attainment of such cherished goals for the\r\nnations of South America as the resolution of border\r\nproblems in a climate of confidence with our neighbours\r\nand by promoting common positions in support of\r\nstrengthened democracy and political and economic\r\nstability. Accordingly, we have, through the Mechanism for\r\nConsultation and Concerted Political Action of the Rio\r\nGroup, been promoting the Declaration on the Defence of\r\nDemocracy, to which we attach great importance as one\r\nmore means to advance peace and security — goals that\r\ncan be achieved only with representative democracy. We\r\nalso welcome the inclusion of Bolivia and Chile as full\r\nmembers of the Mercosur Mechanism for Consultation and\r\nConcerted Political Action.\r\nWith our neighbours, friends and partners, we are\r\npursuing a deepening of the dialogue on security and\r\ndefence. We are adjusting it to the new international and\r\nregional reality, convinced that security is enhanced through\r\nintegration. Indeed, the basis of security in the Southern\r\nCone is the friendship and cordiality of its countries. In this\r\ncontext, military cooperation has increased, with positive\r\nresults for transparency and mutual confidence-building. As\r\na result of these efforts, Latin America today can point with\r\npride to the peace and harmony that prevails among its\r\nStates.\r\nThere remains, however, in the South Atlantic, an\r\nimportant unresolved issue: the question of the Malvinas\r\nIslands. I reaffirm once again the legitimate rights of the\r\nRepublic of Argentina in that dispute and its appeal for a\r\npeaceful and lasting solution.\r\nIn keeping with the repeated appeals of this General\r\nAssembly and the Decolonization Committee, we believe\r\nthat it is imperative to resume negotiations on all aspects of\r\nthe question of the Malvinas Islands. No Member of the\r\nUnited Nations should evade the obligation to resolve a\r\ndispute by peaceful means as laid down in the Charter of\r\nthis Organization. We call for the parties to sit at the\r\nnegotiating table and discuss all the relevant issues.\r\nWe have made too much progress with the United\r\nKingdom to avoid addressing this issue. We have made\r\nvery important strides in building our bilateral relationship\r\nwith the United Kingdom, which are reflected in\r\nheightened economic, commercial and cultural relations\r\nbetween the two countries. We have recreated a climate\r\nof mutual trust in the South-West Atlantic, which enables\r\nus today to cooperate in the conservation of living\r\nresources and in the exploration and exploitation of\r\nhydrocarbons. Undoubtedly, these activities would gain\r\nsubstantial impetus from the resumption of direct links\r\nbetween the mainland and the islands, which have proven\r\nto be most beneficial in the past. Nothing, however,\r\nreplaces human contact between individuals.\r\nI trust that the new British Government will heed\r\nour appeal and that of the international community to\r\npursue a dialogue without preconditions with a view to\r\nfinding a definitive solution to the sovereignty dispute\r\nover the Malvinas Islands. To the islanders, I once again\r\nreiterate our firm commitment to fully respect their way\r\nof life, culture and institutions, as stated in our national\r\nConstitution.\r\nThe Decolonization Committee, which has\r\nhistorically played a decisive role in this sphere, has\r\nshown itself to be the appropriate forum to continue\r\naddressing the situation of the Malvinas Islands and other\r\ndependent territories. Accordingly, the six countries that\r\nmake up the MERCOSUR Mechanism for Consultation\r\nand Concerted Political Action have reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of the work of the Committee of 24 on the\r\ndecolonization process, which has not yet been completed.\r\nWe trust that the Committee will maintain its\r\neffectiveness to the full.\r\nAnother fundamental issue is the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council, which in 1945 was consonant with the\r\nreality prevailing at the end of the Second World War.\r\nThat is no longer the case, however. On the eve of the\r\ntwenty-first century, we should not design a model that\r\nonly adds new discriminations to those we have inherited.\r\nThat would be a conceptual mistake. Argentina, while\r\nunderstanding the position of each Member State on this\r\nmatter, is of the view that there is not yet a general\r\nagreement concerning the increase in the number of\r\npermanent members. We all agree that the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should make it a more democratic and\r\nrepresentative body. To reach that goal, each region will\r\nneed to arrive at a compromise without being pressured\r\nor rushed.\r\nIn the case of Latin America and the Caribbean, the\r\nSummit of Heads of State of the Rio Group has agreed\r\nthat the region itself will have to decide how to fill the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nseats assigned to it. Argentina is of the view that an open-\r\nended mechanism of rotation should be established that will\r\nenable the participation of all those States that have shown\r\ntheir commitment to and respect for the Charter. This\r\nwould avoid discrimination against those States that, like\r\nArgentina, bear greater financial responsibilities. In short,\r\nthe Argentine position is aimed solely at promoting the\r\nample participation of all States of the region, without any\r\nexclusion whatsoever.\r\nI must say, however, that there is more to this matter\r\nthan the increase in the number of members. Methods of\r\nwork and procedures also need to be updated. In this\r\ncontext, I concur with the comments made by the\r\nrepresentative of New Zealand.\r\nIt is our firm conviction that reform of the United\r\nNations must necessarily be built upon two fundamental\r\npillars. First, it must respond to the requirements and\r\nexpectations of the international community. Secondly, it\r\nmust reflect a general agreement among the Member States.\r\nIt is only in this way that the Organization will retain its\r\nrelevance in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Kwamena Ahwoi,\r\nMinister Responsible for Foreign Affairs of Ghana.\r\nMr. Ahwoi (Ghana): The delegation of Ghana\r\ncongratulates His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-second session. His long experience in the affairs\r\nof this Organization and the great qualities which he brings\r\nto this high office assure us that under his wise guidance\r\nthe work of this session will be fruitful and constructive. To\r\nthat end my delegation pledges to him its full support and\r\ncooperation.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to pay a special tribute to\r\nhis distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail, who conducted the business of the fifty-first session\r\nwith remarkable zeal and efficiency. The promptitude and\r\nenergy with which he discharged his responsibilities as\r\nPresident has left an enduring imprint on the work of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nTo our distinguished Secretary-General and my\r\ncompatriot, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, we wish to\r\nexpress our deep appreciation for his sterling qualities of\r\nleadership. The people of Ghana are indeed grateful to the\r\nworld community for having chosen a son to head this very\r\nhigh and important body. Barely nine months after\r\nassuming his onerous responsibilities, Kofi Annan has\r\ndemonstrated an indefatigable energy and commitment to\r\nthe reform and efficient management of the Organization\r\nto enable it to measure up to the purposes and objectives\r\nof its existence. We pledge to him our continued\r\nunflinching support.\r\nAt the fifty-first session, Member States warmly\r\nwelcomed the conclusion of the Pelindaba and Bangkok\r\nTreaties establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa\r\nand South-East Asia respectively. We also welcomed the\r\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nwhich has since been signed by the vast majority of\r\nStates, including my own. We view these as progressive\r\nsteps on the road to nuclear disarmament. We therefore\r\nrenew our call on the nuclear-weapon States to cooperate\r\nwith the rest of the international community for the\r\ncommencement and early conclusion of multilateral\r\nnegotiations on a universal and binding convention\r\nprohibiting the development, production, stockpiling and\r\nuse of nuclear weapons, and mandating the destruction of\r\nthe existing stockpiles.\r\nWe make these appeals not as an annual ritual but\r\nbecause of our deep conviction that the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical\r\nand biological weapons, will go a long way to promote\r\ninternational peace and security, a principal purpose for\r\nwhich this Organization was established.\r\nWhile weapons of mass destruction deserve the\r\npriority attention accorded them by this Assembly, the\r\nquestion of conventional weapons cannot be ignored\r\neither. The illicit transfer and use of this category of\r\narmaments are a source of great concern, since they\r\nconstitute a threat to the stability of States and fuel the\r\nnumerous conflicts which bedevil the world today,\r\nparticularly in Africa. They also provide terrorists, drug\r\nbarons and other criminals the means with which to\r\npursue their illegal activities. We must adopt all available\r\nmeans to curb the illicit traffic. In the same vein, we\r\nsupport ongoing international initiatives to conclude a\r\ntreaty banning the production, transfer and use of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, which continue to kill and maim\r\ninnocent people and disrupt the economic and social life\r\nof millions, long after the end of the conflicts in which\r\nthey were laid.\r\nThough the end of the cold war has greatly reduced\r\nthe threat of another global war, which twice in this\r\ncentury brought untold sorrow to mankind, intra-country\r\nconflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nseveral countries, with resultant loss of lives, destruction of\r\nnational infrastructure, displacement of innocent persons\r\nand outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries. In\r\nAfghanistan, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, Somalia,\r\nAngola, Liberia and Sierra Leone and the Republic of the\r\nCongo, we see the havoc caused by this new trend and its\r\npotential threat to regional and subregional security.\r\nWe in Africa are all the more concerned. For while\r\nthe international community is prompt to react to conflicts\r\nin regions of economic or geo-strategic interest to the rich\r\nand industrialized world, conflicts in some developing\r\ncountries, particularly in Africa, I am sorry to say, fail to\r\nelicit the same degree of response. Thus, peacekeeping,\r\nwhich is a primary function of this Organization, has also\r\nfallen prey to geo-strategic parochial considerations. We\r\nhasten to warn that such double standards threaten the\r\nconcept of collective security which constitutes the very\r\nfoundation of this Organization.\r\nIn the West African subregion, we have endeavoured\r\nto fill the gap left by international inertia and selectivity.\r\nAfter nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) intervention in Liberia,\r\ncountries of the subregion, with only the limited assistance\r\nof the international community, finally succeeded in\r\nsupervising the conduct of presidential and legislative\r\nelections in the country in July 1997, under conditions\r\ngenerally acknowledged to be free and fair.\r\nWe are happy to welcome the worthy representatives\r\nof the elected Government of Liberia to this Assembly. For\r\ntrue and lasting peace in that country, we urge the\r\ninternational community to stand by the people of Liberia\r\nas they set out on the difficult road of national\r\nreconstruction. We are proud to have been part of the\r\nprocess to restore peace and legitimacy in Liberia, and pray\r\nthat the Liberian Government and people will continue on\r\nthe path of national reconciliation in order to consolidate\r\nthe hard-won peace, which is vital for social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhile we applaud the return of peace to Liberia, we\r\ndeplore the onset of violence, disorder and destruction\r\nfollowing the unjustified overthrow of the democratically\r\nelected Government of President Tejan Kabbah in Sierra\r\nLeone. We call on the leaders of the coup to heed the\r\nunequivocal condemnation of their act by the international\r\ncommunity and cooperate with the efforts of ECOWAS to\r\nrestore constitutional order in Sierra Leone.\r\nIn recent years, my delegation has had cause to\r\nexpress its concern and regret at the continued imposition\r\nof unjust sanctions on Libya by the Security Council, in\r\ndefiance of the expressed wish of the vast majority of\r\nStates represented in the League of Arab States, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. We note that Libya has fully met the\r\nrequirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992)\r\nand is willing to cooperate with the other parties\r\nconcerned in the dispute. We urge the Security Council to\r\nrevisit the issue and ensure a peaceful solution of the\r\nconflict and an end to the sanctions.\r\nWe also reiterate the call of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and other States on the United States of\r\nAmerica to put an end to the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial measures and actions unilaterally imposed on\r\nCuba, in contravention of the United Nations Charter and\r\nall principles of international law.\r\nWe urge the people of Korea to work together in\r\npeace to realize their aspirations. Since the end of the\r\ncold war peace on the peninsula has needlessly been\r\nunder threat on a number of occasions.\r\nOn the question of Western Sahara, we maintain our\r\nconfidence in the power of direct dialogue, under the\r\nauspices of this Organization, as the best means by which\r\nthe Settlement Plan can be revived to enable the Sahrawi\r\npeople to exercise their right to self-determination,\r\nthrough a free, fair and impartial referendum. The news\r\nthat the Secretary-General’s personal envoy, in the worthy\r\nperson of His Excellency Mr. James Baker III, has\r\nsucceeded in brokering a compromise agreement through\r\nsuch direct talks is reassuring, and we hope that very\r\nsoon, this long, drawn-out conflict will be amenable to\r\nsuccessful resolution.\r\nMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to\r\nexpress my Government’s regret that the Middle East\r\npeace process has been put in grave jeopardy by the\r\nactions of the Israeli Government, which, defying\r\ninternational outcry, continues its settlement activities in\r\nEast Jerusalem. For these are the very actions which\r\nencourage extremists among the Palestinians to organize\r\nterrorist acts against the Israeli population. We would also\r\nurge the Palestinian leadership to continue more\r\nassiduously in its efforts to achieve the objectives of their\r\ntreaty with Israel through non-confrontational means.\r\nMany a representative has drawn attention to the\r\ncontinued and widespread growth of the global economy\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nas we move towards the close of the century and to the\r\nbroadening of the reach of economic growth in developing\r\ncountries to include an increasing number of low-income\r\ncountries. Indeed, many African countries have achieved\r\nstronger growth of output and incomes in 1996 and 1997.\r\nThis encouraging trend has been achieved through the\r\nadoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and\r\nmeasures aimed at ensuring, among others, macroeconomic\r\nstability, inflows of foreign direct investment, open and free\r\nmarkets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory\r\nframeworks.\r\nHowever, it is pertinent also to point out that despite\r\nthese efforts, many African countries, and especially the\r\nleast developed countries, continue to face important policy\r\nchallenges, particularly in the areas of enhancing resource\r\nmobilization and allocation, strengthening savings and\r\ninvestment and financing development. The difficulties\r\ninherent in these challenges are compounded by the adverse\r\nimpact of globalization and liberalization. These countries\r\nhave not participated in, nor benefited from, globalization.\r\nOn the contrary, they have become even more marginalized\r\nin the global economy for the very simple reason that they\r\nlack the physical, financial and human resources as well as\r\nthe institutional infrastructure necessary for effective\r\ncompetition and integration in the international markets.\r\nIn specific terms our countries, despite various\r\nstructural reforms, have been unable to attract in sufficient\r\nquantities the necessary capital inflows for investment, and\r\nare confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side\r\nconstraints which limit our export potential, an\r\nunsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our\r\nnational income, and declining levels of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, among others. The “prosperity-\r\npoverty” gap, or gulf, between the haves and the have-nots\r\nis ever more yawning.\r\nUnder these circumstances, what we need is a new\r\ndevelopment strategy based on genuine partnership between\r\nthe developed and developing countries and which takes a\r\nholistic view of development, combining within itself all\r\nthe tools of development, including trade and investment as\r\nwell as official development assistance and South/South\r\ncooperation. Such a strategy will also necessitate the\r\ndemocratization of international relations, particularly in the\r\neconomic sphere; the establishment of open, equitable and\r\ntransparent international regimes; the creation of fair\r\nopportunities for all; and the protection of the weakest\r\nmembers of our community.\r\nIt is in this context that we welcome the successful\r\nconclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development,\r\nwhich is intended to serve as an initial framework for\r\nrenewing and strengthening the partnership for\r\ndevelopment on the basis of mutual benefits and genuine\r\ninterdependence. While acknowledging and affirming our\r\ncommitment to the primacy of national policies and\r\nmeasures to achieve our development goals, we wish to\r\nstress the importance of the fulfilment by all parties of the\r\nglobal commitments aimed at supplementing national\r\nefforts. In this connection, we express the hope that the\r\ncommitments and internationally agreed targets reached at\r\nrecent major United Nations conferences will be fully\r\nimplemented by all parties. It is also our view that the\r\nUnited Nations must be strengthened and adequately\r\nequipped to carry out its important role in development.\r\nIn seeking to achieve our goals, we the countries of\r\nthe developing world need to cooperate more among\r\nourselves as a means of strengthening our self-reliance\r\nand complementing international development\r\ncooperation. We therefore need to strive to enhance\r\ncooperation at all levels — bilateral, subregional, regional\r\nand interregional — in the important areas of trade,\r\ninvestment, finance, science and technology, environment,\r\nhuman resources development, and information and\r\ncommunications. This, in the view of my delegation, will\r\nconstitute an important strategy for facilitating the\r\neffective participation of developing countries in the\r\nglobal economy.\r\nThe review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nAgenda 21 last June revealed worsening trends for\r\nsustainable development, as well as the continued\r\ndeterioration of the state of the global environment as a\r\nresult of the failure of the international community to\r\nfulfil the commitments it undertook in 1992. This is a sad\r\nstate of affairs. But even sadder still was the failure of the\r\nreview session to make any significant progress on the\r\ncritical issues of Agenda 21, owing to the unwillingness\r\nof Member States to establish time-bound and quantified\r\ncommitments. It is absolutely necessary that we all\r\nrecommit ourselves to the global partnership established\r\nat Rio in 1992 and to the fulfilment of the obligations\r\nvoluntarily assumed under Agenda 21.\r\nGhana has in various forums indicated its support for\r\nthe establishment of an international criminal court. We\r\nare gratified that the Preparatory Committee for the\r\nestablishment of the Court made significant progress in\r\nthat direction at its last two sessions. We hope that with\r\nthe same determination and spirit of compromise which\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nhas characterized the work of the Preparatory Committee\r\nsince its inception, the establishment of the Court will soon\r\nbecome a reality. We wish to recognize the useful\r\ncontributions of the various non-governmental organizations\r\nwhich have worked closely with governmental delegations\r\non several difficult aspects of the proposed international\r\ncriminal court.\r\nProgress on the Law of the Sea also deserves mention.\r\nWith the establishment of the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf, all institutions envisaged by the\r\nConvention have now been put in place. It is our hope that\r\nadequate resources will be made available to these\r\ninstitutions to enable them fully to attain the objectives for\r\nwhich they were set up. It is also our hope that cooperation\r\nbetween the appropriate United Nations agencies and\r\ndeveloping countries in the sphere of the Law of the Sea\r\nwill be intensified to enable developing countries fully to\r\nutilize the benefits conferred on them by the Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea.\r\nThe critical financial situation of the Organization is\r\na major source of concern to my delegation, as it places our\r\nOrganization in jeopardy at a time of challenge and of\r\nopportunity to promote the objectives and purposes of the\r\nOrganization. It is regrettable that a number of countries,\r\nincluding some of the largest contributors, are neither\r\npaying their contributions nor making good on their arrears,\r\nwhile some even wittingly aggravate the situation by\r\nattaching unacceptable conditions or benchmarks to the\r\ndischarge of their Charter obligations in this regard. My\r\ndelegation strongly believes that support for the United\r\nNations must be demonstrated not only by an eagerness to\r\npromote reforms but more importantly by the willingness of\r\nMember States to pay all their assessed contributions\r\npromptly, fully and unconditionally to ensure that the\r\nOrganization is financially sound and can meet its mandates\r\nand other commitments.\r\nTed Turner, an individual with no obligation\r\nwhatsoever to support the United Nations, has demonstrated\r\nsupport in a dramatic and yet effective manner. He has\r\noffered to pay the United Nations $1 billion over 10 years.\r\nWhat excuse has any country got, then, to say, “We will\r\nnot pay”, or “We will pay only if ...”? On behalf of His\r\nExcellency the President of Ghana and of the people of\r\nGhana, I say thank you to Ted Turner for showing us the\r\nway, for pricking our consciences and for being such a\r\ngood citizen of the world.\r\nToday at the fifty-second session, perhaps more so\r\nthan ever before, the General Assembly is confronted with\r\nthe complex problem of the reform of our Organization.\r\nOn the threshold of a new millennium, the United Nations\r\ncannot continue to conduct its business as usual. It has to\r\nadopt bold and imaginative measures to overhaul its\r\nstructure and working methods with a view to removing\r\nthe obstacles that impede its effectiveness not only as an\r\ninstrument for promoting international peace and security\r\nbut also as an indispensable agent for resolving the\r\nworld’s socio-economic problems.\r\nIt is in this context that Ghana has carefully studied\r\nthe Secretary-General’s wide-ranging and far-reaching\r\nproposals presented to Member States for their\r\nconsideration and reaction. We warmly congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General on his bold initiative. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has thrown a momentous challenge to all of us,\r\nand we should do everything possible to measure up to\r\nthe test by manifesting the necessary breadth of vision\r\nand objectivity of outlook. The United Nations remains\r\nthe only international body available to us in our search\r\nfor peace, progress and prosperity as well as in the\r\nresolution of differences among nations.\r\nFor us as a nation, we are particularly interested in\r\nthe new sense of purpose and dynamism that the\r\nproposals seek to inject into United Nations development\r\nactivities to make them more coherent and output-\r\noriented. We support the setting up of an effective\r\nmachinery to study the various proposals and how to\r\nimplement them, and we stand ready to participate in any\r\nsuch effort.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on Her Excellency Mrs. Lena Hjelm-Wallén,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.\r\nMrs. Hjelm-Wallén (Sweden): I sincerely\r\ncongratulate the Foreign Minister of Ukraine,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly, a most crucial task\r\nwhich I trust he will execute in a most productive and\r\ncreative manner.\r\nLet me also record my admiration and praise for the\r\nway in which his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail,\r\nperformed his demanding mission during the whole of the\r\nfifty-first session of the General Assembly. He laid a\r\nunique foundation on the basis of which we must now\r\nmake advances towards a better United Nations.\r\nI refer to the statement made yesterday by the\r\nForeign Minister of Luxembourg on behalf of all\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nmembers of the European Union; my Government fully\r\nsubscribes to that statement.\r\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, profound\r\nchanges are affecting the lives of nations and individuals.\r\nMany are benefitting from open international relations.\r\nOthers feel marginalized politically and economically. And\r\nall too many countries are still threatened by persistent\r\npoverty, social injustice and domestic strife.\r\nWe need a strong United Nations to counter these\r\nforces, which separate nations and tear them apart. We need\r\na renewed United Nations to focus on the tasks for which\r\nit was established, and to meet the new challenges of today\r\nand of tomorrow.\r\nThis is why we need fundamental United Nations\r\nreform: not piecemeal improvements, but major change.\r\nThis is why Sweden wholeheartedly endorses the reform\r\nproposals presented by the Secretary-General. We give our\r\nsupport as an active participant in all spheres of United\r\nNations activity and as a major contributor to its\r\ndevelopment funds and programmes.\r\nUnited Nations reform is not a cost-cutting exercise.\r\nIts aim must be to make the Organization strong, effective\r\nand efficient, focusing on its core activities and ready to\r\nmeet its future challenges. The Swedish Government\r\nsupports the proposal that efficiency savings should be used\r\nfor development.\r\nThe United Nations cannot be reformed under the\r\nthreat of political and financial crisis. It is simply not\r\nacceptable that Member States should set conditions for\r\nfulfilling Charter obligations. The Swedish Government\r\nurges all debtors — including the main debtor, the United\r\nStates — to settle their accounts before the end of this year\r\nand to pay their assessed contributions in full, on time and\r\nwithout conditions.\r\nSecuring a sound and viable financial basis must be an\r\nintegral part of reform efforts. The idea of establishing a\r\nrevolving credit fund could be considered as an emergency\r\nstep. We should also enact measures to reverse the current\r\ntrend of late payment. Article 19 of the Charter should be\r\napplied more strictly. It is also time to agree on a new scale\r\nof assessments based on capacity to pay. A realistic\r\nproposal has been presented by the European Union.\r\nWe, the Member States, should provide political\r\ndirection for the reform process. We should take an overall\r\nview of United Nations reform, and avoid getting trapped\r\nin details. We are fully aware that there will be further\r\nsteps: reform is a process, not a one-time event.\r\nToday, I will emphasize the need to strengthen and\r\nreform the United Nations in four key areas: peace and\r\nsecurity, sustainable development, human rights, and\r\ndisarmament.\r\nFirst, the United Nations must be strengthened and\r\nreformed to effectively prevent and settle armed conflicts.\r\nThis is the purpose for which the Organization was\r\nestablished. This is where success or failure will\r\nultimately be determined. Long-term prevention should\r\naddress the root causes of conflict: poverty, social\r\ninjustice, oppression and violations of human rights. The\r\nUnited Nations world conferences have established the\r\nclose relationship between security and development. The\r\nUnited Nations must continue to build on this political\r\nplatform.\r\nConflict prevention is a task which requires\r\ncoordinated action by the United Nations system as a\r\nwhole, including the international financial organizations,\r\nand also by non-governmental organizations. Cooperation\r\nat the regional and subregional levels is increasingly\r\nimportant for building a security environment based on\r\ncommon values and norms.\r\nIt is equally urgent to strengthen the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to act on the threat of an erupting conflict.\r\nThe whole range of United Nations instruments, including\r\nthose mentioned in Article 33 of the Charter, should be\r\ndeveloped and used to their full potential. Sweden wishes\r\nto cooperate with other Member States to enhance the\r\nUnited Nations capacity for early warning and early\r\naction. The new generation of peacekeeping operations\r\nmust combine political, military, humanitarian and civilian\r\nUnited Nations action, and strike the right balance\r\nbetween various forms of response. The United Nations\r\nHumanitarian Coordinator plays a key role in fostering a\r\nresponse to humanitarian crises. This should lay the\r\ngroundwork for post-conflict reconstruction and long-term\r\nrecovery of war-torn nations.\r\nThe Swedish Government supports efforts to set up\r\na rapidly deployable mission headquarters within the\r\nUnited Nations. Together with Austria, Canada, Denmark\r\nand Norway, we are creating the multinational Stand-by\r\nForces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG) to enhance\r\nthe United Nations capacity for rapid deployment. In\r\nmany situations United Nations civilian police can help\r\nprevent conflict and restore ravaged societies. I therefore\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nappreciated the opportunity I had, during Sweden’s\r\npresidency of the Security Council in July, to deliver a\r\npresidential statement on civilian police in peacekeeping\r\noperations. It calls on Member States to make qualified\r\npolice quickly available to the United Nations through\r\nbetter and standardized training.\r\nWe need a global security architecture: a web of\r\norganizations capable of dealing quickly with a wide range\r\nof threats and potential conflicts. Regional organizations\r\nwill further gain in importance. But the primary and overall\r\nresponsibility remains with the United Nations. Conflict\r\nprevention, peacekeeping, peace-building and humanitarian\r\naction to protect the victims of conflicts have to be at the\r\ncore of United Nations reform efforts. But the decisive\r\nfactor will not be the instruments with which we equip the\r\nOrganization, but rather our willingness to use them, to pay\r\nfor them and to accept the authority of the United Nations.\r\nMy second theme is that the United Nations must be\r\nstrengthened and reformed to combat poverty and promote\r\nsustainable development. Fighting poverty, supporting\r\nsustainable development and promoting economic\r\nintegration are part of the Organization’s mandate as set out\r\nin the Charter. Sweden sees this crucial task as being in its\r\nown best interest. Our own development has benefited\r\nmuch from the multilateralism of this century.\r\nThe Swedish Government wholeheartedly supports the\r\nproposals of the Secretary-General to reform the United\r\nNations in the economic and social fields. We want an\r\nempowered and capable United Nations. We want a unified\r\nUnited Nations presence in the field so that the United\r\nNations system can be a reliable and flexible partner for\r\ndeveloping countries. We want long-term commitments\r\nfrom donors and more equitable burden-sharing for\r\nfinancing development.\r\nSweden is one of the four countries fulfilling the\r\nUnited Nations aid target. Over a three-year period, by the\r\nyear 2000, we undertake to further increase our aid budget,\r\nchallenging the international trend. In spite of a few\r\ndifficult years, we have kept up our voluntary contributions\r\nto the multilateral system. In the coming years we foresee\r\nincreases. To support debt relief for the poorest countries\r\nthe Swedish Government will contribute 295 million\r\nSwedish Krona to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\r\nand World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity in the coming years will be to achieve global\r\nsustainable development. The industrialized countries\r\nmust take the lead and learn how to do more with less\r\ninput of resources and energy. Our goal should be to use\r\nenergy and raw materials 10 times more efficiently. In\r\nour efforts to combat climate change, the developed\r\ncountries should, this December in Kyoto, agree to reduce\r\nthe emission of greenhouse gases.\r\nMy third theme is that the United Nations must be\r\nstrengthened and reformed to protect and promote human\r\nrights. Sweden applauds the Secretary-General’s steps to\r\nintegrate human rights into all United Nations activities.\r\nWe welcome the appointment of the distinguished Mrs\r\nMary Robinson as High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nNext year the United Nations will celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. This historic document establishes the individual\r\nas a subject in international relations, with her or his own\r\nrights and aspirations. Violations of human rights are a\r\nlegitimate concern for the international community.\r\nThe Human Rights Year 1998 will be an opportunity\r\nfor celebration, but also for critical assessment. We\r\nshould reform human rights machinery and strengthen\r\nassistance in this field. The implementation of\r\ninternational human rights standards must be improved.\r\nPublic information and fact-finding on human rights\r\nviolations are crucial. It is particularly important to\r\nexpose any attempt by Governments to silence those who\r\nbravely stand up in defence of human rights and basic\r\nhumanitarian principles in their own countries.\r\nSweden will continue to work hard to combat\r\ntorture. We will stand firm in our rejection of the death\r\npenalty, wherever practised. It is an abhorrent practice,\r\nunworthy of our times.\r\nCooperation must be enhanced to eradicate sexual\r\nabuse, exploitation and trafficking in children and women.\r\nGovernments need to take firm action against\r\ndiscrimination based on gender, ethnic origin or religious\r\nbelief.\r\nNext year’s diplomatic conference will be a\r\nmilestone in the decades-long endeavour to establish an\r\ninternational criminal court. The court will play a crucial\r\nrole in closing the gap of impunity for those who commit\r\ngenocide, serious war crimes and systematic or large-scale\r\nhuman rights violations.\r\nMy fourth and last theme is that the United Nations\r\nmust be strengthened and reformed to build security\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nthrough disarmament. Disarmament, non-proliferation and\r\narms control are central features of any policy aimed at\r\npreventing conflict, promoting peace and fostering\r\neconomic and social development. They must become fully\r\nintegrated elements in a coordinated policy for peace-\r\nbuilding.\r\nThe 1990s have seen impressive progress towards\r\ndisarmament, but much work lies ahead. The international\r\npolitical and security climate now offers a historic\r\nopportunity. It must be fully translated into concrete\r\nactions.\r\nIt is imperative that the quest for a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree world continue. Sweden urges the Russian Federation\r\nto ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks II (START II),\r\nenabling the conclusion of START III. This should pave the\r\nway for further reductions, on the part of all nuclear-\r\nweapon States, with a view to the total elimination of\r\nnuclear arsenals, in accordance with Article VI of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT).\r\nThe Canberra Commission on the Elimination of\r\nNuclear Weapons has proposed a series of measures to\r\nachieve a world free from nuclear weapons. Its report\r\nmerits in-depth consideration in international disarmament\r\nforums. Let me focus on two timely aspects.\r\nThe Commission proposes that nuclear forces should\r\nbe taken off alert and that warheads be removed from their\r\ndelivery vehicles. I urge the United States and Russia to\r\napply these measures without delay to all strategic weapons\r\ncovered by START II, and subsequently by START III.\r\nNuclear-weapon-free States have a legitimate right to\r\nassurances that they will not be attacked or threatened by\r\nnuclear weapons. The time has come to elaborate a legally\r\nbinding instrument under the NPT, giving such assurances\r\nto non-nuclear-weapon States Parties.\r\nConventional arms — especially light weaponry — are\r\nat the heart of today’s conflicts. They aggravate tensions,\r\nprovoke and prolong wars and inflict human suffering —\r\nsometimes long after ceasefires and peace settlements. The\r\nflow of conventional arms to areas of tension and conflict\r\nmust be stemmed. I welcome the high priority given to\r\nsuch objectives in the Secretary-General’s reform\r\nprogramme. There is a need for export control of\r\nconventional arms as well as of dual-use products.\r\nInternational cooperation in this field and the demand for an\r\ninternational code of conduct for arms transfers are matters\r\nof high priority for the Swedish Government.\r\nFrom a humanitarian point of view, anti-personnel\r\nlandmines are in a category of their own: indiscriminate\r\nby nature, crippling innocent children, women, men and\r\nnations. I am proud to say that Sweden was the first State\r\nto propose a total ban on this terrible type of weapon. I\r\nwarmly welcome the Oslo agreement on a convention on\r\nsuch a ban. I urge all States to accede to it. We must now\r\nmake every effort to achieve universal adherence to this\r\nban.\r\nReform is necessary to build a stronger and more\r\nrelevant United Nations. I have outlined some major\r\naspects from Sweden’s point of view. As I have\r\nemphasized, but must not look at United Nations reform\r\nin isolation, we must consider why we need the\r\nOrganization and what it can do for all of us through all\r\nof us.\r\nToday’s international environment is rife with\r\ncontradictions. We have a globalized economy, but we\r\nalso have a periphery unable to benefit, and left further\r\nand further behind. We have ever closer international\r\ncooperation, but we also have aggressive nationalism and\r\nxenophobia. We have growing support for democracy and\r\nhuman rights, but we also have atrocities and blatant\r\ndisregard for international law.\r\nIn this situation, the purpose of the United Nations\r\nshould be precisely what is spelled out in its name and its\r\nCharter: to unite nations and people.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Dominican Republic, His Excellency Mr. Eduardo\r\nLatorre. I give him the floor.\r\nMr. Latorre (Dominican Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): On behalf of the Dominican Republic and\r\nits President Mr. Leonel Fernandez Reyna, I wish to\r\nconvey to our President our warmest congratulations on\r\nhis well deserved election to preside over this fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly, at a time when the\r\nOrganization is taking important steps forward in its re-\r\nstructuring and modernization in order to meet the\r\nchallenges of peace and economic and social development\r\nfor our nations.\r\nOur delegation pays tribute to the outgoing\r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, for his\r\noutstanding conduct of the deliberations during the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his assiduity,\r\ndedication and hard work in guiding the Organization down\r\na road of reform and modernization that will make it\r\nstronger for the new millennium.\r\nWhile remaining faithful to the purposes and principles\r\nset forth in the Charter — the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, cooperation for economic, social and\r\ncultural development, defence of human rights, and\r\nhumanitarian assistance — the United Nations should also\r\npromote and pursue a reform process which takes into\r\naccount the many changes that have taken place in a\r\ncomplex international scene. That scene is marked by the\r\nend of ideological confrontations and, at the same time, by\r\nincreasing levels of poverty and ethnic and religious\r\ntension, phenomena that pose a threat to our supreme\r\nobjectives of peace and development for our peoples.\r\nThe trend within the Organization in recent years to\r\nthe establishment of working groups, as well as the report\r\nof the Secretary-General entitled “Renewing the United\r\nNations: A Programme for Reform”, reflect the strong\r\nresolve of Member States to engage in a negotiation and\r\nconsultation process that could, once their distrust of the\r\npast is overcome, culminate in far-reaching changes in the\r\nvarious United Nations bodies. The Dominican Republic\r\nattaches special importance to the ongoing reform process,\r\ngiven that it is capable, while respecting the principles and\r\npurposes that gave birth to the Organization, of ensuring a\r\nmore democratic, transparent, representative and efficient\r\nsystem capable of facing the current challenges, especially\r\nthose of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nIn this regard, the strengthening of the General\r\nAssembly, the main forum in which Member States are\r\nrepresented, cannot be postponed. It is imperative to\r\npromote a process of better coordination between the\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, so that the Assembly\r\ncan be properly informed, and hence make better\r\nrecommendations to the Security Council.\r\nAware of the need to strengthen the United Nations,\r\nthe Dominican Republic calls on this forum to adopt\r\nresolutions that can return to the Assembly its capacity as\r\nthe governing body of the Organization. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the proposals of the Secretary-General designed to\r\nfocus the work of the Assembly on the highest-priority\r\nissues and to reduce the duration of its sessions as well as\r\nthe number of agenda items, so as to allow for their in-\r\ndepth study.\r\nThis reorientation should not interfere with the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality, nor with the plural and\r\nuniversal character that the Organization has maintained\r\nover the more than half a century of its existence.\r\nReaffirmation of the democratic principles contained in\r\nthe Charter must constitute the basis for the current\r\nreform process.\r\nThe Dominican Republic proposes the establishment\r\nof mechanisms and working methods that would enable\r\nthe Assembly to allow reasonable time for making\r\nprogress on resolving certain conflicts. The problems of\r\npeace, security and development are multiple and\r\ncomplex. However, the commitment of the international\r\ncommunity expressed in the United Nations should go\r\nbeyond merely recalling them each year.\r\nThe aspect of the reform of the Organization that has\r\nraised the greatest debate is the one relating to the\r\nrestructuring and enlargement of the Security Council.\r\nOur country hopes that these reforms will promote greater\r\nparticipation by the membership as a whole. Thus, with\r\na more democratic base and a just and equitable selection\r\nprocess, the Council would be in a better position to meet\r\nits purposes and objectives. In this regard, the Dominican\r\nRepublic proposes the expansion of the Security Council\r\nfrom the current 15 to 25 members. This represents less\r\nthan 14 per cent of the total number of United Nations\r\nMember States, whereas in 1945 the figure was slightly\r\nabove 20 per cent.\r\nThe Dominican Republic, a founding member of the\r\nUnited Nations, has not yet been a member of the\r\nSecurity Council. In this new phase of its international\r\nrelations it has a strong interest in participating actively\r\nin bodies such as the Security Council and thus making\r\na direct contribution to the maintenance of peace, on\r\nwhich depends the very existence of nations.\r\nAn encouraging sign in the proposal of the\r\nSecretary-General is that the reforms are constantly\r\nrelated to the achievement of the founding principles of\r\nthe Organization, as expressed in the Charter. Thus, the\r\nresults of reform will be assessed primarily not on the\r\nbasis of the relationship of costs to benefits, but rather on\r\nhow they facilitate the realization of the Organization’s\r\nobjectives.\r\nOur country supports the restructuring of the\r\nOrganization as long as it promotes more transparent,\r\nclearer and more coherent mandates and is directed\r\ntowards finding lasting solutions to the problems of\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nhunger, underdevelopment, extreme poverty and social\r\ninjustice, not forgetting the mandates related to\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nAllow me to refer to the issue of development. The\r\nincrease in global poverty and the gap between rich and\r\npoor countries is today the crucial problem for the\r\ninternational community. Poverty has a negative impact on\r\nprogress with regard to peace and security, human rights\r\nand the strengthening of democratic systems. We must\r\naddress forthwith the challenge posed by the tremendous\r\neconomic and social instability of a large number of\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Dominican delegation associates itself with the\r\ndeclarations of the Group of 77 adopted in July of this year,\r\nat the twenty-second meeting of the group coordinators,\r\nbecause we support strengthening the role of the United\r\nNations in promoting international cooperation for social\r\nand economic development. And we are in favour of\r\nmeasures that will promote the formulation and\r\ncoordination of policies and the provision of technical\r\nassistance to developing countries.\r\nOur country is making serious efforts to position itself\r\nfavourably in the world economy and to prepare for\r\nglobalization. For this purpose, it is currently conducting\r\nmajor economic, monetary, tariff and judicial reforms,\r\nwhile at the same time negotiating free-trade agreements\r\nwith countries of the region. Also, together with other\r\ncountries, it is formulating strategies to take advantage of\r\nfunds from multilateral sources.\r\nThe achievements of regional groups such as the\r\nCentral American Common Market, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM), the Andean Group and the\r\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), among\r\nothers, are indications of the strong willingness of the\r\nMember States to expand their capacities and reduce the\r\nnegative impact that the new rules of international trade\r\nhave on our economies and societies.\r\nAware of the commitment to promote at the regional\r\nlevel mechanisms for improving economic growth and\r\ncombating poverty, the Dominican Republic has in the past\r\nyear strengthened its relations with the countries of\r\nCARICOM and Central America, primarily through the\r\nparticipation of our President in the meetings of heads of\r\nState and Government. We are pleased to announce that our\r\ncountry will host the next summit meeting of Central\r\nAmerica, Belize and the Dominican Republic and that\r\nnegotiations for the establishment of a free-trade area\r\nbetween CARICOM and the Dominican Republic should\r\nbe concluded by the end of this year.\r\nAt this time allow me to welcome very\r\nenthusiastically the initiatives of the group of Central\r\nAmerican countries designed to strengthen Central\r\nAmerican unity. It is precisely these efforts that have\r\ngiven us faith and confidence in the future of our peoples.\r\nDuring this year, the Dominican Republic has\r\ndeveloped a programme for strengthening our links with\r\nour neighbouring country, Haiti. For the first time, bi-\r\nnational joint commissions are crossing the border to find,\r\nthrough dialogue, areas of mutual interest and solutions to\r\nsome of the problems common to both countries.\r\nRegarding our sister Republic of Haiti, we insist on\r\nthe need for the international community to discharge\r\neffectively the economic commitment it made in 1994\r\nwith regard to Haiti’s economic recovery and\r\ndevelopment. The peacekeeping efforts in Haiti, which we\r\nhave promoted in the United Nations, will not be\r\nsufficient to achieve democratic stability unless they are\r\naccompanied by resources directed to alleviating the great\r\neconomic and social problems affecting that nation.\r\nWe must again emphasize how external debt is\r\nweighing down our economies. The onerous costs of\r\ndebt-servicing hinder our investing more in our peoples,\r\nthus deepening the levels of poverty. For the Dominican\r\nRepublic, the payment of outstanding debts and the\r\ninterest on them represents nearly 20 per cent of the\r\nnational budget. As a means of promoting development\r\nand social investment projects to combat poverty, we wish\r\nto propose to this Assembly that it take the necessary\r\nactions to reduce the burden of the external debt in those\r\ndeveloping countries that have demonstrated a high level\r\nof responsibility in handling their debt.\r\nWe reiterate the commitment of the United Nations\r\nto develop efficient measures for the struggle against\r\npoverty. Along with peacekeeping, development\r\ncooperation must constitute an overarching goal of the\r\nOrganization. No financing of activities for peacekeeping,\r\nthe defence of human rights or humanitarian actions will\r\nbe sufficient if we do not act responsibly in undertaking\r\nmultilateral cooperation for development.\r\nThe proposal to unify the various programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations devoted to development seems to us to be\r\na very important step towards the effective coordination\r\nof intersectoral policies, concentrating strategies and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\ndevelopment operations in a United Nations Development\r\nGroup. These initiatives must reorient resources toward\r\nareas of priority and achieve better coordination with\r\ninternational funding organizations.\r\nAllow me to express the position of my country\r\nregarding the evolution of the international situation. Peace\r\nis still among the highest aspiration of our peoples.\r\nDifferent points of the planet are currently involved in\r\nbloody conflicts which affect common citizens. Security is\r\ntoday not only a matter of the survival of political regimes,\r\nbut is linked to the very existence of human beings and\r\nnature.\r\nThe Dominican Republic expresses its solidarity with\r\nthe many conventions of the international community\r\ndevoted to eradicating corruption, terrorism, drug trafficking\r\nand money laundering. These evils disrupt the lives of our\r\npeoples, erode our institutions and prevent the strengthening\r\nof democracy.\r\nWe reiterate our conviction regarding the defence of\r\ndemocratic principles and institutionality. In this regard, my\r\ncountry is making tremendous efforts to reform and\r\nmodernize the State and the judicial system. Establishing\r\nmeans of promoting a transparent public administration,\r\ncontrolling all forms of administrative corruption, is among\r\nthe ongoing processes in our nation. Dialogue and the\r\nsearch for consensus among the branches of the State and\r\nbetween the executive branch and civil society have become\r\nthe polestar of public administration of the Dominican\r\nGovernment.\r\nThe Dominican Republic welcomes and associates\r\nitself with the measures taken by the United Nations to\r\nextend the presence of the peacekeeping forces in Haiti.\r\nTheir presence, we believe, strengthens the possibilities for\r\ndemocratic stability and will allow the people to take sure\r\nsteps on the road towards consolidating the country’s\r\ndemocracy.\r\nWe stress the need for a definitive and peaceful\r\nsolution to the conflict in the Balkans, and we call upon the\r\ninternational community to strengthen its efforts to achieve\r\npeace in the Middle East. The crisis in that region, which\r\nhas deteriorated in recent months, demands special\r\nattention. We call for respect for all the agreements signed\r\nin recent years in order to restore peace in the region.\r\nWith regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan, the\r\nDominican Republic reiterates its position as presented by\r\nour President, Dr. Leonel Fernandez Reyna, regarding the\r\nneed for the international community to consider the\r\nimportance of that country, owing to its geographical\r\nlocation and given the fact that security and stability are\r\nof great significance for the peace and prosperity of the\r\nregion. We call for a constructive dialogue between the\r\ntwo sides of the Strait of Taiwan in search of mutual\r\nunderstanding and cooperation. We reiterate that parallel\r\nparticipation of both countries in the United Nations\r\nwould contribute to the maintenance of peace.\r\nOur country supports the efforts under way in\r\nvarious international conferences in Brussels, Oslo, and\r\nvery soon in Ottawa, regarding the process to achieve a\r\ntotal ban an anti-personnel landmines. The commitment\r\nto peace is a commitment to life. The international\r\ncommunity has an obligation to promote peace and to\r\ndefend life in all situations and circumstances.\r\nThe Dominican Republic, traditionally a peace-\r\noriented nation, does not produce or consume nuclear\r\nenergy for military purposes; it utilizes such energy for\r\npeaceful purposes. In this spirit, the Dominican President\r\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nduring his visit to the United Nations last year.\r\nVarious international conferences are currently\r\ndiscussing conventions on the use of nuclear energy. One\r\nof them is the convention to regulate the harm caused to\r\npersons and the environment by radioactive waste. The\r\nDominican Republic depends to a large extent on tourism,\r\na tourism of beaches and sun. The quality of our coastal\r\nwaters is vital for the sector’s development, and any\r\ninternational radioactivity-related damage can mean the\r\ncollapse of this important sector of our economy. We\r\nappeal to the good judgement of the international\r\ncommunity to preserve our natural resources.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the protection of the\r\nenvironment and natural resources. In this spirit, our\r\ncountry has acceded to the United Nations International\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification.\r\nThe Dominican Republic reiterates its commitment\r\nto defending and protecting human rights. In this\r\nconnection, it welcomes the efforts made by the United\r\nNations to concentrate the activities of the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\r\nHuman Rights. During this year we have had the\r\nsatisfaction of receiving two international missions on\r\nhuman rights, invited by our Government. A High-Level\r\nMission of the Inter-American Committee on Human\r\nRights (ICHR), of the Organization of American States,\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nvisited the country in June, and a mission of the Committee\r\nof the International Covenant on Economic, Social and\r\nCultural Rights of the United Nations, with headquarters in\r\nGeneva, is in the country at this very moment. These visits\r\nindicate the Government’s interest in ensuring transparency\r\nof action to defend and protect human rights in the\r\nDominican Republic.\r\nAllow me to refer to the situation of the United\r\nNations International Research and Training Institute for the\r\nAdvancement of Women. Our country wishes to reiterate\r\nthe mandate given in Economic and Social Council\r\nresolution 1979/11 of 9 May 1979, in which it is clearly\r\nand explicitly stated that the headquarters of the Institute\r\nwould be established in the Dominican Republic, a\r\ndeveloping country.\r\nThe objectives that led to the creation of the Institute\r\nare still valid today. Research and training for the purpose\r\nof creating new ways for women to contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of their countries, in the light of women’s\r\nneeds, are a priority. This concern was manifested at the\r\nBeijing Conference of 1995 and in the Platform for Action\r\nto follow up the agreements reached in that important\r\nforum.\r\nIn order to cooperate with the United Nations, the\r\nDominican Government not only donated the building\r\nhousing the Institute but also invested large amounts of\r\nmoney to renovate the building and adapt it to the\r\nInstitute’s needs. This explains our surprise when, in 1993,\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat proposed the merger of the\r\nInstitute and the United Nations Development Fund for\r\nWomen (UNIFEM), without prior consultation with our\r\nGovernment and ignoring the headquarters agreement.\r\nHowever, in 1995 the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen, in its Beijing Platform for Action, confirmed the\r\nInstitute’s mandate.\r\nWe hope that in the process of United Nations reform\r\nall the mandates approved by the Member States will be\r\nequally respected, since these States bear sole responsibility\r\nfor renewing or changing decisions adopted by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nLastly, we welcome the summoning of Member States\r\nto reflect on and endorse these transformations in our world\r\nOrganization. The Assembly of the millennium proposed to\r\nus for the year 2000 would be an unprecedented forum for\r\nevaluating what we have done on the road to these reforms\r\nand for reiterating our tremendous faith and trust in the\r\nfuture of the generations of the twenty-first century.\r\nAt this fifty-second session of the General Assembly\r\nwe are faced with the historic responsibility of giving\r\ngreater reality to our hopes and expectations for a better\r\nfuture for humankind. The changes in those realities are\r\ntaking place faster than the changes in the structures we\r\nhave given ourselves for dealing with them. We have a\r\nunique opportunity to ensure that the reforms of the\r\nOrganization respond to the expectations of a United\r\nNations that is in line with the needs of the new age.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Venancio de Moura.\r\nMr. de Moura (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): On behalf of the\r\nRepublic of Angola, allow me first to congratulate the\r\nPresident, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on his election to\r\npreside over the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate the outgoing\r\nPresident, Ambassador Razali Ismail, on the excellent\r\nwork he performed.\r\nWe should also like to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication\r\nand determination in turning the United Nations into a\r\nmore effective instrument to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe cold war, which was the main obstacle that for\r\ndecades prevented the United Nations from performing its\r\nrole fully, a role defined by its founding Members in the\r\nCharter, is now a thing of the past. But our world\r\nOrganization has not yet achieved the degree of efficiency\r\nthat the Member countries and their people would desire,\r\nwith the result that sometimes despair and a lack of\r\nconfidence are felt, instead of trust in its efforts.\r\nThe construction of the new democratic world order\r\nto which we all aspire will demand that the principal\r\nforum for multilateral diplomacy, the United Nations, play\r\na greater role. In this context, the complete restructuring\r\nand revitalization of its system and an end to the present\r\nfinancial crisis, which is affecting its normal functioning,\r\nare essential.\r\nThe issue of the restructuring of the Security Council\r\nshould therefore be given priority. The current structure\r\nof that body is obsolete, reflecting a reality that prevailed\r\nmore than 50 years ago. How is it conceivable that\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nregions such as the African continent, which makes up the\r\nlargest regional group at the United Nations, or Latin\r\nAmerica, are not represented among the permanent\r\nMembers of the Security Council? Therefore, it is high time\r\nthat the geographical composition of that body be\r\noverhauled to allow for more balanced and more equitable\r\nrepresentation. In this regard, Angola endorses the African\r\nclaim for no fewer than two seats among the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. The Council’s working\r\nmethods should also be revised in order to ensure greater\r\ntransparency in its decision-making processes.\r\nAngola supports the declaration made by the Heads of\r\nState of the Organization of African Unity, as well as the\r\nstatement made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nnon-aligned countries on reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe recent proposals made by the Secretary-General\r\non reform will certainly boost the process of overhauling\r\nthe United Nations. Angola welcomes the contents of those\r\nproposals, although we would have preferred to see further\r\nimprovements in some aspects. We are, however, optimistic\r\nas to the outcome.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the Lusaka Protocol which\r\nwas signed in 1994 between the Government and the armed\r\nopposition, UNITA, was intended to solve the post-electoral\r\ncrisis provoked by UNITA and at the same time to put the\r\ncountry back on the path towards peace, national\r\nreconciliation and democracy. However, approximately\r\nthree years since the beginning of its implementation,\r\nAngola is still far from achieving those goals due to the\r\nsystematic failures by UNITA to meet its obligations and to\r\nits repeated delaying tactics. This is a clear demonstration\r\nof bad faith and lack of political will by its leadership. It\r\nappears that the leader of this organization has not\r\nabandoned its strategy of taking power by force. He is still\r\nresisting the transformation of UNITA into a true political\r\nparty and UNITA’s complete demilitarization, even though\r\nthe single national army, which includes in its ranks\r\nthousands of men provided by UNITA, has already been\r\nformed.\r\nUNITA still maintains a private, heavily armed army\r\nmade up of around 35,000 men, 4,000 of whom belong to\r\nthe UNITA leader’s personal guard. This constitutes a\r\nserious violation of the Lusaka Protocol and is the main\r\ncause of the current climate of tension and insecurity in\r\nsome parts of Angola. The members of this army include\r\ntroops that UNITA hid from the United Nations during the\r\nquartering process, recently demobilized UNITA troops\r\nwho have been recruited again by force, and former\r\nsoldiers of the former Republic of Zaire.\r\nAt the same time, UNITA is still continuing its\r\nmilitary build-up through the reactivation of military\r\nbases and acquisition of sophisticated weapons from\r\nforeign countries, in clear contradiction of paragraph 19\r\nof Security Council resolution 864 (1993).\r\nOn the other hand, UNITA is holding on to large\r\nportions of national territory which were supposed to be\r\nhanded over to government administration. This is\r\nimpeding exercise of the State’s sovereignty throughout\r\nthe country and the free movement of people and goods.\r\nThe control of some of these areas is aimed at exploring\r\nfor, and then smuggling and exploiting, their natural\r\nresources to finance UNITA’s war machinery and satisfy\r\nthe individual interests of its leadership.\r\nAs a result of these actions, the perspectives created\r\nwith the inauguration of the Government of National\r\nUnity and Reconciliation and the swearing-in of the\r\nParliament have been postponed.\r\nUNITA’s behaviour in the peace process is\r\nrepugnant as well as ambiguous. It insists on armed\r\nopposition despite the fact that it is part of the main\r\npower institutions and despite the fact that Angola has a\r\ndemocratic, pluralist system in which all political parties\r\ncan freely carry out their activities.\r\nThe international community has already expressed,\r\nrepeatedly and categorically, its condemnation of and\r\ndismay at UNITA’s actions. In 1993 the Security Council\r\napplied the first package of restrictive measures against\r\nUNITA. More recently, the Security Council unanimously\r\nadopted resolution 1127 (1997), which applies a new\r\npackage of measures against UNITA as a result of its lack\r\nof cooperation in the implementation of the Lusaka\r\nProtocol. The position taken by the Council above all\r\ndisplays the concern of the international community and\r\nits determination to prevent the UNITA leadership\r\nstrategy from being implemented. Otherwise, peace and\r\nstability in Angola and the entire region of central and\r\nsouthern Africa would be at risk.\r\nThe Government of Angola reiterates its firm\r\nsupport for resolution 1127 (1997), because we feel that\r\nit is a strong means of pressure aimed at dissuading\r\nUNITA from its intention to return to war, encouraging\r\nit to speed up its demilitarization and transformation into\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\na political party, and put an end to its jurisdiction over parts\r\nof Angolan territory.\r\nTaking the above into account, the Angolan people\r\nlook forward to the Security Council’s demonstrating\r\nfirmness and determination in implementing resolution 1127\r\n(1997), immediately putting into force sanctions against\r\nUNITA unless that organization changes its behaviour and\r\ngives proof of good faith in complying with its outstanding\r\nobligations.\r\nThe Government of Angola is optimistic about the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the peace process and will\r\ncontinue to do its utmost to guarantee the full\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nBefore turning to another subject, I would like to\r\nexpress the sincerest gratitude of the Government of Angola\r\nto the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nAngola, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, and to the\r\nGovernments of the troika of observers, Portugal, Russia\r\nand the United States, for their untiring efforts to bring\r\nabout peace in Angola.\r\nRecent changes in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo have contributed to alleviating the tensions in the\r\ncentral African region, opening new perspectives for its\r\nStates and peoples in terms of stability and development.\r\nThe present climate will allow stability to prevail in\r\nthe region and will allow for better coordination among\r\nStates with a view to reinforcing the observance of the\r\nprinciple of good neighbourliness.\r\nThe Angolan Government is very apprehensive\r\nregarding the crisis in the Republic of the Congo, a country\r\nwith which Angola shares a common border, close\r\nconsanguinity and historic ties.\r\nThe Republic of Angola favours a negotiated solution\r\nto the crisis and supports the international mediation efforts\r\nheaded by Mr. Omar Bongo, President of the Republic of\r\nGabon. Our Government also supports the deployment of\r\nan international force as soon as a political settlement\r\nemerges from the negotiations.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, we deplore the interruption of the\r\ndemocratic process and the overthrow of the legitimately\r\nelected institutions. The Government of Angola supports the\r\nefforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and, in\r\nparticular, of neighbouring countries to restore the\r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nWe are also concerned with the situation in the\r\nRepublic of the Comoros, where tensions are threatening\r\nthe country’s independence and territorial integrity. We\r\nencourage the international community to support the\r\nefforts of the OAU in the search for a peaceful solution\r\nable to preserve the territorial integrity and independence\r\nof that country.\r\nThe situation in Somalia continues to deteriorate, and\r\na solution acceptable to all the parties concerned has yet\r\nto be found. The Angolan Government approves of the\r\nefforts made by member countries of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nand, in particular, the most recent initiatives of Ethiopia\r\nin bringing the representatives of the Somali factions\r\ntogether at the negotiating table.\r\nOf particular concern to us is the ostracism displayed\r\nin the main international forums with regard to the Somali\r\ncrisis.\r\nIn Western Sahara the recent opening of direct\r\nnegotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the\r\nFrente POLISARIO front is a positive sign. The Angolan\r\nGovernment has always been in favour of a negotiated\r\nsolution to the conflict which takes into account the\r\naspirations of the populations of the territory and\r\nencourages the parties to honour the agreements signed in\r\nHouston and to continue the ongoing dialogue in good\r\nfaith. In this connection, we support the joint efforts of\r\nthe OAU and the United Nations.\r\nWe are concerned with the continuation of the\r\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, the primary cause of the\r\ndeteriorating situation in the Middle East. Recent events\r\nhave delayed the peace process and have led to further\r\ndeterioration of the situation in the region. Angola\r\nreaffirms its support for the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast. Its success depends upon the reinforcement of\r\nmutual trust and the full implementation of the accords\r\nsigned between the parties concerned.\r\nWe endorse the position expressed in the Declaration\r\nof the Heads of State or Government of the OAU and the\r\nstatement made in New Delhi at the ministerial meeting\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement with regard to the question\r\nof Palestine.\r\nMy Government expresses its concern at the lack of\r\nprogress in the initiatives to bring about a just solution to\r\nthe question of East Timor. The Government of Angola\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\ndeplores the refusal by one of the parties to accept\r\nPresident Mandela’s initiative.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed on Cuba is a matter of concern to my Government,\r\nparticularly because of its negative impact on the economic\r\nand social situation of the Cuban people. We reiterate our\r\nappeal to have the embargo lifted, which will contribute to\r\nrelations between two peoples.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFinally, I should like to thank those who have given\r\nme the opportunity to speak today. As the Assembly knows,\r\nmy speech was to be delivered on 26 September. However,\r\ndue to a sad event which has happened in my country, I\r\nhave to leave tonight, and I was obliged to ask the\r\nAssembly to give me the opportunity to deliver my speech\r\ntoday.\r\nOne of our colleagues, the former of Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Angola, passed away yesterday. It is my\r\nduty to return home to pay my respects to my dear\r\ncolleague. Many here know Foreign Minister \"Loy\".\r\nI wish the Assembly well, and may good work be\r\ndone here for peace, stability and international cooperation.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I would like to express\r\nsincere condolences to the Government of Angola on the\r\ndeath of their brother, who spoke here at the General\r\nAssembly in years past.\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the general debate\r\nfor this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. I would like to\r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and\r\nto five minutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nSir John Weston (United Kingdom): I would like to\r\nspeak briefly in response to the remarks made today by the\r\nForeign Minister of Argentina concerning the Falkland\r\nIslands.\r\nWe welcome the Foreign Minister’s references to the\r\nhigh level of cooperation between the United Kingdom and\r\nArgentina which characterizes our bilateral relationship. The\r\nBritish Government sincerely hopes that the progress\r\nwhich has been achieved will be built on and developed.\r\nBut the British Government does not accept the\r\nForeign Minister’s remarks about sovereignty. We have\r\nno doubt about Britain’s sovereignty over the Falkland\r\nIslands and over the other British dependencies in the\r\nSouth Atlantic.\r\nIn the Falkland Islands we must heed the wishes of\r\nthe people. The elected representatives of the islanders,\r\nwho visited the United Nations for the debate in the\r\nCommittee of 24 in June this year, expressed their views\r\nclearly. They requested recognition that they, like any\r\nother democratic people, should be allowed to exercise\r\nthe right of self-determination. As the democratic voice of\r\nthe Falkland Islands people, they reiterated their view that\r\nthey did not want to be part of Argentina.\r\nDespite our differences with Argentina on the\r\nsubject of sovereignty, we maintain a constructive\r\ndialogue with the Argentine Government on matters such\r\nas hydrocarbons\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\ndevelopment and fisheries in the South Atlantic. We\r\ncontinue to hold discussions on these issues on a regular\r\nbasis while maintaining our position regarding sovereignty\r\nover the Falklands, and we value these practical steps to\r\ndevelop United Kingdom-Argentine cooperation. I hope\r\nboth sides can leave it at that for today.\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Republic of Argentina, having heard the\r\nstatement of the representative of the United Kingdom,\r\nwould like to reiterate the ideas expressed in the general\r\ndebate this afternoon by the Foreign Minister of Argentina,\r\nMr. Guido Di Tella.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
