(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is Her Excellency\r\nMs. Zdenka Kramplová, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSlovakia. I give her the floor.\r\nMs. Kramplová (Slovakia): Mr. President, at the\r\noutset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsecond session. I also wish to thank your predecessor, Mr.\r\nRazali Ismail, for his excellent work during the last session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nThe ongoing session of the General Assembly is\r\ncrucial in terms of showing the capability of the United\r\nNations to react adequately to changes in the global scene\r\nafter the end of the cold war, mainly in connection with\r\nproblems humankind faces on the eve of the new\r\nmillennium. We all know that if the United Nations is to\r\nmeet the expectations and needs of the new era, it must go\r\nthrough a process of reform. The Slovak Republic\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s report (A/51/950) entitled\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform”\r\nand supports his endeavours to streamline the work of the\r\nOrganization in order to achieve greater unity of purpose,\r\nstrategic deployment of resources, coherence of efforts and\r\nflexibility in response.\r\nThe suggestions included in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport reveal a firm determination to transform the United\r\nNations into a centre which takes an active part in\r\ngoverning international relations, in accordance with its\r\nmain principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Though one of the basic goals of the reform is\r\nto streamline the work of the Organization, along with\r\ncost-saving, the latter should not be the final goal of the\r\nreform, since this approach itself does not lead to the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system. Any reform\r\nof the Organization which would lead to a weakening of\r\nits position is not acceptable.\r\nThe financing of the United Nations is necessarily an\r\nintegral part of its reform, since continuation of the\r\ncurrent financial crisis has a grave impact on the\r\nperformance of the Organization. We believe the principle\r\nof honouring legal obligations — in this case, the\r\npayment of assessed contributions — should be a basis\r\nfor any solution to be adopted, although we understand\r\nthat a number of countries are in arrears to the\r\nOrganization because their rates of assessment do not\r\nreflect their capacity to pay.\r\nSlovakia belongs to a small group of countries —\r\nso-called good contributors — having paid its regular\r\nbudget contributions in full and on time this year. With\r\nregard to our peacekeeping- budget assessment, the\r\nGeneral Assembly decided to allocate Slovakia to group\r\nC of Member States for the period 1993 to 1996.\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nWe continue to believe that there is no need to limit\r\nthis decision strictly to such a short period. Speaking in\r\nterms of capacity to pay, Slovakia simply belongs to group\r\nC of the Member States. For this reason, the General\r\nAssembly should no longer postpone its decision on the\r\npermanent allocation of Slovakia to group C of the Member\r\nStates for the financing of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. We expect that the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-second session will take a decision confirming the\r\npermanent presence of Slovakia in this group. It was also\r\non the understanding of the difficult financial situation of\r\nthe United Nations that Slovakia, on the eve of the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly, paid in full its\r\narrears to the peacekeeping budget for the period 1993-\r\n1996.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nremains one of the main priorities of the United Nations\r\nand peacekeeping operations are a key instrument available\r\nin this regard. As experience in recent years has shown, the\r\nability to respond quickly with adequate mandate and\r\nmeans is a prerequisite to the successful completion of\r\npeacekeeping operations. The Slovak Republic fully\r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s efforts to build up the\r\nUnited Nations standby arrangement system and to establish\r\na rapidly deployable mission headquarters team. We are\r\nready to participate actively in this system while\r\nconsidering the allocation of appropriate means.\r\nPost-conflict peace-building is of crucial importance\r\nshould a conflict resolution achieve lasting results. In recent\r\nyears, the reconstruction of a conflict-torn society has\r\ninvolved a variety of actions. Many actors have been\r\nengaged in this process while lacking integrated\r\ncoordination. Therefore, we welcome the decision of the\r\nSecretary-General to make the Department of Political\r\nAffairs the focal point for defining objectives, criteria and\r\noperational guidelines in this regard, as well as his intention\r\nto strengthen the role of a special representative of the\r\nSecretary-General to be responsible for the implementation\r\nof peace-building initiatives in the field. At the same time,\r\nin our view, it is still necessary clearly to define the\r\ncompetence, interaction and feedback between the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs and the special\r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General.\r\nThe contribution of the Slovak Republic to the work\r\nof the United Nations rests first of all upon the concrete\r\nfulfilment of the primary purposes of the Organization, such\r\nas the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nSlovakia has been currently contributing its troops and\r\nmilitary observers to the United Nations Transitional\r\nAdministration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\r\nSirmium (UNTAES) in Eastern Slavonia and to the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA)\r\nin Angola. It also takes active part in the work of the\r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, of which\r\nit became a member in April this year, and thus\r\ncontributes to the improvement of the planning and\r\ncontrol system of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. On this occasion, I can state with full\r\nresponsibility that the Slovak Republic is interested in and\r\nis ready to continue contributing to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nExperience has proven that small and mid-size States\r\nare capable of bearing their part of the responsibility for\r\nstability and security in individual world regions. In this\r\nconnection, the Government of the Slovak Republic has\r\ndecided to present its candidature for a non-permanent\r\nseat in the Security Council for the term 2000-2001. We\r\nbelieve that the candidature of the Slovak Republic, which\r\nis not currently a member and has no representative in\r\nany of the principal United Nations organs, can win the\r\nsupport of the Member States in order to increase the\r\nrepresentativeness and democratic nature of this body.\r\nAlong with the reform measures initiated and\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General within his\r\ncompetence, a discussion of important issues that reside\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of Member States is under way. A\r\nnumber of stimulating as well as antagonistic opinions\r\nreflecting the complexity of the process have been\r\nformulated. The most evident example of this is the\r\nquestion of Security Council reform. It is in all our\r\ninterests that the Security Council’s composition and\r\ndecision-making procedure reflect the significant changes\r\nthat have taken place on the international political scene\r\nduring the last three decades. The Security Council’s\r\nreform should result in an enhancement of its legitimacy\r\nand representativeness, while maintaining its ability to\r\nreact promptly.\r\nIn our view, a new geopolitical situation on the\r\nglobal scene should be reflected in a new concept of the\r\nSecurity Council. Apparently, a decisive part of the\r\ngeneral membership is not ready for such a step and\r\npolitical circumstances have not sufficiently matured. At\r\nthe same time, the efforts aimed at restructuring the\r\nSecurity Council within a predetermined timetable, even\r\nin the absence of a general agreement, might be\r\ncounterproductive. Since Security Council reform is an\r\nextremely important and sensitive issue for the further\r\nexistence of the Organization, Slovakia prefers a\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\ncontinued and thorough discussion in this regard without an\r\nartificial acceleration of the whole process.\r\nThe change of priorities in international politics after\r\nthe end of the cold war, in particular the utmost necessity\r\nto solve various socio-economic problems, seems to have\r\nshifted arms control and disarmament issues out of sight.\r\nConcerned about this negative trend, we feel that\r\ndisarmament should again be given priority in the United\r\nNations agenda.\r\nRecently, the Slovak Republic, as a new member of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament, was honoured to chair that\r\nunique multilateral disarmament forum. We are convinced\r\nthat the Conference on Disarmament must play a further,\r\nindispensable role in solving the most important issues of\r\ninternational security, stability, peace, arms control and\r\ndisarmament.\r\nBesides the opening of concrete negotiations on the\r\nprohibition of the production of fissile materials for\r\nweapons and other explosive devices, we find especially\r\nimportant the question of a global and comprehensive ban\r\nof anti-personnel landmines. We understand the efforts to\r\nbring this issue to the Conference’s agenda and the Ottawa\r\nprocess to be fully complementary. We highly appreciate\r\nthe agreement on the text of the Ottawa convention reached\r\nrecently in Oslo.\r\nThe Slovak Republic has been continuously engaged\r\nin a number of activities that contribute to the alleviation of\r\nthe consequences of the use of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nReflecting the provisions of the Ottawa convention on the\r\nprohibition of anti-personnel landmines, we would like to\r\noffer our assistance in mine-clearance programmes by\r\nputting at the United Nations disposal a mine-clearance unit\r\nthat would follow up on the very successful performance of\r\nthe Slovak Engineer Battalion in former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe welcomed with satisfaction the conclusions\r\nreached at the first session of the Preparatory Committee\r\nfor the Sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nIt is important that the technical and formal approach to the\r\nwork of the Preparatory Committee has been altered, thus\r\nestablishing favourable conditions for the success of the\r\nReview Conference.\r\nThe Slovak Republic, which uses nuclear energy\r\nsolely for peaceful purposes, has supported all steps\r\ndesigned to lead to the elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nAs one of the 44 countries needed to ensure the\r\nConvention’s entry into force, the Slovak Republic is\r\nprepared to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT) before the end of this year. I would also\r\nlike to state that Slovakia has been honoured to chair the\r\nPreparatory Commission for the CTBT Organization.\r\nThis year’s entry into force of the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention can undoubtedly be considered the\r\nmost significant event in the field of disarmament. The\r\nSlovak Republic has been striving to strengthen the\r\nConvention through its active approach to the work of the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\r\nWe are proud to state that some of the Organization’s\r\ninspectors were trained in facilities provided by the\r\nSlovak Republic. We are interested in continuing these\r\nactivities in order to help the Organization fulfil its\r\nverification and preventive functions.\r\nSupport for economic and social progress is one of\r\nthe basic missions of the United Nations. We welcome\r\nthe creation of a new Department of Economic and Social\r\nAffairs, and we believe that this will lead to its further\r\nstreamlining and efficient performance. The Organization\r\nis a unique forum that can facilitate close cooperation and\r\npartnership for development among Governments, civil\r\nsociety, the private sector and regional and global\r\norganizations.\r\nThe role of the Economic and Social Council, as set\r\nforth 50 years ago in the United Nations Charter, needs\r\nto be revised. In a time of changing social and economic-\r\ndevelopment philosophy, it is necessary to strengthen the\r\npolicy-management and coordination roles of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as its position in\r\nthe macroeconomic-policy-coordination dialogue. The\r\nreform of the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the rationalization of their structure,\r\nwork and functions require, in our opinion, a careful\r\napproach, one to be taken with full respect for their\r\nautonomy while aiming at their further rationalization and\r\nconsolidation. The steps taken so far by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in this field are pointing in the right direction.\r\nSlovakia, as a member of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development and the Governing Council of\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, devoted\r\nconsiderable attention to the nineteenth special session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Although the special session has\r\nnot brought the expected results, we consider it an\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nimportant step in the global discussion on the strengthening\r\nof the principles of sustainable development.\r\nWe look forward with anticipation to the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on drugs. That session,\r\nwhich will be held next year, should yield concrete results\r\nwith regard to combating the production of and trafficking\r\nin narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. As we all\r\nknow, drugs pose a real threat, mainly to younger\r\ngenerations.\r\nSince the Slovak Republic’s establishment as an\r\nindependent State, it has been participating actively in the\r\nwork of one of the most important multilateral development\r\nbodies, namely, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP). Slovakia has been a member of the\r\nUNDP Executive Board since 1993. The UNDP regional\r\ncentre for Central and Eastern Europe was established in\r\nthe Slovak capital, Bratislava, in June of this year. The\r\ncreation of this centre is a concrete example of the\r\nachievement of United Nations reform, in this instance of\r\nUNDP’s efforts for decentralization at the country level and\r\ncutting the burden of administrative costs. The centre’s\r\nfoundation has been actively supported by Slovakia, and\r\nuse has been made of my country’s advantageous position\r\nas a bridge between UNDP secretariat activities at\r\nHeadquarters in New York and UNDP efforts in the\r\ncountries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States region. We are convinced that the\r\npresence of the UNDP regional centre in Bratislava will\r\nenable Slovakia to be even more active in development\r\ncooperation within the United Nations development group.\r\nHuman rights are a matter of the highest priority\r\namong the activities of the United Nations. Slovakia\r\nstresses the need for the consistent implementation of\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. In this regard we\r\nsupport the role of special rapporteurs appointed to selected\r\ncountries where systematic human rights abuses occur. We\r\nacknowledge the results the special rapporteurs have\r\nachieved in this field.\r\nThe Slovak Republic supports the ambitious proposals\r\nfor restructuring United Nations institutions dealing with\r\nhuman rights in order to create effective conditions for\r\nimproved protection of human rights. In this connection, we\r\nconsider it appropriate and necessary to harmonize the\r\nactivities of the Commission on Human Rights with the\r\nwork of the relevant expert committees established pursuant\r\nto international human rights treaties. At the same time, the\r\nSlovak Republic supports the creation of effective\r\nconditions for tripartite cooperation among Governments,\r\nthe United Nations and non-governmental organizations.\r\nHuman rights abuse has been the cause of a number\r\nof conflicts in many places on our planet, which are often\r\nfollowed by a humanitarian crisis on a massive scale.\r\nWomen and children are the most fragile sectors of any\r\nafflicted population. We must not forget this fact while\r\npursuing the purposes of the United Nations.\r\nI believe that the United Nations reform process will\r\nbe successfully completed in next few years. I find the\r\nSecretary-General’s programme for reform to be an\r\nimportant step in this regard. The Slovak Republic is\r\nprepared to contribute to this process so that the United\r\nNations can approach the next millennium as a modern,\r\nviable, global body with the adequate authority to fulfil\r\nthe purposes embodied in the United Nations Charter.\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Percival\r\nJames Patterson, Prime Minister of Jamaica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of Jamaica.\r\nThe Right Honourable Percival James Patterson,\r\nPrime Minister of Jamaica, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Jamaica, The Right Honourable\r\nPercival James Patterson, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Patterson (Jamaica): Mr. President, your\r\nelection to preside over the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is a fitting and well-deserved result of\r\nyour distinguished service for your country in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nI also wish to convey our appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for so ably\r\ndirecting the work of the fifty-first session, and to\r\ncongratulate him for a job well done.\r\nI join those who have spoken before me in\r\nwelcoming the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan to this,\r\nhis first General Assembly session since his assumption\r\nof office. Already he has impressed us with his sincerity\r\nof purpose and his willingness to take bold initiatives. He\r\ncan always rely on Jamaica’s full cooperation and support\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nas he seeks to steer the United Nations towards the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nExactly 35 years ago, Jamaica became a Member of\r\nthe United Nations by one of its first acts as a sovereign\r\nnation. We did so in recognition of the central role in the\r\nmanagement of global affairs which only the United\r\nNations can fill and from our desire to participate as an\r\nequal partner in that process. Ever since then, Jamaica has\r\nactively sought to contribute in a constructive spirit to the\r\nbuilding and strengthening of the international system. One\r\nconcrete result of these efforts is the location in Jamaica of\r\nan offshoot of the system, the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, established under the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea, which is generally acknowledged to\r\nhave been a signal achievement in extending the reach of\r\ninternational cooperation. We feel confident that the\r\nAuthority will be able to discharge its mandate efficiently\r\nas a completely autonomous institution.\r\nWe are constantly reminded that we are approaching\r\na new century and a new millennium. This new era\r\nprovides exciting possibilities and, at the same time, poses\r\nformidable challenges. It requires of us a creative effort to\r\nfind new directions and a continuing search for fresh\r\nsolutions. The fluidity and changing currents in world\r\naffairs demand constant adaptation and adjustments to meet\r\ncontemporary realities.\r\nSome old disputes remain unresolved, and an array of\r\nnew problems continues to enter the international agenda.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East should not be allowed to\r\nremain forever a source of anxiety and frustration. The rise\r\nof ethnic violence and intercommunal conflict must be\r\nhalted now.\r\nWhatever cloud of uncertainty may hang over the\r\nfuture, we must not fail to lay the foundations of a more\r\nstable and equitable world order which fosters greater hope\r\nand wider opportunities for mankind.\r\nAs we seek to strengthen the fabric of international\r\nsecurity, there needs to be a concentrated focus on the root\r\ncauses of instability, conflict and confrontation everywhere.\r\nThe danger signals are unmistakably clear. The coexistence\r\nof a world of wealth and prosperity and a world of poverty\r\nand misery is too profound a contradiction to be ignored. It\r\nlies at the heart of an emerging crisis. More than one\r\nbillion human beings are still condemned to abject poverty.\r\nThe despair and frustration which form their daily\r\nexperience breed tension and trigger instability which are\r\nbound to erupt from time to time.\r\nIn a world where we note with increasing concern\r\nthe absence of appropriate measures by multilateral\r\nfinancial institutions to relieve the burden of debt, we are\r\nbound to question whether the economic measures applied\r\nin the last few years represent the only way for\r\ndeveloping countries to orient their economies. We cannot\r\naccept that the impoverishment of millions is a necessary\r\ncost of future world growth.\r\nGlobalization and liberalization, which have led to\r\nthe breaking down of so many barriers between nations,\r\nare not removing the barriers between rich and poor. The\r\nprocess seems instead to be widening the differences and\r\ndeepening the divide. The benefits of increased production\r\nand the expansion of global trade have been unevenly\r\nspread. Many developing countries are being increasingly\r\nmarginalized in the process. Expected transfers of\r\nresources from increased trade and investment flows have\r\nnot materialized, while the burden of debt remains a\r\nmajor constraint on development. Simply put, the rich are\r\ngetting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\r\nUnless we redress the imbalance — and quickly —\r\nthe disparities will increase exponentially. To avert\r\nimminent disaster, there has to be a reversal of the pattern\r\nof transfer of technology and more liberal access to the\r\nmarkets of developed countries.\r\nIn all this, the United Nations has a decisive and\r\nstrategic role to play. It should direct and channel\r\ninternational cooperation to correct distortions and\r\ninequities in the system, and contribute to the creation of\r\nan international economic environment facilitating\r\neconomic growth and the benefits of development for all.\r\nThe new trading system is skewed in favour of the\r\neconomically powerful. It is becoming more and more\r\napparent that free trade, as practised by its loudest\r\nadvocates, is not necessarily fair trade. For developing\r\ncountries, access to larger markets remains difficult,\r\nowing to a variety of protective barriers. And where\r\nspecial and historical market arrangements for small\r\nproducers still exist, these are now under threat from\r\nalliances of powerful governmental and private interests.\r\nWe developing countries cannot afford to shut\r\nourselves off from what is taking place around us. The\r\npace of change is at times bewildering, but we cannot\r\nsay, “Stop the world, I want to get off”. We must make\r\nuse of the positive elements of modernity, organization of\r\nwork and efficiency, to build the kind of society we wish\r\nto leave to our children. The empowerment of all of the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\npeoples of our countries is of paramount importance to the\r\nadvancement of our societies.\r\nSuch empowerment requires that priority attention be\r\ngiven to human-resource development and human-capital\r\nformation, and to the optimal utilization of all the available\r\nhuman and natural resources of our time. Increasingly,\r\nwhere this has not already started, our programmes of\r\neducation and training will have to be redesigned and\r\nrefocused to enable our peoples to function effectively in\r\nthe emerging knowledge-based world economy.\r\nApplications of science and technology and advances in\r\ntelecommunications must become all-pervasive factors to be\r\neffectively and appropriately utilized for the benefit of our\r\npeoples.\r\nNothing would better fulfil the lofty ideals of our\r\nfounding fathers than an immediate global assault on\r\npoverty, ignorance and disease. To win the battle, I call\r\nupon this Assembly to emphasize the creation, application\r\nand dissemination of knowledge in every corner of the\r\nEarth.\r\nLiberalization and globalization, as they are being\r\npractised, have not shown the capacity or willingness to\r\ntake into account the genuine interests or practical\r\npossibilities of small States. This is the painful lesson that\r\nwe as Caribbean producers of bananas have learned. The\r\nrecent panel ruling by the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) in Geneva on the European banana regime threatens\r\nto ruin the economies of the smaller States of the\r\nCaribbean, thereby endangering the economic stability of\r\nthe entire region. It demonstrates not only the vulnerability\r\nof small economies, but also the extent to which we are at\r\nthe mercy of those whose calculations seem oblivious to the\r\ninterests of our survival.\r\nSmall economies operate under severe resource\r\nconstraints and need to conserve the natural environment,\r\nwhich is a precious resource. That is why countries\r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) attach\r\nspecial importance to international recognition of the\r\npeculiar circumstances and needs of small island developing\r\nStates, as highlighted in the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction, which was adopted by the United Nations Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States.\r\nIt is with great disappointment that we note how little\r\nprogress has been made to implement the Programme of\r\nAction. There is a special need for financing arrangements\r\nto develop production capabilities, infrastructure and\r\nenvironmental protection programmes.\r\nSmall island States suffer other disadvantages. The\r\nCaribbean is renowned for its natural beauty, but it is also\r\nvulnerable to a range of frequent natural disasters. To the\r\nphysical limitations in resources and economic scale have\r\nbeen added the hazards of nature.\r\nEven as I speak, the people of the small island of\r\nMontserrat are struggling to maintain their existence in\r\ntheir own land, two thirds of which has been destroyed by\r\na volcano that resumed activity just over two years ago.\r\nAs a member of the Caribbean Community, Montserrat\u0027s\r\nplight is of grave concern to all CARICOM States. I\r\nspeak on behalf of the Community in acknowledging the\r\ncategorical commitment given by the administering\r\nPower, the United Kingdom, for both emergency\r\nassistance to Montserratians and for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of that territory.\r\nThe costs of reconstruction are immense. Members\r\nof the Caribbean Community have offered constructive\r\nsupport to the recovery efforts. We believe that the\r\ninternational community should also respond in a\r\nhumanitarian gesture of solidarity. I therefore take this\r\nopportunity to appeal to the General Assembly to\r\ndemonstrate appropriate support for Montserrat through\r\nthe adoption of tangible measures to assist in the\r\nrebuilding and sustainable development of that island. It\r\nis our hope and expectation that the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations will be able to devise a specific scheme\r\nof assistance for a small and courageous people.\r\nWe all look to the United Nations to help in\r\nemergencies, but above all, to be effective in keeping the\r\npeace. It should be ready to respond promptly to crises as\r\nthey occur and to defuse tensions and conflict situations\r\nthrough preventive diplomacy. We believe the present\r\ntime affords a significant opportunity for creating the\r\nframework to fulfil this role and for us to shape a rapid-\r\nresponse capability.\r\nIn recent years, a number of unilateral as well as\r\nmultilateral measures have resulted in a more positive\r\nclimate for international peace and security. The\r\nconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly and\r\nthe entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\nhave enhanced the prospects for real progress towards the\r\ngoal of general and complete disarmament. We\r\nnevertheless acknowledge that more needs to be done in\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nthe areas of arms regulation and disarmament, in respect\r\nespecially of conventional weapons and the proliferation of\r\nsmall arms.\r\nWe welcome the steps being taken to prohibit the use\r\nof anti-personnel landmines, which should be regarded as\r\na category of inhumane weapons that can no longer be\r\nallowed to cause the maiming and loss of life of civilians.\r\nWe urge Member States to give full support to the Ottawa\r\nprocess for the conclusion of an international treaty to ban\r\nthis category of weapons so that there can be universal\r\nobedience.\r\nThe threat to international peace and security can no\r\nlonger be viewed in purely military and political terms.\r\nIllicit trafficking in drugs poses a serious threat, as all\r\ntoo often we witness the pervasive and pernicious effects of\r\nthe production and consumption of illicit drugs. The\r\nmassive demand and the lure of profits from the trade have\r\nspawned a transnational network of criminals with\r\nconsiderable resources and influence. The activities of these\r\ngroups are particularly threatening to small States such as\r\nthose in the Caribbean, where the State apparatus is often\r\nstretched to deal with their coercive capability. Within the\r\nCaribbean Community we have taken these threats seriously\r\nand have committed significant resources to confronting\r\nthem. Our geographical proximity to the major destination\r\nfor the consumption of drugs makes the Caribbean\r\nparticularly vulnerable as a transshipment point. We\r\ntherefore view bilateral and regional cooperation as critical\r\nto combating drug smuggling.\r\nAn associated problem that is particularly dangerous\r\nfor us is the smuggling of arms and weapons of destruction,\r\nwhich is a significant factor in spreading a cycle of crime\r\nand violence. CARICOM has pushed for a regional\r\ninitiative to attack this problem. We look forward to\r\nhemisphere support, particularly in restricting illegal exports\r\nfrom the main areas of manufacturing and sale of small\r\narms.\r\nIt is evident from all the forces at work that the\r\nimperatives of interdependence, the impact of globalization\r\nand the interlinkage in global problems require a renewal\r\nand strengthening of multilateralism. With the end of the\r\ncold war, we now have within our grasp the opportunity to\r\nestablish a lasting framework for international cooperation\r\nand to build genuine partnerships that will guarantee a\r\nfuture that is secure for all. The challenges of the emerging\r\nworld order are best addressed by multilateral approaches.\r\nIsolationism and unilateralism cannot be viable options, but\r\nmultilateralism can thrive only if there are effective\r\nmultilateral institutions.\r\nThe United Nations remains indispensable as the\r\nonly universal mechanism capable of addressing issues of\r\nglobal impact and concern. But we must realize that the\r\ninternational society which the United Nations now serves\r\nis vastly different from the one in existence when the\r\nOrganization was originally created. The reshaping of the\r\nUnited Nations therefore has to take into account new and\r\ncomplex international realities. Without compromising the\r\nfundamental objectives of the Charter, we need new rules\r\nand procedures to guide us.\r\nOf special importance is the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, in terms of both composition and mode of\r\noperation. The Council is a vital organ in the working of\r\nthe United Nations. It is essential for its effectiveness that\r\nit command the confidence of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nJamaica supports an expansion of membership of the\r\nCouncil which will make it more representative of the\r\ninternational community. We advocate the adoption of\r\nprocedures that will make it more democratic and\r\ntransparent in decision-making. We recognize that there\r\nare important and delicate issues at stake and that we\r\nshould proceed with care, but we have a concern that the\r\nprocess should not be mired in endless debate. We\r\nbelieve there is a sufficient consensus on proposals to\r\nform the basis for decisions soon.\r\nWe also acknowledge that more efficient\r\nmanagement and more scope for effective initiative by the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff are essential to a\r\nstrengthened United Nations structure. We support the\r\nSecretary-General in this endeavour.\r\nJamaica also endorses the need for measures to\r\nimprove efficiency, and we have no quarrel with reform\r\nto streamline and rationalize the system. In welcoming\r\nthese steps, we must however emphasize that reform is\r\nnot synonymous with cost cutting. Reform is not about\r\ndoing less; it is about doing better.\r\nWe would therefore wish to see a process that\r\nstrengthens the capacity of the United Nations to deliver\r\nthe services required by Member States as well as cement\r\nthe linkages among the organs of the system while\r\npreserving comparative advantages, complementarities and\r\nsynergies. The exercise must improve the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations to take preventive action and respond\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nswiftly to crises. Above all, for small developing nations\r\nsuch as my own it is important that the Organization\r\ncontinue to play a leadership role in defining global\r\ndevelopment priorities.\r\nNot all Member States will readily embrace the reform\r\nproposals that have been introduced, yet no one can deny\r\nthe need for meaningful action to strengthen and improve\r\nthe United Nations system. We must therefore seek to find\r\ncommon cause and summon the collective will to\r\nimplement the measures that are necessary for its\r\nrevitalization. It is our collective responsibility. Effective\r\nreform of our global institution requires broad agreement on\r\nthe main features of the new global environment. We must\r\nclearly define the role the United Nations is expected to\r\nplay in the next millennium. Our common vision must be\r\none in which the United Nations can act as the catalyst for\r\nchange and an instrument of progress on behalf of all\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nLet us resolve to equip the United Nations with the\r\nnecessary tools, including the requisite financial resources\r\nin accordance with Charter obligations, to enable it\r\neffectively to undertake its leadership role in safeguarding\r\ninternational peace and security in ensuring the economic\r\nand social well-being of mankind. It is our responsibility,\r\nand our peoples are looking for an institution energized to\r\nact effectively and swiftly to address the challenges that\r\nconfront us as we approach the twenty-first century. Let us\r\nexploit the opportunity we now have to fashion a United\r\nNations which reflects the hope and aspirations of all\r\nmankind for sustainable development, for lasting security\r\nand for enduring peace.\r\nThe new millennium beckons with its endless\r\npossibilities and challenges. Let not narrow self-interest\r\nprevent us from taking bold and decisive steps to meet\r\nthese challenges. Jamaica and the Caribbean Community\r\nstand ready to play their part in a cooperative effort to\r\nattain global equity and prosperity. All of us owe it to\r\nourselves and to succeeding generations.\r\nI urge the international community wholeheartedly to\r\nembrace this venture in a genuine spirit of solidarity and\r\nharmony. History will not forgive us should we fail to do\r\nso.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Jamaica for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nThe Right Honourable Percival James Patterson,\r\nPrime Minister of Jamaica, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nEduardo Ferrero Costa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nPeru.\r\nMr. Ferrero Costa (Peru)(interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to take part in this\r\nGeneral Assembly as the representative of the people and\r\nGovernment of Peru, under the leadership of President\r\nAlberto Fujimori. I extend my congratulations to you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on your election to preside over this session\r\nand assure you of the fullest support by the delegation of\r\nPeru. We likewise congratulate Ambassador Razali Ismail,\r\nPresident of the previous session.\r\nPeru reaffirms its unfailing dedication to the\r\npurposes, principles and norms enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, without whose faithful application\r\nit is not possible to achieve peace and harmonious\r\ncoexistence among States. We must all ensure respect for\r\ninternational law, especially scrupulous and good-faith\r\ncompliance with treaties, and must contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\r\nparticipate in the promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Accordingly, effective observance of the\r\nCharter and respect for its principles are today more\r\nnecessary than ever in order to endow multilateralism\r\nwith renewed credibility and vigour. We live in a day of\r\nmarked change in the organization of power and of\r\nglobalizing trends in the international system which\r\nrequire, in keeping with the Charter, a scrupulous\r\negalitarianism in relations between States and,\r\naccordingly, multilateral policies in keeping with the\r\ntimes as an appropriate means of conferring priority on\r\nthe common goals of mankind in our era.\r\nInstitutional reform of the United Nations system is\r\nimperative to make it more efficient, adapt it to the\r\npresent needs of the international community and\r\nconsolidate institutions that will be truly representative of\r\nthe interests we all share.\r\nFor four years now the General Assembly has been\r\nat work on the reform of the Security Council. National\r\npositions have already been made known and reiterated.\r\nWe should now decide whether we shall embark on the\r\nnegotiations proper or whether that should be deferred\r\nuntil better political conditions prevail, for the\r\nunproductive prolongation of this debate could affect the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nprestige and authority of the Organization at a juncture\r\nwhen it is essential instead to strengthen it as the supreme\r\nworld forum for dialogue, understanding and cooperation.\r\nWe are aware of the difficulty of this process. To\r\nthose who have a duty to exercise their power with self-\r\nrestraint we address an invitation to be flexible. We also\r\nbelieve that pressures or haste would be ill advised, since\r\nthey could hinder the achievement of a legitimate and vital\r\ngoal.\r\nPeru believes it is necessary to make the Security\r\nCouncil representative, to enhance its legitimacy, to secure\r\nequitable geographical representation through its expansion,\r\nto give it greater transparency, and to take the first steps\r\ntowards the abolition of the veto through strict limits on its\r\nuse. Accordingly, Peru supports the increase of both\r\ncategories of members. All of the foregoing should be\r\nachieved through a legitimate agreement that does not\r\ndiscriminate against developing countries.\r\nTo keep pace with the momentum generated by global\r\nproblems, a new institutional structure is needed, such as\r\nthat proposed by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in his\r\n“A Programme for Reform.” In order better to serve\r\ninternational peace and stability and the sustained growth of\r\nthe world economy, renewed efforts are needed that will be\r\nin keeping with the diversity of Member States.\r\nWe support the strengthening of the Secretariat, the\r\nemphasis on the promotion of development and the\r\nrecommendation for rationalizing and optimizing the use of\r\nits financial resources, as well as the transfer of the\r\nresources thus released to development cooperation\r\nactivities.\r\nThe Human Development Report for 1977 reveals that\r\nthe problem of internally displaced persons has taken on\r\ndramatic dimensions; the numbers increased fivefold during\r\nthe decade 1984-1994. At the same time, we note in the\r\nreport submitted by the representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the Commission on Human Rights concerning\r\ninstitutional lacunae in this area of the United Nations that\r\nthere is no institution with exclusive responsibility for such\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nWe propose that at this session of the General\r\nAssembly, which the Secretary General has called the\r\nreform Assembly, the question of institutional responsibility\r\nfor the internally displaced be addressed.\r\nPeru favours the idea of unifying the country offices\r\nand operations of the agencies to facilitate the\r\nimplementation of comprehensive programmes in which\r\nthe United Nations system will be able to put its\r\nrecognized capacities to full use.\r\nNo reform can be successful without the necessary\r\nfinancial resources. The financial situation of the\r\nOrganization is a subject of widespread concern. Peru is\r\nof the view that contributions to the regular budget are a\r\nlegal obligation that should be fully and promptly\r\ndischarged. The principle of capacity to pay should\r\nremain the fundamental criterion in the apportionment of\r\nassessments. Accordingly, if States in arrears do not take\r\nconcrete measures to clear their indebtedness, certainly\r\nwithout setting conditions, it will not be possible in a\r\ntimely manner to earmark resources for activities essential\r\nto the majority of our countries. Such is the case, for\r\nexample, with the campaign against poverty.\r\nThere are other key questions on our increasingly\r\nabundant international agenda. We must place increasing\r\nemphasis on economic and social issues, cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, environmental protection, humanitarian\r\nassistance, the advancement and defence of human rights\r\nand, of course, the fight against illegal drug trafficking,\r\nterrorism and corruption.\r\nPeru approaches the development of the international\r\nsystem on the basis of four criteria that guide its foreign\r\npolicy: the pre-eminence of representative democracy and\r\nthe rule of law; the promotion of the fundamental rights\r\nof the human person; consolidation of the market\r\neconomy and development of regional economic\r\nintegration agreements; and the search for peace and the\r\nadvancement of cooperation for development.\r\nIn the era of globalization, Peru views international\r\npeace and security as multidimensional tasks. If States are\r\nto assume them as real commitments and priorities, they\r\nmust be associated with a higher purpose, namely, with\r\nimproving the intolerable lot of some 60 per cent of the\r\nworld\u0027s population.\r\nProblems such as poverty, acute poverty, illiteracy,\r\nmalnutrition, infant mortality, discrimination and\r\nmarginalization in general constitute a picture of potential\r\nsocial violence that threatens the universal ideal of a\r\npeaceful and orderly life. The plight of poverty and the\r\nchallenge of promoting human development have\r\nradically altered the direction and pace of international\r\nrelations.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nThe international system is tending towards a gradual\r\ndemilitarization. With the end of the cold war and the\r\nreduced risk of a global military confrontation, conditions\r\nhave been created to give priority, on the basis of dialogue\r\nand cooperation, to the long-delayed task of advancing\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nGeneral and complete disarmament continues to be a\r\nkey element in security and an abiding goal of the\r\ninternational community. Peru attaches special importance\r\nto non-proliferation in all its aspects, primarily nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and nuclear disarmament. My country\r\nparticipated actively in the arduous negotiations that\r\nculminated in the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nand signed it on the day it was opened for signature.\r\nWe are gratified at the outcome of the Oslo\r\nDiplomatic Conference, in the context of the Ottawa\r\nprocess to prohibit the production, transfer and\r\nindiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines, in which\r\nPeru has participated as a full member from the outset. We\r\nare preparing to sign the global agreement in December.\r\nThe Rio Group has undertaken to make our region the first\r\nin the world to be free of these odious devices, which day\r\nafter day continue to take their toll of thousands of innocent\r\nvictims.\r\nPeru is a peace-loving country that works for peace\r\nand repudiates conflict. We want to strengthen political and\r\neconomic cooperation with all countries and groups of\r\ncountries in various regions on the basis of common\r\ninterests and mutual benefit. We emphasize especially the\r\nforging of closer ties of friendship and cooperation with\r\nneighbouring countries and fostering mutual trust through\r\nspecific processes, mechanisms and measures that we are\r\nvigorously pursuing.\r\nWithout economic growth, there can be no creation of\r\nwealth or jobs, and without these there can be no\r\ndevelopment or prosperity. That is the great challenge of\r\nour time. We must act to create conditions of market\r\ntransparency and social convergence in order to sustain the\r\ngrowth of the world economy, the opening and\r\nliberalization of trade, services and capital flows and the\r\ntransfer of technology. Developed and developing countries\r\nmust reach an understanding in order to avoid a return to\r\nthat not-so-distant past when narrow forms of protectionism\r\nand conditionalities failed to overcome inequality and,\r\nindeed, aggravated it.\r\nGlobalization must not lead to greater poverty and\r\ndiscrimination, for they are one of the principal obstacles to\r\nstability, and, on the eve of the twenty-first century, they\r\nalso pose a moral challenge. We must adopt measures to\r\nincorporate disadvantaged societies into policies and\r\nprocesses that promote economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn Peru, the campaign for the gradual reduction of\r\npoverty until its eradication has taken a comprehensive\r\napproach. Its focal points are openness, modernization and\r\nliberalization of the economy, reform of the State and a\r\nlegal framework that guarantees property and promotes\r\ninvestment. In addition, we are pursuing consistent\r\nsectoral policies, financed by 40 per cent of our national\r\nbudget going to items in the social sphere, such as health,\r\nhousing, education, population and justice. The results\r\nalready achieved in economic and social growth are well\r\nknown, and Peru is considered a stable, secure country\r\nwith a bright future. Around the year 2000, the Peruvian\r\nGovernment hopes significantly to reduce acute poverty\r\nand poverty in general.\r\nThe United Nations has primary responsibility for\r\naddressing three negatives trends of universal scope: illicit\r\ndrug trafficking, terrorism and corruption. We are\r\ncombating vigorously these criminal phenomena because\r\nthey erode fundamental values and threaten the stability\r\nof democracies. The upcoming special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the question of drugs — a session\r\nthat we fully support — calls for unity of purpose. The\r\ninternational community will have an excellent\r\nopportunity to tackle this problem in all of its dimensions.\r\nPeru has been achieving concrete results in all facets of\r\nthis comprehensive campaign, not only in interdiction but\r\nalso in crop eradication and alternative development. We\r\nhope to see a substantial increase in international\r\ncooperation that would help step up our anti-drug policy\r\nand would complement, even if only partially, the\r\ntremendous national efforts that we have been making.\r\nWe hope that this enhanced cooperation will materialize,\r\nin view of the increased awareness and greater political\r\nwill that have emerged worldwide regarding a problem\r\nfor which all of us, without exception, share\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe Eighth International Anti-Corruption\r\nConference, which took place three weeks ago in the\r\ncapital of Peru, brought together more than 600\r\nrepresentatives from 93 countries. I wish to highlight the\r\nset of recommendations that emerged for combating\r\npublic and private corruption. These are contained in the\r\nLima Declaration, the first global document of its kind. It\r\nestablishes an evaluation and follow-up mechanism that\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nwill bring these recommendations to the attention of\r\nGovernments and international institutions. The goal\r\nhenceforth in this endeavour, which concerns Governments\r\nand citizens equally, will be to identify specific problem\r\nareas, taking into account public opinion and with the\r\neffective participation of civil society.\r\nThe United Nations, as the global framework for\r\ncombating corruption in all its manifestations, must\r\nparticipate in these efforts, just as the inter-American\r\nsystem has been doing within its own geographical area.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism has, at the cost of\r\ncountless innocent human lives and huge material losses,\r\ntoday placed itself on the agenda of contemporary\r\ninternational relations. We have already unequivocally and\r\nat all levels condemned terrorist acts and the criminal\r\ngroups that perpetrate them, and we have also agreed that\r\nterrorist acts represent human rights violations. It is now\r\ntime to undertake a process of consultation that will enable\r\nthe international community to avail itself of universal legal\r\ninstruments with which to combat effectively terrorism in\r\nall its forms and manifestations, as we are striving to do on\r\nour continent.\r\nFive years after the adoption of the plan of action of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the lack of\r\nprogress on Agenda 21 is discouraging. There has been an\r\nerosion of the political commitment entered into, especially\r\nwith respect to the allocation of new and additional\r\nresources, as well as scant willingness to transfer\r\ntechnology to the developing countries.\r\nWe reaffirm that only a comprehensive approach can\r\nlead to the achievement of sustainable development,\r\nbecause this requires a consolidation of the process of the\r\nopening and liberalization of trade, as well as commercial\r\nand environmental policies that are mutually supportive. An\r\nadequate transfer of financial resources and technologies to\r\nsupport national policies is also required. In this task, no\r\nState should shirk its individual responsibility.\r\nOne of the challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity is to ensure the effective promotion and full\r\nobservance of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe advancement and protection of human rights are central\r\nconcerns of the Peruvian Government. The concept of\r\nhuman development, which underlies the entire economic\r\nand social policy of our State, focuses on a revalorization\r\nof life and of the human being. The cooperation of the\r\nUnited Nations is essential, through a realistic approach that\r\ntakes due account of regional and national characteristics\r\nand that is geared primarily to achieving a culture of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nMany countries, including Peru, are currently facing\r\na cyclical, worldwide natural phenomenon known as El\r\nNiño, whose severe economic, environmental and social\r\nconsequences are drastically changing the marine\r\nenvironment, which is a source of food and employment\r\nfor broad sectors of humankind. The damage that these\r\nlarge-scale oceanic and atmospheric changes did in the\r\npast prompted my country some decades ago to promote\r\nthe study of this phenomenon. Thus in 1974 a regional\r\nstudy of El Niño was carried out in the framework of the\r\nPermanent South Pacific Commission, a subregional\r\norgan of the South-East Pacific Action Plan, which has\r\ncontinued to address this problem with the valuable\r\nsupport of organizations such as the Intergovernmental\r\nOceanographic Commission and the World\r\nMeteorological Organization.\r\nThe knowledge acquired by Peru and other countries,\r\nas well as by international, regional, and world bodies,\r\nneeds to be integrated and systematized. Accordingly,\r\nPeru proposes the establishment of a global programme\r\nof integrated cooperation on the El Niño phenomenon,\r\nwhich would enable our countries to mitigate its effects\r\nand the ensuing material damage. In order to lay the\r\nfoundations of this program and set it in motion, we\r\nshould consider holding an international meeting with the\r\nparticipation of the relevant agencies of the system,\r\nregional organs and the respective national programmes\r\nof the countries concerned. In this context, we propose\r\nthat, as part of the reform of the United Nations system,\r\nits operational capacity in the area of the monitoring and\r\nthe mobilization of assistance for natural disasters be\r\nmaintained and strengthened.\r\nThe development policy now being implemented in\r\nPeru is anchored in the universal concepts, values and\r\nprinciples propounded by the United Nations: democracy,\r\neconomic freedom, respect for the fundamental rights of\r\nthe human person, environmental conservation, the\r\nadvancement of women and protection of the rights of\r\nindigenous populations.\r\nResponding to the dictates of its history and\r\ngeography, Peruvian society has since ancient times\r\nembodied the ideal of unity within diversity. We\r\nPeruvians are laying the foundations of our own future. I\r\nshall not dwell on the policies that we have been pursuing\r\nfor the last seven years, their impressive results or the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nvicissitudes in this process that have tested our resolve and\r\nperseverance. But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the\r\nprincipal characteristic of our development model, which is\r\na harmonious and rational complementary relationship\r\nbetween economic and social policies, which for the first\r\ntime in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic\r\nstrategy for sustainable human development. Accordingly,\r\nthe modern and efficient functioning of the United Nations\r\nsystem of cooperation is now, more than ever, of strategic\r\nvalue to Peru. I should like in particular to express thanks\r\nfor the cooperation that the United Nations system has been\r\nproviding to the Peruvian people, which is stimulating and\r\ncomplementing our national effort.\r\nThe United Nations is the best instrument available at\r\na global level to consolidate international peace and\r\nsecurity, respect for the sovereignty and independence of\r\nStates and international law, and for the promotion of\r\neconomic and social development. Accordingly, its\r\noperations, approaches and strategies should provide\r\neffective answers to the challenges of the contemporary\r\nworld and the needs of our peoples, who continue to place\r\ntheir hopes in our Organization. Peru will always remain\r\ncommitted to that endeavour.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Croatia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mate Granić.\r\nMr. Granić (Croatia): It is a special privilege and\r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly at the\r\nbeginning of its fifty-second session.\r\nAt the outset I would like to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, as the new President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, confident that your extensive and\r\nproven diplomatic experience and skills will play an\r\nimportant role in the work of the Assembly.\r\nI should also like to express our gratitude to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail, whose devoted and\r\nvigorous work has shown that United Nations reform is\r\nmuch more than mere rhetoric, and who set a new standard\r\nof performance in the General Assembly.\r\nAs a Central European and Mediterranean country,\r\nCroatia highlights as its strategic priorities overall stability\r\nin the region, full integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions\r\nand the assertion of its position in the new post-cold-war\r\nEurope. Hence the special attention my Government pays\r\nto the policy of good neighbourliness and the development\r\nof stable relations with all neighbouring countries, based\r\non the principles of full respect for the existing\r\ninternationally recognized borders, for minority rights and\r\nfor the peaceful resolution of existing and possible\r\ndisputes in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Today\r\nI can point out with satisfaction that Croatia has\r\nconcluded dozens of bilateral agreements with its\r\nneighbours, and relations with each of our immediate\r\nneighbours are being fully regulated and are steadily\r\nimproving.\r\nCroatia hosted two large-scale United Nations peace\r\noperations: the United Nations Protection Force\r\n(UNPROFOR) and the United Nations Confidence\r\nRestoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO). The United\r\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\r\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), in the\r\nDanubian area, and the United Nations Mission of\r\nObservers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) are still present. Croatia\r\nhas also played an important role in facilitating the\r\nStabilization Force (SFOR) operation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my\r\nGovernment’s sincere gratitude for all the efforts that\r\nwere made by the United Nations to stop the war in\r\nCroatia and alleviate its consequences, as well as to\r\nexpress my country’s sincere sympathies to the families\r\nof the “blue helmets” who have fallen while attending to\r\ntheir lofty duties.\r\nI am very grateful for the opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation and thanks to the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his peace efforts in Croatia.\r\nAs a United Nations official in the field and as Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations he made\r\na major personal contribution to overcoming the crisis.\r\nOur great thanks go to UNTAES and Mr. Jacques Klein,\r\nuntil recently Transitional Administrator in Eastern\r\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, whose vigorous\r\nwork, leadership skill and successful cooperation with the\r\nCroatian Government have been instrumental in the\r\npeaceful reintegration of these areas into Croatia.\r\nDuring the many months of the United Nations\r\npresence in Croatia and elsewhere in the area of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, my country had a chance to see for\r\nitself all the potential and the weaknesses of peacekeeping\r\noperations. It has been proven beyond any doubt that a\r\npeace operation can be successful only if its mandate is\r\nclearly defined, in terms of its goal as well as its time-\r\nframe, and if it is actively and fully supported by the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General, and\r\nspearheaded by an uncompromising leadership explicitly\r\ndetermined to use all means required for the completion of\r\nits mission.\r\nThis knowledge has been gained at a high political,\r\nmaterial and, worst of all, human price, so it is to be hoped\r\nthat it will be wisely exploited in the future. For its part,\r\nCroatia is anxious to step out of its role as a country\r\nhosting peacekeeping operations and instead assume the\r\nrole of an active participant in such operations elsewhere.\r\nHere and now I can confirm the readiness of my country to\r\njoin the roster of United Nations Member States whose\r\ntroops participate in international peace endeavours.\r\nThe fifty-second session of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place against a background of great obligations and\r\nequally great expectations regarding the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations system. The timely and far-reaching\r\nproposals put forward by the Secretary-General have\r\nopened the door for reforms. Croatia gives its firm support\r\nto his proposals, and we are ready to render any assistance\r\nneeded in introducing the kind of changes we owe both to\r\nthose who laid the foundations of this Organization and to\r\nfuture generations. As for the need to rationalize the work\r\nof the General Assembly and reduce its huge agenda,\r\nCroatia has put forward a proposal to delete the item on the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda entitled “The situation in the\r\noccupied territories of Croatia”, as its title and topic no\r\nlonger correspond to the situation on the ground, which\r\nmakes it obsolete.\r\nIn view of the geopolitical realities, Croatia advocates\r\nan increase in the number of Security Council members,\r\nboth permanent and non-permanent. Half a century of old\r\nstereotypes ought to be phased out. Croatia supports the\r\nidea of granting permanent member status to Germany and\r\nJapan, with the right to permanent membership being kept\r\nin mind for those parts of the world, primarily Africa,\r\nwhich for more than 50 years, without any justification,\r\nhave been deprived of permanent Security Council\r\nrepresentation. Furthermore, my country supports the idea\r\nof assigning one more seat on the Security Council to the\r\nEastern European Group.\r\nCroatia strongly supports the reaffirmation and full\r\nimplementation of the universality of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My country\r\nwas pleased to note that during this year’s NPT Preparatory\r\nCommittee sessions some progress was achieved with\r\nregard to the principle of non-first use, especially against\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States, and it calls on the nuclear\r\nStates to give due consideration to proposals to have this\r\nprinciple codified in a legally binding document.\r\nIn May 1996, the Review Conference of the States\r\nParties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions\r\non the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May\r\nBe Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or To Have\r\nIndiscriminate Effects amended Protocol II on landmines.\r\nCroatia, which has played an active role during the\r\nOttawa process from the beginning, and which has\r\nalready put in place its own unilateral moratorium on\r\nlandmines, fully supports all the efforts which ultimately\r\nled to the decision at the recent Oslo conference to adopt\r\nthe text of a global treaty banning anti-personnel\r\nlandmines.\r\nCroatia’s preoccupation with the global landmine\r\nproblem is also motivated by personal affliction. Millions\r\nof mines laid in the formerly occupied territories of\r\nCroatia during the war continue to pose a direct threat,\r\nespecially to the most vulnerable: civilians. It is also a\r\ngreat impediment to the reconstruction of war-affected\r\nareas. The clearing of mines in these areas is a\r\npainstaking process, and, in spite of our best efforts, it\r\nwill take many years to complete. Unfortunately, a lack\r\nof specialized equipment means that the process cannot\r\nmove any faster. Having said this, allow me to take this\r\nopportunity to express my gratitude to all those who have\r\nthus far provided financial and other aid towards\r\nalleviating the landmine problem in my country, and to\r\nmake a further appeal for any aid — material, financial or\r\nprofessional — which could help us expedite the mine-\r\nclearing process. In this context, I would like to express\r\nmy Government’s appreciation for the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations Mine Action Centre in Zagreb and the\r\nUnited Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs for\r\ntheir efforts in helping us launch this process.\r\nQuality of life, today and in the future, will greatly\r\ndepend on success in the protection of human rights it\r\nboth international and national levels. Protection and\r\npromotion of human rights — a cause in which the\r\nUnited Nations has played an indispensable role — is\r\nnecessary in order to guarantee international stability and\r\nsecurity. The Office of the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights has successfully enhanced the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in this important field and, at this\r\njuncture, I would like, on behalf of the Croatian\r\nGovernment, to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson upon\r\nher appointment to this post. Because of her excellent\r\nqualifications and personal integrity, we are confident that\r\nshe will perform her duties admirably.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nMr. Kamara (Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nCroatia’s own human rights situation should be\r\nevaluated in the context of the exceptional circumstances of\r\nits recent history. Despite the trying circumstances of its\r\ninception, the Republic of Croatia has managed to build the\r\nfoundations of a democratic society based on respect for\r\nhuman rights. In this regard, I can announce that in the\r\ncoming month of October Croatia will ratify the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights. There are, of course, many\r\noutstanding issues, largely stemming from the war of\r\naggression waged against Croatia. These include the return\r\nof displaced persons and refugees; identification of missing\r\npersons; the rights of ethnic Croats in neighbouring States;\r\nand the return of all Croatian Serbs who left Croatia at the\r\ninstigation and under the orders of their leaders and who\r\nwish to return to Croatia. The Government of the Republic\r\nof Croatia intends to continue to deal with all these issues\r\nin keeping with its international human rights obligations as\r\nwell as its legitimate concerns for the security of the State\r\nand the safety and welfare of all its citizens.\r\nAs a victim of aggression, Croatia advocates the\r\nneed — and has even come up with its own initiatives —\r\nto set up an international tribunal for the prosecution of war\r\ncrimes committed in Croatia and Bosnian and Herzegovina.\r\nCroatia has been cooperating with the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia since its\r\nfoundation. The Tribunal’s Office has opened in Zagreb.\r\nThe Croatian Government has established its own Office\r\nfor Cooperation with the Tribunal and appointed observers\r\nto the Tribunal. Moreover, the Constitutional Law on\r\nCooperation with the International Tribunal has been\r\nadopted. Croatia’s principled position is to cooperate with\r\nthe Tribunal within its obligations as defined in\r\ninternational law and in accordance with the relevant\r\nresolutions and the statute of the Tribunal adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nHowever, Croatia cannot be completely satisfied with\r\nthe work of the Hague Tribunal to date. The charges raised\r\nso far, and the ethnic composition of the persons being tried\r\nin The Hague at present, do not properly reflect the\r\nresponsibility of the sides involved in the conflict or the\r\nextent of the war crimes committed. On the other hand, by\r\ntrying to subpoena the States and their high officials, the\r\nTribunal has gone beyond its own statute and international\r\nlaw.\r\nCurrent peace operations in the territory of Croatia —\r\nUNTAES and UNMOP — are considered successful by my\r\nGovernment. Under the Basic Agreement signed between\r\nthe central authorities of the Republic of Croatia and the\r\nSerbs from the Croatian Danubian region, and pursuant to\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, the two-year\r\nUNTAES mandate expires on 15 January 1998. Croatia\r\nholds that at this moment there are no reasons whatsoever\r\nfor any prolongation of the UNTAES mandate beyond 15\r\nJanuary 1998. We are also firmly convinced that this\r\nmission will be fully completed on time and will go down\r\nin history as one of the most successful United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nThe results achieved under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations and with the full cooperation of the\r\nCroatian authorities can be described as highly\r\nsatisfactory. Demobilization has been completed. Local\r\nelections have been held through which the Croatian\r\nDanubian region has been reintegrated into the legal and\r\npolitical system of the country. Local Government has\r\nlargely been transferred to the newly elected and\r\nconstituted bodies.\r\nRules have been defined and designed in cooperation\r\nbetween the Republic of Croatia, UNTAES and UNHCR\r\nto enable a dignified, safe and organized return of\r\ndisplaced persons and refugees to their homes in and out\r\nof the Croatian Danubian region. So far a total of 1,500\r\ndisplaced Croats have returned to the Croatian Danubian\r\nregion, and a total of 8,000 Serbs have returned from the\r\nregion to their homes elsewhere in Croatia. The return of\r\ndisplaced persons and the international presence will\r\ncontinue after the departure of UNTAES. At the invitation\r\nof the Croatian authorities, the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has undertaken to\r\nmonitor the developments in the Croatian Danubian\r\nregion after 15 January 1998.\r\nThe reintegration of the Croatian Danubian region\r\nhas never been an easy or simple process. The Republic\r\nof Croatia and all its citizens, especially the population of\r\nthe Croatian Danubian region, including the persons\r\nexpelled from it, owe a debt of gratitude to UNTAES and\r\nall the States whose troops have participated in this highly\r\nsuccessful operation.\r\nThe mandate of UNMOP, which has been given the\r\ntask of monitoring the demilitarization of the area from\r\nboth sides of the southernmost border between the\r\nRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, has been helpful in stabilizing security in that\r\narea and in creating conditions for a lasting settlement\r\nthere through bilateral talks. The Republic of Croatia has\r\nshown full understanding for the interests of the Federal\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia with regard to the security of the\r\nBoka Kotorska Bay, while being concerned for its own\r\nsecurity in the Dubrovnik hinterland. In this regard,\r\nUNMOP has played an important role, but it will not be\r\npossible to deal with the outstanding problems through\r\nendless prolongations of the United Nations mandate.\r\nWith relief and satisfaction, Croatia welcomes the\r\neasing of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and remains\r\nfirmly committed to the principles and implementation of\r\nthe Washington and Dayton Accords. My Government\r\ngives its active support to preserving the integrity of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, as well as to the consolidation of the\r\nfederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a foothold and\r\nframework for the survival and well-being of the Croatian\r\npeople in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe role of the international community, especially\r\nthat of the United Nations and the countries participating in\r\nSFOR, in the creation of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nis irreplaceable at this stage of the peace process. Too much\r\neffort, resources and prestige have been invested in peace\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, and too much suffering has\r\nbeen experienced by the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nto allow any risk which may undermine what has been\r\nachieved in Dayton and in its wake. Croatia will persist and\r\npersevere in its role as an active peace agent in the region,\r\nexpecting other parties involved in the peace process to\r\nfulfil their obligations.\r\nThose standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and\r\ncontinuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nas a community of two equal entities and three constituent\r\npeoples have to be confronted with the same\r\nuncompromising determination of the international\r\ncommunity, and, if required, with the same measures as\r\nwere earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\r\nproved to be entirely necessary and productive. The\r\neconomic reconstruction of the country — in which the\r\ninternational community should play an even more vital\r\nrole — is also of special importance.\r\nThe agenda of the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly is extensive, and a great deal of work lies ahead\r\nof us. There is also an opportunity before us to have this\r\nsession of the General Assembly recorded in the annals of\r\nthe Organization as a landmark in the Organization\u0027s\r\ndevelopment. Croatia will be only too glad to help make\r\nthis come true.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker on my list is the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Italy, His Excellency Mr. Lamberto Dini, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Dini (Italy): I warmly congratulate Minister\r\nUdovenko on his election to the helm of the fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly. His profound\r\nexperience in international affairs is the best guarantee for\r\nthe success of his mandate. Allow me also to thank his\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, who led the fifty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly with great\r\ndistinction.\r\nOn all the broad issues confronting the General\r\nAssembly, Italy supports the statement made on Tuesday\r\nby the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nToday we have a historic opportunity to connect\r\nprinciples and reality, give life to our ideals and shape\r\nthis Organization for decades to come. The ideologies that\r\ndivided humankind in this century have crumbled.\r\nMeanwhile, the system engineered with such foresight by\r\nthe founding Members amidst the horrors of the most\r\ndevastating war the world has ever seen has maintained\r\nand increased its significance.\r\nWe no longer live in a world of purely national\r\ninterests. More and more, policy-making is informed by\r\nglobal concerns such as human rights, solidarity and\r\nsocial justice. At the threshold of the twenty-first century,\r\nlet us pledge to settle religious and ethnic conflicts\r\nthrough dialogue, tolerance and cultural exchange, and to\r\nfind collective answers to international terrorism,\r\norganized crime, drug trafficking and the degradation of\r\nthe environment. We can join forces to eradicate poverty,\r\nwhich is a major cause of social injustice and political\r\nturmoil in the world, and guarantee dignity, respect and\r\nbetter living standards for every human being.\r\nThe goals of a new world order, founded on mutual\r\ntrust and the rejection of the threat and use of force, are\r\npeace, security, sustainable development and respect for\r\nthe fundamental freedoms of the individual. But these\r\nvalues cannot be dictated by an elite group of States. The\r\nfuture of humankind is the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nAs the United Nations prepares to meet the\r\nchallenges of the third millennium, the General Assembly\r\nhas a role of paramount importance to play.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nAt the opening of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly there was unanimous consensus on the need for\r\na far-reaching reform of the United Nations system. In my\r\naddress I stated that if the United Nations was to respond\r\neffectively to the growing concerns that had emerged,\r\nreform could no longer be postponed. The international\r\ncommunity requires higher standards of security,\r\ndevelopment and democracy, and it needs them now.\r\nOn that occasion, I listed 10 specific proposals to\r\nmake United Nations peacekeeping operations more\r\neffective, and I am glad to see that progress has been made\r\non some of them. Procedures for periodic meetings between\r\nthe Security Council and troop-contributing countries have\r\nbeen consolidated. To help the Organization respond to\r\ncrises where and when they arise, Italy recently became the\r\nsixth country to formalize its participation in standby\r\narrangements for United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nPresident Clinton said in his speech on Monday that\r\nthe first task of the United Nations must remain the pursuit\r\nof peace and security. When a situation of serious\r\ninstability developed in Albania last March, the Security\r\nCouncil — with the full support of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral — acted promptly, authorizing a coalition of the\r\ncountries, led by Italy, willing to form a Multinational\r\nProtection Force. During the four months of its mandate,\r\nOperation Alba enabled the safe delivery of humanitarian\r\nassistance, created a secure environment for the missions of\r\ninternational organizations, and made democratic elections\r\npossible. In short, it helped put the country back on its feet.\r\nOne of the keys to its success was an innovative approach\r\nto peacekeeping, involving the rapid planning and\r\ndeployment of the Force, and close coordination among the\r\nparticipating countries and the host country, under the\r\nconstant monitoring of the United Nations.\r\nTo consolidate the gains that have been made and lay\r\nthe foundations for Albania\u0027s growth and prosperity, the\r\nnext step is to rehabilitate the State institutions and\r\neconomy. With this in mind, the Italian Government has\r\nconvened a ministerial conference for October, in Rome,\r\nwith the participation of the Albanian Government and all\r\nthe relevant international organizations to assess needs and\r\ndecide on a common course of action.\r\nFor over half a century, the United Nations has been\r\nseeking to establish a permanent international criminal court\r\nto prosecute and punish genocide, war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity, wherever and by whomever they are\r\ncommitted. This is a test of our collective responsibility,\r\nmade even more pressing by the terrible massacres that\r\nhave characterized recent ethnic conflicts, and Italy\r\nconfirms its strong support, pledges its active contribution\r\nto this endeavour, and is prepared to host in Rome the\r\ndiplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the\r\ninternational criminal court.\r\nA second major challenge is arms control. Before\r\ndealing with the security requirements of tomorrow, we\r\nmust stop living by the fears of yesterday. New standards\r\nof security can be produced only through international\r\ncooperation under the leadership of the United Nations.\r\nItaly has some of the world\u0027s strictest and most\r\nadvanced legislation on the export of arms. I am proud to\r\nreport that this past June the Italian Government\r\nunilaterally decided to renounce the production, export,\r\nstockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines, and\r\nenabling legislation to this effect has already been passed\r\nby one branch of our Parliament. But the full value of\r\nthis commitment can only be realized if it is shared by all\r\ncountries, whether or not they are parties to the Ottawa\r\nprocess. The recent Oslo conference, to be sure, made\r\nremarkable accomplishments, but they are not yet\r\nuniversal. To achieve this goal, our efforts should be\r\ncomplemented by the continuing involvement of the\r\nConference on Disarmament.\r\nTwo months ago, Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\npresented a package of ground-breaking proposals to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of the Organization and\r\nenhance its ability to meet the new challenges. Those\r\nproposals deserve our full support.\r\nOne important goal of the Secretary General\u0027s reform\r\nplan is to energize the strategic direction provided by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. To this end, we need to streamline the\r\nagenda and identify priorities for consideration in the short-\r\nand medium-term. Since the time available for plenary\r\ndebates is limited, we should focus on matters of general\r\ninterest.\r\nThe reform of the Organization is a question of the\r\nhighest priority for the current session of the General\r\nAssembly, as the Secretary-General himself has\r\nunderlined. In the coming months, two other major\r\nsubjects also command our attention: the financial\r\nsituation of the Organization, and the structure and\r\ncomposition of the Security Council.\r\nTo function properly, the Organization has to be able\r\nto rely on adequate resources. Assessed contributions\r\nmust be paid in full, on time and without conditions by\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nMember States. Italy, for its part, has always complied with\r\nthis fundamental rule. Nevertheless, we believe that the\r\ntime has come to agree on a realistic new scale of\r\nassessments, based on Member States\u0027 capacity to pay and\r\nmaking the Organization less dependent on the\r\ncontributions of a single country.\r\nHowever, let there be no confusion about our support\r\nfor a review of the scale of assessments. There can be\r\nabsolutely no link between Members\u0027 contributions and\r\nSecurity Council reform, lest the impression be created that\r\npermanent seats are up for sale.\r\nThis brings me to the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThere is broad agreement that reform is needed to bring the\r\nCouncil more in line with the new realities of the world in\r\nwhich we live. The reform must be inspired by the\r\nprinciples of democracy, equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and transparency. These are the very\r\nprinciples guiding the proposal presented by Italy. While\r\nwe are prepared to look constructively at other proposals,\r\nwe must guard against those advocating a system that\r\nwould divide Member States into four categories: first-class\r\ncountries — the five current permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, with veto power; second-class\r\ncountries — the new permanent members from\r\nindustrialized nations, without veto power; third-class\r\ncountries — “pseudo-permanent” rotating members, without\r\nveto power, from developing nations in different regions;\r\nand fourth-class countries — the overwhelming majority of\r\nUnited Nations Member States, with fewer chances than\r\never of serving on the Security Council.\r\nSuch stratification of membership, reminiscent of the\r\ncaste system in ancient empires, would defy the\r\nfundamental principles of logic and democracy, and\r\nmarginalize some of the countries most active in the\r\nOrganization. How could any of us accept relegation to the\r\nlast of these categories and go back to our people and\r\nParliaments and tell them that we actually voted in favour\r\nof our country\u0027s demotion to fourth-class status? Let me\r\nstress that this type of problem would not be generated by\r\nthe Italian proposal, which calls for an increase only in\r\nnon-permanent members, to be democratically elected by\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nAnother aspect of reform is the question of the veto.\r\nThis cannot and should not be discussed independently of\r\nthe issue of enlarging the Council. The two issues are\r\ninseparable. Indeed, every aspect of Security Council\r\nreform should be addressed at the same time and in the\r\nsame context. Before determining the future size of the\r\nCouncil and the names of new members, we must define\r\nthe criteria that should govern the reform. Ad hoc\r\napproaches will not work. Ultimately, no solution can be\r\nadopted unless there is broad consensus. And a lasting\r\nand equitable outcome cannot be reached through hasty\r\nand partial solutions. Forcing the issue would deepen\r\ndivisions and jeopardize the larger and more urgent\r\nquestion before the General Assembly: approving the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s reform package.\r\nIn a longer-term perspective, I would like to add that\r\na fact-finding inquiry recently conducted by the Italian\r\nParliament envisaged a permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the European Union, as a natural evolution of\r\nits common foreign and security policy.\r\nAlmost 55 years ago, on November 13 1942,\r\nPresident Roosevelt said that the future of the United\r\nNations association\r\n“should not be restricted to the 28 signatories of the\r\nAtlantic Charter, but should be one which all nations\r\ncould join.”\r\nPresident Roosevelt believed that the purpose of the\r\nUnited Nations should not be the defence of the status\r\nquo and that its strength did not lie in sheer numbers, but\r\nin the way that Member States engaged in collective\r\ndeliberations and action. This vision should guide our\r\npursuit of a more promising future for all the people of\r\nthis world. History will not be lenient with us if we fail.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Romania, His Excellency Mr. Adrian\r\nSeverin.\r\nMr. Severin (Romania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): At the outset, I would like to extend to Mr.\r\nUdovenko our most sincere congratulations on his\r\nelection to the high office of President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session, as a representative\r\nboth of a neighbourly and friendly country and of a\r\nregion that has significantly increased its presence in the\r\nUnited Nations family in recent years. At such a decisive\r\nmoment for the future of our Organization, he has a\r\nmandate of high responsibility and I offer him our full\r\nsupport.\r\nIt is a great honour for me to address, for the first\r\ntime, this prestigious forum, with its wide participation\r\nand global vocation, in my capacity as the representative\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nof a coalition Government that arose 10 months ago in a\r\ndemocratic transition of power. From the outset, I would\r\nassure the Assembly that the new Romanian Government,\r\nin its strategy of consolidating the rule of law and a free-\r\nmarket economy, means to cooperate with and rely on the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. We are\r\ninterested in making the Organization capable of reacting\r\nmore rapidly and efficiently to the current needs of Member\r\nStates and to the new global challenges at this twilight of\r\nthe millennium.\r\nA few weeks ago, the Romanian Government, with\r\nsupport from the United Nations Development Programme,\r\nconvened in Bucharest the third International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies. The Conference focused on\r\nthe link between democracy and human centred\r\ndevelopment, both as a subject and as the target of political\r\naction, a theme of great interest that is currently enjoying\r\ntop priority on the United Nations agenda.\r\nIn my capacity as Acting President of the Conference,\r\nI have the honour to submit to the Assembly’s attention the\r\ndocument containing its proceedings and results.\r\nGovernment representatives from 77 States and, for the first\r\ntime, non-governmental actors of civil societies, along with\r\n14 international organizations, examined in a constructive\r\nand positive manner the current status and future issues of\r\nthe process of consolidating their democratic systems and\r\nadopted by consensus a review and a set of\r\nrecommendations, distributed as an official document of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session.\r\nThese recommendations spell out the need for good\r\ngovernance and for broad participation by civil society in\r\nthe democratic exercise, as well as for strengthening\r\ndemocratic institutions in order to face the challenges\r\ngenerated by globalization, corruption and organized crime.\r\nAt the same time, Romania believes that it is of the utmost\r\nimportance to ensure the continuity of the Bucharest\r\nConference’s efforts and its practical consequences. That is\r\nwhy, in keeping with the recommendations advanced in\r\nBucharest, we suggest that a follow-up mechanism be\r\nestablished for the consolidation process of new or restored\r\ndemocracies.\r\nWe plan to continue consultations with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and with interested States and international\r\norganizations on these themes and on the proposal to\r\nconvene a summit of the new or restored democracies in\r\nthe year 2000.\r\nI am confident that the results of the Bucharest\r\nConference will act as points of reference in the debates\r\nof the current session. We shall work for the adoption by\r\nthe General Assembly of a resolution reaffirming the\r\nsupport of the United Nations system for the efforts of\r\nGovernments to consolidate the new or restored\r\ndemocracies.\r\nIn line with the collective commitment we made at\r\nthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary ceremonies, we are\r\namong those who believe that the strengthening of the\r\nOrganization’s capacity to respond adequately to the new\r\nneeds and challenges of the twenty-first century is of\r\nhighest priority. It is in the interests of our Organization\r\nto achieve, even at this session, realistic and balanced\r\nresults, of mutual interest and the widest possible benefit,\r\nto enhance its credibility and viability. We welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on a programme for reform\r\nand we assure him of our confidence and support in\r\nachieving its objectives.\r\nWe associate ourselves with the European Union’s\r\nposition. Indeed, reform should be not a cost-cutting\r\nexercise, but rather a matter of strengthening the\r\nOrganization’s role as an active and efficient world\r\nforum. Our objective is to make the United Nations more\r\nefficient, more transparent, more responsible and, last but\r\nnot least, more credible.\r\nWe also believe that the dividends obtained through\r\nbetter financial and personnel management — the so-\r\ncalled “dividends of reform” — should be reallocated to\r\ndevelopment activities for the developing countries. It is\r\nin this spirit that the delegation of Romania will take part\r\nin the reform process and cooperate with all interested\r\ndelegations in identifying solutions enabling the General\r\nAssembly to reach a general agreement on a coherent and\r\nconstructive response to the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals.\r\nWe have the opportunity today to live in a world\r\nawakened from the cold-war nightmare that divided us\r\nirreconcilably into friends and enemies, a world of\r\ncommunications and interaction in which closed societies\r\ncannot survive. Increasing globalization should help us to\r\nknow each other better and bring us closer together to\r\nbuild common projects. We are even invited to rethink\r\nour global society, the relations among us and the\r\ndirection of our political actions. A new political\r\nphilosophy, the philosophy of partnership, asserts itself in\r\nthe context of relations between States, whereby what a\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\ncountry gains is added to and not deducted from its\r\npartner’s benefit.\r\nThis philosophy was promoted in the last half century\r\nin European and Euro-Atlantic structures, with\r\nacknowledged positive results in the field of stability and\r\ncooperation on the continent. This is also why Central and\r\nEastern European countries are naturally keen to integrate\r\nthemselves into such structures.\r\nThat is also the philosophy Romania uses as a basis in\r\ndeveloping a solidarity and cooperation policy at the\r\nsubregional, regional and international levels aimed at\r\nconsolidating and activating stability in its geographic\r\nregion and throughout the world. We have tried fully to\r\nnormalize relations with our neighbours, and we have\r\nproposed trilateral cooperation plans to our partners in the\r\nregion. At the same time, we launched the idea of reviving\r\nthe traditional commercial routes to Northern Europe and\r\nCentral Asia. The same concept of building a network of\r\ncommunication and mutually beneficial cooperation is the\r\nbasis for the development of economic cooperation in the\r\nBlack Sea region and for our involvement in the Central\r\nEuropean Initiative, the Central European Free Trade\r\nAgreement, the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative\r\nand so forth.\r\nThe participation of Romania in the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping Mission in Angola, in the stabilization efforts\r\nof operation Alba in Albania and in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, under the auspices of the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO), are testimony to our political\r\nwillingness to act as a stabilization factor. At the same\r\ntime, I would like to point out that Romania is ready to\r\nincrease its contribution to the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\r\nin Bosnia and to contribute to other similar actions, such as\r\nthe United Nations Preventive Deployment Force\r\n(UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia and other forces that remain necessary in that\r\narea.\r\nAll these efforts to establish an environment of\r\nconfidence and cooperation that generates peace and\r\nsecurity in Central and South-East Europe, as well as in\r\nsome hot spots of the world, reveal not only a new\r\napproach, but also a new stage that Romania is passing\r\nthrough on its way from totalitarianism to democracy. In\r\nthe current “post-transition” phase, the results achieved in\r\nthe democratic processes and economic reform, which have\r\nbeen recognized by the international community and\r\nfinancial institutions, qualify Romania legitimately to play\r\na clearer and more active role in defining and designing\r\ncommon projects of security and progress in the region\r\nand in the world, including within the United Nations and\r\nits specialized agencies.\r\nI would like to make a few remarks on some other\r\nimportant items on the agenda.\r\nFrom the experience we have gained in our region\r\nand in neighbouring regions — Central and South-East\r\nEurope, the Middle East and the Caucasus — it can be\r\nconcluded that poverty, the absence or weakness of\r\ninstitutions that are characteristic of the modern\r\ndemocratic State and distrust are among the causes of\r\ncrises and conflict situations. Specific steps by the United\r\nNations system and the entire international community are\r\nrequired to eradicate poverty. They should be aimed at\r\nsupporting the countries of the region that are confronted\r\nwith this phenomenon so that they can increase their\r\nproduction through the adequate use of their own specific\r\nresources and economic capabilities. Hampering such a\r\nprocess can have only negative consequences in the field\r\nof security and stability.\r\nWith regard to strengthening institutions that are part\r\nof a State based on the rule of law, it is necessary to\r\ncreate, alongside rapid-reaction forces for peacekeeping,\r\na so-called civilian rapid-reaction force to support the\r\nestablishment of institutions capable of maintaining State\r\norder and coherence in an open and free society.\r\nBuilding up confidence involves dialogue and\r\ncommunication, as well as the elimination of any form of\r\nisolation. The United Nations should be efficiently\r\ninvolved in the dismantlement of terrorist infrastructures\r\nall over the world. At the same time, it is necessary to\r\ngive up rhetoric and spectacular gestures in favour of\r\ndirect negotiations between the interested parties, in a\r\nquiet and discreet atmosphere.\r\nWe would like to point out the importance Romania\r\nattaches to dialogue conducive to solutions negotiated by\r\nthe parties directly involved, be it in the Middle East,\r\nCyprus or the former Yugoslavia. It is our firm belief,\r\nparticularly since our latest political contacts in the\r\nMiddle East and in Bucharest, that the resumption of\r\nnegotiations between the interested parties, based on the\r\nprinciples agreed in the Madrid and Oslo accords, is the\r\nonly way to achieve an equitable and lasting peace in the\r\nregion.\r\nWe welcome and support the recent United States\r\ninitiative, as well as the efforts of other countries, to\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nunblock the peace process. We also welcome the direct\r\nnegotiations, under the auspices of the United Nations,\r\nbetween the two communities of Cyprus with a view to an\r\nequitable and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue, and we\r\nexpress our willingness to take part in the peacekeeping\r\noperation in that country.\r\nAs main guarantor of peace and international security,\r\nthe United Nations should play an active role in crisis\r\nprevention and management, using preventive diplomacy\r\nand, when necessary, peacekeeping operations. Romania\r\nwill support such United Nations actions and intends to\r\ndiversify its contribution by including civilian components\r\nin its contributions.\r\nIn the field of arms control and disarmament, we\r\nconsider that the United Nations can and should set an\r\nexample of change in concept and approach that go beyond\r\nthe vestiges of the bloc mentality and lead to arms control\r\nand disarmament solutions capable of ensuring global\r\nsecurity, with the existence of several centres of economic\r\nand cultural power. We attach special importance to nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation issues, including the negotiation of a\r\ntreaty to ban the production of fissionable materials for\r\nmilitary purposes, the implementation of the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention, the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional arms and the processes aimed at banning anti-\r\npersonnel landmines.\r\nThe debates on economic and social issues should\r\ncreate the foundations for the necessary relaunching of the\r\nNorth-South dialogue on development, as such issues have\r\nbeen largely ignored in the context of the political\r\ndevelopments subsequent to the collapse of the Soviet bloc\r\nand the end of the cold war or on matters linked to the\r\nexpansion of NATO and the European Union. Our debates\r\nwill have to take into account the recent trends in world\r\neconomy — such as high rates of growth, far exceeding\r\nthose of gross world product achieved by world trade;\r\ntransportation; and the volume of direct investment and\r\ninternational financial transactions — and the necessity of\r\nensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing\r\ncountries to the developed countries’ markets and enhanced\r\ncooperation on third markets. All these elements call for a\r\nconceptual reconsideration of the development process that\r\ngives due attention to the social component and ensures the\r\nparticipation of the main actors: Governments, private\r\nsectors, transnational corporations and civil society. In this\r\nrespect, we suggest that thought be given to the idea of\r\nsetting up a social solidarity fund to help disadvantaged\r\npersons and support the integration of unemployed and\r\nmarginalized persons into productive activities.\r\nThe Romanian economy has reached macroeconomic\r\nstability, by decreasing the inflation rate and the\r\nbudgetary deficit, and started structural reform, in\r\nparticular in the agricultural sector. Consistent efforts are\r\nbeing made to speed up privatization and attract foreign\r\ninvestors. With all this going on, we are interested in\r\nparticipating in a debate that can highlight measures\r\nenvisaged by Governments for what the Managing\r\nDirector of the International Monetary Fund recently\r\ncalled “second generation reform”, which will focus on\r\nmicroeconomics and social protection policies.\r\nWe believe that development assistance requires new\r\nand increased mobilization from the international\r\ncommunity, and we favour enhanced coherence in the\r\ncountry programmes undertaken by United Nations bodies\r\nand funds, and more efficient use of resources allocated\r\nfor development.\r\nIn view of the new threats facing our societies and\r\ninstitutions, we support measures aimed at strengthening\r\nthe capacity of the United Nations in international drug\r\ncontrol and the fight against corruption and organized\r\ncrime. We welcome the establishment in Vienna of a\r\nsingle Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, as\r\nwell as the convening, in 1998, of a special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on drug control. Furthermore, we\r\npropose consideration of the United Nations declaring an\r\ninternational year for the fight against corruption and\r\norganized crime. This major issue could also be the\r\nsubject of a special high-level segment of the General\r\nAssembly. Our objective is to elaborate and put into\r\npractice international cooperation instruments that enable\r\nus to work together to protect ourselves and eradicate\r\nthese scourges.\r\nWe shall soon begin preparations for celebrating, in\r\n1998, the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights. Let us take this opportunity to reaffirm\r\nour firm commitment to the universality of all human\r\nrights, whose promotion and protection should always\r\nremain a priority for the United Nations. We support the\r\nmeasures envisaged by the Secretary-General to\r\nstrengthen the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and we welcome the\r\nappointment of the former Irish President, Mrs. Mary\r\nRobinson, as High Commissioner.\r\nWith regard to administrative and budgetary\r\nquestions, the Romanian delegation is in favour of the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s proposals for the regular budget for\r\nthe 1998-1999 biennium, with the understanding that the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nreductions will not affect the future capacity of the\r\nOrganization to fulfil its mandate. We support the efforts to\r\nimprove the Organization\u0027s financial situation and place it\r\non a sound and predictable footing. It is particularly\r\nimportant that, through open and constructive negotiations,\r\nwe achieve feasible solutions with regard to the future\r\npayments of arrears and a new scale of assessments for the\r\nregular and peacekeeping budgets, thus reflecting the new\r\nrealities and real capacity to pay of each State.\r\nFinally, I assure the Assembly, once again, of the full\r\ncooperation of the Romanian delegation in our joint efforts\r\nto strengthen and enhance the efficiency of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United\r\nArab Emirates, His Excellency Mr. Rashid Abdullah Al-\r\nNoaimi.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): It gives me pleasure to extend to the\r\nPresident and to the members of the General Committee, on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, our\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly. His\r\nexperience and diplomatic skills will undoubtedly contribute\r\nto the success of its work. I would also like to express our\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail,\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Malaysia, who conducted\r\nthe work of the previous session with distinction.\r\nI take this opportunity also to congratulate His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan on his election as Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. We are confident that his\r\nvast experience in international affairs and his competence\r\nand expertise will strengthen the role of the Organization in\r\nachieving international peace and security. I am also\r\npleased to express, once again, our deep appreciation to the\r\nprevious Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, whose efforts had a positive and concrete\r\nimpact on the progress of the work of the world\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe present session is of special importance because\r\nof the major changes taking place on the world scene and\r\nthe attendant far-reaching developments and transitions in\r\nthe political, economic, social and environmental fields.\r\nDespite the state of openness that has characterized\r\ninternational relations, the success achieved in resolving\r\nsome conflicts and the emergence of indications of relative\r\nimprovement in the growth of the world economy, we are\r\nstill facing new types of challenges. The most serious of\r\nthese are reflected in racial, ideological, and ethnic\r\nconflicts and civil wars; the aggravation of poverty\r\nsituations; human rights violations; violence; terrorism;\r\nand drugs. All of these have a negative effect on national\r\nsecurity, the sovereignty of States and economic and\r\nsocial development. These challenges require cooperation\r\nand coordination between States at the bilateral, regional\r\nand international levels.\r\nThe important role played by the United Nations and\r\nits specialized agencies in dealing with these new\r\ndevelopments as a whole is now the major incentive for\r\nconsolidating its permanence, supporting its objectives\r\nand upholding its Charter. This means that, more than\r\never before, we must provide it with the political,\r\nfinancial and moral support that will enable it to respond\r\nappropriately and promptly to emerging global needs.\r\nHaving studied the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the reform and renewal of the United Nations, the\r\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates welcomes in\r\nprinciple its recommendations and proposals aimed at\r\nstrengthening and developing the work of the\r\nOrganization and adapting it to the realities of the\r\npresent-day world. At the same time, however, we wish\r\nto stress the importance of having the reforms reflect the\r\naspirations of the countries of the world, particularly the\r\ndeveloping countries, in achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment and in promoting peace and security,\r\nstability and growth.\r\nWe also support the international efforts aimed at\r\nenlarging and restructuring the Security Council and\r\nimproving its rules of procedure with a view to ensuring\r\nequitable geographical representation and equality among\r\nStates, achieving transparency and objectivity in the\r\nadoption of its resolutions and the follow-up to their\r\nimplementation, and preventing double standards, which\r\nhave proved to be too dangerous in many issues of peace\r\nand security. In addition, we support all proposals calling\r\nfor the strengthening of cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween the General Assembly, the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and for widening the\r\ncircle of dialogue and negotiations with regional\r\norganizations in order to achieve a broader, more\r\neffective and more comprehensive consensus for the\r\nappropriate approach to reform and renewal.\r\nDespite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of\r\nmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past\r\nfew years to contain the devastating effects of the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nconflicts in the Arab Gulf region, which has great\r\nimportance to regional and international strategies, and their\r\ncontinuing endeavour to support progress towards joint\r\nreconstruction and cooperation, the unstable political and\r\nsecurity conditions in the region remain a source of concern\r\nfor us. Such a situation therefore requires the establishment\r\nof a balance based on a firm political will to support all\r\nregional arrangements aimed at eliminating the causes of\r\nconflict and situations of occupation. It also requires\r\nbuilding bridges for multilateral cooperation, at both the\r\nbilateral and the collective level, on the basis of the\r\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence, confidence-building,\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others, mutual\r\nrespect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of\r\ndisputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force, in\r\naccordance with the rules of international law and the\r\nCharters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nand the United Nations.\r\nThe continued occupation since 1971 by the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran of three islands belonging to the United\r\nArab Emirates — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\r\nMusa — is a major issue to which we and the other States\r\nof the region attach great importance. That occupation\r\nconstitutes a source of constant tension, concern and\r\ninstability in the region, particularly as the Iranian\r\nGovernment persists in changing the historic, legal and\r\ndemographic character of the islands by constructing\r\nmilitary and civilian installations and building bases on\r\nthem. Examples of such measures are the construction of a\r\nbranch of Bayan An-Nour University and two airports on\r\nthe occupied islands of Abu Musa and Greater Tunb. Iran\r\nhas also resorted to repeated military exercises conducted\r\nin the territorial waters of the United Arab Emirates,\r\nincluding those off the three islands, thus continuing to\r\nconsolidate its occupation of the islands, persisting in its\r\nprovocative policy and imposing a fait accompli by force.\r\nAll this is in complete disregard of the dangerous\r\nconsequences of this policy for the future and the territorial\r\nintegrity of the region and for the aspirations of its peoples\r\nto peace, stability and the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates expresses grave concern\r\nabout all such illegal actions and practices, which not only\r\nconstitute a flagrant violation of its territorial integrity and\r\nan infringement of its national rights, but are also\r\ncontradictory to the peaceful inclinations of the States of\r\nthe region and the world at large. We therefore renew our\r\ncall to the Islamic Government of Iran to fulfil its legal and\r\npolitical obligations and undo all its unilateral actions in the\r\nthree Emirates islands. This would prove that its intentions\r\nwere good and give credence to its stated policy,\r\nespecially given certain recent statements by some Iranian\r\nofficials calling for the resolution of existing disputes\r\nthrough peaceful means and expressing their desire to\r\nestablish stability and security in the region.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomed the new\r\nIranian Government and its declared orientation,\r\nespecially with regard to the promotion of good-\r\nneighbourly relations, the elimination of tensions and the\r\npeaceful solution of disputes in the region. We hope that\r\nthe Iranian Government will consider all our peaceful\r\ninitiatives in a spirit of objectivity and cooperation. These\r\ninitiatives have already been supported by sister, friendly\r\nand other States, and call either for serious bilateral\r\nnegotiations, without preconditions, to be entered into, or\r\nfor the dispute to be submitted to the International Court\r\nof Justice.\r\nResorting to policies of violence and force,\r\nstockpiling banned weapons and using terrorism to deal\r\nwith the concerns about the political and security balance\r\nin the region must not become an alternative to dialogue\r\nor to efforts to bolster the mechanisms for building peace\r\nand achieving the economic and social development of\r\nthe countries of the region. For this reason, we support all\r\nmeasures taken by the States of the region to protect their\r\nsovereignty, security and territorial integrity.\r\nWe stress the importance of full respect for the\r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq\r\nand consider that the suffering of the Iraqi people should\r\nbe dealt with within the framework of implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995).\r\nWe also urge the Iraqi Government to carry out in\r\nfull all its legal obligations under the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, especially those dealing with the\r\nrelease of all prisoners of war and detainees who are\r\ncitizens of Kuwait and other countries, and the restitution\r\nof Kuwaiti property.\r\nThe peace process in the Middle East is at a perilous\r\njuncture as a result of Israeli Government policies\r\nreneging on most of its obligations with regard to the\r\npeace process and the principle of land for peace, which\r\nare based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973). Such policies constitute a flagrant violation\r\nof humanitarian law, international legitimacy and the\r\naccords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and\r\nthe Government of Israel, as do the ensuing serious\r\nactions, including the expansion of illegal settler activities\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nin Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since\r\n1967, particularly in Jerusalem; the expropriation of\r\nPalestinian lands and the demolition of houses; resort to\r\nalleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of\r\ncollective punishment; and the imposition of an economic\r\nblockade.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates strongly condemns all such\r\nirresponsible Israeli policies and actions, and reiterates the\r\nimportance of continuing the peace process as the only\r\nalternative for the stability and security of that region,\r\nregardless of the obstacles and challenges it is facing. It\r\ncalls upon the international community, especially the\r\nUnited Nations, and the sponsors of the peace process to\r\nshoulder their legal, political, historical and humanitarian\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the Secretary of State of\r\nthe United States of America during her recent tour of the\r\nregion and hope that she will continue her endeavours to\r\nensure that the Palestinian-Israeli accords are implemented\r\nand that negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are\r\nresumed on the basis of the principle of land for peace and\r\nthe inadmissibility of unilateral actions that would only\r\nprejudice the final phase of the negotiations. We also\r\ncommend the tireless efforts of the countries of the\r\nEuropean Union to persuade the Israeli Government to\r\nreverse its policy and seriously abide by all of its\r\ncommitments in the context of the peace accords and\r\ninternational legality, in a manner that would enable the\r\nPalestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights to self-\r\ndetermination, repatriation and the establishment of their\r\nindependent State on their national soil, with Jerusalem its\r\ncapital.\r\nIn the same context, and given that the other Arab\r\nparties adhere to the peace process as a sine qua non\r\nstrategic objective strategy, the Israeli Government must\r\nmake a similarly serious commitment to end its occupation\r\nof, and repeated attacks against, the territory of Lebanon in\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)\r\nand to resume unconditional negotiations on the Syrian and\r\nLebanese tracks so as to ensure its full withdrawal from the\r\nSyrian Arab Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967, as well as\r\nfrom southern Lebanon and the west of the Bekaa valley.\r\nThe requirements of security, stability and a just and\r\nlasting peace in the region are urgent not only for Israel,\r\nbut for all the countries of that region. Consequently, we\r\nemphasize the inalienable right of peoples to resist\r\noccupation and aggression and condemn all forms of\r\nterrorism, whether they are aimed against individuals or\r\npractised by States, because terrorism has a direct impact\r\nin undermining regional and international stability and\r\nsecurity. We also regard the stockpiling of banned\r\nweapons and the threat of their use against other States as\r\nanother dangerous manifestation of terrorism. We\r\ntherefore urge the international community and the\r\nrelevant international organizations to make effective\r\nefforts to render the region of the Middle East and the\r\nArab Gulf a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\r\nincluding nuclear weapons, and to demand that Israel\r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and comply with the international control\r\nand safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency.\r\nEfforts by the United Nations and the regional\r\norganizations to deal with national and regional tensions\r\nand conflicts, as well as with the concomitant destruction\r\nof development infrastructure and human suffering in\r\nsome developing countries, have not resulted in the\r\ncontainment of the causes or extent of such conflicts. In\r\nthe European continent, for example, manifestations of\r\ntension and ethnic and racial bias still persist among some\r\nfactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of the\r\ncontinued pursuit by certain Bosnian Serbs of policies that\r\nconflict with the peaceful solutions of the Dayton peace\r\naccords. There are also situations of tension, insecurity\r\nand conflict battering parts of the continents of Asia and\r\nAfrica, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, the Great Lakes\r\nregion and other areas. It is therefore imperative that\r\nmore effective international and regional efforts be made\r\nin order to find peaceful and objective solutions to those\r\nconflicts. We also call upon the parties directly concerned\r\nto work and cooperate with efforts and endeavours\r\ndesigned to contain such situations in order to achieve\r\npeace and stability at the national and regional levels.\r\nThe first positive results achieved by globalization,\r\ndevelopment and the growth of world trade have not met\r\nthe expectations of countries in advancing and\r\nstrengthening their development or environmental and\r\nsocial policies. This is particularly true in the developing\r\nand least developed regions that continue to suffer from\r\nthe spread of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, as\r\nwell as the burden of foreign debts, in addition to\r\nfluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other\r\nproblems.\r\nThe creation of an equitable and just economic\r\nenvironment built on a foundation of cooperation requires\r\njoint efforts by developing countries on the one hand, and\r\nby developing and developed countries on the other. We\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nmust also take into consideration the special requirements\r\nof the least developed countries, in particular by increasing,\r\nrather than decreasing, official assistance to them and by\r\nlifting existing trade barriers and economic obstacles. This\r\nwould contribute to a sharing of common responsibilities\r\nand interests among them. We also support all efforts aimed\r\nat promoting and enhancing the role of regional and\r\ninternational development organizations, at the forefront of\r\nwhich are the World Trade Organization, the World Bank\r\nand others, each within its own mandate, in the\r\nimplementation of a global strategy for comprehensive\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn seeking to enhance its participation in such regional\r\nand international institutions, the United Arab Emirates,\r\nthanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State, His\r\nHighness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, has achieved\r\na qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental,\r\neconomic, social, environmental and human fields in the\r\npast two decades. It contributed, to a large degree, to the\r\nexpansion of the bases for investment,\r\ncommerce, industry and the liberalization of trade. It\r\ntherefore continued to provide development assistance to\r\nthe developing and least developed countries, including,\r\nfor example, humanitarian assistance and concessional\r\nloans provided by the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, the\r\nZayed Benevolent Society and other multipurpose\r\nhumanitarian institutions. Within the framework of our\r\ncommitment to enhancing the contribution of the private\r\nsector in supporting the activities of the United Nations,\r\nwe are pleased to announce that we shall be hosting a\r\nconference on the role of the private sector in supporting\r\nthe United Nations, which is scheduled to be held in the\r\nEmirate of Dubai in mid-October. That will be in line\r\nwith our policy of continuing to hold a series of\r\nmultifaceted regional and international conferences and\r\nexhibitions in the cultural, social, economic, political and\r\nenvironmental fields. All these are regarded as\r\ncomplementing the United Nations efforts in the various\r\nareas of sustainable development.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress the need to\r\nadopt values of security, peace and freedom as the\r\nformula for attaining a deeper understanding and a more\r\ncomprehensive view of the issues of our common destiny.\r\nLet us, then, unite our efforts in building a world based\r\non respect for the rule of law and justice, a world where\r\npeace, tolerance, prosperity and progress reign supreme.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n24\r\n"
