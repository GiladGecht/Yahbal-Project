(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Fabián Alarcón Rivera, President of\r\nthe Republic of Ecuador\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Fabián Alarcón Rivera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador, His Excellency\r\nMr. Fabián Alarcón Rivera, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Alarcón Rivera (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am honoured to extend to you, Sir, on behalf\r\nof the Government and the people of Ecuador, warm\r\ncongratulations on your election to preside over this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that your\r\nefforts will contribute to the advancement of the activities\r\nof our Organization. You may rely on the constant and\r\nresolute cooperation of Ecuador.\r\nI should like to speak of several matters of interest\r\nto the international community that the United Nations\r\nhas incorporated into its working agenda. My country\r\nfollows with interest their development within the\r\nOrganization and will act on the basis of the principles\r\nthat guide Ecuador’s foreign policy.\r\nEcuador believes that the search for general and\r\ncomplete global disarmament is a goal that our\r\nOrganization should pursue indefatigably. This is not a\r\nutopian ideal but, rather, a constant objective that\r\nrequires the active participation of all States within a\r\nglobal ethical context. True to this principle, my\r\ncountry is a party to all international and regional\r\ninstruments related to disarmament.\r\nThe nations of the world have welcomed the end\r\nof the cold war and the attendant reduction of the risk\r\nof nuclear holocaust. Nevertheless, Ecuador views with\r\napprehension the persistence of nuclear-weapon-\r\ndevelopment programmes and the continued existence\r\nof large atomic arsenals and the risks they pose for the\r\npeace and well-being of all. The international\r\ncommunity cannot relax its guard and cease to insist on\r\nthe elimination of such means of massive and\r\nindiscriminate destruction. This conviction has led\r\nEcuador to lend its determined support to the global\r\nnon-proliferation regimen and to the establishment of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones. Thus, at the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly, Ecuador was a sponsor of the\r\nresolution calling for the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the southern hemisphere and\r\nadjacent areas.\r\nFurthermore, Ecuador supports the work of the\r\nConference on Disarmament in drawing up a draft text\r\nfor a convention on the control of fissionable material,\r\nwhich is to be submitted to the General Assembly, and\r\nfully agrees with the working document submitted by\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nmembers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries\r\nconcerning the universal nature of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nWith regard to weapons of mass destruction,\r\ndisarmament has particular significance for the whole of\r\nthe international community. However, we cannot\r\noverlook the fact that the subject of conventional\r\ndisarmament is equally sensitive and that it is an issue\r\nthat must attract the full and determined attention of the\r\nUnited Nations. For this reason, Ecuador welcomes the\r\nDisarmament Commission’s decision to include in its\r\nagenda an item on guidelines for control, limitation and\r\ndisarmament in connection with conventional weapons,\r\nwith special attention to the consolidation of peace within\r\nthe context of General Assembly resolution 51/45 N.\r\nEcuador also supports the convening in 1999 of the\r\nfourth special session of the General Assembly devoted\r\nto disarmament, in accordance with the decision taken at\r\nthe Assembly’s last session. My country is especially\r\ninterested in including in the agenda of that special\r\nsession such relevant issues as the effective reduction of\r\nconventional forces and weapons, the relationship\r\nbetween disarmament and development, and confidence-\r\nbuilding measures among States.\r\nBecause of their humanitarian cost, I must refer to a\r\nspecific type of conventional weapon: anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. Ecuador is a contracting party to several\r\ninternational agreements that ban and restrict the use of\r\nsuch weapons, and we urge all countries, whether\r\nsignatories to those treaties or not, to observe them and\r\nscrupulously respect their terms.\r\nMy country is convinced that the community of\r\nStates must persist in its efforts to reach agreement on\r\nthe total prohibition of the use, production, stockpiling,\r\nand transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Ecuador thus\r\nsupports the Ottawa process, which is to conclude in\r\nDecember 1997 with the signing of a binding agreement\r\non a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.\r\nHumankind has painfully come to realize that\r\ninternational peace and security cannot be based on\r\natomic equilibrium, arms races or mistrust and mutual\r\nsuspicion. On the contrary, genuine peace must be based\r\non respect for the rule of law, on the acceptance of the\r\nsolidarity and interdependence of all States and on the\r\ncommon desire to move dynamically forward towards the\r\nsolution of the critical problems of dire poverty, disease,\r\nunemployment, illiteracy and economic and social\r\ninequality among peoples and nations. In order to make\r\nprogress, we must recognize and live by universal\r\nethical principles and seek peaceful solutions to our\r\nmultilateral and bilateral problems through peaceful\r\nprocesses, through dialogue and reconciliation.\r\nThe countries of Latin America, and Ecuador in\r\nparticular, are concerned by the fact that economic\r\ndevelopment is not accompanied by social development.\r\nIt is ironic that in an ever wealthier world,\r\ndevelopment-cooperation resources have fallen\r\n20 per cent in real terms in recent years. How, then,\r\ncan the international community fulfil the commitments\r\nentered into at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment?\r\nWe, the developing countries, assume our\r\nresponsibility in fighting poverty, providing better\r\nhealth and education to our people, reinforcing our\r\ndemocracies and consolidating our institutions.\r\nHowever, it is essential that international cooperation\r\nfor development be continued, since this will result in a\r\nmore just, stable and peaceful world.\r\nThere is no doubt that in recent years the world\r\nhas changed dramatically. We have moved from an\r\ninternational society where political and military\r\nconfrontation weighed heavily on relations to a system\r\nwhere cooperation and dialogue among the great\r\nPowers have gradually eased the fear of a nuclear\r\nholocaust. In this new environment of international\r\nrelations, in which economic questions have become\r\nglobal in nature, the United Nations must also modify\r\nsome of its previous patterns of conduct and\r\nmanagement.\r\nWhat do we want from the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century? The Secretary-General has\r\nsubmitted a comprehensive programme for the reform\r\nof the United Nations system, a programme that must\r\nbe profoundly and carefully analysed by all Member\r\nStates, and Ecuador will actively participate in the\r\ndebate on this subject.\r\nIt must be pointed out that this world body must\r\nconfront the great challenges to mankind, such as the\r\npromotion of economic and social development along\r\nwith the needed preservation of the environment; the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and harmony; the\r\nachievement of total and complete disarmament; the\r\npromotion of human rights; and the strengthening of\r\ncooperation among all nations to eradicate poverty.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nSince its establishment, the United Nations has\r\nfulfilled a number of the purposes for which it was\r\ncreated. It is true that the Organization, for various\r\nreasons largely attributable to Member States themselves,\r\nhas not fulfilled some of the high expectations of the\r\ninternational community. It is worth noting that one of\r\nthe most accurate phrases ever uttered in this forum\r\nrecognizes that the United Nations is exactly what its\r\nMembers want it to be. The successes and failures of the\r\nOrganization are the successes and failures of the States\r\nthat make it up. I do not wish to start listing past errors,\r\nbut we should not forget them, because they can serve as\r\nuseful lessons. We must above all be aware that today\r\nthere are new challenges, and that we must look ahead\r\nand face them.\r\nWe must design an Organization which, through\r\npractical mechanisms, leaves rhetoric aside and assumes a\r\ndynamic role in the solution of world problems. This will\r\nrequire substantial reform of the working methods of the\r\nUnited Nations. Furthermore, it will require a new\r\nattitude by Member States in order to create a just and\r\nequitable international society based on the authentic,\r\ndemocratically expressed will of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFor the Organization to respond more effectively to\r\nthe challenges now facing the international community,\r\nthese reforms should not be restricted to a single sector\r\nwithin the institutional structure. Let me mention the\r\nreform of one of the most important organs of the United\r\nNations: the Security Council. Ecuador attaches particular\r\nimportance to the reform of that body as part of the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. We believe that the\r\nultimate objective of these efforts must be to develop a\r\nmore democratic, transparent and truly representative\r\nworking system for the Council.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must not be\r\nlimited to a mere discussion of the number of members\r\nor of how many delegations should represent each\r\nregion — although here we believe that the number of\r\nSecurity Council members must be increased in the light\r\nof the new world realities, to obtain a more significant\r\npresence of developing countries in accordance with\r\nequitable geographical distribution. We also believe that\r\nreal reform of the Security Council should aim above all\r\nat ensuring that decision-making machinery and processes\r\nhave the transparency, effectiveness and pluralism that\r\nmust characterize every democratic institution. This\r\nincludes, among other specific measures, the limitation of\r\nthe veto power of the Council\u0027s permanent members, and\r\ntimelier and more effective action to prevent\r\ninternational conflicts at the request of any State\r\nMember of the Organization.\r\nAs we approach the end of the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law, I would like to reaffirm\r\nour hope that its objectives will be fully met,\r\nparticularly those relating to the promotion of and\r\nrespect for the principles of international law and to the\r\nbroadest possible recourse to ways and means for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States. We\r\nknow that complex international disputes cannot be\r\nsettled solely by legal mechanisms, but it is no less true\r\nthat any settlement must be based on legal instruments\r\nand must follow formal procedures.\r\nAn essential element of Ecuador\u0027s international\r\npolicy is the search for a just and permanent solution to\r\nthe Ecuador-Peru territorial issue. With the valuable\r\nhelp of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States\r\nas guarantor countries, talks between Ecuador and Peru\r\nare currently under way in Brasilia on the remaining\r\nimpasses that affect our common border, in accordance\r\nwith the commitment of both countries to find a\r\npeaceful and final solution to these issues. Ecuador will\r\ncontinue to participate in these talks, motivated by a\r\ntrue spirit of peace, because we desire a global, final,\r\nhonourable and realistic solution that reflects the\r\nlegitimate expectations of our people, which, together\r\nwith the other peoples of the Americas, are seeking to\r\ncreate a future of mutual benefit and constructive and\r\npeaceful cooperation. The efforts of the Ecuadorian and\r\nPeruvian peoples are aimed at finding a definitive\r\nsolution to this dispute.\r\nInternational interest in the progress of the Brasilia\r\ntalks and the immense prospects that would open for\r\nboth countries in the new millennium are factors that\r\nshould encourage our Governments to make all efforts\r\nnecessary to settle this age-old historical controversy,\r\nand thus respond to the just aspirations to peace and\r\ndevelopment that we all share. Our country longs for\r\npeace and wants peace; it does not want war. We are\r\nconvinced that there is no victory in a war, only\r\ndifferent degrees of defeat owing to the incalculable\r\nconsequences that can affect the political, moral, social\r\nand economic life of our countries.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations states that\r\nworld security is not limited to the significant issue of\r\nthe prevention and settlement of violent conflicts. A\r\nsafer world is also a world where general prosperity\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\neliminates the causes of most conflict and human\r\nsuffering. The United Nations should continue to be a\r\nforum for the discussion of critical issues concerning the\r\nsearch for the economic development of more than three\r\nquarters of the world\u0027s population.\r\nTo be sure, Ecuador is aware that economic growth\r\nper se is not enough to generate adequate social justice\r\nand an equitable distribution of income. My Government\r\nhas designed programmes and plans aimed at covering\r\nthe needs of the marginal populations of Ecuador. With\r\nthe assistance of the World Bank and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, we have established a national\r\nsocial development plan that includes government action\r\nin line with the commitments assumed by the\r\ninternational community during the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development.\r\nThe socially oriented philosophy of my Government\r\nleads me to join those who suggest that the eradication of\r\npoverty throughout the world should be the main goal of\r\nthe international community\u0027s coordinated efforts in the\r\ncoming years. The globalization of the economy cannot\r\nbe limited to the use of cheap labour in the developing\r\nworld, the proliferation of profitable investments and the\r\nexploitation of certain markets. It should also aim at\r\nproviding coordinated and systematic assistance to\r\nimmense populations whose only experience of\r\nglobalization has been their eternal poverty and\r\nfrustration.\r\nSince time immemorial, the inhabitants of Ecuador\r\nhave had special devotion to nature. My country, which\r\nhas one the greatest biodiversity reserves in the world,\r\nhas a deep sense of respect for nature and an awareness\r\nof its value, which are deeply rooted in our traditional\r\nculture. Ecuadorian indigenous communities, for example,\r\npossess ancestral knowledge concerning the rational\r\nmanagement of resources and the preservation of the\r\necosystem.\r\nEcuador is aware of the difficult dilemma faced by\r\nevery society when it comes to choosing between\r\neconomic progress and the preservation of the\r\nenvironment. Given the basic value that the natural\r\nenvironment has for the Ecuadorian people, we have\r\ndedicated all our efforts to preventing, or at least limiting\r\nto the greatest extent possible, the degree of destruction\r\nof nature caused by economic progress.\r\nAs it did during the special session of the General\r\nAssembly held last June, my Government would like to\r\nreiterate its strong commitment to the implementation\r\nof Agenda 21 and to reaching the Agenda\u0027s goals of\r\nsustainable development. The efforts of developing\r\nnations will be successful only if they can secure the\r\neffective support of developed countries through\r\ncompliance with the commitments assumed at the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, the Rio summit. There can be no\r\nuniversal environmental preservation without a genuine\r\nchange in the unsustainable consumption patterns that\r\nbring about the increasing deterioration of the global\r\nenvironment, without adequate financial assistance for\r\ndevelopment in percentages proportional to gross\r\ndomestic product, and without adequate facilities to\r\naccess modern technologies.\r\nThe establishment of new trade and financial\r\nregimes and the urgent need to restructure our\r\neconomies give rise to enormous challenges for\r\ndeveloping countries. We believe that we should\r\nredouble our efforts in order to meet the requirements\r\nof globalization, in such a way that our nations can also\r\nbenefit from the new international economic vigour.\r\nUnlike developed countries, for developing\r\ncountries the globalization process is not only a way to\r\nreactivate productive growth, maintain an upward trend\r\nin stock market indicators or increase business profits.\r\nFor developing countries, the economic aspect of the\r\nso-called globalization should be an opportunity to\r\naccelerate the sustainable development of their peoples,\r\nparticularly with regard to social issues.\r\nIt should be recalled that developing countries\r\nhave made spectacular efforts to adjust to the new\r\neconomic realities. Trade adjustment and liberalization\r\nprogrammes have had strong short-term impacts in\r\nsignificant sectors of our society. Several States have\r\nadopted severe economic measures, hoping that in the\r\nend they will have positive results for all. However, we\r\ncannot help but feel that this attitude contrasts with the\r\nbehaviour of some industrialized countries.\r\nIn trade matters, for example, although some\r\ndeveloped nations insist on the liberalization of trade,\r\nthey persist in keeping various barriers against trade\r\nflows originating in the South. We are not opposed to\r\nthe moderate liberalization of markets regulated by\r\ninternational trade in order to prevent negative effects\r\non sensitive sectors of local economies, but we are\r\nopposed to those who preach freedom of trade for some\r\nand then systematically avoid it for themselves as they\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nsee fit. Developing countries demand a fair, equitable and\r\ntransparent environment for international trade that will\r\nallow us to reap the benefits of economic globalization.\r\nOn the other hand, many developed countries with\r\ninfluence in financial decision-taking circles maintain a\r\npurely economic perspective — as opposed to a wider\r\nsocial vision — of the financial difficulties affecting the\r\ndeveloping world. They continue to associate a nation\u0027s\r\neconomic health with the vigour of its macroeconomic\r\nindicators alone. In fact, no nation can have a healthy\r\neconomy if a significant sector of its population lives in\r\nextreme poverty or if internal growth indicators do not\r\nguarantee a sustainable and continued development in the\r\nfuture. Foreign debt still weighs heavily on my country\r\nand prevents us from reaching the objectives of sustained\r\neconomic and social development and environmental\r\nprotection. With the same constructive spirit as that\r\nwhich guides our trade policies, we are convinced that\r\nthe institutions of the international financial system\r\nshould support developing countries\u0027 efforts to facilitate\r\ntheir economic advancement and fulfil the commitments\r\nof the Earth Summit.\r\nInternational trade and finance, disarmament and\r\nsecurity, environment and development are issues that\r\ncannot be considered separately from one another. We\r\nknow that all the issues in the international agenda are\r\ninterrelated and we address them separately just for\r\nconvenience of consideration. In any case, we must never\r\nlose sight of the principle of globality and interrelation in\r\nthe international agenda, or we may run the risk of\r\nhaving an utterly limited historical perspective and\r\nobjectivity.\r\nAccordingly, Ecuador shares the view of the United\r\nNations Secretary-General on the importance of human\r\nrights in the modern world and that all relevant\r\nprogrammes implemented by the Organization must be\r\nfully integrated within the scope of activities of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the case of Ecuador, I am pleased to inform the\r\nAssembly that one of the principles of my Administration\r\nis to enforce a policy of absolute respect for human\r\nrights. I have the ethical conviction that modern civilized\r\nlife is impossible without individual guarantees and\r\ntolerance for diverging opinions. The Ecuadorian State is\r\ncommitted to following this line of conduct and to\r\npromoting and protecting all human, civil, cultural,\r\neconomic, political and social rights, including the right\r\nto development. We are also committed to encouraging\r\ninquiry procedures in cases of violations of such rights\r\nand to punishing those found liable for them.\r\nThe battle against corruption is one of the essential\r\nobjectives of the National Government in order to\r\nensure that government institutions can recover their\r\nrespectability and the trust which our people is entitled\r\nto place in them.\r\nI wish to refer to a specific aspect related to the\r\nhuman rights issue: the establishment of an international\r\ncriminal court to punish the most serious crimes, such\r\nas genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nEcuador strongly supports this initiative. We share the\r\nview that this court should be established by\r\ninternational convention. We therefore urge all States to\r\nshow the necessary political will to overcome the\r\nremaining technical difficulties in order to convene the\r\nconference of plenipotentiaries charged with approving\r\nthe court\u0027s statutes.\r\nTo conclude, as President of the Republic of\r\nEcuador, I have the pleasure to bring the message of\r\nfriendship and brotherhood of the Ecuadorian people to\r\nthis forum, in which all the nations of the world are\r\nrepresented. Our people has consolidated its democracy\r\nand balanced its economy and is moving boldly forward\r\nto build its future. It is a people that sincerely aspires to\r\nensuring that international mechanisms understand the\r\nrealities of developing countries. Above all, at this\r\nmoment in our history, in the face of any potential\r\nnatural disaster, such as the El Niño phenomenon, we\r\nwould like to count on the timely, effective and direct\r\ncooperation of the United Nations and the various\r\nrelevant international institutions. I wish to extend once\r\nagain our message of friendship and fraternity, as well\r\nas my country\u0027s commitment to the lofty ideals that\r\nguide the efforts of the United Nations in the\r\ninternational sphere.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank His Excellency the President\r\nof the Republic of Ecuador for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Fabián Alarcón Rivera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President\r\nof the Republic of Colombia\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Samper Pizano (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): As President of Colombia and Chairman of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, I would like to extend to you,\r\nSir, my sincere congratulations on your appointment to\r\npreside over this most important session, and I also wish\r\nto thank Ambassador Razali for his diligence in\r\nperforming his duties during the fifty-first session of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nOver the decades the United Nations has shown that\r\nits founders were not mistaken when they entrusted to it\r\nthe mission of developing a new model of co-existence\r\nfor our planet, thanks to which we defeated colonialism,\r\nfought against apartheid, prevented territorial\r\nconfrontations, extended our hand to help children,\r\ndefended the rights of women and protected the\r\nenvironment.\r\nHowever, we find ourselves today at a crossroads\r\nsimilar to that which led us to sign the San Francisco\r\nCharter. The globalization of the world has brought about\r\nthe internationalization of problems such as drug\r\ntrafficking, terrorism and corruption, all of which\r\nseriously threaten our systems.\r\nCertain industrialized nations are behaving selfishly\r\nin defining new rules of the game for free economies.\r\nUnilateralism and conditions imposed by the powerful\r\nupon others are rampant throughout the world. The spare\r\ncapacity of the military industrial complex since the cold\r\nwar is encouraging the beginning of a dangerous arms\r\nrace. The open wound of foreign debt is still an obstacle\r\nto the development of many of the poorest countries. The\r\nviolation of human, political, social and economic rights\r\nis also the order of the day.\r\nThe new United Nations, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has proposed we should reflect upon as the\r\ncentury comes to an end, will surely not deal only with\r\narmed conflicts. We must be prepared to face other\r\nkinds of war: social war against poverty; judicial war\r\nagainst organized crime; political war against\r\ninterventionism in our sovereign economies; and moral\r\nwar against the violation of human rights.\r\nWe cannot yet assert that the process of\r\nglobalization really represents progress for all of\r\nhumankind. While globalization has generated great\r\neconomic and technological advances, such progress\r\ncontinues to be the privilege of the industrialized\r\nnations and very small segments of the population of\r\nthe rest of the world. True progress for humanity\r\ncannot be brought by phenomena which generate new\r\nand more profound imbalances in the quality of life for\r\nindividuals. We must work hard to ensure that States\r\nand multilateral organizations such as the United\r\nNations, direct their efforts to guaranteeing that the\r\nbenefits of globalization do not remain in the hands of\r\na few.\r\nTherefore, any reform of the United Nations must\r\nbegin with the return of the concept of solidarity which\r\ninspired the San Francisco agreements, and which is the\r\nvery raison d’etre of our Movement. We want not more\r\nsummits, but more compliance with the summits not yet\r\ncomplied with; a summit on compliance with other\r\nsummits would be welcome.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) is not being properly complied with.\r\nImportant members have yet to ratify the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention. There seems to be no interest in\r\nmaking progress on fundamental agreements to restrict\r\nthe conventional arms markets run by the world’s\r\nmerchants of war. Government aid, as a proportion of\r\nthe resources transferred to developing countries by\r\ndeveloped nations, has dropped from 42 per cent to 24\r\nper cent in recent years. Funds for military operations\r\nwithin the United Nations system have increased 17\r\ntimes compared with increases in funds for social\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe must find new paths for the United Nations to\r\nfollow. The reform of the United Nations system\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General must encompass all\r\nspheres of the United Nations system as a whole.\r\nIn the first place, there is the economic sphere.\r\nThe Bretton Woods organizations — the World Bank\r\nand the International Monetary Fund — which were\r\nborn as part of the agreement of March 1946, have\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nprogressively been removing themselves from the original\r\ndirection exercised by this Assembly over their economic\r\nand social policies. They have ended up by configuring a\r\ndevelopment model which they impose on developing\r\neconomies, without those economies being able to discuss\r\ntheir own priorities. Reform should include matters such\r\nas having greater international liquidity, greater flexibility\r\nin the management of multilateral debt, concessionary\r\ncredit flows for social investment and coordination with\r\neconomic bodies representing the interests of developing\r\ncountries, such as the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD), the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO).\r\nThe situation of the United Nations social sphere is\r\nthe most worrisome. The greatest burden of the\r\nOrganization’s budgetary crisis has fallen upon the bodies\r\ninvolved, whose financing has dropped by many millions\r\nof dollars during the present decade. Some developed\r\ncountries have inexplicably withdrawn from bodies\r\ndevoted to children, culture, population, employment and\r\nthe environment, such as the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), the International Labour Organization\r\n(ILO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Food\r\nProgramme (WFP) and the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral contains interesting proposals to restore the\r\nactivities of such bodies, which constitute the very heart\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn a world where 1.3 billion people still survive on\r\nless than a dollar a day, in a world where, for the price\r\nof one combat plane, 57,000 children in Africa can be\r\nfed for a year, it is impossible to conceive of a reform of\r\nthe United Nations whose priority is not to strengthen the\r\nwork of its institutions and programmes dedicated to\r\nsocial issues.\r\nFinally, there is the matter of the political\r\nrelationship between the Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. The proposed strengthening of the Security\r\nCouncil cannot be carried out at the expense of taking\r\npower away from this Assembly, the highest democratic\r\nbody of the system. Any expansion of the Council must\r\ntake into account that developing countries by their\r\nnature and as spokesmen for various regions of the\r\nworld, need to have greater representation. The\r\ninstrument of the veto should be abolished because it is\r\nanti-democratic, since it places in the hands of one\r\ncountry the power to ignore the will of the majority. If\r\nthe veto cannot be eliminated, it should be restricted to\r\nthose matters truly fundamental for world security, and\r\nthe right to appeal vetoes before judicial or political\r\nbodies, such as this Assembly, should be established.\r\nA few months ago the Secretary-General presented\r\nto the United Nations a very interesting proposal for the\r\nreform for the Organization. The Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, which I represent, is reviewing this\r\ninitiative and considers that a number of its proposals\r\nwould contribute to the revitalization of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe do not want a United Nations divided between\r\nrich and poor, with Members having first- and second-\r\nclass status according to their economic contributions.\r\nThe United Nations is not a private company, but the\r\nforum of solidarity in which all the countries of the\r\nworld come together.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the\r\nUnited Nations, and the international community at\r\nlarge, to confront the grave problem of arms\r\nproliferation with a clear and well-defined strategy that\r\nwill lead us to concrete results. To that end, I wish to\r\npropose five points for effectively dealing with of this\r\nmatter.\r\nFirst, I propose the declaration by the developing\r\ncountries of a two-year, worldwide moratorium on the\r\nhigh-technology-weapons trade.\r\nSecondly, I propose the expansion of the United\r\nNations Register of Conventional Arms to include light\r\nweapons, as well as production and storage, with a\r\nview to strengthening its role as a means of promoting\r\nconfidence.\r\nThirdly, I propose that the Governments of arms-\r\nproducing countries commit themselves to the\r\nestablishment of a moratorium on the sale of high-\r\ntechnology weapons in regions in conflict, as well as to\r\nconverting their weapons-production industrial capacity\r\nand workforce to other economic sectors.\r\nFourthly, I propose the follow-up and verification\r\nof all multilateral commitments and existing treaties in\r\nthis area.\r\nFifthly, I propose that the regulation of trade in\r\nlight arms, as well as in high-technology weaponry,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nshould be a subject of deliberations at the fourth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\r\nThis initiative is designed to deal with the various\r\nfacets of the grave phenomenon of arms proliferation,\r\nwhich — besides draining vast resources that could be\r\ndevoted to the social and economic development of our\r\npeoples — constitutes the most dangerous threat to the\r\npeace and security of the world.\r\nMuch water has flowed under the bridge that we\r\nbuilt in San Francisco half a century ago to make the\r\nworld a better place to live.\r\nWe have, without any doubt, progressed, but we\r\ncannot claim to be satisfied despite what we have\r\nachieved. So long as there is a sad, hungry child in the\r\nworld, there will be a United Nations. So long as there is\r\na weapon raised to kill a neighbour, there will be a\r\nUnited Nations. So long as entire populations are\r\ndisplaced from their homes by violence, hunger and\r\nintolerance, there will be a United Nations. So long as\r\nthousands of young people do not have access to\r\neducation because they must struggle every day to\r\nsurvive, there will be a United Nations. So long as the\r\nwhims of the powerful continue to defy the aspirations of\r\nthe powerless, there will be a United Nations. So long as\r\ndrugs on the streets threaten the future of our children,\r\nthere will be a United Nations. So long as terrorists and\r\nviolators of human rights continue to run loose, there will\r\nbe a United Nations. So long as there is a need for\r\nsolidarity, love and joy in the world, there will be a\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nColombia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Vice-Chancellor\r\nand Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Wolfgang Schüssel.\r\nMr. Schüssel (Austria): Let me express my\r\npleasure at seeing you, Sir, the Foreign Minister of\r\nUkraine — with which Austria has close historical links\r\nand enjoys excellent relations — presiding over the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your profound\r\nprofessional experience in the United Nations system\r\nand your negotiating skills will ensure substantial\r\nprogress in our ambitious agenda.\r\nOn behalf of the Federal Government of Austria, I\r\nshould also like to express our sincere appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, whose wise leadership\r\nof the Organization we fully support. In the short time\r\nsince he took office he has succeeded in reaching out\r\nnot only to Governments but also to the people and the\r\nmedia, thus fostering a new awareness about the goals,\r\naspirations and achievements of the United Nations as\r\nthe indispensable instrument of global cooperation.\r\nMy colleague from Luxembourg has already\r\nexpressed the position of the European Union, which\r\nwe fully endorse. I should like to elaborate on a few\r\npoints to which Austria attaches particular importance.\r\nThe United Nations is currently preparing itself for\r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. The\r\nSecretary-General and his team, with the\r\nencouragement of Member States, have initiated\r\ncomprehensive reform. Austria welcomes this major\r\neffort to redirect the Organization towards the needs of\r\nthe future, and we fully endorse the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nproposals. In particular I should like to emphasize the\r\nfollowing points: first, the streamlining of leadership\r\nand management structure; secondly, the consolidation\r\nof the United Nations presence in the field; thirdly, the\r\nreturn of development to the centre of United Nations\r\nactivities and the better combining of the potential of\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes; and, fourthly,\r\nthe strengthening of human rights in all aspects of the\r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nWithout adequate resources, however, the United\r\nNations will not succeed in carrying out its tasks. As\r\nlong as Member States do not fully honour their\r\nobligations, the financial situation of the Organization\r\nwill remain critical. Settling the arrears is therefore an\r\nimperative. Austria is proud of its traditional record of\r\npaying its contributions to the United Nations in full and\r\non time. The serious political will and sincere\r\ncommitment of every Government will be required.\r\nNeedless to say, unilateral decisions are unacceptable in\r\nthe framework of multilateral cooperation.\r\nThe fight against drugs, crime and terrorism has\r\nrightly become a first priority for the international\r\ncommunity. Nearly 1 per cent of the world\u0027s population\r\nabove the age of 15 today has abused stimulants. An\r\nestimated 300 tons of heroin a year have been produced\r\nduring this decade to supply about 8 million addicts.\r\nWhile I hope that regional cooperation will soon\r\ncontribute effectively to the fight against illegal\r\ntrafficking and drug abuse, the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nintention to strengthen the United Nations capacities in\r\nthis field deserves the support of all Member States.\r\nAustria will cooperate closely with the newly\r\nappointed Director-General of the United Nations Office\r\nat Vienna, Mr. Pino Arlacchi. We are convinced that his\r\nprofound knowledge and experience in fighting organized\r\ncrime will be a strong asset in pooling the resources of\r\nthe United Nations system, the Member States and\r\nrelevant institutions. To demonstrate its support, Austria\r\nwill make a significant financial contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\r\nTrust Fund.\r\nIllegal migration is increasingly linked to\r\ntransnational crime. The reckless exploitation of humans\r\nin distress is a particularly reprehensible form of\r\ninternational crime. An increasing number of people\r\nsmuggled illegally across borders find themselves\r\nhelpless victims deprived of all financial means and with\r\nan illegal status in a foreign country. The perpetrators, at\r\nthe same time, earn the profits and escape justice by\r\ncynically making use of a loophole in the international\r\ncriminal law regime. There is an urgent need for an\r\ninternational legal instrument making the smuggling of\r\nillegal migrants punishable as a transnational crime, thus\r\nensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice.\r\nI have asked legal experts to prepare a draft\r\ninternational convention against the smuggling of illegal\r\nmigrants. This draft is being circulated as an official\r\ndocument under the appropriate agenda item. We\r\npropose that the United Nations Commission on Crime\r\nPrevention and Criminal Justice consider this draft as a\r\nmatter of priority at its next session. I am confident that\r\nour initiative will help in closing a dangerous legal\r\nlacuna, thereby strengthening international judicial\r\ncooperation in this field.\r\nSubstance abuse and drug-related crimes continue\r\nto take a high toll in both the developing and the\r\nindustrialized worlds. Human and social development is\r\nthreatened on a global scale. Strengthening and\r\nupdating existing international anti-drug capacities will\r\nrequire innovation and new methods. In this respect, the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to\r\ninternational drug control, which is to be held in June\r\n1998, will provide us with an excellent opportunity to\r\nrenew our political commitment by closing our ranks\r\nagainst illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for\r\nprogress in preventive efforts.\r\nAnti-personnel landmines constitute a particularly\r\nmalicious threat to the security of individuals and\r\ncountries. Even decades after the end of a conflict, such\r\nas the Second World War, these hidden killers take a\r\nterrible toll among civilian populations, killing or\r\nmaiming more than 20,000 people each and every year.\r\nEvery year 20 times more mines are laid than cleared.\r\nEstimates speak of 110 million mines laid in more than\r\n60 countries. I think that this spiral of death must be\r\nstopped.\r\nAustria was one of the first countries to ban anti-\r\npersonnel landmines at the national level. We strongly\r\nadvocated a total ban, and we prepared the draft for\r\nsuch a convention. Non-governmental organizations\r\nhave played a prominent role in creating the necessary\r\nmomentum, and I would like to thank them respectfully\r\nfor that on behalf of the Austrian Government. The\r\nOslo Diplomatic Conference negotiated a treaty on this\r\nbasis, and I look forward to signing the Convention in\r\nOttawa, together with so many of my colleagues who\r\nshare this goal. I urge the countries that were not able\r\nto join the consensus in Oslo to become part of the\r\nprocess as soon as possible.\r\nTed Turner has generously earmarked a part of his\r\nunprecedented $1 billion donation to support intensified\r\ndemining efforts. I wish to thank him for this unique\r\ngesture.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nThe dignity and worth of the human person are\r\nuniversal. Consequently, it is the duty of our universal\r\nOrganization to help implement governmental\r\ncommitments in this field. Since the Vienna World\r\nConference on Human Rights, human rights have moved\r\ninto the centre of United Nations programmes and\r\nactivities. Austria welcomes this trend. There is an\r\nintrinsic relationship between respect for human rights,\r\ndemocracy and sustainable development. Guaranteeing\r\nhuman rights is an essential precondition for lasting\r\nsecurity and stability. This link has been highlighted by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his commendable report on the\r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nI take this opportunity to warmly welcome the\r\nappointment of President Mary Robinson as High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and to pledge Austria\u0027s\r\nfull support for her work. Her outstanding personality\r\nwill undoubtedly contribute to further strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations role in human rights.\r\nThe review of the Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action and the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights make 1998 the\r\nyear of human rights. This will provide us with a unique\r\nopportunity to shape the international human rights\r\nprogramme for the new millennium. Its central objective\r\nmust remain that international human rights standards be\r\nrespected at the level of each nation. For this, the role of\r\nGovernments is crucial; so is that of civil society. The\r\ninternational community, therefore, not only has to ensure\r\ncompliance with these commitments and provide the\r\nnecessary assistance, but it must also promote the role of\r\ncivil society. We see this year of human rights as an\r\noccasion for reaching out to human rights defenders in all\r\ncorners of the world. As host country of the World\r\nConference and as the country assuming the presidency\r\nof the European Union in the second half of 1998,\r\nAustria offers its cooperation to ensure a successful\r\nhuman rights year 1998 in all parts of the world.\r\nAustria places great emphasis on the promotion and\r\nprotection of minorities. We do so on the basis of our\r\nhistorical experience and owing to our conviction that\r\nethnic minorities do not threaten but rather enrich our\r\nsocieties. In this context, I am pleased to refer to the\r\nsuccessful solution of an important minority issue. The\r\nAustrian minority in South Tyrol today enjoys a well-\r\nbalanced autonomy on the basis of the Paris Treaty of\r\n1946 between Austria and Italy. This autonomy has\r\ngenerated considerable interest in other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nWith regard to the human rights year, the\r\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform continues to be\r\na priority. In particular, Austria supports efforts to\r\nstrengthen the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women. We also are\r\ncontributing to the enhanced practical implementation\r\nof other international human rights treaties, such as the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, in particular\r\nwith regard to juvenile justice.\r\nEmployment, as a matter of growing global\r\nconcern, rightly ranks high on the political agenda.\r\nGovernments are urged to develop further instruments\r\nto fight unemployment through the effective monitoring\r\nof labour policies. The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen provided a set of\r\nprinciples and goals in this respect. In order to confirm\r\nthese commitments and to identify good practices, I\r\nshould like to recall that Austria, as a follow-up to\r\nCopenhagen, will host an international expert meeting\r\non employment in early February 1998.\r\nIn our joint efforts to promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the peaceful use of outer space for the\r\nbenefit of all countries has become an issue of rapidly\r\ngrowing importance to the United Nations in the last\r\nfew years. I should like to reaffirm the full support of\r\nmy country for the United Nations aim to expand\r\nactivities in this field. We welcome the holding of the\r\nthird United Nations Conference on the Exploration and\r\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space, which will be convened\r\nas a special session of the Committee on the Peaceful\r\nUses of Outer Space, open to all Member States, in\r\nVienna in July 1999.\r\nMy country is deeply committed to the peace\r\nprocess in the former Yugoslavia, in particular in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The Dayton accords provide\r\nthe framework for the return of Bosnia to normalcy and\r\nstability, for its economic recovery and for\r\nreconciliation among its ethnic groups. Full and\r\ncomprehensive implementation of the Dayton\r\nAgreement is therefore imperative. This includes\r\nbringing to justice all indicted war criminals, wherever\r\nthey may be. If we want to safeguard the Dayton\r\nprocess, the international community must remain\r\nfirmly committed to taking the necessary political,\r\neconomic and military measures even beyond July\r\n1998. International support must remain conditional on\r\nfull compliance with all international obligations. I\r\nshould like to pay a special tribute to the United\r\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, which has made\r\nan invaluable contribution to fostering peace in that\r\nregion.\r\nAustria is in favour of integrating the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia fully into the United Nations\r\nfamily as soon as the necessary preconditions, including\r\nthe application for membership, are fulfilled. In this\r\nrespect, I stress our expectation that Belgrade will grant a\r\nlarge degree of autonomy to Kosovo and the Albanian\r\nminority.\r\nAustria has followed the situation in the Middle East\r\nwith great concern. We regret the fact that the peace\r\nprocess has come to a near-standstill. The confidence\r\nbuilt up by the Oslo process has been largely destroyed.\r\nOur main task must be to re-establish and to strengthen\r\nthis confidence step by step and to bring the parties back\r\nto the negotiating table. The present situation increases\r\nthe risk of extremist activity. A precondition for progress\r\nin the peace process will certainly be respect by all\r\nparties for the agreements concluded and the\r\nengagements undertaken.\r\nAustria is seriously preoccupied by the precarious\r\neconomic and social situation in the Palestinian\r\nterritories, where the unemployment rate is 70 per cent. It\r\nis of paramount importance to create the necessary\r\neconomic conditions as a basis for political stability.\r\nThere will be no lasting peace without a credible\r\nresponse to the economic needs of the people in the\r\nregion.\r\nSince 1960, Austria has participated very actively in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. Considering the\r\ngrowing importance in contemporary peacekeeping of\r\nregional arrangements under Chapter VIII of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, my country has started to\r\ncooperate closely with those States and organizations that\r\nhave taken leading roles in this field. In 1997 Austria\r\nprovided about 1,200 troops, military observers and\r\ncivilian police to 11 different peacekeeping operations\r\nthroughout the world, including the Stabilization Force\r\n(SFOR) and the operation in Albania.\r\nAustria actively supports the standby arrangement\r\nsystem, created in 1994, and in this connection took part\r\nin establishing the United Nations Stand-by Forces High-\r\nReadiness Brigade in December 1996, which was created\r\nto build a capacity for quick preventive action and crisis\r\nresponse.\r\nI am deeply convinced that, especially in times of\r\nscarce financial resources, the international community\r\nshould make a greater investment in the field of conflict\r\nprevention and preventive diplomacy. The United\r\nNations has the mandate to take a leading role in\r\nfurther developing instruments for preventive\r\ndiplomacy.\r\nAustria is, and will continue to be, a loyal\r\nMember and a strong supporter of the world\r\nOrganization. The United Nations — our\r\nOrganization — is the only global instrument that can\r\nprovide the necessary response to existing global\r\nchallenges: eradicating poverty; protecting our planet\u0027s\r\nenvironment; combating drugs, organized crime and\r\nterrorism; and promoting human rights, including the\r\nrights of children. To this end we have to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco.\r\nMr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdellatif Filali, and inviting him\r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Filali (Morocco) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nFirst of all, let me say how very pleased I am to\r\ncongratulate you sincerely, Sir, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, on your\r\nelection to preside over the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly — an election that is a token of\r\nconsideration for your political experience and great\r\ncompetence.\r\nIt is also a pleasure for me to salute you, Sir, as\r\nthe representative of the friendly country of Ukraine,\r\nwhich has solid ties of friendship and full cooperation\r\nwith the Kingdom of Morocco. I am convinced that\r\nyour vast experience and excellent command of\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\ninternational affairs will guarantee the success of our\r\ndebates and will lead our session to results that open up\r\nnew prospects of peace, cooperation and prosperity.\r\nMr. Campbell (Ireland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to express to\r\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Razali Ismail, the\r\nrepresentative of the friendly country of Malaysia, our\r\nrespect and gratitude for his efforts and for having\r\nsuccessfully guided the work of our previous session.\r\nI should also like to extend to the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, my most\r\nsincere congratulations on the confidence placed in him\r\nby virtue of his election as Secretary-General, which\r\ncrowns many years of competent management and\r\ntireless effort within the context of the United Nations.\r\nHis election also reaffirms the deep consideration in\r\nwhich the friendly country of Ghana is held.\r\nSince our last session, the world has been\r\nexperiencing a period of various political and economic\r\ninteraction which, unfortunately, has not lived up to\r\nmankind\u0027s aspirations for bringing the international\r\ncommunity closer to tranquillity, security and peace.\r\nInternational relations indeed continue to be fraught with\r\nvarious tensions and disturbances. Thus, on the\r\ninternational scene, new conflicts have emerged which\r\nthreaten the security, stability and sovereignty of peoples.\r\nGiven these challenges, we believe that those\r\nproblems which emerge in the international arena today\r\ncan be resolved only through international efforts under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. In this context, we\r\napplaud the efforts made by the Secretary-General to\r\nreform and restructure the United Nations and improve its\r\nworking methods in accordance with the requirements of\r\nthis age. In the same way, we reaffirm our support for all\r\nof these efforts aimed at strengthening our Organization\r\nand enhancing its effectiveness to allow it to carry out its\r\nmission in full, in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe firmly believe that the aims of any reform\r\ndesigned to restructure the Organization and rationalize\r\nits expenditures can be attained only if due account is\r\ntaken of the interests of the developing countries and,\r\nabove all, if reform provides for a solution to their\r\neconomic and social problems as well as the provision of\r\nmaterial and technical means required for these ends.\r\nWith regard to enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil, we would like to stress the need for consensus\r\nand the achievement of balanced and equitable\r\nrepresentation of all continents, in particular since the\r\nconditions in which United Nations bodies, including\r\nthe Security Council, were established have now\r\ndisappeared. The world is now witnessing profound and\r\nswift changes which force us to reconsider the\r\ncomposition and role of the Security Council to make it\r\na genuinely effective instrument which is not subject to\r\nobjectives and interests which contravene the Charter.\r\nThe international community welcomed with\r\noptimism the peace process which began in the Middle\r\nEast on the basis of agreements reached between the\r\nparties concerned. However, the interruption of this\r\npeace process, as a result of the violation by the\r\nGovernment of Israel of all previous commitments and\r\nthe contravention of all obligations and rules of\r\ninternational conduct now threaten to wipe out all\r\nprevious efforts to strengthen the foundations for peace\r\nin the region.\r\nThe violation by the Government of Israel of its\r\ncommitments was illustrated by its decision to resume\r\nits settlement policy and to alter the cultural\r\ncharacteristics and demographic composition of East\r\nJerusalem. This decision is in violation of previous\r\nagreements with the Palestinian side. This unilateral and\r\nillegitimate decision is also a blatant violation of the\r\nFourth Geneva Convention, which forbids occupation\r\nauthorities from effecting any changes in the territories\r\nunder their control.\r\nIsrael, which is still persisting in its refusal to\r\nimplement Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973) and 425 (1978), has once again brought about\r\nan escalation of tension in southern Lebanon, and is\r\ncontinuing to ignore the Syrian proposals to resume\r\nnegotiations from the point at which they were broken\r\noff.\r\nOur vision emanates from our conviction that\r\npeace in the region cannot endure or achieve its goals\r\nexcept through equitable treatment which guarantees the\r\nmutual interests of all parties and in the context of a\r\nregion free from weapons of mass destruction.\r\nConvinced as we are of the need to pursue peace\r\nefforts, and conduct this process in accordance with the\r\nlegal framework laid down for it, we would like to\r\nstress the need to honour all the obligations stipulated\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nin the agreements signed, and the adherence to credibility\r\nin dealings based on such agreements, which will lead to\r\npeace and security for all the peoples of the region, and\r\nallow the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination and establish their independent State with\r\nAl-Quds as its capital.\r\nIn this framework, the international community\r\nshould take the necessary measures to make Israel respect\r\nand implement Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe stability of the Middle East requires the\r\nestablishment and consolidation of security in the Gulf\r\nregion. We deplore the sufferings of the Iraqi people,\r\nwho are living in extremely harsh conditions as a result\r\nof the economic embargo which has been imposed on\r\nthem for many years now, and we reaffirm that the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995)\r\non “oil for food” is a first step towards lifting the\r\nembargo imposed on the Iraqi people. We look forward\r\nto the day in the near future which will mark the end of\r\nthat suffering and the return of Iraq to the exercise of its\r\nrights as a member of the Arab family of nations and an\r\nactive and constructive member of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMorocco, as a part of the Arab Maghreb region,\r\ntakes a special interest in the existing dispute between the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and certain western countries\r\nbecause of its negative impact on the regional situation\r\nand on the brotherly Libyan people.\r\nThus, we call for a favourable response to the\r\ninitiatives undertaken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and\r\nthe flexibility it has demonstrated, and the efforts exerted\r\nby the Arab Maghreb Union, the League of Arab States,\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement with a view to lifting the sanctions\r\nimposed on Libya.\r\nMorocco, which has closely followed the\r\ndevelopment of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand has contributed, along with other members of the\r\ninternational community, to the initiatives proposed by\r\nthe chair of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\r\nand through participation of Moroccan military units in\r\nthe Implementation Force and Stabilization Force,\r\nexpresses its satisfaction at the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the military and civilian aspects of the\r\nDayton Accord, and stresses the need to pursue efforts to\r\nensure its full implementation with a view to establishing\r\nthe legitimate rights of the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and to contribute to the reconstruction of\r\nthe country through provision of the requisite means as\r\nagreed by the conferences of donor countries.\r\nAs an African nation, and given its age-old and\r\nvaried relations with other African countries, and\r\nfurthermore conscious of its obligations to Africa,\r\nMorocco expresses deep concern about the deterioration\r\nof the political, economic and social conditions in many\r\nparts of that continent.\r\nMorocco follows with deep concern the\r\npersistence of instability in some parts of Africa, and\r\nreaffirms its determination to support and enhance the\r\nefforts of the international community to find\r\nappropriate and lasting solutions to crises.\r\nOn the other hand, the woeful economic situation\r\nin Africa is a source of concern for the international\r\ncommunity. This situation is particularly reflected in the\r\nweak participation of the continent in world trade and\r\nin an increase in its debt burden. It is also reflected in a\r\nchronically inadequate infrastructure, a serious\r\ndeterioration in social and health conditions, and,\r\ndespite the stringent structural reforms introduced by\r\nAfrican countries, by the paucity of foreign investment.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the initiative taken by\r\nPortugal to convene a European-African summit\r\nmeeting to consider these conditions in the continent\r\nand to seek appropriate solutions. We consider that this\r\ninitiative reflects the awareness of the European Union\r\nin respect of its responsibilities with regard to Africa.\r\nMorocco therefore proposes the convening of a\r\nministerial meeting to prepare for that summit.\r\nSimilarly, the Security Council\u0027s initiative calling for\r\nthe convening of a special meeting at the foreign\r\nministerial level to consider the situation in Africa\r\nattests to the degree of concern of the international\r\ncommunity with regard to the gravity of that situation.\r\nIn its relations with all other African countries,\r\nMorocco has always adopted policies aimed at effective\r\ncooperation, taking into consideration the priorities and\r\nthe basic needs of our partners.\r\nAs a consequence of the profound changes that\r\naffected the world economy after the Second World\r\nWar, it has become current knowledge that the world is\r\ntoday characterized primarily by the globalization of the\r\neconomy. However, the new challenge which faces the\r\ninternational community today lies in coping with\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\neconomic and social development issues in all their\r\ndimensions, and doing so in harmony with our efforts to\r\nachieve peace and security.\r\nThe liberalization of world markets and the\r\nglobalization and comprehensiveness of the world\r\neconomy have led to a noticeable increase in the volume\r\nof trade and financial flows. However, this has not eased\r\nthe marginalization of developing countries or reduced\r\ntheir debt burden.\r\nMorocco, which has been following with interest the\r\nactivities of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nconsiders that liberalization of trade must be basically\r\naimed at correcting existing discrepancies and at\r\nnarrowing the gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nWe hope that the second WTO conference, due to\r\ntake place in Geneva, will provide a new opportunity for\r\nthe international community which leads to consolidating\r\nthe bases and rules governing multilateral relations, and\r\nto taking decisions likely to reconcile the imperative for\r\ntrade liberalization and the requirements of development,\r\nwhile responding to the aspirations of developing\r\ncountries by allowing them, if necessary, to adopt\r\nprotectionist trade measures.\r\nWith regard to the question of the Sahara, Morocco,\r\nwhich cooperated with Mr. James Baker as soon as he\r\nwas appointed Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General\r\nfor Western Sahara, hopes that the results achieved will\r\nallow for the implementation of the United Nations\r\nsettlement plan. In this regard, Morocco, which took the\r\ninitiative of proposing a referendum in 1981, stresses\r\nonce more its readiness and desire to cooperate with the\r\nUnited Nations for the achievement of this objective.\r\nThe most important achievement of the international\r\ncommunity in this century, to which we soon bid\r\nfarewell, was the end of colonialism in almost all regions\r\nof the world. In the past few months, the world has\r\nwitnessed the return of Hong Kong to its parent country,\r\nthe People\u0027s Republic of China, and Macao will also be\r\nso returned in 1999. In the light of the example of Hong\r\nKong and the plans for the future of Macao, logic now\r\ndictates the elimination of all remaining pockets of\r\ncolonialism throughout the world.\r\nHere I am referring in particular to the Moroccan\r\ncities of Sebta and Melilla and the islands adjacent to\r\nthem, which remain under Spanish domination. Morocco\r\nhas always believed in the virtues of dialogue as a\r\ncivilized way of reaching a final settlement to the\r\nproblem of Sebta and Melilla so as to enable Morocco\r\nto regain its sovereignty over those territories while\r\nguaranteeing Spain\u0027s interests. It was in this context that\r\nHis Majesty King Hassan II took the initiative in\r\ncalling for the setting up of a Moroccan-Spanish unit to\r\nconsider a final solution to this question. This initiative\r\nimplies a greater rapprochement between the two\r\ncountries, whose impact would spread to wider and\r\nmore comprehensive fields.\r\nHumankind is still committed to the noble\r\npurposes laid down in the Charter of our Organization.\r\nIt is therefore incumbent upon us to pursue efforts\r\naiming at the furtherance of those purposes so that,\r\ntogether, in a spirit of confidence and renewed hope,\r\nwe may bring about a better future for all of\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Abdellatif Filali, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Clement Rohee, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. Rohee (Guyana): For some time now the\r\nUnited Nations has been engaged in a process of reform\r\nand restructuring with the aim of improving its capacity\r\nto address the many challenges which the world now\r\nfaces. It has been an arduous and time-consuming\r\nexercise which, if truth be told, has diverted us, to\r\nsome degree, from our primary task of promoting\r\nglobal peace and development. Yet the exercise is a\r\nnecessary one if we are in fact to enhance the\r\nOrganization\u0027s efficiency and effectiveness and to gear\r\nit for service to the international community in the\r\ncoming years.\r\nMy delegation is confident that, under the able\r\nleadership of the President, we will be able to make\r\nprogress in our endeavours. His wide diplomatic\r\nexperience, together with his intimate knowledge of the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nOrganization, will serve, I am sure, to orient and\r\naccelerate our efforts. We congratulate him on his\r\nunanimous election and vouchsafe to him our ready\r\ncooperation to make this fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly a significant turning point in the life\r\nof the Organization.\r\nTo the President\u0027s distinguished predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, we convey our\r\ndeep and sincere appreciation for the determination and\r\ndynamism which he brought to bear on the work of the\r\nlast session. To his great credit, he laboured tirelessly to\r\nfind general agreement on the steps which must be taken\r\nto revitalize the United Nations. His exemplary leadership\r\nwill no doubt inspire us to fulfil the task at hand without\r\nundue delay.\r\nI also wish to acknowledge with appreciation the\r\nnotable contribution which our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, has made to the reform process since\r\ntaking office. In keeping with the promise made to the\r\nAssembly, he has presented us with a set of interesting\r\nproposals for the reshaping of the Organization for\r\nservice in the twenty-first century. This comprehensive\r\nand constructive document requires our serious\r\nconsideration. I intend, therefore, in the time allocated to\r\nme, to make a few comments which I trust, despite their\r\nbrief and preliminary nature, will provide an indication of\r\nour thinking at the present time on the ways and means\r\nby which the Organization can be reformed.\r\nLet me first say that we share the vision which the\r\nSecretary-General has set forth for the future role of the\r\nUnited Nations. The Organization has proved its capacity\r\nfor preventing major wars and forging international\r\nconsensus on important aspects of international relations.\r\nIt is now poised to explore the many possibilities of\r\nmultilateralism. Increasingly, Member States, large and\r\nsmall, are seeing it in their interest to cooperate with the\r\nUnited Nations to maximize their ability to deal with\r\nseveral international concerns. There is increasing\r\nrecourse to its machinery in order to deal with such\r\nissues as development, the environment, disease, drug\r\ntrafficking and terrorism, to name just a few. Many of\r\nthe special agencies, such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nChildren\u0027s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and others\r\ntoo numerous to mention, cater to the needs of the most\r\nvulnerable sections of our population — the aged,\r\nwomen, children and our indigenous peoples.\r\nBuilt on the pillars of multilateralism, the United\r\nNations offers Member States a unique forum in which\r\nthey can come together for their common good. Its\r\ngrand design, elaborated some 50 years ago, remains by\r\nand large a useful chart for promoting international\r\ncomity. It is important, therefore, as we plan for a new\r\nera, that we hold fast to the founders\u0027 abiding vision\r\nlest we be dashed against the rocks of isolation and left\r\nto survive as best we can.\r\nThe effective translation of this vision into reality\r\nrequires strong and dynamic leadership. History has\r\nshown that, much too often, our most worthwhile\r\naspirations have been left unfulfilled because of\r\ninadequate political commitment and direction. States\r\noften see the world only through the prism of narrow\r\nself-interest and are blind to the virtues of concerted\r\naction. However, the challenges of our times, when no\r\nsingle nation, however rich and powerful, can hope to\r\nbe entirely self-reliant, require the highest level of\r\ninternational cooperation. For it is only by unity of\r\npurpose that we, the United Nations, can hope to\r\nachieve the aspirations so loftily declared in the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Secretary-General,\r\nas the Organization\u0027s chief administrative officer, has\r\ndemonstrated vision and leadership in outlining his\r\nsuggestions for reform. Of particular satisfaction to us\r\nis the fact that in setting his priorities for the\r\nOrganization\u0027s future work he has accorded high\r\nimportance to its development activities. At a time\r\nwhen financial support is weak, it is imperative that\r\nappropriate strategies be developed to eradicate world\r\npoverty and restore economic and social prosperity,\r\nparticularly in small developing countries.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nintention to strengthen management capability within\r\nthe Secretariat to provide for full coordination of effort\r\nand for forward planning. We recognize the need for\r\neconomy, but hope that this will not be to the detriment\r\nof clear mandates of Member States and to the\r\nfundamental nature of the Organization. It would be a\r\ngrave pity if, in reducing costs, the United Nations were\r\nto be starved of substance.\r\nWe certainly approve of the idea initially\r\npropounded by the Government of Japan, and\r\nsubsequently endorsed by the G-7 countries, calling for\r\nadministrative savings to be channelled into\r\ndevelopment activities. This dividend, although\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\npresumably limited in quantity, may be significant\r\nenough to serve as a catalyst for financing the\r\ndevelopment account that the Secretary-General proposes.\r\nLike the rest of the world, we welcome the generous gift\r\nof the Chairman of Turner Communications, who had\r\nparticipated in the 1994 World Hearings on Development\r\nand has now seen fit to come out in support of this\r\ncause. One can only hope that such philanthropy will be\r\nemulated by others in the private sector.\r\nThe recently concluded Agenda for Development,\r\ntogether with the joint strategy for development of the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD) and the Development Assistance Committee\r\n(DAC), provides a basis for moving forward in the field\r\nof economic and social cooperation. Both documents\r\naccept the fact that while private investment flows have\r\nan important role to play in development, they are,\r\nbecause of their high selectivity and general\r\nunpredictability, insufficient to guarantee the development\r\nof small disadvantaged countries. For those countries —\r\nand here I include my own — development assistance,\r\ndebt relief, capacity building and increased trade will\r\nremain crucial to our progress.\r\nAt the macroeconomic level, we will continue to\r\nlook to the United Nations to play a more central role in\r\nthe concertation of development policies. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said,\r\n“The promotion of economic and social\r\nprogress is one of the United Nations primary\r\nobjectives, enshrined in the Charter.” (A/51/950,\r\npara. 68)\r\nIt cannot, consequently, be marginalized in the\r\ndevelopment process. Instead, it must be its principal\r\ngenerator.\r\nAccordingly, both its structure and operation must\r\nbe such as to provide “a more integrated collaborative\r\napproach”. (ibid., para. 72) Greater coordination of\r\ndevelopment activities, both at Headquarters and at the\r\nregional and local levels, is essential. As has been\r\nsuggested, the creation of a new development group and\r\na United Nations development-assistance framework\r\ncould possibly provide the necessary focus and direction.\r\nWe should be careful to ensure, however, that the\r\nstrengths of individual actors and agencies are not lost in\r\nany merger.\r\nWe fully support the proposal for a closer and\r\nmore cooperative relationship with the World Bank and\r\nother international financial institutions. Over time,\r\nthose bodies, although connected with the United\r\nNations, have moved away from their original mandates\r\nand developed quite independently of the Organization.\r\nIt is time that those bodies concentrate on human\r\ndevelopment as distinct from the means of\r\ndevelopment. We should therefore seek to bring them\r\ninto line with the main organs of the United Nations.\r\nTo that end, we encourage the Secretary-General to\r\ntake whatever steps are needed to achieve that\r\nharmonization of the development efforts. We will also\r\nhave to consider at some stage how to strengthen the\r\nrelationship of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, we must complement these\r\nefforts by giving to the Assembly and the Economic\r\nand Social Council the direct and overarching\r\nresponsibility for leading the development enterprise. In\r\nthe past, those organs have been sadly left behind in the\r\ndevelopment process. Although useful as forums for\r\ndialogue and consensus building, they have failed to\r\nengage the key players. We should therefore strive to\r\ntransform them so that they can provide a stronger\r\npolitical impetus for development and ensure effective\r\nglobal macroeconomic management.\r\nWe hope that from this debate will come a clear\r\nindication of proposals and recommendations that are\r\nconsidered desirable and feasible. There will be some,\r\nof course, which, like the conversion of the Trusteeship\r\nCouncil into a forum for dealing with issues such as the\r\nglobal commons, will require further study. These\r\nproposals may be explored in informal working sessions\r\nof the Assembly and then taken up formally as a\r\npackage for approval and subsequent implementation.\r\nWith diligent cooperation on the part of all, there is no\r\nreason why such reforms cannot be agreed upon early\r\nin the new year.\r\nInstitutional tinkering alone, however, will not\r\nguarantee development. The most important dynamic\r\nremains the political will of States. The several\r\nstrategies that we have forged and the many\r\ndeclarations we have issued over the years remain\r\nlargely unfulfilled. It is no wonder that poverty is today\r\nthe single most important threat to global peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nThe reduction and eventual elimination of world\r\npoverty is an imperative which the United Nations cannot\r\nignore. At the special mid-term review of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\r\n(UNCED), held in June of this year, we came close to\r\nagreeing to achieve this target by the year 2015. This\r\nyear, at the Kyoto session of the Conference of the\r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change, and later, at the mid-term review of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, we will\r\nhave other opportunities for the further promotion of\r\nsustainable development. We should not fail to take\r\nadvantage of these in our continuing efforts to create a\r\npartnership for the benefit of all States.\r\nFor its part, my Government remains dedicated to\r\nthis end. In demonstration of our seriousness of purpose,\r\nwe have honoured the obligations that have been deemed\r\nnecessary to national development. As suggested by the\r\nWorld Bank in its publication entitled Partnership for\r\nSustainable Growth, we have sought to promote\r\n“global governance in all its aspects, including\r\nensuring the rule of law, improving efficiency and\r\naccountability of the public sector and tackling\r\ncorruption as essential elements of a framework\r\nwithin which economies can prosper.”\r\nWe have created a truly democratic society in which\r\ndevelopment is a fundamental human right. The fruit of\r\nour policies has been a constant annual growth rate of\r\nover 6 per cent. Today, all sectors of our society,\r\nincluding private enterprise and peoples\u0027 organizations,\r\nare fully involved in the development process and are\r\nfired by the optimistic confidence that, as a nation, we\r\nwill overcome the problems that currently beset us.\r\nIn a few weeks, our nation will conduct another\r\ndemocratic election, open again to the scrutiny of\r\ninternational observers. Out of this exercise will come a\r\nfresh popular determination to continue along the path\r\nleading to economic and social progress. To facilitate this\r\npursuit, the Government has prepared a national\r\ndevelopment strategy based on a fully participatory\r\neconomy. Involved in its preparation were experts from\r\nboth the public and the private sectors, who have\r\nprepared a draft text for wider public consultation and\r\napproval. In our view, this provides a useful policy\r\nframework which, by establishing needs and priorities,\r\ncan serve to mobilize assistance from the international\r\ncommunity, including donor Governments and\r\ninternational development agencies.\r\nHowever, as was clearly recognized by our late\r\nPresident, Mr. Cheddi Jagan, the hopes and aspirations\r\nof developing countries such as ours will not fully\r\nmaterialize over the long term until the international\r\nenvironment is made more congenial to our needs.\r\nAccordingly, he continuously advocated in his lifetime\r\nthe creation of a new global human order premised on\r\nsustainable economic development, equity and social\r\nand ecological justice, and based on the creation of a\r\nseparate global development fund for assistance to both\r\nthe North and the South. This new North-South\r\npartnership must be fashioned in a search for more\r\npositive and innovative ways to cope with the vagaries\r\nof globalization and liberalization, which are\r\nmarginalizing millions of people and even many\r\nnations.\r\nGuyana has openly embraced the 20/20 initiative\r\nadopted at the World Summit for Social Development\r\nas a means of sparking international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. In addition, we have called for agreement\r\non some forms of international taxation, which, like\r\nnational revenue at the country level, would provide the\r\nfunding necessary to promote global development. Thus\r\nfar, some developed countries have been reluctant to\r\ncontemplate such innovative means of resource\r\nmobilization. But in circumstances of ever increasing\r\ninternational obligations and decreasing development\r\nassistance, where will the necessary financing come\r\nfrom? The answer to this question is key to the future\r\nof the United Nations, for unless the Organization is\r\nendowed with predictable and adequate resources, it\r\nwill be incapable of satisfying the many requirements\r\nplaced upon it by Member States.\r\nIn my delegation\u0027s view, the time has come to deal\r\nwith this issue. The Economic and Social Council has\r\nbroached the question in recent high-level discussions,\r\nbut we are a long way from testing the feasibility of the\r\nmany ideas that have been advanced to find new and\r\nadditional ways of financing multilateralism. Initial\r\nstudies done by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and other development agencies\r\nhave revealed that some of the mechanisms proposed\r\nare indeed feasible. Why, then, are some States\r\nunwilling to entertain any meaningful discussion of\r\ntheir introduction? Is it that they are afraid of losing\r\ncontrol of the United Nations? Or are they not serious\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nabout their proclaimed adherence to the concept of the\r\ninterdependence of States?\r\nAssuring the financial stability of this Organization\r\nmust be seen as essential not only to development but to\r\npeace. Invariably, instability and conflict within and\r\namong States are due in great measure to economic and\r\nsocial instability leading to intense competition for\r\nlimited resources. An investment in development must\r\ntherefore be seen as an investment in preventive\r\ndiplomacy and in the building of peace.\r\nAdmittedly, these are costly tasks, but there can be\r\nno doubt that the expenditure involved is much less than\r\nthat resulting from conflict. The international community\r\nshould therefore be prepared to adequately fund activities\r\nin this field to enhance the prospects of their success.\r\nApart from financial support, there is also a need for\r\nmore competent supervision by the Security Council. No\r\nreform of the United Nations will be complete without\r\nreform of the Council, which is the organ primarily\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. Unfortunately, despite the most intensive\r\nsearch, we are yet to find general agreement on the basis\r\nfor restructuring that important body. We must persevere,\r\nhowever, in the fulfilment of our mandate to devise a\r\nmore effective, open and representative Council fully\r\ncapable of performing the functions assigned to it under\r\nthe Charter.\r\nGuyana, as a member of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, believes that this aim can best be served by\r\nan appropriate expansion in the non-permanent category.\r\nHowever, in a spirit of compromise, we are prepared to\r\ncontemplate enlargement also in the permanent category,\r\nproviding a balance can be found between developed-\r\nand developing-country representation and agreement\r\nreached on the limitation of the use of the veto and on\r\nthe concept of periodic review. We are ready to continue\r\nour work in this direction until a solution is found.\r\nMeanwhile, we are happy to see the progress being\r\nmade towards the creation of an international criminal\r\ncourt, which will be able to deal effectively with several\r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nLast, but by no means least, we wish to see in the\r\ncampaign for peace more active interest and participation\r\nby this Assembly in the disarmament process, so that the\r\nweapons of war may be converted into tools of\r\ndevelopment. Although we have yet to see any significant\r\npeace dividend from the ending of the cold war, we\r\nbelieve that a reduction in arms expenditures on both\r\nnuclear and conventional weapons can only benefit the\r\nwelfare of all peoples. The Assembly must therefore\r\nencourage the Committee on Disarmament to intensify\r\nits efforts in this field and must itself take whatever\r\naction it deems necessary to prompt the conversion\r\nfrom arms production to more peaceful pursuits.\r\nDisarmament is too important an issue to be left to the\r\nmajor military Powers. The international community as\r\na whole must therefore exert continuing pressure on the\r\nprocess to achieve the desired results.\r\nAt the same time, we must intensify the\r\nOrganization\u0027s role in bringing peace to those countries\r\nand regions of the world where conflict or the threat of\r\nconflict persists. Upheavals in the Great Lakes region\r\nof Africa and the tenuous situation in places such as\r\nAfghanistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina still defy\r\nresolution.\r\nIn the Middle East, the peace process seems to\r\nhave atrophied. The Palestinian problem and the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict continue to hamper the progress of that\r\nentire area. In Cyprus, where tensions are restrained\r\nonly by the continued presence of United Nations\r\ntroops, the danger of violence is ever present. On the\r\nKorean Peninsula, peaceful reunification is still an\r\nelusive goal. The international community has no\r\nchoice but to do whatever it can to help the parties\r\ninvolved in conflict everywhere to work peacefully\r\ntowards an amicable settlement of their particular\r\ndisputes.\r\nThe world wants peace and development. It also\r\nwants the United Nations to help in the achievement of\r\nthese goals. Governments have a duty to heed these\r\nsentiments and to increase their support of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe United Nations itself must in turn reach out to\r\nbenefit from the valuable reservoir of goodwill which\r\nexists towards it among the peoples of the world.\r\nPublic information is key to securing widespread\r\nsupport for its activities and to expanding its role in\r\ninternational affairs. We therefore urge that the\r\ndissemination capacity of the Department of Public\r\nInformation be enhanced in developed countries, where\r\nawareness of the Organization\u0027s potential is less than it\r\nshould be.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nAs we approach the major milestone marking the\r\nstart of the third millennium, we must have a clear vision\r\nof what we want the United Nations to be and of what\r\nwe want it to do. Only with such clarity can we be sure\r\nthat the reform process will result in a change for the\r\nbetter. It is therefore my delegation\u0027s hope that this\r\ngeneral debate will engender a common sense of purpose\r\namong its Members and a willingness on their part to\r\npress forward in the revitalization of an Organization\r\nwhich is so necessary to both our survival and our\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Mr. Lloyd Axworthy.\r\nMr. Axworthy (Canada): May I first take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate my very good friend, the\r\nForeign Minister of Ukraine, on his election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session and to\r\nconvey to him the best wishes of Canada for a successful\r\nand productive association in this session. I know from\r\nour long personal contacts that the course of this\r\nimportant debate is in the best possible hands.\r\nLet me also take the opportunity to thank and\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Razali for his tireless and\r\neffective leadership of the General Assembly at the fifty-\r\nfirst session.\r\nI come to the Assembly today with a sense of\r\nurgency and an abiding faith and belief that we are now\r\nemerging, not only from the shadows of the cold war, but\r\nalso from the uncertainties of its aftermath.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAround the world, we see countless examples of the\r\nbasic principles and overall vision of the United Nations\r\nCharter being put into practice. The people of the world\r\nare laying the foundations of a new international system\r\nfor the new millennium.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOf course, I recognize that no part of the world is\r\nwithout its burdens of conflict, grief and personal\r\nsuffering. Nor are there any great signs of relief from the\r\ngrowing burden of global economic inequities. What has\r\nchanged, however, is the new international willingness to\r\nface the issues, to mobilize political will and to launch\r\nreforms. There is a sense, not of helplessness, but of\r\nhope. The old realities of power have not disappeared,\r\nbut alongside them have appeared new forces, new\r\ncoalitions and new ways of doing business — and these\r\nforces are impatient. As we have seen, in fact, in recent\r\ndays, one person\u0027s vision and generosity can make a\r\ndifference and stand as an inspiration to us all.\r\nThis new spirit needs to be manifest and inspire\r\nthe work of the United Nations. The Secretary-General\r\nhas proposed a serious and far-sighted set of reforms.\r\nCanada strongly supports these proposals and accepts\r\nthem as a package. They promise not simply greater\r\nefficiency, but, we hope, greater effectiveness. Based\r\non our experiences in Canada, I can say with some\r\nauthority that budget-cutting by itself is not the answer.\r\nThere must be serious structural change to modernize\r\nexisting institutions, both national and international, that\r\nwere formed over 50 years ago.\r\nTo undertake these reforms, solutions must be\r\nbased on agreement and cooperation. Solutions cannot\r\nbe imposed by one country or one group, but rather\r\nmust be inspired by a sense of openness and\r\ninnovation. In other words, we must establish a new\r\ncompact amongst United Nations Members to set this\r\nOrganization on a sound financial footing. As\r\nMr. Udovenko has said, we are at a watershed, a\r\ndefining moment for the Organization that can either\r\nprovide new momentum or stall our advance. The\r\ndirection we take is ours collectively to decide and the\r\noutcome in all our hands. We must not waste this\r\nopportunity.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAnother defining moment, I believe, took place\r\njust over a week ago in Oslo. Ninety nations, spurred\r\non by the efforts of the non-governmental\r\norganizations, agreed on the text of a treaty banning\r\nanti-personnel landmines. The treaty will be signed this\r\ncoming December, just 14 months after it was first\r\nconceived.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWhile visiting the treaty discussions in Oslo, I was\r\nforcibly struck by how what has become known as the\r\nOttawa process demonstrates the changed character of\r\nworld affairs. Above all, it shows how the breakdown\r\nof the old bipolar world affords new opportunities for\r\ncivil society, private individuals, to influence\r\nmultilateral diplomacy. The focus of the Ottawa process\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nis a weapon that slaughters countless civilians, a weapon\r\nthat has lost much of its military utility, whatever some\r\nmay say. This illustrates the growing feeling, coming\r\nfrom the grass roots of the world community, that the\r\nengines of war designed for the twentieth century have\r\nno place in the twenty-first.\r\nI should say that this is not the only example of the\r\nnew grass-roots activism which points to the emergence\r\nof a global commons as a powerful positive force of\r\nglobalization. For example, Canadian women, appalled at\r\nthe treatment of their sisters in Afghanistan, have started\r\na letter-writing campaign. I will be delivering some 5,000\r\nletters today to the Secretary-General, which call on him\r\nto take the lead in exposing the gross human rights\r\nviolations of women in Afghanistan as unacceptable in\r\nthe eyes of the world\u0027s citizens.\r\nThe effectiveness of these new forces can be clearly\r\nmeasured. Nations from every region of the world have\r\npledged to sign on to a complete ban on the stockpiling,\r\nproduction, export and use of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nWe hope to see more join our ranks between now and\r\nDecember. For those who are still on the sidelines, we\r\nask them to think hard and deep on this issue. Their\r\nengagement is crucial. By joining us, already a majority\r\nof United Nations Member States, they can help rid the\r\nworld of this most inhumane weapon.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada recently announced its intention to destroy\r\nits remaining stocks of anti-personnel mines before\r\nsignature of the treaty. We will also shortly ratify the\r\namended Protocol II of the Convention on Certain\r\nConventional Weapons.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThis treaty constitutes a promise to future\r\ngenerations. But it does not resolve the equally grave\r\nproblems posed by mines already in the ground, nor does\r\nit address the plight of those who have experienced\r\ndirectly their dreadful impact.\r\nFollowing the signing of the treaty, the international\r\ncommunity will have an obligation to develop policies for\r\nan enhanced and coordinated approach to humanitarian\r\ndemining, and to victim assistance and rehabilitation.\r\nThis is, as much as anything else, a development\r\nissue. Heavily mined areas of the world cannot pursue\r\neconomic development until they have been demined;\r\nand demining is a hopeless task if there is no treaty to\r\nprevent the laying of new mines.\r\nAt Ottawa in December, we will invite nations to\r\nengage in a second phase of the campaign: a broad\r\nmobilization of groups and countries to tackle the\r\naftermath of the landmines crisis. It is a monumental\r\ntask, to be met only through the combined action of all\r\nStates. We invite all present to join us. The generosity\r\nof private citizens such as Ted Turner, or of the Auto\r\nWorkers\u0027 Union of Canada, and the commitment of\r\nthose like Princess Diana must be matched, indeed\r\nsurpassed, by the Governments of this world.\r\nIt is important to ask what is behind this\r\nwillingness to tackle these old problems in a new way?\r\nWhat has brought us to the intersection of high hopes\r\nand new strategies, and the real ability to effect change\r\nin the world, as exemplified by the landmines\r\ncampaign? To my mind, these developments and, above\r\nall the recognition of the need to adopt new approaches,\r\nare in part a response to the changing face of war.\r\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, we\r\nhave seen one type of conflict become prevalent. These\r\nare wars fought within, not between, States; wars that\r\ntend to be long and bitter; and wars, above all, in which\r\ncivilians suffer the most and children and women are\r\noften deliberately targeted. These are wars in which, in\r\nthe words of Saint-Exupéry “the firing line passes\r\nthrough the hearts of people”.\r\nAs this type of war increasingly accounts for the\r\ngreat majority of all conflicts, the distinctions that once\r\ninformed the work of international diplomacy —\r\nbetween military security concerns and humanitarian or\r\ncivil concerns — break down. This blurring of the\r\nlines, along with heightened media presence, has\r\nstrongly affected international opinion. Fewer and fewer\r\npeople are willing to view war as an acceptable\r\ninstrument of state policy.\r\nIn the light of these changes, the concept of\r\nhuman security, which I highlighted when I addressed\r\nthe Assembly last year, takes on growing relevance. It\r\nis based on the premise that it is not enough to spare\r\npeople from the “scourge of war” narrowly defined.\r\nEnsuring true, sustainable human security means\r\ntackling other severe threats: the unmet needs of more\r\nthan a billion people living in poverty; attacks on\r\nhuman rights of individuals and groups within society;\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\ntransnational threats, such as crime and terrorism; and\r\nthreats to health and livelihood through depletion or\r\npollution of our resources.\r\nThe problems of these new global issues will not\r\nwait for long-term solutions. It is urgent that we take\r\naction to prevent or reduce the incidence of conflict, to\r\nrestore societies in the aftermath of conflict and to\r\nincrease human security around the world.\r\nThe priorities for action can, in my view, be\r\ngrouped under three main headings: addressing issues\r\nwhich cut across traditional boundaries between areas of\r\nconcern, such as we have in the landmines campaign;\r\nidentifying and addressing the root causes of conflict; and\r\nimproving our ability to respond to crises when we\r\ncannot prevent them.\r\nLet me talk about that first priority. Landmines are\r\nnot the only complex, cross-cutting problem to be\r\naddressed if we are to reduce the impact of conflict. All\r\ntoo often it is small arms, rather than the major weapons\r\nsystems targeted by our disarmament efforts, that cause\r\nthe greatest bloodshed. In the hands of terrorists,\r\ncriminals, the irregular militia and armed bands typical of\r\ninternal conflict, these are the true weapons of mass\r\nterror. As with landmines, their victims are all too often\r\ncivilians.\r\nWe welcome the recent report of the United Nations\r\nPanel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms and\r\ndiscussions within the United Nations Disarmament\r\nCommission on disarming combatants as a step towards\r\nmore lasting peace. These should serve as the launching\r\npad from which to develop practical measures, in\r\nconsultation with regional bodies.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nTo tackle this problem, the first steps must be to\r\ncombat illicit trafficking in firearms and to bring greater\r\ntransparency to the legal exportation of small arms. The\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) is currently\r\nworking towards an Inter-American convention on illicit\r\ntrafficking in firearms. Canada hopes that the OAS\r\nnegotiations will result in an effective convention and\r\nwill also inspire other regional bodies to take action.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nRidding the world of anti-personnel landmines and\r\nbanning or limiting other forms of weapons directly\r\nreduce the human suffering caused by conflict. The\r\nother side of the same coin is building and enhancing\r\nhuman security. By building peace, reducing\r\nunsustainable military expenditures, promoting equitable\r\nand sustainable development and encouraging stable,\r\ndemocratic societies which respect human rights, we\r\nnot only limit human suffering, but we also address the\r\nroot causes of conflict itself.\r\nTo do this requires solutions that are built from\r\nthe inside, not imposed from the outside. Sustainable\r\npeace can be built only through the active cooperation\r\nand participation of Governments, peoples, and groups\r\ncaught in the conflict itself.\r\nAt the same time, a parallel effort is required to\r\nreform the United Nations development funds and\r\nprogrammes. Canada strongly supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s reform proposals in this area. We place\r\npriority on improving coordination within the United\r\nNations system at the country level, including among\r\nthe specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, in order to maximize development impact.\r\nCanada, through diplomacy and development\r\nassistance, has supported peace-building activities in\r\ncertain regions for many years. To give further impetus\r\nto this approach, last October I announced the Canadian\r\npeace-building initiative. Its aim is to coordinate\r\nCanadian programmes and policies in support of\r\nconflict prevention and resolution, peace-building and\r\npost-conflict reconstruction. A peace-building\r\nmechanism or fund has provided a rapid response\r\nmechanism in areas of conflict.\r\nOver the last six months, we have used this peace-\r\nbuilding fund for the following purposes: to provide\r\ncritical start-up funding for the historical clarification\r\nCommission in Guatemala; to assist the preparatory\r\ncommission for the establishment of an international\r\ncriminal court by underwriting the participation of\r\ndelegates from developing countries; and to provide\r\nfinancial assistance for the work of the joint United\r\nNations/Organization of African Unity (OAU) Special\r\nRepresentative for the Great Lakes region of Africa,\r\nMr. Mohamed Sahnoun.\r\nIn addition, Canada is prepared to contribute up to\r\n$500,000 from this fund for the establishment in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina of a non-governmental organization\r\nfoundation to develop civil society on the basis of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nmulti-ethnic cooperation. I urge other members to join us\r\nin supporting this foundation.\r\nFinally, I am pleased to announce a Canadian\r\ncontribution of $500,000 from the peace-building fund to\r\nthe new United Nations Trust Fund for Preventive\r\nAction, created by the Secretary-General in response to a\r\nproposal from the Norwegian Government.\r\nA second promising area of work on the root causes\r\nof conflict lies in exploring the links between security\r\nand development, and particularly in reducing levels of\r\nmilitary expenditures relative to economic and social\r\nspending. Last year Canada sponsored, together with the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD) a symposium on military expenditures in\r\ndeveloping countries which brought together a wide range\r\nof experts who identified areas for further action: small-\r\narms proliferation, about which I have just spoken,\r\nregional security, good governance and the rule of law.\r\nThe United Nations has established important tools\r\nto build the confidence necessary for reductions in\r\nmilitary spending, in the form of the United Nations\r\nRegister of Conventional Arms and the United Nations\r\nstandardized reports on national military expenditures.\r\nMuch more work is needed, particularly at the regional\r\nlevel, to identify ways to reduce military spending and to\r\nredirect scarce national resources to the economic and\r\nsocial development goals.\r\nA third area of attention is work on conflict that\r\ncomes from threats to environmental sustainability.\r\nEnvironmental problems have the capacity to imperil\r\nliving standards and to endanger the well-being of future\r\ngenerations. For these reasons, Canada strongly supports\r\nnew agreements on hazardous chemicals, including\r\npersistent organic pollutants, and will work to ensure the\r\nsuccess of the new intergovernmental forum on forests.\r\nCombating desertification also remains a priority for us,\r\nand we have offered to host the Desertification\r\nConvention secretariat.\r\nThe fourth and final promising area in addressing\r\nthe root causes of conflict is human rights and good\r\ngovernance. Next year we celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. This is an opportunity for all of us to reaffirm\r\nstrongly the fundamental importance of this document\r\nand our commitment to the common standards it sets out.\r\nIn recognition of the importance of this\r\nanniversary, Canada will be sponsoring a broad\r\nprogramme of activities, including a major world\r\nconference on human rights and the Internet, to draw\r\ntogether work being done in many international forums,\r\nwith a focus on strategies for using the new\r\ninternational telecommunications technology to increase\r\nrespect for human rights. We are working on the\r\ndevelopment and publication of an annual report on the\r\nstate of human rights worldwide, based on the findings\r\nof the United Nations independent human rights\r\nmechanisms. And we will hold a conference reviewing\r\nthe impact of the 1993 Vienna Declaration, to be held\r\nby Canadian non-governmental organizations.\r\nAbuse of human rights is sometimes excused as\r\nnecessary in the interests of stability and national\r\nsecurity, but the facts show otherwise. Countries with\r\ndemocratic governments which respect the fundamental\r\nrights of their citizens are less likely to wage war on\r\none another. They are also more likely over time to\r\nachieve high levels of economic development.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nRecognizing this, Canada has recently undertaken\r\na series of new bilateral human rights initiatives. Our\r\naim is to work with our counterparts in other countries\r\nto establish discussions between governments to foster\r\nexchanges between institutions devoted to the protection\r\nof human rights and civil-society initiatives and projects\r\nfor the development of free media.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe also fully support the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals for reform measures to enhance United\r\nNations work in human rights. And we welcome the\r\nappointment of Mary Robinson as High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights, and offer her our support.\r\nAs we move towards the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the challenges\r\nfacing the international community, if anything, have\r\nincreased. The trend towards targeting civilians in\r\nwarfare has resulted in severe infringements of the\r\nbasic rights of women and children. Too often we have\r\nseen children recruited as soldiers or women subjected\r\nto sexual assault as a deliberate weapon of terror.\r\nCanada continues to make the rights of the child\r\nand of women, both in conflict and in peace, a top\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nhuman rights priority, which we pursue actively in the\r\nUnited Nations and elsewhere. We welcome the\r\nappointment of Mr. Olara Otunnu as Special\r\nRepresentative to study the impact of armed conflict on\r\nchildren. We will shortly host a preparatory meeting for\r\nthe main donor countries invited to the Oslo child labour\r\nconference. And domestically we have launched a Child\r\nLabour Challenge Fund to support the efforts of our\r\nprivate sector to address the problem of exploitative child\r\nlabour.\r\nNowhere is the link between human rights and\r\nhuman security clearer than in the issue of children’s\r\nrights. By protecting the basic rights of the world’s\r\nchildren, we are nurturing a future generation of citizens\r\nwith both the means and the desire to live in peace.\r\nThe final overall priority for action is crisis\r\nresponse. And despite our best efforts, there will be times\r\nwhen conflict looms, or when it cannot be prevented.\r\nThese situations call for rapid, decisive action, whether to\r\nforestall conflict or contain it when it breaks out. These\r\nactions include not only peacekeeping and other military\r\nmeasures, but also humanitarian and judicial responses.\r\nTo date, the international community appears to\r\nhave identified the lessons that the missions to Somalia,\r\nBosnia, Rwanda and Zaire have taught us, but not to\r\nhave learned from them. In crisis situations, speed is the\r\nkey to effective response. This is why Canada has been\r\nso active in efforts to develop a United Nations rapid-\r\nresponse and deployment capability, in particular a\r\nrapidly deployable mission headquarters here in New\r\nYork. This would not only permit the timely insertion of\r\nmilitary forces, but also integrate civilian and\r\nhumanitarian organizations into mission planning and\r\ndeployment.\r\nCanada hopes to see measurable progress on the\r\nrapidly deployable headquarters and on the Danish-led\r\nStandby Forces High-Readiness Brigade initiative. These\r\nimprovements to the United Nations rapid-response\r\ncapability are complementary, feasible and should be\r\nimplemented without delay. Let us learn our lesson, and\r\nnot ignore it once again.\r\nIn addition to rapid military and humanitarian\r\nreaction, a key element of the United Nations response to\r\nconflict is the application of justice and the international\r\nrule of law. Canada strongly supports the timely\r\nestablishment of an independent, effective international\r\ncriminal court. In order to be effective, the court must\r\nhave inherent jurisdiction over the core crimes of\r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In\r\norder to be independent, the court must not be\r\nprecluded from dealing with matters on the Security\r\nCouncil agenda.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that, as we all recognize,\r\nthe United Nations was originally established as an\r\ninstrument of international peace. Since that time, war\r\nhas put on a new face. More and more, it has targeted\r\nprimarily civilian populations. If the United Nations is\r\nto be effective — and I believe that the need for\r\neffective multilateralism has never been greater — the\r\nUnited Nations must adapt to this changing face of war.\r\nAt the same time, the United Nations must also\r\nrecognize that it, too, has changed at its very\r\nfoundation. Both its membership and its mandate have\r\nexpanded, and the growing importance of United\r\nNations development and humanitarian activities have\r\nmade their mark. Clearly, it is time for concerted\r\nreflection on the purpose and functioning of this body\r\nthat we have built together — including on the difficult\r\nissues of financing and reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe reform and expansion of the Security Council\r\nis a major undertaking of direct concern to all Member\r\nStates. The long-term implications must be fully\r\ndebated and carefully weighed, and the process must be\r\nfair and open. It must attract a broad consensus and\r\ncannot be rushed to accommodate other goals —\r\nincluding a short-term solution to the United Nations\r\nfinancial crisis. Canada wants to see a Security Council\r\nthat is effective, transparent, broadly representative and,\r\nabove all, less elitist and more democratic. The primary\r\ncriteria for membership should be commitment to the\r\nideals and undertakings of the United Nations and a\r\nwillingness to remain always accountable to the full\r\nmembership of this Assembly.\r\nBroader United Nations reform must necessarily\r\nfail so long as Member States continue to demand more\r\nof a system to which they contribute less. Effective\r\nleadership and moral authority are rooted in respect for\r\nundertakings and obligations freely entered into by\r\nMember States. It is the responsibility of each and\r\nevery Member to pay its dues. These obligations apply\r\nin full, on time and without conditions.\r\nLooking ahead, there may be a time when we will\r\nchoose to reconsider aspects of the current financial\r\nunderpinnings of the United Nations. Indeed, we may\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\ncollectively decide that in order to broaden\r\nresponsibilities and share power in ways that better\r\nreflect current international realities, some adjustments to\r\nthe scale of assessments are warranted. Such decisions,\r\nhowever, can be neither prejudged nor presumed, and\r\nwould no doubt be influenced by the commitment of\r\nthose advocating such changes to the broader purposes of\r\nthis Organization.\r\nThe international context in which the United\r\nNations functions has changed profoundly. Around the\r\nworld, people are reshaping the way they live — be it by\r\nseeking more food, better air or greater democracy.\r\nCrucial to this massive transformation is the search for\r\nsecurity, through both the reduction of conflict and the\r\nbuilding of a better life in times of peace. The United\r\nNations has long symbolized these dual hopes, for escape\r\nfrom “the scourge of war” and for “better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom”.\r\nI close my remarks today on a note of hope, quoting\r\nPresident Václav Havel of the Czech Republic, who said,\r\n“Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism.\r\nIt is not a conviction that something will turn out\r\nwell, but the certainty that something makes sense,\r\nregardless of how it turns out.”\r\nOur hope lies in the certainty that the United Nations, as\r\nthe standard-bearer of international values, of a sense of\r\nmultilateralism and of a sense of cooperation and\r\npartnership, makes sense for all of us. This must spur us\r\non in this Assembly for the challenges that lie ahead.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland, His Excellency\r\nMr. Ray Burke. I give him the floor.\r\nMr. Burke (Ireland): I would like to offer Foreign\r\nMinister Udovenko of Ukraine my warmest\r\ncongratulations on his election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session. His skill\r\nand experience will serve us well in directing the vital\r\nwork to be undertaken at this session. Ireland, and you,\r\nAmbassador Campbell as Vice-President of the General\r\nAssembly, will spare no effort in assisting the President\r\nin the important tasks of his office.\r\nI also wish to thank Ambassador Razali Ismail for\r\nthe energy and commitment he devoted to guiding the\r\nAssembly at its last session.\r\nMy colleague Foreign Minister Poos of\r\nLuxembourg, speaking on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, set out clearly in his speech to the Assembly the\r\nagenda for action by the United Nations and its\r\nMember States in facing the challenges of the world\r\ntoday. Ireland associates itself fully with his remarks.\r\nThis session is a crucial one for the United\r\nNations. Decisions must be taken to make the United\r\nNations more effective in meeting its real objectives\r\nand priorities in future years. The Secretary-General has\r\npresented us with a considered, balanced and substantial\r\npackage of proposals for United Nations reform. This\r\npackage marks a turning point in the reform and\r\nrevitalization process. The Secretary-General has\r\nrecognized that the future of the United Nations can be\r\nsecured only by a clearer focus and better coordination\r\nof effort, expertise and resources on the key\r\npriorities — real peace and security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, equitable economic and social progress,\r\nhumanitarian action and, underlying all of these, the\r\nsafeguarding of universal human rights.\r\nIreland welcomes in particular the proposals for a\r\nmore concerted effort in the economic and social\r\ndevelopment sector. Together with our European Union\r\npartners, we have been developing our own contribution\r\nin this area. Our aim is a more effective and coherent\r\nUnited Nations effort which would finally make real\r\ninroads, particularly in the least developed countries, in\r\nthe fight against poverty and underdevelopment. We\r\nwelcome the intention of the Secretary-General to\r\nchannel the resources saved in this exercise to\r\ndevelopment programmes of the Organization.\r\nI know that some will feel that the proposals do\r\nnot go far enough in one direction, and others in\r\nanother. It is not possible to accommodate fully all\r\nconcerns. But there is enough in these proposals to\r\nmake the start on reform that we have all been looking\r\nfor. I therefore earnestly appeal to all Member States to\r\njoin this broad consensus of support.\r\nWe should also, at this session, work to achieve a\r\nsolution to the difficult questions of the financing of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the enlargement and working\r\nmethods of the Security Council. Ireland, my country,\r\nhas declared its candidacy for the Security Council in\r\nthe year 2000. We shall do everything possible to earn\r\nsupport for our candidacy.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nLiving through times of dramatic change is rarely\r\neasy. Globalization and liberalization of the international\r\neconomy have brought significant benefits to many\r\ncountries and are changing the shape of our world. Some\r\ndeveloping countries have benefited from these processes\r\nand made significant economic and social strides. Others,\r\nespecially in sub-Saharan Africa, have become even more\r\nmarginalized from the world economy, and this is\r\nunacceptable.\r\nIreland has been increasing its official-development-\r\nassistance budget over a number of years. My\r\nGovernment is committed to making steady progress\r\ntowards achieving the United Nations target of 0.7 per\r\ncent in our development-cooperation assistance.\r\nSpecifically, we are committed to having Irish aid reach\r\n0.45 per cent of gross national product by 2002.\r\nSome critics contend that development cooperation\r\nhas not succeeded. The best response to this is to point to\r\nwhat it has already achieved. In regard to the most\r\nfundamental of all human rights, life expectancy around\r\nthe world has increased by a third in the past three\r\ndecades; infant mortality has been cut in half. These are\r\nnot small achievements.\r\nIn our present globalized and increasingly\r\ninterdependent world economy, we need to seek a new\r\npartnership between developed and developing countries\r\nto address those issues which affect the entire\r\ninternational community. In this the United Nations has\r\nan indispensable role to play, and we pledge our full\r\nsupport to assist the Secretary-General in his task.\r\nIn June 1998 the General Assembly will meet in\r\nspecial session to address the drugs issue, both at the\r\nnational and international levels. I had the honour, as\r\nMinister of Justice and in the role of President of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of the European Union, to address\r\nthe General Assembly on this question in 1990. The\r\nAssembly has regularly considered further action to deal\r\nwith this menace. But the action that has been taken so\r\nfar has clearly been inadequate. We must redouble our\r\nefforts. Drugs are an international cancer which threaten\r\nthe lives of the present and future generations,\r\nparticularly our young. For all our people, they pose a\r\nreal threat to the very fabric of society.\r\nLast week saw the conclusion of negotiations in\r\nOslo on a global Convention banning landmines, without\r\nreservation, without exception and for all time. This\r\nmajor step forward will be particularly welcomed by\r\nthose countries which have suffered so much as a result\r\nof the use of these barbaric devices. Those countries\r\nnot present there and not yet ready to sign in December\r\nmust take account of the widespread international\r\nsupport for this agreement. We appeal to them to help\r\nensure the maximum degree of adherence to the\r\nConvention. The international community must now\r\nwork together with ever greater determination to\r\nprovide for the clearing of mines already placed and for\r\nthe care and rehabilitation, as well as the social and\r\neconomic reintegration, of mine victims.\r\nIn 1961, when the then-Foreign Minister of\r\nIreland, Mr. Frank Aiken, introduced a resolution at the\r\nsixteenth session of the General Assembly calling for\r\nthe conclusion of an international agreement that would\r\nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons, he launched a\r\nprocess which the Irish Government firmly believed\r\nwould eventually lead to total nuclear disarmament.\r\nThen as now, our conviction was that genuine\r\ninternational peace and security can never be achieved\r\nas long as nuclear weapons remain part of the\r\narmouries of States.\r\nWe welcome the achievements of recent years,\r\nwhether bilateral or multilateral: the START Treaties,\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the global\r\nban outlawing chemical weapons and present efforts to\r\nstrengthen the ban on biological and toxin weapons.\r\nThese show that with the necessary will progress is\r\npossible.\r\nNow is the time for serious consideration of an\r\nintegrated approach, encompassing both bilateral and\r\nmultilateral negotiations, culminating in an international\r\nagreement on a total ban on nuclear weapons. We must\r\ninject a real sense of urgency into translating the goal\r\nof the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons into a\r\nmore concrete reality. My plea is for reflection on the\r\npart of all; for compromise and for cooperation, and for\r\na flexible rather than a dogmatic approach. I believe\r\nthat we can offer no better vision, courage and\r\nleadership in the service of peace than to take up this\r\nchallenge.\r\nWhile we can look forward one day to a world\r\nfree of nuclear weapons, no time should be lost in\r\nagreeing how the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can\r\nbest be managed. We in Ireland live in close proximity\r\nto a nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant which poses a\r\nconsiderable threat to us because of the ever-present\r\nrisk of a major accident at the plant. In many countries\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\ntoday, nuclear energy is viewed with alarm and\r\napprehension. Public resistance has persuaded some\r\nGovernments to renounce the nuclear option because the\r\nbenefits of nuclear energy have failed to convince a\r\nsceptical and questioning public.\r\nThe impact of accidents involving nuclear-power\r\nreactors can cross international frontiers. The legitimate\r\ninterests of States affected by such accidents demand that\r\nhigh priority be given to strengthening nuclear safety\r\nworldwide. Reactor safety and the closure of sub-standard\r\nreactors represent for my Government fundamental\r\nnecessities that nuclear-energy States must meet.\r\nIt is simply unacceptable that poor management of\r\nradioactive waste and spent fuel should threaten the\r\nhealth and safety of populations or cause serious long-\r\nterm damage to the environment of States which have no\r\nnuclear programmes. The recent Joint Convention dealing\r\nwith these matters will hopefully bring about\r\nimprovements. However, much more needs to be done\r\nthrough international cooperation to allay the deep\r\nmisgivings of a concerned public.\r\nTransport of nuclear materials and radioactive waste\r\nraises the most serious and justifiable fears. We must\r\ninsist that this, along with all other nuclear activities, be\r\ncarried out in strict accordance with the highest\r\ninternational standards of safety and security.\r\nFurthermore, the entirely legitimate sensitivities of transit\r\ncountries affected by such movements must be\r\nrecognized.\r\nAs we approach next year\u0027s celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, we must recognize that we have fallen\r\nshort in implementing the goals and aspirations of the\r\nDeclaration. While recognizing that none of us has\r\ngrounds for complacency in this regard, it is a reality that\r\nthe human rights situation in certain countries remains of\r\nparticular concern to the international community. The\r\nEuropean Union, in its memorandum to the General\r\nAssembly, has listed the areas of particular concern to us,\r\nincluding the human rights situation in Myanmar, East\r\nTimor, Nigeria and Afghanistan, to name but a few.\r\nWe must all work together — Governments and\r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society\r\ngenerally — in dialogue and partnership to ensure that\r\nthe human rights principles enshrined in the Charter and\r\nthe Universal Declaration are respected to the full.\r\nThe current reforms proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in particular his decision to consolidate the\r\ntwo existing human rights offices into a single office of\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, are to be\r\nwelcomed. They provide a clear opportunity to\r\nstrengthen significantly the human rights programme of\r\nthe United Nations by fully integrating human rights\r\nissues across the full range of United Nations activities.\r\nIt is a cause of great pride to the Government and the\r\npeople of Ireland that the Secretary-General has chosen\r\nMrs. Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland,\r\nas the new High Commissioner.\r\nI wish to turn now to an area of United Nations\r\nactivity which is of particular concern and interest to\r\nmy country — that of peacekeeping. Ireland has a\r\nproud record of service in almost every major United\r\nNations peacekeeping operation. We will continue this\r\nrole, including our contribution of personnel from the\r\nIrish police force — the Garda Siochána — to the new\r\nand important role for civilian police in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nOur peacekeepers have at times paid a heavy\r\nprice: some 75 Irish peacekeepers have died in the\r\nservice of United Nations peacekeeping.\r\nOur support for the role of the United Nations in\r\nits peacekeeping role has not wavered. But it is\r\ntempered by the sober recognition that, despite many\r\nsignificant successes in past decades, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping, particularly in recent times, has not\r\nalways been effective. We must become better at\r\naverting conflicts, through more vigorous preventive\r\ndiplomacy and action in dealing with the roots of\r\nconflict. When we are forced to intervene, our response\r\nmust be prompt and better informed through effective\r\nearly warning systems. Our tasks and objectives must\r\nbe better defined, both as regards keeping the peace and\r\nmaking the peace. The full support, political and\r\nmaterial, of the Member States is essential if they are to\r\nbe achieved effectively.\r\nToo often the United Nations has been asked, to\r\nits cost, to keep the peace indefinitely in conflict areas,\r\nwithout any corresponding efforts by the parties to the\r\nconflict to make peace. All Member States of this\r\nOrganization have a responsibility to ensure continuous\r\nand honest efforts to make the peace permanent.\r\nThe changing international situation of the last\r\ndecade has seen the emergence of new sources of\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nconflict and tension. Old ethnic rivalries and hatreds have\r\nresurfaced, leading to new local and regional conflicts. In\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the killing has stopped, but\r\nprogress in building the peace has been painfully slow. In\r\nthe Middle East, too, moving the peace process forward\r\nis proving enormously more difficult than could have\r\nbeen imagined. We call on all parties to live up to their\r\nresponsibilities and put the process back on track. In\r\nCyprus, in the Great Lakes region of Africa and in many\r\nother places, the serious efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to secure lasting peace are making very slow\r\nheadway.\r\nIn the island of Ireland, we face the task of forging\r\nreconciliation and, leaving behind us the bitterness of\r\nhistory, ensuring that the root causes of the threat to\r\npeace are addressed effectively.\r\nSuccessive Irish Foreign Ministers have addressed\r\nthis Assembly over the years and informed\r\nrepresentatives of the efforts being made to resolve the\r\nconflict in Northern Ireland and bring about a lasting\r\npeaceful settlement. They have brought news of\r\nsignificant advances, from the launching of the\r\nintergovernmental approach by Ireland and Britain in\r\n1980 and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in\r\n1985, to the formulation of the Joint Declaration in 1993\r\nand the publication of the Joint Framework document in\r\n1995.\r\nI now bring to the Assembly the joyous news that\r\nyesterday in Belfast we succeeded in launching\r\nsubstantial and historic all-party talks in which the future\r\nof a peaceful and agreed Ireland is to be mapped out.\r\nWhat is notable about all of these developments — each\r\nan important foundation stone in the current peace\r\nprocess — is that they were undertaken in partnership\r\nbetween the Irish and British Governments. Progress has\r\nbeen driven by our two Governments, united in the quest\r\nfor peace and a lasting and just settlement. That progress\r\nhas been defined and directed by the concept of the\r\n“totality of relationships”, with which our two islands are\r\nintertwined and which bears directly on the question of\r\nNorthern Ireland. Northern Ireland represents the\r\ninterface between the respective traditions and future\r\naspirations of both Ireland and Britain. Only in the\r\ntotality of our relations can we come to terms with our\r\ndiffering visions of the past and reconcile our hopes for\r\nthe future.\r\nThe notion of the “totality of relationships” has been\r\nreinforced recently by profound shifts in political and\r\nsocial attitudes in both Ireland and Britain. The\r\ncharacter of these shifts has much in common in that\r\nthey serve to illustrate the commonality that the peoples\r\nof Ireland and Britain share.\r\nIreland has been undergoing a dramatic and\r\ninvigorating process of renewal. This has been most\r\nevident in our economic performance, but it is evident\r\ntoo in our social and cultural life. I have a deep sense\r\nthat it has been encouraged and shaped by our\r\ninvolvement in the evolution of Europe and the\r\ndevelopment of our multilateral relations through the\r\nUnited Nations itself. This renewal has been marked by\r\ninspiration about what can be done and by what is\r\nneeded pragmatically to achieve what we set out to do.\r\nIn Britain, there has been a dramatic development\r\nwhich redefines and reshapes the nature of its political\r\nunion. And we too detect that same impulse to\r\nreinvigorate the institutions of the state, to undertake a\r\nreappraisal and a renewal as the new millennium\r\napproaches.\r\nI believe that this sense of change in both islands,\r\nthis quickening pace, will be a very important factor as\r\nboth Governments and all the parties to the negotiations\r\nin Northern Ireland take the peace process forward. It\r\nwill, I believe, impart an urgency and focus to the\r\ndeliberations. More importantly, it means that those\r\nwho form part of the talks process have the opportunity\r\nto shape their future rather than surrender through\r\nindifference or apathy to the inexorability of change.\r\nFor we live in a time which offers an invitation to\r\nshape our common future. That invitation is open to all\r\nthose with the courage and vision to participate in the\r\ntalks process, which seeks to reshape the relations\r\nwhich are central to the solution we seek — relations\r\nbetween the two communities in Northern Ireland,\r\nrelations between the North and the South of our island,\r\nand relations between Ireland and Britain.\r\nThe efforts of both Governments to construct the\r\ncomplex structures on which to base a peace process\r\nwere undertaken with the very clear acknowledgment\r\nthat ultimately it was there to serve all the parties most\r\ndirectly involved in the conflict and, through them, the\r\nwider community. As the leader of the Social\r\nDemocratic and Labour Party (SDLP), John Hume, so\r\nclearly recognized, it had to be an inclusive peace\r\nprocess if it was to be a lasting one.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nCreating the conditions for this inclusive process\r\nwas a difficult task in the face of continued violence by\r\nparamilitaries on both sides — violence which has been\r\nongoing for over 25 years; violence which threatened to\r\nlimit the boundaries of a whole generation to suspicion,\r\nmutual mistrust and division; violence which still seeks to\r\nthreaten and disrupt our efforts to build a lasting peace.\r\nThe task of creating an inclusive peace process\r\nrequired us to call on our friends in the international\r\ncommunity. I want to acknowledge those friends,\r\nparticularly in the European Union, Canada, Australia,\r\nNew Zealand and, most important, in the United States.\r\nThe partnership between Ireland and Britain has\r\nbeen consistently encouraged and assisted by the United\r\nStates under the leadership of President Clinton and with\r\nthe backing of friends and supporters in the United States\r\nCongress. In particular, President Clinton offered his\r\npersonal support and active engagement in the search for\r\npeace. The President undertook to share the risks for\r\npeace which were being taken by both Governments. And\r\nin doing so, he added significantly to the momentum\r\nwhich secured the ceasefire in 1994 and re-established it\r\nin July of this year.\r\nThe United States has been a resource offered\r\ngenerously in the name of peace. I want to acknowledge\r\nthe invaluable role played by Senator George Mitchell in\r\nchairing the multi-party talks in Belfast. And I also want\r\nto express my Government\u0027s appreciation for the\r\ncooperation and assistance provided by the Governments\r\nof Finland and Canada, particularly by making available\r\nas co-chairmen of the talks former Prime Minister Harri\r\nHolkeri and General John de Chastelain. They have\r\nshown unfailing forbearance and unremitting commitment\r\nto this delicate and complex process.\r\nWith this help, and with the resolve of both\r\nGovernments to ensure that an unequivocal ceasefire was\r\na necessary condition for involvement in the talks\r\nprocess, another ceasefire was, as I said earlier,\r\nestablished in July this year. Because the ceasefire has\r\nbeen re-established, all parties to the problem of Northern\r\nIreland have now been invited to join the talks process in\r\nBelfast and to begin the task of shaping our respective\r\ninterwoven futures.\r\nWe have, in the course of the Anglo-Irish peace\r\nprocess, sought to accomplish the purpose for which this\r\nAssembly was established — to replace mistrust and\r\nviolent confrontation with dialogue, negotiation and\r\nagreement between all the parties to conflict. We do not\r\nunderestimate the difficulties that lie ahead. As the\r\nhistory of the United Nations itself has shown, major\r\nconflicts have, for the most part, been avoided.\r\nHowever, the resolution of localized conflicts has\r\nproven elusive and problematic.\r\nThe principles, purpose and practice of this\r\nAssembly and the United Nations itself were formed to\r\nreplace conflict — of whatever scale — with peace\r\nthrough dialogue. In our approach to Northern Ireland,\r\nwe have been guided by the same impulse to create\r\nprinciples, purposes and practices which will replace\r\nthe method and means of sectarian hatred and\r\nintercommunal violence.\r\nWe have made it clear that in our talks, all issues\r\nare on the table, that no outcome is ruled out of bounds\r\nfor discussion or is predetermined. We have constructed\r\na process and rules of procedure by which the parties\r\ncan discuss, refine and eventually agree on the\r\nstructures which will embrace the totality of relations\r\non the two islands and which command the consent of\r\nboth unionists and nationalists in Ireland.\r\nWe have established as an integral part of the\r\ndialogue that we recognize the rights and wishes of the\r\nunionist community in the same way as we insist that\r\nparity of esteem for Nationalists is a necessary and just\r\ncomponent of any eventual settlement.\r\nWe have set out our view that the resolution of the\r\nissue of the decommissioning of arms is an\r\nindispensable part of the process of negotiation. We\r\nhave emphatically declared, in our insistence on\r\nadherence to the Mitchell principles of democracy and\r\nnon-violence, that only those committed to democratic\r\nand exclusively peaceful means of resolving political\r\nissues and those who renounce force or the threat of\r\nforce to influence the outcome of the negotiations can\r\nbe a party to the talks process.\r\nWe have embraced as a founding principle in the\r\ncurrent talks process and its eventual outcome that any\r\nagreement must command sufficient consensus between\r\nboth sets of participants. We have accepted that the\r\nagreement reached will be put to the people of Ireland,\r\nNorth and South, for their approval.\r\nBoth Governments have set a target to conclude\r\nthese talks by next May and present proposals to the\r\npeople of Ireland, North and South, in parallel\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nreferendums. I believe that this target is necessarily\r\nambitious and realistically achievable.\r\nWe may well have setbacks in the interim. We\r\ncertainly have difficult issues to confront and\r\ncompromises to make which will require courage and\r\nvision.\r\nBut both Governments — and I believe the parties\r\ncurrently in the talks process — are collectively\r\ndetermined that this process will be pursued, that there\r\nwill be no going back, and that the future we seek of\r\nharmonious relations and an honourable and\r\ncomprehensive agreement will be secured and that lasting\r\npeace will be brought to our island.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor now to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium, His Excellency\r\nMr. Erik Derycke.\r\nMr. Derycke (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): At the outset, allow me to take this opportunity\r\nto congratulate Minister Udovenko, our colleague from\r\nUkraine, on his election as President of this session of\r\nthe General Assembly and to express my most sincere\r\nthanks to Ambassador Razali of Malaysia for the\r\ninvaluable work he helped us achieve during the fifty-\r\nfirst session of the Assembly.\r\nIt is clear that the way in which we organize\r\nourselves as a world community is of the utmost\r\nimportance for questions of war and peace, poverty and\r\nwealth, and justice and injustice in the world.\r\nThe United Nations Secretariat and the leadership of\r\nour Organization have a key role in this regard. All those\r\nserving United Nations institutions deserve our gratitude\r\nfor the way in which they carry out their work, both here\r\nin New York and in the field, often in precarious\r\nsituations in which some have even lost their lives.\r\nBut we should ask whether we, the Member States,\r\nhave done enough to find common responses. Have we\r\ngiven the United Nations the necessary tools for\r\ncomprehensive management? Have we not blamed the\r\nOrganization for a lack of success in some of its\r\nendeavours, when they may have been doomed to failure\r\nanyway because there was not enough support from\r\nMember States?\r\nWe must be fully aware that, as Member States, we\r\nsometimes try to impose tasks upon the Organization\r\nwhich are beyond its capabilities, while we are all too\r\noften slow to provide help and support whenever and\r\nwherever it is really needed. More than once we have\r\nseen — in Africa, for example — that the United\r\nNations has had to spread itself too thinly over vast\r\ndistances and that adequate support for a United\r\nNations role has not been forthcoming from Member\r\nStates, which has weakened the United Nations ability\r\nto react when a dynamic response was needed in crisis\r\nsituations.\r\nHas not the time come, during this session, to\r\nensure that the Organization can act with renewed\r\nvigour and reconfirm its authority? I am convinced that\r\nthe answer to this question should be positive, and that\r\nwe should, like the President of the European Union\r\nand other previous speakers, throw our full weight\r\nbehind the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals to prepare the\r\nOrganization more effectively for the coming\r\nmillennium.\r\nMore efficiency and coordination, greater cohesion\r\nand better cooperation between Headquarters and\r\nagencies in the field are minimal changes, but fully\r\njustified. However, we need to do more because this\r\nyear we must resolve the United Nations financial\r\ncrisis.\r\nIt is unacceptable that Member States should not\r\npay their dues in full and that they attach conditions to\r\nthe payment of what they owe. All the speakers in the\r\ngeneral debate should be able to proclaim from this\r\nrostrum not just that they want to improve the\r\nOrganization\u0027s efficiency and that they support the\r\nSecretary-General in his efforts to that end, but also\r\nthat their contributions have been paid in full,\r\nunconditionally, thus proving their commitment to the\r\ngoals of the United Nations and our common agenda.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThere can be no doubt that this agenda includes\r\nthe achievements of the 12 United Nations conferences\r\nwhich, from the 1990 World Summit for Children to\r\nthe 1996 World Food Summit, have paved the way for\r\nthe current agenda in the area of international\r\ndevelopment. But responsibilities have often been\r\ndistributed injudiciously and too widely, while mandates\r\nhave proved insufficient. A more integrated approach in\r\nthe social and economic sector has in any case become\r\nnecessary. I therefore welcome the fact that the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals for reform pay particular\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nattention to development, and I subscribe fully to his\r\nproposals.\r\nFurthermore, a well-balanced expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council should be achieved without delay.\r\nBelgium, together with a number of like-minded\r\ncountries that share the general concern with regard to\r\nstrengthening the authority of the Security Council, has\r\nclearly stated its views here in New York. We advocate\r\nan increase in both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers, greater regional representativeness, enhanced\r\nCouncil efficiency and a limitation of the right of veto.\r\nThe right of veto is incompatible with the general\r\ninterest. It should be possible to modify the\r\ndecision-making mechanism so as to avoid recourse to\r\nthis instrument, which has become entirely obsolete.\r\nBelgium also pleads for more transparency and closer\r\ncooperation between the Security Council and countries\r\ncontributing to peacekeeping operations.\r\nSuch organizational and financial reform can\r\nsucceed only if it can rely upon a team of officials who\r\nsee themselves as being at the service of the Organization\r\nand of the common good. Ultimately, an Organization\r\nreformed along these lines and better able to meet global\r\nchallenges will have to strengthen its ties with and\r\ncomplement regional organizations, not only in the\r\npolitical field but also at the social and economic level. It\r\nwill not be possible to make our world more humane\r\nwithout the joint effort of all international organizations\r\nin support of a global approach. In this effort, the United\r\nNations, together with regional and specialized\r\ninstitutions, is a beacon of hope for millions of people.\r\nStrengthening the United Nations also means\r\nstrengthening its ties with other organizations and\r\nassociations so that they can keep pace with the overall\r\nreshaping of our Organization and of our world vision.\r\nI should like to provide two examples. With regard\r\nto its policy on Africa, Belgium again stresses the need\r\nfor an objective approach on the one hand and\r\naccountability on the other. The approach that we wish to\r\npromote is based on universal principles, the most\r\nimportant of which is that of human rights sustained by\r\nmutual respect based on equality. It is high time that we\r\nprogressed to true mental decolonization. Efforts\r\noriginating in the region itself should be given every\r\nchance to prosper and should be fully recognized by the\r\ninternational community. As for Central Africa in\r\nparticular, our common efforts should give priority to the\r\nreconstruction and democratization of the Congo, in the\r\ninterests not only of that country and its people, but of\r\nstability in the Great Lakes region as a whole.\r\nOn the other hand, in certain areas, such as\r\nEastern Slavonia, United Nations “blue helmets” have\r\nsucceeded in separating warring parties, protecting\r\npopulations and preparing for reconstruction. It is\r\ntherefore the responsibility first of the parties\r\nthemselves and then of the international community to\r\nmake every effort to prevent these achievements from\r\nslipping away. By extension, this is also true for the\r\nregion as a whole. With regard to Eastern Slavonia in\r\nparticular, it is important for the activities of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to\r\nbe based on the accomplishments of the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\r\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and for such\r\nactivities to be inspired by and based upon United\r\nNations experience in the region.\r\nI should now like to focus on another\r\ncontemporary issue: disarmament. Needless to say,\r\nweapons of mass destruction should be forbidden. But\r\nthis is also true for weapons whose sole purpose is to\r\ndestroy human beings, such as anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. In Angola, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cambodia\r\nand elsewhere, these indiscriminate and cowardly\r\nweapons kill some 9,600 people and maim another\r\n14,000 every year. They kill and mutilate more people\r\nthan all the weapons of mass destruction put together.\r\nIt is high time that these devices were banned. In\r\nless than two years the objective of a total ban on\r\nanti-personnel landmines has met with a positive\r\nresponse in most parts of the world. Belgium, which\r\nwas keen to play a leading role in this field, fully\r\nsupports this objective. As chairman of the international\r\nconference on a total ban on anti-personnel landmines,\r\nwhich took place in Brussels in June, I myself noted\r\nthe existence of the political will necessary to achieve a\r\nban by the end of 1997.\r\nThe recent conclusion in Oslo of the negotiations\r\non a legally binding instrument means that most of us\r\nwill be able to go to Ottawa in early December to sign\r\nthis important treaty. My country made a great effort to\r\nensure that we produced a strong legal instrument, with\r\nno exceptions or reservations, and we also advocated\r\nthat assistance to landmine victims should be an\r\nessential part of this convention. Belgium is pleased to\r\nnote that this international humanitarian standard will\r\nsoon become a reality and invites all other States to\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\njoin in the effort. It is also my firm hope that States will\r\nnot wait for the treaty to come into force before they\r\nhonour this total ban.\r\nHumanitarian tragedies will continue to occur\r\nthroughout the world. Whatever their origins, crises are\r\nbecome increasingly complicated. Still considerable in\r\nnumber, they create countless victims and immense\r\nhuman suffering. Despite greater solidarity and increased\r\nhumanitarian assistance granted by a growing number of\r\nhumanitarian and non-governmental organizations,\r\ndifficulties on the ground have continued to grow in\r\nrecent years. Above all, in addition to the problem of\r\naccess to victims, the lack of security and total disregard\r\nfor international humanitarian law and human rights\r\nrequire our particular attention. Indeed, I am especially\r\nworried about the recent increase in aggression against\r\nhumanitarian personnel. These acts are often carried out\r\nwith the sole purpose of blocking their access to\r\npopulations who are suffering. It goes without saying that\r\nthe authorities hosting the humanitarian workers bear\r\nprimary responsibility for their safety.\r\nThese authorities must also ensure respect for\r\nhumanitarian law, based on values for which a consensus\r\nexists within the international community but whose\r\nconcrete application on the ground remains a daily\r\nchallenge. This is another task for the United Nations.\r\nExisting legal instruments must be strengthened and\r\nexpanded in order to extend the same maximum\r\nprotection to humanitarian personnel in the field as is\r\ncurrently provided for military personnel in peacekeeping\r\nmissions. In addition, the directives on humanitarian law\r\nsuch as those proposed by the International Committee of\r\nthe Red Cross should also be revitalized and thoroughly\r\nexamined.\r\nOur Organization is increasingly confronted with\r\ncrises that require global responses comprising not only\r\ntheir humanitarian dimensions, but also their military,\r\neconomic, political and social dimensions. In these\r\ncircumstances, humanitarian organizations must not only\r\ncontinue to ensure a thorough coordination of the\r\nassistance delivered, but also develop stepped-up\r\nconvergence between, for instance, United Nations Blue\r\nHelmets involved in peacekeeping missions and\r\nhumanitarian workers.\r\nGreater interaction and cooperation between them is\r\nimperative if we wish to devise an integrated and suitable\r\nresponse to the ever more complex crisis situations facing\r\nthe international community.\r\nI believe that much remains to be done in order to\r\nimprove and develop such cooperation: for example,\r\njoint planning for crisis situations, training, defining\r\nroles and mandates and, finally, implementation and\r\nfollow-up of operations.\r\nWe must bear in mind that humanitarian assistance\r\nmust never be used for mere political purposes, and it\r\ncannot by itself be intended to provide a lasting\r\nsolution to a conflict. Humanitarian assistance should\r\ntherefore never be a substitute for political, diplomatic\r\nand military action.\r\nIn this context, Belgium, in close cooperation with\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, intends\r\nto organize next year, an international seminar precisely\r\non the relationship between humanitarian, political and\r\nmilitary actions. The focus will be on interaction\r\nbetween humanitarian, political and military actors in\r\nsituations of crisis. This will be an opportunity to\r\nanalyse closely the often widely varying approaches to\r\nthis problem.\r\nThe objective of international humanitarian\r\nassistance is not only to guarantee the survival of\r\nvictims of humanitarian tragedies. It should also help\r\nthem be reintegrated into society. Viewed in this\r\nfashion, humanitarian assistance is an important factor\r\nin the protection of human dignity, human rights and\r\nhumanitarian law. The international community must\r\ntherefore put an end to the impunity of persons\r\nresponsible for grave violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law, whether committed against\r\npopulations or humanitarian personnel.\r\nThe creation of the ad hoc tribunals for the\r\nprosecution and punishment of such violations and the\r\nnecessary creation of a standing international criminal\r\ncourt, are important steps towards the fulfilment of\r\nthese goals.\r\nHowever, it is essential that these international\r\njudiciary bodies should be given a fair chance to carry\r\nout their functions. Thus, their legal competence should\r\nbe firmly established and recognized by all Member\r\nStates.\r\nRespect for human rights has become an essential\r\nyardstick of the legitimacy of the exercise of State\r\npower and is increasingly considered a vital part of a\r\ncountry’s international status and influence. It has\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\nbecome the new basis for the confidence we bestow on\r\nour fellow Member States.\r\nNext year the General Assembly will devote part of\r\nits session to the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights.\r\nThat Declaration, without any doubt, is one of the\r\nmost important texts of our times. It is the foundation of\r\nthe whole array of standards that came after it and that\r\nhave been incorporated into a number of international\r\nlegal instruments. It is also the bedrock upon which rest\r\nall United Nations activities aimed at better respect for\r\nand promotion of human rights, in accordance with the\r\nCharter.\r\nIn the spirit of the Vienna World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, a growing number of Member States, in\r\nfull exercise of their sovereignty, have accepted\r\ninternational commitments by ratifying those human\r\nrights instruments. However, I should like to express the\r\nhope that Member States will also spare no effort in\r\nhaving their provisions implemented. By so doing they\r\nwill contribute to the universality of human rights.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains\r\nan inexhaustible source of hope for all those who are\r\ndeprived of their rights, especially the victims of social,\r\npolitical or economic exclusion or exploitation on the\r\nbasis of their race, origin, religion, sex or any other\r\ngrounds.\r\nConsequently, I, fully subscribe to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s stated intention to integrate human rights\r\nhorizontally throughout the full range of United Nations\r\nactivities. Belgium reiterates to the Secretary-General its\r\nfull support in this respect.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that my country will\r\nmake every effort — nationally, regionally and\r\nglobally — so that the commemoration of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights will be a resounding\r\nsuccess that reflects the capital importance of the event.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the\r\nfirst intervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Samadi (Islamic Republic of Iran): This\r\nmorning unacceptable claims were made by the Foreign\r\nMinister of the United Arab Emirates against the\r\nterritorial integrity of my country, claims that have no\r\nbasis in history or international law.My delegation has\r\nmade its position in this regard very clear on previous\r\noccasions.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is fully committed to\r\nits international obligations, especially those arising\r\nfrom the agreement of 1961.\r\nWe firmly believe that misunderstandings over the\r\ninterpretation or application of that agreement, if any,\r\nshould be addressed with goodwill and through\r\nmutually agreed mechanisms in order to find a friendly\r\nsolution.\r\nMy Government remains prepared to take up the\r\nmisunderstandings over the island of Abu Musa directly\r\nwith officials of the United Arab Emirates and stands\r\nready to enter into negotiations without preconditions.\r\nAs the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran reiterated in his statement before the Assembly\r\nthree days ago, our message to our neighbours is one of\r\nfriendship and fraternity, and we shall warmly welcome\r\nany initiative to strengthen the foundations of\r\nconfidence and cooperation in the Persian Gulf.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nSince this is the first time my delegation has spoken in\r\nthe Assembly at this session, allow me to express our\r\nwarm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to\r\npreside over this session.\r\nThe Spanish delegation feels obliged to speak in\r\nexercise of its right of reply to refer to the mention of\r\nthe Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla in the statement\r\nmade this afternoon by the Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco. Such mention is not in keeping with the facts,\r\nsince those cities are Spanish territories whose citizens\r\nare represented in the Spanish Parliament with the same\r\nrights and the same status as the rest of their\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 25 September 1997\r\ncompatriots, and there is no possible parallel with other\r\nsituations that are totally different in nature.\r\nIn addition, such references are not in keeping with\r\nthe overall relationship that exists between the Kingdoms\r\nof Spain and Morocco, both bilaterally and within the\r\nbroader region to which we both belong, as neighbours.\r\nMr. Otuyelu (Nigeria): My delegation would like to\r\nspeak in exercise of its right of reply with reference to\r\nthe statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Ireland, in which he said that the human\r\nrights situation in Nigeria was an issue of great concern\r\nto his Group. We understand that the perception of the\r\nsituation in Nigeria will be based on the cultural and\r\nhistorical background of the observer.\r\nThe situation in Nigeria is that at present all the\r\nlocal government areas — more than 700 — are under\r\ndemocratically elected officials. The operation of the\r\nNational Human Rights Commission, which is\r\nindependent of the Government, is living evidence of the\r\ncommitment of the present Administration to the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights.\r\nWhat Nigeria needs now is not expressions of\r\nconcern about its capacity to pursue the programmes it\r\nhas set for itself, but the understanding and the support\r\nof our friends; expressions of concern should not\r\nbecome primary.\r\nWe should like to state that the Administration is\r\ncommitted to democratization. The first phase has been\r\ncompleted, and the second and third phases are on\r\ncourse. The promotion of human rights is a priority of\r\nthe present Administration.\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): My colleague the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran referred\r\nto the statement by the Foreign Minister of the United\r\nArab Emirates this morning on the question of the\r\nIranian occupation of the three islands of the United\r\nArab Emirates — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu\r\nMusa. I should advise my colleague that when taking\r\nup historical, legal and political issues with relation to\r\nthose three islands he should examine the records of the\r\nSecurity Council since the beginning of that occupation\r\nin 1971.\r\nThat being said, however, I draw attention to the\r\nnew trends towards a peaceful settlement of this issue\r\non the basis of confidence-building and good-\r\nneighbourliness, and proceeding from our persistent\r\nconcern to have friendly relations with the friendly\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran and the countries of the Gulf\r\nCorporation Council, especially since we believe that\r\nconflicts must not be resolved in the contexts of the use\r\nof force, but rather in accordance with the international\r\nnorms enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the\r\nrules of international law. In view of all that, the\r\nstatement by the Foreign Minister of the United Arab\r\nEmirates contained nothing counter to international law\r\nor international legality. We are invoking our legitimate\r\nrights, yet as we speak here in this forum, friendly Iran\r\nis still occupying part of the territory of the United\r\nArab Emirates.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.\r\n33\r\n"
