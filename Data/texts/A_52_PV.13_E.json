(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State\r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe President: This morning the Assembly will first\r\nhear an address by the Head of State of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nHead of State of the Kingdom of Swaziland, His Majesty\r\nKing Mswati III, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nKing Mswati III: I bring with me from the Kingdom\r\nof Swaziland the warm greetings and best wishes of Her\r\nMajesty the Indlovukazi, the Government and the whole\r\nSwazi nation, to our friends and fellow Member States here\r\nat the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland, may I\r\ncongratulate you most sincerely, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\r\nsession. We are confident that the wisdom, experience and\r\ndiplomatic skills that you bring to the office will ensure\r\nsuccess in the many issues facing this session.\r\nSwaziland would also like to commend the work of\r\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, who\r\npresided with such skill over the deliberations of the fifty-\r\nfirst session.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would like to place on\r\nrecord its deep appreciation for the work of Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali during his tenure as our Secretary-General.\r\nMuch was achieved during the five years of Mr. Boutros-\r\nGhali’s leadership, and the whole world owes him a huge\r\ndebt of gratitude.\r\nWe would like further to welcome our new\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has shown in his\r\nfirst year that he has the vision and qualities effectively\r\nto lead our Organization into the twenty-first century. All\r\nof us in Africa are proud of what he has achieved in such\r\na short time.\r\nOne of the main challenges facing our Secretary-\r\nGeneral is the reform of the United Nations into a cost-\r\neffective, accountable, credible, well-managed and fully\r\nrepresentative Organization.\r\nSwaziland gave its full support to the initial Track 1\r\nproposals put forward by the Secretary-General. In\r\nparticular, we supported the various initiatives designed\r\nto reduce administrative costs in favour of increased\r\nefficiency in the development programmes in the field.\r\nWe trust that the welfare of those affected by the\r\nnecessary cuts has been carefully considered.\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nWe have also welcomed the Track 2 reforms,\r\nannounced in July, and again, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals on economic and social reform,\r\ndevelopment cooperation, humanitarian relief and human\r\nrights.\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General’s address at the\r\nfirst meeting of the general debate struck exactly the right\r\nnote of wise optimism. The responsibility now lies with the\r\nGeneral Assembly to support the Secretary-General’s bold\r\napproach, and the Kingdom of Swaziland urges its fellow\r\nMember States to back the proposals and allow the reforms\r\nto forge ahead.\r\nOne area of reform that will have a major impact on\r\nthe openness and accountability of the United Nations\r\ndecision-making process is the question of the membership\r\nand expansion of the Security Council, in particular the\r\nneed for greater representation of the developing world\r\namong the permanent members.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland fully supports the updated\r\nAfrican Common Position, which calls for, among other\r\nthings, membership in the Security Council to be based on\r\nan equal geographical formula, on a regional or continental\r\nbasis. This would make the Council more democratic and\r\nensure that all Members would feel fairly and equally\r\nrepresented in our Organization’s most influential body.\r\nAfrica believes that the continent should have at least\r\ntwo permanent seats, with full voting and veto rights, to\r\nrepresent the views and concerns of the other 51 countries.\r\nThese two permanent seats would be appointed through the\r\nmechanism designed by the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU), following the established traditional practice in\r\nforce.\r\nAt the heart of the debate on overall United Nations\r\nreform is the question of finances. Most of the reforms\r\ninitiated by the Secretary-General are aimed at making the\r\nOrganization more cost-efficient and accountable and at\r\nallowing more of our finances to be available for the\r\nprogrammes in the field. This is a timely and necessary\r\ninitiative and is deserving of the strongest support of all\r\nMember States.\r\nThese reforms also justify the recommitment of all\r\nMember States to keep up to date with their dues. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland has consistently tried to maintain a\r\ngood record in fulfilling its financial obligations to the\r\nUnited Nations. We pledge to do our best to continue to\r\nkeep up to date, and we would urge all our fellow Member\r\nStates to show similar confidence in, and support for, our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would also like to add\r\nits voice to the appreciation expressed to Mr. Ted Turner\r\nfor his extraordinary display of confidence in our\r\nOrganization. His act of generosity, from the private\r\nsector, reflects a new spirit of optimism in the United\r\nNations, and we would call on others with the resources\r\nto do so to follow Mr. Turner’s example.\r\nHopes for future global stability have been raised by\r\nthe various initiatives for reducing the numbers and\r\nspread of nuclear weapons and warheads.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland in particular commends\r\nthe commitment of the United States of America and of\r\nRussia to the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START)\r\nprogrammes, whose implementation will contribute\r\nsignificantly to a more peaceful world for future\r\ngenerations.\r\nWe are also encouraged by the global support for the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and for the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention, both of which have been\r\nsigned by the Kingdom of Eswatini.\r\nAll these initiatives are important indications of the\r\nreal commitment of almost all countries to promote\r\ninternational peace and security. We fully support the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to create a new Department\r\non Disarmament and Arms Regulation as a necessary\r\naddition to the Organization.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support all\r\nmoves to bring about a total ban on the production, use\r\nand sale of all types of landmines. We participated at the\r\nrecent Oslo negotiations on anti-personnel landmines and\r\nwelcomed the signing of the treaty.\r\nWe regret, however, that not all countries could be\r\nparties to the treaty, while understanding the reasons\r\nbehind their decisions. We sincerely hope that a way can\r\nbe found soon to achieve universal agreement on this\r\ncrucial humanitarian issue.\r\nAs a consequence of situations of instability on our\r\nborders, we have experienced first hand the terror of\r\nlandmines, and we have great sympathy for all who have\r\nundergone the suffering associated with them. We also\r\nwatched with great admiration the efforts of the late\r\nDiana, Princess of Wales, to bring to the world an\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nawareness of the horrors of these indiscriminate tools of\r\nwar. We therefore call on all Member States to support the\r\ninitiatives aimed at ending for ever the threat of all types of\r\nlandmines.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland views with great concern\r\nthe situation in the Middle East and in particular the\r\nstrained relations between the Israeli and Palestinian people.\r\nThe climate of reconciliation and hope inspired by the Oslo\r\npeace accord has given way to suspicion and dread. It is\r\nclear that the international community must continue to\r\nsupport the peace initiative as the only way forward and\r\nmake every effort to bring the two sides back to the\r\nnegotiating table on a basis of mutual trust and confidence.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland supports the efforts of all\r\nwho are trying to achieve a breakthrough in this area. We\r\ncall on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority, for the sake of their own people, to find a way\r\nout of this apparent deadlock and return to the spirit of\r\ncompromise which prevailed during the Oslo negotiations,\r\nand which held out the promise of lasting peace.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been encouraged by\r\nthe recent developments in Northern Ireland, with all-party\r\ntalks on the future of that troubled province at last under\r\nway. We commend the determination of the British and\r\nIrish Governments to involve all stakeholders in the\r\nnegotiations, and we call on all involved to make every\r\neffort to ensure that these negotiations lead to lasting peace\r\nand stability.\r\nThe continent of Africa continues to experience\r\nsituations of instability and conflict which have unfortunate\r\neffects on all of us who call it our home. In the past 12\r\nmonths we have seen crises in Sierra Leone, the Congo and\r\nthe Comoros islands, and the continuation of problems in\r\nmany areas and countries such as the Great Lakes region,\r\nthe horn of Africa and Angola.The Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nprays for the many millions caught up in the violence of\r\nthese and other situations of instability on our beloved\r\ncontinent, and continues to support efforts to find peaceful\r\nsolutions.\r\nAt the same time, we welcome a number of\r\nencouraging events on the continent, in countries such as\r\nLiberia, where United Nations efforts towards peace over\r\nthe years contributed significantly to the elections earlier\r\nthis year.We applaud the peaceful nature of that process,\r\nand we hope and pray that lasting, sustainable peace has at\r\nlast come to the Liberian people after so many years of\r\nconflict.\r\nAnd we commend the appointment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of Personal Envoy Mr. James Baker to oversee\r\nthe situation in Western Sahara. We are most encouraged\r\nby developments in this long-running dispute, and we\r\nlook forward to a lasting resolution in the near future.\r\nIn the light of continuing instability on much of our\r\ncontinent, one practical measure undertaken by the whole\r\nAfrican community has been the recent initiatives by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional\r\norganizations, such as the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and our own Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), to become better\r\nprepared to cope with our continent’s crises using the\r\nresources available to maintain peace in our region. One\r\nelement of this has been the training and preparation of\r\nAfrican peacekeeping forces for deployment throughout\r\nthe continent. The Kingdom of Swaziland has pledged its\r\ncommitment to provide troops for such forces, once\r\nadequate training and preparation have been completed.\r\nWe should like to record our appreciation to the\r\nUnited States of America for its African Crisis Response\r\nInitiative, which is focusing a number of African\r\ncountries, including the Kingdom of Swaziland, on the\r\nrequirement for such things as standardized procedures,\r\ntraining and equipment. It is clearly essential for this type\r\nof peace force initiative to have the support of the\r\ninternational community and for the OAU to maintain\r\nclose cooperation with the United Nations in our joint\r\nattempts to provide adequate policing of crisis situations\r\nin Africa.\r\nFor almost 30 years the Kingdom of Swaziland has\r\nenjoyed excellent relations with a nation which, despite an\r\noutstanding record in international development\r\nassistance, and while fulfilling all the requirements for\r\nmembership of our Organization, is nonetheless excluded\r\nfrom participating in the activities of the United Nations.\r\nI am referring to the issue of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan.\r\nIn October 1971 the United Nations adopted a\r\nresolution which withdrew membership from the Republic\r\nof China. That resolution has the effect today of denying\r\nthe rights of almost 22 million people to be represented\r\nhere in the United Nations, and to contribute to all the\r\nglobal initiatives undertaken by our Organization.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been in a position to\r\nrecognize and experience at first hand the peace-loving\r\nnature of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nwillingness to help foster peace and prosperity throughout\r\nthe world. The Government and people of the Republic of\r\nChina have made enormous advances in economic, social\r\nand political terms, and have shown themselves ready and\r\nable to share their experience and advice with all the\r\nnations of the world.\r\nMany countries and political groupings over the years\r\nhave also recognized the need to involve the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan in global development activities, through\r\nthe offices of the United Nations and its agencies. There is\r\nalso a growing voice of international opinion, including in\r\nthe European Parliament, the American Congress and\r\namong many countries on all five continents, that\r\nmembership of the United Nations is necessary for the huge\r\nresources and wealth of expertise of the Republic of China\r\nto be put to the best possible use for the benefit of all\r\nmankind.\r\nOne of the founding and guiding principles of our\r\nOrganization has been that of universality, of granting all\r\npeoples of the world the right to belong to the United\r\nNations and to be heard in our chambers. It is a reality that\r\nalmost 22 million people believe that that right is denied to\r\nthem, by virtue of their country\u0027s exclusion from the\r\nactivities of the one truly global development Organization.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore proposes to its fellow\r\nMember States that the time has now come to review the\r\nresolution of 26 years ago. We believe that there is an\r\nurgent need to re-examine this issue, taking into account the\r\nprofound changes in the situation that have occurred since\r\n1971.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has viewed with concern\r\nthe recent report of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development, which highlighted once more the\r\neconomic plight of the developing world. Globalization and\r\nliberalization are economic principles with which we all\r\nagree, but not at the expense of a greater concentration of\r\nwealth in the developed countries and an increase in\r\npoverty amongst the underdeveloped.\r\nIt is all very well to quote the long-term benefits of\r\ntrade liberalization, but we must understand the severe\r\nshort-term penalties for those countries which are least\r\nprepared to meet them. The Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nunderstands very well what is required of us in a world of\r\nfree trade, in terms of becoming a producer of finished\r\ngoods and services in a manner which will allow us to\r\ncompete effectively and on an equal basis with the rest of\r\nthe world. But for us to achieve the growth and standards\r\nof technology and production required, we and the rest of\r\nthe developing world need the understanding and support\r\nof the developed countries in what will be very difficult\r\neconomic times ahead.\r\nTo meet this economic challenge, the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland is continuing its efforts to develop in a\r\nsustainable manner, and to create an environment in\r\nwhich our people can prosper. We have been following\r\nup recent national initiatives designed to address our\r\nshort- and long-term social and political challenges and to\r\nenhance the right conditions to allow our private sector to\r\ncontinue to be the engine for growth. We have just\r\ncompleted our latest national development strategy, which\r\nwill set out Government priorities for the next 25 years.\r\nOur own internal restructuring programme is continuing,\r\nand Government has begun a series of short-term\r\nmeasures to improve the economy.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is a developing nation\r\nwhich is largely dependent on agriculture for its survival.\r\nIn common with other Member States in our position, we\r\ncontinually find ourselves at the mercy of Mother Nature,\r\nand in particular we are dependent on adequate rainfall.\r\nOur economy is only just recovering from the devastating\r\ndrought of 1991 and 1992, and now we have learned with\r\ngreat dismay that the dreaded El Niño is once more\r\npresent in the Pacific Ocean. If true, this will have the\r\ngravest consequences for all of us in southern Africa. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland has learned the lessons of the last\r\ndrought, and we have begun a programme of dam\r\nconstruction throughout the rural areas. But the threat of\r\na renewed period of reduced rainfall has come much too\r\nsoon, and we hope for the support once more of our\r\nOrganization and our fellow Member States.\r\nIn addition to addressing its economic concerns, the\r\nKingdom of Eswatini has also begun a review of the\r\nnation\u0027s Constitution. In response to the call by the Swazi\r\npeople for a fundamental and far-reaching review of our\r\nexisting Constitution, a Commission has been established\r\nand is in the process of conducting a constitutional\r\neducation programme, reaching even to the most remote\r\nareas of the country.\r\nThis will be followed by a period of submissions\r\nfrom everyone in the Kingdom, after which a constitution,\r\nin accordance with the wishes of the whole nation, will be\r\ndrawn up for national approval.\r\nIt will truly be the people\u0027s constitution, since the\r\nprocess allows the free participation of all Swazis.\r\nNational participation in important matters such as these\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nis a crucial guiding principle of the Swazi people and, over\r\nthe years, has ensured the peace and stability we have\r\nalways enjoyed.\r\nWe have welcomed the encouragement and support for\r\nour constitutional review process from the international\r\ncommunity, including the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme office based in the Kingdom. We are confident\r\nthat, with the involvement of all Swazis, we will produce\r\na document reflecting the wishes of the whole nation, one\r\nthat will serve us well for generations to come.\r\nThere is much vital work to be done in this fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly. The Kingdom of\r\nEswatini believes that our Organization is at a major\r\ncrossroads in terms of its own development. We have the\r\nopportunity now to carry out the correct reforms and ensure\r\nthat our Organization is equipped to face the many global\r\nchallenges that lie ahead in a more efficient, accountable\r\nand open manner. We must choose our steps carefully and\r\nwisely. Those for whom we are responsible — our\r\npeople — look to the United Nations to provide the global\r\ndevelopment leadership that we so desperately need. We\r\ncannot afford to fail them.\r\nOn behalf of Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the\r\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation, it is my proud\r\nduty to reaffirm the commitment of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland to the Charter and principles of the United\r\nNations. May God watch over the Assembly\u0027s deliberations\r\nhere in the coming months and guide it in its decisions.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Head of State of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Mr. Alfred Sant,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Malta\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta.\r\nThe Honourable Mr. Alfred Sant, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta, His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Mr. Alfred Sant, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Sant (Malta): I wish to join other delegations in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I am\r\nsure that, with your vast experience and diplomatic skill,\r\nthis Assembly will be guided towards achieving the goals\r\nto which all peace-loving nations aspire. I also take this\r\noccasion to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Razali\r\nIsmail, for the efficient and energetic manner in which he\r\npresided over the Assembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nAs we approach the dawn of a new millennium, the\r\ninternational community continues to prepare itself for the\r\nnew challenges that the twenty-first century will\r\ninevitably bring. Malta welcomes the commitment of our\r\nevolving United Nations, ably led by Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, to become more responsive to and effective\r\nin meeting these new challenges. Similarly, we share his\r\nperception that the United Nations is at a moment of great\r\nopportunity.\r\nThere should be little doubt that, with the demise of\r\nbloc politics, the way has been opened for a world more\r\nat ease with itself. Tension on a global scale has\r\ndiminished. At the same time, global instability has been\r\nreplaced by regional tensions that have often led to ethnic\r\nand other localized conflicts. In our interdependent world,\r\nthe United Nations has a significant role to play in the\r\npromotion of understanding and cooperation, which are\r\nessential elements for the survival of humankind.\r\nFor its part, Malta is ready to work closely with all\r\nMember States to strengthen our capacity for collective\r\naction in the best interests of the States and peoples of\r\nour countries, particularly in upholding the principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Our commitment to\r\nfundamental rights and the process of democracy is\r\nunwavering.\r\nMalta looks forward to the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court in Rome in 1998. Earlier this\r\nmonth, Malta was honoured to host an international\r\nconference on this initiative, which we strongly support.\r\nOur commitment to the setting up of such a court stems\r\nfrom the fact that this court would be a landmark\r\ndevelopment in the creation of a balanced and effective\r\nsystem aimed at ensuring that international crimes,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nespecially mass violations of basic fundamental human\r\nrights, do not remain unpunished.\r\nWe strongly believe that no country can enjoy peace\r\nand prosperity in the true sense of the word unless\r\nfundamental human rights are respected and unless the\r\nState adopts a democratic system of government. Likewise,\r\nMalta is committed to an international policy that promotes\r\ndisarmament and supports all measures that militate against\r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including\r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Malta fully\r\nsupports current efforts being undertaken to ban the\r\nproduction and use of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nEleven months to the day after a democratic change of\r\nGovernment in Malta, I must take this occasion to affirm\r\nour commitment to peace, to cooperation among all nations\r\nand to the pursuit of economic prosperity in a context of\r\nsocial justice. Placed as it is at the southern rim of Europe\r\nand at the geographic and strategic centre of the\r\nMediterranean, Malta stands by its commitment to the\r\nideals of European integration as well as to those of\r\nMediterranean unity. We believe that both these sets of\r\nideals are of vital importance, while being complementary\r\nand in the best interests of all Mediterranean and all\r\nEuropean peoples.\r\nIn following up on these ideals, we have proposed to\r\nthe Maltese nation a vision of a role for Malta that tangibly\r\naffirms the island\u0027s neutrality, in order to remove once and\r\nfor all any perception that Malta could be of any threat to\r\nany of its neighbours, north or south, west or east. Within\r\nthis context, our vision projects for Malta a role that,\r\nsubject to our clear limitations of size and resources,\r\nactively seeks to help build political, economic, social and\r\ncultural bridges between all our neighbours and other\r\npeoples of the Euro-Mediterranean space.\r\nIndeed, Malta\u0027s foreign policy has three important\r\nconstituents. It is a foreign policy based on cooperation\r\nwith neighbouring countries, free of alignments yet open\r\nand friendly to all; supported by an economic strategy\r\nbased on high-quality production and the provision of high-\r\nquality services; and endeavouring to pursue excellence and\r\nreliability in all that it seeks and undertakes.\r\nMalta\u0027s foreign policy priority is to maintain the best\r\nand most transparent relationship possible with all of our\r\nneighbours in the Euro-Mediterranean region and beyond.\r\nOur active neutrality foreign policy agenda aims to deepen\r\nour ties with the European Union in a meaningful manner\r\nwhile implementing an active Mediterranean policy to\r\nencourage regional cooperation and unity.\r\nIndeed, the Government of Malta aims to forge the\r\nclosest possible relations with the European Union by\r\nnegotiating ties in the form of a free trade area coupled\r\nwith a long-term political and security cooperation\r\nagreement, and cooperation in technical, economic,\r\nfinancial and social affairs.\r\nWe are equally committed to build upon our\r\nMediterranean identity and heritage by seeking to further\r\nspur intra-regional networks of cooperation. Malta\r\nstrongly believes that such cooperation, based on dialogue\r\nand mutual understanding, will contribute to a peaceful\r\nEuro-Mediterranean region where Malta is ready to act as\r\na catalyst to bring together the diverse civilizations of the\r\nMediterranean littoral.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Malta speaks of and promotes\r\nits active neutrality. We seek and promote peace and\r\nstability in a troubled and complex region. Malta presents\r\nno threat of any nature to anyone. At the same time,\r\nMalta extends to all of its neighbours the engagement and\r\ncommitment of an honest broker, an intermediary or\r\nsimply a venue for dialogue and discussion, in the search\r\nfor a solution to the many problems which beset them.\r\nThe Government of Malta is determined to be proactive\r\nin the quest for peace, and, in this context, we are\r\ndetermined to enhance the trust needed to act in the best\r\ninterests of all of our societies.\r\nMalta\u0027s neutrality is indeed validated by our\r\ngeostrategic position in the centre of the Mediterranean,\r\nwhere political uncertainties, socio-economic disparities\r\nand diverse cultural traditions all are contributing to an\r\narea that remains plagued by tension and instability. Far\r\nfrom being ideologically motivated, Malta\u0027s neutrality is\r\ntherefore a direct response to the very specific and unique\r\ngeopolitical factors that currently exist in the surrounding\r\nregion.\r\nThe Government of Malta believes that its strategy\r\nof active, site-specific neutrality enables it effectively to\r\npromote stability and understanding across the Euro-\r\nMediterranean region. Moreover, this status of neutrality\r\nwill continue to serve Malta\u0027s self-interests precisely\r\nbecause it will also serve the best interests of the\r\nEuropean Union member States and of our Mediterranean\r\nneighbours.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nFor Malta, the Mediterranean has been and continues\r\nto be an integral element in our national development\r\nprogramme. Malta\u0027s active participation in international and\r\nregional forums is perhaps best described as an extension\r\nof its cooperative security philosophy.\r\nThe Mediterranean is a microcosm of today\u0027s\r\nmultipolar world. The region epitomizes many of the\r\nproblems associated with the North-South debate. These\r\ninclude maritime safety, maritime pollution, illegal\r\nmigration, terrorism and weapons proliferation. Malta is\r\nparticularly concerned at the ever-widening demographic\r\ngap and the ever-widening economic disparities in the\r\nMediterranean region between the affluent North and the\r\nunderdeveloped South. Poverty, combined with a lack of\r\njob opportunities and deteriorating living conditions, is\r\nfueling extremist tensions throughout the Mediterranean.\r\nMalta lies at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and\r\ntherefore believes it can act as a focal point in the effort\r\nneeded to attract the necessary attention and resources to\r\ntackle security challenges in the region. The Mediterranean\r\nis still dominated by areas of tension and conflict, which\r\nrequire our constant vigilance. Israeli-Palestinian relations,\r\nthe Cyprus question, the situation in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nthe sanctions against Libya, the situation in Algeria and\r\nother issues continue to create political tension, which is\r\nunfortunately escalating and therefore creating a sense of\r\nurgency in the finding of immediate and enduring solutions.\r\nMy Government thus believes that the perceived\r\nthreats to stability and therefore to security in the\r\nMediterranean are more of a political, environmental,\r\neconomic, social and humanitarian nature than of a military\r\none.\r\nAn important dimension of my Government\u0027s foreign\r\npolicy is directed towards the fight against drug-related\r\nmatters: illicit trafficking, money laundering and organized\r\ncrime. As a transit country, Malta could easily be open to\r\ninvolvement in the web woven by drug traffickers.\r\nNevertheless, Malta is more determined than ever to face\r\nup to this challenge, which is threatening the very fabric of\r\nour societies. Malta calls upon the international community\r\nfor support in our efforts to eradicate this social plague.\r\nThe Government of Malta believes that the creation of\r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Mediterranean,\r\nestablished on the basis of arrangements unanimously\r\nagreed to by all the States of the region, would inevitably\r\ncontribute to peace and stability in the Mediterranean. This\r\nfact was acknowledged by the 1995 Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), when the\r\ncreation of such zones was encouraged.\r\nThe ultimate objective of Malta\u0027s Mediterranean\r\npolicy is the transformation of the region into a politically\r\nstable and an economically prosperous, demilitarized and\r\nnuclear-free zone. In this respect, Malta intends to make\r\nmaximum use of its contacts and available diplomatic\r\nrepresentation at the United Nations and in other\r\ninternational forums to promote its political objective of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea as an area of peace and stability.\r\nThrough regular diplomatic interaction with other Member\r\nStates at the United Nations, as well as through a more\r\nactive interchange and collaboration with the Office of the\r\nSecretary-General, Malta intends to keep questions\r\nrelating to the Mediterranean high on the international\r\nagenda.\r\nEarlier this year Malta was host to the second Euro-\r\nMediterranean Conference, at which 27 States from\r\nEurope and the Mediterranean held their second\r\nministerial meeting in as many years to forge a Euro-\r\nMediterranean partnership, an event which in itself has\r\nfar-reaching significance. The Malta Conference reiterated\r\nthat the serious and deep-seated problems of our region\r\nneed to be tackled through a process of dialogue and\r\ncommon action, extending over a period of time and\r\ncovering a whole range of interrelated issues. It is Malta\u0027s\r\nconviction that this process has generated a political\r\ncommitment that will effectively contribute to the removal\r\nof the misperceptions and prejudice that still exist in the\r\nregion.\r\nIn its document on foreign policy published before\r\nMalta\u0027s last general elections, held in October 1996, the\r\nMalta Labour Party stated that for the United Nations to\r\nimprove its credibility and authority, it must improve its\r\nstructure, its administration and its competence. Above\r\nall, it is hoped that this world Organization will develop\r\na more efficient mechanism by which it could implement\r\nand execute its decisions more rapidly and effectively.\r\nThat is why Malta today supports the initiative of\r\nthe Secretary-General in presenting his report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly and congratulates him for what we\r\nconsider to be proposals of an unprecedented and\r\ncomprehensive nature.\r\nThis annual gathering provides the perfect setting for\r\nthe international community to come together and take\r\nstock of the previous 12 months and to identify, as\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nprecisely as possible, the challenges that lie ahead. We\r\nbelieve that three types of trans-national security challenges\r\nrequire our immediate attention. These are the war on\r\ndrugs, environmental degradation and the eradication of\r\npoverty. Unlike the immediately visible effects of war,\r\nthese three challenges cannot always be defined with\r\nsufficient clarity, although they have a potential for\r\ndestruction that is equivalent to that of war. Malta sees each\r\nof these areas as a far-reaching hazard which threatens the\r\nvery fabric of our economic, human and environmental\r\nhabitat, leading to instability and presenting real threats to\r\nour security.\r\nThe first challenge concerns the scourge of illicit drug\r\ntrafficking. Countless human lives are being ruined and\r\nwasted to satisfy the greed of a few. This is an\r\nunacceptable situation. Malta believes that the United\r\nNations system is well placed to coordinate this fight\r\nthrough appropriate and effective measures. We therefore\r\nwelcome the recommendation of the Secretary-General that\r\nthe functions of the Commission on Crime Prevention and\r\nCriminal Justice and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs be\r\nconsolidated into a single commission under arrangements\r\nthat will fully preserve the treaty-based functions entrusted\r\nto the latter.\r\nThe second challenge we are facing on the threshold\r\nof the twenty-first century is the reconciliation of\r\nenvironmental concerns with development needs. The\r\ncommon concerns and mutual interests of the international\r\ncommunity in promoting sustainable development, and at\r\nthe same time protecting our environment, cut across\r\nnational boundaries.\r\nThe problem of the environment is no less relevant to\r\nMediterranean countries. Sound management of Malta\u0027s\r\ncoastal and marine environments is of crucial importance\r\nfor an island State like Malta. The pressures exerted on the\r\nMediterranean environment as a consequence of its being\r\nan important maritime highway and a tourist destination are\r\nof particular concern. We believe that solutions to common\r\nenvironmental problems are best found through an\r\nintegrated regional approach.\r\nMy Government is firmly committed to a proactive\r\nrole in supporting regional initiatives in the Mediterranean\r\nfor the conservation and sustainable management of its\r\nnatural marine habitat. Malta has contributed actively to this\r\nprocess in the past, within the context of the Mediterranean\r\nAction Plan of the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP) and the Barcelona Convention, the most recent\r\ninitiative being the setting up of the Mediterranean\r\nCommission for Sustainable Development. Malta intends\r\nto strengthen its participation in that Commission as well\r\nas to contribute to the fullest extent to the Mediterranean\r\nenvironmental programmes within the context of the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean process.\r\nMalta fully supports the efforts of the Organization\r\nin the promotion of environmental protection and the\r\nsustainable use of the world\u0027s natural resources to ensure\r\na more equitable distribution of wealth, and of an\r\ninternational trade regime free of restrictive or\r\ndiscriminatory practices. Together we must adopt an\r\neffective course of action for the coming years that will\r\ncreate the right balance between the need for human-\r\ncentred and socially just development and the need to\r\nensure the sustainability of our natural environment.\r\nIn the five years since the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, not much,\r\nunfortunately, has been achieved. Last June\u0027s special\r\nsession made an in-depth appraisal of the progress\r\nachieved, defined future priorities and helped to raise the\r\nissue of sustainable development higher on the political\r\nagenda. We acknowledge that all of us — developed and\r\ndeveloping, rich and poor — share a common interest in\r\nthe pursuit and attainment of development, which must be\r\nsustained, equitable and integrated. In the words of the\r\nSecretary-General, development is\r\n“a pillar of peace, a foundation of stability, and a\r\npowerful force for preventive diplomacy and\r\npreventive action”. [Press release ECOSOC/5708]\r\nHowever, our third challenge is what I consider to\r\nbe the most complex. For years, the international\r\ncommunity has been trying to come to grips with the\r\nperennial problem faced by millions and millions of the\r\nworld\u0027s population: poverty. The ever-increasing\r\ndisparities between the haves and the have-nots have\r\nreached alarming proportions. The cold war and East-\r\nWest division have been superseded by a post-cold-war\r\nNorth-South divide. Though many had predicted this\r\ndevelopment and called for a concerted effort to deal with\r\nthe issue, little has been done to try to reverse this trend.\r\nPoverty still reigns supreme. Aggravated poverty, hunger\r\nand malnutrition are a paradox of our times. A fifth of the\r\nworld\u0027s population, or 1.3 billion human beings, live on\r\nincomes of below a dollar a day, and over 50 per cent of\r\nthe world\u0027s population have less than 5 per cent of total\r\nglobal income.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nThe United Nations system is uniquely placed to deal\r\nwith such intolerable and acute problems. This Organization\r\nmust dedicate more attention and more time to coordinating\r\neffective action to alleviate the suffering and the degrading\r\nenvironment in which billions of citizens still live. It is time\r\nto act firmly and unequivocally to halt the aggravation of\r\nthis situation, which is fast becoming a latent source of\r\npolitical instability in the world.\r\nMalta believes that as we enter the new millennium\r\nour Organization must become more relevant; it must\r\nbecome more democratic. Today\u0027s setup reflects the past. In\r\na world where everyone is speaking about democracy, the\r\nright and the use of the veto become anachronistic. Malta\r\nis of the view that the use of the veto should be curtailed\r\nwith a view to its eventual elimination. Malta is not in\r\nfavour of extending the right of veto.\r\nOn the issue of the expansion of the Security Council,\r\nMalta believes that the Charter of the United Nations\r\nconsiders all States to be equal, and therefore it follows that\r\nthough we should have a more representative Security\r\nCouncil that reflects today\u0027s membership of the United\r\nNations, this can easily be achieved by increasing the\r\nnumber of non-permanent seats to the Council.\r\nMy Government has carefully examined the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report on renewing the United Nations, document\r\nA/51/950. We agree on the need for more efficiency and\r\ngreater cost-effectiveness. At the same time, we feel that,\r\nas the Organization is a unique body, its tasks and\r\nsuccesses cannot be measured solely in monetary terms.\r\nHere, I would like to highlight two important areas of\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report. In paragraph 108 it is stated\r\nthat when imposing sanctions the Security Council should\r\ngive more consideration\r\n“to making these sanctions more effective in achieving\r\nthe goal of modifying the behaviour of those targeted,\r\nwhile limiting the collateral damages. There is also a\r\nneed to address the broader humanitarian and\r\neconomic effects of sanctions, as well as objective\r\ncriteria in their application and for their termination”.\r\n[A/51/950]\r\nMalta finds itself in total agreement with this\r\nstatement. While supporting the use of fair sanctions,\r\nimposed appropriately and for the minimum period of time\r\npossible by the United Nations in its task of guaranteeing\r\ninternational peace, we feel that the decision to impose\r\nsanctions, especially those which will ultimately affect the\r\nwhole population of a given country, must be justified\r\nand that they should be imposed only as a last resort.\r\nIn another area referred to by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report, Malta would like to see the Secretariat\u0027s\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs dedicate more time and\r\nattention to the situation in the Mediterranean region. In\r\nthis context, consideration should be given to the\r\nestablishment of a Mediterranean desk within that\r\nDepartment. The creation of such a desk would facilitate\r\ncontacts and the Department would thus assume a more\r\ndirect role in the implementation of the relevant\r\nprovisions of resolutions adopted by the General\r\nAssembly on the strengthening of security and\r\ncooperation in the Mediterranean.\r\nMalta\u0027s contributions in the search for peace, security\r\nand cooperation for the benefit of mankind are well\r\nrecorded in the annals of the history of this Organization.\r\nMalta\u0027s initiatives on the law of the sea and climate\r\nchange and the recent initiative on the new role to be\r\ngiven to the Trusteeship Council are witness to the esteem\r\nand dedication which Malta attaches to its role in this\r\nOrganization.\r\nMalta is a small island State. Notwithstanding this,\r\nwe look upon the United Nations as the forum where\r\ncountries such as ours can express their views and where\r\nthe principle of the equality of States is enshrined and\r\nprotected. For us, this Organization has much significance\r\nand for this reason Malta intends to support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his quest for urgent reform.\r\nThe more efficient and relevant the United Nations\r\nbecomes, the better our interests are served. My\r\nGovernment will continue to give its wholehearted\r\nsupport to the United Nations, its agencies and its\r\nprogrammes. Many of the problems and challenges which\r\nwill face us in the third millennium can be overcome only\r\nthrough the concerted efforts of all Member States and\r\nthrough a better, more efficient and more effective United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMalta for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Alfred Sant, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency Dato\u0027 Seri\r\nAbdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Malaysia): Allow me at the outset, Sir,\r\nto congratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly. We have no\r\ndoubt that under your able stewardship this session will\r\nsuccessfully address the many and complex issues\r\nconfronting the Assembly and the Organization.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, and to say how\r\nproud we Malaysians are of the manner in which he guided\r\nthe work of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.\r\nMalaysia is honoured by the opportunity given him to serve\r\nthis Assembly and is deeply grateful for the support he\r\nreceived from Member States, the Secretariat and other\r\nmembers of the international community in the discharge of\r\nhis duties.\r\nI would also like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who since\r\nassuming office less than nine months ago has swiftly\r\nbegun to energize and revitalize this Organization through\r\nhis proposals for change and reform. We wish him every\r\nsuccess in these efforts, for which we extend our full\r\ncooperation and support.\r\nThe general debate of this Assembly is the only truly\r\nuniversal forum where leaders representing diverse\r\nsovereign countries and their peoples are able to articulate\r\nvery freely their views, without fear or favour. Given the\r\nmonopoly of international information and communication\r\nby vested interests, the value of this Assembly as a forum\r\nfor the free expression of differing views by leaders\r\nrepresenting the sovereign Member States cannot be\r\noverstated. As an annual debate which serves the purpose\r\nof bringing to the attention of the international community\r\nthe priority issues of concern to sovereign Member States,\r\nit cannot be replaced.\r\nToday, I am privileged to have the benefit of this\r\nforum to share with Members the priority issues of concern\r\nto Malaysia. Let me begin with a matter of immediate\r\nconcern to us and to a number of other Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, which\r\nexperienced the severe effects of the turmoil in currency\r\nand stock markets in recent weeks. Stock prices plunged\r\nwhile our national currencies depreciated, exacting a heavy\r\ntoll on economic growth and development. The sequence of\r\nevents did not take place as a result of war, conflict, natural\r\ndisaster or mismanagement. It was precipitated by\r\ncurrency speculators - indeed, manipulators - who, driven\r\nby sheer greed, took advantage of the vulnerabilities of\r\ndeveloping economies, especially the fragility of their\r\nnascent financial markets.\r\nWhat happened in South-East Asia could, of course,\r\noccur in other parts of the world which are increasingly\r\ndependent on capital flows for economic growth. Such\r\nrampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the\r\ncurrency and equity markets of developing countries, at\r\na time when they are still feeling their way in a world of\r\nfierce global competition, would trigger off a defensive\r\nreflex on the part of the affected countries, thereby\r\narousing anti-liberalization, which would be detrimental\r\nto free trade.\r\nIn an interdependent world, the currency crisis in\r\nSouth-East Asia warrants the prompt action of the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions, such as the World Bank\r\nand the International Monetary Fund, and the developed\r\ncountries, which should assist the affected economies of\r\nEast Asia in overcoming the effects of this excessive\r\nmanipulation and in preventing its recurrence. Their\r\npositive response in this regard is especially important in\r\norder to maintain the developed countries’ continued\r\ncommitment to, and confidence in, globalization, on\r\nwhich so much of international free trade depends.\r\nThreats to the well-being of States take many forms\r\nand can come from within as well as from outside. These\r\nthreats, including the notion of erosion of sovereignty,\r\nhave been facilitated by the advent of technology. The\r\nSecretary-General alluded to this development in his\r\nreport on the work of this Organization, where he\r\nrecognized that the same technological means that foster\r\nglobalization and the transnational expansion of civil\r\nsociety also provide the infrastructure for expanding\r\nglobal networks of “uncivil society” - organized crime,\r\ndrug-traffickers, money-launderers and terrorists.\r\nWe live in a time when it has become fashionable,\r\nin some quarters, to distinguish between the security of a\r\nState and individual security, especially in the context of\r\ndeveloping regions of the world. The perception has been\r\ncreated that the concept of security of the State is\r\nsomehow inimical to the rights of the individual in the\r\ndeveloping world, and this has been highlighted in the\r\ncontext of human rights. The elevation of the importance\r\nof human rights in the international agenda, a most\r\nwelcome development, has been exploited and politicized\r\nfor narrow self-serving interests and specific political\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nagendas. If our interest is to heap scorn and to indulge in\r\ndouble standards, selectivity and mutual recrimination, the\r\nnoble cause of promoting the universal value of human\r\nrights is bound to suffer. Blatant violations of human\r\nrights — whether in Bosnia and Herzegovina, occupied\r\nterritories of the Arabs and Palestinians or in other parts of\r\nthe world — must be condemned and prevented, and not\r\nhave a blind eye turned to them, if the United Nations is to\r\nplay an effective role in promoting and protecting these\r\nrights.\r\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in 1998,\r\nconsideration needs to be given to a review of relevant\r\nhuman rights documents and their applications. We must\r\nrededicate ourselves to the need for a balanced approach to\r\nall aspects of human rights — civil, political, social,\r\neconomic and cultural. Selective interpretation or\r\napplication of human rights will not only demean their\r\nvalue but, more seriously, undermine the well-being of\r\nindividuals in parts of the world that are still engulfed by\r\nage-old hatreds and animosities. We should reiterate our\r\nrecognition of cultural peculiarities, which is an inherent\r\nand timeless characteristic of human society. We should\r\nassert that there is no intrinsic contradiction between the\r\nrights of the individual and those of the community.\r\nIndividual rights do not exist in a vacuum. Indeed,\r\nindividual and community rights are not mutually exclusive;\r\nthey thrive on the basis of a mutually reinforcing and\r\nbalanced relationship. As one reinforces the other, there\r\nshould be no artificial separation between the two by\r\nstressing the importance of one at the expense of the other.\r\nMalaysia welcomes the appointment of Mrs. Mary\r\nRobinson, former President of Ireland, as the new High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, and hopes that, together\r\nwith the United Nations Secretary-General, she will be able\r\nto improve the United Nations human rights machinery and\r\nrole, including the depoliticization of human rights and the\r\ntimely and full implementation of the right to development.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe United Nations remains, as the Secretary-General\r\nhas put it,\r\n“the only institution that has the breadth of mandate to\r\naddress the root causes of instability and conflict and\r\nto pursue in a comprehensive and integrated manner\r\nthe wide array of economic, social and environmental\r\nissues impinging on development.” (A/51/950, para.\r\n128)\r\nWe must therefore be wary of those seeking to exploit\r\nspecific issues designed to marginalize the Organization.\r\nMore than 50 years after its creation, the pre-eminence of\r\nthe United Nations in multilateral issues can no longer be\r\ntaken for granted, despite its universal membership and\r\nbroad mandates dealing with all issues of peace, security,\r\ndisarmament and development.\r\nThe commitment of the United Nations to\r\ndevelopment remains its most significant role. While the\r\nOrganization’s forays into peacekeeping make all the\r\nheadlines, it is its work in development, in terms of\r\nresources generated and the changes made in peoples’\r\nlives, that is most vital and meaningful to Member States.\r\nIt has become clear that while the eradication of poverty\r\nand the enhancement of development are the\r\nresponsibilities of individual States, the United Nations\r\nsystem has a key conceptual and promotional role to play.\r\nThe ultimate objective — to secure the development\r\nof developing countries — remains the same. We need to\r\nconstantly re-examine the means by which to attain this\r\ngoal. The United Nations must strongly project the need\r\nfor higher levels of growth, accelerated development, and\r\nequitable geographical distribution of growth. In this\r\ncontext, we need to ensure that our approach to\r\ndevelopment takes into account the economic, political\r\nand technological realities of our time, especially the\r\nincreasing influence of the private sector.\r\nRegrettably, resources made available for\r\ndevelopment have declined substantially in recent years,\r\nadversely affecting the various United Nations\r\nprogrammes and agencies concerned. Culpability must\r\nrest with those who had promised to assist but failed to\r\ndeliver. In the light of such a disappointing let-down, the\r\nUnited Nations should explore the possibilities for closer\r\ncooperation with other stakeholders, particularly the\r\ncorporate sectors.\r\nWith their vast resources, expertise, financial clout\r\nand extensive global networking, those in the private\r\nsector should be welcomed as partners to operationalize\r\ncertain aspects of sustainable development. They could,\r\nfor example, provide assistance on environmentally sound\r\ntechnologies where Governments have left a void. The\r\nUnited Nations should ensure that it involves the private\r\nsector from all over the world. However, it must also\r\nensure that it will not be dominated by the interests of the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nbusiness community, by holding the corporate actors\r\naccountable.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to be a democratic\r\ninstitution, accountable to all its Members. Unfortunately,\r\nthis cornerstone of the Organization continues to be assailed\r\nby those still bent on the quest for geopolitical dominance.\r\nIn an increasingly unipolar world it is imperative that the\r\nUnited Nations preserve its independence or autonomy and\r\ndecide in the interests of all Member States, not just those\r\nof a particular Member State or group of States.\r\nThe process of the democratization of the United\r\nNations is particularly important in the context of the\r\nreform of the Organization, especially that of the Security\r\nCouncil, which is long overdue. Malaysia supports an early\r\nresolution of the issue. Ambassador Razali Ismail, in his\r\ncapacity as President of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly and as Chairman of the high-level working group\r\non the reform and restructuring of the Security Council,\r\ntried his best to move the process forward.\r\nConcerted efforts must continue to be made to ensure\r\nthat, since the Council’s permanent members cannot be\r\nabolished, its continued existence must reflect current\r\nrealities, in particular the significant role of the developing\r\ncountries in international affairs. At the same time, as a\r\nmatter of principle, there should be no discrimination or\r\ndifferentiation between the old and the new permanent\r\nmembers. If reform of the Council is to be truly\r\ncomprehensive and consistent with the spirit and realities of\r\nour time, then we must seek to remove — or at least, as a\r\nfirst step, restrict — the use of the veto power. Democracy\r\nin the United Nations is a mockery if the voice of the\r\nmajority is rendered meaningless by the narrow interests of\r\na dominant few.\r\nMalaysia believes that genuine global peace and\r\nsecurity and the survival of mankind can only be assured in\r\na world free of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore,\r\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, remains a\r\nforemost priority of the global community, and we urge the\r\nSecretary-General to reaffirm his support —\r\nnotwithstanding his preoccupation with certain aspects of\r\nproliferation issues, particularly small arms.\r\nWe are deeply concerned over the trend in some\r\nquarters to ignore the need to stop vertical proliferation. We\r\nurge the international community to expedite efforts to\r\nachieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons, to be\r\nformalized in a nuclear weapons convention. We hope that\r\nthe new and reconstituted Department of Disarmament and\r\nArms Regulation will place as high a priority on\r\ndisarmament as it does on proliferation of weapons and\r\narms regulation. For its part, like a number of other\r\nregional groups, has positively contributed to the\r\ndisarmament process by bringing into force the South-\r\nEast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which still awaits\r\nthe support of the nuclear-weapon States.\r\nWhile we stress the importance of non-proliferation,\r\nreal progress in disarmament will only be achieved by\r\naddressing the issue in all its aspects. While nations that\r\naspire to become nuclear Powers should disavow their\r\nintentions, the declared nuclear Powers, which are also\r\nthe world’s largest arms traders, should also embark on\r\nthe road towards general and complete disarmament. In\r\nthis regard, we laud the global initiative to ban landmines,\r\nand call on the producers of these mines to help defray\r\ndemining and rehabilitation costs in the affected countries.\r\nInternational peace and security continues to be\r\nthreatened by the deteriorating situation in the Middle\r\nEast following the waning of the peace initiative in the\r\nMiddle East. Mutual distrust has replaced the synergy for\r\npeace as the modus operandi between Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority. Malaysia supports the call for the\r\nimmediate resumption of peace talks and affirms its\r\nsupport for the Palestinian people and their inalienable\r\nright to self-determination.\r\nWe urge the international community to persuade or\r\npressure Israel to honour its part of the Oslo accords by\r\nlifting the ban on Palestinian cities and towns, and to give\r\nup its intention to build settlements in what are occupied\r\nterritories. We are further alarmed by Israel’s decision to\r\nbuild a dam in the occupied Golan Heights. We view this\r\nas a deliberate act of provocation and bad faith, and\r\nquestion its sincerity in seeking genuine and enduring\r\npeace with its Arab neighbours.\r\nIn the meantime, the international community should\r\ncontinue to provide the necessary financial support to\r\nameliorate the plight of the Palestinians — for example,\r\nthrough the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), to which\r\nmy Government has made its modest contribution over\r\nthe years, in addition to our own bilateral assistance to\r\nPalestine. It is important that UNWRA be provided with\r\nadequate resources to fully implement its programmes and\r\nactivities.\r\nWe remain seriously concerned over the situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Obstacles continue to impede\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nthe full implementation of the Dayton peace accord.\r\nFurther, mutual mistrust and animosity among the different\r\nethnic groups cast doubts over the future of the country. It\r\nis our fear that the withdrawal of the international forces\r\nfrom that country could trigger a new wave of violence and\r\nbloodshed. This fear is real, particularly since indicted war\r\ncriminals, who should have been removed from the scene\r\nlong ago, are still at large and exercising power and\r\ninfluence.\r\nMalaysia believes that creating an environment of trust\r\nand understanding among the peoples of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina is a priority. The international community\r\nshould make efforts to promote goodwill among the\r\nBosnians and encourage them to live in peace and harmony.\r\nOne such initiative could take the form of informal round-\r\ntable conferences, participated in by Bosnians of all ethnic\r\norigins, representing the different sectors of society and\r\nprofessions, including academia, and participants from other\r\ncountries, to discuss all issues of ethnic relations with the\r\nview to enhancing understanding and cooperation among\r\nthem.\r\nIt is my hope that from this effort will emerge a\r\nsizeable group of leaders from various professions, acting\r\nas catalysts for the promotion of goodwill and cooperation\r\namong the ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMalaysia is prepared to work with like-minded countries to\r\nhelp realize this idea. We have to ensure that peace and\r\nstability endure in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that we\r\ncontribute in the efforts towards its early reconstruction. At\r\nthe same time, we must all work to bring justice back to\r\nthe Balkan region by ensuring that just retribution is meted\r\nout to those who participated in some of the worst atrocities\r\nof this century.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, our energies\r\nand preoccupation must centre on building and\r\nstrengthening peace and prosperity. Peace and security are\r\ntwo sides of the same coin: peace nurtures prosperity, while\r\nprosperity reinforces peace. Peace at the national level is\r\nsustained through democracy, good governance and close\r\ncollaboration between the different segments of society.\r\nMalaysia, a multiracial and multi-religious society,\r\nwhich less than a month ago observed its fortieth\r\nanniversary, has been blessed with peace and prosperity.\r\nWhile this may partly be due to fortuitous circumstances,\r\na lot of it has to do with an effective leadership and a\r\npeople determined to improve their lot. It is fortunate that\r\nwe have been able to rule the country by the process of the\r\nballot and not the bullet, with regular free and fair elections\r\nand with the different races accommodating and sharing\r\npower on the basis of democratic principles.\r\nBy engendering social and racial harmony based on\r\na political compact, we have been spared many of the\r\ntraumas experienced by less fortunate countries and we\r\nwere thus able to achieve our development goals in\r\nrelative peace and tranquillity. I am happy to say that we\r\nhave been able to share some of our experience in nation-\r\nbuilding with a number of our friends in the developing\r\nworld.\r\nIn spite of the many criticisms levelled at the United\r\nNations — some of them not entirely justified — this\r\nmuch maligned Organization of ours has remained\r\nsteadfast in its mission to serve the international\r\ncommunity, even as its resources have been dwindling in\r\nrecent years. Clearly, in an ever-changing world that is\r\ngrowing more complex and increasingly unipolar, the\r\nUnited Nations has served as a pillar of international\r\norder. Serving as the collective conscience of humanity\r\nand the arbiter of its conflicts, the Organization, despite\r\nits deficiencies, has functioned as an indispensable norm-\r\nmaking and institution-creating instrument of international\r\nrelations.\r\nIn my view the process of United Nations bashing\r\nhas gone on far too long. While the introspection that\r\nfollowed was inevitable and has had a sobering effect on\r\nthe Organization, it is time for us to pick up the pieces\r\nand allow the Organization to get on with its mission. For\r\nthis purpose, the Secretary-General has put forward a\r\ncomprehensive package of reform proposals for which he\r\nmust be given a lot of credit. Obviously, such a wide-\r\nranging package by its very nature cannot please every\r\none of the 185 Members of the Organization. The\r\nSecretary-General has attempted to put together proposals\r\nand strategies that are intended to secure the broadest\r\nsupport from Member States predicated on a slate of\r\nshared common goals.\r\nMalaysia is supportive of the general thrusts of the\r\nSecretary-General’s package of reform proposals. Many\r\nof the highlights of these proposals are indeed interesting\r\nand deserve our serious consideration. We support the\r\nCabinet-style management approach that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is introducing, revolving around the Senior\r\nManagement Group, as well as his proposal to create the\r\npost of Deputy Secretary-General. We hope that the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General will not only assist an already\r\noverburdened Secretary-General in the management of the\r\nSecretariat, but would also have substantive responsibility\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nin overseeing the core area of development which is dear to\r\nthe hearts of developing countries.\r\nMalaysia also welcomes the measures being taken to\r\nincrease and improve coordination between United Nations\r\nHeadquarters and its field operations. We also support the\r\nrationalization of the work of the Organization involving\r\nthe reconstitution or amalgamation of the various\r\ndepartments aimed at consolidating and integrating their\r\nwork so as to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency.\r\nWe trust that in carrying out the reorganization exercise, the\r\nSecretary-General will be guided by the need to ensure that\r\nthe changes will benefit all of the Member States,\r\nparticularly those in the developing world.\r\nMy delegation will take an active part in the detailed\r\ndiscussion of the Secretary-General’s reform proposals in\r\nany format that will be agreed upon by Member States\r\nwhich will facilitate their implementation at an early date.\r\nIn carrying out these reforms, however, we should not lose\r\nsight of the importance of the financial health of the\r\nOrganization, which has been highlighted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself. The proposed revolving credit fund is a\r\nwelcome measure insofar as it provides financial solvency\r\nin the short term. But it is unfair and unethical that the rest\r\nof the world is held to ransom by the few who disregard\r\ninternational treaties and agreements and Charter provisions\r\nfor the sake of their narrow national interests. We join the\r\nSecretary-General in urging Member States to work towards\r\nthe speedy resolution of the financial crisis of the United\r\nNations by fulfilling their financial obligations towards the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Dariusz Rosati, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Poland.\r\nMr. Rosati (Poland): At the outset I would like to\r\noffer my sincere congratulations upon Mr. Udovenko’s\r\nelection to the honourable post of President of the United\r\nNations General Assembly at its fifty-second session. The\r\nPolish delegation expresses its satisfaction that the\r\npresidency of this session has been entrusted to an eminent\r\nstatesman from Ukraine, a country with which we have ties\r\nof friendship and cooperation based on common values and\r\naspirations. The President may count on my delegation’s\r\nfull cooperation in the performance of his important tasks.\r\nPlease also allow me to extend expressions of\r\nappreciation and respect to Mr. Razali Ismail, a prominent\r\nrepresentative of Malaysia, for his excellent guidance of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly during its fifty-first session.\r\nI would also like to address words of the deepest respect\r\nto Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, for the\r\noutstanding manner in which he has demonstrated his\r\nqualities of leadership and good judgement.\r\nSeven years since the downfall of a polarized world\r\nand less than three years away from the year 2000, we\r\nare already living in a new era. Are we, the citizens of\r\nthe Earth, aware of the momentous changes and the new\r\nresponsibilities which they entail? When looking at\r\nourselves from the perspective of the Pathfinder on Mars,\r\nor of the space station Mir, do we see humanity in its\r\nentirety or, rather, spasmodic movements of an anthill,\r\nalways prepared to fight over every scrap, devoid of the\r\ngift of synthesis and without ability to perceive the\r\nwhole?\r\nThese are the questions which all of us, especially\r\nhere in this Hall, are confronted with. The burden of\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations for resisting dangers\r\nand facing challenges, for eliminating tensions and\r\nconstantly building foundations for the future, has not\r\nbeen relieved. It has not diminished. Perhaps it weighs\r\neven heavier today than ever before.\r\nFrom that moment in 1945, in San Francisco, when\r\nArthur Rubinstein, an outstanding piano virtuoso and a\r\ngreat Polish patriot, proudly inaugurated the United\r\nNations era with the notes of the Polish national anthem,\r\nuntil today, our Organization has given the impression of\r\nbeing oriented towards emergency actions rather than\r\nsystematic and comprehensive work programmes. The\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council are\r\nexcessively preoccupied with current issues. Nonetheless,\r\ntorn apart by the global confrontation between the free\r\nworld and totalitarianism, they attempted to find\r\nmechanisms of dialogue and negotiation that would\r\nprotect the world from global conflict. They have fulfilled\r\nthat role. No one, neither the fiercest opponents of the\r\nidea of the United Nations nor the greatest promoters of\r\nits radical modernization, can deny the United Nations\r\nachievements in maintaining world peace and security and\r\nresolving local conflicts. One has to bow to the visionary\r\nskills and political genius of the creators of the Atlantic\r\nCharter, which provided the foundation for our\r\nOrganization. Their work has stood the test of time in\r\ncircumstances unforeseeable when the system was\r\nestablished.\r\nUntil now we have been concentrating on avoiding\r\nwar. Shocked by the tragedy of the Second World War\r\nand the experience of ravages of previous wars, we have\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nput all our energy into the creed “Never again”. However,\r\nconcentrating on avoiding war, the United Nations has not\r\nalways been able to pay sufficient attention to building a\r\nworld for people, a world of harmonious existence and\r\nbalanced development. I should like to emphasize this point\r\nagain and again.\r\nThe time has come to pay more attention to building\r\na world for all people, of all races, all religions and all\r\ncultures, for people in the wealthier North and the poorer\r\nSouth.\r\nAn important area of international cooperation has\r\nbeen the effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction:\r\nnuclear, chemical and biological. This Organization has\r\nmade a significant contribution to this activity. Among the\r\nrecent milestones in this domain, I should mention the\r\nenactment of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical\r\nWeapons and on Their Destruction, as well as the signing\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We also\r\nconsider extremely important the ongoing work towards\r\nwider application and universalization of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the basis for a\r\nglobal regime of nuclear-arms non-proliferation.\r\nWe attach particular significance to the willingness of\r\nthe United States and the Russian Federation, as confirmed\r\nat the Helsinki summit this year, to continue the START\r\nnegotiations, taking them to a qualitatively new stage\r\ninvolving the radical reduction of nuclear arsenals. We trust\r\nthat the ratification of START II by the Russian Federation,\r\nupon which these negotiations are conditioned, will soon be\r\na fact, just as we hope that our expectations with regard to\r\nthe immediate ratification by Russia of the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention will become a reality in the near\r\nfuture. We welcome President Clinton’s decision to submit\r\nto the Senate for ratification the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty, as he announced from this rostrum.\r\nBoth for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of our\r\ncountry’s security interests, we attach great importance to\r\neffective actions aimed at limiting or banning conventional\r\nweapons, including anti-personnel landmines. We welcome\r\nthe momentous arrangements concerning this issue that\r\nwere agreed at the recent Oslo Diplomatic Conference. We\r\nbelieve, however, that the consolidation and universalization\r\nof these agreements should continue to be sought\r\npersistently at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.\r\nThis would guarantee participation in the negotiations of the\r\nmain manufacturers and exporters, which in turn would\r\nserve to take better into account the legitimate security\r\ninterests of all countries.\r\nIn this context of conventional disarmament, allow\r\nme to confess that it was with immense sadness that my\r\ndelegation — just like everyone else in the world —\r\nreceived the news of the tragic death of Diana, Princess\r\nof Wales, a great supporter of a ban on landmines.\r\nWe are currently starting a new and different stage\r\nin the history of the United Nations. The moment has\r\ncome to pose truly fundamental questions about the future\r\nand to provide answers. Global peace is a primary value,\r\nbut should we not reach beyond that? In our view, global\r\npeace is a fundamental precondition to the preservation of\r\nhuman dignity and the observance of human rights, to the\r\nenhancement of economic and political justice and to\r\nharmonious and sustainable development. But the time\r\nhas come for the United Nations to open up more so as\r\nto meet other challenges of contemporary civilization.\r\nUnited Nations agencies have already made progress\r\nin this direction. The experience they have accumulated,\r\nas well as their lasting achievements in the definite\r\nimprovement of living conditions for millions of people,\r\nconstitute an important starting point. In this respect,\r\nsufficient funding aimed at specific programmes is the\r\nprerequisite for success. We welcome donations and\r\nphilanthropy, which are an important source of additional\r\nfunding and a clear sign of public support. However, the\r\nUnited Nations needs a solid foundation for its activities,\r\nand regular contributions by all Members are\r\nindispensable.\r\nThe reforms proposed by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report, “Renewing the United Nations: A Programme\r\nfor Reform”, provide the basis for fundamental changes\r\nin the activities of our Organization that will allow it to\r\nserve better the needs and expectations of all the Member\r\nnations facing the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nIt is with hope and optimism that we welcome the\r\ninitiatives of the Secretary-General. We believe they will\r\nlead to improved effectiveness and better management of\r\nthe United Nations system. They increase the focus on\r\ndevelopment programmes and enhance the credibility of\r\nthe Organization. They strengthen the relationship\r\nbetween Member States and the United Nations. Poland\r\nsupports the proposed direction of the United Nations\r\nreforms. We are prepared to cooperate actively in this\r\nprocess, and we are vitally interested in further efforts to\r\nreinvigorate the United Nations system, including its\r\neconomic and social sectors.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nThere is no immediate threat of a global conflict, but\r\nlocal conflicts might often lead to conflicts on a much\r\ngreater scale. The world was not free of regional or even\r\ninternal conflicts before, but either their importance and\r\nramifications seemed less significant in the face of a threat\r\nof worldwide conflict, or they were temporarily frozen by\r\nthe cold war. With the ice melting, local conflicts ignited\r\nwith renewed intensity. The international community, fully\r\naware of the threat they presented, made efforts to assist in\r\ndefusing them, with varying degree of success.\r\nUnderstandably, the United Nations had a perception of its\r\nresponsibility and took action using the means at the\r\ndisposal of the Security Council. Poland supports all the\r\nefforts to institute the concept of rapid deployment in order\r\nto improve the capability of the United Nations to respond\r\nquickly to crisis situations. Our experience proves that the\r\nability to address local conflicts should be one of the\r\npriorities in our efforts to reform the Security Council.\r\nThe basic premise for balanced enlargement and\r\nreform of the Council should be the increased effectiveness\r\nof its work in an international environment which is\r\nundergoing fundamental changes. With our experience of\r\nnearly two years of participation in the Security Council,\r\nwe are inclined to conclude that the effectiveness of\r\nSecurity Council activities is greatly enhanced when it\r\nenjoys the full support of the respective regions represented\r\nin the United Nations. Therefore, we support the aspirations\r\nof various regional groups to additional seats in the Council\r\nif its membership is expanded. At the same time, Poland\r\nwould find it necessary to increase the representation of\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe in the Council by an additional\r\nmember. Thus, my Government is in favour of the\r\naccession of Japan and Germany to permanent seats.\r\nPoland is among the countries convinced of the\r\nnecessity of reforming the Council to adapt it to current and\r\nfuture tasks. While implementing these reforms, we should\r\ntake into consideration two parallel and sometimes\r\nconflicting tendencies: globalization and regionalization.\r\nThe emerging concept of regional responsibility should\r\nundergo consolidation. Its burden is being carried by\r\nregional organizations engaged in resolving regional\r\nconflicts, prominent cases in point being the activities of\r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina as well as those of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity.\r\nWe believe that regional organizations should be more\r\nengaged in preventive diplomacy and maintaining peace\r\nwhile ensuring full compatibility with the United Nations\r\nCharter. Thus, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is contributing to the\r\nfulfillment of the basic task of the United Nations —\r\nmaintaining international peace and security — through\r\nactive regional cooperation in both conflict prevention and\r\ncrisis management, as well as in post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation.\r\nWhen Poland assumes the duties of OSCE\r\nChairman-in-Office in 1998, it will make every effort to\r\nmaintain and develop further a high standard of\r\ncooperation between that Organization and the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn an atmosphere of global peace there is a much\r\nbetter chance to stand up to conflicts as old as humanity,\r\nsuch as religious conflicts, those between rich and poor\r\nand those between various ethnic groups.\r\nThe Polish people, with its historical experience of\r\ntimes of freedom and times of bondage, is gaining new\r\nexperience today. As the pioneer of the 1990s\r\nbreakthrough, which led to the end of a polarized world,\r\ntoday Poland is experiencing both joy and hardship: the\r\njoy of returning to the family of free nations and the\r\nhardship of a transformation period and the restructuring\r\nof our economy.\r\nThis year Poland has been undergoing a bitter test,\r\nfighting against a natural disaster unparalleled in\r\ncenturies: the catastrophic flood in the south and west of\r\nthe country. May I take this opportunity to extend our\r\nheartfelt thanks to the countries, organizations and persons\r\nof goodwill that have come to our assistance. If there is\r\nany lesson to be drawn from this horrible experience, it\r\nis that massive natural disasters are a kind of danger that\r\nwe all have to learn to withstand together.\r\nThis year’s flood, whose destructive force struck our\r\ncountry, also had a disastrous effect on our neighbors, in\r\nparticular the Czech Republic and Germany. We found\r\nthat such disasters can be faced much more effectively if\r\nthe preventive and rescue operations are organized on an\r\ninternational and, especially, a transboundary scale.\r\nThere is an old saying that a friend in need is a\r\nfriend indeed. But one can also find friends in moments\r\nof success and moments of joy. Thanks to the help of our\r\nfriends, and to their satisfaction, Poland crossed two great\r\nthresholds this year. It was invited to the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization and to the European Union.\r\nNegotiations with NATO are already under way, and\r\nthose with the European Union will commence at the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nbeginning of next year. Our readiness to shoulder\r\nresponsibility and our ability to meet the requirements have\r\nbeen recognized. Poland is now considered a reliable and\r\nrespected member of the community of democratic nations.\r\nThe outcome of our recently held parliamentary\r\nelections has confirmed that this basic orientation of our\r\nforeign policy will remain unchanged and is supported by\r\nthe overwhelming majority of the Polish people.\r\nThe world is still imperfect. Millions of people are\r\npaying — with their freedom, their dignity and sometimes\r\neven their lives — the price of lack of democracy and lack\r\nof respect for human rights. There are forces that feed on\r\nethnic antagonisms. Poverty is the fate of millions of people\r\nacross vast territories. But other problems on a global scale\r\nare also visible — climate changes and diverse\r\nenvironmental concerns, the constantly widening gap\r\nbetween rich and poor and the insufficient reach of\r\neducation and health care. The reforms which we undertake\r\nshould increase the United Nations capability to address\r\nthese important issues. Let me now elaborate on some of\r\nthem.\r\nThrough deep and carefully thought-out reform, we\r\nshould equip the United Nations with mechanisms capable\r\nof ensuring respect for the human rights of all the world’s\r\ncitizens to a greater degree than before. The United Nations\r\nevolution and reform introduce the human rights issue in\r\nquite a natural way to the Security Council agenda. We\r\nwelcome this trend. There is a clear connection between\r\ninternational security and respect for human rights, which\r\nshould be reflected in the activities of the Security Council.\r\nThe events of the past few years in Africa have again\r\ndramatically confirmed the existence of such a relationship.\r\n1998 will be a special year for human rights. Half a\r\ncentury ago the General Assembly adopted the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, a catalogue of the\r\nindividual’s rights and duties. However, the concept of\r\nhuman rights still varies from region to region. I think that\r\non the threshold of the twenty-first century, as we\r\nemphasized in Warsaw this January when inaugurating the\r\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, it is worth considering how\r\nto use this variety to build a universal concept of human\r\nrights, just as the Declaration initially assumed. At the same\r\ntime, however, we oppose any attempt at the so-called\r\nrevision of the Universal Declaration, which must remain\r\na common minimal standard for all humanity.\r\nAs a member of the United Nations Commission on\r\nHuman Rights starting on 1 January 1998, Poland\r\nconfirms its willingness to continue the dialogue and\r\ncooperation with representatives of all regional groups.\r\nObservance and promotion of human rights are for all of\r\nus a great challenge at the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nWe also believe that closer economic cooperation\r\nwith developing countries will help them overcome\r\ndifficulties and actively participate in the world economy.\r\nPoland is undertaking and will continue to undertake\r\nimportant projects in this field. We also want to point out\r\nthe important role of international institutions in providing\r\ndevelopment assistance for partners with lower levels of\r\nincome. We will continue to give them our support as\r\ntheir tasks require and our capacity allows.\r\nA year ago, in this General Assembly Hall, the\r\nPresident of Poland, Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski,\r\nformulated a proposal for the elaboration of an\r\ninternational convention against organized transnational\r\ncrime. We were encouraged by the massive support that\r\nthe Polish initiative received from the membership of this\r\nOrganization. We think that the international community\r\nshould take active measures to stop the spreading cancer\r\nof transnational crime. We must secure the effective\r\ncooperation of countries and organizations concerned.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations will find for\r\nitself a creative and constructive role through the\r\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,\r\nwhich has been entrusted with the task of elaborating this\r\nconvention. Poland is ready to cooperate with other\r\ncountries to extend the scope and range of the convention\r\nif such extension would meet the needs and expectations\r\nof Member States. We appreciate the work of the\r\nCommission on this subject and hope that the Assembly\r\nwill receive a final draft of the convention at its next\r\nsession.\r\nEqually important are the environmental issues. The\r\nmost important among them are those related to climate\r\nchanges. To deal effectively with such problems as the\r\ngreenhouse effect, melting of glaciers and the protection\r\nof tropical forests is a task far exceeding the ability of\r\nany single country or even region. It is hard to imagine\r\neffective action in this area unless we all join forces.\r\nIt is justifiable to reconsider whether the United\r\nNations is an organization capable of dealing with these\r\ntasks. The doubts voiced by the skeptics should not be\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nignored. However, Poland is among the countries that\r\nbelieve that the United Nations system can, through the\r\ncollective effort of its Members, meet the challenges. This\r\neffort has to be directed towards, among other things,\r\nunderstanding current and future dilemmas which reach\r\nbeyond this century. It must be sustained with a vision,\r\nshared by all Members of the system, of the shape they\r\nwish to give to tomorrow. It must involve the will to\r\ndevelop an organizational system and make it effective,\r\nwith each Member bearing its share of responsibility.\r\nToday’s Poland — democratic, economically successful,\r\nenjoying good relations with all its neighbours, binding\r\nitself to alliances with the European Union and NATO —\r\nis ready to participate in carrying out this task.\r\nWe must rise to the expectations of the United\r\nNations. As one of the Organization’s founding Members,\r\nPoland will not cease in its support of the United Nations\r\nas a global forum for resolving problems and conflicts, and\r\nespecially for ensuring a just and effective system of global\r\ngovernance aimed at eliminating threats to humanity.\r\nPoland stands ready to do its part for the purpose of\r\nachieving these lofty goals.\r\nAddress by Mr. Fatos Nano, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Albania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\na statement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nAlbania.\r\nMr. Fatos Nano, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fatos Nano, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Nano (Albania): Let me first join all the\r\ndistinguished personalities who have spoken before me\r\nfrom this rostrum in congratulating Mr. Udovenko on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly for the\r\ncurrent session and wishing him all possible success in this\r\nlofty post. I would also like to convey my high appreciation\r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for the excellent\r\nleadership he provided during his tenure of the previous\r\nGeneral Assembly presidency.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the\r\nSecretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to the\r\nhighest post of our global Organization. We are confident\r\nthat his long experience as an international civil servant\r\nand his correct assessment and proper action in\r\nimplementing the United Nations reform are guarantees of\r\nthe successful crowning of our efforts to have a stronger\r\nand more efficient Organization.\r\nBefore I deal with the more general questions\r\nconcerning our common work and efforts in the\r\nOrganization, I would like to dwell briefly on the\r\ndramatic events and developments that occurred in my\r\ncountry, in particular during the first half of the current\r\nyear, which were also of concern to the United Nations.\r\nThe Assembly is already aware of what happened in\r\nmy country, during which total chaos and anarchy reigned\r\nfor months. That was perhaps the biggest crisis in our\r\nmodern history. Albania has a peculiar history of chronic\r\nisolation, of almost total estrangement from the rest of the\r\nworld, of great potential, human and natural wealth, while\r\nbeing, at the same time, underdeveloped and poor. Our\r\ndifficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of\r\nformer rules and half a century of communism, of non-\r\nexistent, non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic\r\ninstitutions, both during and after the collapse of\r\ncommunism and its structures, as well as with our\r\nmentality. They are linked to flaws and shortcomings in\r\ndifferent fields, to clear tendencies to forsake freedom, to\r\npartisan intolerance, to lack of inter-party constructive\r\ncooperation, to mismanagement and corruption, to\r\nautocratic behaviour and decisions — not rare phenomena\r\nin our part of the world.\r\nIt was the great complexity of these and other\r\ndevelopments, coupled with the collapse of the get-rich-\r\nquick pyramid investment schemes, which led to broad\r\npopular frustration, disillusionment and general unrest and\r\nbrought the whole country to the state of unprecedented\r\nchaos and anarchy I mentioned a moment ago.\r\nIn these circumstances, the international community\r\nreacted promptly, displaying a remarkable sense of\r\nresponsibility, unity and solidarity amongst its members\r\nand with my people and country, one of the Members of\r\nthis Organization. The involvement of the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\r\nEuropean Union, the United Nations Security Council’s\r\nbenediction, and the well-balanced, all-out efforts and\r\ncontribution of important neighbours and friends helped\r\nus to prevent further aggravation and to alleviate and\r\ngradually overcome the crisis.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to commend in\r\nthe warmest possible terms the very serious commitment of\r\nthe OSCE; its Chairman-in-Office, Minister Petersen, and\r\nhis Personal Representative, former Austrian Chancellor,\r\nMr. Vranitzky; the United Nations and its Security Council\r\nfor their prompt response to this emergency situation\r\nthrough their relevant decisions, resolutions and concrete\r\nactions. Let me also thank most warmly all the troop-\r\ncontributing States — France, Greece, Turkey, Spain,\r\nRomania, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Belgium and\r\nSlovenia — which, under the excellent leadership and\r\ncommand of Italy, made the entire effort of the\r\nMultinational Protection Force a full success in the\r\nimplementation of its mandate. Last but not least, I would\r\nwish to express my deep appreciation and thanks to the\r\nEuropean Union and all the other international and regional\r\norganizations, the United States of America, as well as to\r\nother individual States, for the continuous support and\r\nassistance they have given and are giving my country. My\r\npeople are indebted to them and to all here.\r\nThis highly appreciated assistance helped us start a\r\nprocess of reconciliation and gradual restoration of political\r\nstability in the country. It is also a reflection of historical\r\nlessons learned in today’s efforts to establish a peaceful,\r\ndemocratic and united Europe, without walls and fully free,\r\nin which the integration processes should be comprehensive\r\nenough not to exclude any country, even the weakest, as\r\nPope John Paul II said. This is the only road to ensuring\r\nthat the universal principles which this global Organization\r\nand others stand for are permanently upheld and defended.\r\nThe successful holding of elections in Albania on 29\r\nJune, which were considered by the international\r\ncommunity as adequate and acceptable, can and must be the\r\nfoundation for a stable democratic system. They showed the\r\nstrong desire of my people for a democratic future for\r\nAlbania. The coalition Government which emerged from\r\nthese elections is fully determined to work with a new\r\nphilosophy based on cooperation and coexistence, on\r\nsharing and, at the same time, assuming responsibilities, by\r\nthe majority and the minority alike. The guiding yardstick\r\nwill be making maximum use of internal capacities as the\r\nbest way to ensure continuation of the spirit of\r\nunderstanding, the process of reconciliation, constructive\r\ncooperation, economic recovery and the overall return of\r\nnormalcy to the country in the shortest possible time. This\r\nis the spirit we have decided to be guided by, as personified\r\nbrilliantly by the Albanian famous worldwide, Mother\r\nTeresa.\r\nWe do hope and will work to ensure that this\r\nprocess will bring about the necessary transformation of\r\nthe country into a reliable partner that truly shares\r\ncommon democratic values and qualifies for its gradual\r\nbut sure integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures it has\r\nthe objective to achieve.\r\nLet me inform the Assembly that our main, urgent\r\nchallenge remains the restoration of public order and\r\nsecurity in the country. Therefore, we have devoted\r\nmaximum and special attention to it. Lack of public order\r\nand security cannot coexist with the development of the\r\neconomy and democratic values. Intensive work is already\r\nunder way on the basis of short- and long-term plans.\r\nSpecial emphasis is being put on and we have\r\nstarted work towards the reorganization of the army, with\r\nthe objective of gradually having a smaller, more efficient\r\nand professional force under strict civilian control, in\r\nconformity with all standards of modern armies, capable\r\nof performing its functions properly and of being a\r\ngenuine partner in partnership activities. Various problems\r\npersist in the economic field, where we have witnessed a\r\nquasi-paralysis of life and the deterioration of all micro-\r\nand macroeconomic indices. In cooperation with and the\r\nassistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and\r\nthe World Bank, we hope we will be able to deal\r\nsuccessfully with the main economic and social priorities.\r\nWe have already started work in this direction, for both\r\nthe emergency situation and the mid-long-term\r\nperspective.\r\nAlbania is determined to go ahead with the\r\ndemocratization processes in general — the rebuilding,\r\nestablishment and proper functioning of democratic\r\ninstitutions to ensure the true entrenchment of the rule of\r\nlaw in all its dimensions.\r\nAll of these issues were discussed in Rome at the\r\npreparatory meeting for the upcoming ministerial meeting\r\nto be held in that city and the donors conference set to\r\ntake place in Brussels next month. We are prepared for\r\nthese meetings to begin the implementation of what we\r\nhave achieved and will agree upon, in close cooperation\r\nwith the relevant organizations.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I should like to pay\r\ntribute to all of the international organizations and\r\nfinancial institutions, from the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies to the European and Euro-Atlantic\r\nbodies as well as individual countries, which have since\r\nthe beginning of this process shown unstinting interest\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nand commitment in working in their respective areas of\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe main objective of my Government’s foreign\r\npolicy is directly to contribute to the enhancement of peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in our region and in Europe through\r\na gradual integration into all relevant Euro-Atlantic\r\nstructures.\r\nAlbania’s past, present and future are closely linked,\r\nin a variety of ways, with those of our neighbours. Like all\r\nneighbours, we share not only common borders but also,\r\nwe hope, common interests and values and a common\r\nfuture. This requires our full participation in the European\r\nintegration processes, in a common Europe united by these\r\nvalues and not characterized by friction and confrontation.\r\nRelations with neighbouring countries and peace and\r\nstability in the region are of paramount importance for us.\r\nWe will continue to work constructively and openly to\r\nsolve all the pending problems that involve vital national\r\ninterests for Albania and represent a major concern for the\r\ninternational community. One such question is that of\r\nKosovo. Inter-linked issues — good relations with\r\nneighbouring countries, peace and stability in the region,\r\nand the situation in Kosovo and its just solution — should\r\nbe pursued in a complementary manner, with none of them\r\nopposing, undercutting or jeopardizing the others.\r\nI should like to say a few words about the situation in\r\nKosovo and how we see its future, because unless this\r\nquestion is dealt with properly and settled accordingly, this\r\nserious issue could continue to threaten peace and regional\r\nstability. Kosovo has been on the agenda of the\r\ninternational community, and in particular of the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\r\nEuropean Union, for years now. Unfortunately, the situation\r\nthere remains the same, and we are not sure how long the\r\nstatus quo can be maintained. Police violence and brutality,\r\nmassive repression and gross violations of human, political\r\nand national rights — which we strongly condemn —\r\ncontinue unabated in Kosovo. The Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia has given no real, concrete sign of changing its\r\nattitude, despite three General Assembly resolutions, one\r\nSecurity Council resolution and scores of OSCE decisions\r\nand statements.\r\nWe appeal to this global Organization, to European\r\norganizations and structures, to those who made a major\r\ncontribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the\r\nDayton accords and to all those who have the power and\r\nthe political will to continue to exert the necessary\r\npressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans\r\nonto the path of negotiation, with proper international\r\nmediation, with a view to a just, peaceful and democratic\r\nsolution acceptable to all. Perhaps a mini Dayton-type\r\nconference aimed at solving all the remaining problems of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, including and focusing on the\r\nKosovo issue, might do the job by Europeanizing our\r\nregion, a process that would have to start with a full-scale\r\nreactivation of Balkan cooperation.\r\nThe General Assembly will hopefully be able to\r\nsend another message to all those concerned, in particular\r\nthe people of Kosovo, that the international community\r\ncontinues to be deeply concerned and seized of the\r\nmatter, that it supports and encourages peaceful\r\napproaches, and that it wants to see positive changes in\r\nthe right direction.\r\nMy country fully supports all the efforts under way\r\nto ensure the full and unequivocal implementation of all\r\nthe Dayton accords. It considers attempts to circumvent\r\nor avoid certain Dayton provisions as dangerous, with\r\nimplications that could go beyond its scope. We maintain\r\nthat there is no alternative to the full implementation of\r\nDayton.\r\nThe Albanian Government is strongly committed to\r\npromoting and actively taking part in regional\r\ncooperation, knowing that democratization, market\r\neconomy prosperity, good-neighbourly relations and\r\nconstructive cooperation are prerequisites for the secure\r\nenvironment and prosperity that our region deserves, as\r\nwell as for the realization of our country’s aspirations to\r\na gradual but full European integration. Our vision for our\r\nregion’s future is a Schengen-type approach. We believe\r\nthat regional initiatives such as the Conference on\r\nEuropean Stability, Security and Cooperation in South-\r\nEastern Europe, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and\r\ninitiatives of the Commonwealth of Independent States,\r\ninter alia, are worthy steps that are also contributing to\r\nthis end.\r\nAlbania is highly appreciative of the efforts, the\r\nassistance and the contribution of the Organization with\r\nrespect to conflict resolution in various parts of the globe.\r\nWe sincerely wish for peace to be established and reign\r\nin all those parts of the earth that are still being shaken\r\nby internal or other conflicts. We hope that the role and\r\ncontribution of the Organization, with its reform\r\nprogramme fully implemented, will be further enhanced\r\nin this direction. All Member States should do their\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nutmost to achieve this common objective. By so doing, the\r\nlead members will be able to provide better guidance\r\nthrough the United Nations, and all of us will work better\r\ntogether.\r\nAlbania is fully and unreservedly supportive of the\r\nMiddle East peace process and of the intensive and ongoing\r\nefforts to bring that process back on track. Mutual\r\nconfidence must somehow be restored, as it is the only\r\nalternative to ensuring continued progress in the peace\r\nnegotiations. We are confident that the unsparing and\r\nconcerted efforts under way will yield the awaited results.\r\nWe participated in and followed with great interest the\r\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly on the\r\nenvironment and consider it to have made an important\r\ncontribution to resolving the environmental problems\r\naffecting the earth. Similarly, Albania considers the special\r\nsession on the fight against drugs and related activities, due\r\nto be held next year, as another very significant\r\ncontribution to promoting and further strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation in this highly sensitive field.\r\nThe open debate in the Security Council last May on\r\nhumanitarian crises and the protection of the civilian\r\npopulation was another indication that there is great\r\nconcern, preparedness and political will to deal with these\r\nconflicts at an early stage, before they develop into real\r\ncrises, thus playing a major preventive role. We all look\r\nforward to this. Prevention is the best medicine, because a\r\nproblem can become very costly to treat and be hard to\r\ncure.\r\nAlbania has tried its best to make a modest\r\ncontribution to the activities of the United Nations,\r\nincluding the significant fact that we are on the list of\r\ncountries ready to contribute to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. Our objective in future is to play\r\nan even more active role in this direction, as well as in\r\noperations of an international humanitarian character. One\r\nsuch objective has already been included in our platform\r\nfor the reorganization and restructuring of the army.\r\nWe intend to play a more active role in the activities\r\nof main bodies of the Organization, including the Economic\r\nand Social Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme, the\r\nCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and\r\nthe leading bodies of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency, the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization and others. Individual concerns should be\r\ntreated as, and should become, the concerns of all. In\r\naddressing individual concerns, participation and\r\ncontribution by all members of the community of States,\r\neach within its capacity and making available all possible\r\nresources, even if modest, will make the Organization\r\nmore comprehensive and substantive, and its role\r\ngenuinely more effective.\r\nThe Organization has started a process aimed at\r\nachieving the overall reform of the Organization and its\r\nsystem in order to make the United Nations and its role\r\ntruly more effective and capable of coping with the new\r\nchallenges and dynamics of the ever-changing world\r\nreality. To do so, all Members should live up to their\r\nobligations. We also feel the need for greater efforts to\r\nenhance efficiency, which would lead to an enhanced role\r\nfor the Organization. Reform should not take place for\r\nreform’s sake. We believe it should be our duty to define\r\nour needs in order to have reforms that are not only\r\nstructural. We must ensure that money is saved not as a\r\none-shot exercise but as a long-lasting process with its\r\naccent on transfers for the economic development of those\r\nwho are most in need. We support action in this direction.\r\nWe have taken very serious note of the work of the\r\nSecretary-General for United Nations reform in general,\r\nand of his proposals for the reform of the Secretariat. We\r\nappreciate his proposals and believe they represent the\r\nright approach.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is one of the\r\nmost sensitive issues and is part of the reform package. It\r\ntook our Organization almost the half century of its\r\nexistence to come to this point. No one can say for sure\r\nwhen, if at all, the Security Council will be reformed\r\nagain in the future. Therefore, there might still be some\r\nwork to be done in this direction, without necessarily\r\nmaking haste or getting caught up in endless discussions.\r\nWith a clear objective, we will be able to show the\r\nmaturity necessary to give the Council the right, balanced,\r\nflexible, democratic representation capable of successfully\r\ndealing with the challenges and objective of the next\r\ncentury: to live in peace and harmony; to live in and\r\nleave to our children a better world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Albania\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Fatos Nano, Prime Minister of Albania, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I call now on His Excellency\r\nMr. Abel Matutes, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Spain.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nMr. Matutes (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nshould like at the outset to make two imperative\r\nacknowledgments. The first is to congratulate Ambassador\r\nHennadiy Udovenko on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly — and to congratulate the Assembly on\r\nthe election of an insightful and experienced politician to\r\npreside over this session — which may, for many reasons,\r\nprove to be an exceptional one.\r\nThe second is addressed to the Secretary-General at\r\nthis first regular session convened under his mandate. Mr.\r\nKofi Annan is a veteran of the United Nations system,\r\nwhich explains how, in the short time since he took up the\r\npost of Secretary-General, he has been able to submit an\r\nimportant programme for the comprehensive reform of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nI wish also to state my Government’s full support of\r\nthe statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nLuxembourg on behalf of the European Union. Spain shares\r\nthe commitment of the European Union to the reform of the\r\nOrganization; it is specifically upon this matter that my\r\nstatement will be focused.\r\nWhen we speak of the reform of the Organization, we\r\nfrequently link it with the financial crisis which the United\r\nNations is undergoing. Yet I consider it important to\r\ndifferentiate the two questions and to emphasize that the\r\nreform process must not be seen solely as a remedy or\r\nfactor for saving the United Nations from the financial\r\ncrisis. On the one hand, the current crisis is fundamentally\r\na crisis of payments. I shall return to this matter later on.\r\nOn the other hand, the Organization’s supposed “failures”\r\nreflect the limits of cooperation in the international\r\ncommunity as it exists at present.\r\nThe crisis is, in any case, one of growth. The United\r\nNations has to adapt and do away with the bureaucratic\r\nobstacles accumulated by the Organization during the\r\ndecades of the cold war and to develop new means with\r\nwhich to tackle the complex situations it now faces.\r\nThe great virtue of the reform programme introduced\r\nby the Secretary-General on 16 July is that, building on the\r\nbetter part of the thinking of recent years, it presents a\r\ncomprehensive plan to adapt all sectors of the Organization.\r\nRecent experience has shown the difficulty of implementing\r\npartial reforms. The links among the main functions\r\nentrusted to the United Nations is becoming increasingly\r\nclear: international peace and security can hardly be\r\nmaintained without genuine cooperation to promote the\r\ndevelopment of the world’s States and regions, and\r\nwithout respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nI should like straight away to declare Spain’s\r\nagreement with this approach and to make clear the\r\nbacking which my country is willing to give to the\r\nSecretary-General’s programme. I will now present the\r\nviews of the Spanish Government on the main aspects of\r\nthe overall reform process.\r\nI shall begin with the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. This is undoubtedly one of the most significant\r\nquestions facing us, and its success will determine if the\r\nOrganization will be able to enhance its legitimacy and its\r\neffectiveness in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity in the future. The reform of the Security Council\r\nis a most sensitive task, involving an amendment to the\r\nCharter; it must therefore be undertaken carefully, without\r\nhaste and on the basis of the broadest possible agreement.\r\nIt must promote greater cohesion among the\r\nOrganization’s Members and not create greater tension\r\nand suspicion among them. We should not forget: poorly-\r\ndone reform could bring grave repercussions for the\r\nOrganization, which could lead to an irreparable crisis of\r\nconfidence.\r\nAn increase in the number of members of the\r\nSecurity Council, and particularly of permanent members,\r\nis a much more contentious issue than the improvement\r\nof the Council’s working procedures. The category of\r\npermanent members of the Security Council was created\r\nin historical circumstances which no longer apply.\r\nFurthermore, the enlargement of that category could\r\ncreate more problems than benefits. Therefore, we\r\nconsider it wisest in the present situation to limit\r\nenlargement to the category of non-permanent members.\r\nCurrent proposals for enlarging the permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council introduce formulas\r\nwhich tend to meet the legitimate interests of a few\r\nStates, but fail to resolve serious problems raised for the\r\nvast majority of Members of the Organization, and so\r\nthey cannot be positive for the United Nations as a whole.\r\nAs far as the veto is concerned, aware of the\r\ndifficulty in present circumstances of achieving its\r\nelimination, we propose that it be limited to situations\r\ninvolving Chapter VII of the Charter. In any case,\r\nproposals for the creation of new permanent seats, with\r\npostponement of discussion as to whether those seats\r\nwould or would not have the veto, are not very realistic.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nThe leading role acquired by the United Nations at the\r\nend of the cold war in making, maintaining and\r\nconsolidating peace is without historical precedent.\r\nSpain unreservedly supports United Nations efforts in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. In the\r\nlast year, in addition to the Spanish contingents deployed in\r\nthe International Police Task Force (IPTF) and the\r\nStabilization Force (SFOR), forces from my country have\r\nparticipated in the United Nations Mission for the\r\nVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the\r\nCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\r\nRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) demobilization process\r\nand in the multinational protection force for Albania, which,\r\nas the Prime Minister stressed just a few minutes ago, has\r\nhelped to avoid a serious internal conflict. Spain was also\r\nready to participate in the multinational force for Zaire. My\r\nGovernment is also studying ways of enhancing the\r\nOrganization’s operational readiness, particularly by\r\nincreasing its rapid deployment capabilities.\r\nWhile dealing with this matter, I must refer briefly to\r\ncertain situations of special interest to my Government. The\r\ndeterioration of the situation in the Serb Republic is a cause\r\nof special concern. We must continue to give firm backing\r\nto those in the Republic who are willing to cooperate with\r\nSFOR, the High Representative and the special envoys.\r\nSub-Saharan Africa also deserves special attention. Of\r\nparticular concern is the serious situation which persists in\r\nthe Great Lakes region and in the Republic of Congo. Spain\r\nsupports the efforts under way to restore peace, as well as\r\nthe holding of an international conference under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU). Likewise, with reference to the\r\nsituation in Angola, Spain joins the appeal to UNITA to\r\ncomply with its international commitments and to finally\r\nallow peace to come to this country.\r\nMy Government welcomes the recent agreements\r\nreached in Houston to unblock implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations settlement plan for Western Sahara, and\r\naccordingly wishes to congratulate Morocco and the\r\nPolisario Front. I equally wish to congratulate the Personal\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. James Baker, on the\r\nefficient mediation work he has performed. My Government\r\nconsiders that the holding of a referendum, freely and with\r\ninternational guarantees, in which the Sahraqui people will\r\nexercise their right to self-determination, continues to be the\r\nonly acceptable solution to this conflict. Spain, which has\r\nalways supported the settlement plan, considers therefore\r\nthat the extension of the mandate of the United Nations\r\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\r\n(MINURSO) is indispensable. My Government trusts that\r\nthe parties will continue to demonstrate flexibility and a\r\nconstructive spirit until the referendum is held.\r\nSpain is also following developments in the Middle\r\nEast with the greatest concern. The peace process is,\r\nwithout a doubt, going through one of its most difficult\r\nphases. However, this dialogue is the only possible\r\nalternative. The European Union, in particular through its\r\nSpecial Envoy, the Spanish diplomat Miguel Angel\r\nMoratinos, is making major efforts. I should like here to\r\nreiterate the Spanish Government’s commitment to this\r\nprocess and to restate our willingness to continue to work\r\nactively for peace and understanding among the peoples\r\nof the region.\r\nWith the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and\r\nLasting Peace in Guatemala, a process in which Spain\r\nplayed an active role in the verification of compliance\r\nwith the accords, the way has been paved to stability, the\r\nstrengthening of democratic institutions and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Guatemala. Spain will continue to support\r\nthis process, through practical measures such as\r\nmultilateral and bilateral cooperation.\r\nAs I have already indicated, peacekeeping has\r\nbecome a multifaceted activity. In addition to military\r\nactivities, it has become essential to take into account the\r\nhumanitarian consequences of conflicts. In fact, the\r\nhumanitarian role of the United Nations is increasingly\r\nlinked to peacekeeping. Spain accordingly supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiatives to enhance the coordination\r\nand rapid deployment capability of the United Nations\r\nhumanitarian response through the establishment of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordination Office.\r\nTogether with my Government’s official\r\nhumanitarian aid, I must refer here to the commitment of\r\nSpanish civil society to such humanitarian operations, and\r\npay tribute to all the international relief workers and\r\nmissionaries who, generously and at risk to their very\r\nlives, are deployed in war-devastated areas. Five Spanish\r\nrelief workers and four missionaries have been killed in\r\nrecent months while performing their humanitarian tasks.\r\nSpain considers that additional measures must be adopted\r\nto protect those participating in these humanitarian\r\nmissions, and we intend to introduce a proposal to that\r\nend during this session.\r\nRecent experience of the conflicts in the former\r\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda has highlighted the need to\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\ncreate a judicial body to prevent impunity and to facilitate\r\nreconciliation of war-torn societies and consolidate the\r\npeace process. The creation of an international criminal\r\ncourt is thus a matter to which the Spanish Government\r\nattaches great importance.\r\nConcern for the protection and promotion of human\r\nrights, which is becoming one of the Organization’s\r\nprincipal functions, underlies all these developments. As of\r\n10 December and throughout 1998 we will be celebrating\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. This will be an appropriate time to assess\r\nthe situation and to devise strategies which will allow us to\r\ncontinue to move forward in the advancement of human\r\nrights.\r\nAs pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report,\r\nthe United Nations human rights programme must be\r\nintegrated into the whole range of the Organization’s\r\nactivities. Spain supports the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\nto consolidate the Centre for Human Rights and the Office\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and stresses\r\nthe need to increase the human and financial resources\r\ndevoted to the human rights programme.\r\nSpain will maintain an active policy in defence of\r\nhuman rights and will help to ensure general respect for\r\nhuman rights and for democratic principles.\r\nAnother of the Organization’s major functions is\r\ncooperation for development. Spain welcomes the proposals\r\nput forward in this area by the Secretary-General. In\r\nparticular, I should like to stress my support for the\r\nSecretary-General’s various initiatives aimed at ensuring the\r\nrelease of more funds for operational programmes.\r\nThe inclusion in development cooperation activities of\r\nother than purely economic factors — such as social and\r\nenvironmental ones — is the expression of a concept to\r\nwhich the United Nations has given primary attention\r\nthrough a number of international conferences held under\r\nits auspices. I am referring to the subject of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI would like to underline in this respect the importance\r\nthat the Spanish Government attaches to environmental\r\nmatters and our special interest in the problem of\r\ndesertification, which affects Spain so directly. I wish to\r\nnote in this context that my country is presenting the\r\ncandidature of Murcia as headquarters of the permanent\r\nsecretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification. I\r\nam convinced that Murcia would be an excellent\r\nheadquarters, and I therefore ask Members for their\r\nsupport.\r\nThe attainment of effective international cooperation\r\nin the fight against terrorism is a priority objective for my\r\nGovernment. The phenomenon of terrorism cannot be\r\ncontrolled without complete and active cooperation at all\r\nlevels. The conceptual advances made in the area of\r\nextradition that have taken place within the European\r\nUnion must be furthered in the United Nations. The\r\nSpanish Government participates actively in the\r\nnegotiations on the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, aimed at creating an\r\neffective tool in the fight against terrorism that is\r\nacceptable to the largest possible number of countries.\r\nSpain also supports the Declaration on Measures to\r\nEliminate International Terrorism and the Supplement to\r\nthat Declaration adopted by the Assembly at its last\r\nsession.\r\nIn this connection, I cannot fail to mention the tragic\r\nsituation in Algeria, a country which is a neighbour and\r\na friend of Spain and which has the solidarity and support\r\nof my Government in its battle against the plague of\r\nterrorism. The Algerian Government can count on\r\nSpanish backing to continue resolutely the process of\r\npolitical reform, in order to achieve the widest possible\r\nbase of support among the population, ensure peaceful\r\nand lasting coexistence and to eradicate terrorism.\r\nThe fight against drug trafficking is also a question\r\nof the greatest importance to Spain, and it is one that\r\nundoubtedly has connections with terrorism and\r\ntransnational crime. My Government therefore supports\r\nthe creation in Vienna of an international crime\r\nprevention centre designed to reinforce the Organization’s\r\ncapacity to combat these scourges.\r\nSpain is pleased with the decisive role played by the\r\nUnited Nations in disarmament and arms control. Spain\r\nwelcomes the outcome of the Oslo Conference and will\r\nbe signing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction, while promoting\r\ndiscussion of this question in Geneva at the Conference\r\non Disarmament.\r\nThe preparation of a protocol to strengthen the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention — particularly in the\r\nfield of verification; the negotiation of a convention to\r\nban fissionable material for the manufacture of nuclear\r\nweapons; and the improvement of control and\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\ntransparency in conventional weapons: these are also\r\nmatters of importance.\r\nThe process of decolonization has without any doubt\r\nbeen one of the Organization’s greatest successes. It may\r\ntherefore seem anachronistic to refer to this matter in a\r\nstatement that deals with the reform of the United Nations\r\nand that focuses on the present and the most immediate\r\nfuture, rather than on the past. The reality, however, is that\r\nunresolved colonial situations unfortunately continue to\r\nexist, and our Organization still has to deal with them.\r\nWith regard to these situations, Spain is affected\r\ndirectly and painfully by the question of Gibraltar. The\r\nexistence of this colony on our territory — the colony of a\r\nState that, like Spain, belongs, to the Atlantic Alliance and\r\nto the European Union — is an anomaly and an\r\nanachronism that we are trying to resolve within the context\r\nof the doctrine established by the United Nations. In\r\nresolution 2353 (XXII), and in accordance with resolution\r\n1514 (XV), the General Assembly acknowledged that the\r\ncolonial status of Gibraltar violates Spanish territorial\r\nintegrity and that the principle of self-determination\r\ntherefore does not apply. The territory of Gibraltar was an\r\nintegral part of Spain, and the Spaniards who lived there\r\nwere expelled when a military base was established.\r\nPursuant to the repeated invitations made by the\r\nUnited Nations to Spain and to the United Kingdom to\r\nsettle this matter by negotiation, my Government is engaged\r\nin the search for a solution through the bilateral channel\r\nestablished in the Brussels Declaration of November 1984.\r\nThe Spanish authorities have given repeated assurances that\r\nthe legitimate interests of the inhabitants of Gibraltar will\r\nbe respected. I very recently and publicly formulated a most\r\ngenerous offer whereby, following the reincorporation of\r\nGibraltar into Spain, the current inhabitants of the colony\r\nwould be allowed to retain the broad outlines of their\r\npresent economic and legal situation. We believe that this\r\noffer should help us advance in the bilateral negotiations\r\nwith the United Kingdom.\r\nWe all agree on to the irreplaceable nature of our\r\nOrganization and on the need to reform it. However, our\r\nOrganization cannot prosper, nor can the reforms be put in\r\nplace, if we Member States do not comply in full with our\r\nfinancial commitments. As the Secretary-General himself\r\nhas pointed out, the Organization’s present financial crisis\r\nis a payments crisis. The punctual and full payment of\r\ncontributions is an international legal obligation that should\r\nbe recognized by all States that respect the international\r\nrule of law. It is unacceptable that any Member State\r\nshould place conditions on these payments or on the\r\npayment of arrears. Such a practice would lead eventually\r\nto the bankruptcy of the Organization we defend.\r\nAs early as 1996, the European Union introduced a\r\nproposal designed to encourage States to meet their\r\nfinancial obligations to the Organization and to establish\r\na fairer scale of assessments. Spain hopes that this\r\nproposal will be carefully considered at this session.\r\nThe United Nations is the main international forum\r\nentrusted with maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, with promoting development, human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms and with ensuring cooperation\r\nbetween States. The indispensable nature of its role has\r\nbecome clear in recent years.\r\nFinally, I would like to restate the Spanish\r\nGovernment’s firm commitment to the purposes contained\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations and to reassert our\r\nunshakeable determination to continue to participate in the\r\nreform process in the firm belief that, together, we will be\r\nable to adapt the United Nations to the requirements of\r\nthe new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and External Trade of Iceland, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Halldór Ásgrímsson.\r\nMr. Asgrimsson (Iceland): May I begin by\r\ncongratulating the President on his election to preside\r\nover the fifty-second session of General Assembly and\r\npledging to him the full support of my delegation.\r\nThe new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\r\nalready put his mark on the United Nations, after less\r\nthan nine months in office. He has led efforts to reform\r\nour Organization in an effective, fair and balanced\r\nmanner. I congratulate him and pledge the unwavering\r\nsupport of my Government for his important mission.\r\nIncreasingly, as we approach the new millennium,\r\nwe have come to appreciate the value of international\r\ncooperation, as most clearly demonstrated by the historic\r\nfirst meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO)/Russia Permanent Joint Council in a ministerial\r\nsession that took place here in this building today.\r\nThe information revolution is advancing, and a new\r\nsense of global neighbourhood and the gradual abolition\r\nof trade barriers are raising the level of economic well-\r\nbeing in different parts of the world. At the same time,\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nthe world community is faced with challenges of a new\r\norder of magnitude, making it necessary for Governments\r\nto pool their resources and work together.\r\nGlobal forces are in many ways eroding the traditional\r\nboundaries between nation States. The trend calls for the\r\nstrengthening of international organizations competent to\r\ntackle issues that no single State or groups of States can\r\ndeal with in isolation. Consequently, it is crucial that we\r\nstrengthen the United Nations. Without a reinvigorated\r\nUnited Nations, the international community will not be in\r\na position to address the foremost challenges confronting\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nSadly, our Organization has not been endowed to meet\r\nthose challenges. Demands on the United Nations are\r\ngreater than ever, and the limited resources at the\r\nOrganization’s disposal are grossly disproportionate to the\r\ntasks in hand. The question inevitably arises: Do we wish\r\nto give the United Nations a clear and focused mandate and\r\nempower it to carry that mandate out? In my opinion our\r\nanswer should be the same as the one Winston Churchill\r\nonce gave:\r\n“Give us the tools and we will finish the job”.\r\nOnce more we must urge all Member States to pay\r\ntheir contributions to the Organization fully and on time.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reform initiative is the most\r\ncomprehensive attempt to date at fashioning the United\r\nNations of tomorrow into an instrument capable of serving\r\nthe common interests of all peoples, guided by the enduring\r\ntenets of peace, human rights, the rule of law and social\r\nprogress, enshrined in the Charter more than half a century\r\nago. Coming at the end of a thorough and useful debate,\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report is in large part a distillation\r\nof views expressed by individual Governments.\r\nInevitably, the report represents a compromise,\r\nunlikely to accommodate all the wishes of a single State or\r\ngroup of States. But, taken as a whole, it represents the best\r\neffort to obtain what is realistically feasible under the\r\ncircumstances. The reform package should, in our opinion,\r\nbe accepted as an integral whole.\r\nA focused discussion on the Secretary-General’s report\r\nshould give a boost to the ongoing debate among Member\r\nStates on an increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as a more equitable representation on the\r\nCouncil. The Nordic countries have jointly presented their\r\nideas on this issue. Iceland welcomes the paper submitted\r\nby the Chairman of the Security Council Working Group,\r\nwhich is largely in line with the suggestions of the Nordic\r\ncountries, and hopes that efforts to resolve this\r\nfundamental aspect of the entire reform process may be\r\nbrought to a successful conclusion during the current\r\nsession.\r\nAlthough the reform of our Organization and its\r\nlong-term credibility must have a high priority, regional\r\nconflicts continually demand our attention.\r\nIn the Middle East, the situation has rarely been\r\nmore uncertain since the signing of the Oslo accords. The\r\nparties to the accords must not be distracted from\r\npursuing the path of peace. They should refrain from\r\ncreating unnecessary hurdles in the path of peace by\r\nprovocative undertakings likely to cause hostility,\r\nsuspicion and fear. There should be a clear and\r\nunambiguous recognition that terrorism against innocent\r\ncivilians is wholly incompatible with the pursuit of peace.\r\nBoth parties have to ensure that international norms in the\r\nfield of human rights and humanitarian law are respected.\r\nA troubled African continent remains at the top of\r\nthe United Nations agenda. In sub-Saharan Africa,\r\nparticularly the Great Lakes region, the situation is\r\nworrying. The United Nations, in cooperation with\r\nregional leaders and organizations, must spare no effort to\r\nprevent the peoples of this region from further suffering.\r\nBy contrast, encouraging developments have taken\r\nplace in Western Sahara, where direct talks, held under\r\nthe auspices of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, have greatly improved prospects for a\r\nreferendum on the future of the region.\r\nArms control and disarmament will continue to\r\noccupy an important place in the activities of our\r\nOrganization. Our most immediate goal should be in the\r\narea of conventional arms: to work for a comprehensive\r\nban on that most terrible destroyer of the lives and limbs\r\nof innocent people, the anti-personnel landmine. The\r\nrecently concluded Oslo conference on this menace has\r\nprovided a welcome impetus to work towards a binding\r\ntreaty. Iceland strongly urges all States to banish this\r\ninhumane weapon from their arsenals.\r\nHuman rights, which are of intrinsic value in\r\nthemselves, are also a vital part of efforts to secure peace\r\nand stability in areas torn by wars and internal conflict.\r\nNext year marks the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My\r\nGovernment applauds the Secretary-General’s proposed\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nstreamlining of the work of the United Nations in the field\r\nof human rights, bearing witness to a strong emphasis on\r\nthis crucially important aspect of our work.\r\nUnfortunately, the human rights of women continue to\r\nbe disregarded. As the Secretary-General observed in this\r\nforum earlier this week, violence against women has\r\nbecome the most pervasive human rights violation. The\r\ninternational community must work harder to correct this\r\nsituation and to improve the lot of women everywhere, not\r\nleast through the creation of better education and\r\nemployment opportunities.\r\nTrafficking in drugs is a peril that recognizes no\r\nnational boundaries. To a greater or lesser degree, we are\r\nall affected by it. In addition to the cost in human lives and\r\nsuffering, we are witness to calamities that follow in the\r\nwake of drug abuse, the spread of AIDS, prostitution and\r\ncrime. Iceland welcomes United Nations efforts in the area\r\nof drug prevention and looks forward to the special session\r\nof the General Assembly on the problem of drugs next\r\nJune.\r\nNext year has been declared the International Year of\r\nthe Ocean by the United Nations. The world’s oceans are\r\na crucial part of the earth’s biosphere, in addition to being\r\nthe single largest source of protein for mankind. This vital\r\nresource is now threatened in some regions of the world.\r\nTherefore, it is important that the Year of the Ocean be\r\nused to raise public awareness and to reinforce efforts to\r\nprotect the marine ecosystem. A global, legally binding\r\nagreement should be concluded to limit the emission of\r\npersistent organic pollutants.\r\nProblems afflicting the marine ecosystem call for\r\ngreater coordination at the global level, and also in the\r\nsustainable use, conservation and management of living\r\nmarine resources. At the same time, we must recognize that\r\nthe primary responsibility for harvesting marine resources\r\nin a sustainable manner rests with the States that depend on\r\nsuch resources for survival. Also, while Governments must\r\nwork with non-governmental organizations, there is a need\r\nto resist the indiscriminate pressure of unaccountable\r\nprotectionist groups that wish to sever the vital link\r\nbetween environmental protection and economic self-\r\ninterest.\r\nAlthough not yet in force, the Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling\r\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, which\r\nprovides a framework for regional cooperation in the\r\nconservation and management of these stocks, has already\r\nhad a positive impact. In the North Atlantic, for instance,\r\nfisheries-management conventions are under review in\r\norder, inter alia, to adjust them to the provisions of this\r\nAgreement. Iceland urges Member States to ratify the\r\nAgreement.\r\nAs a new member of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, Iceland welcomed the thorough discussion on\r\nfostering an enabling environment for development during\r\nthis year’s substantive session. It is of grave concern that\r\nthe gap between the rich and the poor has continued to\r\nwiden. At a time of vastly expanded trade and investment\r\nin the world, the least developed countries have seen their\r\nshare of world trade drop by half in two decades. Many\r\nof them are threatened with exclusion from world markets\r\nand economic marginalization.\r\nThe key elements for attaining sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment are a sound policy framework that\r\nencourages stable growth, a vigorous private sector, the\r\nstrengthening of institutional and legal foundations and,\r\nlast but not least, good-governance and anti-corruption\r\nmeasures. At the same time, we need to focus on human-\r\ndevelopment strategies. The strengthening of education\r\nand school systems and health and social services must be\r\nan integral part of any sound strategy for development.\r\nWe must mobilize the dynamic private sector,\r\ntogether with bilateral and multilateral official\r\ndevelopment assistance to secure sustainable growth and\r\npoverty reduction in developing countries.\r\nAs the chairman of the Nordic and the Baltic\r\nconstituency of the World Bank’s Development\r\nCommittee, I emphasize the important role of the World\r\nBank Group in development cooperation. I would like to\r\nreiterate what I stated in Hong Kong earlier this week:\r\nthat the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\r\nmust result in a permanent solution to the unsustainable\r\ndebt burden of the countries in question.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 September 1997\r\nFinally, this is a time of extraordinary challenges for\r\nthe United Nations and its Member States. This is why we\r\nneed a vigorous, strong and confident Organization, capable\r\nof leading the way into the next century. For such an\r\nOrganization to become a reality we must now focus on\r\neffective and meaningful reform. We should use the\r\nmomentum and not fritter away our time in long-winded\r\nand familiar debates. Now we have an opportunity we may\r\nnot have again any time soon.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
