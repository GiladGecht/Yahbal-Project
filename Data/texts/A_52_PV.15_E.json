(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/52/350/Add.1)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/52/350/Add.1, the Secretary-General informs the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly that, since the issuance\r\nof his communication dated 16 September 1997, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova has made the necessary payment to\r\nreduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19\r\nof the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthis information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by His Excellency The Honourable Denzil\r\nDouglas, Prime Minister and Minister for National\r\nSecurity, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Planning and\r\nInformation of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for National\r\nSecurity, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Planning and\r\nInformation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nThe Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for National Security, Foreign Affairs,\r\nFinance, Planning and Information of Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for National Security, Foreign\r\nAffairs, Finance, Planning and Information of Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Douglas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): The fifty-\r\nsecond anniversary of the United Nations is yet another\r\nhistoric moment for us all. Our shared presence here is\r\nevidence that as Members of this great institution we have\r\nan opportunity to realize our collective aspirations and\r\nexpectations. It is necessary therefore for the Organization\r\nto ensure that the concerns of Member States, particularly\r\nthose in the developing world, are not compromised or\r\nseen as secondary to the process.\r\nIt is essential that the United Nations become a\r\ncatalyst for improving the quality of life of our citizens\r\nand a champion of our fundamental rights and freedoms.\r\nSuch challenges will require much commitment and\r\nstrategic thinking. I believe that if we succeed we will\r\nhave laid the foundation for peace and international\r\nsecurity for generations to come.\r\nWith our nations and peoples standing at the\r\ncrossroads of tremendous change, and with heightened\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nexpectations in the fields of human development and\r\npoverty eradication, the United Nations must be allowed to\r\nassume an even greater role. Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nmaintains that the United Nations has the necessary\r\ninstitutional capacity to encompass our collective ambitions\r\nand simultaneously to resolve many of the problems facing\r\nnation-States.\r\nIn the light of the fundamental importance which my\r\nGovernment attaches to a reformed, more functional United\r\nNations, we welcome the appointment of His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General. His commitment to\r\nand wide experience in this institution will help provide the\r\nUnited Nations with the crucial leadership it needs at this\r\ncritical juncture in the Organization s history.\r\nAs we march into a new millennium, with its\r\nincreasing uncertainties and complexities, the United\r\nNations and its membership will have to recommit\r\nthemselves to human development in all its facets.\r\nOtherwise we will have failed in this decade to accomplish\r\nour mandate of poverty eradication.\r\nThe growing reduction in much-needed aid and\r\ntechnical assistance to the developing world threatens the\r\nfurther marginalization of our poor countries. This means\r\nthat countries will grow to depend more on the United\r\nNations. We therefore urge the United Nations to work\r\nmore closely with developing countries to devise new ideas\r\nand pragmatic approaches to improve the standard of living\r\nof the world\u0027s poor. This reality, we think, lends greater\r\nurgency to the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals for reform. In\r\nthis regard, the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nencourages wide discussion of the extensive and far-\r\nreaching reform proposals with the aim of arriving at\r\nconsensus.\r\nWe believe that it is vital to restructure and\r\nconsolidate some of the different areas of services that the\r\nUnited Nations provides. However this must herald real\r\nchange and increased benefit for Member States. We cannot\r\nsupport a mere transfer of resources from one organ to\r\nanother without proper safeguards to ensure efficiency and\r\naccountability. In the same vein, we hope that development\r\nreforms will not sacrifice the effectiveness and\r\ndistinctiveness of existing organs. In order for the\r\ndeveloping world to achieve sustainable growth, we need\r\nthe expertise, we need the resources and we need the\r\ninstitutional capabilities of existing United Nations funds\r\nand programmes.\r\nAs we work towards greater efficiency in the\r\nmanagement and administration of services, it is\r\nimportant not to undermine positive past achievements.\r\nMember States must refrain from marrying\r\nconditionalities to the process of reform, especially when\r\nthese very conditionalities hinder substantial progress in\r\nthe reform process itself. Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore\r\nsuggests that in order for reforms to work they must of\r\nnecessity balance and protect the interests of Member\r\nStates, not simply appear to reward or benefit a privileged\r\nfew. Reform is not about creating mechanisms that\r\nmerely restructure the obligations of States to the\r\nOrganization. Reform should not be used as an\r\nopportunity to compensate current economic strength.\r\nDecisions on permanent and non-permanent membership,\r\nas part of the reform process, should be the result of a\r\nprocess of debate and consensus-building.\r\nMy delegation expects to see greater emphasis on\r\ngeographic representation and on correcting old\r\ninequalities that continue to plague us today. Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis appeals to all States to be careful not to\r\nconfuse the need for genuine systemic reforms with\r\nlegally assessed financial obligations to the Organization.\r\nNations demanding reform should also be willing to\r\nreform incongruous attitudes and perceptions of the\r\nUnited Nations. We must honour all our responsibilities\r\nto the Organization. Progress will require that we all work\r\nmore closely together to confront the multitude of\r\ncomplicated problems, old and new.\r\nTo this end, let us challenge ourselves to find\r\ncommon ground and assist the United Nations in\r\ndeveloping the appropriate ideas and strategies that\r\npromote our common agenda. This may not be easy;\r\nhence the Organization will need to establish a mutually\r\nbeneficial relationship between policy makers in\r\nGovernment and the business community.\r\nOn this note, I should like to acknowledge the\r\nmagnificent contribution of Mr. Ted Turner to this\r\nOrganization. He has shown himself to be an exceptional\r\ninternational citizen. We trust that this humanitarian\r\ngesture of support for the Organization and its work will\r\nmake a noticeable impact on the areas designated, and\r\nthat it will challenge others of like mind to demonstrate\r\ntheir support for the Organization as well.\r\nThis show of support is a reminder that only the\r\nUnited Nations can provide the kind of impartial and\r\ncomprehensive leadership that Member States want. Only\r\nthe United Nations, with 50 years of successes and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nfailures as a world institution, has the unique experience to\r\ndevelop essential capabilities to serve its membership. The\r\nUnited Nations has the competitive edge. A United Nations\r\nreformed to deal with the modern challenges of a modern\r\nera can work, but only if it is allowed to work.\r\nI appreciate well the power of national imperatives and\r\nindividualism. I also understand well the concerns about\r\nsupranational institutions. Nevertheless, we have come too\r\nfar to surrender our global destiny to fear and\r\nmisconceptions.\r\nWhen we speak of the development of the human\r\nperson yet fail to appreciate that economic rights are as\r\nfundamental to human dignity as are human rights, we do\r\ngreat disservice to the cause of human rights. However,\r\nwhen we acknowledge these rights then we give more\r\nsubstance to social stability and the process of true\r\ndemocracy.\r\nDemocracy is not new to the Caribbean region. It is a\r\nway of life, a tradition for our region. We see it as the most\r\npractical and useful system of government to advance our\r\npeople. However, democracy is not simply about\r\ninstitutions or processes. It is about creating an enabling\r\ngovernment and an enabling environment in which the\r\nordinary person — the impoverished, the disillusioned, the\r\neducated and the rich — feels included and feels that he or\r\nshe can participate in the decision-making process and feels\r\nthat his or her dreams can be truly realized.\r\nBecause we regard democracy as the most efficient\r\nand viable vehicle for sustainable human development, it\r\nmust deliver and be seen to deliver. The people must be\r\nreassured that they can and indeed will rise from the\r\nquicksand of poverty through the promise of development.\r\nIf we fail to deliver on the promise, then democracy will\r\nfail. If democracy fails, poverty becomes entrenched and\r\nchaos becomes inevitable.\r\nThe condition of poverty has for too long been linked\r\nwith the destiny of small States. The apparent ease with\r\nwhich both are dismissed is a source of grave concern to\r\nthe Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nToo little attention is being paid to the economic hardships,\r\npolitical disruptions and social dislocations which we are\r\nforced to endure as small developing States. Instead of\r\nseeing crucial support from the developed world, we are\r\nwitnessing increased tendencies towards isolationism and\r\nneglect.\r\nIn the current wave of globalization, economic\r\nstability has become the soft underbelly of Caribbean\r\nsecurity, democracy and prospects for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. If these economies are not strengthened and\r\ngiven appropriate assistance, one lays waste to the\r\ntremendous intellectual talents in these countries and\r\nexposes the political and social fabric to the nefarious\r\nforces that lurk in the region.\r\nOur small countries need institutional support and\r\npartnership to help in preparing our youth to adapt their\r\nknowledge and skills to changing world circumstances.\r\nSuch preparation will help make them self-sufficient and\r\nmore responsive to the unpredictable changes taking place\r\naround us.\r\nAdditionally, we must create jobs on a continuous\r\nbasis to inspire our young people and put life\u0027s basic\r\nneeds within reach of their parents. We must not overlook\r\nthe crucial link between economic growth and long-term\r\npolitical and social stability. Sustainable development in\r\nthe Caribbean is in everyone\u0027s best interest.\r\nMy Government does not subscribe to conspiracy\r\ntheories, but it is acutely aware of the ease with which we\r\ncan all fall victim to the conspiracy of silence and the\r\nconspiracy of neglect. Our economies are under siege; our\r\nway of life is threatened; the growth of our countries and\r\npeople is undermined by forces which are better able to\r\nexploit globalization and trade liberalization.\r\nNo one in good faith can accuse us of complacency.\r\nOur countries have worked hard to keep pace with current\r\neconomic trends. We have tightened fiscal and monetary\r\npolicies, and we are monitoring them very closely. We\r\nhave run the gauntlet of social and economic measures\r\nsupposedly structured to ensure the economic growth and\r\nsurvival of our various economies.\r\nThe road we have travelled has been a difficult one,\r\nand we have learned valuable lessons. Still, we continue\r\nto suffer exclusion from developed countries\u0027 markets for\r\nour various products. As a direct consequence, the private\r\nsector has become sceptical of its very survival and\r\nprofitability.\r\nOur banana-producing countries in the region have\r\nsuffered a tremendous and potentially devastating blow in\r\nthe wake of the recent panel ruling of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WT0) on the banana regime of the African,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific group of States (ACP). It is\r\ninconceivable that the insignificant but important\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\npercentage in access that ACP countries share in this\r\nmarket can pose any meaningful threat to the collaborative\r\ninterests of multinational producers.\r\nOur banana and sugar industries are major employers\r\nand foreign exchange earners; yet, without regard for our\r\nsurvival, they are being challenged with the ultimate\r\nobjective of dismantling them completely. At the same\r\ntime, we still do not have ready access to essential\r\ntechnologies vital to making our industries and human\r\nresources more competitive and more efficient.\r\nWe contend that trade liberalization, without the\r\nproper mechanisms to protect the small and the weak, does\r\nnot promote fair trade. Where is the fairness of fair trade?\r\nHow, therefore, will our small island developing States find\r\nnew and sustainable ways to respond to the growing needs\r\nof our population? How will we be able to stem the brain\r\ndrain, the migration of human resources searching for a\r\nbetter standard of living?\r\nOur countries have undertaken to diversify our\r\neconomies despite the obvious dislocations within our\r\nsocieties. We remain committed to democratic institutions,\r\nand we continuously allocate scarce resources to human\r\ndevelopment. Our Governments in the Caribbean have been\r\nworking more closely with the private sector as true\r\npartners in development. We have enacted legislation to\r\nfacilitate increased investment opportunities and to\r\nencourage foreign direct investment and domestic savings.\r\nNonetheless, with every step we seem to fall prey to\r\nthe perpetual and constantly evolving demands for more\r\nextensive changes without any regard for the effects on our\r\ncountries and our people. Globalization, with its insatiable\r\nappetite, and the ravenous forces of unrestricted free market\r\nand trade liberalization are forever famished. Why must the\r\nrules which are always in a state of constant flux be to the\r\ndetriment of small resource-poor States?\r\nIn the coming years, not only will we still be\r\nstruggling to combat poverty, but the concepts of\r\nsovereignty and governance will also be seriously\r\nchallenged as we endeavour to cope with the complex\r\nimplications of forces that face our societies and menace\r\nour democracies. The transnational nature of information,\r\nof capital, of labour and of technological advances will not\r\nspare our tiny countries the trying consequences unleashed\r\nby globalization.\r\nDespite these difficulties, Saint Kitts and Nevis will\r\nnot become a nation of mendicants. We will give priority\r\nto the right of our citizens to economic well-being. For\r\nwhat good would it do if our people achieve their human\r\nright to exist but are denied the right to live dignified\r\nlives?\r\nThe Labour Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nhas undertaken to build 1,000 new, affordable homes by\r\nthe end of this century. We believe that all our citizens\r\nhave the right to live in dignity and to have access to the\r\nbasic necessities of life. We have already turned over 100\r\nnew houses, and by the end of this year we expect 300\r\nfamilies to be moving into new homes in Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis. This is the commitment of the Government of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis to the development of its citizens.\r\nI have said in the past, and I maintain now, that we\r\nmust abandon the practice of using gross national product\r\nper capita to measure standards of living for people in the\r\ndeveloping world. How can the developed world and\r\nmultilateral agencies deny assistance to countries on the\r\nbasis that such a country has reached this artificial\r\nthreshold? Are people in the developing world not entitled\r\nto a higher standard of living, or must they always\r\nstraddle the boundaries of poverty and exist only at levels\r\nwhich the developed world considers acceptable indicators\r\nof human progress?\r\nIt is important for us to dedicate our energies to the\r\nlogic of prevention. In Saint Kitts and Nevis we believe\r\nstrongly that prevention is better than cure. We believe in\r\nenabling our peoples to have a life free of poverty and\r\ndespair. The Secretary-General has called for greater\r\nefficiency in management, greater resource mobilization\r\nand redeployment of potential savings to the development\r\nfields. This is long overdue.\r\nIt is also the duty of Member States to ensure that\r\nnew resources are targeted at development. Such a\r\nprocess will have to be guided by and nourished with\r\nvision, political will and an appreciation of the global\r\nimperatives of sustainable development and poverty\r\neradication. It will involve foresight, profound analyses,\r\nand a willingness to look beyond national self-interest.\r\nWorking together to shape our collective destiny could\r\nenable us to reduce the risks of future political and social\r\nconflicts.\r\nI believe firmly that the special circumstances and\r\nvulnerability indices of small States must be at the\r\nforefront of international debate. If there were ever a\r\nquestion as to the vulnerability of small States, I\r\nchallenge the Assembly to recall the unfortunate situation\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\non the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This reality clearly\r\ndemonstrates that it takes only one disaster, only one\r\nviolent act of nature, only one volcanic eruption to dislocate\r\nan entire population, decimate an entire economy and\r\ndestroy the entire social fabric of a people. The\r\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis, like other Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM) countries, has extended a willing\r\nhand of health and social support to the people of\r\nMontserrat. We continue to provide employment and other\r\nbusiness opportunities to those who have come to our\r\nshores in Saint Kitts and Nevis from the island of\r\nMontserrat. I urge the international community to join the\r\nCaribbean in taking prompt, decisive and tangible steps to\r\nassist the people of Montserrat.\r\nMontserrat is a microcosm of our precarious existence.\r\nHence, we urge the international community to fulfil its\r\npromises under the Barbados Programme of Action and\r\nother commitments to the developing world. Our survival\r\nas a region is intimately interwoven with our environment,\r\nand our physical and economic limitations should not be\r\nfurther burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste\r\nthrough our waterways. Such actions are a flagrant violation\r\nof our human rights and an affront to our sovereign dignity.\r\nAs we work to fulfil the dreams of those who came\r\nbefore us, I trust that we will succeed in developing\r\nconfidence in the capabilities of the United Nations and\r\nentrust it with realizing our common objectives. At the\r\nsame time, there will be occasions when we must challenge\r\nourselves to appreciate that some problems in international\r\naffairs require indigenous approaches and remedies. We\r\nmust, therefore, yield to such imperatives.\r\nOne case in point is the Middle East, where the\r\ncurrent crisis calls for a nurturing of mutual trust and a\r\nclear willingness to understand the need for all the parties\r\nto come to the bargaining table. Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nbelieves that durable peace and security are the common\r\ndesires of the nations involved. Success requires boldness\r\nand commitment. Genuine progress will come not from\r\nviolence, recrimination and mistrust, but through partnership\r\nand dialogue. Saint Kitts and Nevis urges both sides to use\r\nnegotiation and creative confidence-building measures in\r\naddressing their differences\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis also urges the Chinese people on\r\nboth sides of the Taiwan Strait to commit their collective\r\nenergies to the pursuit of common approaches to resolving\r\nthe current impasse that divides them. The Government of\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis maintains that progress on this issue\r\nrequires sustained dialogue, political will and the goodwill\r\nof all. We also believe that the remarkable strides the\r\nChinese people on Taiwan have made in the last two\r\ndecades should not be squandered. The international\r\ncommunity can benefit, and stands to benefit significantly,\r\nfrom the economic, technological and social advances of\r\nTaiwan.\r\nIn conclusion, fulfilling the expectations of our\r\ncitizens is not a simple task, but we cannot and must not\r\nbecome discouraged. I hope, therefore, that as we\r\nendeavour to accomplish our goals Member States will\r\nnot continue to make unreasonable demands on this\r\nOrganization while refusing it the requisite tools and\r\nresources for appropriate action. Our world needs a\r\nstronger United Nations. Our countries and our peoples\r\nneed its intellectual supervision and potential for\r\nimpartiality. Let us not try to relegate it to the periphery,\r\nlest we risk serious consequences in the future. Let us\r\ncommit to writing a history of which we can be proud,\r\nlest history should hold us in contempt for squandering\r\nour children\u0027s heritage. Let this session of the General\r\nAssembly be a watershed when collective efforts were\r\ntranslated into appropriate action and well-deserved\r\nresults.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nNational Security, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Planning and\r\nInformation of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nThe Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for National Security, Foreign Affairs,\r\nFinance, Planning and Information of Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nChong Ha Yoo, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nMr. Yoo (Republic of Korea): I congratulate you,\r\nSir, on assuming the presidency of the fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly and pledge to you our\r\nfull support and cooperation. I also pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, whose devoted\r\nefforts enabled the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly to come to grips with some of the core issues\r\naffecting the future of the United Nations.\r\nWe meet at a time when a number of profound\r\nquestions loom large over humankind. Does the\r\ninternational community possess the necessary will and\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nmeans to make the twenty-first century an era of wider\r\npeace, deeper justice and greater prosperity? Can we\r\neradicate poverty and protect the environment? Are we able\r\nto ensure that fundamental human rights are respected and\r\npromoted throughout the world? Can we reinvigorate the\r\nUnited Nations so that it can be the means to advance these\r\nends? To each of these questions we can and must respond\r\nin the affirmative.\r\nThe Secretary-General, through his recent reform\r\nproposals, has provided the international community with\r\na timely compass to help guide the way. In the view of my\r\ndelegation, the Secretary- General\u0027s latest proposals contain\r\na wide spectrum of reforms designed for the overall\r\nenhancement of the United Nations system. We are\r\nconfident that many of the Secretary-General\u0027s ideas can be\r\ntranslated into action through open-minded deliberation,\r\nwith the full participation of Member States at this session.\r\nIn this respect, I wish to recall the statement of 10 August\r\nby the Group of 16, including the Republic of Korea, which\r\nexpressed support for the Secretary-General\u0027s reform\r\ninitiatives.\r\nWhile institutional reform is a prerequisite for a more\r\nefficient United Nations, it is clear that without more\r\nreliable financial support the Organization cannot make an\r\nefficient transition into the twenty-first century. Only when\r\nMember States discharge their financial obligations in full,\r\non time and without conditions will the United Nations\r\nsafely and smoothly reach its ultimate destination of\r\nensuring a better future for humankind.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Korea has made it a firm policy\r\nto pay its assessed dues in full and on time. We will\r\nactively participate in concerted efforts to adopt a more\r\nequitable scale of assessment at this session. My\r\nGovernment will consider a gradual move from the\r\ncontributors\u0027 Group C to which Korea presently belongs, to\r\nGroup B in terms of peacekeeping assessment. This is a\r\nreaffirmation of our enduring commitment towards both the\r\nfinancial viability of the United Nations and its efforts to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nAnother crucial task before us is the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. At the last session, my delegation actively\r\nparticipated in deliberations on the issue, on the basis of\r\nour own experiences as a Council member. We share the\r\nview that the profound changes in international relations\r\nover the past several decades fully warrant expansion of\r\nCouncil membership. Given the diverse and sensitive\r\nconcerns of all Member States, however, this issue must be\r\nhandled with the utmost prudence and seriousness. Every\r\neffort should be made to work out a consensus formula,\r\nwhile bearing in mind that haste makes waste.\r\nOne of the most significant and promising\r\ndevelopments in international relations over the past half\r\ncentury has been the emergence of a considerable number\r\nof medium-power countries with the capability to make a\r\nmeaningful contribution to the cause of international\r\npeace and security. Any plan to reform the Council\r\nshould provide those countries with opportunities to serve\r\non the Council with reasonable frequency, commensurate\r\nwith their capabilities and contributions.\r\nWe also believe that Council reform should be based\r\nupon consideration of the problems and shortcomings\r\nassociated with the Council\u0027s operations thus far,\r\nparticularly with respect to the system of permanent\r\nmembership and the right of veto. Convinced that more\r\ncan be done to make the Security Council a more\r\nrepresentative, efficient and democratic body, we will\r\nremain open-minded and flexible with regard to any\r\nproposals that can move this important process in the\r\nright direction.\r\nAs a member of the Security Council for the 1996-\r\n1997 period, the Republic of Korea has made its due\r\ncontribution to the cause of international peace and\r\nsecurity. We have actively participated in reaching\r\nimportant decisions to enhance peace and stability in the\r\ncountries of some parts of the third world that have been\r\nplagued by civil conflicts over the past several years. We\r\nalso organized, during Korea\u0027s presidency of the Council\r\nlast May, an open debate on the refugee issue. The debate\r\nresulted in the adoption of a presidential statement in June\r\non protection for humanitarian assistance to refugees and\r\nothers in conflict situations. This clearly reflects the fact\r\nthat the Security Council has come to recognize that\r\nsecurity applies to people as much as to States in an era\r\nof intra-State conflicts.\r\nDespite many positive developments in the security\r\nlandscape of the post Cold-War era, the non-proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction remains a priority concern\r\nto people and Governments alike. My Government\r\nbelieves that universal adherence to the existing non-\r\nproliferation regimes represents an essential step towards\r\nrealizing that common objective. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention, and urge those States which have not yet\r\nacceded to the Convention, including North Korea, to do\r\nso at the earliest date.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nThe proliferation and indiscriminate use of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines has been the cause of enormous\r\nhuman suffering and injury, particularly among civilians.\r\nGiven the magnitude of the scourge of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, the Republic of Korea has decided to extend for\r\nan indefinite period its moratorium on the export of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, which was to expire at the end of this\r\nyear. We believe, however, that each country\u0027s legitimate\r\nsecurity concerns should be given due consideration in\r\naddressing this matter.\r\nI wish to reiterate that, while we fully support the\r\nnoble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, a sweeping ban cannot be a\r\nsatisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of\r\nKorea, which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence\r\nof all-out war, and whose heavily populated capital is only\r\n25 miles from the military demarcation line. In our view,\r\nthe draft convention adopted in Oslo two weeks ago does\r\nnot fully accommodate concerns which we have\r\nconsistently expressed, or the exceptional nature of the\r\nsecurity situation on the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe international community has consistently\r\nendeavoured to wipe out all forms of terrorism from the\r\nface of the earth. However, terrorism still persists as one of\r\nthe major threats to international peace, exacting a heavy\r\ntoll on innocent lives. The Republic of Korea has\r\nexperienced many barbaric and cowardly acts of terrorism\r\nand still lives under its constant threat, including recent\r\nopen threats aimed at our free press. We strongly support\r\ninternational efforts to combat terrorism and underline the\r\nimportance of upholding the principle of zero tolerance.\r\nGiven the global spectrum of terrorism, we also believe that\r\nthe United Nations can play a central role in strengthening\r\nthe international anti-terrorism regime. In this regard, we\r\nlook forward to an early adoption of the convention for the\r\nsuppression of terrorist bombings.\r\nIn this era of interdependence among States, the\r\ninternational community cannot remain indifferent to the\r\nunder-development of much of the world. My delegation\r\ntherefore welcomes the adoption of the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment at the previous session of the General\r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General\u0027s reform proposals\r\ndesigned to enhance the United Nations economic and\r\nsocial initiatives as well as its development activities. For\r\nthat reason, we support the Secretary-General\u0027s suggestion\r\nto enhance the coordinating role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and to strengthen cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. We\r\nexpect that the various proposals for a funding modality for\r\nUnited Nations development activities will be discussed\r\nfully at this session.\r\nKorea, now a member of the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, will participate\r\nmore vigorously in South-South cooperation projects with\r\na view to playing a bridging role between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. In an effort to expand assistance to\r\nthe least developed countries, we have participated in\r\nbilateral cooperation projects with the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa since 1995, and we plan to\r\nundertake a programme for the development of Africa for\r\nthe period 1998 to 2000.\r\nMy Government, jointly with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, established in Seoul this past\r\nMay the International Vaccine Institute. This Institute is\r\ndevoted to the research and development of vaccines for\r\nchildren around the world, particularly those in\r\ndeveloping countries. The inaugural meeting of its board\r\nof trustees is scheduled to convene in Seoul next month.\r\nWe look forward to generous support from Member\r\nStates for this worthy goal of keeping our children free\r\nfrom debilitating diseases.\r\nTurning now to environmental issues, my\r\nGovernment welcomes the adoption of the Programme for\r\nFurther Implementation of Agenda 21 at the nineteenth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly and stands\r\ncommitted to participating faithfully in its implementation.\r\nIn particular, we are pleased that Korea\u0027s proposal to\r\nconduct a feasibility study on the transfer of publicly\r\nowned technology was supported by developed and\r\ndeveloping countries alike and was included in the\r\nProgramme. The results of the feasibility study, which is\r\nbeing funded by my Government, will be presented at the\r\nsixth session of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment next April. Through these efforts, we hope\r\nto expedite the transfer of environmentally sound\r\ntechnologies and to promote international cooperation for\r\nenvironmental protection.\r\nDuring the special session, there was also an in-\r\ndepth discussion on the safe management of radioactive\r\nwaste, an issue of serious concern to many countries. My\r\nGovernment attaches great importance to the fact that the\r\nspecial session adopted a comprehensive set of\r\narrangements on the environmentally sound management\r\nof these dangerous wastes. We strongly urge that these\r\narrangements be firmly and strictly adhered to and\r\nrespected.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nWith regard to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, we hope that a realistic and\r\nachievable outcome will emerge at the Kyoto Conference\r\nto be held in December this year.\r\nNext year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption and proclamation of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. In 1998, we are also to undertake the five-\r\nyear mid-term review of the implementation of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action adopted in June\r\n1993.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, human rights is an area\r\nwhere the United Nations has made significant contributions\r\nover the past half century, not just as an international forum\r\nfor discussion, but also as a centre for coordinated action.\r\nSeen from this perspective, the consolidation of the Office\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\r\nCentre for Human Rights, as proposed in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report, should certainly inject new vitality into\r\nUnited Nations efforts to enhance the coordination of its\r\nactivities in the area of human rights. I wholeheartedly\r\nwelcome Mary Robinson\u0027s assumption of the post of High\r\nCommissioner.\r\nMy Government also welcomes the remarkable\r\nprogress made by the Preparatory Committee on the\r\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court, which we\r\nbelieve will serve as an effective deterrent against violations\r\nof international humanitarian law. We expect that the\r\nforthcoming conference in Rome will adopt the statute of\r\nthe court, paving the way for its establishment at the\r\nearliest possible date. From a historical perspective, the\r\ncreation of a permanent international criminal court will set\r\na benchmark for the attainment of international criminal\r\njustice in the coming century.\r\nAs rightly pointed out in the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport, the developments in the present decade have clearly\r\nstrengthened the argument that respect for human rights is\r\na precondition for political stability and socio-economic\r\nprogress. One of the United Nations\u0027 most compelling\r\nresponsibilities is to further promote universal respect for\r\nhuman rights and deter gross human rights abuses and\r\npolitical oppression. In this context, we are gravely\r\nconcerned at the dire human rights situation in North\r\nKorea. We truly hope that, in the not-too-distant future, our\r\ncompatriots in the North will come to enjoy basic human\r\nrights and freedoms, as other peoples do around the world.\r\nLet me now turn to the situation on the Korean\r\nPeninsula. In April last year, the Republic of Korea and the\r\nUnited States jointly proposed four-party talks, involving\r\nthe South and the North of Korea, the United States and\r\nChina, which aim to establish a permanent peace\r\nmechanism on the Korean Peninsula and build mutual\r\ntrust between the two sides of Korea. The four-party\r\ntalks, when realized, will offer rare chances of facilitating\r\npeace and security on the Korean Peninsula and\r\nthroughout North-east Asia.\r\nIf inter-Korean relations are to move forward and the\r\noutstanding problems of the Peninsula are to be resolved\r\npeacefully, there is no alternative to dialogue and\r\nreconciliation between the South and the North of Korea.\r\nWe sincerely hope that North Korea will realize the\r\nimportance and value of improved inter-Korean relations\r\nthrough its participation in the four-party talks. While the\r\ntalks are in the interest of all concerned, no one stands to\r\nbenefit more than North Korea itself. The construction of\r\na solid and durable peace structure on the Korean\r\nPeninsula will also produce generous dividends which can\r\nhelp North Korea in addressing a host of domestic\r\nchallenges it faces, including its economic difficulties.\r\nIt is regrettable that the recent preparatory meetings\r\nfor the four-party talks ended without any tangible result.\r\nNevertheless, we will continue our patient effort to\r\nengage North Korea in a process of dialogue. We\r\nappreciate the continued support of the international\r\ncommunity to this end.\r\nIn the meantime, the Republic of Korea will\r\ncontinue to provide humanitarian assistance to North\r\nKorea. The plight of innocent civilians in the North and,\r\nin particular, vulnerable groups such as malnourished\r\nchildren, is a matter of serious concern for the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Korea. As a\r\nmatter of priority, my Government will provide assistance\r\nto the vulnerable children in North Korea in close\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund and\r\nother interested countries. In this connection, we would\r\nlike to stress the vital importance of transparency in the\r\ndistribution process. We hope that such transparency can\r\nbe enhanced through more effective monitoring by the\r\ninternational organizations concerned.\r\nThis year has seen some positive developments in\r\ninternational efforts to resolve the long-standing North\r\nKorean nuclear issue. The 1994 Geneva Agreed\r\nFramework has now entered the implementation stage,\r\nwith the ground-breaking ceremony for the light-water\r\nreactor project in North Korea last month under the\r\nauspices of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nOrganization (KEDO). For the first time in nearly five\r\ndecades, over 100 engineers and technicians of both sides\r\nof Korea are working together on the construction site. We\r\nhope that this welcome development will be a harbinger of\r\na new era in inter-Korean relations. My Government takes\r\nthis opportunity to express its appreciation to all those\r\ncountries which have extended generous financial\r\ncontributions to KEDO.\r\nWhile the ongoing light-water reactor project\r\nundertaken by KEDO is an important step forward in\r\neliminating the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Korean\r\npeninsula, it must be emphasized here once again that the\r\nultimate resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue is\r\npossible only when North Korea complies fully with its\r\nsafeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency, as well as with the Joint Declaration on the\r\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula signed by the\r\nSouth and North Korea in 1991.\r\nWhen the United Nations was founded in 1945, who\r\ncould have foreseen the extent to which international\r\nrelations would develop during the next half-century? No\r\ndoubt, a number of geopolitical structural changes will\r\noccur in the coming century as well.\r\nAt the threshold of the twenty-first century, this\r\nsession of the General Assembly could well prove to be a\r\nturning point by providing a forum for reconfiguring the\r\narchitecture and priorities of the Organization. Facing a new\r\narray of challenges, this session should point the way\r\ntowards a brighter future and a renewed sense of optimism.\r\nTogether, we can forge a stronger United Nations and,\r\nthrough it, the foundation for a century of peace, prosperity\r\nand justice. The Republic of Korea stands ready to do its\r\ndue part.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Singapore, His Excellency Mr. S.\r\nJayakumar.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): Let me congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly. I also thank our\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his untiring\r\nefforts. He catalysed a change in our approach to Security\r\nCouncil reform and set a new trajectory for it.\r\nFor several years, we have all recognized the\r\nimperative of United Nations reform. Today, the issue of\r\nthe moment is still reform. This summer, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral challenged us with a package of reforms that he\r\naccurately described as the most extensive and far-\r\nreaching in the 52-year history of this Organization. This\r\nis, of course, not the first time a Secretary-General has\r\nattempted to remake this Organization. But now that the\r\nmore extravagant of post-cold-war hopes for the United\r\nNations have faded, I believe that this package represents\r\na more focused, realistic and practical approach. We\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s objective clearly is to enable\r\nthe United Nations to do better what we all require it to\r\ndo. We all take the United Nations importance as\r\naxiomatic. Therefore, his intention to reconfigure the\r\nUnited Nations management and strengthen the United\r\nNations ability to perform its core functions should be\r\ngenerally acceptable to the majority, even if every\r\nparticular element of his proposals has not been fully\r\nelaborated or may not be entirely to everyone\u0027s taste.\r\nIn the larger interests of this Organization, we should\r\nall welcome the thrust of the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nproposals and not take issue with too many details.\r\nSingapore adopts such an approach. We have, for\r\nexample, questions about some specific details of his\r\nproposals to place the United Nations finances on a\r\nsounder footing and to streamline its operations. But we\r\nhave nonetheless contributed actively to the effort to\r\nstreamline budgetary and administrative procedures in the\r\nSecretariat and will continue to do so.\r\nBy taking a pragmatic and eclectic approach, we\r\nhope to help move the reform process forward, even if we\r\nmay have questions on specific aspects. We will continue\r\nto work with the Secretary-General and other Member\r\nStates to make the United Nations a more efficient and\r\neffective Organization — one that will serve the interests\r\nof all its Members, big and small, developing as well as\r\nindustrialized.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s proposals on the United\r\nNations management, administration and structure have\r\nsometimes been directly or indirectly linked to the\r\nongoing effort by Member States to prepare the United\r\nNations political leadership for the twenty-first century\r\nthrough Security Council reform. We are not confident\r\nthat this is the correct approach. We have been engaged\r\nin this broader effort for almost four years. It is a fact\r\nthat the process has been difficult. Progress has been\r\nslow. We have reached the conclusion that the prospects\r\nfor further progress are not good.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nWe have arrived at this conclusion with great\r\nreluctance and without rancour. Progress has not been slow\r\nbecause of the ill will of one State or another. Prospects for\r\nfurther progress are dim not merely because one country or\r\nanother has lacked the will to cut through the web of vested\r\ninterests. The reasons are more fundamental. They go\r\nbeyond the volitions and intentions of individual countries\r\nand are embedded in the nature and inescapable realities of\r\ninternational organization in an international system that is\r\nstill largely defined by relations between sovereign States.\r\nNo great Power, or even a Power with aspirations to\r\ngreatness, has ever been willing to submit its own vital\r\ninterests to United Nations jurisdiction. This fact of\r\ninternational life underlies the current reform stalemate. The\r\nnecessity of United Nations reform may be widely\r\naccepted. But what the great Powers want is not a strong\r\nUnited Nations per se. They want a United Nations just\r\nstrong and credible enough to serve as an effective\r\ninstrument of their will and policies. It is only small\r\ncountries that are more inclined to take the United Nations\r\non its own terms and in its own right. Small countries are\r\nnot necessarily more virtuous — we merely have fewer\r\noptions.\r\nThis reality has been underscored by our discussions\r\non Security Council reform. The really crucial decisions\r\nthat will allow Security Council reform to move decisively\r\nforward or stall it indefinitely are going to be taken in\r\nWashington, London, Paris, Beijing or Moscow. It has not\r\nbeen clear that the current permanent members really want\r\nchange except on their own terms and in circumstances that\r\nwill not erode their current status and prerogatives. Critical\r\nambiguities in their positions have held up progress and\r\nwill continue to do so unless clarified.\r\nOne school of thought is that we should decide on\r\nSecurity Council reform during this General Assembly. I\r\ncan well sympathize with the frustrations of those who feel\r\nthat the current debate is going nowhere. But precisely\r\nbecause this is so, we need to ask: What is it that we are\r\ngoing to decide upon? The answer is far from clear. Indeed,\r\nthe entire Security Council reform process is in danger of\r\nbeing lost in a wilderness of logical contradictions and\r\nambiguities. Please permit me to spell out some of these\r\ncontradictions and ambiguities.\r\nSeveral permanent members have been categoric only\r\nin their desire to see Japan and Germany as new permanent\r\nmembers. Many other countries, including my own, would\r\nagree that, when general agreement is reached on the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council, Japan and Germany\r\nshould be new permanent members. But an equally large\r\nnumber of countries, and I believe Japan and Germany\r\nare among them, would also agree that any general\r\nagreement on expansion must include some developing\r\ncountries as new permanent members to reflect new\r\ninternational realities.\r\nOn this point most permanent members have been\r\nfar less clear. When challenged, several of them have\r\nrecently for the first time conceded that in addition to\r\nJapan and Germany they would in principle be willing to\r\naccept three permanent seats for developing nations from\r\nthe regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. This is\r\nwelcome progress. Nevertheless, important ambiguities\r\nstill remain.\r\nHow will the three developing countries be chosen?\r\nIt has been suggested that individual countries be chosen\r\nby a two-thirds vote of the membership as a whole. It has\r\nalso been suggested that they could be subject to some\r\nsystem of rotation within the regions.\r\nBoth, however, are problematic concepts. Can a\r\ncountry really legitimately represent a region if it is\r\nchosen outside the region? Will the two-thirds\r\nmembership prescribed by the Charter really be\r\nsufficiently familiar with conditions outside their own\r\nrespective regions to make an informed and legitimate\r\nchoice, binding on regions of which they are not\r\nmembers? Then, conceptually, is it not inherently\r\ncontradictory for a member to be said to be permanent\r\nbut nonetheless be subject to rotation? Who will such a\r\nmember represent: its own national interests or the\r\nregion\u0027s interests? Can it really represent the latter?\r\nIndeed, what is the regional interest? How will it be\r\ndetermined? Is the regional interest necessarily\r\nsynonymous with the interests of the larger members of\r\na region? Can a rotational system work for any region\r\nexcept Africa, where it is already an established\r\nprinciple?\r\nNone of these questions will be easy to answer.\r\nThey have been debated for the last three years without\r\nsatisfactory answers. But unless there are clear answers,\r\nmy concern is that suggestions for a differentiated\r\nselection process for permanent members from among the\r\nnewly industrialized and newly developing countries will\r\nonly lead to permanent stress, divisions and conflict for\r\nmost regions, or it will lead to a two-stage decision-\r\nmaking process where the elevation of Germany and\r\nJapan will not for many years, if ever, be matched by any\r\ndegree of consensus for the developing nations of Asia,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nAfrica and Latin America. Such a discriminatory situation\r\nwould be clearly unacceptable to a majority of Member\r\nStates, including many of those that aspire to permanent\r\nstatus.\r\nBut even if we could simultaneously reach agreement\r\non the identity of the three permanent members from\r\namong the developing countries, together with Japan and\r\nGermany, there are further complexities of equal\r\nimportance. What will be the status of the new permanent\r\nmembers?\r\nEven those current permanent members that have\r\nstrongly supported Germany\u0027s and Japan\u0027s aspirations have\r\nbeen silent on whether Germany and Japan should have the\r\nveto. Even treaty allies of Japan and Germany, countries\r\nthat have pledged to go to war at their side and for them,\r\nhave taken no position on this crucial question. This, in our\r\nview, makes it even more difficult to believe that any\r\ndeveloped country permanent member would ever allow\r\nany developing country to acquire the veto, even though\r\nthey have made it clear that they want to retain unrestricted\r\nuse of the veto for themselves.\r\nThe powers of new permanent members are not\r\nquestions that can be deferred to a later date merely to\r\nmake it easier to quickly determine the identity of the new\r\npermanent members. They are intrinsic to the very notion\r\nand definition of permanent membership. Is a new\r\npermanent member really a permanent member if it does\r\nnot have the same powers as the original five permanent\r\nmembers?\r\nArticle 27 has been controversial from the very\r\nfounding of the United Nations. There is now a wide\r\nconsensus that the use of the veto should be curtailed with\r\na view to its eventual abolition. The reality, of course, is\r\nthat this is not going to happen any time soon. Any attempt\r\nto curtail the veto will be vetoed. Undemocratic though it\r\nmay be, the veto will be with us for the foreseeable future.\r\nAnd it is not without a certain utility in so far as it helps\r\nprevent conflicts among the major Powers which could\r\nundermine the United Nations. It has been argued that the\r\nveto acts as a fail-safe mechanism. The veto will prevent\r\nthose countries that are so essential to the maintenance of\r\npeace and security and to the operation of the United\r\nNations that they deserve permanent status from being\r\ncompelled to take any action that would lead to conflicts\r\namong themselves.\r\nNow, if this justification for the retention of the veto\r\nby the original five permanent members has any validity,\r\nthen the question that arises is whether any new\r\npermanent member that is not given the veto is really\r\ndeserving of that status? Would such countries really\r\nenjoy the international stature and the capability and clout\r\nto make such a crucial contribution to international peace\r\nand security as to warrant being given permanent status?\r\nAnd if not, why give them permanent status? Could they\r\nnot make financial and other contributions to the United\r\nNations in some other, way as many countries with no\r\nsuch aspirations already do? If there is a need for new\r\npermanent members, and I believe there is a need, then\r\nthe veto is not a question that can be postponed or\r\ndiscussed separately from the issue of their identities.\r\nThree out of the five current permanent members\r\nhave also been adamantly opposed to the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council beyond a total of 20 or 21 members.\r\nThis effectively blocks any expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nLet us suppose that agreement is reached on the\r\nidentity of the five new permanent members: Japan and\r\nGermany and three from the developing countries,\r\nwhichever they may be. But if the current permanent\r\nmembers that argue against an expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil beyond 21 members remain firm in their position,\r\nthis would mean only one additional non-permanent seat\r\nfor the 165 remaining members of the United Nations, all\r\nof which have a desire and a right to serve the United\r\nNations on the Security Council at least occasionally. This\r\ninequitable arrangement would certainly be rejected by\r\nthe majority. Moreover, creating five new permanent\r\nmembers in a Security Council of 21 will seriously upset\r\nthe present balance between permanent seats and non-\r\npermanent seats. This is also a situation which will not be\r\nacceptable to the majority of the Member States. It will\r\ncertainly not command the support of the two thirds of\r\nthe membership required by the Charter to effect any\r\nchange to the Security Council\u0027s present composition.\r\nThose that have argued for an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council to no more than 21 members have done\r\nso on the grounds that this is the maximum number that\r\ncan function effectively and efficiently. These are\r\nconcerns that we should all share. Nobody wants an\r\nineffective or inefficient Security Council. But no one has\r\nyet made a convincing argument that a Security Council\r\nof, say, 26 members, as has been proposed by the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, would be any less efficient or\r\neffective than a Security Council of 21. This is of course\r\nassuming that effectiveness and efficiency are not\r\nnarrowly defined as merely making it more difficult for\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nany of the current permanent members and their allies to\r\nensure that nobody can prevent them from having their own\r\nway.\r\nIn any case, can we really decide on the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of an expanded Security Council before we\r\nknow what the powers of the new permanent members are\r\ngoing to be? This leads us into a tautological situation. We\r\ncannot know how an expanded Security Council consisting\r\nof an expanded number of permanent members will operate\r\nbecause, as I argued a moment ago, the definition of what\r\nconstitutes a new permanent member cannot be separated\r\nfrom the question of the veto. And the current permanent\r\nmembers have refused to pronounce on this. At this point,\r\neffectiveness and efficiency as an argument against a\r\nSecurity Council of more than 21 breaks down completely.\r\nI could go on with my analysis. But I hope I have\r\ndemonstrated that several critical aspects of the positions of\r\nthe major countries on Security Council reform need further\r\nclarification before progress can be made. I do not believe\r\nthat the ambiguities and contradictions are going to be\r\nresolved soon. They are the natural consequence of\r\nsovereign States pursuing their national interests.\r\nThe position of permanent members will have a\r\ndecisive influence on whether or not Security Council\r\nreform moves forward. As things presently stand, it seems\r\nclear that what will not evoke a veto from any of the\r\ncurrent permanent members will not command the support\r\nof the two-thirds membership required to make the\r\nnecessary Charter changes. At the same time, what would\r\nattract the support of the vast majority of United Nations\r\nMembers is more likely than not to provoke a veto. This is\r\nwhere, like it or not, we currently stand.\r\nA similar case could be made on the closely related\r\nquestion of financial reform. This too, has its own deep\r\ncomplexities; its own intrinsic contradictions between what\r\nwould be acceptable to the majority and what the major\r\nPowers want. Not every change is necessarily for the better.\r\nWe should therefore make progress cautiously, especially\r\non such fundamental questions. This is why the Non-\r\nAligned Movement has wisely decided that efforts at\r\nrestructuring the Security Council should not be subject to\r\nany imposed time-frame.\r\nOf course, there has been an evolution in the positions\r\nof the major Powers over the last four years. There will be\r\nfurther positive changes over time. But it will certainly take\r\ntime. No country readily changes the status quo if it\r\nbenefits from the status quo.\r\nMy point is therefore that, given this reality, it\r\nwould be a historic mistake to artificially link the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s managerial, administrative and\r\nstructural reforms to far more contentious questions of\r\nSecurity Council or other matters that would require the\r\nsupport of the two-thirds membership needed to effect\r\nCharter amendments as defined in Article 108. There is\r\nno need to handicap ourselves in this way. Not all aspects\r\nof the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals are equally\r\nacceptable to all Members. But, taken as a whole, it will\r\nbe far easier to reach a general agreement on more\r\naspects of the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals if they are\r\nconsidered in themselves and not linked to more\r\npoliticized and therefore more intractable questions.\r\nThis is not to say that Security Council or financial\r\nreforms are unimportant. Of course, they are important.\r\nWe should continue to work on them. The issues I have\r\nraised are complex. But there is no avoiding them. I\r\nremain confident that with patience and sincerity we will\r\neventually find our way out of the thickets of ambiguity\r\ninto which we have wandered. I am confident that we will\r\neventually succeed in our common endeavour to enhance\r\nthe ability of the Security Council to exercise leadership\r\nin the management of global affairs and enhance its\r\nlegitimacy to do so.\r\nBut this is only one facet of United Nations reform.\r\nThe Security Council is not necessarily the only United\r\nNations body that is important, nor even always the most\r\nimportant. The Security Council is empowered to act on\r\nbehalf of the membership as a whole on questions of\r\ninternational peace and security. It has no direct mandate\r\nto act on behalf of the membership as a whole on many\r\nother urgent international questions. International peace\r\nand security are no longer the only definition of high\r\ninternational politics. Development and the environment\r\nare two areas that are obvious and of increasing\r\nimportance. Such issues in which the Security Council is\r\nnot the lead United Nations body have risen in\r\nprominence on the post-cold-war international agenda.\r\nThey will remain high priorities for the majority. There\r\ncan be no legitimate leadership role for the United\r\nNations that does not deal with such issues.\r\nHerein lies the critical importance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s proposals. They can make an immediate and\r\ntangible difference to issues affecting the entire\r\ninternational community which are beyond the scope of\r\nthe Security Council. Action on the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nproposals, therefore, should not have to await general\r\nagreement on Security Council reform. By focusing on\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nhis proposals, by subjecting them to a thorough and positive\r\ndiscussion, I believe we can move urgently needed United\r\nNations reforms forward at a faster pace than has hitherto\r\ncharacterized the reform process. And we can still remain\r\nseized of, but not hostage to, issues that may take more\r\ntime to command general agreement or that require Charter\r\namendment.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Amre Moussa,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt.\r\nMr. Moussa (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): Mr.\r\nPresident, to you and your friendly country, I am pleased\r\nto extend my warmest congratulations on your election to\r\nthe presidency of this session of the General Assembly.\r\nYour expertise on United Nations and world issues will\r\nundoubtedly assist you in wisely discharging the work of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to express our appreciation\r\nto your predecessor for the efforts he exerted in connection\r\nwith the discussions relating to United Nations reform.\r\nThe world is currently passing through highly\r\ninterwoven and complicated circumstances, where progress\r\nand its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers\r\nwhile humanity takes pride in such achievements as\r\neconomic progress and the development of technology and\r\ninformatics, it is still suffering from the practices of\r\nterrorism, drug trafficking, organized crime, the spread of\r\ncorruption, the overflow of refugees, the challenges posed\r\nby war criminals, crimes of genocide and mass murder, and\r\nthe negative effects of racism and religious discrimination.\r\nAll this gives rise to a situation which requires the\r\ninternational community to cooperate and become\r\ninterdependent in its endeavours in a manner that helps it\r\nlive in security and to progress confidently. This cannot\r\ntake place unless the United Nations become the focal point\r\nand the centre of its concerted actions.\r\nThis prompts us to accord priority in Egypt\u0027s statement\r\nto this session to the issue of United Nations reform. The\r\noutcome of this session, and probably subsequent sessions\r\nwill constitute a true litmus test of the credibility of\r\ndetermination and the objectivity of resolve regarding the\r\npresent and the future of the United Nations.\r\nEvolution of the United Nations relies on a number of\r\nfacts and requisites. The principles of democratization and\r\nmultilateralism are widespread, market economy\r\nmechanisms are growing, and scientific progress and\r\ninformation technology are accelerating. This necessitates\r\nreaching agreement on and drafting new rules for\r\ninternational conduct.\r\nIt has been shown that the end of the cold war in no\r\nway sufficiently guarantees the non-eruption of conflicts,\r\ntragedies and wars. By the same token, the risks\r\nemanating from the outbreak of rampant international\r\nconfrontations have not disappeared. The root causes of\r\nnational and international disputes still persist. On the\r\nother hand, weapons of mass destruction are readily\r\navailable and are even on the rise. In addition to the\r\nabsence of any substantial progress in the field of nuclear\r\ndisarmament, there exist clandestine military nuclear\r\nprogrammes not subject to any international supervision\r\nin strategically sensitive areas such as the Middle East\r\nregion.\r\nWhile globalization is a rapidly growing\r\nphenomenon, and given its impact on the security and\r\nprosperity of various societies, national legislation and\r\nregulations are finding it difficult to cope with this\r\nphenomenon and to regulate international relations\r\naccordingly. Most of the developing countries do not\r\npossess the same capacity as the developed ones to\r\nspeedily effect the necessary psychological, cultural and\r\nlegislative adjustments. Therefore, the United Nations\r\nrepresents the proper mechanism for the formulation of an\r\ninternational consensus on the rules governing all these\r\ndevelopments, and the provision of necessary assistance\r\nto the developing countries to meet and regulate their\r\nrequirements.\r\nMr. Karaha (Democratic Republic of the Congo),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWhile we agree on the need to change the United\r\nNations and increase its effectiveness, we might not be as\r\nagreed on the means to achieve that objective. In this\r\ncontext, I wish to state Egypt\u0027s view of the main\r\nprinciples and points on which the United Nations reform\r\nprocess should be based, in addition to a preliminary\r\ncomment on some of the Secretary-General\u0027s recent\r\nproposals in this respect.\r\nIt is important that the United Nations reform take\r\nplace in conformity with the purposes and principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter and the mandates accorded to\r\neach of the United Nations principal organs. The General\r\nAssembly, representing the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, has to adopt clear decisions which reflect\r\nthe general consensus with regard to the proposals\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General\u0027s report. Such consensus\r\nshould be built through serious intergovernmental dialogue\r\ncharacterized by maximum transparency and sense of\r\nresponsibility.\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-General\u0027s position that\r\nreforming the United Nations administrative machinery is\r\nnot a substitute for the political will of the Member States\r\nto enhance the role of the Organization. Thus, the first step\r\ntowards reform is the formation of a clear collective will to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations system through a\r\ncomprehensive approach in the interest of all.\r\nWhile we would generally welcome merging\r\ndepartments with similar activities as well as slashing a\r\nnumber of posts if the General Assembly so decides, we\r\nwish to stress that rationalizing expenditures must not be\r\ndone at the expense of efficient performance.\r\nAdministrative reform should not diminish the\r\nOrganization\u0027s capacity to fully implement the programmes\r\nadopted by the Member States. Nor should it adversely\r\naffect the equitable geographic distribution in the\r\ncomposition of the Secretariat.\r\nWe are also in agreement with the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\ndiagnosis of the real threat facing the United Nations,\r\nnamely the non-payment by some major Powers of their\r\nassessed contributions, be they to the regular budget or to\r\nthe budget of peacekeeping operations. Since these arrears\r\nare part of the Member States\u0027 obligations under the\r\nCharter, their payment should be made in full, immediately\r\nand without conditions. Any attempt to make payment\r\nconditional will only complicate the entire reform process.\r\nThe sharp and steady decline in the resources allocated\r\nto development, coupled with the absence of enthusiasm on\r\nthe part of some for the fulfilment of their obligations, have\r\nnegatively affected the implementation of many\r\nprogrammes adopted by Member States. This impels us to\r\nreview the funding modalities of the United Nations\r\noperational activities for development so as to ensure their\r\neffective performance.\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-General on the\r\nimportance of achieving the system-wide integration of\r\nUnited Nations programmes that deal with development.\r\nWe still look forward to hearing concrete ideas on how to\r\nachieve more comprehensive coordination throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system as well as on how to decentralize\r\nthe working methods of the regional economic\r\ncommissions. These commissions play a cardinal role in\r\nimplementing the Organization\u0027s priorities, such as\r\npoverty eradication.\r\nLastly, some of the other measures proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General, particularly those relating to how to\r\naddress the financial crisis, should be studied further with\r\na view to reaching arrangements which would enjoy\r\ngeneral consensus and help overcome this crisis.\r\nTherefore, we invite the General Assembly to study\r\nthe important proposals made by the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Assembly should then come up with\r\nrecommendations that clarify the Member States\u0027\r\naspirations and the modalities of implementing their\r\nspecified priorities in the medium-term plan, together with\r\nmeans of promoting the vital role of the Organization in\r\nthe coming decades.\r\nIn the course of reforming the United Nations, the\r\nSecretary-General touched upon the elaboration of a new\r\nconcept and structure of the Trusteeship Council. This is\r\na matter that requires extensive discussion and study to\r\nclarify the impact and dimensions of the proposed\r\nconcept, as it is totally different from the current mandate\r\nof the Council. Besides, it is imperative to discuss the\r\nsignificance of, and the need to put under collective\r\ntrusteeship, topics set forth by the world community in\r\nwell-established international agreements that express the\r\nwill of the international community as a whole. Under\r\nthose agreements, mechanisms and organs have already\r\nbeen set up to oversee their implementation.\r\nAlso, within the context of changing the role of the\r\nOrganization, we note that the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nproposals entrust the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights with many additional responsibilities\r\nand competencies at the expense of the functions\r\nentrusted to the Centre for Human Rights. In our view,\r\nthis is not in line with what is important in the\r\nmanagement of the human rights field. Here we recall\r\nsome recent sagacious appeals for updating the approach\r\nand legislation of the international community in the field\r\nof human rights in order to better reflect the diverse\r\ncontributions of various cultures and civilizations in our\r\ncontemporary world to the promotion and enrichment of\r\nthese rights and the protection of the freedom of\r\nindividuals and societies. Although some political\r\nconsiderations stood in the way of including the valuable\r\ncontributions of some of those cultures and civilizations\r\nin the main human rights instruments — foremost among\r\nwhich is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights —\r\nthese sagacious appeals reflect the desire to enhance the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\ncontribution of various world cultures in the protection of\r\nhuman rights. Such enhanced and diverse contributions, in\r\nthe framework of a world consensus, could spare the\r\ninternational community any accusation of negligence,\r\ndouble standards or bias towards a single cultural concept.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, I should point out that for\r\n50 years, the United Nations has given due regard to\r\ndisarmament issues. It has given high priority to matters\r\nrelating to weapons of mass destruction in general and\r\nnuclear weapons in particular. A consensus on this high\r\npriority emerged in the first special session of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to disarmament and has been reiterated\r\never since. Egypt remains faithful to this high priority.\r\nI now turn to the Security Council. Past Assembly\r\nsessions, especially the fifty-first, witnessed protracted\r\ndebates on the reform and restructuring of the Security\r\nCouncil. Undoubtedly, reaching agreement on this issue is\r\none of the main pillars on which reform of the United\r\nNations must be built.\r\nIn this regard, Egypt reiterates its emphasis on and\r\ncommitment to the key principles adopted at the ministerial\r\nmeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in New Delhi, as\r\nwell as the elements adopted by the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) Summit in Harare in connection with the\r\nCouncil\u0027s enlargement and the need for full conformity with\r\nthe relevant provisions of the Charter.\r\nTherefore, first, there should be no partial or selective\r\nexpansion or enlargement of the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. Secondly, efforts at restructuring the\r\nCouncil should not be subject to any imposed time-frame.\r\nWhile recognizing the importance of treating this issue as\r\na matter of urgent attention, no effort should be made to\r\ndecide this issue before general agreement is reached.\r\nThirdly, efforts should be made to rationalize the exercise\r\nof the veto. Fourthly, the improvement of the working\r\nmethods of the Council should be given equal importance.\r\nFifthly, any resolution with possible Charter-amendment\r\nimplications as to the size, the composition or the allocation\r\nof the Council seats must be adopted in strict conformity\r\nwith the provisions of Article 108 of the Charter. Sixthly,\r\nit is important to study the principle of rotation and to agree\r\nupon the eligibility criteria for it in connection with the\r\nproposed expansion in the permanent-membership category.\r\nSuch an agreement could help avoid the divisions and feuds\r\nthat have begun to surface. Lastly, if there is no agreement\r\non the expansion of permanent membership, expansion\r\nshould be limited to the non-permanent category.\r\nAs to eligibility of States for permanent membership\r\nin the Security Council, and with a view to our\r\ncommitment to what will be agreed upon within the OAU\r\nin connection with a system of rotation, we propose that\r\nthe criteria for eligibility should include the degree of\r\npresent and future economic development, historical\r\nweight, geographic location and size of population. They\r\nshould also give due regard to the role played by a\r\ncountry in the maintenance of global and regional peace\r\nand security, including its ability to contribute to\r\npeacekeeping operations. Further, similar regard should be\r\ngiven to such a country\u0027s endeavours to preserve the\r\ninterests of the region to which it belongs.\r\nEgypt\u0027s regional and international contributions\r\nwithin the framework of Africa, the Arab and Islamic\r\nworlds and the Middle East region, as well as among the\r\ndeveloping countries and emerging economies,\r\nundoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of\r\npermanent membership in a new, expanded Security\r\nCouncil providing balanced and equitable representation.\r\nHowever, Egypt will remain committed to the African\r\nconsensus in this regard. I listened carefully to the\r\nstatement made by the Foreign Minister of Singapore, and\r\nI suggest that the points he raised should be studied and\r\ngiven due attention by the General Assembly and the\r\ncommittees working in the field of the reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council.\r\nThe non-aligned countries called for a\r\nreconsideration of the veto power, which contradicts the\r\nprinciples of democracy that must characterize\r\ncontemporary world order and prevail both among and\r\nwithin States. As a first step towards that goal, we\r\nsuggest that the use and scope of the veto power should\r\nbe restricted to specific actions such as those which relate\r\nto threats to international peace and security and which\r\nare taken under Chapter VII of the Charter. We can also\r\nagree on excluding specific matters from the use of veto\r\npower, such as provision to the Council of the\r\ninformation necessary for exercising its competence;\r\nhumanitarian issues, including respect for instruments of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and ceasefire resolutions;\r\nand the selection of the United Nations Secretary-General.\r\nSecurity Council reform and the improvement of its\r\nworking methods require a re-evaluation of the sanctions\r\nregimes imposed by the Council, including their routine\r\nperiodic review, their lifting and whether the regime in its\r\ncurrent form achieves the goals for which it was\r\ninstituted. If sanctions are intended to influence the\r\nbehaviour of certain States so that they abide by\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\ninternational legality, it would be only logical to amend the\r\nway these sanctions are currently implemented in order to\r\ntake into account the related humanitarian aspects and the\r\nsufferings inflicted upon the peoples. And after compliance,\r\nthese sanctions must be lifted.\r\nIn all cases, it is important to consider setting specific\r\ntime-frames for sanctions so that they do not end up being,\r\nin effect, a people\u0027s punishment. Discussions in this respect\r\nunder “An Agenda for Peace” and the initial agreement\r\nreached thereon can be a viable basis for starting serious\r\ndeliberations with a view to effecting positive changes in\r\nthe current sanctions regime.\r\nI turn now to the situation in the Middle East, where\r\nthe peace process faces a serious crisis. The most apparent\r\nmanifestation of this crisis is that the concept, principles\r\nand bases of the peace process are being completely\r\nshattered and squandered. The vision spawned in the\r\npeoples\u0027 minds of the sort of peace, as agreed upon at the\r\nUnited Nations and in Madrid, has started to dissipate.\r\nTrust has been replaced by doubt, and hope by frustration\r\nand despair in a tomorrow where justice will materialize\r\nand peace will prevail.\r\nThe peace process is based on governing principles,\r\nnamely the implementation of Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973). At the heart of these principles\r\nare the land-for-peace formula and safeguarding the rights\r\nof the parties according to the balance struck by the\r\nSecurity Council and affirmed at the Madrid Peace\r\nConference. This certainly applies to the three tracks of\r\nnegotiations between Israel on the one hand and Syria,\r\nLebanon and the Palestinians on the other. The Oslo accord\r\ndid not deviate from the same principles, nor did it\r\nchallenge their terms of reference or binding nature. On the\r\ncontrary, it led to the recognition that the Palestinian people\r\nare a people with legitimate national and political rights.\r\nIt also recognized that the only way to establish peace\r\nand security in the region is through peaceful coexistence\r\nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, based on\r\nequality, justice, and, of course, Israel\u0027s withdrawal from\r\nthe occupied Arab territories and the establishment of\r\nnormal relations between the States in the Middle East.\r\nThese principles and concepts gave rise to a process\r\nof building bases for peace and its possibilities. In spite of\r\nthe obstacles and the problems which confronted the\r\nprocess of negotiations, the credibility of the search for a\r\npeaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict still existed.\r\nThis quest for peace had become a strategic choice\r\ncharacterizing the policies and orientations of the region\u0027s\r\nGovernments, impelling the peoples of the region to\r\nenvision a future Middle East under a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace. Various methods and mechanisms\r\nfor cooperation which would enable the region to achieve\r\nthe requisite levels of development and progress were\r\ndiscussed. Despite the frequent diversity of views and\r\ntheir conflicting nature at certain times, that trend\r\nrepresented a healthy phenomenon: it indicated that the\r\npeoples of the region are already convinced of the peace\r\nconcept. The only thing that remained was how to\r\nreinvigorate the method of achieving it.\r\nAlas, confidence was lost, credibility was shaken and\r\nthe peace process lost much of its momentum. For this,\r\nand for the present serious situation, the current Israeli\r\nGovernment\u0027 policy is responsible. Settlement activities,\r\nas well as Israel\u0027s reneging on agreements and\r\ncommitments reached; making a mockery of legal\r\naccords; challenging the two sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess; pushing for confrontation; and giving rise to an\r\noverall feeling of despair could not but result in\r\nfrustration and destruction. This will lead to a catastrophe\r\nwhose responsibility, we hasten to underline here and\r\nnow, lies squarely with the current Israeli policies.\r\nThis serious crisis inflicted on the peace process by\r\nthe Israeli policies was recently considered by the Council\r\nof Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the States members of\r\nthe League of Arab States. The Council adopted the\r\nfollowing points, which constitute a unified Arab position\r\non the current situation.\r\nThe first point is a rejection of the Israeli\r\nGovernment policies designed to undermine the peace\r\nprocess, its denial of the principles and bases of this\r\nprocess, its evasion of the implementation of the\r\ncommitments, undertakings and agreements reached\r\nwithin the context of the peace process, and its unilateral\r\nmeasures aimed at imposing a fait accompli in Jerusalem,\r\nthe West Bank and the Golan, along with its aggression\r\nagainst southern Lebanon.\r\nThe second point is the upholding of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective\r\non the basis of the principles of the peace process, and in\r\nparticular of the relevant Security Council resolutions, the\r\nprinciple of land for peace and the attainment of the\r\nlegitimate political rights of the Palestinian people, and a\r\nreaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this\r\nposition.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nThe third point reiterates that Israel\u0027s breach of the\r\nprinciples and the bases of the peace process, its\r\nbacktracking on the commitments, undertakings and\r\nagreements reached thereon and its procrastination in\r\nimplementing these commitments have resulted in the\r\ncurrent setback of the peace process. These Israeli policies\r\nhave also led to a reconsideration of the steps taken\r\ntowards Israel within the framework of the peace process.\r\nFull responsibility for this lies with the Israeli Government\r\nalone.\r\nFourth, negotiations on the three bilateral tracks should\r\nbe resumed. On the Syrian track, negotiations should be\r\nresumed from wherever they ended. The two parties should\r\ncommit themselves to what has already been achieved. On\r\nthe Lebanese track, negotiations should centre upon the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\r\nAnd on the Palestinian track, negotiations should be\r\nresumed on the basis of implementing the contractual\r\nagreements reached, including the commitments of the\r\ninterim period. Parallel to that, final status negotiations\r\nshould start in order to lead to the Palestinian people\u0027s\r\nexercise of their right to self-determination and to the\r\nestablishment of their independent state.\r\nFifth, the Council welcomed the American position as\r\ncrystallized during the visit paid by the United States\r\nSecretary of State to the region this month. There was\r\nconsensus regarding cooperation with United States policy\r\nas expressed by Mrs. Albright in her statement of 6 August\r\n1997 to the National Press Club in Washington. That\r\npolicy, which was reiterated during her recent visit to the\r\nMiddle East and contacts with the States of the region,\r\nreaffirms the terms of reference of the Madrid Peace\r\nConference, in particular the principle of land for peace, the\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions,\r\nthe realization of the legitimate political rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, and the commitment to abstain from\r\ntaking unilateral measures that undermine the permanent\r\nstatus negotiations. We stress the need to build on this\r\npositive position on the part of the United States, and call\r\non Israel to respond positively to it. In this context, the\r\nsteps that the Israeli Government is required to take to\r\nfoster the peace process should be within the framework of\r\nkey issues, not that of issues of a secondary or formalistic\r\nnature.\r\nSixth, the European role played in support of the\r\npeace process is welcome and the importance of its\r\nrevitalization should be stressed.\r\nSeventh, international legality in the context of the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions should be\r\nupheld and implemented.\r\nA stable and just peace must be built on a strong\r\nbasis of comprehensive security arrangements that take\r\ndue account of the apprehensions, concerns and\r\nviewpoints of all parties. This can materialize only when\r\nIsrael accedes to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), as it is the only State in the\r\nregion that has not yet done so. We should proceed\r\nforthwith with the implementation of President Hosni\r\nMubarak\u0027s initiative to free the Middle East from all\r\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivering vehicles.\r\nIt is a source of regret for us that so far no practical steps\r\nhave been taken to rid our region of the threat of nuclear\r\nweapons. This might lead to the proliferation of such\r\nweapons. Consequently, I call upon the General Assembly\r\nand the NPT depositories to take the necessary steps to\r\nensure Israel\u0027s accession to the NPT and for the prompt\r\nundertaking of serious negotiations to establish a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East, in implementation\r\nof the resolution adopted by the Review and Extension\r\nConference of the Parties to the NPT held in New York\r\nin April 1995. Such a nuclear-weapon-free zone could be\r\nestablished as a first step towards ridding the Middle East\r\nof all weapons of mass destruction.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks regarding the Middle\r\nEast, I would like to refer to the serious situation in Iraq.\r\nI would like to highlight the importance of respecting\r\nIraq\u0027s sovereignty and of ending the suffering of its\r\npeople. Furthermore, the islands of the United Arab\r\nEmirates should be returned, and the sovereignty of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates over these islands should be\r\nrespected. The Lockerbie issue should be brought to an\r\nend in conformity with international legality. The\r\nterritorial integrity of the Sudan should be preserved and\r\nrespected. A settlement of the problems of Somalia\r\nshould be reached. A healthy climate for relations should\r\nbe created in the Middle East between States of the\r\nregion and neighbouring countries, based upon mutual and\r\nbalanced commitments along with a common interest in\r\nmaintaining positive relations for the benefit of everyone.\r\nTurning to Africa, I wish to refer to the ministerial\r\nmeeting convened by the Security Council last week to\r\nconsider the sources and causes of African conflicts and\r\nhow to contain and resolve them. As I said in my\r\nstatement before the Council, Africa has come a long way\r\non the road of political and economic reform. What is\r\nneeded now is to revitalize existing international\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\ninitiatives in support of development and stability in Africa.\r\nSuch international support is also required to solve the\r\nproblems of refugees, enhance democratization and\r\nstrengthen regional and subregional integration. This\r\nrequires the fulfilment of promises by the international\r\ncommunity to establish a true partnership between Africa,\r\non the one hand, and the United Nations system and the\r\ninternational donor institutions on the other. This also\r\nrequires strengthening existing cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity in\r\nconformity with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter.\r\nSince the dawn of history, the Mediterranean\r\ndimension has been an important framework for Egypt,\r\ninfluencing and being influenced by the centres of\r\ncivilization and enlightenment in the region. Inasmuch as\r\nEurope — Eastern and Western — has been the main\r\npartner with Egypt in trade transactions, tourist flows and\r\ncultural interactions, so has Egypt been and will continue\r\nto be a major active party in ensuring stability and\r\nregulating a veritable interaction between the European\r\ndimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean\r\ndimension of European security, in the full meaning of the\r\ncomprehensive concept of contemporary security.\r\nIn this context, President Hosni Mubarak in November\r\n1991 presented to the European Parliament his well-known\r\ninitiative of establishing a framework for consultation and\r\ncooperation among the Mediterranean countries. By mid-\r\n1994, this idea was crystallized when the Ministers for\r\nForeign Affairs of 11 Mediterranean countries held in\r\nAlexandria their constituent session for the Mediterranean\r\nForum, which convened its fourth session last July in\r\nAlgiers, where the ministers unanimously agreed that the\r\nForum was a unique gathering for frank dialogue and a\r\nmechanism for the formulation and testing of ideas and\r\ncoordination of positions.\r\nThrough its chairmanship of the cultural working\r\ngroup of the Mediterranean Forum, Egypt looks forward to\r\ncontributing to strengthening cultural cooperation among the\r\nmember countries and stressing the common cultural\r\nfeatures of the Mediterranean personality, based upon the\r\nintegration and interaction of civilizations, rather than\r\nconflict and confrontation between them.\r\nA similar exercise is currently under way with regard\r\nto Euro-Mediterranean interaction, in the framework of the\r\nBarcelona process. The second ministerial conference,\r\nconvened in Malta last April, provided a good opportunity\r\nfor frankness and an exchange of views to activate and\r\ncorrect the path of this historic process that brings\r\ntogether countries of the European Union and those of the\r\nsouth and the east of the Mediterranean. In so doing, this\r\nprocess will truly lead to the creation of a balanced\r\npartnership among all parties, as well as the establishment\r\nof a common zone of peace and prosperity in the\r\nMediterranean basin.\r\nIn this context, Egypt follows with keen interest\r\ncurrent developments in the Balkans, a region closely\r\nlinked to the Mediterranean region, especially with regard\r\nto developments relating to the situation in Bosnia. Egypt\r\nbelieves that the only way out of tension in that region is\r\nthat of international legality, the full and speedy\r\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreements and the trying\r\nof war criminals, which represents an essential step\r\ntowards establishing justice and stability in this region.\r\nEgypt reaffirms its partnership with the international\r\ncommunity, the United Nations system and the donor\r\ninstitutions in the development and reconstruction of\r\nBosnia in order to help heal the wounds of years of war\r\nand destruction.\r\nI should not fail to address the concerns of Egypt\r\nand other developing countries regarding a number of\r\nchallenges accompanying the process of trade and\r\ninvestment liberalization. These challenges are manifested\r\nin the continued pursuit by some of unilateral and\r\narbitrary policies instead of abidance by the rules and\r\nregulations of the international trading system that we all\r\nworked so hard to adopt within the framework of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization.\r\nThis is in addition to the growing trend we witness\r\ntoday on the part of some of our trading partners who\r\nresort to covert protectionist practices, which hide behind\r\nnoble considerations such as environmental protection,\r\nrespect for labour norms and human rights, in order to\r\nserve some narrow self-interests, to justify the restriction\r\nof access to markets and to impose trade sanctions.\r\nOn another plane, we should be well aware that the\r\nliberalization of investment is not a panacea for every\r\nmalaise besetting our economies. Despite our interest in\r\nattracting investments, and despite our efforts to create a\r\nclimate conducive to the flow of investments, the fact still\r\nremains that investment agreements should strike a fair\r\nbalance between protecting the rights of the investor, on\r\nthe one hand and ensuring the rights and interests of the\r\nreceiving States, on the other.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nA year ago, from this rostrum, I called for concerted\r\nefforts against attempts to marginalize the role of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIf we are still awaiting the development of rules of\r\ninternational conduct under a new world order that is still\r\nevolving, we then urgently need to ensure the survival of a\r\nstrong and effective United Nations that can lead the way\r\nfor us in this nascent world order.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Chairman of\r\nthe delegation of New Zealand, His Excellency Mr. Michael\r\nJohn Powles.\r\nMr. Powles (New Zealand): May I begin by\r\ncongratulating the President on his election to preside over\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session. We are in\r\ngood hands as we begin our work during what the\r\nSecretary-General has called “the reform Assembly.”\r\nI know, too, that my Foreign Minister, on whose\r\nbehalf I am speaking, would want to warmly congratulate\r\nthe outgoing President, Ambassador Razali Ismail of\r\nMalaysia, on his efforts during the past 12 months. It has\r\nbeen a challenging time, and he has demonstrated the\r\ndecisive leadership we all expected of him.\r\nTwo years ago, at the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations, world leaders undertook to give the twenty-\r\nfirst century an Organization equipped, financed and\r\nstructured to serve effectively the peoples in whose name\r\nit was established. With the year 2000 now only 27 months\r\naway, we are still far from that goal. This is a matter of\r\ngreat concern to New Zealand. We firmly believe in the\r\nUnited Nations as a vehicle to a better life for the world\u0027s\r\ncitizens, and not just for those who live now. We have a\r\nresponsibility to strengthen the Organization for our\r\ngrandchildren and beyond. We must not let them and\r\nourselves down by allowing an unreformed United Nations\r\nto slide into increasing irrelevance.\r\nWe do not pretend the process of reform is easy or\r\nfinite. As the Secretary-General has said, “Reform is not an\r\nevent; it is a process.” [A/51/950, para. 25] Our own in\r\nvolvement on the intergovernmental track, including co-\r\nchairing the Working Group on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations System and the Working Group on an\r\nAgenda for Development, has given us a good appreciation\r\nof the complexities involved in producing positive outcomes\r\nacceptable to 185 Member States.\r\nWe know the Secretary-General faces the same\r\nissues with his 16 July package. As with any package, it\r\nis inevitable that some Member States will find fault with\r\nindividual elements. But we are firmly of the belief that\r\nthe package should be viewed as a whole. This will be\r\nfor the greater good of the Organization. Difficulties with\r\nindividual elements of the package should not be allowed\r\nto unpick the overall good which is in it. We appeal to\r\nMember States to acknowledge this reality and to give the\r\nSecretary-General their generous support. It is small\r\ncountries like New Zealand, and developing countries,\r\nwhich, as we see it, stand most to benefit from what the\r\nSecretary-General is trying to achieve.\r\nTo reform and strengthen the United Nations\r\neffectively, we see a need to redistribute resources away\r\nfrom administration and into areas which are important\r\nfor those of us who place a high priority on the United\r\nNations itself. We support efficiencies, not cost-cutting.\r\nThe crucial difference between the two is that one\r\napproach seeks simply to save money without regard to\r\nthe impact on the Organization. We cannot support this.\r\nThe United Nations is too important to us to allow such\r\na downgrading.\r\nAn approach based on efficiencies allows us to\r\nreinvigorate the United Nations by reinvesting the money\r\nsaved from outdated administrative practices. This is\r\ncentral to the Secretary-General\u0027s package. In particular,\r\nthe proposal for a “development dividend” channelling\r\nresources freed by administrative efficiencies into\r\nstrengthening the development activities of the United\r\nNations is most welcome. We can certify from our own\r\nnational experience that the sort of management reforms\r\nproposed in the package do indeed lead to a reduction in\r\nadministrative overheads, allowing more to be delivered\r\nin terms of substantive programmes.\r\nAt a time when development funds are diminishing,\r\nthe significance of this step should not be lost. New\r\nZealand is a country that is increasing its overseas aid —\r\nby 40 per cent since the 1992 United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development, the Rio Summit. Our\r\ncontributions through the United Nations system have also\r\nincreased by nearly 50 per cent over the last five years.\r\nBut the global trend is the opposite, particularly among\r\nthe larger traditional donors. It is becoming harder and\r\nharder for Governments to meet their Charter commitment\r\nto promote the economic and social advancement of all\r\npeoples. One of the modest outcomes of the last two\r\nyears of reform efforts within the United Nations has\r\nbeen the elaboration of an Agenda for Development\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nreaffirming the primacy of development, setting objectives\r\nand recommending ways of achieving them. But, with the\r\nbest will in the world, implementing that Agenda will come\r\nto naught in the absence of adequate funding.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s reforms are designed to\r\ndeliver more for development. Equally important, they are\r\ndesigned to boost confidence in the United Nations,\r\nconfidence which two weeks ago was given tangible form\r\nby Mr. Ted Turner\u0027s billion-dollar grant to assist United\r\nNations agencies in key development activities. That\r\ngenerous offer has given the Organization a real boost and\r\ncould be a catalyst for leveraging further private-sector\r\nfunds for development. We must support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s efforts to make the United Nations the best\r\nvehicle for delivering such assistance.\r\nMember States need to trust the Secretary-General to\r\nfulfil his responsibilities under the Charter: to give effect to\r\nthe policy directions which they set. We need to be clear\r\nand realistic in the priorities we set for the United Nations.\r\nWe cannot mandate the Organization with more and more\r\nnew tasks and somehow expect these to be achieved within\r\ncurrent resources. And, having set the priorities, we must\r\nresist the temptation to micro-manage. This will involve a\r\nsea-change in the way Member States have become\r\naccustomed to operating. The Fifth Committee still makes\r\ndecisions about staff numbers and placement within the\r\nSecretariat, administrative decisions that in any modern\r\norganization would be the responsibility of its managers.\r\nWe know that the transitional process of change will\r\nnot be easy for those working in the Secretariat either.\r\nBut — and we are conscious of our own experience in New\r\nZealand in instituting public-sector reform — the\r\nmanagerial and results-based budgeting proposals in the\r\nJuly package will improve work performance and will\r\ndeliver greater job satisfaction to those working for the\r\nUnited Nations. The Organization\u0027s most important resource\r\nis its people. The package recognizes the vital importance\r\nof investment in staff. If the best and brightest are to be\r\nattracted to and retained by the United Nations, they must\r\nbe recruited, trained, promoted and paid according to\r\nprocedures which are as good as the best employed by\r\nMember States.\r\nIt is also important to stress here the loyalty owed to\r\nthe Secretary-General by those who work for him. He has\r\nthe right to expect their full support for his leadership and\r\nfor the initiatives he puts forward. Anything less would be\r\ndishonourable, would subvert due process and would\r\npotentially disenfranchise Member States. It could not be\r\ntolerated.\r\nI referred earlier to the intergovernmental track. It is\r\nworth touching on the key issues of Security Council and\r\nfinancial reform.\r\nOn the former, New Zealand will judge specific\r\nproposals for enlargement of the Security Council by the\r\nyardstick of democracy and the representativeness of the\r\ninstitution as a whole. Increasing the proportion of\r\npermanent to non-permanent members runs counter to this\r\nprinciple. Nor could a package on Security Council\r\nreform be acceptable to us without substantive proposals\r\nopening up and modernizing the workings of the Council.\r\nSunshine, an American jurist once observed, is the best\r\ndisinfectant. Member States must continue to participate\r\nin the debate in the search for a consensus solution.\r\nOn financial reform, New Zealand is strongly\r\nconcerned about the crisis facing the United Nations. It is\r\ntrue that there are problems with the scales of assessments\r\nfor both the regular and the peacekeeping budgets. The\r\npresent floor has a negative impact on smaller, vulnerable\r\nnations, such as the South Pacific island countries, New\r\nZealand\u0027s neighbours. This is just one example of the kind\r\nof problem that needs to be addressed.\r\nBut those who want to see changes made to the\r\nscale need to offer genuine inducements, not threats. We\r\ncannot accept that any Member State is entitled to\r\nwithhold payments unilaterally or that the assessment of\r\nthose countries that will not pay their dues should be\r\npicked up by others. All assessed contributions must be\r\npaid in full, on time and unconditionally. It is a violation\r\nof international legal obligations to do otherwise. This\r\nmust be regarded with the utmost seriousness by Member\r\nStates. It undermines the Organization\u0027s ability to operate.\r\nIt penalizes, through damage to the Organization, those\r\nMember States that abide by their obligations. When the\r\nState responsible for the largest percentage of arrears\r\nowed to the United Nations is also the richest, and when\r\nthat State in addition attaches conditions to the payment\r\nof only a portion of what it owes, it is understandable that\r\nthese actions should generate real scepticism in this\r\nAssembly.\r\nThis sorry state of affairs must be resolved quickly.\r\nBut it can be resolved only on the basis of a credible\r\ncommitment that all conditions will be eliminated now\r\nand that all payments will be made on time. And that\r\nmeans in January each year.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nI would like to raise another reform issue which has\r\nnot featured prominently in discussions to date, namely\r\nUnited Nations regional groupings. It seems to us that this\r\nis an issue that deserves examination. The groupings are in\r\nneed of revision to bring them up to date with present-day\r\ngeopolitical realities. It is anomalous, for example, that our\r\nPacific island neighbours, members with us of the South\r\nPacific Forum grouping, belong to the Asian Group while,\r\nfor historical reasons, New Zealand belongs to the Group\r\nof Western European and Other States. The fundamental\r\nimportance we accord our membership of the institutions of\r\nthe South Pacific Forum, of the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council and of the Regional Forum of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and our\r\nrelationship with ASEAN itself, should be able to be better\r\nreflected in the regional groupings. We accordingly see\r\nvalue in a reconfiguration of New York electoral groupings\r\nto bring them more in line with those used elsewhere in the\r\nUnited Nations system, where New Zealand in most cases\r\nsits with our South Pacific partners and our East Asian\r\nneighbours.\r\nDevelopments in other regions will result in further\r\nanomalies in the present structure. We see at a future stage\r\nsome long and complex negotiations over regional seat\r\nallocations for a revised system of regional groups. New\r\nZealand of course will join with others in negotiating new\r\nand equitable allocations of seats. While we look forward\r\nto the outcome of that process, we realize that it will not\r\ncome overnight. In the meantime, and as a matter of high\r\npriority, my delegation is working to forge a closer\r\nrelationship with the Asian regional group in New York.\r\nI would like to close my statement by focusing once\r\nmore on the utmost importance of Member States\u0027 giving\r\npositive endorsement to the Secretary-General\u0027s package at\r\nthis General Assembly, as New Zealand will be doing —\r\nnot only because it provides a positive and concrete start to\r\na reform process, but also because the alternative of not\r\nsupporting the Secretary-General will, in our view,\r\nseriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations.\r\nFor two years the United Nations has been involved in\r\nthe current reform exercise. But none of us can pretend that\r\nreform is an end in itself, or that introspection is an\r\nongoing excuse for inaction. The United Nations exists to\r\ndeliver concrete, substantive assistance to the hundreds of\r\nmillions most in need. No amount of self-analysis is a\r\nsubstitute for that. Moreover, sustained emphasis on\r\nintrospection will erode the Organization\u0027s capacity, and\r\npossibly also its will, to perform the tasks for which it was\r\ncreated.\r\nThe challenge now is to embrace the bold\r\nprogramme of reform outlined by the Secretary-General,\r\nto use this General Assembly to begin to implement it,\r\nand then to direct our energy where it rightly belongs, to\r\ntaking practical steps to reduce suffering and build a\r\nbetter and more peaceful world: like drawing up a solid,\r\npractical programme for alleviating poverty in the coming\r\ndecade; like establishing an international criminal court\r\nwhich will ensure that individuals are held responsible for\r\nwar crimes; like supporting and enhancing the United\r\nNations capability for preventive diplomacy; and like\r\ninvigorating the United Nations capacity for\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nThese are the standards by which the real success or\r\nfailure of the United Nations will be judged. New Zealand\r\nis determined that the verdict will be a positive one.\r\nWorking together, we can ensure that it is.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker on my list\r\nis His Excellency Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha,\r\nMinister for External Relations of Sudan, to whom I now\r\ngive the floor.\r\nMr. Taha (Sudan)(interpretation from Arabic): At\r\nthe outset I would like to express my congratulations to\r\nthe President on the confidence the General Assembly\r\nshowed in him by electing him to preside over fifty-\r\nsecond session. We have no doubt that his experience and\r\ncapability in multilateral diplomacy will assist him in\r\nconducting the deliberations of this session towards\r\nsuccess. We assure him of the cooperation and support of\r\nthe delegation of the Sudan.\r\nI would also like to express my gratitude and\r\nappreciation to the President\u0027s predecessor, His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for his distinguished efforts\r\nand bold initiatives within the context of strengthening the\r\nrole of the United Nations and the improvement of its\r\nmethods of work.\r\nLikewise, we would like to extend our\r\ncongratulations to the United Nations Secretary-General,\r\nKofi Annan. In a very short time since the assumption of\r\nhis post, he has demonstrated enthusiasm, ability and\r\npatience in leading this Organization. This has been\r\nembodied in his initiative to reform it, improve its\r\nmethods of work and enhance its stature.\r\nWe commend the genuine endeavours of the\r\nSecretary-General to reform the United Nations system.\r\nIn this connection, the Sudan will stand by his side until\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nthe United Nations realizes the purposes for which it was\r\nestablished, chief among which is the strengthening of\r\npeace and international cooperation for the achievement of\r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty, particularly in\r\nAfrica and in developing countries.\r\nWe would also like to affirm the keenness of the\r\nSudan that the programme of reform should result in\r\nstrengthening the ability of the United Nations to respond\r\nto humanitarian, social and developmental issues undertaken\r\nby the Organization. Furthermore, the reform should lead\r\nto the consolidation of the participation of developing\r\ncountries in the Organization and their equitable\r\nrepresentation in the Secretariat.\r\nThe Sudan calls for giving the reform endeavours\r\nenough time. The results and recommendations of the\r\nOpen-ended High Level Working Group on the\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations System, adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, should be given special attention. My\r\ncountry reaffirms its intention to participate effectively in\r\nthe meetings to be agreed upon within the proper\r\nframework, with the aim of reaching a consensus on all\r\naspects of the reform.\r\nThe Sudan attaches special attention and interest to the\r\nissue of reform of the Security Council through the\r\nenlargement of its permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership, and the improvement of its methods of work.\r\nOur interest derives from our deep-rooted conviction about\r\nthe importance of enhancing transparency and democracy\r\nin the work of the Council, so as to respond to the\r\nchanging realities and the current challenges facing\r\ninternational peace and security, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples and provisions of the Charter which define the\r\nduties of the Council in the peaceful resolution of\r\nconflict — far from using it as an instrument of peoples\u0027\r\npunishment.\r\nThe Sudan, while welcoming the efforts made for the\r\nreform of the Security Council, reaffirms the necessity of\r\nobserving equitable geographical representation and\r\npreserving the principle of state sovereignty. In this\r\nconnection, we would like to reiterate our commitment to\r\nthe New Delhi Declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nas well as our commitment to the African position taken at\r\nthe Harare summit.\r\nWe wish to stress the importance of linking the right\r\nof veto to the aspects relating to enlargement of the Council\r\nand improvement of its methods of work, in a way that\r\nwould secure a comprehensive consideration through\r\ndeliberate negotiations relative to all aspects, within a\r\ndemocratic and open-ended membership.\r\nIt is important to deal with the points that the\r\nForeign Minister of Singapore made in his statement this\r\nmorning. At this time last year I informed the Assembly\r\nof our efforts to establish peace in the Sudan, which\r\nresulted at that time in the signing of the “Peace Charter”.\r\nToday, it is with honour and pride that I convey to this\r\ndistinguished gathering that we have succeeded in\r\nevolving that “Peace Charter” into a comprehensive\r\n“Peace Agreement” signed in April this year by the\r\nGovernment and the fighting factions and political entities\r\nin southern Sudan. The Agreement has been endorsed by\r\nthe Sudanese Parliament, and thus it has, par excellence,\r\nbecome one of the most important political events in the\r\nhistory of the Sudan.\r\nThe Khartoum Peace Agreement provides for a\r\nlasting settlement to the Sudanese problem. The\r\nnegotiating parties have reached a formula which\r\nidentifies a framework for peaceful coexistence in the\r\ncountry. In the Agreement, the principle of citizenship\r\nconstitutes the basis for rights, duties and equality of\r\nparticipation of all Sudanese in the responsibilities of\r\npublic life, without discrimination as to race or religion.\r\nIt further consolidates the principle of democratic\r\nevolution in the Sudan. It clearly defines the question of\r\npower sharing between the state governments and the\r\nfederal authority within the federal system in the country.\r\nIn addition, it provides for the bases and criteria for\r\nwealth-sharing in the country.\r\nWith regard to public liberties and human rights, the\r\nagreement guarantees the same liberties and rights\r\nembodied in divine revelation and in the texts of relevant\r\ninternational instruments and agreements. In that way it\r\nwill have a considerable influence in consolidating and\r\nguaranteeing human rights. Furthermore, the agreement\r\nallows for the people of southern Sudan to exercise their\r\nright to self-determination through a free referendum to\r\nbe held at the end of a four-year transitional period.\r\nAn additional, complementary arrangement was\r\nagreed upon to prevent hostilities and ensure a ceasefire\r\nbetween the signatory parties with the aim of enhancing\r\nthe requisites for peace and stability. Furthermore, in\r\naccordance with the collective will of the people of the\r\nSudan, a presidential decree granted an unconditional\r\ngeneral amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and\r\nall civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years\r\npreceding the signing of the agreement.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nIn our quest to enhance the scope of a comprehensive\r\nand lasting peace, an agreement was reached last week with\r\nthe only remaining faction that was still carrying arms,\r\nthereby allowing for the resumption of peace talks on 28\r\nOctober 1997 in the Kenyan capital under the auspices of\r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\r\nI am honoured to be able to renew the determination and to\r\nexpress the eagerness of the Government of the Sudan for\r\nmaking the forthcoming talks a success.\r\nThe courageous steps taken by the Government of the\r\nSudan towards achieving a just and lasting peace have been\r\nwidely commended and appreciated by many States in the\r\nworld. One of its early positive results was the beginning\r\nof the voluntary repatriation of displaced persons and\r\nrefugees from neighbouring countries.\r\nWe call upon the United Nations, the international\r\nfinancial institutions and our development partners to\r\ncontribute to the resettlement of the returnees by shifting\r\nfrom humanitarian assistance to programmes of\r\nrehabilitation and the provision of developmental assistance\r\nneeded to consolidate the foundations of peace, which has\r\nbeen sought for many decades. This call derives its\r\nlegitimacy from the spirit and content of the Security\r\nCouncil ministerial-level meeting held on 25 September to\r\ndiscuss the current situation in Africa. The meeting\r\nconsolidated the link between peace and development, the\r\nlatter being one of the basic human rights.\r\nIn the same context, in striving to develop a system of\r\ngood and responsible governance, the Sudan has witnessed\r\nimportant constitutional developments, which have been\r\nmanifested in the establishment of a national committee for\r\npreparing the draft of a permanent constitution to be\r\nsubmitted to the legislative body and then presented to the\r\npeople in a referendum.\r\nIn the economic field, in support of a market economy\r\nand policies of liberalization, we have taken serious steps\r\ntowards the rationalization of public expenditure, the\r\nprivatization of the public sector, the abolition of\r\nrestrictions on internal and external trade and the promotion\r\nof investment. These policies have led to the reactivation of\r\nthe economy and reduced the inflation rate from 114 per\r\ncent at the beginning of this year to 28.5 per cent in August\r\nof this year. Furthermore, we have achieved a positive\r\ngrowth rate of 5.5 per cent and stability in the rate of\r\nexchange of the national currency. This progress was\r\ncommended by the International Monetary Fund mission in\r\nits report to the Executive Council of the Fund last August.\r\nHowever, the major obstacle to the accomplishment of the\r\neconomic reform programme continues to be an\r\ninsufficiency of external resources needed to boost\r\nproduction. We therefore appeal to the donor countries\r\nand the international financial institutions to provide the\r\nnecessary resources for the completion of the process of\r\neconomic reform. We also reaffirm that the Sudan\r\nwelcomes and encourages private and joint investments in\r\nall fields.\r\nAs for the problem of debt, it is imperative to\r\naddress it within a comprehensive international framework\r\nand not on a bilateral basis, so as to make possible the\r\nbuilding of a world economic system based on justice and\r\nequality among all States without distinction.\r\nIn recognition of the importance of regional\r\neconomic cooperation, African States have taken steps\r\ntowards the revitalization of the African Economic\r\nCommunity, in addition to the subregional economic\r\norganizations, all of which need the support and\r\nassistance of the international community.\r\nWe should not fail to stress the aspirations of Africa\r\nwith regard to the implementation of the United Nations\r\nConvention to Combat Desertification and the importance\r\nof following up on the outcome of the World Food\r\nSummit in the context of achieving food security for the\r\nnations of the continent and of the necessity to provide\r\nthe required resources to the countries concerned. In this\r\ncontext, the Sudan reaffirms its readiness to effectively\r\ncontribute to the programmes and action plans for the\r\nprovision of food, with the serious participation of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nEconomic development on the one hand and security\r\nand stability on the other are two sides of the same coin.\r\nIn speaking about poverty eradication in the African\r\ncontinent, we must stress the need for the realization of\r\npeace as a means to guarantee the security of the African\r\npeoples on the one hand and to accelerate the continent\u0027s\r\ndevelopment on the other hand. In this respect we\r\ncommend the positive developments in Liberia and we\r\nhope that this model will encourage our brothers in\r\nSomalia and Congo (Brazzaville) to stop the bloodshed.\r\nWe also hope that in Sierra Leone the endeavours being\r\nled by the countries of West Africa will succeed in\r\nsolving the problems facing that country. Africa\u0027s need for\r\nsecurity, stability and development requires it to become\r\na zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Africa needs assistance in clearing anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, left behind by civil wars in a\r\nnumber of its countries, including my own.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nThe Sudan supports the efforts of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of its Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nSalim Ahmed Salim, to restore peace and stability in many\r\nAfrican States. With regard to the formation of African\r\npeacekeeping forces, we stress the need to harmonize any\r\nmeasures taken in this matter with the resolutions and\r\npositions of the OAU. Africa should have the right, through\r\nits regional organizations, to take the initiative and to lead\r\nin this matter.\r\nWhile addressing the subject of economic hardship in\r\nAfrica, it is incumbent upon us to mention the exasperating\r\neffects of the imposition of sanctions, in particular those\r\nimposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We call for the\r\nsettlement of this issue on the basis of the proposal\r\npresented by the OAU and the League of Arab States,\r\nsupported by the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe support the proposal of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement to lay down specific measures and rules for\r\nsanctions and to strictly observe the provisions of the\r\nCharter. We share the concerns expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report on the work of the Organization for\r\nthis year about the negative effects of sanctions on peoples.\r\nWe look forward to the proposals he has promised to\r\npresent in this regard.\r\nIn Asia, we welcome the return of Hong Kong to the\r\nparent country, the People\u0027s Republic of China. We are\r\nfollowing with interest the efforts of the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nSpecial Envoy to Afghanistan. We hope that the parties in\r\nconflict will cooperate with the United Nations so as to\r\nreach a formula for understanding and agreement. We also\r\ncall upon the international community to support the\r\ncontinuous efforts to establish peace in the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nWith regard to developments in the Middle East, the\r\nSudan believes that a comprehensive, just and lasting peace\r\ncannot be achieved without a total commitment to the\r\nprinciples of justice and the complete preservation of the\r\nrights of the Palestinian people and the Arab States in the\r\nregion, or without a commitment to the agreements and\r\naccords reached by the parties concerned. Israel should\r\nabandon its settlement policies and withdraw from the all\r\nthe occupied Arab territories on the basis of the relevant\r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, which\r\ncontinue to be the point of reference for a peaceful\r\nsettlement and for the achievement of a comprehensive\r\npeace in the Middle East.\r\nWe agree with what the Secretary-General stated in\r\nhis report to the tenth emergency special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly about the seriousness of the situation\r\nin the region. The Secretary-General warned of the\r\nconsequences of the settlement policies in the occupied\r\nArab territories and the attempts to effect demographic\r\nand legal changes in Al-Quds aimed at its Judaization and\r\nthe alteration of its legal, geographical, historical,\r\nreligious and civilizational status. The Sudan calls upon\r\nthe international community to shoulder its responsibilities\r\nin the face of the deterioration of the situation and the\r\nescalation of confrontation to save the region from the\r\nspectre of war that appears over the horizon as a result of\r\nthe unacceptable Israeli practices. Furthermore, the Sudan\r\nis strongly opposed to Israeli attempts to impose\r\ncollective sanctions on the Palestinian people whatever\r\nthe justification or the pretext.\r\nIn the domain of international relations, the Sudan\r\nfollows policies and holds firm positions based on its\r\ncommitment to international and regional charters, the\r\nrespect of good- neighbourliness and regional cooperation\r\nand the suppression of terrorism and threats to regional\r\nand international security.\r\nThe Sudan continues to call for the abandonment of\r\nconflict and for regarding the interest of peoples as a\r\npriority that supersedes transient disagreements.\r\nThe application of the slogans of pluralism and\r\ndemocracy that characterize the present epoch in the\r\nprogress of humanity essentially requires respect for the\r\ndiverse cultural contexts of the peoples of the world.\r\nThose cultures should be allowed the opportunity of free\r\nand equitable self-expression in order to enrich human\r\nexperience and elevate the values of tolerance and\r\nacceptance of the other. That would lead to the restriction\r\nof recourse to violent and extreme expressions of injustice\r\nresulting from isolation and cultural arrogance.\r\nAll religions uphold the principles of tolerance, the\r\nacceptance of pluralism and coexistence with others. The\r\nHoly Koran says:\r\n“Say Ye: We believe in Allah and the revelation\r\nGiven to us, and to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob,\r\nand the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus,\r\nand that given to all Prophets from their Lord: We\r\nmake no difference Between one and another of\r\nthem: And we submit to Allah.\u0027” (The Holy Koran,\r\nII:136).\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nIn this context, we support the statement of the\r\nGerman Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the need to\r\nencourage dialogue between civilizations to replace\r\nconflicts and rivalry, in order to build a world of tolerance\r\nand cooperation and so that slogans of pluralism and\r\ndemocracy may not themselves become a pretext for\r\ncultural hegemony.\r\nThe adoption by the United Nations of the idea of\r\nsetting up a body to promote dialogue between religions\r\nand civilizations would pave the way for the realization of\r\nthat noble objective and would reinstate respect for lofty\r\nmoral values. It would act as a strong deterrent to such\r\nsocial ills as drug abuse, the escalation of violence and\r\nterrorism and family disintegration, thus clearing the way\r\nfor a better future for humanity as it enters a new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. David Levy.\r\nMr. Levy (Israel) (spoke in Hebrew; interpretation\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I would like to begin by\r\ncongratulating the President on his unanimous election to\r\npreside over the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at this\r\nsession the Assembly will be successful in bringing nations\r\ncloser to each other and in finding ways to address the\r\nchallenges that face all countries and nations, north and\r\nsouth, east and west.\r\nI also wish to congratulate his predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the manner in\r\nwhich he carried out his duties.\r\nWe mark this year the twentieth anniversary of the\r\npeace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel,\r\nMenachem Begin, and the late President of Egypt, Anwar\r\nSadat. Those leaders, with their historic decision and their\r\ncourageous leadership, pioneered the way towards the first\r\npeace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour, Egypt.\r\nThroughout their entire history, the people of Israel\r\nhave aspired to live in peace. Together with our constant\r\ncall for peace with our neighbours, we have not spared any\r\neffort to seek, whether through direct or indirect contacts,\r\na partner in this effort. Today, too, we continue to seek\r\nchannels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.\r\nIn recent years, since 1991, after the principles for\r\nnegotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down at\r\nMadrid, we have achieved a number of important\r\nadvances with the establishment of full peace between\r\nIsrael and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the\r\nsigning of interim accords with the Palestinians.\r\nNevertheless, the road to full peace is still long, and\r\nnegotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria and\r\nLebanon still lie ahead of us.\r\nImmediately after the last elections, the Government\r\nof Israel accepted the need to continue to advance the\r\nOslo accords and has acted to implement them. In the\r\npast year we have spared no effort to implement those\r\naccords, but, unfortunately, the trust that is the lifeblood\r\nof the entire process has been undermined as a result of\r\nthe failure of the Palestinians to carry out their\r\ncommitments according to the agreements they have\r\nsigned.\r\nIn the past year, while pursuing these efforts, we\r\nhave endured many tests and have suffered ongoing\r\nterrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspiration\r\nfor peace, security and tranquillity has been stained by the\r\nshedding of innocent blood, by the murder of men,\r\nwomen and children cut down by barbaric terrorist\r\nattacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning over\r\nthe loss of those innocent lives, the hope for peace has\r\nnot been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens of\r\nIsrael.\r\nThe citizens of Israel have taken upon themselves\r\ngreat risks for peace, but there is none among them who\r\nis willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is being\r\ndemanded in the name of peace. We must break this\r\ntragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action in\r\nconfronting the terror that trust will be re-established and\r\nthe doubts regarding intentions be removed.\r\nAs I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session of\r\nthis Assembly, all Israel is united in its deep desire for\r\npeace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel, both\r\nright and left are united in this quest.\r\nIf trust can be restored, if the principle of reciprocity\r\nis honoured, it will be possible for us to proceed. We\r\nhave already proved our willingness to do so, through our\r\ndecisions and actions since taking office and in the\r\nsigning and implementation of the Hebron agreement in\r\nall its aspects.\r\nPeace cannot live side by side with continued\r\nincitement, hostility, violence and terror. Peace means, in\r\nessence, the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nviolence. Dialogue, negotiation, compromise and the\r\nhonouring of agreements — those are the path to peace.\r\nThese principles apply throughout the world and must\r\napply also in the Middle East. The existence of two parallel\r\ntracks, one on which negotiations are pursued while a\r\nsecond track of violence, terror and bloodshed continues\r\nunimpeded, is totally unacceptable. This is a direct\r\nchallenge and affront to the very concept of peace.\r\nTerror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is not\r\na spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seen\r\nterrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade of\r\ninnocent and peaceful organizations, charitable and welfare\r\norganizations, while under this cover they contribute to the\r\npreparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.\r\nTerror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at any\r\nmoment, whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who lie\r\nin its path.\r\nThose who resort to terror are seeking not only to kill\r\nIsraelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot be\r\naccepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. It\r\nmust be rejected, absolutely and unequivocally, and it must\r\nbe fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under its\r\nconstant threat.\r\nThe words of the President of the United States and of\r\nthe Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a few\r\ndays ago are important and should guide us all in this\r\nmatter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from this\r\nvery rostrum:\r\n“terrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable\r\npolitical act.” [See Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th\r\nmeeting]\r\nThus, the international community bears the responsibility\r\nfor ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support,\r\nrecognition or legitimacy, not even implicitly.\r\nIn the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority\r\nand Arafat, its leader, undertook in the name of the\r\nPalestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed this\r\ncommitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement, again\r\none year ago at the Washington summit and again in the\r\nHebron agreement. Much to our consternation, it has been\r\nproved that this commitment has not been upheld as\r\nrequired, thus causing the present crisis of confidence.\r\nIsrael stands firmly upon its call to the Palestinian\r\nAuthority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly against\r\nterror. The Authority must act jointly and in full\r\ncooperation with us against terrorism and violence. We\r\nseek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely the\r\nimplementation of signed agreements. The fight against\r\nterror, in our humble opinion, is also in the Palestinian\r\ninterest.\r\nIn response to the repeated crises in the process\r\ncaused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to live\r\nup to its commitments, Israel proposes a binding code of\r\nconduct for relations between us. This code should\r\ninclude, first, the rejection of violence as a means for\r\nachieving political goals; secondly, preservation of the\r\nframework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrain\r\nfrom attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations onto\r\nthe international stage; thirdly, the institutionalization of\r\npermanent channels of communication, including in times\r\nof crisis; fourthly, a cessation of incitement and the call\r\nto violence and jihad, and their replacement with the\r\nlanguage of reconciliation and mutual respect; and, fifthly,\r\nthe advancement and encouragement of normalization and\r\nsupport for regional activities.\r\nThe purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitate\r\nuninterrupted negotiations and crisis management, and to\r\ncreate an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respond\r\nto the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believe\r\nthat the adoption of the above principles will allow us to\r\novercome the present crisis and help in preventing future\r\nones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the game\r\nwill also contribute to renewed trust between the leaders\r\nand greater confidence between the peoples.\r\nIn the wake of the visit to the Middle East of the\r\nUnited States Secretary of State, renewed agreement has\r\nbeen reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peace\r\nprocess to its proper track. We have been conducting\r\nintensive talks in recent days, with the assistance of the\r\nUnited States, both in Washington and here, with a view\r\nto resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts to\r\nreach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.\r\nIsrael values and appreciates the action of the United\r\nStates Secretary of State and her commitment and efforts\r\nto extricate the peace process from its current impasse, to\r\nbring the parties closer together and to ensure the success\r\nof the negotiations. We are fully committed to these\r\nefforts.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nIsrael reaffirms its proposal to conduct accelerated\r\nnegotiations, according to an agreed timetable, on\r\npermanent status. We propose conducting negotiations in\r\nwhich the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes and\r\nthe way towards achieving them. This proposal is intended\r\nto hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement, not to\r\ndelay it. This is also our call and our proposal to the\r\nPalestinian Authority.\r\nThe international community can play an important\r\nrole in facilitating the dialogue between the sides, which\r\nwill make it possible for us to resolve our differences\r\nthrough direct negotiations. It is only through direct\r\nnegotiations that we can bring this process to a successful\r\nconclusion. One-sided international declarations, dictates or\r\npressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize the\r\ndispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to the\r\nUnited Nations and other international forums only serve to\r\ncreate unnecessary obstacles and to make already\r\nentrenched positions more rigid.\r\nThe comprehensive peace we yearn for will not be\r\nachieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria and\r\nLebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings and\r\nagreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and to\r\nresolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect to\r\nfind in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search for\r\na just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice in\r\nfavour of peace — the “peace of the brave”, as claimed by\r\nits leadership — then we must explore together every\r\npossible avenue, at any place and at any time, for renewing\r\nthe talks between us.\r\nIsrael cannot accept the continued violence and terror\r\non its northern border. The terrorist activities of\r\norganizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusha\r\nrockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear the\r\nthreat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.\r\nThere is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.\r\nWe wish to see a sovereign, free and independent Lebanon\r\nacting determinedly against the terrorist organizations that\r\noperate from its territory.\r\nIf we are to reach peace, we cannot make do only\r\nwith agreements and contracts. The reality of peace means\r\nnormalization, open borders, freedom of movement,\r\ncommerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entire\r\nregion. These are the soul and essence of peace.\r\nNormalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.\r\nThe decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab\r\nLeague at their recent meeting in Cairo, just over one week\r\nago, stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations for\r\npeace and undermine its foundations. The attempts to\r\nprevent normalization with Israel, to freeze the level of\r\nexisting relations with it, to close liaison and interests\r\noffices between Israel and Arab neighbours and to\r\nreactivate the Arab boycott add up, in practice, to a\r\nboycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy which\r\nis reversing the process.\r\nThe ongoing and intentional freeze of the\r\nmultilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on the\r\nentrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meant\r\nand should serve as a platform and incentive for building\r\npeace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateral\r\nchannels alike and not make one conditional upon the\r\nother, nor create further obstacles and barriers on the road\r\nto peace. The question mark hanging over the regional\r\neconomic conference scheduled to take place later this\r\nyear in Doha, Qatar, is further evidence of this negative\r\ndrive.\r\nThe countries of the Middle East that are party to\r\nthe peace effort have a common interest in regional\r\nstability and the advancement of prosperity and well-\r\nbeing for all the nations of the region. We face together\r\nthe growing shortage of water and the ever-expanding\r\ndesert. We are also facing dangers from within our region\r\nthat threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes of\r\nvarious nations and to plunge the entire region into\r\nviolence, war and bloodshed.\r\nIt was only a few years ago that the entire world\r\nwas forced into forming a coalition to combat an\r\naggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouring\r\ncountry and to terrorize our entire region. Today, we face\r\nnew and even more extreme dangers, but the lessons of\r\nrecent experience have not been learned and many\r\ncountries turn a blind eye to the threat.\r\nThe leadership of Iran continues to speak in terms\r\nthat threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.\r\nYet the international community continues to remain deaf\r\nand refuses to speak out against Iran\u0027s policies,\r\ndeclarations and actions.\r\nIran\u0027s efforts, like those of Iraq, to acquire\r\noperational weapons of mass destruction of all kinds\r\nrepresent the greatest threat to security and stability in the\r\nMiddle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran\u0027s\r\nweapons programme extend far beyond the geographical\r\nconfines of our region. They threaten the security of other\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nmembers of the international community and their interests.\r\nIsrael reiterates its call to the members of the\r\ninternational family of nations — and at their head the\r\nUnited States, Russia and the members of the European\r\nUnion and of the Commonwealth of Independent States —\r\nto exercise the full weight of their influence and to take\r\nconcrete steps to prevent this development, which\r\nrepresents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.\r\nAfter the establishment, as we hope, of peace treaties\r\nbetween Israel and every country of the region, it will be\r\npossible to create a regional security system that would\r\nprovide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of\r\nsecurity problems in the Middle East, including a mutually\r\nand effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical,\r\nbiological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. These\r\nare our goals and we must act to achieve them.\r\nIsrael is an active and responsible member of the\r\nfamily of nations represented in this body. However, 50\r\nyears after the United Nations adopted, on 29 November\r\n1947, the resolution calling for the establishment of the\r\nState of Israel, we are still denied our equal rights in this\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe attach great importance to the fundamental reform\r\nof the United Nations work. We also share the opinion of\r\nother United Nations Member countries that believe that the\r\nOrganization urgently requires greater efficiency and a\r\nredirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards its\r\ntruly important tasks. At the same time, we are convinced\r\nthat no reform can be completed so long as the question of\r\nIsrael\u0027s membership of a regional group remains unresolved.\r\nWe call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.\r\nMuch to our chagrin, in the last year we have seen an\r\nintensification of the political campaign waged against\r\nIsrael at the United Nations. This campaign only impedes\r\nthe peace process and further undermines confidence\r\nbetween the parties. We call upon the Member States to\r\nrefrain from lending their support to such resolutions. The\r\ntime has come for this Assembly to reduce the number of\r\nresolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year and\r\nto contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conducive\r\nto direct negotiations between the parties.\r\nAs part of Israel\u0027s international and regional\r\ncommitment and of its credo as a State, we are engaged in\r\ncooperative programmes with many countries, with which\r\nwe share the experience and knowledge we have acquired\r\nin various fields. Israel attaches great importance to its\r\ninternational cooperation programme and to assisting\r\nvarious peoples to address the challenges of development\r\nand the hazards of nature, hunger and disease.\r\nOver more than three decades, tens of thousands of\r\ntrainees have participated in courses in Israel and in their\r\nown countries within the framework of Israel\u0027s\r\ncooperation and assistance programme in the fields of\r\neducation, health, agriculture, industry, social affairs and\r\nleadership. We are especially proud of the participation in\r\nrecent years of trainees from Arab countries, amongst\r\nthem Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries of\r\ngoodwill, ambassadors of peace, who bear with them the\r\nmessage and the great hope of human well-being. As in\r\nthe words of the prophet:\r\n“Each shall help his neighbour and make him\r\nstrong”.\r\nThis year, the Jewish people in Israel and around the\r\nworld marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty years\r\nago, the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty in\r\nits ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our\r\n2,000-year dispersion, we dreamt of the day that we\r\nwould renew our national life in the land of our\r\nforefathers, the land of Israel.\r\nIt is the privilege of our generation to fulfil this\r\naspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up its\r\nland. The Jewish people is once again gathering in its\r\nancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrant\r\nand democratic society, a flourishing economy, science,\r\nresearch and industry.\r\nFor the past 50 years, we have laboured to ensure\r\nIsrael\u0027s security and independence, while always seeking\r\npeace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fifty\r\nyears on, the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.\r\nThis week, we mark the beginning of the Jewish\r\nnew year. At this holy time, every Jew turns his eye\r\ntowards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for the\r\npeace of the world, the end of misery and a new dawn of\r\nhope for all. On this day of remembrance, the blow of the\r\nshofar is accompanied by the prayer:\r\n“may the year and its troubles pass and a new year\r\nand its blessings begin”.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nicolae Tabacaru.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nMr. Tabacaru (Republic of Moldova) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): Allow me at the outset to congratulate the\r\nPresident wholeheartedly on his election to the presidency\r\nof the fifty-second session of the General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations. I am especially pleased at the election of\r\na distinguished representative of Ukraine, a country which\r\nis a neighbour and friend of the Republic of Moldova, to\r\nthis important post. After declaring their independence six\r\nyears ago, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine worked to\r\ncreate prosperous and democratic societies. I am convinced\r\nthat the President, with his great skills and with the support\r\nof all the Member States, will be able to discharge with\r\ndistinction this lofty mission which has been entrusted to\r\nhim during this crucial period for the United Nations.\r\nI would also like to express my appreciation for the\r\ncontribution made by Mr. Razali Ismail in his capacity as\r\nPresident during the previous session. I wish also to express\r\nour gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis efforts to reform this global Organization.\r\nIt is my honour and privilege to address the General\r\nAssembly for the first time, and I would like to convey a\r\nmessage of friendship and solidarity from the people of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova.\r\nMy country, which is very much devoted to the ideals\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, strongly supports the\r\nreform process of the United Nations. That is why we have\r\ntaken note with interest of the reform programme proposed\r\nby the Secretary-General. This package of proposals is\r\ndesigned to achieve a reform in order to deal better with\r\nthe challenges of the coming millennium. We have\r\nwelcomed such initiatives and we support them.\r\nIt is clear that the reform of the United Nations can\r\nmove forward only if the financial crisis of the\r\nOrganization is settled. There is no doubt that Member\r\nStates must fulfil their financial obligations on time and in\r\nfull. At the same time, it is indeed necessary to reform the\r\nsystem for the payment of contributions in order to achieve\r\na fair assessment, one that better takes into account the\r\nprinciple of capacity to pay of each country. For our part,\r\nwe will spare no effort to honour our financial obligations.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova fully supports the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity. In the five years since our country was admitted\r\nto membership in the United Nations, we have co-\r\nsponsored several resolutions in this important field of\r\nactivity.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, last year the delegation\r\nof the Republic of Moldova likewise voted in favour of\r\nthe adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty. Consequently, I am pleased to report that on 24\r\nSeptember I signed this important Treaty on the complete\r\nban on nuclear testing. We are convinced that the\r\nimplementation of this Treaty can enhance international\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova also supports the efforts\r\nof the international community to limit the use of and\r\nultimately to eliminate certain conventional weapons\r\nwhich have injurious and indiscriminate effects, including\r\nanti-personnel landmines. We are ready to contribute to\r\nthe efforts being made to obtain these objectives.\r\nThe positive developments which have characterized\r\nthe activity of the Organization in recent years have\r\nbrought about certain concepts and the diversification of\r\nmechanisms for action in the field of international peace\r\nand security. Some of these mechanisms could be\r\nimplemented soon. Perhaps I need not stress here the\r\nusefulness and benefits of the United Nations standby\r\nforces, which all Member States welcome. Yet, I wish to\r\nemphasize that the Republic of Moldova would like to\r\ncontribute to this system and that last year our\r\nGovernment expressed its readiness to take part in the\r\nUnited Nations standby forces. That is why my country\r\nintends to provide to the United Nations Secretariat as\r\nsoon as possible information concerning contingents and\r\nequipment which are available for this purpose.\r\nMoreover, the Republic of Moldova is considering\r\nthe possibility of taking part in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. We believe that our country has\r\nalready accumulated a certain amount of experience in\r\nthis field through its participation in a variety of\r\ninternational manoeuvres.\r\nMilitant separatism has become one of the main\r\nthreats to international peace and security after the cold\r\nwar period. Totalitarian regimes have engendered ethnic\r\nconflicts and frictions in certain countries of Central and\r\nEastern Europe. Some conflicts are rooted in age-old\r\nanimosities. Others, as is the case in the conflict involving\r\nthe Republic of Moldova which broke out five years ago,\r\nare inspired by and supported from the outside, in order\r\nto recreate a form of by-gone domination.\r\nThis is the reason why I would like to emphasize the\r\nfact that the recent separatist trends which have appeared\r\nin the newly independent States who are Members of the\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nUnited Nations have nothing in common with the legitimate\r\naspiration of peoples to achieve self-determination. In our\r\nview, attempts to construe the right to self-determination as\r\nthe right of an ethnic or national community to establish its\r\nown government and to splinter off are real dangers to\r\ninternational and regional security. Moreover, the right to\r\nself-determination is treated in the Charter of the United\r\nNations as a principle which cannot serve to justify the\r\nviolation of the principle of the independence and territorial\r\nintegrity of a State. Nevertheless, it is imperative to define\r\nthis principle of self-determination more precisely in order\r\nto avoid any subjective interpretations.\r\nIt is quite clear that the stability of small and large\r\nStates hinges on a number of factors, such as the rule of\r\nlaw, respect for human rights, democracy and economic\r\ndevelopment. Our Government is therefore striving to\r\nestablish an equitable social system based on the respect for\r\nthe dignity of the human person. And yet, the process of\r\neconomic reform, with all its inherent problems, is retarding\r\nthe achievement of these objectives.\r\nThe high social costs of transition are felt throughout\r\nsociety. Despite all of these difficulties, we are nevertheless\r\ndetermined to continue the process of economic reform. We\r\nrely on the support of developed countries, the United\r\nNations and other international agencies and organizations\r\nduring this decisive moment in the reform of our country.\r\nI take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the people\r\nand Government of my country to those States and\r\ninternational institutions which have supported the\r\nstrengthening of democracy and market-economy\r\nmechanisms in our Republic. Furthermore, I note with\r\nsatisfaction that my country has made progress in building\r\nits civil society and in establishing democratic institutions.\r\nNevertheless, it is a paradox that under such\r\nfavourable conditions we have not succeeded in achieving\r\na final settlement of the conflict which broke out in the\r\nsummer of 1992. Yet, the authorities of the Republic of\r\nMoldova endeavour to find pragmatic solutions in order to\r\nmaintain the integrity of the country.\r\nFollowing negotiations with the leaders of the\r\nseparatist region, and with the mediation of the Russian\r\nFederation, Ukraine and the mission of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, an agreement was\r\nreached between the parties involved with regard to the\r\ngeneral principles of the settlement of the dispute. A\r\nmemorandum was likewise signed on the normalization of\r\nrelations between the authorities of the Republic of\r\nMoldova and the Transdnestrian region.\r\nAt the same time, the Presidents of Ukraine and the\r\nRussian Federation and the Chairman-in-Office of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) signed a joint Declaration emphasizing the\r\nimportance of the parties\u0027 commitment in the\r\nmemorandum to conduct their relations in the context of\r\nthe existing borders of the country by granting special\r\nstatus to the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nIn view of the provisions of the memorandum, an ad\r\nhoc commission was established to negotiate the legal\r\nstatus of the Transdniester region. To our regret,\r\nnegotiations in the Commission are deadlocked because\r\nof the intransigent and highly politicized position taken by\r\nthe Transdniester side. Therefore, no mutually acceptable\r\nsolution has been found on the key elements for resolving\r\nthe dispute, namely, the legal definition of the status of\r\nTransdniester and the powers of the parties during the\r\ntransitional period. In opposing the provisions of the\r\naccord, the Transdniester side insists on a settlement\r\nwhich runs counter to the Constitution of the Republic of\r\nMoldova and is prejudicial to the principle of sovereignty\r\nover the territory of the country. Despite the commitments\r\nthey assumed by signing the memorandum, the separatist\r\nleaders have, exceeding their power, enacted certain\r\nunconstitutional laws establishing a so-called customs\r\nborder in Transdniester and a “commission for the\r\ndelimitation of the State border in the region”. In\r\naddition, a series of unlawful acts have been committed\r\nin the area controlled by the peacekeeping forces.\r\nI must therefore emphasize that it is vital to ensure\r\nmore active mediation by the Russian Federation, Ukraine\r\nand the OSCE mission, as well as stronger action by the\r\ninternational community, led by the United Nations. I\r\nshould like to say the conflict in Transdniester could\r\ndestabilize the political and military situation, and\r\nthreatens subregional and regional peace and security. We\r\nknow that the separatist regime in Transdniester is\r\nsupported by a powerful paramilitary force having the\r\nmost modern weapons, obtained from the equipment\r\navailable to forces of the Russian Federation illegally\r\nstationed on our territory. At the same time, the leaders\r\nof those opposed to constitutional authority are trying to\r\nobtain weapons belonging to the Russian military forces,\r\nwhile opposing the complete withdrawal of the troops of\r\nthe Russian Federation and their weapons. It must\r\ntherefore be pointed out that disarming and breaking up\r\nthe Transdniester paramilitary groups is as important as\r\nthe withdrawal of Russian troops.\r\nBoth those processes must be monitored by\r\ninternational observers. We have reached the conclusion\r\nthat an immediate and effective solution to this conflict\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nrequires more active involvement by international bodies as\r\nwell as the countries of the region and even the major\r\nPowers. We are awaiting such involvement, for our recent\r\nexperience demonstrates that all attempts made by the\r\nauthorities of the Republic of Moldova to settle the conflict\r\nin the Transdniester region through dialogue and\r\nnegotiations have failed. The interests of the separatist\r\nleaders are subordinate to other interests, entirely political,\r\ngoing beyond our national context.\r\nThere is a danger that the conflict will continue\r\nindefinitely. We believe that the problem of the eastern\r\nregion of the Republic of Moldova could already have been\r\nresolved by peaceful means and in a civilized fashion if the\r\nseparatist regime did not receive strong support from\r\noutside. More often than not such support has been given\r\ndeliberately, for reasons of geopolitical interests, but\r\nsometimes the separatists in the eastern region of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova have received unintentional, indirect\r\nsupport through the unlawful trade activities of companies\r\nand firms in developed countries. We hope that the\r\nGovernments of countries where certain undertakings are\r\ngiving political and technical support to the separatist\r\nregime in Transdniester will put an end to such activity.\r\nThese actions can no longer be tolerated for they constitute\r\nipso facto direct interference in the internal affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova.\r\nThe illegal stationing of military contingents of the\r\nRussian Federation on the territory of my country\r\ncontinues. The deadline set by the 1994 Moldovan-Russian\r\nAgreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the\r\nterritory is 21 October 1997. The fact that for three years\r\nthe State Duma, unlike our Parliament, has failed to ratify\r\nthe Agreement cannot be excused or explained. We have\r\nbeen assured on several occasions, at the highest level, that\r\nthe question of the withdrawal of troops will be settled, and\r\nit is regrettable that this problem remains unresolved.\r\nWe understand, of course, that the failure to ratify the\r\n1994 Accord by the State Duma entails legal complications\r\nfor the Russian Government. However, we believe that the\r\ntime has come to find a solution to the question of troop\r\nwithdrawal. In accordance with the principles of\r\ninternational law, no foreign army can be stationed on the\r\nterritory of another State without its free consent. In\r\naddition, international organizations, particularly the OSCE,\r\nstrongly support the unconditional, immediate, orderly and\r\ncomplete withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of\r\nthe Republic of Moldova. Finally, Russia\u0027s admission to the\r\nCouncil of Europe as a fully fledged member, was\r\nconditional on the timely withdrawal of its troops from the\r\nterritory of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nWe believe that the political forces in the State\r\nDuma opposing troop withdrawal will also be sensitive to\r\nthe legal commitments of the Russian Federation. We\r\nhope that the removal of armaments and the withdrawal\r\nof troops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova\r\nwill be speeded up and completed as soon as possible.\r\nThis course would certainly serve the interests of both\r\ncountries and would properly reflect the high level\r\nreached in the development of relations between the\r\nRepublic of Moldova and the Russian Federation.\r\nIn conclusion, I express the fervent hope that the\r\nwork of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly\r\nwill take place in a climate of solidarity, with a realistic\r\nand constructive approach to the complex problems facing\r\nthe world at the end of this century. My delegation, like\r\nthose of other Member States, is ready to make its\r\ncontribution to achieve the purposes of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
