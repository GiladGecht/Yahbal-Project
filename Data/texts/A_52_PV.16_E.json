(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by General Hugo Banzer Suárez, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the Constitutional President of the Republic of\r\nBolivia.\r\nGeneral Hugo Banzer Suárez, Constitutional President\r\nof the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Bolivia, His\r\nExcellency General Hugo Banzer Suárez, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Banzer Suárez (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me to convey the congratulations of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Bolivia to you,\r\nMr. President. Your well-deserved election is fitting\r\nrecognition of your work and prestige.\r\nAllow me also to commend the work of Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, who so ably conducted the\r\ndeliberations of the previous session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFinally, my congratulations go as well to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, whose contributions to the cause of\r\nworld peace and cooperation have earned him the\r\nunanimous gratitude of the Member States of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nAll the countries of Latin America, in one way or\r\nanother and each at its own pace, have put long decades\r\nof ideological confrontation and economic crisis behind\r\nthem. They have opened their markets, controlled\r\ninflation, reduced the deficit and privatized public\r\nenterprises. They have rebuilt their democratic\r\ninstitutional structures on new foundations, with new\r\nprotagonists, and restarted the process of growth.\r\nHowever, old structural adjustment problems,\r\naggravated by the period of crisis, have surfaced. Clearly\r\nthe most important of these is the inequitable distribution\r\nof income and its results: exclusion, poverty, violence and\r\nsocial fragmentation. Such inequities have created ever-\r\ngreater gaps between the immensely rich and those who\r\nhave barely enough to survive. There are no social\r\nsecurity systems to protect the dispossessed, to cushion\r\ntheir fall and rehabilitate them so that they can live a\r\nproductive life. For this reason, the potential for violence\r\nand discontent on our continent is growing larger and\r\nmore dangerous.\r\nThese factors aside, however, Latin America meets\r\nall of the necessary conditions to forge ahead and grow in\r\nthat it has the capacity and courage to continue to\r\nchange — to increase society’s store of knowledge, create\r\nnew competitive advantages, eliminate internal\r\nmarginalization, reduce extreme poverty, rebuild the State,\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nand speak with its own voice in the world political\r\ncommunity.\r\nEducation stands out as a vital precondition for all of\r\nthese goals. Without a far-reaching revolution in the area of\r\neducation, we will not be able to achieve these goals or\r\nmeet the challenges of our time.\r\nToday, Latin America is no longer asking others for\r\nwhat it cannot do on its own. Proof of this is the significant\r\nprogress recently made in strengthening mechanisms for\r\neconomic integration, such as the Andean Group and the\r\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). The\r\nregion is also taking a different approach in its relations\r\nwith the economically advanced countries. The old\r\ndefensive and mistrustful attitude has yielded to the\r\nconviction that it is necessary to merge Latin America’s\r\neconomy into the contemporary current of productive and\r\ntechnological development, attract investments and open its\r\nmarkets to its products while preserving its identity,\r\nupholding its values and attending to its interests, without\r\nfor an instant losing sight of the fact that the key to its\r\nstrength lies in its own markets and in its resources.\r\nLet me reiterate Bolivia’s concern about landmines. It\r\nis incomprehensible that those very same borders across\r\nwhich we are seeking to promote trade and integration\r\nshould be sown with devices of war that endanger the\r\ncivilian population and threaten their fundamental rights.\r\nWe are convinced that the Governments of the region\r\ndirectly affected by the problem will find a way to resolve\r\nit.\r\nThis matter is of particular and direct relevance to\r\nBolivia, due to the well-known and acknowledged fact that\r\nChile has laid a significant number of mines along our\r\ncommon border. Removal of those mines is of the utmost\r\nurgency, in keeping with the commitments entered into in\r\nOslo, the dictates of morality and the imperative of the\r\nspirit of integration that should prevail between\r\nneighbouring nations. Avoidance of this topic is not the\r\nattitude that the international community wishes to see.\r\nWhat is needed is firm resolve and the sincere will to\r\ncontribute to peace between countries that must impart a\r\nsense of solidarity to their borders.\r\nSince the early days of its independence, Bolivia has\r\nrejected the use of force and the arms race as an instrument\r\nof its foreign policy. We have the moral authority,\r\ntherefore, to condemn those commercial interests that seek\r\nto foster the procurement of war matériel, thereby\r\ncompromising what we have achieved so far in terms of\r\npreserving peace on the continent.\r\nI have sought to describe the process of change in\r\nLatin America in order to show the extent to which\r\ndevelopments in each of our countries are part of a\r\nbroader and more comprehensive historical trend.\r\nHowever, Bolivia’s transformation has its own particular\r\nfeatures. Following a lengthy process of social\r\nconfrontation, we have restored democracy and economic\r\nfreedoms in Bolivia. In a spirit of respect for human\r\nrights and freedoms, we have given full support to the\r\npolitical system and fuelled the economic growth and\r\ndevelopment that prevail today in Bolivia. It should be\r\nunderscored that this was a peaceful reconstruction\r\nprocess — the result of democratic dialogue.\r\nMy Government, the product of a mandate of the\r\npeople, represents more than 70 per cent of the Bolivian\r\nelectorate. Nonetheless, we must continue to move\r\nforward and broaden the scope of dialogue and consensus,\r\ninvolving social institutions and their leaders in the task\r\nof identifying the main objectives of development in\r\nBolivia as well as the broad outlines of our strategy for\r\nthe twenty-first century. That is the purpose of the\r\nnational dialogue that I have recently called for, which\r\nhas the support of all the political parties — Government\r\nand opposition; the church; private enterprise; and farmers\r\nand workers.\r\nOf course, this new country we are building is\r\nlooking to the future from a different perspective and with\r\na sense of renewed confidence. The time has come to\r\nreaffirm Bolivia’s role on our continent — its role as a\r\ncrossroads and as a land of contacts, at the juncture of the\r\ngreat basins and the great cultures of America. Bolivia’s\r\nkey geographical position may become one of its major\r\ncomparative advantages and an essential element in\r\nenhancing the country’s international stature.\r\nHowever, this is not yet a reality. It is a task that\r\nremains to be accomplished, a promise that remains to be\r\nfulfilled. To this end, Bolivia will need to rebuild its\r\nmaritime capacity; reduce the transportation cost of its\r\nproducts; and create a modern export sector and connect\r\nit with the Pacific and the Atlantic. We must see and\r\nunderstand our country as a part of the continent.\r\nBolivia’s association with MERCOSUR is not only\r\nthe result of a desire to cultivate a historical friendship\r\nbut also a consequence of the concrete needs of Bolivian\r\ndevelopment. The exceptional growth in the eastern areas\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nof Bolivia calls for a more intense and productive\r\nrelationship with our neighbours on the Atlantic.\r\nThat effort coincides with one of the most impressive\r\ndevelopment ventures in the history of America, which is\r\ntaking place now on the territories of Brazil, Bolivia,\r\nParaguay, Argentina and Uruguay. Investments and\r\ntechnology must be allowed to flow freely in that region.\r\nWe must set up a genuine common market, a multinational\r\ndevelopment project, around this potential, which should\r\nalso promote the integration of our countries into the world\r\neconomy. It is well known that the Paraguay-Paraná\r\nwaterway is the natural route linking the area.\r\nThat major project, however, has already gone beyond\r\nthe imagination of the visionaries and the negotiating tables\r\nof the diplomats. It is now in the hands of engineers and\r\nworkers. After more than 30 years of efforts, construction\r\nhas begun on the Santa Cruz-San Pablo-Curitiba gas\r\npipeline, the first segment of a network of energy\r\ndistribution for which Bolivia’s territory provides the\r\ncrossroads. This is one of the largest engineering projects\r\nin the history of the region. It will stretch for more than\r\n3,000 kilometres, will carry more than 7 billion cubic feet\r\nof natural gas over 20 years and will require a total\r\ninvestment of nearly $5 billion.\r\nBolivia’s very existence is directly tied to the Pacific.\r\nAccordingly, we have been following with great interest the\r\nprocess of consolidating the vast potential of the Andean\r\ncommunity. That potential is also found in our immediate\r\nvicinity. The economies of Bolivia, Peru and Chile are\r\ncomplementary.\r\nOur territories are not only markets, but avenues for\r\nintegration. The territories of Peru and Chile hold Bolivia’s\r\ngateway to the Pacific, while that of Bolivia opens up\r\ncommunication between those nations and the vast interior\r\nof the continent.\r\nI must stress, however, that the reality still falls far\r\nshort of the potential. The reason for this is to be found in\r\na war that took place just over 100 years ago, and whose\r\nadverse consequences continue to be felt in the relations\r\nbetween our countries. Undoubtedly, the most unjust and\r\nserious of those consequences is the geographical enclosure\r\nimposed upon Bolivia.\r\nBolivia’s demand to return to the Pacific Ocean, with\r\nsovereign rights and a coastline of its own cannot be\r\nrenounced. It is a vital condition for our national\r\ndevelopment but, above all, a historical claim that cannot be\r\ncompromised. The recovery of our maritime access,\r\ntemporarily lost, is an essential condition for fulfilling our\r\ncontinental role as a crossroads and a point of\r\nconvergence. My country will turn to the international\r\ncommunity as many times as necessary in order to call\r\nattention to a problem that has already been deemed a\r\nmatter of permanent hemispheric interest in the light of its\r\nmany implications for continental security and harmony.\r\nDespite everything, my Government, as always, remains\r\nready to explore avenues of constructive dialogue with an\r\nopen mind.\r\nIllicit drug trafficking unjustly distorts the reality of\r\nBolivia and affects and interferes with the proper conduct\r\nof external cooperation. Bolivia itself has done a great\r\ndeal to contain this problem. It has not permitted drug\r\ntrafficking to taint beyond repair its economic,\r\ninstitutional and political structure. And it has done so\r\npeacefully, without resorting to violence. Nevertheless, the\r\nstigma of drug trafficking exists, and while we are\r\ndisturbed by the manner in which it is magnified, it would\r\nbe a mistake to ignore it.\r\nAccordingly, my Government has taken the decision\r\nto remove Bolivia from the drug-trafficking circuit within\r\nthe term of my administration. We shall use dialogue and\r\nconsultation with peasant producers of coca in order\r\ndefinitively to eradicate illegal crops. We shall be ruthless\r\nwith the drug traffickers. We shall not give them a\r\nmoment’s rest until they have been for ever banned from\r\nthe history of Bolivia.\r\nNaturally, this is not an exclusively Bolivian\r\nproblem, nor can our actions alone resolve the global and\r\nhemispheric problem of illegal trafficking in narcotics. It\r\nis a matter that concerns all and that requires everyone’s\r\ncommitment. Therefore, the time has come to reaffirm the\r\nprinciples of shared responsibility. The characteristics and\r\nscope of this problem mean that it cannot be faced\r\neffectively through isolated efforts. It undeniably calls for\r\nresolute action by all countries, especially those affected\r\nby consumption and who have sufficient economic\r\nresources to combat this terrible evil.\r\nMy country reaffirms its commitment to the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East in keeping with the principles\r\nand values that guide harmonious coexistence between\r\npeoples. However, given the resurgence of tensions and\r\nnew acts of confrontation, we call upon the parties not to\r\ngo back on the commitments already made. That is the\r\nfirm answer for maintaining peace in the region.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nIn another vein, Bolivia has received with satisfaction\r\nthe Secretary-General’s initiative proposing a broad\r\nprogramme of reforms in the United Nations system. We\r\nfeel it is essential to strengthen the role of the Secretariat.\r\nWe reiterate the importance of the process of expansion and\r\nreform of the Security Council with a view to correcting\r\npresent imbalances, guaranteeing equitable and non-\r\ndiscriminatory geographical distribution, improving its\r\ndecision-making mechanisms and making it an organ that\r\ncan take action in a manner that is increasingly legitimate\r\nand representative of the countries that make up the United\r\nNations. Bolivia shares the view that we should move\r\ntowards the elimination of the veto, limiting its use in the\r\ninterim to issues considered under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter.\r\nBolivia reiterates its commitment to the principles that\r\nhave guided global solidarity for more than 50 years. We\r\nBolivians believe that there can be no relinquishing of the\r\nstandards that establish mutual respect and the sovereign\r\nequality of States, regardless of their size or level of\r\ndevelopment. Nor can we surrender the principles of\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, the inviolability and\r\nintegrity of territories and respect for self-determination of\r\npeoples that wish to preserve their own systems of life and\r\nGovernment, free from threats.\r\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the experience\r\nof the century now drawing to a close, it is the versatility\r\nof the human endeavour. Mankind has an incorrigible\r\ntendency to make mistakes, but also a talent for correcting\r\nthem and for building from the rubble the new portals of\r\nfreedom and faith.\r\nWith the approach of the new millennium, at an hour\r\nthat is both dusk and dawn, we must look upon the events\r\nof the world from the dual perspective of humility and\r\nhope.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Constitutional President of the Republic\r\nof Bolivia for the statement he has just made.\r\nGeneral Hugo Banzer Suárez, Constitutional President\r\nof the Republic of Bolivia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The next speaker on my list is\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Martin Andjaba, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Namibia. I give him the floor.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): I congratulate you, Sir, on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-second session. We have no doubt that your\r\ndiplomatic tact will steer the deliberations of this\r\nimportant session to a fruitful conclusion. My delegation\r\nwill lend you its full cooperation as you embark on the\r\ndifficult task ahead of you.\r\nLet me now pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail, your predecessor, who conducted our work during\r\nthe fifty-first session in a highly remarkable manner.\r\nOur tribute goes also to the former Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his distinguished\r\nleadership during his tenure. We are most grateful to him\r\nfor his tireless efforts in upholding the objectives of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe present Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nhails from a country that paved the road towards freedom\r\nand national independence in our part of the world. The\r\nfirst leader of his country, Mr. Kwame Nkrumah, was a\r\nmain catalyst in Africa’s fight against colonial\r\ndomination. We have no doubt that all these attributes,\r\ntogether with his long-standing experience in the affairs\r\nof the United Nations, will contribute to the revitalization\r\nand democratization of the Organization. We congratulate\r\nhim on his election as Secretary-General, and we assure\r\nhim of our full support and cooperation.\r\nAt the fiftieth session of the General Assembly,\r\nworld leaders recaptured the vision of the founding\r\nfathers of our Organization. They did so in recognition of\r\nthe need to map out the institutional framework and\r\noperational parameters necessary to forge the\r\neffectiveness and continued relevance of the United\r\nNations in this ever-changing international arena. It is that\r\nmomentum that must be the driving force in our quest for\r\na reformed, revitalized and democratized United Nations.\r\nReform is a process. As long as the United Nations\r\nexists and the world continues to change, reform will be\r\nnecessary. Namibia therefore welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report of 16 July 1997 on the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. Let me place on record that Namibia\r\nwelcomes and supports reform which enhances the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to effectively address the\r\ncritical development concerns of developing countries. In\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nthis context, let me emphasize that we attach utmost\r\nimportance to the operational activities of the United\r\nNations, for they complement our development efforts. Any\r\nreform in this area must strengthen their scope of\r\nexcellence. As the Secretary-General rightly puts it in his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, “times of\r\ntransformation can be times of confusion” [A/52/1, para.\r\n20]. Managerial issues, therefore, must not and cannot be\r\nconfused with policy matters. We have long recognized that\r\nit is the General Assembly that is best equipped by the\r\nCharter to provide the necessary representative leadership.\r\nAnd this authority of the General Assembly my delegation\r\nshall seek to uphold.\r\nReform must not be retrogressive. It must continue to\r\nenhance and build on those gains we have made over the\r\nyears. And, therefore, savings to be realized from reform\r\nmeasures should be channelled — and rightly so — to\r\n“the Organization’s highest priority, alleviating\r\npoverty and enhancing the prospects of developing\r\ncountries”. [A/51/950, letter of transmittal]\r\nThe recent reform proposals by the Secretary-General are,\r\nin our view, part of an ongoing process. We must not resist\r\nchange; nor should we lose sight of the long-term\r\nimplications of our actions of today. We need to do it now,\r\nbut we must do it right.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly, the current\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nPresident Robert Mugabe, reiterated the position of the\r\nOAU on the reform and democratization of the Security\r\nCouncil. Let me supplement his remarks by emphasizing\r\nthat Namibia is opposed to categories of permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council. As we continue to\r\nseek ways and means to reform the Security Council, we\r\nmust not replace a speedy process with haste. Hence, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil should be the forum to search for and reach a\r\nconsensus on the matter.\r\nWhat besets the United Nations today is not merely an\r\nunmanageable structure. The Organization is subjected to\r\nfinancial limitations. Reform cannot supplant the Charter\r\nobligation of Member States to honour their financial\r\nobligations. Voluntary contributions, therefore, must not be\r\nseen as a means to pave the way towards resolving the\r\ncurrent financial crisis. My Government welcomes the idea\r\nof the establishment of a revolving credit fund, capitalized\r\nat a level of up to $1 billion through voluntary\r\ncontributions or through other appropriate means which\r\nmay be agreed. However, our Organization can execute\r\nits mandate to the fullest only when all Member States\r\nequip it to do so. We all must honour our assessed\r\ncontributions in line with international agreements, not in\r\nline with unilateral decisions.\r\nThe creation of a development account is viewed by\r\nmy Government as a good idea. However, all mandated\r\nprogrammes and activities should be implemented,\r\nincluding reimbursement to troop contributors for United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, any\r\nreduction in posts must not compromise the effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations; more important, it must be carried\r\nout on the basis of geographical equity.\r\nSince 1996 we have witnessed positive progress in\r\nthe field of disarmament. A Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) has been concluded, and the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention has come into force. In\r\naddition, an agreement was reached by the parties to the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)\r\nand Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction to intensify\r\nefforts to negotiate verification provisions. However,\r\ndespite these developments, nuclear weapons and their\r\nproliferation continue to be a cause of concern to the\r\ninternational community. With the conclusion of the\r\nCTBT, it is still our hope that serious negotiations will\r\nbegin on the elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nIn this connection, we call upon the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to undertake, within the shortest possible time\r\nframe, to carry out effective nuclear disarmament\r\nmeasures. The total elimination of these weapons is the\r\nonly genuine guarantee for non-nuclear-weapon States\r\nagainst the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.\r\nNamibia is among many countries still facing the\r\nbitter experience of the effects of landmines, which have\r\nclaimed and continue to claim human lives, and which\r\npose serious obstacles to the reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment process. Thus, we support the international\r\ncommunity’s move towards a total ban on the use of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines and its continuous and tireless efforts\r\nacross the globe to clear minefields.\r\nIn this connection, we welcome the treaty recently\r\nconcluded in Oslo, Norway, to ban anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. Namibia is ready to sign the treaty in Ottawa.\r\nLet me express our profound gratitude and great\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nappreciation to those countries which are supporting\r\nNamibia’s demining activities, thus enhancing our\r\ndevelopment prospects.\r\nOur world is merging into one globally encompassing\r\ndynamo of change, or so it is perceived, characterized by\r\ninter alia economic integration. Are developing countries to\r\nbecome victims or beneficiaries of this process? Suffice it\r\nto emphasize that globalization and liberalization are not\r\nends in themselves. They are means to greater efficiency,\r\nhigher growth and increased welfare. It is common\r\nknowledge that the much talked about benefits of\r\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy\r\ncontinue to elude the majority of developing countries,\r\nparticularly those in Africa. At the same time, while the\r\ndebt burden continues to hamper many of the development\r\nefforts of our economies, official development assistance is\r\non the decline. Instead, new and innovative ideas for\r\ngenerating funds for globally agreed commitments and\r\npriorities are being brought into play, some of which are\r\nclearly shifting the overall burden of financing development\r\nto the developing countries which already have limited\r\nfinancial resources.\r\nNamibia is strongly of the view that if the twin\r\nprocess of globalization and liberalization of the world\r\neconomy is to benefit all countries, developing countries\r\nmust have free access to world markets without conditions.\r\nIt should not be a matter of the survival of the fittest. The\r\nlimitations of many of our countries to compete should be\r\ncompensated for by maintaining preferential treatment of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMuch has been said about global development trends,\r\nof Africa’s efforts to carve a larger slice of the world\r\neconomic cake, of our striving for economic empowerment\r\nand competitiveness, of our movement towards regional\r\nintegration and harmonization, and of our efforts to put in\r\nplace an enabling environment for trade, investment and\r\ncapital flows on a national and regional level.\r\nAt the same time, at the recent International Monetary\r\nFund Economic Forum it was said that over the decade\r\nspanning 1985 to 1995 developing countries increased their\r\nshare of world trade from 23 per cent to 29 per cent. They\r\nalso diversified their trade linkages in response to major\r\nchanges in trade and exchange regimes in the direction of\r\nmore outward-looking and open policies.\r\nWhile it is stated that developing countries have more\r\nthan doubled their real per capita income over the last 30\r\nyears, in reality only Asia has made relative progress; thus,\r\nthe gap in living standards between the advanced\r\neconomies and Africa continues to widen.\r\nThe distribution of gains from increases in both trade\r\nand foreign direct investment remains very skewed, with\r\na few getting the most. Africa still participates in world\r\ntrade with foreign direct investment flows of less than 4\r\nper cent.\r\nTherefore, as we continue to welcome the bright\r\nprojected global outlook, we should not lose sight of the\r\nwide divergence across nations and regions. Today, for\r\nmany African nations, global optimism coexists with local\r\npessimism. There is a need, then, to open and expand our\r\neconomies, to increase our competitiveness, to empower\r\nour people and to improve their well-being. To this end,\r\nthe international community should support Africa’s need\r\nto effectively participate in multilateral trade discussions,\r\nwith a strengthened capacity for negotiations in such\r\nforums. Full implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa is one effective\r\nway of addressing Africa’s limited capacity to take\r\nadvantage of the global outlook.\r\nWe in the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) have long recognized that the path\r\nto globalization is regional integration. To equalize power\r\nrelationships in the global setting, regional integration is\r\na strategic imperative. To this end, all the members of\r\nSADC have embarked upon a common strategy to\r\npromote the region as an attractive trading and investment\r\npartner, and they are actively working towards: deeper\r\neconomic cooperation and integration on the basis of\r\nbalance, equity and mutual respect, providing for cross-\r\nborder investment, trade and movement of production\r\nfactors and services; common economic, political and\r\nsocial value systems, enhancing entrepreneurship,\r\ncompetitiveness, democracy, good governance, rule of\r\nlaw, human rights and the eradication of poverty; and\r\nstrengthened regional solidarity, peace and security.\r\nWhile admittedly our region has not yet attracted a\r\nhigh share of foreign direct investment, political and\r\neconomic risks have greatly reduced over the past years,\r\nand increasing trade and investment flows are being\r\nwitnessed.\r\nNamibia, as a member of SADC, believes in the\r\nregion’s potential, the opportunities for joint development\r\nand the power of collective advocacy. This will enhance\r\nefforts towards the ideals and objectives of the African\r\nEconomic Community. Together we can strengthen our\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nproductivity and competitiveness in the global economy. By\r\npooling our resources and skills, we can create a far greater\r\nmarket for all of us than any of our nations has.\r\nFor the accelerated development process of developing\r\ncountries to take place, a strong industrial base is\r\nindispensable. In this regard, we continue to underscore the\r\nrole of the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO), which is an agency with a clear,\r\nvital and indispensable mission. UNIDO has successfully\r\ncarried out its reform, and this should be recognized and\r\nsupported. At this juncture, let me express Namibia’s great\r\nappreciation to the Government of the United Kingdom for\r\nits decision to rejoin UNIDO. We have no doubt that this\r\nexemplary decision will be rightly emulated by other\r\nMember States.\r\nThis year during the month of June major events were\r\nwitnessed here at the United Nations. The adoption of the\r\nAgenda for Development and the review and appraisal of\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 are cases in point. We\r\nview the outcome of these two events as complementary.\r\nNeither replaces the other. The commitments we made in\r\nRio remain valid and need full — not selective —\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe United Nations has a major role to play in\r\npromoting international cooperation. It took the Ad Hoc\r\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on an\r\nAgenda for Development four years to reach consensus.\r\nMobilization of resources for its implementation is of the\r\nutmost importance, for those who are to benefit from it\r\ncannot wait another four years. Development must be one\r\nof the centrepieces of United Nations activities. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the proposal to appoint a Deputy\r\nSecretary-General. In our view the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral should concentrate on United Nations development\r\nactivities.\r\nNamibia is one of those countries seriously affected by\r\ndesertification and drought. In a few days, the first\r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention\r\nto Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing\r\nSerious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in\r\nAfrica, will take place in Rome. We underscore the utmost\r\nimportance of establishing an independent financial\r\nmechanism to make arrangements conducive to the\r\nimplementation of this Convention. To this end, we look\r\nforward with great expectation to the outcome of the first\r\nConference of the Parties.\r\nNamibia supports the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court, with its jurisdiction being\r\nlimited to “hard-core crimes”: crimes of genocide, serious\r\nviolations of the laws and customs applicable in armed\r\nconflict and crimes against humanity. The principle of\r\ncomplementarity should be clearly spelled out in the\r\nstatute. The international criminal court must complement\r\nand not supplant national criminal jurisdictions. A balance\r\nbetween the international criminal court and the national\r\njurisdictions will therefore have to be struck in order to\r\nmake the international criminal court fully functional.\r\nWe are two years from the end of this century and\r\nthe beginning of a new millennium. We have the\r\nopportunity to reflect on how we have fared in elevating\r\nthe human race to greater heights. In this context, my\r\nGovernment would like to congratulate both Mrs. Mary\r\nRobinson, the new High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, and Mr. Olara Otunnu, the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Representative to study the impact of armed\r\nconflict on children. Both of them have challenging\r\nresponsibilities to assist Member States in very important\r\nbut difficult tasks.\r\nIn 1998 we will commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. The Government and people of Namibia have\r\nembraced the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\ninasmuch as our Constitution embodies those principles\r\nand values that we were denied for so long and that we\r\nwill cherish and pass on to new generations to come.\r\nFurthermore, 1998 will mark the fifth anniversary of the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights. This will be a time\r\nto reflect and to rededicate ourselves to our collective\r\nresponsibility to save successive generations from the\r\nscourge of massive and grave human rights violations.\r\nIt is also our responsibility to redouble our efforts\r\ntowards the implementation of the Declaration on the\r\nRight to Development as well as to pay equal attention to\r\nthe implementation of economic, social and cultural\r\nrights.\r\nNo country has been spared the onslaught of drug\r\ntrafficking and the alarming geographical spread of\r\norganized crime in its various forms. This undermines our\r\ndevelopment process and threatens human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, and thus causes regression in the\r\nquality of our lives. In this context, my Government\r\nsupports the convening of the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the question of drugs next year.\r\nThis will provide the international community with an\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nample opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to combat\r\nthis global problem.\r\nTime and again we have all affirmed the link between\r\npeace and development. In this context, we are pleased that\r\nthe United Nations has decided to discuss the concept of\r\nthe “culture of peace” during this session of the General\r\nAssembly. We support the current efforts before the United\r\nNations for a comprehensive strategy to be adopted towards\r\nthis end.\r\nMy delegation remains deeply perturbed by the\r\nsituation in Angola. In this regard, we feel strongly that the\r\nphasing out of a United Nations presence in Angola must\r\nhinge on the situation on the ground. The United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Angola was established to keep the\r\npeace in that country. It should not break the fragile peace\r\nthrough premature withdrawal. In this respect, the\r\ncommitment of the parties to the full and unconditional\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol is paramount.\r\nUNITA must therefore rise above the present impasse to\r\ncontribute to a final and lasting solution to the problem in\r\nAngola.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General’s efforts in the\r\nRepublic of Congo, and we are keeping our hopes alive for\r\na speedy resolution to that problem.\r\nWe welcome the new Government in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, and we call upon the international\r\ncommunity to render all necessary assistance to the\r\nGovernment and people of that country as they embark on\r\nthe road to national reconciliation and reconstruction.\r\nAfter seven years of tragic civil war in Liberia, my\r\ndelegation hails the peace which has finally dawned in that\r\ncountry. It is our hope that it will be a lasting peace. We\r\nsalute the people of Liberia for their good sense. Peace\r\ncannot sustain itself. It is therefore incumbent upon the\r\ninternational community to support the Government and\r\npeople of Liberia in their national reconciliation and\r\nreconstruction efforts to keep and consolidate peace and\r\nstability.\r\nOur hearts bleed when we consider the situation that\r\nhas unfolded in Sierra Leone, which has been responsible\r\nfor the regression of the reconstruction efforts in that\r\ncountry. The Government of the Republic of Namibia\r\ncondemned the coup d’état in Sierra Leone then and does\r\nso now. Namibia calls for the continued isolation of the\r\nmilitary regime in that country. We therefore welcome the\r\nappointment of the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the progress made during\r\nthe recent negotiations between the parties on Western\r\nSahara. We encourage them to continue to search for a\r\nfinal solution to that problem. We reiterate our call for\r\nthe early exercise by the Sahraoui people of their right to\r\nself-determination on the basis of a free, fair and\r\ntransparent referendum in Western Sahara, under the joint\r\nsupervision and control of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nWe reiterate the concern of the OAU about the\r\nconflict between Libya and the United States of America\r\nand the United Kingdom over the Lockerbie tragedy.\r\nWhile we regret the loss of life as a result of this tragedy,\r\nother innocent people continue to suffer as a result of the\r\nsubsequent sanctions imposed on Libya. We call for an\r\nurgent solution to this problem.\r\nThe Government of Namibia has reiterated on many\r\noccasions that the United States of America and the\r\nRepublic of Cuba should start to walk the distance of 90\r\nmiles towards reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. We\r\nhoped to see our aspirations come about. However, these\r\naspirations are being shattered by the new escalation in\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo against\r\nCuba through the application of the Helms-Burton Act.\r\nNotwithstanding this, we shall keep our hopes alive.\r\nThe construction of new settlements in the occupied\r\nterritories of Palestine is not conducive to peace in the\r\nMiddle East. We therefore call on the Government\r\nauthorities in Israel to desist from such acts. Peace in the\r\nMiddle East is in the interest of all parties concerned. We\r\ncall on the parties to resume negotiations.\r\nLet me conclude by stating the obvious: Peace is\r\ncheaper than war. Let us all unite our efforts to make the\r\nworld a haven of peace.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Domingo L. Siazon, Jr., Secretary of Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Philippines.\r\nMr. Siazon (Philippines): I am pleased to extend to\r\nyou, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, our most sincere\r\nfelicitations on your election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-second session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nWe also wish to congratulate His Excellency Tan Sri\r\nRazali Ismail, our colleague in the Assembly and our\r\npartner in the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), for his strong leadership as the President of the\r\nfifty-first session.\r\nWe take great pleasure in congratulating His\r\nExcellency Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We commit\r\nourselves to working with him for the improvement of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nNext year the Philippines will commemorate the\r\ncentenary of its proclamation of independence. Next year\r\nalso the Philippines is scheduled to conduct the most sacred\r\nexercise that democracy requires: electing national leaders\r\nthrough the popular will. As we mark our first century as\r\nthe first Republic to arise in Asia, and as we prepare to\r\nchoose those who will lead our country into the twenty-first\r\ncentury, we reflect on what we have achieved as a country\r\nand as a member of our community of nations. Today\r\npeace reigns in my country. Where there was strife, there\r\nis now national reconciliation. Where there was violent\r\nrebellion, there is now progress and hope.\r\nLast year, with the wisdom and guidance of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), in particular\r\nthe OIC’s Committee of Six, under the enlightened\r\nleadership of Indonesia and with the active support of\r\nLibya, the Philippine Government and the Moro National\r\nLiberation Front (MNLF) concluded a historic agreement\r\nthat brought peace to Mindanao after more than a quarter\r\ncentury of open secessionist rebellion. The leader of the\r\nMNLF is now the elected Governor of the Autonomous\r\nRegion of Muslim Mindanao and Chairman of the Southern\r\nPhilippines Council for Peace and Development. MNLF\r\nfighters are now being integrated into the armed forces of\r\nthe Philippines and the Philippine National Police.\r\nIndeed, there is much for us to celebrate as a nation\r\nand as a Republic. And this gives us even greater reason to\r\nreflect on the world and to ask ourselves fundamental\r\nquestions about its present state and its emerging future.\r\nOne such question that comes to mind is this: Is our\r\nworld a safer place? The end of the cold war has in a sense\r\nmade it so. But is the world safe enough when we continue\r\nto live under the threat posed by weapons of mass\r\ndestruction? Fortunately, the conclusion of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year and the\r\nongoing review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons give us some added security.\r\nWe must not stop here. Let us pursue negotiations\r\non the complete and total elimination of nuclear weapons\r\nby a certain time. This call is already supported by the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, which last year recognized\r\nthat all States have an obligation to pursue such\r\nnegotiations in good faith.\r\nOn 27 March 1997 the South-East Asia Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty entered into force. On that day,\r\nthe world of nuclear weapons became much smaller. We\r\nnow urge the nuclear-weapon States to support the Treaty\r\nby becoming parties to its Protocol. At this session we\r\nwill once again consider the initiative of consolidating\r\nexisting nuclear-weapon-free zones and of promoting\r\ncooperation among them with a view to the total\r\nelimination of such weapons.\r\nGlobal safety also demands control of the\r\nproliferation of conventional arms, particularly small arms\r\nand anti-personnel landmines, whether deployed or in\r\nnational stockpiles. In Oslo earlier this month the Ottawa\r\nprocess produced, after less than a year, the text of a\r\ntreaty banning anti-personnel landmines. We will sign this\r\ntreaty in December. We will also continue to support the\r\nnoble efforts of the Organization, of individual\r\nGovernments and of non-governmental organizations to\r\nclear minefields, to assist mine victims and to rehabilitate\r\nareas plagued by these infernal devices.\r\nAt the dawn of the post-cold-war era, we must\r\nacknowledge that the potential for the most serious\r\nconflict has shifted almost entirely from the global to the\r\nregional level. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Association\r\nof South-East Asian Nations, in response to this new\r\nreality, has led in creating the ASEAN Regional Forum,\r\na ministerial-level, multilateral forum for promoting\r\nregional-security dialogue and cooperation. Today in the\r\nAsia-Pacific region dialogue and cooperation are the pre-\r\neminent modes for securing peace.\r\nHowever, the disputes in the South China Sea\r\nremain a source of tension for our region. In 1992,\r\nASEAN issued, at Manila, a Declaration on the South\r\nChina Sea, which called for the settlement of disputes\r\nexclusively by peaceful means and for the exercise of\r\nself-restraint by all of the claimants. Other States have\r\nendorsed this Declaration. We are determined to advance\r\ntowards a settlement of these disputes in conformity with\r\ninternational law, including the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, while avoiding all acts\r\ninimical to stability and a sense of security in the region.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nLike many here, we were saddened by the recent\r\nevents in the political life of Cambodia. We in ASEAN\r\nhave initiated a dialogue to address the Cambodian issue,\r\neven as we look forward to the early admission of\r\nCambodia into the ASEAN family.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula, we hope that the current\r\ntalks will lead not only to large dividends of peace but also\r\nto greater cooperation towards economic growth and\r\nprogress for East Asia.\r\nIn South Africa, following the collapse of apartheid,\r\nwe are witnessing bold and sincere efforts towards deeper\r\nnational reconciliation. In other parts of Africa we see\r\nactive regional cooperation to promote peace and justice in\r\nthe aftermath of terrible conflicts. In Liberia, in particular,\r\nwe welcome the holding of free and fair elections with the\r\nsupport of the international community, led by the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\r\nIn the Middle East, peace is gravely imperilled by\r\nterrorism and political aggression. We call on all parties to\r\nrenounce all forms of violence and intimidation to preserve\r\nthe peace process that was begun only a few years ago to\r\nthe applause of the whole world.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, where much remains to be\r\ndone, we regret the deterioration of civil order and\r\ncondemn the violence directed against United Nations\r\npersonnel.\r\nIn Latin America, we welcome the honourable\r\ntermination of the civil war that had raged in Guatemala for\r\n36 years.\r\nIs the world a safer place for the world itself? The\r\nenvironment of our planet is under threat. Our response\r\nmust be to accelerate implementation of Agenda 21 in line\r\nwith the programme adopted last June. As a priority, we\r\nmust address the lack of financial resources, technology,\r\nknow-how and international cooperation that inhibits the\r\npromotion of worldwide sustainable development.\r\nThis December we will meet again to discuss a legally\r\nbinding instrument under the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change to control harmful\r\nemissions. We must agree now on emission reduction\r\ntargets, particularly for those who have emitted too much\r\nfor far too long.\r\nHow safe, we should also ask, is the world for the\r\nindividual human being? We can answer positively only\r\nwhen it becomes universally accepted that every human\r\nbeing has rights inherent in his or her person, and that all\r\nbasic rights — political, civil, social and economic —\r\nmust be in balanced harmony with one another. Thus, as\r\nlong as human rights are violated, as long as the right to\r\ndevelopment is vitiated, as long as the rights of women\r\nare not fully respected, as long as people are traded like\r\nchattels, as long as migrant workers, especially women\r\nmigrant workers, are abused and exploited, we cannot say\r\nthat the world is a safer place for the individual human\r\nperson.\r\nWe must protect our women. We must act on the\r\ndecisions we reached in Beijing, and we must do more to\r\ndeepen and broaden respect for the rights of women\r\nthrough the use of existing human rights agreements and\r\nmechanisms.\r\nWe must protect our children. We must effectively\r\nimplement the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and\r\nwe must append to this Convention a protocol that would\r\norganize global measures against child slavery,\r\nprostitution and pornography.\r\nIn addition, we call for universal adherence to the\r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights\r\nof All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.\r\nThe protection of human rights finds its most\r\neffective guarantees in democracy. Any threat to\r\ndemocracy also poses a direct and indirect threat to the\r\nrights of the human person. Today, in many countries,\r\nincluding my own, democracy is no longer endangered by\r\nthe extreme political left or right. Rather, the threats to\r\ndemocracy are more base and more insidious. Among\r\nthem are terrorism and the illicit traffic in narcotics.\r\nWith the objective of creating a regional consensus\r\non how best to address the issue of illicit drugs and other\r\ntransnational crimes, the Philippines will next year host\r\nthe regional ministerial meeting for Asia and the Pacific\r\non organized transnational crime and corruption. For this\r\nmeeting, we hope to take inspiration from and add to the\r\nconsensus achieved in the regional meetings held in\r\nAfrica and Latin America.\r\nOur efforts to make the world a safer place, and to\r\nsafeguard the rights of the individual, would lose much of\r\ntheir meaning if we were unable to answer the basic\r\nquestion: have the opportunities for growth and economic\r\nprogress improved?\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nThe rising tide of globalization has brought\r\nunprecedented opportunities for the developed and\r\ndeveloping worlds alike. The acceptance of market-oriented\r\ndevelopment and of free trade by an increasing number of\r\ndeveloping nations has expanded their participation in the\r\ngrowth and commerce of the global economy. Yet the\r\nbenefits of globalization remain unevenly distributed.\r\nDeveloping countries still suffer from the old problems of\r\nexternal debt and of protectionism in developed-country\r\nmarkets.\r\nThe recent currency turbulence in East Asia, the\r\nregion with the best long-term growth prospects in the\r\nworld, is a sobering reminder that globalization can cause\r\ninstability even where it has generated the greatest growth.\r\nThe existence of unbridled international speculation and of\r\nother market ills that hinder rather than help development\r\nis a powerful rationale for strengthening the United Nations\r\nrole in global development.\r\nOnly in the United Nations can we work to share,\r\namong rich and poor nations alike, the burden of structural\r\nadjustment imposed by globalization. Only within the\r\nUnited Nations system can we mobilize concerted global\r\naction to support progress in the poor regions of the globe,\r\nparticularly in Africa, whose needs call for special\r\nattention.\r\nThe Bretton Woods system and the multilateral\r\ndevelopment banks also need reform. Global flows of\r\nmultilateral development financing have to be increased,\r\nespecially since bilateral official development assistance is\r\ndeclining.\r\nCountries that wish to reduce their share in the\r\nfinancing of the United Nations should be willing to do the\r\nsame in international financial institutions, so that those that\r\nwant to increase their contributions to these institutions are\r\nable to do so without hindrance.\r\nAnother fundamental question we must ask is: are we\r\nready, as an Organization of States, as nations united, to\r\nface the challenges of tomorrow? The short answer is “No”.\r\nFor this reason, the Philippines strongly believes that\r\nwe must immediately embark upon the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. We need to enhance the capacity of the\r\nworld body to meet the exigencies of modern times. A\r\nfundamental objective of reform should be to restore\r\ndevelopment to the centre of the United Nations agenda.\r\nThe Philippines, therefore, endorses the\r\nrecommendations of the Open-ended High Level Working\r\nGroup on the Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nSystem. If properly implemented, they could render the\r\nGeneral Assembly more effective in fulfilling its Charter\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nOur Secretary-General has given us a report on his\r\nown reform proposals. These deserve the serious\r\nconsideration of the General Assembly. We appreciate the\r\nemphasis placed by the Secretary-General on\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe also need to accelerate discussions on the reform\r\nof the Security Council. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nprogress that has been made in clarifying and identifying\r\nthe elements that must be negotiated if we are to move\r\ntowards any expansion of the membership of the Council.\r\nThe Philippines favours the enlargement of the\r\nmembership of the Council in order to enhance its\r\nefficiency and effectiveness. Security Council membership\r\nshould be more representative of the world’s developing\r\nregions and more reflective of modern global realities.\r\nNew permanent members should enjoy the same rights as\r\ncurrent permanent members. The use of the veto should\r\nbe limited to actions under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nTalking of reform is good. But our talk will lead\r\nnowhere if our Organization does not have the resources\r\nrequired to improve and revitalize itself. We survived the\r\nbalance of terror of the cold war. Let us now work on\r\nbalancing our cheque-books in the post-cold-war era.\r\nThere is much irony in this. The end of the cold war\r\nshould also have meant an end to the astronomical\r\nfinances spent on deterrence. It might have been\r\nreasonable to expect that a fraction of those finances\r\ncould now be shared to help the United Nations promote\r\nworld peace, progress and prosperity.\r\nYet this is obviously not the case. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposed revolving credit fund of $1 billion, to\r\nbe financed though voluntary contributions or other\r\nmeans — if it materializes — may provide temporary\r\nrelief. However, there is a real danger that this proposal\r\nwill encourage those in arrears to delay further their\r\npayments to the Organization.\r\nThe Philippines is in favour of reform. But\r\nreforming the United Nations should not be seen as an\r\nopportunity to hold our Organization to ransom. We are\r\nall in favour of reforming and strengthening the United\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nNations. But setting benchmarks of reform should not be a\r\nprecondition for a Member State to pay its assessed\r\ncontributions.\r\nIn the 100 years since my country declared its\r\nindependence, war and occupation, dictatorship and partisan\r\npolitics have at one time or another endangered our\r\ndemocracy. And in those eventful 100 years, we have\r\ncultivated certain insights that might prove relevant to us\r\nhere today. We have learned, as a country, that we must\r\ncherish the ideals of democracy in all aspects of our\r\nnational life, including in our dealings with other nations.\r\nAfter my people emerged victorious in our last major\r\nbattle with forces opposed to democracy over a decade ago,\r\nwe resolved to share our experience with the rest of the\r\nworld. Thus, we organized in Manila the first meeting of\r\nthe International Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies (ICNRD) in 1988. From the 13 nations that\r\nfirst met in Manila, ICNRD has grown to 76 countries\r\ntoday. I congratulate Romania for its successful hosting of\r\nICNRD’s third meeting earlier this month.\r\nGiven the diversity of the membership of our\r\nOrganization, it is not surprising that we may have some\r\ndifferences even on such fundamental issues as international\r\npeace, global development and the protection of the\r\nindividual. However, I submit that, if our Organization is to\r\nfunction properly and if Member States are to relate to each\r\nother in an effective manner, then we must all follow\r\ncertain basic principles and ideals. These principles and\r\nideals are those that democracy has taught us. Let us work\r\ntogether with all the creative energy at our command and\r\nwith the ideals of democracy as our guiding light.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Thailand, His Excellency Mr.\r\nPrachuab Chaiyasan.\r\nMr. Chaiyasan (Thailand): It is with great pleasure\r\nthat my delegation extends to you, Sir, its sincere\r\ncongratulations on your unanimous election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its current session.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its deepest appreciation to your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for his exceptional\r\nleadership and creative energies during the past year. I also\r\nwish to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the new dynamism which he has brought to the\r\nOrganization since he took office last January.\r\nThis fifty-second session of the General Assembly\r\ntakes place against the backdrop of transition and\r\ntransformation in the world. The euphoria that came in\r\nthe wake of the end of the cold war has given way to a\r\nsense of realism about the new, and no less formidable,\r\nchallenges that confront us all in this era of globalization.\r\nThe changes, led by technology and the globalization of\r\nbusiness and information, seem endless and increasingly\r\ncomplex. Governments, meanwhile, face the daunting task\r\nof constantly trying to discern and adjust to the new order\r\nof international relations.\r\nFor all the changes, some legacies of the cold war\r\nare still very much with us. Nothing brings home this\r\nreality more than the unfortunate events unfolding in\r\nCambodia. While the situation in Cambodia that confronts\r\nus today is very different from the one we faced before\r\nthe signing of the Paris Peace Accord, finding a solution\r\nis no less difficult.\r\nHow can we deal with a conflict which is basically\r\ninternal in character, particularly when our ability to\r\ninfluence events has become limited and we are overcome\r\nwith the fatigue born of déjà vu? Clearly, we cannot turn\r\nour backs on Cambodia. But the reality is that we in\r\nThailand and in the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN), as well as the entire international\r\ncommunity, can only be supportive to the extent that the\r\nCambodians themselves are willing to give peace a\r\nchance.\r\nMrs. Eshmambetova (Kyrgyzstan), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe situation in Cambodia reflects a peculiar aspect\r\nof this brave new age we are entering. Even as the world\r\nis being transformed by sweeping global trends, some\r\nproblems are so deep-rooted that they resist even the best\r\nefforts of the international community. The United\r\nNations, no stranger itself to intractable conflicts, will\r\ncontinue to be one of our best hopes for resolving such\r\nsituations.\r\nWhile tending to such traditional challenges, the\r\nUnited Nations must also address the many complex new\r\nchallenges brought on by the process of globalization.\r\nIndeed, globalization has come to mean different things\r\nto different people. To many, it holds out the promise of\r\nan unprecedented era of progress and prosperity. To its\r\nproponents, globalization has unleashed the forces of\r\ncreativity and productivity in the world economy.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nGlobalization has been heralded for having spread the ideas\r\nand values of democracy and freedom worldwide.\r\nOn the other hand, there are those who contend that\r\nglobalization has become an all-embracing pretext for the\r\nimposition of certain sets of ideas and values. They see\r\nglobalization as leading to a monopoly of economic power\r\nin the hands of a ruthless few whose sole allegiance is to\r\nthe workings of market forces, while the vast majority of\r\nhumanity is increasingly marginalized.\r\nThe reality most likely lies somewhere between these\r\ntwo extreme views. The fact of the matter is that we must\r\nall develop the capacity to cope with the effects of\r\nglobalization, both positive and negative. Even the more\r\nsuccessful developing countries have not escaped the\r\ntremendous turmoil that integration into the global market\r\ncan bring on, as evidenced by the currency crisis that\r\nThailand and many other countries in South-East Asia are\r\ngoing through.\r\nThailand’s recent experience suggests that to thrive\r\nunder economic globalization, developing countries have to\r\nfully understand how market forces work and to adapt\r\nthemselves accordingly. Thailand has learned that financial\r\nliberalization requires a high degree of discipline from both\r\nthe public and private sectors. Also crucial is the need to be\r\nvigilant in improving prudential regulations. Moreover, a\r\nmore comprehensive macroeconomic analysis is needed in\r\norder to improve the monitoring of current economic\r\nconditions.\r\nBut Thailand’s basic strengths remain. Our economic\r\nfundamentals are still underscored by a remarkably high\r\nsavings rate, relatively low inflation and a strong tradition\r\nof market-oriented policy framework. We are firm in our\r\ncommitment to free and open markets. We are also active\r\nin promoting regional cooperation and economic\r\nliberalization through such frameworks as the Association\r\nof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area,\r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and various\r\nsubregional development schemes.\r\nMoreover, we are firm in our determination to achieve\r\ngood governance and greater democracy. This past\r\nSaturday, the Thai Parliament approved the new draft\r\nConstitution, which emphasizes transparency, accountability\r\nand the role of public participation.\r\nOur political reform goes hand in hand with our\r\neconomic reform. We realize that we can no longer put off\r\neconomic restructuring if we are to get back on track\r\nquickly. We are therefore seriously implementing the\r\nconditions of the International Monetary Fund rescue\r\npackage. We are also working with the World Bank and\r\nthe Asian Development Bank to restructure our financial\r\nsystem, enhance our export competitiveness and return the\r\neconomy to its long-term sustainable growth through\r\nnecessary reforms of the civil service, privatization,\r\nindustrial restructuring and the upgrading of the quality of\r\nour workforce, our technology and our infrastructure.\r\nI prefer to think of this crisis as a blessing in\r\ndisguise. While we have done many things right in the\r\npast — including progressive industrialization and\r\nliberalization of international trade and investment —\r\nwith the benefit of hindsight, the macroeconomic\r\ncapability to cope with an increasingly open capital\r\nmarket was inadequate. Globalization of business and\r\nfinance compels us to become more competitive through\r\ngreater openness and transparency. Our economy is too\r\ndeeply integrated into the international economic system\r\nto do anything less. We cannot fight the market; what we\r\nmust do is ensure that the market works efficiently and\r\nequitably.\r\nAt the same time, Thailand’s experience also shows\r\nthat the United Nations has an important role to play in\r\ncoordinating macroeconomic policy at the global level.\r\nCloser cooperation and coordination is needed between\r\nthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nthe World Trade Organization and major industrial\r\ncountries to provide integrated support for the\r\nenhancement of capacity-building in those countries\r\nwhose economies are still weak. Globalization of course\r\nhas its winners and losers. The rules of the game should\r\ntherefore take into account both the weaknesses and\r\nstrengths of all countries concerned.\r\nAs a universal and multi-purpose Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations is the only institution in the world capable\r\nof forging a global partnership among States, big and\r\nsmall, rich and poor, powerful and weak. No single State\r\nor region can go it alone. This is why Thailand is\r\ncommitted to supporting the United Nations. This is why\r\nThailand welcomes the reform-action initiatives and\r\nproposals recently put forward by the Secretary-General.\r\nI hope that these measures will enable the United Nations\r\nto carry out its responsibilities with increased efficiency\r\nand effectiveness. I wish the Secretary-General well on\r\nthe further implementation of these proposals.\r\nThailand attaches great importance to the\r\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations in\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\npromoting international cooperation for economic and social\r\ndevelopment. We are pleased that in his reform proposals\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan argued that the promotion of\r\nsustainable development should be the central priority of\r\nUnited Nations activities. While the reform plan proposed\r\nby the Secretary-General requires more thorough\r\nconsideration, Thailand can support his proposal of\r\ndesignating the United Nations Development Group —\r\ncomprising the United Nations Development Programme,\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund — to supersede the sectoral group of\r\ndevelopment operations. We hope that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group will facilitate consolidation and\r\ncooperation among United Nations agencies without\r\ncompromising their identities, so that they can respond\r\nmore effectively to the needs of developing countries.\r\nThailand also welcomes the creation of a development\r\ndividend by shifting resources from administration to\r\ndevelopment activities. According to the reform plan, the\r\nadministrative costs will be reduced by one third, the\r\nworkforce will be reduced by 1,000 posts and the\r\npaperwork will be cut by 30 per cent. However, downsizing\r\nshould not be an end in itself. The central element of the\r\nreform should concentrate on how to manage funds and\r\nimplement programmes so as to achieve equitable\r\ndevelopment, which is our common goal.\r\nAnother important point in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreform plan is the proposal to mobilize more resources for\r\nUnited Nations operational activities. Thailand sees the\r\nUnited Nations as the main forum for the creation of an\r\nequal and workable partnership between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries — a partnership that should be\r\nresponsive to the needs and aspirations of the developing\r\nworld. The steady decline in voluntary contributions to core\r\nresources has inhibited the capacity of United Nations funds\r\nand programmes to play the roles assigned to them. In this\r\nregard, we support the Secretary-General’s proposal on\r\ninnovative means of mobilizing new financial resources for\r\ndevelopment. The private sector is potentially an important\r\nsource of financial support, as demonstrated by the\r\nproposed donation of $l billion by Mr. Ted Turner.\r\nHowever, the funds from the private sector should be\r\nadditional to, and must not replace, official development\r\nassistance.\r\nThe restructuring of the Security Council is also a vital\r\npart of United Nations reform. Despite the end of the cold\r\nwar, the anachronistic yet so powerful veto power still\r\nexists in this supposedly more democratized institution. It\r\nis heartening, however, to note that the issue has been\r\nextensively debated. Thailand and its ASEAN partners, as\r\nwell as the Non-Aligned Movement, believe that this veto\r\npower should be curtailed with a view to its eventual\r\nelimination. The Security Council itself should be\r\nexpanded, taking into account the increase in United\r\nNations membership to enhance its democratic and\r\nrepresentative nature, while at the same time paying due\r\nregard to its efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nBut without the firm commitment of Member States,\r\nall these reform efforts would come to nothing. Member\r\nStates have the obligation under the Charter to bear the\r\nexpenses of the Organization by paying their assessed\r\ncontributions in full on time and without conditions.\r\nThailand has always taken its financial obligation\r\nseriously and has made every effort to fulfil it. For 1997\r\nThailand is among the 28 countries which paid their\r\ncontributions to the regular budget in full and on time.\r\nThailand believes that one of the main tasks of the\r\nUnited Nations is to set standards in international law,\r\nand in recent years there has been an encouraging trend\r\ntowards efforts to advance the cause of international law\r\nthrough the creation of legal norms and instruments. What\r\nthese norms and instruments symbolize is the desire of\r\npeoples to live in a more orderly world. Thailand will\r\ncontinue to support and participate actively in efforts to\r\nestablish an international criminal court, as well as in the\r\nelaboration of new legal instruments to combat terrorism.\r\nIn December of this year, Thailand hopes to be one of the\r\nsignatories of the Ottawa treaty banning all anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. We believe that there is no greater crime than\r\nmaiming or killing innocent civilians. It is high time that\r\nwe put an end to this. At the same time, greater efforts\r\nand resources should be devoted to removing and\r\ndestroying these landmines.\r\nAs a signatory of the South-East Asia Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty, which was concluded in\r\nBangkok during the ASEAN summit in 1995, Thailand\r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nthe Governments of Central Asia for their initiative to\r\nestablish a Central Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone. Their\r\ncommendable effort adds to the strong evidence that the\r\npeoples of the world are no longer tolerant of nuclear\r\nweapons. At present, more than 100 United Nations\r\nMember States are signatories of nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone treaties in their respective regions, treaties which\r\nnow cover the greater part of the world, including Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, the South Pacific, Africa,\r\nSouth-East Asia and, soon, Central Asia. What we are\r\nwitnessing here is a new partnership, a partnership among\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nthe peoples of the world who dread nuclear arsenals and\r\nwish to eliminate these hazardous weapons of mass\r\ndestruction from the face of the earth.\r\nThe international environment in which we live is\r\nevolving rapidly. During the past year, there have been\r\nmany encouraging developments. But we also find\r\nourselves confronted with new and increasingly complex\r\nchallenges. In order to overcome these challenges, the\r\nUnited Nations as an Organization needs vision and\r\ninventiveness. But, more importantly, its Members need to\r\nspeak with one voice on issues which confront mankind. If\r\nwe are to succeed in doing this, a global partnership needs\r\nto be forged, be it in the area of politics, economic and\r\nsocial development, environmental protection or\r\nhumanitarian assistance. Sooner rather than later, we should\r\nall realize that, in this globalized world, our destinies are\r\nlinked together much more closely than we like to believe.\r\nThe time to forge this partnership is now. The place to\r\nbegin the process is here, at the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Lebanon, His Excellency Mr. Fares\r\nBouez.\r\nMr. Bouez (Lebanon) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me to extend our thanks to the outgoing President,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, and to congratulate him on the\r\nway in which he fulfilled his mandate. I would also like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election and\r\nwish him complete success in his efforts to strengthen and\r\nincrease the effectiveness of the United Nations in these\r\nhistoric times, which more than ever demand our\r\napplication, perseverance, determination and good faith.\r\nMore than half a century has elapsed since the United\r\nNations was founded. When the United Nations was born,\r\nmankind wanted it to lead to the creation of a world of\r\njustice, law and peace. The United Nations was supposed\r\nto be able to defend human rights when they were violated\r\nand promote justice. By means of the United Nations,\r\nmankind aspired to put an end to an era of war and usher\r\nin an era of peace and tolerance, of respect for national\r\nsovereignty and people’s freedom and of independence of\r\nStates; an era in which people would be free to fulfil their\r\ndreams and aspirations and to maintain their identity. Never\r\nin the course of human history have we needed the United\r\nNations more than we need it today, in this era of\r\ncommunications and contacts, when frontiers are\r\ndisappearing under the force of the technological revolution.\r\nThis is an era of demographic explosion and deadly,\r\ndestructive weapons; an era when the environment is no\r\nlonger capable of meeting mankind’s demands.\r\nToday we are truly in need of a basic means of\r\ncontaining conflicts and resolving disputes. This is why\r\nwe must increase the effectiveness of the United Nations\r\nmechanism and renew confidence in its justice, credibility\r\nand effectiveness, the freedom of its decision-making\r\nprocesses from hegemony, and the absence of imbalances\r\nin its measured ways and in the enforcement of its\r\nresolutions so that no one remains above international\r\nlaw. These steps are essential if we want to prevent the\r\ncollapse of the United Nations, and if we want it to retain\r\nthe moral authority necessary to resolve disputes and\r\nremain an alternative to hot and deadly confrontations.\r\nTherefore, Lebanon enthusiastically supports the\r\nreform of United Nations institutions, particularly the\r\nSecurity Council. We call for enhancing the numerical\r\nand geographical balance of the Council so as to reflect\r\nchanged realities. The Council must also be reformed to\r\ndissipate the misgivings some have about the way it\r\nperforms its role.\r\nLebanon subscribes to the principle of rotation of the\r\npermanent seats in the Security Council. We reiterate our\r\nsupport for the position of the Arab Group, as expressed\r\nin the paper it presented on this subject.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s proposals for\r\nthe reform of the United Nations. We have given them\r\nour full attention and are carefully studying them. We\r\nbelieve it is necessary to enhance the role of the General\r\nAssembly and to make the issue of development a high\r\npriority for the Organization, while attaching great\r\nimportance to the work of regional economic and social\r\ncommissions.\r\nUnder the rubric of reducing costs and the budget,\r\nmany United Nations agencies, in particular the United\r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\r\nin the Near East (UNRWA), have lost much of their\r\nability to adequately provide social, health and education\r\nservices to refugees in their host countries. This increases\r\nthe burden on host countries, Lebanon among them. It is\r\ndifficult for us to shoulder these responsibilities under\r\nthese conditions. The responsibility of the international\r\ncommunity in redressing the injustice inflicted on the\r\nPalestinian refugees must be made apparent. This bitter\r\nreality, which cannot be free of hidden intentions, aims at\r\ntimes at attempting to pressure these countries and force\r\nthem to assimilate the refugee population they are hosting.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nThis would be a step towards liquidating the refugees’ case\r\nfor return. It is also a means of pressuring the host\r\ncountries into accepting unacceptable political terms.\r\nThe international community, represented by the\r\nUnited Nations and the donor countries, is duty-bound to\r\ncontinue to render assistance to the Palestinian refugees\r\nawaiting a political resolution of their status in accordance\r\nwith the right to return, as decided upon by the United\r\nNations and, in particular, the principle of reuniting\r\nfamilies. This is one of the pillars of the peace process, and\r\nthus it is essential that the international community\r\npersevere until a solution is attained.\r\nWe had hoped that this session would be an occasion\r\nfor us to express our gratitude for the restoration of peace\r\nin Lebanon and the Middle East. This would have been an\r\nattestation to the success of the Madrid peace process,\r\nwhich was launched six years ago to which should be\r\nadded one year of preparation. This international peace\r\ninitiative began auspiciously. We believed in both its letter\r\nand its spirit because the initiative was international, the\r\nsponsorship was effective and the contents were based upon\r\nan equitable, just and permanent peace. We were very\r\nhopeful, because we thought that peace would be realized\r\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\r\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978), on the basis of the principle of\r\nland for peace and on the basis of finding a consensual\r\nsolution to the question of Jerusalem. The initiative was\r\nalso supposed to put an end to Israel’s building and\r\nexpansion of settlements in the occupied territories and lead\r\nto the recognition of the political rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople. It was supposed to be followed by a discussion of\r\nregional arrangements to settle security, social and\r\neconomic questions, in particular the question of the\r\nPalestinian refugees, thereby paving the way for the\r\neconomic development of the region.\r\nWe entered into the peace process convinced that the\r\nbasic elements had been accepted at Madrid and that they\r\nhad become commitments of the participating States. We\r\nthought that all that remained for the delegations was to\r\nbegin negotiations on implementation. However, the advent\r\nof the present Israeli Government and its head totally\r\ndashed our hopes, given the practices of this new\r\nGovernment. The principle of land for peace was thrown\r\nout, to be replaced by a new formula. The Israeli\r\nGovernment reneged on the need for implementation of\r\ninternational decisions, and thus demanded their\r\nreinterpretation. That Government did not want to find a\r\nsolution to the question of Jerusalem, so it went ahead and\r\nannexed it. The Israeli Government reneged on its\r\ncommitments with regard to the occupied Syrian Golan,\r\nso it stressed its annexation. The Israeli Government\r\ndemolished the principle of halting settlement activities\r\nand vastly expanded their efforts at settlement.\r\nThe negotiated commitments of the previous\r\nGovernment were abandoned, as if there were no\r\ncontinuity from one Government to the next. Instead of\r\nmaking progress towards peace — the only worthwhile\r\nobjective — the Government devoted itself to destroying\r\nwhat had been done, even if the steps previously taken\r\nwere limited.\r\nInstead of being able to work towards a genuine\r\npeace, we have had to endure propaganda manoeuvres\r\naimed at numbing and misleading public opinion, along\r\nwith meetings that were designed just to give the\r\nimpression that a dialogue was continuing. Instead of\r\ntrying to find a solution to the basic conflict, the emphasis\r\nshifted to the normalization of relations through economic\r\nconferences — as a precondition, even before solving the\r\nlegal and political problem — instead of having\r\nnormalization occur naturally as a crowning of the basic\r\nsolution.\r\nFaced with heightened internal crisis, the Israeli\r\nGovernment resorted to stirring up tension along its\r\nborders and in areas under occupation, to divert attention\r\naway from the peace it had scuttled. Thus, the principle\r\nof provocation and confrontation was re-established in\r\norder to create unity internally.\r\nIsrael continued to carry out its acts of aggression\r\nagainst southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa, once\r\nwith the goal of mobilizing Israeli public opinion against\r\npeace, and another time for the purpose of emptying\r\ninternational initiatives of their political content.\r\nThe attacks continued, through artillery shelling, air\r\nraids, operations inside our territories — against villages\r\nand cities — against children, women, the elderly and\r\nhomes. Destruction and demolition continued, as did the\r\ndetention of Lebanese citizens in Israeli military camps —\r\nall of this without the United Nations international\r\ninstitutions being allowed to visit them. They were not\r\npermitted the enjoyment of elementary human rights: the\r\nright to counsel and the right to a fair trial. Some of them\r\nwere returned to us as corpses, while others were tortured\r\nor maimed — and this in the era of respect for the rights\r\nof environment, of plants, and of animals.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nNonetheless, the more the occupation endured, the\r\nmore Israel became increasingly bogged down in the\r\nquagmire of the south which became an inferno to it. The\r\noccupier has become a prisoner, and the aggressor a\r\nhostage in the face of a valiant people’s steadfastness and\r\nthe resistance of its sons and daughters. Thus Israel\r\nsustained huge losses which is prompting it to rethink the\r\nviability and usefulness of its continued occupation of\r\nsouthern Lebanon.\r\nAgainst this reality, we heard, through misleading\r\nmedia reports, of an Israeli readiness to withdraw.\r\nWe have to bring the truth forth. Lebanon’s firm\r\nstance has always been for a complete Israeli withdrawal to\r\ninternationally recognized borders so as to enable the\r\nLebanese State to exercise its sovereignty over its territories\r\nthrough its own forces. But Israel does not wish to\r\nwithdraw; it is still camouflaging its unwillingness to\r\nwithdraw completely by relocating or redeploying its forces.\r\nIt continues to cast a smoke screen by asking to maintain\r\ninspection and control posts, by imposing conditions that\r\nlimit the State’s authority and by giving the upper hand to\r\nthe militias that it created. Furthermore, Israel is attempting\r\nto impose control over the Lebanese Army, which could be\r\ndeployed, as well as other conditions that challenge any\r\npresumed Lebanese sovereignty when withdrawal takes\r\nplace.\r\nI should like to pay tribute to our fallen heroes,\r\nmembers of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\r\n(UNIFIL) — most recently four Italian soldiers and an Irish\r\nsergeant. Their blood was spilled in defence of southern\r\nLebanon, mixing with that of Lebanese citizens. I should\r\nalso like to pay tribute to the Force itself, whose\r\ncommanders and troops are discharging a difficult task\r\nunder the most difficult and most trying circumstances.\r\nNo sooner had the people of the region begun to adapt\r\nto the anticipated climate of peace than they were thrust\r\nback into an era of confrontation, violence and inevitable\r\ndefiance and resistance. Though development plans for the\r\nMiddle East region were being formulated, and the world\r\nmanifested interest in its peaceful future, caution and\r\npessimism began once again to prevail, and hopes were\r\ndashed. No sooner had the Government of Israel drawn\r\nstrength from the veto power used against Security Council\r\nresolutions on its settlement policies, it has continued to\r\nchallenge Council resolutions, thereby undermining\r\nwhatever is left of the peace process.\r\nThe international community, which stands to be\r\naffected by the situation in the region, either directly or\r\nindirectly, must hold the defiant accountable. The\r\ninternational community has not only the right but also\r\nthe duty to take action through the Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations. On many occasions, the United Nations\r\nhas delegated this question to others, hoping that a\r\nsolution could be found. It has consistently refrained from\r\nenforcing its resolutions, in contrast to its recent\r\nbehaviour vis-à-vis many other States.\r\nThe time has come for the United Nations to reclaim\r\nits role. The time has come to return to the basics of\r\npeace as agreed in Madrid, to the principle of land for\r\npeace, to the need to implement Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and\r\nto resume negotiations on all tracks from the point where\r\nthey stopped. The time has come for Israel immediately\r\nto cease all settlement activities; to resolve the status of\r\nthe city of Jerusalem; to withdraw from the Palestinian\r\nterritory and recognize the political rights of the\r\nPalestinian people; to withdraw from the Syrian Golan to\r\nthe line of 4 June 1967; to fully withdraw from southern\r\nLebanon and its western Bekaa to the internationally\r\nrecognized boundaries in order to enable the Lebanese\r\nState to exercise its authority, in accordance with Security\r\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978).\r\nOpting for a peace that ignores these fundamentals\r\nis a choice that is doomed to failure, a choice that could\r\nignite the entire region. An isolationist policy that\r\nseparates the various tracks would run counter to the\r\nprinciple of a comprehensive peace and will never\r\nachieve it. This is because the conflict is fundamentally\r\na comprehensive one. It has never been a conflict\r\nbetween one single Arab State and Israel, but has always\r\nbeen between the Arabs and Israel. As long as a single\r\ntrack is excluded from the solution, peace will remain\r\nimpossible. The tracks are all intertwined, which shows\r\nhow indivisible and interconnected the cause is. Nobody\r\nshould think that one track can survive, even for one\r\nhour, while other tracks remain excluded.\r\nBecause Lebanon is at the heart of the conflict, it\r\nhas suffered a great deal. Today, however, it is\r\nconfounding all forecasts and expectations that presaged\r\nits demise by proving to the world once again, as it has\r\ndone throughout its long and time-honoured history, that\r\nit is too strong to wither away, and that a right that is\r\nclaimed by its people will never disappear.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nWhen southern Lebanon and western Bekaa are\r\nliberated, when Lebanese sovereignty extends to all its\r\nterritory, when the United Nations credibility is confirmed\r\nby the authority of its resolutions, when Israeli jails are\r\nemptied of their innocent detainees and resistance fighters,\r\nwhen an end is put to bloodshed which soaks our land, then\r\nand only then will the wound be healed. The tears will then\r\nstop and confidence will be restored to all in a genuine,\r\njust, permanent and comprehensive peace, a peace that can\r\nrestore to the land of civilizations, religions and cultures the\r\nplace it deserves now and in future, as it has always been\r\nthroughout its long history.\r\nThe choice of peace will not always be available to us.\r\nThe peace that the Assembly supported is in the throes of\r\ndeath today. If restoring peace seems difficult, its demise\r\nwould close the door to any attempt to rekindle the process\r\nin the foreseeable future, thus putting world peace in\r\njeopardy and sparking an uncontrollable conflagration,\r\nwhich will be difficult to contain.\r\nMay God guide the steps of those who are working for\r\na peace that is just and not unfair, equitable and not biased,\r\nconsensual and not imposed, a peace that honours the\r\nmemory of those martyred, that does justice to those who\r\nstruggle, and that would put an end to darkness in the land\r\nof the prophets and the messengers of God.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Kuwait, Mr. Mohammad Abulhasan.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me pleasure to convey to the President the\r\ngreetings of His Excellency Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-\r\nJaber Al-Sabah, Acting Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the State of Kuwait, who profoundly\r\nregrets being unable to participate personally in the debate\r\nat this session due to some pressing matters. He has\r\nrequested me to deliver the following statement by Kuwait\r\non his behalf:\r\n“On behalf of the State of Kuwait, it gives me\r\npleasure to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on\r\nhis election as President of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. We are confident\r\nthat he will be able to lead our deliberations\r\nefficiently towards a successful conclusion. The\r\nextensive experience he has gained from service at\r\nthis important international institution together with\r\nthe high posts he has assumed will no doubt prove\r\nvaluable. Let me also underline the good relations\r\nexisting between our two countries, based on mutual\r\nunderstanding and common interest.\r\n“I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute\r\nto his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, who\r\ndemonstrated an impressive sense of purpose,\r\ndedication and deep perception. Under his\r\nstewardship, the Assembly reasserted its genuine\r\nimportance and relevance in international relations.\r\n“I wish to pay tribute to our new Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who took\r\nthe helm of the Organization at the beginning of the\r\nyear. Apart from being a long-time career insider at\r\nthe United Nations, Mr. Annan to us now stands as\r\na good example of the executive manager enjoying\r\nwisdom and prudence, together with integrity and\r\ncommitment, that make him a living embodiment of\r\ndedication to the ideals and mission of the United\r\nNations.\r\n“In the same vein, I wish to set on record our\r\nrecognition of the significant contribution of\r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in leading the Organization with efficiency\r\nand confidence. Kuwait will always recognize his\r\ncontributions with a deep sense of appreciation.\r\n“Two years ago, the United Nations celebrated\r\nits fiftieth anniversary. The mood then was\r\noptimistic about the role and capability of the\r\nOrganization to cope with the lingering issues that\r\nremained without a solution over the first half\r\ncentury. This was due to the nature of these\r\nproblems, which was aggravated by the major-Power\r\npolarization during the cold war. The sense of\r\noptimism emanated from our deep conviction that\r\nthe global understanding that swept the world would\r\neventually generate the firm will to address the\r\noutstanding problems that jeopardize international\r\npeace and security. Also, the widespread public\r\nawareness of the relevance of the United Nations\r\nwould also help the Organization in resolving\r\npending matters. Furthermore, the impressive track\r\nrecord of the United Nations has earned it collective\r\ncredibility regarding the vitality and flexibility of the\r\nmachinery at its disposal.\r\n“Kuwait has examined with great interest the\r\nmeasures and recommendations contained in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nentitled Renewing the United Nations: A Programme\r\nfor Reform\u0027, which was submitted to the General\r\nAssembly in mid-July last. In this connection, we\r\nwould like to register Kuwait’s support for this\r\nprogramme and its appreciation of the efforts made by\r\nMr. Kofi Annan and his assistants to produce this\r\nimpressive achievement. The report is analytical in its\r\napproach and pragmatic in its outlook, focusing on\r\nperformance efficiency without partiality. It also\r\nfocused on improving the financial situation of the\r\nOrganization through the institution of better internal\r\ncontrol mechanisms and practical suggestions. The\r\nultimate goal of all these measures is to enhance the\r\nperformance of the United Nations, which would be\r\nmore innovative in its operational modalities and more\r\nfocused on its global concerns.\r\n“We have noted, with appreciation, the reports\r\nsubmitted by a wide array of working groups on\r\nrestructuring the organs of the United Nations and\r\nimproving their efficiency in order to adapt the entire\r\nsystem to the new era following the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations and the post-\r\nconfrontation environment. The United Nations seems\r\npoised to embark on addressing in a more\r\ncomprehensive manner humanitarian, cultural,\r\ndemographic and environmental issues which were not\r\nprominent on its list of priorities previously.\r\n“Moreover, as we recognize the realities of\r\ncontemporary life, we understand that the world order\r\ncontinues to be quite fluid, and it is indeed difficult to\r\npredict its future shape. The current stage is not a\r\nunipolar power era, as some might imagine. It is a\r\nmultipolar arena, where military might is no longer the\r\nfinal arbiter in the definition of polarity. In fact, there\r\nexists immense technological superiority, which may\r\nenable some States to make an outstanding\r\ncontribution to the shaping of global strategies. There\r\nis also the economic power that has brought together\r\nthe major industrial nations in a collectivity which has\r\na significant influence on the implementation of world\r\nstrategies. This is not to mention the giant economic\r\ngroupings which exist in the world of today.\r\n“Accordingly, the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council,\r\nand other Matters Related to the Security Council,\r\nwhich has been examining the question of reform and\r\nexpansion of Security Council membership for the\r\npast four years, should take these new facts of life\r\ninto consideration. Once agreed upon, the new\r\nmembership composition should reflect a collective\r\nand emphatic will to address adequately the issues at\r\nhand. Permanent members of the Council should be\r\npolitically capable and should be financial and troop\r\ncontributors. They should also be adept at crisis\r\nmanagement, and able to act decisively, without\r\nhesitation, when the situation warrants such action.\r\n“In the final analysis, membership of the\r\nSecurity Council is not a privilege as much as it is\r\na responsibility. It should not be a means for\r\nvisibility, but a product of conviction. Our view is\r\nthat the Security Council in its forthcoming\r\ncomposition should be a mirror reflecting a world\r\nshifting towards universalization and transparency in\r\norder to instil a better sense of security in all\r\nmembers of the world community, both North and\r\nSouth, East and West. Membership should not be\r\ndivided between diverse security concepts, some\r\nfavouring the North, while others are appropriate for\r\nthe South.\r\n“In this context, Kuwait affirms its full\r\ncommitment to the common Arab position and to the\r\nstand of the Non-Aligned Movement, both of which\r\nwere elaborated time and again in several meetings\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group.\r\n“Undoubtedly, agreement on the concept of\r\nunconventional and common security requires in the\r\nfirst instance recognition of some crucial facts. The\r\nfirst element is the conviction that the security of\r\nhumankind is universal and, in the final analysis,\r\nindivisible. The interests of members of the world\r\ncommunity have become more and more\r\ninterdependent, while civilizations and cultures are\r\ndrawing closer. The daily concerns of individuals are\r\nuniversal in nature, requiring complex solutions, and\r\nare multidimensional in their negative impacts. The\r\nsecond element is the emphasis on the concept of\r\neconomic and social development as a crucial factor\r\nin ensuring conventional security and collective\r\nhandling of development requirements. This also\r\ncalls for the involvement of international institutions\r\nin contributions to the improvement of living\r\nconditions in the poor nations that face severe\r\nimpediments in their development efforts.\r\n“The third element is a firm belief in and\r\ncommitment to the dignity of the human person as\r\nbeing the essence of human relations both within a\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\ngiven society and among nations. In effect, this means\r\nupholding the dignity of the human person in the face\r\nof bloody regimes which flagrantly violate the\r\nprinciples of human rights and destroy their own\r\nnations to arrogate power to themselves. This brings\r\nus to the necessity of safeguarding the principles set\r\nforth in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights and in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\n“Fourthly, all members of the world community\r\nshould adopt peaceful policies which renounce\r\nviolence, recognize the legitimate interests of others\r\nand respect their rights, expand the zones of mutual\r\ninterests, give due priority to development and reject\r\nthe arms race. Such peaceful policies should also\r\nabstain from behaviour and political expressions which\r\ndisturb peace. They should observe civilized conduct\r\nin relationships among peoples, without the pursuit of\r\nany party’s privileges at the expense of others. No one\r\nshould claim an imaginary historical role outside the\r\nparameters of justice, equality and the rule of law.\r\n“The world today is indeed a small planet whose\r\nproblems interact and overlap. Its pressing problems\r\nare a global responsibility. When viewed through a\r\nhuman and global prism, we can see that the\r\nprosperity of the North pales in the shadow of the\r\npoverty of the South. The security of Europe will not\r\nbe assured against a background of a marginalized\r\nAfrica. There will be little peace of mind in America\r\nin the face of a population explosion in Asia, and with\r\nthe widening gap between those with an abundance of\r\nwealth and those who suffer in deprivation. Dealing\r\nwith the new developments in the world environment\r\nrequires the evolution of a comprehensive concept of\r\nsecurity. Any such concept must be anchored in\r\nunderstanding, coexistence, common interests, and the\r\nutilization of the universal technological revolution in\r\nmanaging vital national projects. This concept should\r\nreplace the outdated concepts of security based on the\r\nbalance of power, mutual deterrence and military\r\npresence.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\n“The achievements made by the United Nations\r\nshould provide the Organization with a further impetus\r\nto pursue the same course it has charted since the end\r\nof the cold war.\r\n“We welcome the movement towards the\r\nprohibition of the production, stockpiling and use of\r\nlandmines. This would be yet another positive step\r\nadded to similar measures, such as the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention, the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Despite such\r\ninstruments, some States continue to export weapons\r\nof mass destruction as a vital source of increased\r\nnational income. We welcome the regulations that\r\nhave been concluded to control arms, to reduce the\r\nlevel of nuclear threat, to tighten controls over the\r\narms trade and to increase transparency regarding\r\nweapons expenditures.\r\n“In the same vein, we cannot underestimate the\r\nachievements made in the area of peacekeeping\r\noperations, where the United Nations has managed\r\nto contain dangers and defuse crises in several\r\ninstances, although many regional problems remain\r\nunresolved and constitute flash-points of tension.\r\n“In this regard, we in Kuwait cannot but recall\r\nwith admiration the firmness with which the Security\r\nCouncil responded to the aggression by the Iraqi\r\nregime against the State of Kuwait in August 1990.\r\nThe Council’s response was characterized by\r\nfirmness in rejecting aggression, resoluteness in its\r\nconfrontation, and decisive action to abort the\r\naggression through a series of resolutions that made\r\nthe Council’s position perfectly clear. It started with\r\nrejection of aggression, then moved to deterrence,\r\nand culminated in decisive action. In all its\r\ndimensions and ramifications, that case has become\r\na historical precedent that might constitute the basis\r\nfor a solid background for dealing with any similar\r\naggression, irrespective of its origin, against any\r\nState.\r\n“But Iraq, despite the dire need of its people\r\nfor the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the\r\nSecurity Council, has not yet fulfilled basic\r\nconditions required for ending the sanctions. There\r\nis the question of Kuwaiti and third-country\r\nprisoners and detainees. This is a humanitarian issue\r\nthat affects several hundred families who still do not\r\nknow the whereabouts of their loved ones. Young\r\nchildren continue to cry, appealing for help to rescue\r\ntheir missing fathers. The ad hoc Tripartite\r\nCommission continues to meet in Geneva while its\r\ntechnical sub-group still convenes in the border area\r\nbetween Kuwait and Iraq. Despite the formal nature\r\nof such regular meetings, which attract media\r\nattention, there has in effect been no progress in\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\ndetermining the fate of these missing persons. In fact,\r\nthe Iraqi regime has been exploiting their fate as a\r\nbargaining chip in its diplomatic manoeuvres. Iraq also\r\ncontinues to refuse to return a great deal of Kuwaiti\r\nproperty taken from the public and private sectors, the\r\nmost important of which is an air defence system and\r\nother military equipment, in addition to the principal\r\nState documents, which have been referred to in the\r\nSecurity Council as State memory.\r\n“Among the other key obligations the Iraqi\r\nregime has failed to fulfil is the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, a subject that is being\r\nhandled by the Special Commission. In this context,\r\neven after seven years of formal acceptance of\r\nrelevant conditions, Iraq continues to indulge its hobby\r\nof procrastination, subterfuge and deception. Iraq hides\r\ncertain weapons only to acknowledge later their\r\nexistence after the Special Commission secures\r\ndefinitive proof of Iraq’s ownership of such weapons.\r\nIt denies having certain types of missiles and\r\nbiological components only to recant its assertions\r\nonce the international teams of inspectors discover\r\nthose items.\r\n“Kuwait welcomes Security Council resolution\r\n1111 (1997) regarding the extension of the\r\nimplementation of the provisions of resolution 986\r\n(1995), which aims at alleviating the suffering of the\r\nbrotherly people of Iraq. Indeed, the hardship faced by\r\nthe people of Iraq has long persisted, due to the\r\nfailure of the Iraqi regime to meet its obligations, and\r\nto its pursuit of a policy of procrastination and\r\ntrickery. Iraq is called upon to follow a peaceful\r\npolicy with neighbouring States in order to prove its\r\ngood intentions. This is a substantive condition for the\r\nmaintenance of regional security, which was shattered\r\nby the Iraqi regime.\r\n“We in Kuwait have gone through bitter\r\nexperiences with regard to the intentions of the Iraqi\r\nregime, which seeks territorial expansion, regional\r\nsupremacy, and military superiority at the expense of\r\nneighbouring countries and of their peace and stability.\r\n“In the light of our eager interest in the\r\nmaintenance of security and stability in the region, we\r\naffirm the need to preserve the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq.\r\n“The supreme goal is to build a solid regional\r\nsystem firmly rooted in common understanding among\r\nneighbouring States which seek to expand avenues\r\nof mutual interests. This can be achieved through\r\nrespect for and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of others, and through civilized coexistence\r\namong neighbouring peoples. In this respect, I\r\nshould point out that my country is concerned over\r\nthe continued existence of the problem of the\r\noccupation by Iran of three United Arab Emirates\r\nislands. Here I wish to emphasize Kuwait’s full\r\ncommitment to the decision taken by the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council on this subject.\r\n“I wish also to call upon the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran to respond favourably to the peaceful\r\ninitiative launched by His Highness Sheikh Zayed\r\nbin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of our sister United\r\nArab Emirates, to engage in a serious dialogue that\r\nwould take into account the inalienable rights of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates to the islands in question, in\r\naccordance with the principles of good neighbourly\r\nrelations, international law and the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\n“The question of the Middle East and the\r\nsuccess of the peace process there are crucial\r\nmatters for world peace and security. You follow\r\nwith us with deep regret the paralysis which befell\r\nthat process and the increasing frustration and\r\ntension throughout the region. The current stalemate\r\nhas touched off a flurry of threats and\r\nrecriminations. All this is the net sum of the\r\nconcepts put out by the Israeli Government\r\nregarding the frame of reference underlying the\r\npeace process in the region.\r\n“The Government of Israel has backtracked\r\nfrom the rules and principles of the Madrid Peace\r\nConference and has replaced them by extraneous\r\nelements which contravene the rules unanimously\r\nagreed upon by the international community as a\r\nframework for the peace process, namely Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973),\r\ntogether with the “land for peace” principle.\r\nFurthermore, Israel has not committed itself to\r\nimplement bilateral agreements reached with the\r\nPalestinian Authority, including withdrawal from all\r\noccupied territories, including Jerusalem. Also, Israel\r\nhas not desisted from its policies of annexing Arab\r\nJerusalem, its Judaization and expansion of its illegal\r\nsettlement in order to change the demographic\r\ncomposition of the Holy City which lies at the very\r\ncore of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this regard,\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nwe call upon the co-sponsors of the peace initiative to\r\nmaintain even-handedness while doubling their efforts\r\nto revive the peace process in order to achieve a\r\nlasting, comprehensive and just resolution of the\r\nquestion of Palestine.\r\n“The people of Palestine have suffered for too\r\nlong the excruciating pain of oppression, homelessness\r\nand neglect. It is the inherent right of the Palestinian\r\npeople to exercise self-determination and to establish\r\ntheir own independent State, with Jerusalem as its\r\ncapital, similar to other peoples who gained\r\nindependence, so that they may contribute, within their\r\nown capacity, towards building world peace.\r\n“Along similar lines, Kuwait emphasizes the\r\nimportance of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\r\nSyrian Golan, which has been under occupation since\r\n1967. This question cannot be ignored if we desire the\r\npeace process to be complete. Indeed, the peace must\r\nbe comprehensive, covering all tracks. It should be\r\nanchored in good faith, in respect for the rights of\r\nothers and in mutual confidence. In this regard, we\r\nsupport Syria’s position that negotiations with Israel\r\nshould resume from the point where they halted\r\ninstead of starting new rounds of talks whose terms of\r\nreference have not been defined. Kuwait also supports\r\nLebanon’s firm stand that Israel is duty-bound to\r\nimplement all provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978) and to preserve Lebanon’s\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. This can be\r\nachieved only by full, unconditional Israeli withdrawal\r\nfrom southern Lebanon, so that Lebanon could resume\r\nits traditional role in consolidating development and\r\nprosperity.\r\n“Kuwait notes with deep regret that ethnic,\r\nfactional and civil conflicts among tribal chiefs in both\r\nAfghanistan and Somalia still continue. We remain\r\nhopeful that the United Nations will take more\r\neffective steps to address these problems that have\r\ntorn asunder those two countries and have continued\r\nto undermine regional security. We also appeal to all\r\nparties in these two countries to put an end to acts of\r\nviolence and to put overall national interests ahead of\r\ntheir tribal and ethnic interests.\r\n“Kuwait lauds international efforts to implement\r\nfully the Dayton Agreement, which aims at achieving\r\nsecurity and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nupholding international legitimacy at this stage. In this\r\nrespect, we applaud the Security Council resolution to\r\nindict and prosecute certain political and military\r\nleaders in Bosnia and Rwanda for their crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\n“We live in a world bursting with events.\r\nDistances have shrunk, interests have grown, and\r\nsecurity dimensions have become more interlinked.\r\nAdverse developments in the South worry the\r\npopulation of the North. Failure of development\r\nefforts has given impetus to chaotic waves of hungry\r\nmigrants. Threats resulting from peoples’ frustrations\r\nhave become interwoven. But, in our common\r\npursuit of a better tomorrow, we must act on the\r\nbasis of a universal conviction that armaments by\r\nthemselves do not guarantee full security, that\r\ndevelopment is the core of progress, that dialogue is\r\nthe bridge to understanding and that serious work\r\ngives birth to hope. Giving is an obligation, not an\r\nact of charity. Respect among nations is a key to\r\nstability, and self-improvement is a motive for work.\r\nParticipation is the path to cooperation. Monopoly is\r\none of the evils of bygone days, and openness is the\r\nroad to a better future. Investments are the tools of\r\ndevelopment. Bigotry is repugnant to contemporary\r\ninternational relations. People prosper in a civilized\r\nenvironment that imbues them with the virtues of\r\ndoing good and giving, reaching out towards those\r\nin need and moving against the odds in efforts to\r\ncreate a world that exudes friendship and amity, a\r\nworld resting on the rules of international legality, a\r\nworld enjoying security, peace and prosperity.\r\n“Our last prayer is to bless Allah, the lord of\r\nthe universe.”\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nAblassé Ouedraogo, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBurkina Faso.\r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Sir, your rich experience in the United Nations\r\nsystem, your country — Ukraine — your current\r\nresponsibilities and your personality assure us of the\r\ncompetence and dedication with which you will fulfil\r\nyour mission as President of the fifty-second session of\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly.\r\nWe would like to extend our most sincere\r\ncongratulations and our gratitude to your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Ismail Razali of Malaysia, for a full, hard-\r\nworking and stimulating fifty-first session. We reiterate\r\nour encouragement and support to the Secretary-General,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nMr. Kofi Annan. We also wish to commend the work\r\nwhich he and his team have accomplished in only nine\r\nmonths.\r\nLast Thursday, 25 September, the Security Council\r\nissued a statement on the situation in Africa, in which it\r\nsaid:\r\n“The Security Council reaffirms the responsibility of\r\nall Member States to settle their international disputes\r\nby peaceful means and its own primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.”\r\n(S/PRST/1997/46)\r\nBurkina Faso shares this vision. Together with other\r\nAfrican countries, it has become involved in subregional\r\nand regional initiatives with regard to our brother countries\r\nof Liberia, the Central African Republic and Burundi, to\r\nname only a few. Burkina Faso, whose confidence has been\r\nstrengthened by that experience, reaffirms the inestimable\r\nvalue of preventive diplomacy. We therefore support any\r\naction designed to achieve that end, and call upon the\r\nUnited Nations to develop a genuine conflict-prevention\r\npolicy. From north to south and from west to east, African\r\nStates have been taking action on a continuous basis and in\r\na variety of ways to deal with armed conflicts, political\r\ninstability and internal disorder in our continent.\r\nAfrica is daily demonstrating its clear determination to\r\nsolve its own problems as a matter of priority by creating,\r\namong other things, a Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution. Having made the maximum\r\nregional contribution, therefore, to the resolution of these\r\nproblems, it wonders why the Security Council seems not\r\nto be responding. Where does the Security Council’s chief\r\nresponsibility lie? The worst thing that could happen to the\r\nOrganization would be for Member States to begin to\r\nbelieve that our common institution has two different\r\nyardsticks. Our statements and appeals would then no\r\nlonger be of any value, and our possible actions would be\r\naffected, and weakened.\r\nThe purposes enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter — peace and security and economic and social\r\ndevelopment — can only be attained, consolidated and\r\nmaintained by means of justice within nations, justice\r\namong nations and, therefore, justice throughout the world.\r\nThe task is enormous. The justice demanded would not\r\nimply the end of the influence of power, but it would\r\nindicate whether such influence was positive or negative.\r\nWith regard to disarmament, we must reaffirm the\r\nnecessity of working towards the elimination of weapons\r\nof mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or\r\nbiological.\r\nIn Africa, the illicit traffic in small arms has had\r\nnew and increasingly uncontrollable consequences,\r\nranging from an increase in armed criminal acts to the\r\nproliferation of armed refugees. This provokes and adds\r\nto the instability of entire regions. My delegation would\r\nlike to know what has become of the follow-up to the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative under resolution 51/45 L on\r\nassistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic in small\r\narms and collecting them.\r\nBurkina Faso welcomes the results of the Oslo\r\nconference on anti-personnel landmines, and urges all\r\nStates to adhere as quickly as possible to the Convention\r\nadopted in Oslo, and above all to comply with its terms.\r\nBurkina Faso remains concerned by all situations of\r\nturmoil, instability and conflict, from Afghanistan and the\r\nformer Yugoslavia to Cambodia.\r\nThe illusions harboured after the end of the cold war\r\nare now giving way to a contrasting vision in which the\r\nfactors of integration and disintegration in our world are\r\nbecoming clearer. In Africa, the tragedy in Somalia has\r\nbeen followed by tragedies in the Great Lakes region and\r\nthe Republic of Congo, while the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo is now embarking, with some hesitation, upon\r\nthe road towards restoration. In Liberia, elections finally\r\nallowing that country to recover, too, and to contemplate\r\nthe colossal task of national reconstruction are taking\r\nplace. However, in the neighbouring country of Sierra\r\nLeone constitutional order has been violated and flouted.\r\nBurkina Faso reaffirms its resolute condemnation of\r\nthe interruption of the democratic process in Sierra Leone\r\nas well as its adherence to decision 356, on the situation\r\nin Sierra Leone, taken by the Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity at its\r\nthirty-third summit meeting in Harare.\r\nWe welcome the significant advances made in\r\nAngola and urge all the parties, especially UNITA, to\r\nplay a constructive role.\r\nIn the Middle East, Burkina Faso is concerned about\r\nthe repeated setbacks to the peace process and calls on\r\nthe parties to ensure that acts of provocation do not create\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\na deadly chain of violence that would go against the\r\ninterests of the peoples of the region.\r\nThe international environment is undergoing a process\r\nof constant change under the combined effect of three\r\nphenomena: globalization of the economy and of threats;\r\nliberalization of markets; and the information and\r\ncommunications revolution. While we welcome the creation\r\nand consolidation of large economic and monetary\r\ngroupings throughout the world, the upheavals created by\r\nglobalization and the demands of a triumphant free-market\r\nmodel illustrate the fragile nature of the successes achieved,\r\nand show more clearly that moderation and justice are the\r\nbasic requirements.\r\nAfrica, like a patient being cared for on his sick-bed,\r\nhas heard and heeded the diagnosis and the suggested\r\nremedies, including programmes, projects, agendas and\r\nspecial initiatives. This continent, which is engaged in a\r\nconstant struggle, is achieving some results that run the risk\r\nof being wiped out by globalization, in that its international\r\ntrade is continuing to decrease as a result mainly of outside\r\nfactors, further increasing its marginalization.\r\nDeveloping countries expect the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, adopted during the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to be a catalyst for a new global\r\npartnership for development. The sincerity of the\r\ncommitment of each and every one of us will be judged\r\naccording to the effectiveness of its implementation. In this\r\nregard, and on all economic and environmental issues, we\r\nsupport the comments made on behalf of us all by\r\nTanzania, which holds the presidency of the Group of 77.\r\nBurkina Faso, together with other Member States, has\r\nasked for consideration of the need to review resolution\r\n2758 (XXVI), which excludes from the United Nations the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. In doing so, Burkina Faso\r\nhas no intention of violating the rights of another Member\r\nState. It merely asks that, given the new context, the reality\r\nof the Republic of China be acknowledged. This reality is\r\ndemonstrated by the many and various relations that the\r\nRepublic of China has in one form or another with most\r\nStates. A review would do justice to the 21.5 million\r\ninhabitants while work goes on to resolve the matter by the\r\nreunification desired by both sides.\r\nWhile we continue to call for respect for human rights\r\nand respect for freedoms, there is still concern that it has\r\nnot yet been possible to implement a position that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has affirmed and reaffirmed, year after\r\nyear. The principle of freedom of trade is overtly being\r\nviolated, and Cuba, a Member State, is the victim.\r\nBurkina Faso believes that the international community\r\nmust continue its efforts to convince all the parties\r\nconcerned that since the embargo and obstacles to free\r\ntrade have not yet resolved the dispute, new constructive\r\npaths must be explored.\r\nSimilarly, along with the current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), Burkina Faso\r\naffirms the need to find a solution to the dispute between\r\nLibya, the United States and the United Kingdom with\r\nregard to the Lockerbie tragedy. As well as the sufferings\r\nof the families of those who perished, many other people\r\nare continuing to suffer from the sanctions imposed\r\nagainst Libya. The Organization of African Unity has\r\nalways expressed its concern at the unremitting sanctions\r\nimposed on Libya and their humanitarian consequences\r\nfor its people, and has advocated a fair trial of the\r\nsuspects pursuant to accepted principles of justice and\r\ninternational law. With the OAU, Burkina Faso hopes that\r\nthe Security Council will give due attention to the\r\nproposal made jointly by the Organization of African\r\nUnity and the League of Arab States with a view to\r\nfinding a just and equitable solution to the crisis.\r\nSpeaking of the Security Council, a permanent\r\nmember of the Council used the formula that it is far\r\nbetter to support a proposal for change backed by a large\r\nmajority than to support a status quo that enjoys the\r\nsupport of almost no one. Such reform is now a necessity\r\nwith regard to which Africa has developed a common\r\nposition. Africa, which was absent in 1945, intends to\r\ngain recognition for its right to a place in the Security\r\nCouncil, in which most of the matters dealt with are\r\nAfrican. Two permanent seats and some non-permanent\r\nseats would represent the beginning of justice for a\r\ncontinent which, along with Latin America, has no\r\npermanent representation. Burkina Faso believes that the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, while including\r\nJapan and Germany, must necessarily provide equitable\r\nrepresentation for Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nIn addition to the Council’s composition, its\r\nfunctioning must also be reviewed. The future Security\r\nCouncil must no longer be a body that behaves all too\r\noften like a club for the privileged; rather, it must behave\r\nlike an institution imbued with the highest responsibilities\r\nand aspirations for the benefit of all, without\r\ndiscrimination. Without that understanding, reform will be\r\nfutile.\r\nAt the fifty-first session, I concluded by saying:\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\n“We are now seeing that the State is surrendering\r\ncontrol over certain elements of its sovereignty.\r\nEverywhere, structures and organizations with varying\r\ndegrees of legality are transcending States and\r\nestablishing transnational networks and relations. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that we keep pace with these\r\ntrends and adapt now and in the future our special\r\ninstrument, our common instrument: the United\r\nNations at the service of peoples. Political will is what\r\nwill make the difference.” [Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 20th meeting, p. 24]\r\nEarlier today, speaking of the globalization of the\r\neconomy, I also mentioned the globalization of threats. I\r\nhad in mind poverty, environmental deterioration, terrorism,\r\ndrug trafficking, pandemics and, in general, the great\r\ndisasters caused by man or by nature.\r\nThe United Nations is in this regard an irreplaceable\r\nand invaluable tool. We thank and most warmly commend\r\nour brother Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, who, in the\r\nspace of nine months, has produced proposals designed to\r\nkeep us all in step with the times and future challenges. In\r\nour quest for peace, security, progress, prosperity and\r\njustice, the Secretary-General is proposing that we define\r\nand redefine the instrument of our solidarity and our\r\ncommon condition. Burkina Faso will join wholeheartedly\r\nin this exercise and will support any movement that can\r\nlead us to development, which is one of the cardinal points\r\nof our quest and a platform on which all of the United\r\nNations essential missions can come together: the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\npromotion of justice and international law, the strengthening\r\nof cooperation for development, the protection of human\r\nrights and humanitarian assistance.\r\nWhile we welcome and applaud the generous\r\ncontribution a wealthy individual has made to the United\r\nNations, we must also remind all States that their\r\ncontributions are a fulfilment of solemn and voluntary\r\ncommitments. Contributions to the budget must be made in\r\nfull, on time and without conditions. This is also part of the\r\nneeded reform.\r\nThe developments we are witnessing are profoundly\r\ncontradictory. The future is marked by pairs of opposites —\r\nintegration and disintegration; stability and instability;\r\nwealth and poverty; health and incurable disease; the\r\nopening and closing of borders; democracies and\r\ndictatorships; inter alia. They, it is said, are the very stuff\r\nof life.\r\nThe pendulum swings from optimism to pessimism\r\nand then back again. To stop it as it swings towards\r\noptimism, we will need, as never before, to see to it that\r\nthe international community can find and cultivate the\r\nvirtues of inclusion and justice, for otherwise we will see\r\ndevelop before our eyes, to an increasing degree, a world\r\nof cruel and pitiless violence.\r\nThe United Nations is our chance for a world of\r\nhope, justice, peace and progress. Let us seize this\r\nchance.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Kamal Thapa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nNepal.\r\nMr. Thapa (Nepal): First of all, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Nepal and on my own behalf,\r\nI should like to extend to you, Sir, our warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly. I am confident\r\nthat with your rich experience in international affairs you\r\nwill guide the work of the Assembly to a successful\r\nconclusion. I wish also to assure you of the full\r\ncooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to offer our\r\ndeep appreciation and thanks to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail of the friendly country of Malaysia, for the\r\nenthusiasm, dedication and zeal he brought to bear on the\r\nwork of the previous session.\r\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I bring greetings\r\nand best wishes from Nepal. In every way, he is proving\r\nhimself worthy of the great trust the membership has\r\nplaced in him. Having shown his deep commitment to\r\nUnited Nations reform from the day of his appointment as\r\nSecretary-General, he has presented us with a set of very\r\nserious and far-reaching proposals of impressive breadth\r\nand scope, with a view to reshaping the United Nations\r\nso that it can better serve humanity in the years ahead.\r\nThe Secretary-General has asked us to make this\r\nsession of the General Assembly one of reform. We agree\r\nwith him that United Nations reform is the shared concern\r\nof all Member States and that the purpose of the reform\r\nis to strengthen the role of the United Nations and\r\nenhance its efficiency. In the aftermath of the end of the\r\ncold war, the world situation is continuously undergoing\r\nprofound changes, evolving progressively towards a world\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nof multipolarity which reinforces the core of the United\r\nNations Charter: peace and development in larger freedom.\r\nThe universal cause, therefore, is to make the United\r\nNations a more vibrant world Organization that is more\r\nproperly equipped, institutionally and financially, to meet\r\nthe evolving challenges of the next century.\r\nThe proposals of the Secretary-General complement\r\nthe ongoing intergovernmental process regarding the\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations, particularly financial\r\nreform and reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe United Nations, if it is to perform the mission set\r\nout in its Charter, cannot limp from one year to another on\r\nthe verge of bankruptcy. No country should bear an\r\nexcessive burden, but the fundamental principle of any\r\nscale of assessments should be the capacity to pay,\r\ncalculated on the basis of the country’s share of global\r\ngross national product. It also does not make sense that half\r\nthe total membership is assessed the same amount in\r\ncontributions. A change in the scale of assessments is\r\noverdue. Countries, rich and poor, must pay their assessed\r\nshare in full, on time and without conditions.\r\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council, the\r\norgan which bears the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, Nepal’s\r\nposition coincides basically with the position taken by the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, as reflected, in particular, in the\r\nCartagena summit Declaration and the subsequent\r\nDeclarations of the meetings of Foreign Ministers of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement. The Security Council should\r\nbetter reflect changes in contemporary political and\r\neconomic realities. It should be more representative in\r\ncomposition and more transparent in its functioning. It must\r\nbe more democratic in character. It must be more reflective\r\nof balance between the North and South. It must, above all,\r\nbe capable of prompt action when peace is threatened. The\r\ncontribution of Member States to international peace and\r\nsecurity should be the guiding criterion for the selection of\r\nMembers of the expanded Security Council in both\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories. Since the Security\r\nCouncil is the principal instrument of the international\r\ncommunity in the area of collective security, I must\r\nemphasize here that any reform must be the fruit of\r\nratifiable global consensus and must in no way diminish the\r\nCouncil’s capacity for prompt and effective action to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, the reform proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General, which deserve our appreciation and\r\nsupport, are categorized in three broad areas: management\r\nof conflicts and peacekeeping; strengthening and\r\nintegration at headquarters, and field levels of United\r\nNations development activities; and protection and\r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nToo often in the past, the United Nations has\r\nsuffered from a sore need for a capacity to act in the face\r\nof conflicts. The Secretary-General must be encouraged\r\nand supported financially to make use of his high office\r\nfor the resolution of emerging conflicts. When\r\npeacekeeping operations are mandated by the Security\r\nCouncil, the capacity of the Secretary-General to organize\r\nand mount them in time should be strengthened.\r\nPeacekeeping, to be effective, is dependent largely on the\r\nmaintenance of elements within the national armed forces\r\nof Member States that can be made available promptly to\r\nthe United Nations. Sixty-six countries are now\r\nparticipating in United Nations standby arrangements, and\r\nI am happy to say that Nepal is one of the 10 countries to\r\nsign the Memorandum of Understanding which commits\r\nmy country to contribute 2,000 troops, including doctors,\r\nengineers, observers and headquarters staff and 200\r\ncivilian monitors for peacekeeping purposes, at short\r\nnotice. It is high time that the rapidly deployable mission\r\nheadquarters became operational.\r\nNepal is confident that the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals for a new United Nations Development Group\r\nand a United Nations Development Assistance Framework\r\nwill provide clearer focus and direction to United Nations\r\ndevelopment activities aimed at sustainable development\r\nand the eradication of poverty. In Nepal, many of the\r\ndevelopment activities carried out by the United Nations\r\nare already practically integrated at the field level. Care\r\nhas to be taken, however, that in the name of integration\r\nor merger, the demonstrated strength of individual\r\nprogrammes, funds or agencies is not lost. We also find\r\nthe proposal for a Special Commission to look at the\r\ndivision of labour among the various specialized agencies\r\nacross the United Nations system very interesting and\r\ndeserving of careful consideration. With a view to\r\nachieving greater harmonization of international\r\ndevelopment efforts, Nepal feels the need for a closer\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and international\r\nfinancial institutions and the World Trade Organization.\r\nSince peace, progress and humanity are the core\r\nconcern of the United Nations, Nepal, as a functioning\r\ndemocracy with a deep commitment to human rights,\r\nappreciates the intention of the Secretary-General to\r\nstrengthen and broaden the capacity of the United Nations\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nin the field of human rights. We welcome the strengthening\r\nof the Human Rights secretariat and the choice of Mrs.\r\nMary Robinson, former President of Ireland, as High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. There could hardly be a\r\nbetter choice. I wish to congratulate the new High\r\nCommissioner and express the confidence of my delegation\r\nthat she will be an independent and credible defender of\r\nhuman rights. We welcome her determination to narrow the\r\ngap in the perception of human rights. She has rightly\r\nobserved that collective and individual rights are not\r\nmutually exclusive and that the scope of human rights is\r\ninterlinked with social, cultural and economic issues\r\nrequiring a broad approach.\r\nAs a signatory of all basic international human rights\r\ninstruments and a participant in the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights in Vienna, Nepal looks forward to the\r\nfiftieth anniversary next year of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights. Together with freedom of speech and\r\nbelief, the Declaration characterizes freedom from fear and\r\nfreedom from want as the highest aspirations of human\r\nbeings. Along with concerns for peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, it is right that concerns for human rights\r\nshould also be made an integral part of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nPeace in many parts of the world continues to remain\r\nfragile. Nepal is deeply concerned over the setbacks in the\r\npeace process in the Middle East. The settlements policy\r\nhas retarded the process. Nor has the spate of violence in\r\nthe region helped restore the mutual confidence without\r\nwhich no peace process can succeed.\r\nWithout a resolution to the Palestinian problem, no\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace will be possible in\r\nthe Middle East. We urge the concerned parties not to\r\ndeviate from their professed commitment to resolving the\r\nproblem through peaceful means.\r\nThe extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons and the adoption of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty represent a fine\r\nmoment in the history of nuclear-arms control and\r\ndisarmament. The Convention on Chemical Weapons has\r\ncome into force, to our great satisfaction. With the creation\r\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia and Africa\r\nlast year, we hope that efforts to create such zones in other\r\nregions, such as the Middle East and South Asia, will be\r\nrelentlessly pursued.\r\nDisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, means\r\nnothing if it does not provide security to nations and\r\npeoples. Only a complete elimination of nuclear weapons\r\nwill provide such security. It is in this spirit that we have\r\nsupported the programme of action advanced by 28 NAM\r\nand neutral countries, members of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, for the elimination of nuclear weapons\r\nthrough phases over a period of time. We are\r\ndisappointed by the complete lack of progress in this\r\nyear’s session of the Conference on Disarmament.\r\nNepal is in favour of strengthening the role of the\r\nConference on Disarmament as the principal global\r\ndisarmament negotiating forum.\r\nNepal welcomes the agreement in Oslo this month\r\non the text of a convention for the total ban on anti-\r\npersonnel landmines and will seriously consider signing\r\nthe convention in Ottawa in December. Landmines should\r\nnot be allowed to be used indiscriminately and to maim\r\nand take innocent lives, including those of women and\r\nchildren.\r\nWhile the importance of the issues of weapons of\r\nmass destruction cannot be overemphasized, it is to be\r\nnoted that it is conventional weapons that have killed the\r\nmost people throughout history. Therein lies the\r\nimportance of the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms. The work of the United Nations\r\nPanel of Experts on Small Arms, one of whose sessions\r\nwas hosted in Kathmandu this year, has laid the\r\nfoundation for future United Nations action in this area.\r\nConfidence-building measures and regular dialogues\r\nin informal settings represent an indispensable element in\r\nthe long and arduous efforts undertaken on behalf of\r\ndisarmament and security. I am pleased to note that the\r\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and\r\nDisarmament in Asia and the Pacific, located in\r\nKathmandu, has been found to be a useful forum for such\r\ninformal dialogues on disarmament and security issues.\r\nNepal’s consistent participation in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations reflects our abiding faith in the\r\nideals of the United Nations. Over the past four decades,\r\nNepal’s peacekeepers have served with pride in all\r\nregions of the world under the United Nations for the\r\ncause of peace. Many of the Nepalese Blue Helmets have\r\nlost their lives and limbs in the pursuit of peace. Nepalese\r\nsoldiers have served the United Nations with dedication\r\nand professionalism. Nepal will continue to serve the\r\ncause of peace by responding positively and promptly to\r\nevery call for assistance from the United Nations.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nThe adoption of An Agenda for Development this\r\nyear, following protracted and tortuous negotiations over a\r\nperiod of three years, is a welcome sign for the renewal of\r\ndevelopment cooperation between the North and South. The\r\nAgenda identifies groups of countries in special need: least\r\ndeveloped countries, Africa, landlocked developing\r\ncountries, small island developing countries and countries\r\nwith transitional economies. The usefulness of the Agenda\r\nwill be measured only in terms of its faithful\r\nimplementation. The provision of additional resources on an\r\nassured and predictable basis is a prerequisite to the\r\nsustainable development of the least developed and\r\nlandlocked countries.\r\nThe decision of the General Assembly last year\r\nestablishing the First United Nations Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty represents the long-awaited\r\nrecognition by the international community of the pervasive\r\nnature of poverty, which today is the greatest threat to\r\npeace, sustainable development and human rights. The\r\neradication of poverty, therefore, should be a core activity\r\nof the United Nations. We recognize that this is the\r\nprincipal thrust of the reform measures and proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General. I wish once again to pledge my\r\ncountry’s full support and cooperation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in this regard. Poverty alleviation is the priority\r\narea of sustainable development planning in Nepal. A\r\nmassive programme is needed to reduce poverty in a\r\nmeaningful way.\r\nThe rapid decline of living standards today in almost\r\nall the least developed countries and developing landlocked\r\ncountries is an ironic testimony to the gross marginalization\r\nof those countries, despite the new trade regime that is\r\nsupposed to usher in an era of prosperity throughout the\r\nworld. This anomaly is further compounded by the\r\naccelerating reduction of official development assistance to\r\nthe least developed countries. For the least developed\r\ncountries, and the landlocked among them, which suffer\r\nfrom additional physical handicaps, foreign direct\r\ninvestment cannot be a substitute for official development\r\nassistance for some time to come.\r\nI would like to affirm Nepal’s unreserved\r\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and our\r\ndetermination to prevent terrorists from deriving benefit\r\nfrom their acts. It is our firm position that terrorism is a\r\nthreat to both internal and international security and to\r\npeaceful relations between States. It is, moreover, a threat\r\nto the growth and functioning of democratic institutions and\r\nto the enjoyment of human rights all over the world. Nepal\r\nwill never allow its territory to be used by terrorists\r\nagainst other countries.\r\nNepal holds the view that States should create an\r\nenvironment in which people do not have to be displaced\r\nor flee their countries as refugees. The number of such\r\npeople is in millions and, in the words of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, unquantifiable. Nepal is also bearing the burden\r\nof refugees. Nepal being a least developed and landlocked\r\ncountry struggling to cope with the rising aspirations of\r\nits people in a parliamentary set-up with deep human-\r\nrights commitments, the burden is painful for us. We have\r\nreceived international humanitarian assistance, for which\r\nwe are grateful. The magnitude of the problem for us can\r\nbe judged by the fact that one in every 200 people in\r\nNepal today is a refugee. We uphold the right of the\r\nrefugees to return to their home in peace and honour. His\r\nMajesty’s Government of Nepal is determined to solve\r\nthe problem peacefully by dialogue.\r\nNepal is a founding member of the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Nepal is\r\nactively pursuing a policy of promoting regional\r\ncooperation and understanding under the umbrella of\r\nSAARC, an Association which forms a critical part of our\r\nbroad policy of peace, friendship and cooperation with all\r\ncountries of the world in conformity with the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and non-alignment.\r\nThe seven countries of the region are engaged in\r\nvarious areas of cooperation, including the suppression of\r\nterrorism and drug abuse, environmental preservation,\r\npoverty alleviation and the promotion of regional trade.\r\nWe are endeavouring to harmonize the policies of the\r\nseven member countries on important global issues. We\r\ndid so during the nineteenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Many ministerial meetings in the region are\r\nnow annual events. Foreign Ministers of the region will\r\nbe meeting in New York in an informal setting during the\r\nannual session of the General Assembly. SAARC has\r\nlagged behind other similar associations, but the countries\r\nof the region are persevering in their efforts to develop\r\nboth the habit and concrete measures of cooperation.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nA number of delegations have asked to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply. I remind members that, in\r\naccordance with decision 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply shall be limited to 10 minutes for the\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nfirst intervention and to five minutes for the second, and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Choe Myong Nam (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): We have been surprised by the fact\r\nthat the gentleman from South Korea this morning\r\nattempted to infuse antagonism and confrontation with\r\ndistorted allegations against us at the time when prominent\r\npersonalities of the world are engaging in constructive\r\ndeliberations on the enhancement of the United Nations role\r\nin the twenty-first century in an atmosphere of\r\nreconciliation and cooperation. We strongly reject his\r\nallegations, which are characterized by falseness and\r\npolitical illiteracy aimed at misleading world opinion.\r\nAs for chemical weapons, it was none other than the\r\nUnited States and South Korea that introduced and used\r\nchemical weapons in the Korean peninsula. Therefore, the\r\nSouth Korean authorities have no right whatsoever to talk\r\nabout the Chemical Weapons Convention. My country was\r\na direct victim of biochemical-weapon attacks by the United\r\nStates and South Korea during the Korean War in the\r\n1950s. The fact that South Korea, which is the offender, is\r\nslandering my country while maintaining a huge storage of\r\nchemical weapons is nothing but a deceptive plot to keep\r\nbehind a screen its preparations for new biochemical-\r\nweapons warfare. It remains exclusively the sovereign right\r\nof each State whether or not to accede to the Convention on\r\nthe ban of chemical weapons.\r\nSouth Korea’s imitation of exactly what was said by\r\nthe United States — which is the suzerain State of South\r\nKorea — in regard to anti-personnel landmines is arousing\r\ngreat disappointment on the part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nAs for the issue of human rights, South Korea is\r\nactually a human rights desert on the Korean peninsula\r\nwhich causes grave concern to the international community.\r\nThe present social system in South Korea inevitably leads\r\nto a systematic and consistent pattern of gross violations of\r\nhuman rights. This is because the national security law,\r\nwhich completely denies all rights and freedoms —\r\nincluding the right to chose ideology and freedom of\r\nexpression and opinion, which are stipulated in international\r\nhuman rights instruments — has been in existence as a\r\nlegal apparatus to prop up such a social system for the past\r\nhalf century.\r\nThe national security law has so far produced a large\r\nnumber of prisoners of conscience, including long-term\r\npolitical prisoners, and is still being used as a panacea to\r\nsuppress the non-violent political activities of dissidents\r\nand organizations, including “Manchongryon”, the South\r\nKorean student organization.\r\nAccording to initial statistics there are hundreds of\r\nprisoners of conscience, including long-term political\r\nprisoners such as Messrs. An Hak Sop and Han Jang Ho\r\nand many others who have been imprisoned for more than\r\n40 years, twice as long as the term served by President\r\nNelson Mandela of South Africa, who was once known\r\nin the world as the longest-serving prisoner. They have\r\nbeen languishing in prison cells 0.7 square metres in size,\r\nwithout seeing a single ray of the sun from the age of 20\r\nyears up to 60 or 70 years. Only after their deaths can\r\nthey be released.\r\nWhether thousands or tens of thousands more such\r\nprisoners of conscience are yet to be known remains the\r\nonly secret of the South Korean authorities. As long as\r\nsuch anti-human rights laws as the national security law\r\nlinger like a nightmare, the situation of human rights\r\nviolations in South Korea will remain unchanged. The\r\ninternational community has already stigmatized the\r\nnational security law as a root cause of the human rights\r\nviolations and called for its abolition accordingly.\r\nEven the United States, suzerain State of South\r\nKorea, could no longer protect South Korea and made it\r\nclear that the abolition of the national security law was its\r\nofficial position. It is imperative that the South Korean\r\nauthorities keep in mind that their regime cannot\r\nautomatically become a civilian regime simply by being\r\ndecorated with a civilian wrapper.\r\nWe take this opportunity to recommend to South\r\nKorea that it discontinue becoming the object of\r\ninternational denunciation by abolishing the national\r\nsecurity law, democratizing its society and unconditionally\r\nreleasing all prisoners of conscience.\r\nWe have much more to say to South Korea with\r\nregard to the four-party talks. The United States and\r\nSouth Korean sides explained that the proposed four-party\r\ntalks are intended to ensure durable peace on the Korean\r\npeninsula. In order to achieve this peace, the present\r\narmistice system should be replaced without delay with a\r\ndurable peace agreement and the United States troops\r\nstationed in South Korea should be withdrawn. This is the\r\ncommon sense which is crystal clear to everyone.\r\nHowever, during the previous two rounds of\r\npreliminary talks, the South Korean side strongly opposed\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nthe deliberations of these issues, contrary to the\r\naforementioned purposes of the talks. Instead it insisted that\r\nthe four-party talks should focus mainly on the issue\r\nconcerning the relations between the North and the South\r\nof Korea. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nmaintains its stance that it is undesirable to discuss the\r\nissue of North-South relations at the multilateral talks\r\nbecause this is an internal issue of the nation. Therefore,\r\nthe claim on the part of the South Korean side for the\r\ndeliberation of the internal views of the nation at the\r\nmultilateral talks is an expression devoid of any national\r\nindependence and an anti-national act to induce foreign\r\ninterferences.\r\nSouth Korea cosmeticized itself as if it were an angel\r\nin providing humanitarian assistance. This is nothing but\r\nsheer hypocrisy. To be frank with you, Sir, South Korea is\r\nclamouring ostensibly about the humanitarian assistance to\r\nmy country, and after turning its back it is resorting to\r\nsinister attempts to lay obstacles to the provision of\r\nhumanitarian assistance by other countries and\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental international\r\norganizations by saying that the assistance was diverted in\r\nfull for the use of the military and that there would be good\r\nfarming this year.\r\nIn 1984, when South Korea was afflicted by floods the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea generously\r\nprovided a large quantity of cooperation in a noble\r\nhumanitarian and compatriotic spirit. As long as South\r\nKorea attempts to use the issue of humanitarian cooperation\r\nfor its unjust political purpose, we have no intention of\r\nreceiving any cooperation as such. We urge the South\r\nKorean authorities to immediately discontinue abusing the\r\nissue of humanitarian cooperation to pursue their political\r\npurposes to stifle and isolate our Republic.\r\nAs for the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the\r\nSouth Korean authorities — who have introduced foreign\r\nnuclear weapons into the country to destroy our nation —\r\nhave not any qualification whatsoever to comment on it. To\r\nrepeat, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a\r\nbilateral one to be settled only between the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States. The\r\nSouth Korean authorities should just sit down and enjoy\r\nwatching the process rather than behaving ridiculously on\r\nthe nuclear issue. We sincerely wish the South Korean\r\nauthorities would behave with a spirit of national\r\nindependence, cease to depend upon foreign forces at the\r\nearliest possible date, and discontinue abusing the sacred\r\nforum of the United Nations for North-South confrontation.\r\nMr. Gorelik (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Speaking at this morning’s plenary\r\nmeeting, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic\r\nof Moldova, Mr. Nicolae Tabakaru, stated that there\r\ncontinued to be an illegitimate deployment of contingents\r\nof the Russian Federation on the territory of his country,\r\nand that this contradicted the principle of international\r\nlaw that foreign troops could not be deployed on the\r\nterritory of a State without its agreement. In this\r\nconnection, our delegation is authorized to respond as\r\nfollows.\r\nThat statement is in contradiction with the agreement\r\nof the Presidents of Russia and Moldova which was\r\nreached during recent meetings in September in Moscow,\r\nwhose essence is that the number of Russian troops in\r\nTransdniester are constantly being reduced. However, the\r\nfinal withdrawal of these troops without a political\r\nsettlement of the problem of Transdniester could lead to\r\nuncontrolled development of the situation, especially since\r\nthere are major arsenals in that region.\r\nAs is well known, the Russian Federation is taking\r\nan active part in promoting the earliest possible settlement\r\nin Transdniester. This role of our country was noted by\r\nthe head of the Moldovan delegation in his statement\r\ntoday.\r\nIt is our view that the problem should be settled on\r\nthe basis of defining a special status for the Transdniester\r\nregion while preserving the territorial integrity of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova. This principle was in fact reflected\r\nin the memorandum signed on 8 May this year in\r\nMoscow on the principles of normalizing relations\r\nbetween the Republic of Moldova and Transdniester.\r\nThe process of restoring normal life and dialogue\r\nbetween the parties is not developing as simply as one\r\nwould wish. A great deal of painstaking work is\r\ncontinuing, with the involvement of the Russian side,\r\nwhich is encountering certain complications and\r\nemotional features. These can be overcome only by\r\nmeans of determined and peaceful efforts.\r\nIn the framework of the close bilateral relations\r\nbetween Kishinev and Moscow, the President and the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Moldova show a clear\r\nunderstanding of this reality. However, in his statement\r\nthe head of the delegation of the Republic of Moldova\r\ngave a different interpretation to the situation. This raises\r\nsome questions, bearing in mind the fact that only a few\r\ndays ago the deputy Chairman of the Russian\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nGovernment, Mr. Serov, visited Moldova and talked with\r\nthe leadership of the Republic of Moldova and the leaders\r\nof Transdniester. During those negotiations, the Russian\r\nside did not hear anything similar to what we heard today\r\nfrom this rostrum.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that we are\r\nconvinced that the process of a settlement in Transdniester\r\nis possible, but for this it is important to retain its\r\nconstructive dynamics. From the Russian side, everything\r\nis being done so that this process can prevail.\r\nMr. Lim (Republic of Korea): It is regrettable, though\r\nnot entirely surprising, that our North Korean colleague has\r\npresented another typically unproductive statement against\r\nthe Republic of Korea. Although he referred to several\r\nissues, I wish to speak mainly about the human rights\r\nquestion for the sake of his own enlightenment and for the\r\ninformation of other delegations, as my Foreign Minister\r\nexplained in full detail our position on the other issues this\r\nmorning.\r\nFirst and foremost, I would like to ask my North\r\nKorean colleague if he truly believes North Korea is in any\r\nposition to call into question human rights anywhere in the\r\nworld. The concept of human rights is complex and\r\nmultidimensional, and therefore any debate on this issue\r\ntends to be contentious and inconclusive. On the other\r\nhand, however, discussing North Korea’s human rights\r\nsituation is simple.\r\nPolitically, it is a well known fact that North Korea\r\nhas been sustained by a totalitarian system which has now\r\ntaken the shape of the world’s first communist dynasty. Is\r\nthis a system which encourages, or even allows, political\r\nparticipation by its citizens? I seriously doubt it.\r\nEconomically, I am equally sceptical that the basic\r\nhuman needs of ordinary North Koreans are being met by\r\ntheir leadership — a leadership which claims it has created\r\na workers’ paradise.I wonder how it reconciles this concept\r\nof paradise with North Korea’s current economic situation?\r\nSocially, North Koreans live in the grip of\r\nunimaginable control and subjugation. Indeed, the\r\nfundamental freedoms of movement, speech and assembly\r\nare totally alien to the people of North Korea.\r\nOn the international front, North Korea has shown\r\nhow woefully out of step it is with the rest of the world by\r\nannouncing its intention to withdraw from the International\r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights in response to a\r\nresolution concerning the human rights situation in North\r\nKorea adopted at this year’s session of the\r\nSubcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and\r\nProtection of Minorities.\r\nIf anything remains unclear about the human rights\r\nsituation in North Korea it is always possible to refer to\r\nAmnesty International’s reports, which contain vivid\r\ninformation about, among other things, the large-scale\r\nconcentration camps for political prisoners throughout\r\nNorth Korea.\r\nAll in all, I believe that the description of North\r\nKorea in a survey of The Freedom House as\r\n“the worst among the most repressive States”\r\nprovides a quick summary of the human rights situation\r\nin North Korea.\r\nThe North Korean representative also spoke at length\r\nabout our national security law. What he failed to\r\nmention, however, was why that law was enacted. To put\r\nit bluntly, we needed such a law because North Korea\r\ncontinues to dispatch armed agents to the Republic of\r\nKorea, as evidenced by the North Korean submarine\r\ninfiltration incident last September. In fact, North Korea’s\r\nCommunist Party Charter still stipulates the reunification\r\nof the two sides of Korea under communist rule as a\r\nprimary objective.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, my delegation considers it\r\nnothing short of preposterous for the North Korean\r\ndelegation to question the human rights situation of\r\nanother State.\r\nIf North Korea still insists on discussing human\r\nrights it should first of all open its own hermetically\r\nsealed society to the world, especially to human rights\r\norganizations, so that we can all see exactly what is going\r\non inside its borders.\r\nIn the absence of any objective information or\r\ncorroborative evidence to the contrary, North Korea’s\r\nbaseless assertions will continue to ring as hollow as\r\nbefore.\r\nMr. Choe Myong Nam (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): I do not feel there is any need to\r\nrefute categorically the intervention of the South Korean\r\nrepresentative, which was again characterized by political\r\nilliteracy and went against human nature.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nAs all delegations have just witnessed, the South\r\nKorean authorities are still inciting confrontation between\r\nthe north and the south of Korea, even at this sacred forum\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nFor the sake of increasing the understanding of the\r\ndistinguished representatives, let me briefly refer to one\r\nstark reality. In recent years, the Governments of various\r\ncountries, international organizations and other relevant\r\norganizations — irrespective of their differences in social\r\nsystems, political views and religious beliefs — have been\r\nproviding generous humanitarian assistance to my country,\r\nwhich has been suffering from a series of natural disasters.\r\nWe are very grateful to all of these Governments and\r\norganizations for their sincere assistance.\r\nHowever, the South Korean authorities are attempting\r\nto destroy the international atmosphere for humanitarian\r\nassistance by bringing into the United States people who\r\ncommitted crimes in my country and defected to South\r\nKorea some years ago out of fear of prosecution. And the\r\nSouth Korean authorities have organized a press conference\r\nto take place during the current General Assembly session.\r\nThey are even saying that this humanitarian assistance\r\nshould not be provided to the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea, and that the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea has stocks of extra food. Under such circumstances\r\nhow can we communicate with the South Korean\r\nauthorities, who are devoid of humanity, rather than sharing\r\nour nationality?\r\nThese attempts are anti-national and anti-ethical and\r\ncertainly deserve condemnation from the international\r\ncommunity. This shows the reality of North and South\r\nKorean relations, which the South Korean authorities often\r\nclamour about.\r\nMr. Lim (Republic of Korea): I am once again rather\r\ndisappointed that the North Korean delegation has either\r\nfailed to understand, or pretended to ignore, how they are\r\nactually perceived by the international community. This\r\ntime, however, our response will be short, as we don’t wish\r\nto involve other delegations in a discussion the outcome of\r\nwhich may be easily predicted by everyone in this Hall —\r\nexcept, probably, one delegation.\r\nJust for reference, I would just like to inform other\r\ndelegations in this Hall that as the single largest donor, the\r\nRepublic of Korea has provided North Korea with $280\r\nmillion of food and financial aid since 1995.\r\nThe President: The Observer of Palestine has asked\r\nto make a statement in reply. I give him the floor in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolutions 3237\r\n(XXIX) of 22 November 1974 and 43/177 of 15\r\nDecember 1988.\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (interpretation from\r\nArabic):\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me first say that I believe that the arrangements\r\nby the Secretariat for this segment of our meeting are not\r\nconsistent with established practice. This is something,\r\nhowever, which we will discuss later with the Secretariat\r\n— under your auspices, Sir, I hope.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nHere in this Hall today the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Israel discussed the situation. I am surprised at\r\nhis extraordinary ability to give an opposite view of what\r\nis going on in the field.\r\nThe peace process in the Middle East is experiencing\r\na real crisis that — as a result of the current Israeli\r\nGovernment’s policies and practices — might bring the\r\nprocess to an end. Since its inception that Government\r\nhas adopted general guidelines that run counter to the\r\nagreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. That\r\nGovernment has also continued settlement practices:\r\nconfiscating land, bringing in more settlers and\r\nconfiscating more Palestinian natural resources. It has also\r\nexpressed its views through its Prime Minister on\r\ndeveloping future settlements which include the taking\r\nover of about half of the Palestinian territory that has\r\nbeen occupied since 1967. These views also include\r\nexclusive Jewish ownership of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) —\r\nincluding its Arab part which is under occupation.\r\nThese new policies have been accompanied by the\r\nescalation of repression of the Palestinian people: the\r\nimposition of a blockade on our economy, the prevention\r\nof movement of persons and goods, the destruction of\r\nhomes and the confiscation of the identity cards of\r\nPalestinian residents of Jerusalem. The Israeli\r\nGovernment has violated everything: international law,\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, resolutions of the\r\ntenth special session of the General Assembly, the\r\nagreements reached between the two parties and, finally,\r\nthe very bases of the peace process.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 16th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 September 1997\r\nThe Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs talked about\r\nterrorism. Our position is quite clear: we condemn\r\nterrorism. We have opposed it, and we believe terrorism\r\nshould continue to be condemned, irrespective of its\r\nsources. We must condemn terrorist acts committed by\r\nextremists on both sides, regardless of its size on the two\r\nsides or the losses resulting from them. Final elimination of\r\nviolence and terrorism will not be accomplished except by\r\nupholding the peace process and achieving the requisite\r\nprogress politically and economically. It will be\r\naccomplished by creating a different environment, one that\r\ncorresponds with mutual recognition, respect for the rights\r\nof the parties, instead of expansionist policies, arrogance\r\nand policies of repression.\r\nThe Minister warned against the United Nations\r\ndealing with the issue. This is ironic. He himself referred\r\nto General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 1947, which\r\nconstitutes the legal basis for the existence of Israel.\r\nSince then the United Nations has a permanent\r\nresponsibility for the Palestinian question, until it is\r\nsolved. This responsibility cannot end by the mere\r\nbeginning of the peace process.\r\nInternational law, including the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council, is valid and cannot be replaced or\r\nreduced in importance by any transitional agreements.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of Israel is a strong reminder of\r\nthe anniversary of the tragedy of the Palestinian people,\r\nwho are awaiting the fulfilment of the other part of\r\nresolution 181, the establishment of the Arab State. This,\r\nGod willing, will take place soon, thanks to our struggle\r\nand thanks to the support of the international community,\r\nwhich is based on justice and the desire to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nToday we heard about some positive developments\r\nin Palestinian-Israeli bilateral relations. We hope that\r\nthese will lead to the creation of a new reality that will\r\nsupplant statements such as those made today and that\r\nwill be in harmony with the bases of the peace process in\r\nthe Middle East and the agreements that have been\r\nreached between the two parties.\r\nThe President: There are no further speakers for\r\nthis afternoon’s meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.50 p.m.\r\n33\r\n"
